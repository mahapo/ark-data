They think it is more normal to use 2%, 5%, 10% or 20% of their brain and they may even brag about how little they use their brains?! These same people use all ten of their fingers without thinking that is it normal to use one or two fingers, so why do they use their brain any less than their fingers? All other mammals use 100% of their brains, because we see no degenerative, brain cell loss in their old age as we see in humans. Animals keep themselves healthy, fed and happy. They don’t create wars between themselves. They don’t greedily accumulate more than they need to use. They don’t frivolously preoccupy their time with mind-altering pursuits. They are industrious and productive, and they always have what they need, being in complete harmony with their environment. So why does man think and act so much differently than other species? Man begins life as a happy child, fun-loving and seeking to nurture himself, but helpless on his own. As the child grows, he develops preferences. He begins to think for himself, and learning becomes a constant experience. As the child becomes an adult, maturity and wisdom should naturally follow. The adult should put away childish things and understand how to live happily as an adult. Unfortunately, in making this transition from child to adult, many people create stressful problems for themselves. They even cease striving to mature, and become stuck in unfavorable, behavioral patterns like a needle stuck on a phonograph record. Religious references to the struggle of good vs evil typify the confusion that people have over what is right from what is wrong in their lives. Usually when a person wallows in the emotions of pleasure, anger, fear and lust, he finds his greatest difficulty in making any sense of the world. Things become very basic, and material acquisitions are sought to nurture these basic emotions. More money, more pleasure, more power and more things also seem to accompany more anger and more fear. We know the idea of what unconditional love, compassion, courage and lasting happiness are, but we don’t know how to achieve such emotions when our life is filled with mundane desires. We lose the awareness of our spiritual connection and we may feel helpless in understanding how to get into harmony & balance. The more we use our brain in a holistic, complete way, the easier it is to achieve that spiritual balance that we all seek."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"What we are today comes from thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind.\" -

Since many changes will take place in your life as a result of these exercises, it is advisable to keep a daily record or diary of your progress. Record exactly how much time you"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"  THE 100% BRAIN COURSE spend on each exercise. Don't let a single day or night go by without practicing some exercise, and note especially where you seem to have problems. Practice exercises in those areas where you are the weakest. Keep a small notebook or dated daily diary or group of exercise file cards with you during the day as a reminder to yourself. Eventually it will simply be natural for you to use your mind more. So prepare yourself for a better future, and use this manual to improve yourself, while noting in your notebook any changes in your life as you recognize them. You'll find the world a far more interesting and adventurous place when you do. Since The 100% Brain Course is a self-study program, you'll find it helpful to establish a routine involving several of the manual's exercise each day. With this plan or road map as your guide, you can make more effective progress in your growth. The following sample can guide you, but depending upon your personal preferences arising from your own individual needs and objectives, you can change the exercise routine to suit yourself. But remember, commit yourself to taking action every day toward your goal of improvement, then reward yourself by celebrating every milestone you make! 1) Just before arising from bed in the morning, pause for a moment and don't get up. Relax and contemplate any dream recollections you just had. Ask yourself what symbolic significance such a dream could have had for you. Assume your sub- conscious mind provided those images to you for a reason. By asking yourself what that reason might be while relaxed and immediately after awakening, your subconscious mind oftentimes will provide you with an instructive answer for the day (Exercise - Problem-Solving During Sleep). 2) When you do arise from your bed, give yourself a quick self-massage (Exercise - Self-Massage) and reiterate confident healing messages to yourself, like \"I am strong & healthy,\" \"I feel good about myself,\" \"All areas of my body are filled with invigorating energy,\" etc. (Exercise - Positive Affirming, Positive Living). 3) As you go through your morning ritual, be as conscious as possible without going unconsciously into an automatic mode (Exercise - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness). To assist this process, do things in a different order than usual or use your non-dominant hand for various tasks, like twisting off bottle caps, stirring your coffee, combing your hair, brushing your teeth or buttoning a garment (Exercise - Learning To Be Ambidextrous). 4) While going to work, reiterate positive statements to yourself about what you want to do, how you want it to happen and visualize yourself in the positive process all the way through to its completion (Exercise - Imagine and Mind Walk"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"  THE 100% BRAIN COURSE Your Goals). 5) Open up your mind and consciously drink in the sights, sounds, odors and bumps in the road as you drive to work. Observe the street signs and billboards and play at spelling the words backwards to yourself as you pass them (Exercise - Attention To Detail). 6) At work, make a point of delivering some complimentary word each hour to your work mates. Find someone you normally have difficulty with and sincerely compliment him (her) in a positive way on something unique to their personality (Exercise - Skillful People Handling). 7) Study people and step into their shoes and imagine what they are feeling and experiencing (Exercise - Role Taking As An Actor). See if you can tell what is going on inside their head or bothering them (Exercise - Scanning A Person). Ask yourself how they would experience what you are experiencing (Exercise - Experiencing Another Person's Senses). Note their manner- isms. Are they sincere, truthful, internally angry, confident or intently attentive (Exercise - Discerning Body Language). You'll get better at this as you become more aware of your own internal workings. 8) When you first meet someone new, take conscious note of their name and ask them how it is spelled (Exercise - Remembering Names). Study that person's face, clothes and demeanor and note any unusual features. Caricaturize something ridiculous about those features for better recall later (Exercise - Ridiculous Associations). 9) When eating your daily meals, consciously attend to the process. Observe the food intently, smell it, chew it slowly, savor the subtle flavors and how your teeth, tongue and gums react to each morsel (Exercise - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness). 10) If you become tense, tired or scattered during the day, focus on breathing rhythmically and deeply for a few minutes (Exercise - Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes). At this time, tune inwardly and ask yourself for inner guidance (Exercise - Asking For Inner Guidance). 11) Before retiring at night, relax in your bed and mentally visualize in a quick series of images all the events that happened to you throughout the day (Exercise - Daily Visualization). Reiterate positive statements to yourself as you breathe slowly and rhythmically to yourself. Visualize any goals you have in a series of images through to completion with total personal involvement and confidence that you will achieve them. (Exercise - Obtaining Money & Material Things)."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"  THE 100% BRAIN COURSE Some Preparatory Thoughts Before Doing The Exercises. 1. Calm yourself and your mind before doing the exercises. 2. Be prepared to DO the action necessary to accomplish each exercise. If necessary, make a pact or commitment with yourself to do the exercise as outlined so you know you’ve struck a deal with yourself. 3. Understand that the exercises cannot fix you -- you are responsible for yourself. Only you can fix you. 4. Be fully honest at all times with yourself. Keep a daily journal and tell yourself what’s on your mind before each day’s exercise routine. 5. If you don't like something that is going on in your life, say so. Then ask yourself what action you can take to fix it. 6. Recognize that progress comes one step at a time, and be prepared to decide on each step to be taken. Then take action so that your goals can become reality. 7. Be still and listen to your inner self-guidance. Hear your inner voice without any preconceptions and without overlaying it with the thought patterns that have held you back in the past. 9. Recognize that outer and inner changes will most likely happen together, because one is unlikely to occur without the other. 10. Be open to success, and to wonderful changes in your life. Expect them, demand them and know they will come. The 100% Brain Course is unique in that it covers a wide arrangement of exercises, spanning a full spectrum of brain stimulation, from emotional to physical to mental to spiritual. You must understand that it is not so much a matter of technique that allows a person to do extraordinary things that seem to transcend the physical laws of what we currently know as science. It is the spiritual development and awareness of the individual with his faith and belief in himself and his connectivity to everything else that allows extraordinary things to be possible through a person. The process of transformation must begin in the beginning. Advanced exercises should only be attempted after mastering preliminary exercises first.  “If a master does the same thing as you do,   .......is it the same thing at all?”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Emotional Management Section"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  1 Exercise 1 -- Identifying Your Emotional States If you were drunk or addicted to something or mentally aberrational, could you recognize that your behavior was different? Do you know what makes you cry or what makes you angry? Unless emotions are intensely experienced, many people find difficulty in describing or relating to their feelings. They sometimes even deny experiencing the emotions of love, fear, anger or pleasure, because of the lack of conscious awareness of such emotions. People may even feign love or pleasure to cover up unhappiness and low self-esteem. Some obese people are unable to tell the difference between being fearful, angry or hungry, and so they lump all those feelings together as hunger. Then they feel better about themselves by eating. The hunger for food and sex also gets confused in some people, whereby food is then used to gratify sexual frustrations. Sexually promiscuous people sometimes cannot distinguish between lust, compassion, sorrow, gratitude, kindness -- and love! When you practice identifying your emotional states as they happen in your life, you learn how better to manage them. You also learn how to honestly know yourself better as well. As an exercise with a partner, begin by identifying how you feel sitting in front of him (her). Are you excited, perplexed, pleased, enthusiastic, curious, embarrassed, confident, bored, elated, sad, happy, frightened, confused, aroused or what? Probe yourself, be honest and identify your emotions to your partner. Since your emotions are often only temporarily acknowledged, you may only have momentary glimpses of feelings as they pass through your mind. Consciously observe, tune into and identify your emotions as they pass, and relate them to your partner. Afterwards, reverse the roles, and let your partner do the same with you. By consciously identifying your emotional states, you begin using more of your upper brain regions involving mindful behavior. As another exercise, bring your conscious attention to a primary emotion you have been experiencing recently in your life, and identify this feeling to your partner. Where in your body do you feel it? Is there any discomfort or any pleasantness in your abdomen or chest area? Tune into any subtle changes that are happening in your mind or body. What other emotions do you find connected to it? Identify all of these to your partner. Then reverse the roles, and let your partner do the same with you. By identifying your emotions honestly to your partner, a close friendliness often develops that ordinarily would not be experienced with superficial conversation. If you practice identifying your emotions to yourself and others often, there will be"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT much more emotional clarity and integrity in your life, and your friendships will be based on genuine feelings rather than false pretenses. Not surprisingly, a self-healing process often results due to this more complete usage of the brain. A fter you get good at consciously identifying your various emotional states, you can practice using those emotions that make you feel good about yourself over those that are self-destructive before beginning a considered action. You can even visualize doing an action first, and study how you feel before you actually do it. Experiencing better emotions can improve your learning potential, your intelligence, your job performance, your interpersonal relationships as well as your physical health. By clarifying and identifying the emotional experiences that really make you feel good inside, you can better determine what you really want or desire as important in your life. The next time you experience a particular exceptional feeling, take the time to be mindful of it so you can remember it better and reproduce the feeling later when you want. Explore how your inner self is reacting to it. After a conversation or after reading a novel or after seeing a movie, get into and identify mindfully whatever emotions you feel. By doing this frequently, you'll be able to reexperience favorable emotional states more easily in the future while avoiding unfavorable ones. M any thought processes and the emotions connected to them are often uncon- sciously replayed over and over throughout the day and even throughout the night, and are directly responsible for your daily moods and behavior. You can change this unconscious inner movie with a consciously directed movie of your own. As an exercise, create right now a positive movie of your past experiences involving courage, confidence, happiness, unconditional love, compassion, forgive- ness, appreciation and enthusiasm to play over in your mind. (If you have trouble remembering such experiences, create instead a fantasy movie of where you would like to be or how you would like to be treated by some special fantasy person.) Briefly jot down the main points of those experiences in a notebook if necessary. Recognize and tune into the good feelings you are experiencing so that you can recreate those feelings whenever you need them in the future. Later, you should immediately use this inner movie to switch from any negative state, like guilt, depression, sadness, fear, anger, lust, worry, etc. You can also replay this movie just before retiring at night, and again just upon arising in the morning to positively jump start your day. By getting into past positive, emotional experiences and reliving them often, you can enhance the expression of those emotions in the present moment. Remember, you have the power to choose your state of mind to anything you wish."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  3 Exercise 2 -- Anchoring Positive States of Mind During the experiments with Pavlov's dogs, it was found that the physiological response of salivation during the anticipation of food could be anchored by an external stimulus like the sound of a bell. An associative neurological circuit was consequently established in the dog's brain that later allowed just the sound of a bell and no presentation of food to elicit the salivation response. Throughout your life, haphazard anchors get neurologically created whenever your mind and body are strongly involved together and a specific stimulus is repeatedly provided at the peak of a certain state. Afterwards, whenever the stimulus that acts as an anchor is provided, your response is to experience the state once again. An anchor can be an external or internal stimulus that triggers a physiological or psychological response. Just as a single spoken word given as a post-hypnotic suggestion can elicit the state of hypnosis, a single word, visualization or motor movement can also be used to bring about any other state you are seeking to elicit. How long a neurological link lasts varies, but the more individualistically unique the anchor is, the better its chances of lasting longer. How long a state lasts also varies, but a desired state can be initiated and consciously reinforced through a specific process. To effectively produce anchors as preferred behavior, the timing is crucial. The application of the stimulus must be at the peak of the intense experience. When you provide a unique stimulus as an anchor, repeat it exactly the same way a few times to effectively establish the neural pathway. If the unique stimulus is a touch, it must be in the same place and with the same pressure. If it is a word, it should be said with the same tone of voice and amplitude. The more exact the replication of the stimulus, the more effective the anchor. As an exercise to anchor the state of bold, powerful self-confidence, close your eyes and remember a time when you were powerfully confident in yourself, when you were assertive and in complete control of a situation, when you knew exactly how and what you were doing and when you were highly motivated to do something. Now step into that experience, and feel the enthusiasm and energy you had while in that state. If you have trouble remembering such a time, think how intense it would feel if you did have such an experience. Now holding onto that thought, open your eyes and stand up. Put your body into the postural stance best suited for this totally confident feeling you're experiencing. Now at the peak of this confident state, squeeze the knuckle of the middle finger of your right hand with your thumb, make a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"4  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT unique fist, and say in a confident tone of voice, \"Right,\" aloud. Now begin breathing in the way you did when you were feeling totally confident. Squeeze your right fist again in the same unique way, with the same pressure as you did before and say, \"Right,\" again in the same way as you did before. Now speak in the tone of voice that reflects confidence and say, \"I am taking emotional charge of my life.\" Exactly while doing this, make the unique fist in the same way, and pressure as before and say, \"Right,\" in the same tone of voice as you did before. Now think of a color that confidence reminds you of, and slowly take a deep breath of that color and make the same fist and say, \"Right,\" as you did before. Now feel the power at your disposal. Don't you feel terrific? Now go through the same anchoring process 2 more times for the best effect. Repeat this anchoring process for confidence periodically throughout the next week, especially just before an important decision or memorable experience, and notice the difference in your performance and recollection of the episode later. Remember too to fire off your confidence anchor prior to, and during any particularly successful episode in your life to reinforce the effect and more easily remember the experience. Many people reinforce and practice their negative emotional states more than they do their positive ones. Since you now know the procedure for anchoring, you can anchor any positive states you wish, and instantly have them at your fingertips (health, creativity, humor, decisiveness, appetite satiation after a satisfying meal, alertness, generosity, positive expectancy, security, prosperity, exhilaration, etc.). You can anchor each one individually by squeezing the individual knuckles of your hands a certain way for each state. If the behavioral patterns you've been using thus far aren't working to your betterment, you can always change them. Remember, if you do what you've always done in the past, you'll continue to get what you've always gotten as a result. You don't have to be a helpless pawn in life if you don't want to be."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  5 Exercise 3 -- Defusing Negative Emotional States Some of you have anchors (words, pictures, actions, etc.) that trigger you into automatic anger or vindictive states of mind. By rewiring these anchors, your undesirable states can be defused and controlled, and more constructive options can be accessed from your mind. For instance, since most people eat out of habit instead of need, you can rewire such programming in your brain through the use of anchors. Don't assume that such habits are beyond your control. Get conscious of the process at work here, so you can replace unwanted anchors with new stimulus/response linkages that thrust you directly into the state that you desire. By being aware of your states as they come and go throughout the day, you can begin to change much of your undesirable behavior. Some people stay in unwanted states longer than others, but recognizing and monitoring such states is the first step in implementing a counteracting state of mind. If you don't recognize a state as undesirable, you have no reason to change it. Next, you must also decide what triggering anchors elicited this unwanted state. Was it a word, a person's expression, a tone of voice, a thought, a song, a touch or even a taste or an odor? Oftentimes neurological anchors are set up at the peak of a negative emotional experience without your realizing it! For instance, suppose you and your girlfriend were robbed on the street by a thief. After the episode, the extreme anger you both expressed over the incident while looking at each other in a certain way could easily get anchored unintentionally. Then the next time you went out, you looked at each other that same way, and you experienced the same anger again. Suddenly your relationship changed, and you never connected up the anchor as being remotely responsible. To defuse unwanted states, you must create anchors for positive states to replace them. For instance, suppose your dog was just killed by a car in front of your eyes. At the very peak of your mixed emotions of shock, anger, horror and sorrow over the loss of your pet, someone gently clutches your left shoulder in sympathy. A few days later, a friend at the office comes up to you to ask your advice and again clutches your left shoulder. Suddenly you revert into the same mixed emotions of shock, anger, horror and sorrow you experienced over the loss of your dog. Your friend is nonplused over your reaction, and you are beside yourself for the rest of the afternoon. Solution: Recognize the anchoring device that triggered your response, the left shoulder clutch. This time fire off your anchor for confidence at the same time you ask your friend to clutch your left shoulder again. Your brain circuitry will"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"6  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT then have a choice of two conflicting states. Invariably the positive state will overshadow the negative or they will cancel each other out. Repeat the process a couple times, then test the left shoulder clutch for results. When you can recognize and eliminate the trigger mechanisms that produce your negative and unresourceful states, you can install successful, positive ones to replace them. Since certain words often serve as triggering anchors to undesirable states (fear, revulsion, anger, hatred, vindictiveness, etc.), look over the following list of words. Decide on the ones that create an adverse reaction in you. dummy slut wimp nigger wop pollack insensitive coward honky idiot snatch bitch insecure shithead asshole faggot stupid greaser red neck spook nitwit phony kike guinea cancer jerk nazi bastard spic whore cunt sleeze queer tit dago Now say one of the words that troubles you aloud and softly to yourself, but at the same time fire off your anchor for confidence to defuse its negative influence over you. Do it a few times for effect. Now take the next word that is emotionally troublesome and do the same procedure. Continue doing it with all the words that evoke undesirable states in you. Now whenever you hear such words, you won't react with fear, revulsion, anger, hatred or vindictiveness. Words only have the power over you that you allow them to have. When words create a negative emotion in you, they control you in a harmful way. Words of censure, criticism or \"I told you so\" may not be intended to harm, but nevertheless sometimes trigger negative responses from you. Now you know how to defuse their negative power over you, and turn their result into something positive instead. By mastering these techniques, you are transforming yourself into a more dynamic and resourceful person with all the power you need to succeed in any direction you choose to take. Even if you're not sure about the triggering stimulus of a particular state, at least you can recognize an undesirable state when you experience it. Once recognized, you can still trigger the anchor of a more positive state to replace it. For instance, if you"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  7 anchor a relaxation state properly, the next time your recognize that your are tense or anxious, you can replace anxiety with calmness by triggering the anchor for relaxation. If you can recognize fear when it pops up, simply repeat the anchor for confidence. When procrastination pops its ugly head, activate your anchor for enthusiasm or decisiveness to counteract it. Of course, the more consciously aware you become of the haphazard anchors that produce your negative states, the better able you can be in defusing these anchors and installing positive states."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"8  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 4 -- Anchoring Favorable States In Others Now that you have learned how to anchor positive states of mind and defuse negative states in yourself, why not apply these techniques to other people as well? Just imagine being able to suffuse your friends, relatives and co-workers with enthusiasm, confidence and joy, and now you'll learn just how to do that. A nchoring is particularly effective when you don't realize it's happening to you. TV advertisers and salespeople create and play upon your states all the time to establish your likes and dislikes over their products. Comedians create anchors to the states of humor and laughter in their audiences. Johnny Carson, on the old Tonight Show, had the whole country anchored with the unique, sideways glance he uses at the point he wants you to laugh. Hitler put people into intense states with the anchors of an outstretched stiff arm and the shout of \"Sieg Heil\" that was reinforced over and over. In establishing anchors in other people, you can either recognize an intense state that the person is already exhibiting and anchor it, or you can create the state you want the person to express and anchor it. For instance, suppose you were at a horse race and your friend's horse just won at 20 to 1. At the very height of his jubilation and glee, you clasp and shake his hand in both your hands in congratulation. If his state was intense enough, you might be able to see him experience that same jubilation again the next day by repeating the identical hand shake and clasping with both your hands again in exactly the same manner. It might be a good way to pull him out of the doldrums if he ever has a bad day in the future. A more formal way of course is to have him inwardly relive an experience in his past and step into it again. At the peak of his reexperiencing it, you apply a unique stimulus and anchor it. Now work with a partner and anchor each other with the feeling of contentment, happiness and complete satisfaction as a combined state. Read to your partner the following (his eyes can be open or closed, whichever is easier): Now search your memory for a time when you experienced complete satisfaction, happiness and contentment over something that happened in your life. (Pause) If you can't think of anything off hand, imagine how it would feel if such an experience did happen to you. (Pause) Say, \"Yes,\" softly to me when you are at the peak of this experience while you simultaneously squeeze your left fist in a unique way. (Wait for your partner to say, \"Yes,\" then lightly and immediately place your hand on the back of his right hand as a momentary touch.) Now breathe with satisfying, contented breaths while you continue to experience this feeling. (Pause) Now squeeze"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  9 your left fist in the same way again. As he does this, touch his hand again in the same way as you did before.) Now tell me how satisfied and contented you feel, and then squeeze your left fist again. (Pause and allow him to do so, then touch him again in exactly the same way with your hand as he squeezes his left fist.) Say to your partner, \"You know how to be satisfied and content.\" Now squeeze your left fist again please. (Then lightly touch his right hand again with yours in the same way you did before as he squeezes his left fist again.) Now reverse the roles and let your partner do the same for you. Many times loved ones engender ill will and negative feelings toward one another by experiencing negative emotional events together and anchoring them through touch, words or just the sight of each other at the peak of the negative feeling. Later when the anchor is replayed, the negative feeling is also replayed, and often it is assumed it is the fault of your loved one. Just as you can defuse these anchors when you recognize them, you can just as easily provide positive anchors with your loved ones at the pinnacle of powerful positive states that you experience together. Thus, when you choose to anchor the positive states of enjoyment, exhilaration, confidence, satisfaction and enthusiasm with your loved ones, you build and intensify your mutual pleasure and bring about a more constructive relationship."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"10  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 5 -- Eliminating Your Negative Feelings Since many unconscious anchors that engender negative responses are sometimes elusive to recognize, this exercise will help collapse these unwanted states. To begin this exercise, trigger your anchor for confidence, and get yourself into the most powerful and positive state that you can muster. Then open your hand and put that feeling into your right hand. Now think of a time when you were enthusiastic and exhilarated over something, and put that feeling into your right hand too. Now recall a time when you were feeling love, happiness and joy, and put that into your right hand. Now notice how it feels to have all those feelings in your right hand. What color do you think they would make all together like that? What shape or form would they take in your hand? What sound would they make, if you gave them a sound? What texture do they feel like in your hand? What positive words does this combination say to you from your hand? Now open your left hand, and place in it some negative experience or something that has been bothering you. It's not necessary to relive the experience, just think of it and put it into your left hand. Think of something that worries you or that you're afraid of, and put it into your left hand too. What is the first color this mixture in your left hand reminds you of? What shape or form would they take in your hand? Does the mixture feel light or heavy? What sound would come from your hand, if you heard it make a sound? What texture does it feel like in your hand? What words would be uttered from that hand if it could talk to you? Now with a pouring motion, pour all the contents of your right hand into your left, like a chemist with a strange brew. As you do this notice the changes that take place in your left hand in color, sound, texture, shape, words being uttered, and the overall feelings coming from it. Now clasp your hands together for a few moments until they feel balanced. Look at the previous negative experiences in your left hand. Do you feel different about them? You should feel good or at least neutral about those experiences. If not, do it over again. OK, now in a sim ilar way I want you to think of some famous person, friend or sage in the past or present that you like and respect very much, and put the image of that person in your right hand. Now put the image of someone you don't like or that you're upset with in your left hand. Now look at the image of the person you don't like. Now look at the person you like; then at the person you don't like; then at the person you like.

The higher your energy, the more difficult it becomes to experience lower, negative emotions. Love, compassion, courage and happiness resonate with high energy, and are stimulated by wide areas of brain cells in the cerebral cortex. Lust, anger, fear and pleasure are simple, low energy emotions prompted from specific spots in the limbic system of the brain, which is brain tissue about the size of a small fist lying underneath the 2 large cerebral halves of the brain. You can increase your energy by good exercise, better nutrition, better associations, better breathing habits, better music, better drinking water, better posture and better sleep (review “Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health”)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"12  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 6 -- Positive Affirming, Positive Living What can you accomplish when you imagine, affirm and feel that you can't? Images, words and feelings all are part of affirmations. Positively expressing that you can do something is a conscious stimulant to the upper cerebral brain regions. The more you stimulate and use the upper regions of your brain, the more neural interconnections are made and the more complete your overall brain usage. Also, when you are emotionally out of balance, bacterial strains in your body grow more profusely, just like predatory insects attack an unhealthy plant more than a healthy plant! Remember the last time you caught a cold? Were you unhappy or depressed? Was there recently a loss of someone or something, or feelings of guilt just prior to catching it? Many bacteria live on the abundant waste substances produced by the thought processes of repressed emotions. Research has shown that there is a rapid multiplication of streptococcus bacteria in the throat during emotional stress. Fear, worry and internal stress restrict the flow of saliva, and you need saliva to neutralize mouth acids and prevent tooth decay. Dental plaque is caused by the bacterium, Streptococcus mutans , which is counteracted to a large extent by the antibodies in your system. Your antibody level is increased with an improved immune system. Your immune system tends to lower its resistance level in the presence of repressed negativity, and there is a draining of your bodily energy needed to protect you against disorders. Many diseases occur when a lowered immune system allows microbes to develop and proliferate. Some diseases are initiated right after upsetting events happen or you have a serious bout with depression, worry or loneliness. If you understand this, then you must also realize that the self-healing process is largely controlled by your brain -- hence the effectiveness of the placebo. Just as harmful biochemical changes take place with negative emotions, beneficial changes take place when your thought atmosphere is positive. If you don't implant positive thoughts into the subconscious mind, it will draw upon whatever is being played for activation. By unconsciously prefacing your daily statements with \"I'm afraid that .....\" or \"I'm worried that .....\", you are unintentionally programming your subconscious into an acceptance of unwar- ranted fear in your life. In this exercise, read aloud to yourself the positive affirmations listed below, one at a time -- but read them at least 3 times each. Each time, imagine the meaning of the affirmation, and feel what you are affirming is possible in your life. If a particular statement is not applicable or acceptable to you, omit it.

Repeat especially appealing statements over and over mentally to yourself throughout the day. Feel them, and visualize them manifesting in your life. Affirmations have a power to them, because they can change your thoughts and thereby change your reality. Since the root of mental and emotional blocks reside in your subconscious thoughts, affirmations are an excellent tool to help you change old mind tapes and programming. If you object to the idea of positive affirmations, that's a good signal you need some work in this area. In all cases, positive affirmations can help to bring about positive changes in your life. Also smile a lot, it's hard to be negative with a smile on your face. 1) I am now becoming more productive and efficient in everything that I do. 2) I have great purpose, and I am now exercising the unlimited possibilities available to me in the world. 3) I am freeing myself now of fear, worry and anxiety, and I am at peace with myself. 4) I greatly believe in myself and my abilities, and I am now progressing steadily. 5) I am learning and growing daily, and I now find value in each new experience that happens to me. 6) I am now directing total health for my entire being and all my bodily cells. 7) I am secure now with my home, my work, my family and those around me. 8) My attentiveness and observational abilities are now improving every day. 9) I am now achieving emotional stability and balance in my life. 10) With boldness and confidence, I am now taking action toward my goals. 11) I am now taking action toward developing myself every day. 12) My physical skills and abilities are now distinctly improving every day in every way. 13) I am now achieving my correct body weight, and I am consciously improving my posture every day. 14) I now love, forgive and accept myself as I am. 15) I am coping, adapting and responding now to changing situations with ease. 16) I am prosperous now in all things, and I always have everything I need from God's abundant universe. 17) I am progressing constantly now, and I accept full responsibility for everything that happens to me. 18) Every day in every way, I am now feeling better about myself and my daily accomplishments."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"14  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT 19) I am now very youthful, healthy, strong, enthusiastic, happy and full of confident energy. 20) I now feel warm and loving and accept everything I create in my life. Intensely repeat appealing statements over and over to yourself throughout your day, especially before drifting off to sleep and before climbing out of bed in the morning. Write a few affirmations down on a 3\" X 5\" card to read throughout your day. To have more immediate effect with special affirmations of particular im- portance, you can write some of them down in a notebook 1,000 times, and see how the changes manifest in your life. The more frequently you use any affirmations in your daily life, the more likely they will sink into your subconscious and take effect. So practice using positive affirmations often. As an exercise for tomorrow, positively reinforce all your accomplishments, small or large, with a compliment immediately afterwards. To be in a good mood, read positively oriented material, watch positive TV shows, go to motivational seminars, be with positive people and say things to yourself and others in a positive way. Avoid any verbal criticism of yourself or others, because the negative atmosphere it creates can only hinder your progress.

By relaxing your body, your mind becomes calm and clear while your brain wave activity is slowed to the alpha state (7 to 14 cycles per second). You can create your own relaxation cassette tape or have someone read the following relaxation dialogue to you or you can mentally and progressively repeat the following points to yourself. To begin, assume a comfortable, seated or reclined position. Now close your eyes, and take several easy, deep, abdominal breaths. When you inhale, say to yourself, \"I am,\" and as you exhale, say to yourself, \"relaxed.\" Now starting with your toes and feet, bring your conscious awareness to each foot, and flex and relax each one individually. Say to yourself, \"In every way I am feeling better and more relaxed.\" Now move up to each leg and flex and relax each leg. Now be aware of your buttocks. Flex and relax your buttocks. Now bring your conscious awareness to your abdomen and stomach areas. Feel those areas flexing and relaxing. Now focus attention to your back area. Flex and relax it. Now flex and relax your chest area. Now flex and relax each hand and arm. Feel the sensation of your shoulders flexing and relaxing. Feel your neck muscles relaxing and becoming soft and heavy. Be aware of and feel the muscles in your mouth, nose and eyes relaxing. Let your jaw become loose and let your tongue drop. Now direct all the muscles of your head to relax. Imagine a warm heaviness spreading throughout your body. Now while continuing the easy abdominal breathing, scan the entire body for any tension and relax it. Now say to yourself, \"I am in complete control of all my faculties, and can achieve relaxation whenever I desire. I am now fully relaxed.\" In this totally relaxed state, your blood vessels are dilated, and more oxygenated blood is flowing to your vital brain areas for better functioning. Now begin imagining a specific color in your mind's eye. With each abdominal breath, you are breathing in that color of relaxation. Allow it to permeate and soothe all the cells of your body with each breath that you take. The color you have chosen to connect with your state of relaxation will be the same color you can use in the future to help you relax.

You can also facilitate a quicker relief of anxiety in the future by remembering to breath deeply, center your posture and focus your attention on what is going on around you.

Do you know what honesty really means? The dictionary defines honesty as integrity, truthfulness, honor or freedom from fraud. Why are people dishonest? Fear of pain or discomfort or the revealing to others that you did something wrong?! It was once said, that truth can only be told when the person telling it feels safe. It's sad if true, but if you’re filled with fear, you can’t feel safe and dishonest behavior often becomes acceptable. Did you know that each of the emotions of fear, lust, anger and pleasure can easily be found in the brain with an electrode touching a small specific section of the brain's limbic system? Some brain experiments with monkeys and human mental patients in the 60's uncovered this fact very well. On the other hand, the higher brain emotions of unconditional love, compassion, happiness and courage cannot be found in the limbic system or any other small area of the brain?! Why? Well, fear, lust, anger and pleasure are the emotions we share in common with all animals that have a limbic system. W hat makes humans different is the large cerebrum on top of the small limbic system. When you experience love, compassion, happiness and courage, brain scans reveal a wide area in the cerebral cortex lights up. In other words, a larger network of cells in the higher brain centers are used to experience these higher emotions. Most people have great difficulty with experiencing these higher brain emotions, because their whole life revolves around limbic system reacting instead of conscious acting . When you practice consciously using more of your brain, instead of less, you begin utilizing more of your God given potential and honesty is easier to express as well. R elationships suffer greater over the issue of honesty than any other. In relationships, agreements are established, whether expressed or implied, that presume that honesty will be maintained. When deceit, disloyalty, secretiveness, false promises, half truths and the habit of saying one thing and doing something else enter a friendship or a love relationship, real clarity about any genuine feelings is immediately jeopardized. Trust is shaken, and reasoning is skewed. How do you rectify dishonest tendencies? Whenever your focus is on the external things of the world, dishonesty becomes acceptable. When fear, lust, anger or sensory pleasures dominate your daily behavior, dishonesty becomes acceptable. By changing your focus to internal growth and practicing courage, love, compassion and happiness, honesty is easier to express.

Cl earer thinking, sincere emotions and heightened senses are side benefits to honest behavior. Muddled thinking, poor memory, unreliable emotions and dull senses are the down side to dishonest behavior. Dishonesty also goes hand in hand with a self-destructive body chemistry and ill health. You get good at what you practice. If you decide that honesty has better advantages, you must practice it like any other skill. By practicing honesty, you're automatically practicing courage. When you practice courage, you get a better handle on fear. When courage manifests itself more than fear in your life, real love is easier to experience on a regular basis. One supports, complements and assists the other. Saying one thing & doing something else or unfulfilled commitments, no matter how well intentioned, are broken contracts and hardly honest. Get in touch with such episodes when they happen. Recognize how they make you feel inside. Don't betray in your deeds what you profess in your words. Not wanting to be responsible for your words or actions brings about self-denial, which in turn begets dishonesty. Can you feel good about yourself when your life is filled with deceit and dishonor? If you can't, then honesty is logical for your emotional well being; dishonesty is not. As an exercise, study your actions and motivations each day for honesty. At the end of the day, write down the honest and dishonest moments you experienced during the preceding 12 hours. Learn to acknowledge and recognize emotional integrity in yourself. Consciously embrace it when it appears. If it feels good, treat yourself to it often. Practice honesty in every way. Your physical, mental and emotional health will respond accordingly. As an exercise in correcting dishonest tendencies, stop exaggerating on incidental matters in your life. The fish that got away is usually larger in the eyes of the fisherman, but more realistic in the eyes of the onlooker. This same exaggerating scenario follows many people throughout their lives as well. Whatever makes you look better if exaggerated, will be exaggerated. Partial truths are by definition also partial lies. Some people convince themselves that partial truths are NOT partial lies, and then the difference between truth and lie becomes acceptably indistinct. Total lying becomes easier, and internal conflict and confusion become pronounced. By eliminating your half lies, full blown lies are no longer necessary either. By being honest with others, you also become honest with yourself. Can you remember a statement you convinced yourself was right when you knew it was wrong? Admit to yourself this lie; then bring it to mind in its real and truthful fashion. Another example of honesty is giving back a $20 note that dropped out of the pocket of a"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  19 passing stranger, or reminding a grocery cashier she didn't charge you for a missed item. To help children build honesty in their lives, eliminate the accusatory tone in your voice when asking them about a mistake you think they made. Not doing so, only encourages them to to tell you a false story because they feel unsafe. Let them know that you accept whatever they have done and you forgive them, and whenever they decide to tell you a truthful rendition of what happened, you will listen. Also, remember, when you are honest, it sets an example for your children to be honest too. You’ll also find that it’s good business to be honest as well. People respond to honesty in business. Few people want to deal with a dishonest person, so it will build your trust, give you consistency, open more doors and strengthen more relationships to tell the truth than to fabricate a lie of some kind. Is omission of the truth just as bad as a lie? Couples are faced with this question when one is unfaithful. Is it truthful to keep silent? Isn’t the point of relationship to allow the other person to know you as well as possible? If your answer is yes, then you know the answer to the first question as well. What people often neglect to do in relationship is honestly communicate to the other their feelings prior to infidelity. If they practiced doing this, infidelity would not even come up. Getting to know and truly understand the other is very important in any good relationship. Omission of the truth is just as bad as a lie when an agreement, whether expressed or implied, has been dishonored between 2 people. Honesty is not a matter of convenience or something to ignore or forget to do. It must be practiced in every way, so you can always feel good about yourself. Dishonesty cannot be rationalized as OK in circumstances where you think it gets you what you want. It is wrong, because of what it does to you inside. Your mental, emotional and physical health & stability is always at stake! Let me give you one final word on honesty. Does honesty mean telling everyone you meet what you think about them every minute of the day? Obviously your thoughts and emotions fluctuate throughout the day about many things and about many people, so telling people what you think or feel about them all the time is hardly sensible. There is a time to be silent and a time to be vocal. For better clarity in your life, make sure that when you are vocal, it is the truth. \"If you tell the truth, you don't have to have a good memory.\"   .........

When you practice something enough times, you get good at doing it. You might not like what you are doing, but your brain has grown accustomed to a certain neurological pattern of reacting and it’s just easier to continue doing it, because it takes less energy! By being conscious of this pattern of behavior, you can choose to override your habitual way of doing things, and do something else. When you do something else, you get a different result, and surprisingly your energy is higher as well ! Your human will power can break any habit pattern, but you have to practice breaking habitual behavior to get good at it. Have you ever observed your friends and relatives year after year doing the same things over and over and getting the same unfavorable results and complaining about the same unfavorable things happening in their lives? Being outside their lives, it’s easier for you to see how they keep themselves where they are, but they can never see it?! Sometimes they even show an unmindful pride in keeping themselves a certain way, by saying, “I always do such and such when such and such happens. I’ll never change.” They don’t seem to realize that they can change the unfavorable results they get by changing the behavior that leads to such results! Perhaps you too have gotten stuck in certain behavioral patterns that keep you where you are right now! Maybe you have never learned to consider alternatives, or to think critically about your situa- tions and the alternatives that you can choose for yourself at any time in your life. W hen is the last time that you took a look at yourself and the choices you are making in your life? Have you learned from the choices you’ve made? Are you learning from these choices now? Oftentimes when we get accustomed to a pattern of behavior, we repeat that pattern over and over without thinking about it. We don’t have to like what we’re doing. It’s just that our brain circuitry keeps us reacting the same way, and it seems easier, like a needle stuck on a record stays stuck on the record, and it goes round and round the same way until you bump the needle off the stuck spot. If the result we get from our behavior is not what we want, the logical choice would be to change our pattern of behavior to get a better result, but we don’t often do so! We sometimes stay stuck in a situation, regardless of how unhappy we are and we feel totally helpless to change it?! Remember, if we do the same thing over and over, we’ll get the same result over and over. If we change what we do, we change the result we get, right? You have to mindfully bump yourself off the stuck groove in the record to enjoy the rest of the music, which can be likened unto a happier life. Such a simple axiom"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  21 eludes us when we do not lead a mindful existence. Now let’s look at how to go about the process of making better choices and unsticking ourselves from unfavorable patterns of behavior. The first step in getting unstuck is recognizing that we ARE stuck in some ways. Look over your daily activities and see yourself as others might see you. Do you see any set patterns that you go through that vary very little from day to day? If you have trouble with this, ask someone close to you what they think your stuck patterns are. Examine the way you react or respond to people, both verbally, emotionally and in an active way. Write down what you see in yourself, so you can look at the details. Are the results that you get from your behavior, the results you want to get? If not, do you see that doing the same thing will always get the same results? Here are some typical stuck behavioral patterns you might recognize: 1) Going to the same restaurant, grocery store or filling station. 2) Driving the same way to work every day. 3) Reacting the same emotional way when someone says or does a certain thing. 4) Buying the same brand name products or a car from the same manufacturer. 5) Eating at a specific hour every day or eating only certain things. 6) Making love the same way. 7) Thinking that only women do the cooking or that only men do manual labor. Now you might say, “I’m comfortable with how I’m doing things, why should I change my routines?” There’s a difference between being comfortable and being accustomed to something. You might not like what you are doing or you might not like where you are going or the results you are getting in life, but because your neural circuitry has gotten you accustomed to doing it, it takes less energy to continue doing it the same way than to try something new or different which requires more energy! Being mindful of what you say, think and do is only the first step in altering your behavior to obtain better results. The next step is the willingness to get unstuck from such behavior. You can know the right nutrition, the right exercise, the right emotions to have and the right environment to enshroud yourself in, but unless you have the will, desire, incentive or motivation to act on what you know, the knowledge cannot get you to a better place. You can have low energy or have various aches and pains or be ill or have a low self-esteem, but you can overcome all of these obstacles with your human will power! So how do you activate that volitional part of yourself that can make better choices? Through practice. To get unstuck from set patterns, practice doing things differently for a change. You have to be willing to experiment with yourself for this exercise to work. Whatever your set behavior is, do exactly the opposite of what you normally would do. That’s not such"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"22  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT a big deal, since it’s only an experiment anyway. Just try it for 24 hours and see what happens. Try simple things first. For instance, if you normally have to have a cup of coffee in the morning, try a juice instead or nothing at all. If you normally go to bed late and get up late, go to bed early and get up early. If you normally get angry with a certain person, be pleasant instead. Move things around in the house, but change things in your life! You’re not helpless about your actions, but you must be mindful of them in order to change them. Take the trouble and experiment with yourself in this way. Most people are so locked into their behavioral patterns, that the mere suggestion of doing something different like this is utterly ridiculous or they’ll come up with some reason why they can’t or won’t initiate a change. But if you “take the trouble” to do something totally different with yourself every day in your various set patterns of behavior, you’re on your way to getting unstuck from patterns of behavior that have kept you from getting the results you want in life. Get into the habit of recognizing recurring behavior in your life that brings about unfavorable results, and give yourself a gentle bump from the stuck groove in the record. Vary your food and drink choices and try different dishes from different countries. If you brush your teeth with your right hand, brush them with your left hand. Instead of the bathroom, brush them in the kitchen. When you keep varying your routines, it gets you in the habit of being more mindful of your actions. You’ll also begin to see better results in your life, but you must practice this exercise to get good at breaking out of your stuck conditions. One way to loosen yourself up in switching to new behavioral patterns is to play act with yourself. Actors and actresses know that in order to truly act out a new role properly, they must FEEL and BE this new person internally, and they practice, prac- tice, practice their new role over and over. You can do the same thing in your own life. If you recognize an admirable trait in someone that you would like to adopt, observe closely how they move, their posture and their breathing pattern & muscle tension. Notice what they say and how they say it. Then, take action, and move in an enthusiastic way with an effective strategy toward replicating the characteristics of the person that you've observed. You can also create an internal visual image of this model person and step into it in a fully associated way and become that person you wish to emulate (see “Exercise -- Role Taking As An Actor”). In conclusion, remember also that gratitude, trust and acceptance can allow you to flow better in the world, and learning those qualities can relieve many stuck conditions. Also, when you act in the spirit of service to others, all other thoughts are irrelevant. Then you are truly loving thy neighbor as thyself and life is complete."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  23 Exercise 10 -- Keeping Yourself Motivated Many people rely on others to motivate them into doing something. Self- motivation is a rarer quality, and it is also a distinct leadership trait. Most people do things for a reward of some kind, but some people do things because they feel it is the right thing to do or they feel good about doing it or it gives them a sense of purpose. Keeping yourself motivated can sometimes be difficult. Study yourself and determine when you are the most active and effective. When are you the most inactive and ineffective? How does the time of day affect your behavior? How does the type of activity, what you ate, the type of exercise or any particular thoughts affect your behavior? Gain as much insight about what contributes to keeping yourself motivated as possible. Many people think they know what they want to do, but motivating themselves to do it becomes another matter. If you coordinate what you want to do around your life’s values, you’ll find doing anything becomes easier. Too many people get caught up in doing so many things they don’t want to do, and they sacrifice their values in the process. What values do you have that make you feel good or excited? If you combine your wants and desires with the values that make you feel good or excited, it will be easier to keep yourself motivated. Find ways to express yourself writing, drawing, talking and creating. Remember the action is more important that the result. Enough self-expression will keep you in the flow of life and also keep you motivated. Since money is a big motivator with people, many people often do things they wouldn’t normally do. Drug dealers, prostitutes, porno peddlers and “step-on- people” type businessmen make a lot of money, but they lie, cheat, steal, connive and take advantage of people in the process. Their desire is there. Their focus and determination is there, and they will do whatever it takes to achieve the money they are after. Often, such perverse and decadent people also have lives filled with guilt, fear, loneliness, anxiety, hatred and anger, and sooner or later wind up losing what they acquired and dying in the misery they created for themselves, without ever guessing they created that reality for themselves! How can you create a strong desire to do what you know is better for you? One way is to trick yourself into being motivated by giving yourself a deadline by such and such time or giving yourself a reward after you do some chore or say to yourself that you’re doing something because someone special is coming. When 5 chubby men decided to lose 30 pounds each in one month, they decided on money as their motivation. Each put $5,000 into an escrow account to be forfeited to the others if in-"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"24  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT dividual success was not achieved in 30 days. With their desire to keep their money, each did succeed in losing 30 pounds in 30 days & each regained his $5,000 investment. To get motivated, stimulate the senses in some way. Male athletes perform better when watched by pretty women (their motivation is sexual). Smelling a well prepared meal creates a motivation to eat. Hearing a provocative concerto often creates a motivation for action. With children, the rhythm of rock music can sometimes lock them into a reactive mode of fun action. As an exercise in motivation, simply visualize the result you want to achieve and get yourself excited about the action it will take to achieve the desired result. People normally have a tendency to choose a path requiring less energy, unless there is a pleasurable reward they can obtain after exerting themselves. Stimulating the pleasure zone in the limbic system of the brain is one way to reward yourself. It is often called fun. Having fun requires a lot of energy and effort, but the reward is a broad stimulation of the senses in a pleasurable way. So always add fun to your life, especially after completing difficult tasks. Learn what stimulates you pleasurably, and create this stimulation as your reward. As an exercise in motivating yourself to complete simple or small tasks you keep putting off, play a game with yourself. Time yourself just to see how long it will take you to complete the task. Afterwards, look back on it and say to yourself, “This didn’t take so long at all! Why have I been avoiding this for so long?” Here are some other factors to keep yourself motivated. When you do something successfully, celebrate or compliment yourself. Reiterate positive affirmations to make yourself feel better. Read and listen to positive motivational books and tapes. You’ll find it easier to motivate yourself when you have higher energy, so review \"Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health\" for ways to increase your energy. Diversify your day and be grateful for your blessings, even the smaller ones. Excite yourself over your day and be as happy as possible. Describe to yourself the benefits about what you are about to achieve. Write it down for better clarity. Do some form of daily, physical exercise to keep yourself motivated. Always see that your personal needs are met throughout the self-motivating process. When you don’t sacrifice your personal needs, you are not working against yourself. Unfulfilled needs create chaos and imbalance."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  25 Exercise 11 -- Positive Statement Practice In one university study, it was discovered that people in a negative mood were more likely to believe negative things stated to them about themselves. Conversely, people in a positive mood were more prone to accept positive feedback. Since most people are exposed to more negativity during the course of a day than positivity, is there any wonder that people suffer from depression and low self-esteem at the end of a normal day? Negativity affects your physical and psychological well being, and some people get boils, colds or headaches after a serious burst of anger or hatred toward someone. Rage can even trigger a heart attack. When you look for a person’s flaws and point them out to others, this critical tendency creates distance between you and others, and makes you feel bad in the process! As an exercise, reverse this tendency of looking for flaws, and look for a person’s good points. Be generous with your compliments and praise toward others, and you'll notice a more favorable response from people. You must realize that your words command great power over people and yourself, and the brain manufactures all sorts of chemicals in response to your words. Mark Twain once said that he could live for 2 months on a good compliment. As a daily exercise in your home and workplace, begin and finalize each day with 5 positive statements toward someone. If you’re normally critical toward people, replace the criticisms with compliments. When you direct positivisms toward others, you not only change their mood to a positive one, but you also enjoy a positive effect for yourself as well. For a positive experience one evening, let a group of 5 to 8 friends do the following exercise: Have one person sit in the middle of the others encircled around him. Have a prearranged sheet typed up for distribution to everyone containing about 15 to 20 positive statements. From there you can improvise from the sheet to make up your own positive statements to say. Then each person in the circle takes a turn to direct a positive statement to the person in the center. After 10 minutes have elapsed and all people have had several turns and dozens of positive statements have been received by the person in the center, the next person takes his turn in the center of the circle and the center person moves to the circle area. Do this until everyone has had a turn in the center. With all the negative hits you normally take all day, this exercise will definitely give you a positive high. It also will give you more practice in issuing positive statements to other people. Words have powerful affects on people, whether you"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"26  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT mean them or not. (Caution -- The purity of the experience must not allow any nega- tive snickers, jokes, or comments during the exercise or the effect will be seriously lessened.) Below are some sample positive statements you might begin with. If you create a handout with these or similar statements for participants, you can create a steady flow of statements without interruption as you go around the circle. Here are the samples: 1) You look very healthy. 2) You are a sensitive and caring person. 3) I like you. 4) Your personality is bright and cheerful. 5) You have a very presentable appearance. 6) You have a captivating charisma. 7) You have a fantastic mind. 8) You’re a very attractive person. 9) You are a beautiful person inside and out. 10) You are pleasant and enjoyable to associate with. 11) You are a warm and good natured person. 12) You have many interesting ideas. 13) I like your dynamic wit and refreshing good humor. 14) You are an intriguing and well-balanced individual. 15) You have accumulated a lot of interesting knowledge and experience. 16) You are a stimulating and exciting conversationalist. 17) I feel good around you. If you practice this exercise at least once per week for 2 months, all participants should have a marked improvement in their attitude. During the normal course of a day, you might also practice getting into the habit of delivering at least one positive statement to someone each hour. Find something about the way they're dressed, their hair, face, body, personality or manner, and positively remark to them about it. The key to this exercise is daily practice."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  27 Exercise 12 -- Creating A Positive Encouragement Tape Besides causing psychological problems, fear, guilt and shame often cause heart trouble, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure and many other bodily disorders. So how can you get a handle on these negative emotions when they pop up and rebuild your self-esteem? Listening to positive statements directed to you via a tape can provide a unique benefit to you. You can use your own voice on the tape, but when the words come from another person, they often have a better effect on you. By playing an audio tape of positive, encouraging bullet statements in the morning as you wake up or on a car cassette player or at odd times throughout the day in your home, you can successfully saturate yourself with enough positivity to counteract whatever negativity you experience throughout your day. Select a 12-minute loop tape that plays the same messages continually every 12 minutes, and play it in the morning and evening. Let a member of the opposite sex (it seems to help attentiveness) read the following statements onto a tape (or make up your own statements). 1) You have a magnificent mind, body and spirit combination, and your potential is unfolding. 2) Think positively and constructively about everything, avoiding criticisms and judgments. 3) Feel good about yourself every day, and live your dreams in the best way you can. 4) Improve your skills, and progress yourself steadily. 5) You have extraordinary ability, so be confident in your purpose, take action toward your goals and feel a sense of accomplishment at the end of every day. 6) All the extraordinary things that men and women have done, you can do too if you just believe that you can do them and take action. 7) You can activate any of the unlimited possibilities available to you at any point in your life. 8) Enthusiasm is contagious, so be excited about everything that you do. 9) Achieve your desired body weight, and consciously improve your posture. 10) The eternal you inside your physical sheathe involves every cell of your body, so take control and consciously direct perfect health for yourself. 11) Learn from everything and everyone as much as you can. 12) You can be anyone you imagine yourself to be, so assume the role of whom you"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"28  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT want to be. 13) Life always works out favorably for you when you let it, so live your daily experiences fully and consciously. 14) Smile, be bright and cheerful, and people will look at you with warmth. 15) You have great power & ability, and you influence people more than you realize. 16) You have demonstrated many extraordinary qualities throughout your life. 17) Feel secure and self-confident in all that you do. 18) Accomplish your daily duties productively and efficiently. 19) Treat each day as a challenging and exciting adventure. 20) All your experiences are learning opportunities, so take full responsibility for everything that happens to you. 21) Accept each experience in your life and grow from it, for everything is changing and will continue to change. 22) Boldness has a magic to it, so don't hesitate; act on your thoughts and ideas. 23) Fret not over mistakes; simply use them as stepping stones to a successful outcome. 24) You are a dynamic, sensitive, adaptable, optimistic, understanding, creative, conscientious, considerate and well-balanced person. As a variation to this exercise, have the positive statements read onto the right ear track of the tape and the sounds of gentle ocean waves recorded onto the left ear track off the tape. Even when not played through a headset, the sound combination of monologue and ocean waves will have the desired effect on an ordinary tape player speaker. As you proceed throughout your day, you will be able to remember, replay and reinforce to yourself a condensation of the words and phrases previously heard on the tape. If the tape is played frequently enough, your mind will automatically run over the affirmations during the day like a conditioned response."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  29 Exercise 13 -- Fear Reversal Imaging The dictionary definition of fear is a painful emotion marked by alarm, dread or anxiety. To evaluate a fear's necessity for survival, you can use test it with the 'fight or flight' response. Is there protection available? Can you protect yourself by fighting? Is escape available? Can you protect yourself by running away? If you can't justify the fear by fighting or running away, the fear is unnecessary to your survival. Coupled with the emotion of fear are physiological responses that prepare the body for fight or flight. Muscles tense, mouth gets dry, palms sweat with nervous perspiration, gastric secretions cease, adrenalin is shot into the system, the heart beats faster and the blood pressure rises. If there is no fight or flight energy released by the body, the physiological changes can cause damage to the bodily system. Mostly this is in an accumulative way, but fear has also caused sudden psychological blindness, deafness or speechlessness, hair to turn white or even death. Fears can be based on a negative expectation of something, sometimes accom- panied by feelings of helplessness or some kind of lack. To help yourself, first identify what specifically you are fearful of. You might say you have a fear of flying, but in reality it is a fear of crashing. That is the negative expectation. How do you reverse it? You turn the negative expectation into a positive one. Do \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\" prior to this exercise. To reverse a fear of crashing in an airplane, first visualize yourself driving from your home to the airport. You feel calm as you approach the airplane and take your seat inside. See yourself smiling throughout. Everyone around you is happy and thoughtful. Your stewardess gives you a magazine to read and afterwards brings you a meal. Your flight and landing is smooth and peasant. You smile as you leave the plane. You proceed to what the trip was about -- visiting friends, relatives or business associates. You enjoy and complete the visit; then return to the airport and board another plane. After a gentle take-off and smooth flight, you land again and proceed home. If you perform this visualization exercise at least 3 times a day for one or two weeks prior to your flight, your fear should be greatly alleviated and flying will become expectantly enjoyed. The same process can be employed with any fear. First determine what the negative expectation is, then create a visualization to reverse it into a positive expectation. Everything in your life can be controlled by your thoughts. Remember, you can do anything if you think you can. Since you create your own"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"30  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT fears, you can eliminate them too. Worry is the inward dwelling on something you don't want to happen and should be avoided. When fear is associated with a feeling of helplessness in operating successfully in the world, visualizations can help alleviate this state of mind. Visualizations are very powerful to your body/mind combination, and chemical changes happen in your body as a result of them. If you visualize sucking on a lemon, you can bring about the physiological change of increased salivation. If you visualize being buried alive, the psychological change of terror can be brought about. If you acknowledge these principles, it naturally follows that correct visualizations can bring about beneficial physiological and psychological changes, right?!"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  31 Exercise 14 -- Guilt Reversal Visualization There are many reasons for guilt in a person's mind. A fat person might feel guilty about eating chocolates. A child might feel guilty about lying to his parents. A spouse might feel guilty about an infidelity. But how do you uneat something or unsay something or undo something? You don't. Then punishment is a natural recourse?! You either feel you must punish yourself or in some other way atone for your sin . Consequently a great deal of negative energy is built up in your mind and your desire for punishment can produce a great deal of self-recriminations in your behavior. Get in a comfortable, relaxed position and close your eyes. Take a few deep abdominal breaths and progressively relax all parts of your body from your toes to your head. Now visualize the guilty event the way it was done. See the effect you had on other people. Get in touch with it and experience it. See yourself as others see you, not how you think they see you or how you would like them to see you. Be honest with yourself. Now change the visualization and switch the picture to see the event the way it should have been done -- step by step. Instead of feeling fear, anger or resentment, experience it with love, understanding and joy. Look at it as part of the big picture of your life, not as an isolated incident. A great deal of negative energy will be released the very first time that you do this visualization, because you are at the subjective level when you review the incident in your mind. This releasing of your guilty energy necessitates no punishment whatsoever, and the act need never be repeated. The important thing is that once you have cleaned your mental house of guilt, don't rerun the same negative mental pictures that got you there before."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"32  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 15 -- Consciously Disciplining Yourself Consciously disciplining your life is always beneficial. Without discipline, you are ruled by your habits and your limbic brain emotions. Exhibiting no control over such emotions places you on the same level as the beasts of the world. The phrase, \"I'm only human,\" is usually used to excuse irrational behavior. Are you less than 'human' when you consciously exhibit control over your primitive urges? Hardly. Then practice using your will power, and show yourself you have discipline. It has been found that electrical stimulation of parts of the limbic system in the brain produces a wide range of basic emotional responses like fear, lust, anger and pleasure. Brain experiments in the 60's with monkeys and human mental patients uncovered this fact very well. Fear, lust, anger and pleasure are the same emotions we share in common with all animals that have a limbic system. When fear sweeps through a crowd in a burning building, it can turn into blind panic with all those that are present. When anger sweeps over a lynch mob, everyone can get caught up with the mood and quickly turn ugly. On a teenage, rock and roll dance floor, teenagers easily get caught up with the pleasure of dancing to a famous rock star’s music. Walking into a room filled with 50 fornicating and willing people can quickly sweep a person into similar behavior. Why are these examples true? When someone expresses anger towards you, you can get angry back at that person OR you can choose to get conscious and not respond with anger. If you consciously examine the emotions of the limbic system (anger, sex, fear, and pleasure) as they occur in you, instead of experiencing them automatically like a knee jerk, their dominance over you is minimized. By directing your conscious awareness into the subconsciously directed urge, the lower regions of the brain no longer dictate to you what you need. Who normally thinks about fear, sex, anger or pleasure? They simply occur and direct your life like a gut impulse without the tedium of conscious, directed thought, right? The limbic system requires 1/5 the energy that the higher frontal brain centers require to operate, so without practice using the cerebral cortex, it is just easier for people to use the limbic system. As an exercise (as long as there is no medical problem), do without eating for 24 hours. Simple enough, isn't it? Actually fasting for one day of the week is still practiced by many religious groups. It helps to purify the body. On the practical side, its costs nothing and there are no dishes to wash. Also, do without something else for 24 hours or longer that normally gives you pleasure. If necessary, visualize that you already had it, and the need for it should dissipate."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  33 While in your home with family or friends, don't talk for one hour, unless you're responding to a specific question. Do it for longer periods or at a party. After being silent for a while, you'll find that you appreciate and understand the importance of words in a more meaningful way. You'll also be amazed at how much more information you'll pick up this way. It's good discipline and it's good listening power too. The next time you meet someone, find out as much as possible about the person without talking about yourself. If he asks about your life, turn the questions tactfully around to him again. Do this without him suspecting what you're doing. As a drill in discipline, do something you normally don't like to do, but you know that you should do. If you are prone to putting certain things off, do them right away instead. If you say you're going to do something, DO IT. Don't confuse yourself with false promises. For positive reinforcement, remind yourself of your previous successes in exerting discipline over your emotional mind. Next, write a letter to a friend or relative without using the words: ME, I, MY or MINE. Stay up and work at some project all through the night, or create some other way to exert discipline for yourself. Discipline takes practice, so don't neglect yourself. Improve yourself. Think what it would be like to be without eyes, a tongue or your legs. Leg amputees have learned to climb mountains and play basketball. The dumb and blind have also overcome their handicaps through mental discipline in order to survive and cope in the world. Can you do less? After practicing discipline for a while, an attitude change occurs that allows your thinking to be modified. You begin structuring your life into NOT being led by your gut impulses. Doing what you want to do becomes a cognitive process, not a primal urge. Becoming conscious becomes enjoyable and you begin experiencing life on a higher rather than a lower level. You do things because you know they are good for your physical and mental health. You begin consciously choosing your thoughts, emotions and actions rather than allowing them to just happen randomly. It is not a forced process, but a natural one."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"34  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 16 -- Positive Energy Imaging Everything in the universe is interconnected in some way. Each one of your thoughts has some kind of an effect on the things in your environment -- from the animate to the inanimate. Thoughts involving emotions are especially effective in this capacity on both yourself as well as on others. Many of these effects are discussed in other exercises in this manual. Since your adverse thoughts have adverse effects on your health and well being, beneficial thoughts have a positive influence on your overall welfare. Assume a comfortable, relaxed position and take a few deep, abdominal breaths. Close your eyes and relax all parts of your body progressively from your toes to your head. Imagine that an inverted white tornado has enveloped your entire body with the small end leading up to infinity. Visualize the large end swirling around you and through you with purifying energy. All your hurts, negativities, and non-productive programming are being cleansed and washed away. Feel the energy flow through you with a tingling sensation. You are overflowing with this energy. You are radiating this energy from every pore in your body. Visualize all your fear, anger, guilt, depression, worry, loneliness and other negative emotion transforming to love, appreciation, joy, compassion, forgiveness and contentment. Imagine and feel it changing from negative to positive. Visualize yourself with a complete body and mind that is whole and well. Experience the clarity, and notice a feeling of freedom, joy and power spreading over you. Use this energizing technique any time you want to get clear of negative feelings and emotions.

A simple exercise in concentration can do wonders in breaking a negative condition, and it can also give you immediate relief! Choose an object, a geometric design, a picture or a candle flame, and while in a relaxed position, direct your TOTAL conscious awareness toward observing it. Empty your mind of all thoughts and distractions as if nothing else existed except that object or picture. Purposefully blank your mind of internal comments, evaluations or stray pictures. Do this for 60 seconds without interruption. If an interruptive thought occurs, or your conscious awareness fleets even for a moment to an extraneous sound or other sensory stimuli, start over again, but do this for one full minute. To illustrate, look at the black dot in the middle of the circle for 1 full minute without distraction.   As simple as this exercise sounds, you'll be surprised how casual thoughts or interruptions will try to creep into your mind. Concentration in this way does not mean grimacing with a frown on your face. It simply involves a relaxed focalization on one subject only. Once you accomplish this externally, do the same exercise internally with your eyes closed. Look at the subject matter first, then close your eyes and see it in your mind's eye. This technique rotates the mind's resonance from negative to neutral to positive, where a feeling of relief is felt. Afterwards, care must be taken not to have the same negative thought sequences shift you back again.

There is no pattern to the blind. It is just black. Concentrate now on that blind without allowing any distracting thoughts to intrude. If they do, push them back out of the way. Simply continue to concentrate on the black blind. When you can hold an expression of complete blankness for just a short time, you will begin to have a different perspective, where time and distance take on a new meaning. Continued practice gives you better and better control over the sundry idle thoughts constantly trying to invade your consciousness. When you can control your thoughts during your daily life, you're one giant step further on your ladder of progressive development. If it helps, imagine that you are a yogi or a lama that already has this power heightened to a fine tuned degree."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"38  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 20 -- Meditation After mastering the concentration exercises and gaining control over your attention, you are ready for meditation. There is a contemplative stage between pure concentration and deep meditation that you might experience. It isn't necessarily detrimental, but it is the point where you can hallucinate and relate what you think are mystical experiences. You should be very wary of visions encountered while attempting meditation. You could be easily fooled with false notions from this cur- ious limbo region between hypnosis and meditation. Just observe, proceed and experience any visions encountered, without judgment. Actual attainment of meditation occurs when you are able to focus entirely on one item, and then remove the item from your mind and become attuned with the universe. It's not making the mind go blank, but allowing it to go empty that creates this experience. Then you feel like you become one with everything and in control of your total being. In one way or another, you spend your entire life trying to find this web of kinship which joins you to all living things and to Universal Love. Finding it, you realize then that the Kingdom of Heaven truly IS within you. Meditation is an upper brain exercise that allows a person to experience the exalted higher emotional feelings so long sought after - selfless love, compassion, happiness, bliss, etc. After getting accomplished at experiencing these feelings, the adept can consciously recreate these emotions in his everyday life even without a formal meditative rapport. For beginning meditators, the simple exercise of observing and attending to your breathing is a good one. Choose a quiet place and assume a comfortable position in a chair with your spine erect. Relax, close your eyes and bring your conscious awareness to the rhythm of your breathing. Say to yourself, \"I am mindfully aware of breathing in,\" and then \"I am mindfully aware of breathing out.\" You don't even have to recite the whole sentence. Just say, \"breathing in\" and \"breathing out,\" to keep your mind on your breath. Notice the rising and falling of your abdomen as you breathe. Let your body become still while you inhale steadily and slowly. Feel the flow of your breathing. Notice how each breath cleanses and nourishes you. As thoughts intrude upon your consciousness, allow them to come and go without giving them further energy. Just witness the thoughts and bring your awareness back to your breathing. As you practice, you will gradually start to detach from these thoughts and cease your background dialogue. Recognize the changing flow of emotion in you,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  39 but don’t try to modify your feelings. Know that whatever you may feel is part of your flow of experience, and not a permanent state of your personality. Gently move back to following the movement of your breath. Keep this thought in mind as you meditate, “God is present, loving me as I am, and guiding me.” Realize the truth of this statement, and open yourself to it, but do not consider that by thinking it you are accomplishing anything. After a while, this thought will be in the background of your experience without actually articulating it very often. The length of time you meditate in the beginning can be as brief as 5 minutes several times a day, but gradually you will find yourself extending the time to 30 or 60 minutes in one sitting as you discover the inherent benefits. There is also the meditation on a sound that you generate, called a mantra. Some basic mantras are: ram, lam, ham, yam, aum or oom . After choosing a mantra sound (or other word sound you prefer) that intuitively feels right for you, resonate your mantra with utmost concentration in rapid repetitions for as long as one breath will allow. The resulting sound vibration sets up wave patterns throughout your cellular tissues that stimulate and harmonize your whole body. You can also reiterate your mantra mentally in the same repetitive way during each exhalation. This is good during potentially stressful moments throughout the day. After awhile, you'll find it will reverberate on its own in your mind without a conscious effort to repeat it. Devotees to transcendental meditation (TM) have displayed increased alpha and theta waves as well as a decreased blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen con- sumption. Correspondingly, this also promoted better relaxation and reduced anxiety during their normal day. Another meditation exercise is focusing your attention on the inner sound in your ears. You can perceive this subtle sound in the quiet of your own home. Sufferers of tinnitus hear this inner sound in their ears (generated from the cochlea of the inner ear) as a loud pathological noise. You can also meditate on the inner light in your head by closing and raising your eyes to concentrate on the 'third eye' point in back of the bridge of your nose. (Like when used in self-hypnosis, this physiologically enhances an altered state of awareness.) When you do this, you'll begin to see a speck of illumination. As concentration continues, the point of light expands gradually into your whole field of vision. Then veil after veil of vibrational light reveals itself until finally spiritual vision is achieved. Some meditators initiate the process of seeing the light by imagining it at first or by gently pinching their closed eyelids & producing a phosphene effect. Buddhist meditation involves 4 primary posture positions -- standing, walking,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"40  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT sitting and lying down. In each posture, you become mindful about what you are doing as you are doing it. For instance, with your eyes closed, bring your awareness to the act of standing and reiterate internally, \"Standing, standing, standing,\" over and over to yourself as you stand quietly with your hands in front of you. When doing the walking meditation, walk very slowly forward and say, \"Left ... foot ... touch,\" then \"Right ... foot ... touch,\" etc. Then turn around slowly and say, \"Turning, turning, turning\" etc. By being mindful of each step in the process, your focus is brought totally to what you are doing as you are doing it. The same procedure is followed with the sitting and lying down postures, and for all other daily acts -- eating, driving, working, etc. By becoming as conscious as possible throughout your day, you achieve the meditative purpose and all its benefits. In fact, it has been shown that crime is sharply reduced in the immediate vicinity of a group of consistent meditators. Beneficial health effects are also prevalent amongst meditators, especially in the relief of stress and its corresponding related diseases. Like all skills, meditation takes practice to derive its ultimate benefits. The more you practice it, the better you get at it. Even beginning meditators will benefit though from a growing peace, calmness and relaxation within their inner being. When you realize that nothing is outside and everything is within yourself, then you can transcend the limitations of space and time. This is the Self or God realization that the Eastern philosophies speak about. This is when there is no difference between knower, knowledge and known or between the future, past and present -- the eternal \"Now.\""},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  41 Exercise 21 -- Firewalking To Embrace Fear There are many firewalkers in many countries of the world, and no protective chemicals are ever used to accomplish the feat. What is necessary to walk over hot coals more than 1,200°F? What happens physiologically to prevent any bodily damage to firewalkers? When temperature-sensitive paint was dubbed onto the feet of one firewalker, it was found that his feet did not go over 150°F, while the hot coals registered over 1200°F. Some firewalkers maintain that their weight seems less and that they are \"lifted\" over the hot coals. Others speak of how their legs and feet feel cold when walking over fire. There is evidence to indicate that the body's vascular system constricts to reduce blood circulation in the feet. Also, the activity of a substance called bradykinin, which plays a role in the inflammation process, is suppressed. It seems that physiological changes, brought about by the faith and belief that you can do the feat, prevent any bodily damage. Some researchers have found that many firewalkers experience short bursts of theta rhythm when walking over the coals. Preparation in a psychological way is necessary prior to the event. Tolly Burkan and others have lectured and given workshops in the U.S. on the power of courage & positive thinking, and thus far thousands of people have walked over a 6-foot trench of fiery coals stoked to over 1,200°F as a result. Tolly explains, \"You're not walking over hot coals, you're walking on fear!\" In other exercises, we have discussed the physiological changes that occur in the body when fear and negative emotions are generated. The body has a natural ability to heal, repair and protect itself from harm. That process is interrupted and inhibited by fear and negative emotions. When you eliminate fear from the firewalking pro- cess, you automatically allow courage, faith and belief to alter the body’s physiology accordingly. All firewalkers seem to achieve a certain altered state of consciousness. In many countries, they prepare themselves with one or two weeks of fasting, prayer, meditation and devotional chants. U.S. firewalking leaders usually prepare their participants with pep talks & positive programming designed to change preconceived belief systems about the dangers of fire so they can get in touch with their inner courage and eliminate their fear. Nobody is forced to do anything against his or her own will. Participation is purely voluntary. As an exercise, firewalking should only be initiated with an experienced leader that has done it before. You should first master \"Exercise -- Meditation,\" \"Exercise --"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"42  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Concentration To Relieve Stress,\" and all the breathing exercises. If you have any reservations about entering the fire, make a list of them on paper. By transcribing your prior programming and fears onto paper, you get them out of the mind for direct confrontation and examination. Understand that the burning coals are very hot -- over 1,200°F. When you step onto the coals, they may even feel hot. If your brain starts screaming, \"I'm burning myself,\" ignore it and SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION. If you shift your conscious awareness away from your feet, you will hardly notice the heat being any more intense than walking barefoot across hot sand on a summer day. Your flesh is not being charred. Simply don't panic and disrupt the even pressure of your soles on the coals as you walk evenly along. By concentrating your conscious awareness to an inner visualization or connection, you're NOT attending to the feeling in your feet. Shifting your conscious awareness away from your feet allows a vascular constriction to be achieved (review \"Exercise -- Shifting Your Conscious Awareness\"). Some people even reiterate, \"Cool, moss, cool moss,\" as they walk across the hot coals. After the firewalk, maintain your shift of attention through positive discussion and distraction. By continuing this focused shift, your body/mind will maintain its control over any after-sensations as well. Hypnosis is an altered state that can eliminate doubt. If you were told under hypnosis a piece of ice was a hot iron, a blister would form because you believed it would. Your belief programming in life is similar. The simple act of stepping onto glowing coals demonstrates to yourself that you will NOT be harmed, and your body alters itself physiologically to accommodate that positive thought process and protects itself. Some people reinforce the process by reiterating, \"My body will do whatever it takes to protect itself while I'm firewalking.\" Obviously, if you thought that you would burn yourself, you wouldn't have taken the first step! The first step is all it takes to firewalk. Remember, trust your inner self and be aware of your true connection to God (\"...when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned\" Isa. 43:2). Thousands of people have successfully firewalked before you, and they did so without hesitation. After firewalking, the success of such a feat leads to exhilaration. A special camaraderie is established with the participants, and you become more open and honest in a sharing way."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  43 Exercise 22 -- Connected Breathing For Increased Energy The purpose of conscious, connected breathing is not for the movement of air, but rather for the movement of energy. By doing relaxed, connected breathing for a few minutes, you begin to experience dynamic energy flowing throughout your body. The more that you practice it, the more relaxed and peaceful you feel. In Eastern philosophies, this flowing of energy via conscious, connected breathing is the merging of spirit and matter. It creates harmony between your body, mind and soul. B reathing is such a simple thing, but conscious breathing involves activating the upper cortical brain cells. If you inhale and hold your breath to lift a weight, you maintain control until the breath is released. Normally you involuntarily breathe 14 to 18 times a minute. The more excitable you are, the more breaths per minute you take. When you're reading a book, you breathe differently than when you're making love. Different physical activities and mental states require different modes of breathing. For instance, fear, worry and depression often interfere with proper breathing. Gradual oxygen deprivation can in turn cause mental and physical impairment. The amount of air you inspire is known as your vital capacity and can be measured by a watch-size instrument called a spirometer. To test your expiration capacity, take a deep breath, open your mouth wide (no pursed lips) and see if you can blow out a match held 3 inches from your lips. If you can't, you need help. To illustrate how you can voluntarily control your breathing, take a deep, abdom- inal breath, and read the following paragraph aloud without inhaling. Powerful effects can be felt by controlling your inhalation and exhalation in a connected way. By gently, but deeply breathing in and out without a pause in between, you can supercharge your system with energizing oxygen. Maintain this connected breathing in a relaxed rhythm (don't force yourself into a hyperventilating syndrome) for an hour a day for 30 consecutive days, and you will feel far more able to successfully accomplish many of the other exercises in this manual. Your stress and negative emotions will dissipate too. There is a merging of your pure life energy with the air you breathe that will send vibrations throughout your body in a cleansing, nourishing way. By controlling your breathing in this way, you can physically extend your life. Connected breathing is a relaxing and natural process that can leave you with a euphoric feeling. It is a very cleansing process that can also clear out physical, mental and emotional blocks. About 3% of the body’s wastes are eliminated by defecation and 7% by urination. The skin excretes another 20%, leaving the remain-"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"44  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT ing 70% to be breathed out. Maintaining connected deep breathing for about an hour can also slip you into an altered state of consciousness where old images and feelings come to mind. These patterns can be consciously observed, and allowed to pass on without their having any psychological effect on you! As an adjunct to the above exercise, take in a deep, abdominal breath and hold it. Now stick your tongue out and bring the air up as if to exhale, but instead put a throat lock on it and gag. The gagging noise is not necessary, but directing the air and 'life energy' to your brain and eyes is important. Some people experience a similar action while having a bowel movement. \"... It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\" (Matt. 4:4) If your essence is part of God's universal essence, could not your affirmations and visualizations be directed to help produce the necessary sustenance for survival? Breatharians are people that utilize breath and combine it with light to manufacture food for their bodies. This 'animal photosynthetic' process is little understood, for breatharians cut down their ingested food intake to little or nothing at all. When Jack Schwarz was studied by the Menninger Foundation, he ate one bowl of rice per week and defecated 3 full bowel movements per day. Since his body weight remained the same, where did the extra dross material come from? Perhaps everyone is a breatharian in some way, because each person metabolizes the same amount of food differently. Does the process go beyond metabolism? Do you actually assimilate the elements of light, air and some universal energy to create auxiliary amounts of food? Have you ever had the feeling of \"being full\" and not wanting to eat after a sun bath? When fasting, visualize having eaten a sumptuous meal and notice the satiated effect. Hunger is more often a subconscious habit than it is a necessity. The overweight population of the world attests to this observation. Maintaining conscious control over your life negates this tendency to overeat. In fact, through the power of visualization and your inner 'knowingness,' you can really eat what you want and still lose weight. By such inner control, the elements of your ingested food can be either assimilated or passed. Your metabolic rate can be either stepped up or slowed, and you learn that you are in complete charge of your bodily functions."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  45 Exercise 23 -- Cleansing Breath For Better Health Surprising to Westerners is the fact that good controlled breathing has a great deal to do with all the extranormal powers exhibited by yogis and lamas of the East. How could such a simple thing like breathing be connected to better mental powers? The Hindus call breathing exercises pranayama, which is the control of the prana or subtle \"life\" energy of your breath. Food and drink are important, but if your breath ceases, all other manifestations of energy and movement of your body stop automatically. When you control the motion of your lungs, you control the subtle prana. When your life energy is controlled, every part of your body can be filled with it and bodily control is much easier. All diseases of your body can be eliminated by controlling and regulating your life energy, and it brings about the power of healing. If your body is strong and healthy with an abundance of life energy, your radiating vibrations will benefit the people around you as well. In ordinary breathing, you extract very little energy, but when you consciously regulate your breathing, you are able to store up in your various nerve centers and brain a greater amount of this vitalizing energy. It makes sense, doesn't it? You're supercharging your cells with oxygen which is better than depleting them of it. Now sit up in a comfortable position with good posture and place your hand on your upper abdomen to feel the motion of your diaphragm. Now forcibly exhale, pushing your stomach in with a backward push so that your diaphragm recedes into your thoracic cavity, expelling the air from your lungs. Follow this instantly with a relaxation of your abdominal muscles, allowing the diaphragm to descend down to your abdominal cavity, pulling with it your lungs. In this exercise, exhalation takes about one fourth the time of inhalation. The exhalation process is quick and strong while inhalation is passive and slow. Do this for 15 to 20 times twice each day, and add a few more exhalations each week as your lungs become stronger."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"46  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 24 -- Alternate Nostril Breathing For Mood Control Sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight, and close your right nostril with your thumb. Inhale slowly through the left nostril to the count of 5. Exhale through the same nostril to the count of 10. Exhalation time is always twice the inhalation time. Do this 15 to 20 times through the left nostril. Now close the left nostril with your right ring finger and little finger and inhale through the right nostril. Inhale to the count of 5 and exhale to the count of 10. Repeat 15 to 20 times. Do not make a sound during inhalation and exhale the air as much as possible from your lungs. There is no retention of the air in this exercise. Practice this exercise two times a day for 15 days, then increase the proportion time to 6 seconds for inhalation and 12 seconds for exhalation. Do this twice a day for another 30 days and you'll notice your low, mid and high breathing automatically improving. Your tension and stress in life will sharply lessen as well. You can vary this exercise by visualizing the incoming air having an energizing color of your own choosing. Put your conscious awareness into each breath, and see and feel the air as you draw it into your lungs. Breathing through different sides of the nose affects a person's behavior. We normally alternate nostrils every 1 to 4 hours. The older the breather, the longer the duration of the cycle. When you lie on your side, your lower nostril congests while the upper one opens. Also, if there is pressure on one armpit, the nostril on the other side will open. Research has revealed that certain stress-related diseases occur when the right nostril is blocked. When the nasal obstruction is corrected, stress is relieved. Left nostril blockages don't cause the same problems. There is also some evi- dence to indicate that breathing through one nostril stimulates activity in the opposite side of the brain. By determining which nostril you're using the most at any given time, you can tell which side of the brain you're activating the most. By forcing a switch in your nostril breathing, you can also shift into the hemisphere you want to utilize as well. Sometimes to alter an unwanted state of mind, you can just breathe through your congested nostril 15 to 20 times."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  47 Exercise 25 -- Better Breathing, B etter Emotions There is a difference between breathing for bare survival and breathing for optimal usage of every breath. Lungs hold about 6 pints of air, but desk workers usually inhale only about a pint. Therefore five sixths of your lung capacity lies idle. Learning how to breathe properly gives you more energy, allows you to sleep better, wake up faster and suffer from less fatigue. Once you train yourself to breathe the right way, it becomes automatic. If you smoke, you even begin smoking less or not at all. Retention of your breath develops control, and slow exhalations relax body tissues to prevent your energy from becoming a form of tension. Your body sometimes automatically relieves tension by releasing the breath in the form of a sigh or a groan. In this exercise, begin by breathing in to the count of 4 and out to the count of 12. Do this sequence 10 times a day, over a 2 week span of time, and gradually increase the count until you are able to breathe in to the count of 7 seconds and out for the count of 21 seconds. Always do each sequence 10 times. Next, inhale slowly to the count of 4, hold it for the count of 16 and exhale slowly to the count of 8. When counting in this exercise, you might repeat, \"Peace, Peace, Peace\" or \"Calm, Calm, Calm,\" for added relaxation. You can also mentally repeat the mantra, \"AUM\" over and over while you breathe. Next, increase the count ratio to 8:32:16, and then to 16:64:32. Always master one sequence comfortably before progressing to the next. By holding your breath, nervous feelings can often be reduced as you auto- matically tend to do in times of stress. By diaphragmatic, rhythmic breathing, regulation of the autonomic functions is more easily controlled. Emotional changes and shifts in moods are kept in check. Susceptibility to disease is lessened with a higher oxygen assimilation, and many startling, mental feats are easily achieved. Because of gravity, blood within the lungs favors the lower areas. Therefore when air is drawn into those areas, a more efficient mixing of blood and oxygen is achieved. Studies reveal that diaphragmatic muscles and the nerves governing their move- ment can produce relatively strong muscular electricity, the intensity of which varies with one's power of thought. Use of the body's bioelectricity is developed in some martial artists to such a high level that a powerful charge of energy can be delivered to an enemy from up to 10 feet away without touching him (see \"Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness\")!"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"48  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 26 -- Rhythmic Breathing To  Har monize Body/Mind Processes Rhythmic breath control slows down body and mind rhythms and helps to resynchronize out-of-synch body/mind processes. To begin this exercise, relax in a chair or lie down on a couch or bed and close your eyes. Take in a slow, deep breath of as much air as you can hold. Now exhale slowly, but completely. Inhale 10 deep abdominal breaths and each time exhale slowly by pulling your abdomen in. Now make your breathing rhythmic. Inhale to the count of 4; hold it to the count of 4; exhale to the count of 4; and pause to the count of 4. Repeat 3 cadences of this rhythmic pattern. Now relax. Next, inhale to the count of 6; hold it to the count of 6; exhale to the count of 6; and pause to the count of 6. Repeat this process 3 times. Now do the same thing to a count of 8. Repeat that 3 times. Do this series daily. Another variation of this exercise is to do as above, but synchronize the counts of your breaths to the beats of your pulse.

Autogenic training consists of a series of 6 exercises which are outlined in the following pages. To achieve optimal results with this suggestive conditioning exercise, wait at least an hour and a half after eating a meal, then assume a comfortable sitting or lying down position. Relax all your muscles from your toes to your head and take deep, abdominal breaths. Breathe slowly, and exhale for twice as long as you inhale. For example, inhale to the count of 3 and exhale to the count of 6. Do this series 3 times; then inhale to the count of 4 and exhale to the count of 8. Do this 3 times; then inhale to the count of 5 and exhale to the count of 10. Repeat 3 times; then go in reverse. Breathe in for 5 beats and out for 10 beats; then in 4 and out 8; then in 3 and out 6. Each time repeat the sequence 3 times. This is your \"warm-up.\" Now silently repeat to yourself the following “limb heaviness” (relaxation) affirmations: Say, \"My right arm is getting heavy,\" 6 to 8 times; then say, \"My right arm is getting heavier and heavier,\" 6 to 8 times; then reiterate, \"My right arm is completely heavy,\" 6 to 8 times; visualize its heaviness like lead; then say, \"I feel perfectly calm,\" 3 times. Then open your eyes and throw away the heaviness. Flex your arm and breathe deeply. Now begin the cycle again, including the warm-up. Spend 10 to 15 minutes each time and do this 2 or 3 times per day. To intensify the effect, visualize yourself in a peaceful, background setting, and actually imagine your arm getting heavier. Don't try too hard; just relax and let it happen. Do the exercise with your right arm for 3 days. Then using the same formula, do the same exercise with your left arm for 3 days. Then do it with both arms together for 3 days. Then do the right leg for 3 days; then do your left leg for 3 days; then do both legs together for 3 days; and finally do both arms and legs together for 3 days. Thus, the heaviness exercise takes 21 days. If you achieve genuine heaviness sooner, move along faster, but be thorough. If you continue to practice, results will be yours. Belief has little to do with the process; practice alone is important. What you are achieving here is a consciously directed altered state of awareness, similar to self-hypnosis. With continued practice, you will get use to producing a physical response by simply suggesting it. After mastering this conditioning exercise, you will be able to bring about this adjusted state in yourself in less than a minute, and under any circumstances."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"50  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 28 -- Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control  (Limb Warming) To demonstrate the suggestibility factor in the mind/body relationship, have an unknowing partner agree to a tolerance to pain test with his back turned towards you. Tell him that you want to momentarily touch his back with a lit cigarette to illustrate his control over pain. Instead, touch his back with a piece of ice of similar diameter sheathed in a cloth (to prevent water drips) and watch a redness develop on his back. This mind/body reaction to the expectation of a suggested result is the basis for many similar hypnotic 'feats' as well. A utogenic training allows you to achieve a suggestive state of mind using con- sciously directed affirmations. Once you learn how to interrupt your automatic bodily controls with your conscious mind, you can direct your body to shed excess fat from specific areas, maintain profuse hair growth in balding spots, and heal and repair damaged or diseased cells. In fact, you’ll find your body will easily fulfill your conscious suggestions once you learn how to direct it. Each autogenic exercise in autonomic control should be mastered before moving on to the next in sequence. Right now do one cycle for limb heaviness of the arms and legs. It should take you less than a minute. Once heaviness is established, begin the exercise for warmth. Say to yourself, \"My right arm is getting limp and warm,\" 6 to 8 times. Then repeat, \"My right arm is getting warmer and warmer,\" 6 to 8 times. Then say, \"My right arm is completely warm,\" 6 to 8 times. Then say, \"I am feeling completely calm.\" Using your imagination, actually feel your arm getting warm. Remember a time in the sun when it really was warm or actually go into the sun and remind yourself how it feels. Actually sustaining your conscious awareness in a certain body area will automatically bring a blood flow to that body area and an ac- companying warmth at the same time, so you should master this exercise quite easily. Repeat the procedure 2 to 3 times a day for 3 days. Then do the left arm, both arms, right leg, left leg, both legs and then both arms and legs for 3 days on each sequence. Then sum up the first two exercises in a combined fashion. Say, \"My arms and legs are getting limp and heavy and warm,\" 6 to 8 times. Then repeat, \"My arms and legs are getting heavier and warmer,\" 6 to 8 times. Then say, \"I feel completely calm.\" Always before repeating a cycle, open your eyes and throw off the heaviness and warmth. Then repeat the process again.

Laboratory investigations have shown that muscle response, blood flow, skin temperature, brain waves, metabolism and blood chemistry shift in the direction of a relaxed state during practice, and abnormal conditions move slowly toward normalcy with continued practice. Actually, many emotional problems are also relieved with autogenic training, and these techniques are widely used in Europe to help people along these lines!

Each of the exer- cises must be learned before proceeding to the next in sequence. Unlike yoga, autogenic training does not involve difficult postures or breath control exercises. There is no equipment and there is little time actually devoted to practice (5 to 10 minutes 3 times per day). Yet learning this ingenious combination of suggestion and conditioning will enable you to bring about deep therapeutic relaxation under stress automatically. With just a thought, you can relax any part of your body at any given moment during your day. To begin this exercise, start with the \"warm-up\" of \"Exercise -- Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness).\" Now repeat the short form of the heavy to warm formula and then the heart, breathing and abdominal formulas. Now say, \"My forehead is cool,\" 6 to 8 times. Then repeat to yourself, \"I feel completely calm,\" one time. W ith this exercise, imagine a cool breeze blowing across your forehead. To get the right feeling, actually stand in front of a fan to see how it feels at first. Then afterwards visualize the same feeling in your mind, but don't focus your conscious awareness on your forehead or you will bring about a warm blood flow into the area. Repeat this suggestive conditioning for 10 minutes at a time, 3 times a day for 2 weeks. When you experience a definite coolness on the forehead, you've mastered it. Upon terminating a session, open your eyes and begin to move gradually by flexing and stretching your muscles to throw off the heavy feeling. To mai ntain facility in doing these autogenic training exercises, practice at least once each day using these techniques in your daily life. Invent your own techniques revolving around the same suggestive principles. Remember, practice is the key, and you can get good at anything through practice."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  55 Exercise 33 -- Consciously Creating Your Emotions A depressed person can look at a smiling face and see a snarl. A person in love can see beauty where others see ugliness. Obviously, a person’s emotions affect their perceptions. Many people are spontaneously beset with fears, worries and self- doubts throughout their life, but how do you control the display of these kinds of emotional episodes? Sometimes people are even confused in their minds as to what emotion they really do want at the moment or even knowing the difference between one emotion and another or even knowing they have the conscious power to choose a particular emotion! Consequently they mix up lust and love, pleasure and happiness or fear and courage. So before attempting this exercise, master “Exercise -- Identifying Your Emotional States.” As an exercise in creating happiness, let us first define happiness. Although some people refer to happiness as relating to a single or a series of pleasurable sensations, let’s broaden the definition somewhat. Let’s relate it to a feeling of well-being, peace, comfort, prosperity, contentment, satisfaction, fulfillment, enjoyment and seeing beauty around you. When you feel happiness in this way, you look at everyone else as beautiful, complete beings, regardless of how they look at themselves or the rest of the world. To extend the definition of courage beyond a simple bravado to disguise your fear, look at courage as an emotion where you are facing danger and difficulties with firmness, resolution and a determination to achieve your aim. See courage as a persistence and tenacity which keeps you going in the face of opposition, regardless of what others might say about you. True courage is akin to faith. By embracing and tempering your fear, you remain undaunted and unwilling to acknowledge defeat. To understand pure agape love, you must go far beyond lust and apprehend the emotion of love in an unconditional way, without the thought of any return of your love. Love in this way is tender, gentle, kind and non-attached, without strings. It’s a love towards people that allows them to be who they are. Compassion is a caring about others with great feeling, pity and sympathy for their condition or particular predicament in life. A sympathetic desire to help others less fortunate is elicited because you empathize with their distress or misfortune. For an exercise in creating happiness, let’s assume a comfortable, relaxed position (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Take a few deep, abdominal breaths with your eyes closed. Relax all parts of your body progressively from your toes to your head. Use an environment record or tape of a seashore, coun-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"56  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT try scene or other calming background music and play it while visualizing to yourself how you would look in a happy scene. Put animals or happy people playing in your scene. Bring all your senses into play. Smell and taste the air. Feel the warmth of the sun and the sand or grass under your feet. See and hear colors and moving action in your happy visualization. Doing this exercise periodically will definitely bring about relief to your negative thought patterns, and you will create a desire to put more relaxation into your life as well. As a variation of the above exercise, first write a list of all the happiest moments in your past that you can remember. Take your time and go over your whole life in thorough detail. Write your happiest moments down in one sentence descriptions. Now pick a few of these moments, and reexperience them again inwardly. What do you think caused your happiness? Call all your senses into play -- see it, hear it, feel it, smell it and maybe even taste it. Kinesthetically pantomime the actions involving it. Smile and laugh to yourself. You'll find that if you had any problems before starting this exercise, they'll definitely be minimized now. By visualizing a happy scene in your past just prior to a difficult meeting, you'll be delighted at the difference it makes in creating a favorable atmosphere. Now do the same exercises above and substitute happiness for courage, love and compassion as the emotion you want to practice creating, taking each one in turn. As a continuance to the above drill in creating your emotions, visualize something that will well up fear in your mind, then create courage to embrace your fear. Create anger, then its counterpart - compassion. Create a purely pleasurable episode in your mind, then create the longer lasting emotion of happiness to allow yourself to distinguish the difference between the two emotions. Create a lustful event in your mind, then embrace it with pure, unconditional love and notice the difference. One way to begin controlling and creating better emotions is by controlling the idle thoughts and images you begin to replay in your mind throughout the day. In order to practice the emotions of pure love, compassion, courage and happiness, take a moment every day and create an image or a series of images that can evoke each emotion you want to experience. Think first of someone you truly love or have loved. Hold the image in your mind for a moment, then think of someone you have or had compassion for, and do the same thing. Then think of a really happy moment in your life or several happy moments, and experience those images for while. Finally create an image of a time when you exhibited courage in your life, and hold that image for a while in your mind. Practice this exercise often to get better at creating more favorable emotions for yourself."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  57 Exercise 34 -- Polarize Your Energy With Breathing By methodically and rhythmically breathing in oxygen, the mind and body are charged with energy. By visualizing a positive energy flow as you inhale and a negative energy flow as you exhale, worries and anxieties can be dissipated from your mind. When performing this polarization exercise correctly, a tingling sensation is often felt with each breath. To begin this exercise, lie down on a couch or bed with your feet pointing south and your head north to align yourself with the earth's magnetic field. Assume a comfortable, relaxed position with your hands touching the sides of your body, palms up. Begin breathing through your nose with slow, deep, abdominal breaths. As you inhale, visualize warm, bright yellow sun energy drawing through the top of your head, surging through your body and exiting through the soles of your feet. Imagine this yellow sun energy as a positive current. Now slowly exhale and visualize cool, blue moon energy being drawn up through the bottom of your feet, pulsing through your body, and exiting through the top of your head. Imagine this blue moon energy as a negative current. Synchronize this visualization of the inhaling yellow and exhaling blue with the breathing process, and experience a sensing of vibration internally. This will not only improve your concentration abilities, but it will also charge up your body in preparation for any new tasks of the day."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"58  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 35 -- Changing Your Emotion Via Visualization N egative and positive emotions are simply states of mind. Change your state of mind and you change the emotion. Wallowing in negative emotional states can be habit forming for some people, so this exercise will trick the negative, emotional part of the brain into relinquishing its hold. Why? Because first we're going to increase the amount of that negative emotion so that you can wallow temporarily in more of it. This exercise will also work on headaches or certain types of specific pain as well. Now lie down and relax yourself completely starting from your toes and working up to your head. Focus on deep, abdominal breathing and get comfortably relaxed. Now visualize a bright, yellow weather balloon in front of you, about 5 feet in diameter. Picture it growing bigger and bigger until it fills the room. Now visualize the balloon shrinking and shrinking down to the 5-foot size again. Increase its size and shrink it back again 2 more times. Now go through the same imaging process, but this time with your negative emo- tion or pain contained inside the balloon. Increase its size and feel the emotion or pain growing as you do this. Now decrease its size suddenly by punching a small hole in the side of the balloon, and envision the negative emotion or pain leaving the balloon as it completely deflates down to just an empty bright yellow balloon. Bright yellow is an uplifting color, and often has startling positive effects. You can also keep a yellow piece of construction paper (3\" X 5\") in your wallet or pocketbook to use as a pick-me-up during the day by just pulling it out and concentrating on it momentarily."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  59 Exercise 36 -- Dealing With Shame, Guilt and Blame Many times people find themselves in life complaining about their lacks, speaking of being victims or generally expressing negative viewpoints towards themselves or the world. The more a person stays stuck in such a mental or emotional place, the more real such a state becomes in their personal world. Through the process of living, we all develop our own personal system of polarities, where something is good or bad, positive or negative, up or down. Changing negatives into positives is part of the developmental process of growing towards the higher good . When we react instead of consciously acting in our life, we often regret later that we could have done something in a better way. These past events often serve as anchors until you release and let go of any negative beliefs or memories of them. You may have had relationships in your past that you didn’t handle the best way that you could. There may be an old hurt, something said in anger or a feeling of being let down or letting someone else down that is lingering in your memory. As an exercise, go back and change these negative recollections by looking at the positive gifts that people had for you and see the good you did for them. Then transmit forgiveness and selfless love to those people at whatever age they were when you experienced them. You will heal yourself and others throughout this process. The healing will also take place in the present time, and will erase any projection of negative patterns in your future behavior. Always remember that had it not been for those past events, you would not be who you are in the present! Keep in mind that every time you replay the words or imagery of a guilty action, it is like reliving the error again. The act of asking for forgiveness and transmitting forgiveness must also be coupled with forgiving yourself. No matter how terrible the act, there is no purpose served in self-accusation and reminding yourself of failure. Simply acknowledge the guilty action, forgive yourself for it and get on with your growth without beating yourself up any longer. You can’t change what has already happened, but your choices in the future can now be more directed. You must begin living in the here and now . Make the present perfect. Do not expend your energy dwelling on what you should've, could've, might've done in the past. The present is a gift, enjoy it! As another gentle exercise, step outside yourself and time, and view your entire life path as a whole picture rather than as a series of unconnected events. This higher perspective negates the tendency to blame or condemn yourself for isolated events in your life that you think you could have done better or differently. If you think about"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"60  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT it, those very incidents that you consider distasteful provided you with the growth that allows you now to see a better way of behaving. You can see why you drew certain incidents into your life and what you learned from them. You can see why you did not get what you thought you wanted. Perhaps not having a certain thing changed your life path, or maybe having it would have held you back in some way. Now you can see how past experiences have served you. You now know how to move into that larger perspective and handle your energy expression in a better way. You can even let go of the belief that growth always comes through pain and struggle. For instance, when you hate something in your past, you are still bound to it. When you see the big picture and love and understand each incident, you are freed from the ties of such incidents. When you can think of your childhood and your parents, and know that they were perfect for your growth, you are freed from the effects of those early events in your life. Now you can realize that your childhood, your relationships and your careers have all made you what you are now. Do these simple exercises often, because they are all realizations to change negative memories into a positive understanding of where you are now and where you are progressing in your future. Here are some simple axioms to keep in mind. 1. If you don't want others to know about something you are about to do, then it is a signal to you that you are ashamed of doing it; so don’t do it! 2. Set your own values according to what you believe, not someone else’s belief system. Make your own choices and take full responsibility for them. 3. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes. A person who doesn’t make mistakes is not learning or doing anything. Be a mover through the world. Make mistakes, learn from them and move through them. 4. Integrate yourself, be honest and true to yourself in all settings. Do not live different lives, or be different people, in different settings. This leads to confusion in the mind. 5. If you still have any doubts about whether or not you should do something, ask yourself if this is the behavior you would want your grandchildren to know you by. If the answer is no, then don’t do it."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  61 Exercise 37 -- Swaying A Group Your Way Mob psychology or gang thinking simply refers to the suggestibility at work in a group. One person coughs in a concert audience and soon others chime in. Lynch mobs or groups that panic when someone yells fire are other examples. It’s like a simple entrainment of mentalities on a basic, unconscious level. To influence a group on a conscious level and sway them in your direction, consciously create the thought that all the people that hear you will be receptive to you and your ideas. Continue mindfully to recharge that idea when addressing a group. With this thought-form in mind, you have consciously created intention and you have moved in a committed way towards achieving a desired result. To achieve whatever positive goal you want with a group of people, do the fol- lowing exercise: 1) Find a mutual area of agreement with everyone. 2) Cease any bickering by having the people confirm what they agree upon. 3) Start the people discussing the benefits they are seeking. 4) Every time there is progress toward your goal, have it confirmed by the group. 5) Offer several variations of your idea so that the group can discuss which variation to use, rather than whether or not to choose your idea at all. 6) Finalize the decision with action and get the show on the road. Practice this exercise when you want to influence an audience, a group or a crowd. Remember, if you act out your role as a convincing actor, people will believe you and eventually the role will feel comfortable for you to sustain as an altered behavioral pattern. Understand that every thought you have has an effect in some way. The clearer your intention and the more committed your action toward your intended goal, the easier and the faster you will achieve your goal. You can choose to move through life in an unconscious, unmindful way or you can choose to move through life in a conscious, mindful way."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"62  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 38 -- Swaying A Person Your Way Nobody does anything in this world that he doesn't want to do. In swaying a person your way, the point is NOT to get someone to do something against his will, but instead to get him to WANT to do it. In this way, no resentment is built up and respect and cooperation are your rewards. As a daily exercise, apply the following techniques to deal more successfully with people: 1) Get the other person talking about himself, family or possessions. 2) Put the other person in a yes saying mood by giving him a lot of other things he can say yes to first. 3) Give the other person a feeling of importance by seeking their advice. 4) Get the other person thinking about how the job can be done, so it removes any question in his mind as to whether it should be done. 5) Give the other person a choice between 2 alternatives, both of which lead to your goal. 6) Arrange it so that the person will benefit highly by changing to your position. 7) Always express appreciation and thankfulness to the people that have impressed you with their contribution. 8) Smile and use the appropriate body language (see \"Exercise -- Discerning Body Language\") that announces that you like the other person. 9) Imagine the other person is the ideal companion for you and that you like him tremendously (even if you thought you disliked him). When you assume this feeling, you will undergo outward personality changes that the person will notice and be affected by. If he doesn't like you initially, he will soon be doing so. What do women find most appealing in men? Is it good looks, muscles, a macho attitude or money? -- maybe, but most of all, it's self-assurance. When a man is self- confident, he is comfortable with himself and relaxed around women. His eyes don't dart around to every pretty lass that passes by. To get a woman to think you're sexy, exude self-confidence; then swaying a woman your way will be no problem. If you want to turn women away, act insecure or unsure of yourself. Also, since laughing releases endorphins in the brain, making a woman laugh relaxes any tenseness she has and she feels more at ease with you. CAUTION: To act with an air of self-assurance to harmfully influence women is not the point of this instruction. All mannerisms should be genuinely expressed and never as a façade for insecurity. If you are already self-confident, display it. If you"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  63 are not, aspire to achieve it. To sway a man your way, a woman need only appeal to his macho attitude in some way. Very few men are centered enough to withstand an appeal to their male egos. In one way or another, if a woman tells a man that he is the best and most fantastic person (or lover) she has ever met, she will have him eating out of the palm of her hand. Female spies, prostitutes and manipulative women have often used this tactic over the centuries to their advantage. CAUTION: Again, it is not the point of this exercise for you to be disingenuous. To grow and allow heart felt personality changes to manifest is far preferable to producing them in a phony way. To convert an enemy to act as your friend, practice visualizing your enemy acting like your best friend. When next you meet, treat him as you would your best friend by acting out the role. His attitude has to change in response, and he will probably find himself liking you against his initial inclination! Treat everybody as a potential friend and they have to respond."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"64  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 39 -- Boost A Person’s Sense Of Importance With many people, there is a distinct need to feel important. Without this feeling fulfilled, a person often suffers from self-doubt, guilt, insecurity and low self-worth. Those same people will go to great lengths to maintain a good reputation, or to demonstrate that they are needed, or to gain a bit of self-esteem, or to prove their superiority, or to show that they're right, or even to meet a challenge presented to them. If you diplomatically satisfy these areas to such ego-oriented people, you become master over any situation with them. Their emotional mind loves it, and their logical mind is suspended. As a daily exercise, exhibit a little thought when you handle your next people situation, and see how well it works. For example: To a boss that normally reprimands you: \"If it wasn't for your astute judgment, the efficiency of the company certainly wouldn't be as high. It sure is fortunate that you keep everyone on their toes.\" To a lover or spouse going through a bout of negativity: \"You're the best example I know of someone doing the best he can in any situation. Therefore I know that whatever decision you make, it'll be a good one.\" As a further exercise, work with a friend and alternate with each other on skillful, ego-boosting remarks based on the principles outlined above.

Rarely do people argue logically. They usually argue emotionally and later they often regret it. When this happens, take advantage of it.

First learn what not to do in an argument: 1) Don't force your will on another person. 2) Don't tell the other person he is wrong. 3) Don't order the other person to shut up and listen. 4) Don't dazzle the other person with your brilliance. 5) Don't seek someone else to side with you against the other person. Instead, do this: 1) State your viewpoint in a calm and moderate manner. 2) Assume a non-arrogant stance to disarm the other person. 3) Express a note of doubt about your own viewpoint by admitting that you might be mistaken. This halts the other person's blind opposition to your viewpoint. 4) Since you're not jamming your opinion down the other person's throat, he is now willing to see your position. 5) He now looks at your opinion rationally and begins to see the truth in it. 6) And finally, after having saved face, he argues your side of the case and shows you how your doubts are unwarranted.

It just takes practice."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"66  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 41 -- Skillful People Handling Even though change is constant in the universe, and people are changing constantly every day, there is nevertheless a dogged determination by most people to resist the idea of change. Many good ideas are representative of change, and often take a great deal of time to become accepted. When Louis Pasteur connected germs to infection in 1862, it was a concept that was slow to be accepted by medical men. Consequently, when James A. Garfield (U.S. 20th President) was shot in 1881, he died of septic poisoning from U.S. doctors probing for the assassin’s bullet with unsterilized instruments! W hatever you think about and talk about will grow. Realize the power of your words and even your thoughts about others. You can greatly assist people by not emphasizing in your words or thoughts their weaknesses, but instead emphasize positive, successful working patterns you might want to establish - as if they were already established. People will respond by moving in the direction you emphasize. Instead of criticizing mistakes, praise whatever good or productive points they made. If you are introducing an idea or viewpoint that is representative of a drastic change, then make the idea seem like it originated with whatever opposers there are to it. Start out by saying, \"Your idea the other day was a good one,\" or \"You're right, I think your method is correct,\" or in a group situation, \"To summarize what everyone has said ... \" Then proceed with your own idea. If you want someone to adopt your method, say something to congratulate the person as if he had already adopted it. His basking in the praise will prevent him from denying the fact that he has done it, and he will immediately adopt your methodology to fulfill the credit given to him. To impress people with your discernment, refrain from complimenting them on something they are already proud of. Look for something unusual or unexpected in their personality, home or possessions and create a skillful compliment. You can side step the need to control, judge or dominate others altogether by helping them to do or see something for themselves instead! This gives them a sense of empowerment. Rather than giving someone an order or instructing them on how to do something, try asking them, “What would it take to prove that you can do this for yourself?” Then say, “Let’s work together to see if we can make it happen.” The offer of your assistance, instead of just taking over or giving an order, will suffuse both of you with power.

What really matters is how the person receiving the criticism experiences it, not what the criticizer's intention is. A face to face emotional confrontation designed to rip you up one side and down the other can be handled simply by -- silence, a blank stare and no responsive gestures. The more your opponent tries to get you angered, the more frustrated he becomes, and soon he just shuts up. If he queries why you are not responding, just say, \"Would you?\" and revert back to the silent treatment. You'll have no more trouble from there. There is an energy emitted through your eyes (see \"Exercise -- Eye Contact For Inner Communication\"). An impassive, non-responsive stare jams or deflects the bombardment of the negative energy that the other person directs toward you. Refusing to swirl yourself into 'synch' with a negative energy display leaves the other person frustrated, bewildered and exhausted. To handle the behind-your-back criticizer, go to that person (without mentioning his criticism of you), and praise that person for the very thing that he is criticizing you about. Many times a person criticizes you for the very thing they dislike in themselves, like a mirror effect. By praising them on it, their insecurity is temporarily relieved and they no longer need to look at you so harshly. If they criticize you on the way you dress, praise them on the way they dress. If they criticize you on the way you talk, praise them on the way they talk, etc. Always remember that patient encouragement, guidance and support are far more helpful than delivering criticism to people. Don’t tell another person what to do, but let them tell you! Support a person where they are, and in whatever they decide to do. This is critical. Most individuals with suppressed emotions have them because of an experience, accident or other trauma and it wasn’t OK to express them at the time. They need the trust and security that they are in charge and that they are not being pushed into anything that they do not wish to do. They can stop when they have had enough, and they usually know when that time is. You can be with them at that time and tell them that it is all right.

Putting things off can become a habit that often involves fears, self-doubts and a low tolerance for the unpleasant. This could later lead to feelings of helplessness, alcoholism, depression or anxiety. Procrastination is not simply laziness, but a complex psychological problem. First you must observe yourself and realize when you are a procrastinator. Then figure out how and why you keep putting things off ... and off ... and off. Identify the fact that your so-called rational reasons for putting things off are nothing more than excuses. There are the little lies you tell yourself that are really expressions of inner turmoil of two basic types -- a fearful self-doubt and a \"discomfort dodging\" or a low tolerance for tension and frustration. If you're a procrastinator, first make a list of all the 'reasons' or excuses you use to put things off. People who say they don't have time are really saying they don't want to make the time. After making your list, carry it with you during the day as a reminder to monitor your own thoughts, and pay attention to those excuses as they occur. Next is action. Sometimes a project seems so large, it becomes discouraging to think about it, so a decision to start is never made. To correct this, practice little commitments of time toward it. Tell yourself to start the task and work on it for 5 or 10 minutes. At the end of that time period, you can commit yourself to another 5 or 10 minutes, and so on. By tricking your mind in this way, you at least make the first frightening step, and the rest gets easier. Every part of the task that you get out of the way is one less part that you have to deal with. Get in the habit of doing it now, when you think about it, rather than later. \"Don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today.\" Afterwards, reward yourself with a pleasant task. Remember every time you act instead of hesitate, it begins to change your attitude little by little into a more positive approach to many other aspects of your life. Don't be afraid of making mistakes, either. Those who don't make mistakes, don't attempt anything. Also, knock off a lot of little jobs first to get your motor started with a sense of task completion; then tackle small parts of the bigger jobs. Change your way of looking at a disagreeable chore to just \"something to do\" instead of something to like or dislike.

All these techniques will convert you into a self-actualizing doer and not a procrastinator. Also, don't forget to surround yourself with positive people, or otherwise old habit patterns can reestablish themselves if you allow other procrastinators around you to affect you. Here are some good points to remember: 1. Stop postponing your life! Define your goals and set priorities. What do you want? What do you need to do to achieve your goals? How long will they take? What is the deadline for each? 2. Get organized! Get clutter out of your life, for it can be a distraction. List your tasks in order of importance and put the distractions at the end of the list. Put a realistic deadline date on each item. 3. Divide large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Limit yourself to ONE task at a time to reduce frustration. Delegate if you can - get help if you need it. You don't have to struggle with this all by yourself. 4. Start somewhere! Determine what is the most important task on your list? Divide it up into mini tasks. Take ACTION! 5. Start small. Write down 2 or 3 mini tasks that you can accomplish in just 5 minutes. Do one of them NOW. Cross off the completed task and watch your to-do list shrink. How does it feel to complete a task? Reward yourself afterwards. 6. Schedule time. Allocate a specific amount of time to your tasks and STOP when that time is up. Start with just 5 minutes, then consider another 5 minutes at the end of the first. 7. Use reminders. Keep your tasks visible in front of you. Set up reminders, lists notes, etc. to prompt you into action. 8. Identify your best time. When are you most productive during the day? When do you have the most energy and feel really alert? Use this time for your most important tasks. Use other times during the day for more routine tasks. If you feel an impulse to work on a task, follow it up right now! When you have had enough, STOP. 9. Be accountable. Commit to complete each task by its deadline. Tell yourself or someone else when this will be. Hold yourself accountable for your actions. 10. Self-motivation. There's no time like the present. The sooner you complete a task, the sooner you can play. You don't have to do a task all by yourself.

Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, do it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.\"    ....... Goethe The ability to make life changing decisions is closely linked to overcoming procrastination. After completing \"Exercise -- Discourage Procrastination, Enhance Action,\" you can now proceed with this exercise. It was once said that living is not difficult, it’s the decisions in life that are difficult. People are creatures of habit or better still, people tend to do what they have practiced most in their life. Regardless of how uncomfortable or unhappy they are, people are loath to change what they are accustomed to having or operating with in their lives. The struggle people put forth as resistance to change creates a non-flowing condition. Acceptance and surrender creates the flowingness necessary to get what you want out of life. To an aggressive personality, this all seems illogical. Force is how he or she wants to control his or her life! Hence the opposite happens. They lose control and consequently feel fearfully helpless in the realities they have created for themselves. The tighter the grip you have in trying to make things happen, the more you fail to succeed. It’s the allowance of the process to work that creates what you want out of life. So patience, tolerance, forgiveness, generosity, gratitude, grace, kindness, gentleness, repentance, mercy, compassion, humility and unconditional love are all upper brain region states utilizing more cortical cells. This then is the link to our spiritual side that connects us to different concepts than the mundane, greedy, materialistic world. We live in a physical world, but our true selves are spiritual, so it is easy to lose our purpose for being here! When we exercise our upper brain regions in a complete way, more of the why becomes clear. Effective decision-making can also transform your negative, emotional attitudes into more positive states of mind. You also feel better about yourself in the process. You have free will to make decisions at any time you wish, but you must initiate the process."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"72  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Some people have great difficulty in deciding what they want to do with their lives. Making a decision to go to a restaurant or to take a vacation, anyone can make. But making a decision to change jobs, change lovers or spouses, change homes or make other meaningful life changes is not so easily managed by some people! As a result, people may sit on the fence of life - sometimes for months or even years in unhappy situations without moving in the direction that could make them happier with themselves. Stress often builds in such people, and physical and emotional health problems easily develop. How can you become more decisive? How can you make distinct life choices and proceed ahead with those choices? To begin, consciously review the life’s choices that you’ve already made, and see for yourself how you’ve created your own reality as it stands now! Look at your life and see how directly and how indirectly you’ve created the circumstances that have brought you to this point in your life. Write it down on paper and look at it. Our habitual behavior is simply a neurological pattern in the brain that you get accustomed to repeating, like a needle stuck on a record. You must consciously bump the needle off the groove in the record and allow yourself to explore the rest of the record. Consciously acknowledging that you are stuck on your “record” is the first step, but consciously bumping yourself off so you can explore the other grooves of your “record of life” is the second step. Some people never acknowledge they are stuck in their lives (step one), so consequently they never get to step two and they simply continue repeating the same things over and over in their lives, making very few major changes. Of course, you can sometimes acknowledge that you are unhappily stuck, but feel helpless about being able to make any changes to your stuckness! Fear of making a mistake or of being wrong can also contribute to your stuckness. So with step one, you must acknowledge that you are stuck in a certain pattern of behavior and that you want to be elsewhere. After all, you are either an active or an inactive participant in your own life, it’s your choice. What do you really want to do in your life? Can you see yourself happily doing this? What are the reasons you are not proceeding in this direction? Put these reasons down on paper. How can you go about changing your situation? Never once believe that you are helpless to change your life for the better. You’re always free to choose, and use your will power to go in any direction you want. Once you have decided on which direction you want to go, let go of it and simply proceed doing something every day in the direction you want to go. This commitment to a desired direction and “letting go” of it is an impor-"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  73 tant process, because it allows all of the unplanned and unforeseen events to happen to you as they assist you along the way. D ecision making requires practice like all other behavior. Remember, your life can be a continuous series of experiments to see what will work to give you a more favorable result or outcome. It’s when we feel trapped in experiencing unpleasant feelings during the process that we must consciously examine the way we behave (review “Exercise -- Making Better Choices & Getting Unstuck”). Practice diversifying your life and consciously embracing new experiences. If you catch yourself repeating a certain behavior in a certain way for 3 or more times in a row, change it! Get into a habit of doing routine things differently. Even brushing your teeth can be done with the left hand, in the kitchen, in a public bathroom or even outside with a canteen of water! Consciously and actively create change in your life. People can make a verbal decision to be one way or another, but they often find themselves doing something else. Some people get into a behavioral pattern of promising to do this or that and never follow through with what they said they would do. For some reason the saying of what they want to do relieves them temporarily of the doing of it?! They might have good intentions, but some block in their personality prevents them from completing a task or accomplishing a job they know needs to be done. The behavior of saying one thing and doing something else can certainly confuse you in your life. If you recognize this behavior in yourself, be mindful of it when it happens and “bite your tongue” before saying anything you are not really going to do. Learn to mean what you say and say what you mean for more clarity in your life. You’ll earn more respect from yourself and from others as well. Most of all, if you feel you have made a mistake with a particular choice, admit it, and make another choice. No big deal! If you never make mistakes, how can you learn? Continuing to make choices and experimenting with life is the best way to flow with life and keep unstuck!"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"74  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 45 -- Physical Tension Release Aside from identifying your various emotional states, can you identify your physical states? Naturally, you know when you are tired or when you are excited, but can you discern the level of your energy when the difference is not so extreme? You usually also know when you are sick, but can you discern the subtler changes in your physical health? Can you recognize any tension in the various parts of your body? As an exercise, begin identifying your current physical state to a partner. Then let your partner do the same with you. Now consciously scan your whole body while sitting in your chair. Describe to your partner any areas of physical tension, strain or poor posture. When you discover an area, stay in the area with your conscious atten- tion for a few minutes and describe any feelings that come to you while you are doing this. Now reverse the roles, and let your partner do the same thing. Since your per- sonality can change with a change in physical posture, being more mindful of how you sit, stand and walk during the day might also bring about more positive changes in the way you act. Even the way you hold your facial muscles affects your person- ality. Those suffering from multiple personalities often have different prescription glasses with each personality, because their facial muscles are held differently in each personality! Even smiling and laughing more can make a big difference. As an exercise when tense, tired or headachy and while standing or sitting, bend your knees slightly and place your hands high on your thighs. Draw your neck in like a turtle with the chin forward and up. A slight contraction will be felt at the base of your neck. Now draw your shoulders upward as if to touch them to your ears. Push down with the hands to draw the shoulders higher. If done correctly, a vibration will be felt in the neck, shoulders and head. Avoid breathing during the exercise and hold this vibration for a comfortable period. Then release and relax your muscles, beginning with the fingertips and working upwards. The vibration will release built-up tension and you may resume a more normal energy level. Tension, stress and even depression can be overcome by the following exercise: Place the shoulder blades as nearly together as you can without strain, then breathe out gently and fully. Pause, then inhale with a deep, slow, gentle breath until the lungs are comfortably filled. Breathe out slowly through the nose with a long sigh and without altering the position of the shoulder blades. Do this a dozen times and your tension should disappear. Why? Because you have just supplied the brain with positive, stimulating oxygen."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  75 Exercise 46 -- Listening With Better Attentiveness Sometimes people forget to listen to each people with any sincere interest. Good listening often replaces an egocentric need to impress someone with how much more special your story or accomplishments are than theirs. When someone is sharing their story with you, notice how their joy is minimized in telling it when you jump in with comments about yourself. This habit can quickly create distance between you and others. The next time you’re in a conversation with someone, try talking only about the other person for a change. Don’t talk about your own experiences and what you're reminded of, etc., but consciously notice your tendency to say something about yourself or your tendency to rebut what you just heard the other party say. Surrender this tendency to interject your comments, and just share in the other person’s joy in telling their story and see how much more fun and smiles they experience when they don't sense competition from you. A person cannot feel heard if you’re sharing your great idea about something. Only after the person has felt heard is it time to share your ideas and advice and then you’ll find they will listen to you much better too! You in turn will acquire a peaceful inner confidence that is derived from letting others have the spotlight and attention for a change. It's a magical feeling! As an exercise in listening, take turns with a partner so that one talks and the other listens for a full 10 minutes. As the listener, occasionally ask encouraging questions to reassure your partner of your interest or make positive comments like, \"Yes, I think so too\" or \"Can you tell me more\" or \"I see what you mean\" or “I want to hear the whole story,” etc. to your speaking partner. Make sure your facial and body language is also in accord with this affirmative tone. For instance, don't frown or grimace in disagreement while saying, \"Yes, I agree\" verbally. Mindfully put your body in the same postural position as the speaker's, modeling their head, body, arm and leg gestures identically. Do all of this with conscious definitude and sincerity. In fact, modeling a speaker’s voice tonality, eye contact, loudness, posture, word content and gesturing is a good way to establish comfort and acceptance in the other person without their noticing that you are modeling their behavior. Be endorsing and acknowledging, not placating and excessively excited. Don’t compete for the energy throughout the conversation. As a good listener, don’t get hung up on a speaker’s delivery - squeaky voice, occasional stutter, etc. for it tends to distract you from receiving the underlying message. You also must tune out distractions in the immediate environment that"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"76  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT could divert your attention from focusing on the speaker. Discipline yourself to maintain eye contact, lean forward in your chair and accept the speaker’s message without judging it as right or wrong. Doing this allows you to look for other clues, like body language and voice tonality. Are these clues consistent with what is being told to you? Is the message genuine or staged? As the speaker, talk for 10 minutes to your partner about something you feel strongly about -- abortion, quality education, pollution, war, peace, a lover, etc. People often need to discharge as an emotional release, so good listening allows this release to unfold. If you do not allow a person to talk to completion, they cannot discharge their discomfort or pain inside and it stays unfavorably bottled up. R eciprocation is also important, so after you both have had a chance to be the listener and speaker, compare the feelings you have concerning each other. Did you think your partner was listening with sincerity? Shutting your mouth also allows the listener to consciously tune into more levels than just words! You can even change your listening perspective. If you were listening for content, listen instead for any subtle emotions you pick up from the listener. What does the body language tell you about the person, and ask yourself what brought that person to their present state of mind!? The listener may even begin to feel accepted by you as you pick up on parts of them that they can’t articulate or even express openly. Being a good listener takes practice, but it’s worth the effort and can truly change your life."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  77 Exercise 47 -- Eye Contact For Inner Communication Just as microwaves can act as harmonically compatible carrier beams for extremely low frequency (ELF) wavelengths, focused eye beams can carry the emotional intentions of their transmitter. Couples in love can sometimes exchange complete emotional dialogues with one another through their eyes alone. Much of what you perceive through your eyes is a matter of interpretation in the brain. In \"Exercise -- Experiencing Another Person's Senses,\" you learned that other people often perceive things differently than you do. What you perceive can also be distorted by a telepathic message (see \"Exercise -- Visual Telepathy\"), or by the suggestive message of a hypnotist -- hence the fear of the 'hypnotic eye.' There is a strange energy that streams forth from your eyes. You can \"intuitively\" perceive it at times when someone with an emotional intention is staring at you. You instinctively look away because of it when you don't want to be noticed, or when you don't want your true thoughts to be known in a conversation. The so-called 'stage fright' of public speakers and would-be actors might have a lot to do with the sudden impact of everyone's eye beams carrying various thoughts that wallop a speaker into a subconscious stupor. This also often happens when you're introduced to someone and their eye beam meets yours, and their name never really gets registered and remembered properly. By consciously learning to screen out and adjust to this subliminal 'mental noise,' you gain more self-control in such situations. Because of this energy, it is said that ninja assassins used to look at their target victims with their peripheral vision so as not to give their position away. Electromagnetic energy radiates from your body, but a focalized form of ELF energy is guided by your eye beam (see \"Exercise -- Psionic and Psychotronic Generators\"). Psychokinetic demonstrations are greatly assisted by a concentrated stare from the eyes (see \"Exercise -- Psychokinesis\"). Benedetto Supino of Italy was reported to have the unusual ability of staring at paper, plastic or wooden objects, and causing such material to burst into flames! Unusual reports are sometimes heard of Chinese children with X-ray eyes, or others that can bend metal with a concentrated stare. Many people are fearful of prolonged eye contact with other people. Since thought transmissions through the eyes are a two-way street, fear often results when a person feels another person might be seeing into their mind to read through their external façade -- hence the expression, \"The eyes are the windows of the soul.\" In most social situations, each person has a length of time where eye contact feels com-"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"78  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT fortable. Anything beyond this period of time, it tends to become uncomfortable. Eye contact between two people usually varies anywhere from split seconds to about 10 seconds in duration. Listeners tend to maintain eye contact more than speakers. Listeners usually look away when they are about to speak, and speakers usually have a relatively prolonged gaze when they are about to finish speaking. Did you ever meet a strange barking dog only to have him back away when your eyes met his? Primate researchers have learned the same thing happens with wild monkeys. If you look briefly into their eyes, they won't hold their ground when you approach them. However if you carefully avoid eye contact, you can come within 5 feet of them. The next time you have a group gathered together, do the following experiment. Blindfold 2 people and have everyone else in the group only look at the face of one of the two people with some kind of emotional or intentional thought in mind. After about 1 minute of silence. Ask the 2 volunteers if they thought that they were the one being stared at, and what thought impressions did they have. Now relax and sit across from a partner. Begin by silently looking into each other's eyes. While in a relaxed frame of mind, look into his (her) right eye, then into the left eye. Extend your conscious awareness outside of yourself and \"touch\" the other person's mind through the pathway of his (her) eye beam. \"Listen\" with your intuition instead of your ears. Dispel any tension you might have over this, for this is only meant as a mutual and volitional exchange. Take note of any pictures, impressions, feelings or verbal messages that you perceive. Sometimes whole dialogues can be exchanged through a mutual perception in this way. Then after 2 minutes, check off the adjectives on the Adjectival Evaluation Sheet following this exercise that you think might be appropriate to your partner's personality. Also find out from your partner whether any strong impressions you picked up were really pertinent to your partner or not. As an added experiment, put on a pair of reflective sunglasses and observe the difference in eye contact this way. See if your partner can tell when you are focused on him (her), and when your eyes are shifted away from him (her). Afterwards, switch your roles. Rarely do people really get to know one another very well. Usually a lot of non- verbal communication can be felt by looking into someone's eyes. Any initial anger, fear or anxiety can quickly dissipate into peace and a relief-type relaxation with prolonged eye contact. With the tensions relieved, your energy is once again available for use. With practice, an understanding and oneness in the presence of other human beings can replace the fear and misunderstanding so often experienced."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  79 ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION SHEET Check off those words & phrases you feel are applicable to your partner: argumentative  shrewd  materialistic stuffy  diplomatic  vindictive insecure  confident  insensitive easily angered  jovial  trivial selfish  unselfish  aggressive timid  intelligence average friendly intelligence high  quick witted  talkative adventurous  cautious  patient impatient  erotic  contemplative intense  caring  giving submissive  deceptive  trustworthy untrustworthy  disciplined  undisciplined lazy minded  dangerous  materialistic peaceful  close-minded devious efficient  independent  critical childish  unstable  thoughtful boisterous  inquisitive  curious tolerant  intolerant  restrictive domineering  secure  dishonest honest  knowledgeable  skillful quick learner  interesting  agreeable intriguing  logical  illogical emotionally stable nervous  creative healthy  unhealthy  loving assertive  a leader type  understanding candid  fearful  stubborn frugal  wasteful  helpful sloppy  compassionate  sympathetic polite  open-minded  disagreeable If there are any words you feel you would like to add to the list for your description, please do so."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"80  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 48 -- Changing Emotions Via Odors The limbic system governs the primal urges of sex, hunger, anger, pleasure and fear; and olfactory impulses have direct pathways to this same center of the brain. Consequently, odors and primitive emotions have a closer association because of this link-up in the limbic system. In one experiment, human subjects were asked to complete a frustrating task as they were exposed to an unfamiliar odor. Later the same negative emotions associated with frustration occurred when exposed to that same odor. Scent manufacturers make millions of dollars each year by capitalizing on this connection in their attempt to emotionally get you to buy a particular product with a favorable odor -- from soaps to perfumes. For this exercise, purchase a bottle of already blended natural essence from your local natural food store that has an unusual or unfamiliar odor -- perhaps ambergris, civet, oak moss or myrrh. Now take it to a party or friend's house where you're likely to experience joy, laughter or some other pleasurable experience. At the optimal height of one of these good feelings, put a few drops of the essence on your arm and smell it frequently. In the future, to get out of a 'down' or negative mood, whip out your essence and begin smelling it again! You should become elated very quickly.

When the words become meaningless, there is nothing left in the con- sciousness except the monotonous sound-image, and that too then can disappear. Your name always catches your attention if mentioned in a crowd. Much of your identity is often bound up in your name. In this exercise, say your name the way you normally answer to it and repeat it aloud for a full 5 minutes. If your name is John Schofield and you are called Johnny, then repeat aloud Johnny Schofield softly to yourself. After a few moments, your first and last names will begin to run together in a blur of sound. Don't stop though; continue repeating your name aloud for 5 minutes. You may become disoriented after hearing your name reduced to a continual sound. Old remembrances of you as a child or infant will pop up. You also might find yourself externalizing and viewing yourself repeat your name as if you were outside the body. The exercise is directed toward an intuitive knowing that you are more than a name and identity, more than your body and physical brain, more than your job or daily role playing, more than your individual sex and even more than your mind. The poet, Tennyson, could spontaneously evoke mystical experiences with himself by the technique of repeating aloud his name over and over again."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"82  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 50 -- Managing Your Anger To manage anger in your life, you must first recognize what anger IS in your life. Here are some key words associated with anger that can help you identify it when it is present - irritation, resentment, impatience, vindictiveness, restriction, abusiveness, disagreement, loudness and hatred. Anger is one of the basic emotions that is said to stem from the limbic system in the brain. Oftentimes, childhood conditioning teaches us to suppress anger rather than to express it. On the other hand, you may have learned to express anger so frequently that it becomes uncontrollable rage in your life. Research studies have shown that anger increases your heart rate, boosts high blood pressure, encourages the clogging of your arteries with chloresterol and increases your overall risk of heart attack. If you deal with your anger by con- sciously recognizing and embracing it when it is happening, you don't have to allow it to rule your behavior in a blur of unconscious action. You allow the brain to shift its activity from the lower limbic system to the higher cerebral cortex. By being mindful and attentive to anger when you experience it, you can acquire conscious management of it while maintaining a better understanding of yourself. Through this process, you must keep yourself from self-criticism or self-judgment over your anger as to whether it is wrong or right. Just learn from each episode and consciously observe your anger for a better outcome each time you experience it. In searching for self-awareness, we are often drawn to the very people that mirror our innermost feelings. By using the events of our daily living as vital information, we begin to understand that all things that we're drawn to are simply aspects of ourselves. The more consciously honest you allow yourself to be, the less necessary it becomes to act out or unload anger upon others. Also, by accepting yourself the way you are, you no longer need to be stuck in the helplessness of anger or rage. Consciously validate to yourself that it’s OK to feel anger over something, but observe and understand it rather than act it out. When you do this, long suppressed memories may surface for examination and review. By writing down your feelings in a journal, you can further facilitate getting them out of your mind and away from unnecessary repression. Deep breathing, yelling, laughing, crying and even beating on pillows can all be helpful during this releasing process. The more you can contact and recognize what you are angry about at any given moment, the more alive, whole and empowered you can feel. Some people manage their anger better than others. Unmanaged anger can cause accidents, criminal incidents, nonproductivity, inefficiency and even physical disord-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  83 ers like high blood pressure, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, etc. The blood chemistry of an angry pregnant mother can even contribute harmful effects to her fe- tus. A newborn can also be adversely affected by the breast milk of an angry mother. To defuse rage in someone, ask the angered person an unrelated profound question that requires the cerebral formulation of an answer. By becoming con- sciously analytical, you are less likely to become embroiled in the anger yourself. Sometimes agreeing with an angry person lessens their hostility in your direction. Doing something wacky can sometimes help defuse the anger in a person. Some police departments train their officers to use this method quite frequently in domestic disputes. For example, an officer in the midst of a screaming couple might simply ignore them completely, and open up the couple’s refrigerator to start making a sandwich! Another officer might turn his cap around the wrong way and purposefully look silly at the hostile couple. As an exercise to defuse anger in yourself, consciously talk to yourself about your anger when you are feeling it. Direct yourself toward consciously thinking about your anger, and it will help you to calm down while allowing the conversation with yourself to move gradually to a more rational tone. Listen to and observe yourself. The moment you feel you're about to lose control, your rational mind can signal you that you're on the verge of doing or saying something that you'll later wish you hadn't. If something or someone is triggering your anger, begin con- sciously thinking of all the options you have available to you to deal with the situation instead of getting angry. Shout to yourself, and command “Get out of me ANGER!” When harboring ill feelings towards someone, visualize embracing them in your arms and transmitting love or warmth to them. When feeling angry over some seemingly uncontrollable situation, visualize being embraced in the arms of Jesus or God. Physically exercise, take a hot shower or bath, relax with a slap stick video or simply project forgiveness towards the source of your anger. Decide on an alternative course of action and take it. Remember, when you harbor anger or hatred toward someone, you're the one that suffers from its outcome. The positive complement to anger is compassion. As an exercise, the next time you feel anger or resentment toward someone, consciously catch yourself and direct compassion towards them instead. Anger dissipates in the conscious face of com- passion. To practice this transforming feeling, roll over in your mind the last several times you were angry with people and imagine feeling compassion for each person instead of anger as you replay each episode. Remember you're only as helpless about a display of anger as you think that you are."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"84  EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT Exercise 51 -- Journal Writing For Emotional Calming W riting in a journal has many advantages. It can clarify your goals and sharpen your thoughts each day about what is important to you and what you really want out of life. Your self-worth is enhanced as you note your daily achievements and joys of life. Problems also seem minimized when they are written down on paper. You will learn to express your feelings better, and when you learn to express your feelings, you strengthen your relationships. Journaling can also be a form of meditation. It can quiet your mind and focus your thoughts. It can reduce your anxiety, cheer you up and make you smile. Did you ever write a letter in anger to someone, but wind up not sending it? Whether you did or didn't send it, it still gave you a form of relief in writing out on paper your feelings, didn't it? Studies have revealed that people that write in personal diaries or journals recover faster from personal tragedies and stressful events. It makes you feel good to put your innermost thoughts on paper. In doing so, it has a cathartic effect on your psyche because you've expressed yourself outwardly and no longer have your feelings bottled up. When your thoughts are viewed on paper, they seem more manageable. Many people have emotional difficulties in life because they simply have not bothered getting in touch with their emotions. It's like the old saying, \"Before all else, to thine own self be true; know thyself.\" In fact, repressing your feelings is one of the leading causes of mental illness. Many times, friends, taxi drivers and psychiatrists serve the purpose of acting as a sounding board, and thereby allowing you to get in touch with the feelings that are troubling you. Keeping a journal will help you know yourself better and thereafter express yourself more clearly. As an exercise, experiment for yourself with journal writing. If you have a perplexing life situation, express yourself and write your feelings out on paper or in a journal. Describe the emotions you can identify. Oftentimes, greater clarity can be yours as to what to do next when you write about your emotional troubles in a journal. Another exercise in emotional coping can be writing down an overview of your life story or a brief autobiography of yourself. You might begin by writing about whatever memorable words and phrases you can remember from your childhood.

When two or more people do this in an honest and reciprocal way, a broader picture is often afforded to all concerned. Self- acceptance, self-worth and self-confidence is more easily embraced. A further exercise in journal writing is to keep yourself focused on your goals in life. This often entails an awareness of your daily states of mind that may be blocking you each day. By writing down on a daily basis your progress toward spe- cific goals, you can keep yourself on target and see where stuck conditions or reactive emotions are keeping you from achieving your goals.

Thought is the crystalline predecessor to reality. The expression \"seeing is believing\" is applicable to visualization. To truly see the thing you want to do, become or accomplish is part of the process of believing it. If you can't really see it happen in your life, how can you believe it can happen? Thought and desire normally precede action and accomplishment, but oftentimes, people say and think about doing one thing, only to NOT follow through with it or wind up doing something else. Mental confusion often results; truth and fiction get muddled; and absurd excuses are made for any conflicting behavior that follows. Researchers at the University of Texas, San Antonio monitored the brain activity of various subjects as they performed various body motions and also as they visualized doing those same body movements. They discovered that imagining a body movement involved the same areas of the brain as doing the actual movement -- with the exception of the motor cortex, which actually directs the muscles that produce the movement. In other words, mentally visualizing an action ahead of time gives your brain almost the same neural workout as doing the real thing. Whatever you want to accomplish as a skill or activity, visualize each step of it first, and this will prepare you for peak performance as you mentally walk through the successful strategies and potential pitfalls. As an exercise to make the connection between thought & action stronger, proceed through a normal day, and visualize your daily actions a split second before doing them -- brushing your teeth, unlocking doors, reading, walking or whatever. After getting good at this, visualize each action simultaneously while DOING the action! Then finally, visualize your actions a split second after doing them for better recall later. Practice this exercise often, and it will bring amplitude, conscious control and clarity to your daily actions and any new skills you are learning. M any times we subconsciously play in the background of our conscious mind unfavorable events or emotions that subtly cause us stress or unnecessary anger and fear throughout our normal day. Continually replaying these thoughts, even on a subconscious level, can contribute greatly toward our outward manifestations and daily actions.

When you catch yourself replaying a negative, inner"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88  INNOVATIVE THINKING movie, interject your positive visualization and play it instead. You get good at what you practice, and you can consciously choose to practice thinking whatever thoughts you want, whether they are negative or positive. There is a life energy flowing and ebbing in each one of us, and our immune system is directly linked to this life energy stream. Your strength does not solely rely on the size of your muscles. There are many environmental factors that can vitalize or devitalize your body on subtle levels. With certain people, some factors carry more weight than others in their effect, hence the variability from individual to individual. An accumulation of negative influences weakens your immune system, leaving you more susceptible to disease and overall emotional upset. But there is no need for you to go through life lacking energy and in a negative, mental slump. By being cognizant of what environmental factors de-energize you, you can avoid or at least mentally override such factors when they're recognized. If you are caught in an environment beset with de-energizing factors (fluorescent lighting, improper foods, raucous sounds, etc.), just visualize an energizing thought (picture, sound or feeling) to re-energize & strengthen yourself again. Your real essence inside your physical body is fully integrated within every one of your bodily cells, whether they are diseased or healthy. This knowledge gives you complete dominion over how those cells operate, so that consciously directed health can always be yours. If you choose to shield yourself from the debilitating effects of negative input, you can create a protective word or visual image to act as your anchor to do so. For instance, you might reiterate to yourself the word, \"strong,\" while stepping into a visual image of yourself BEING strong. The higher your life energy, the more protection you will have from negative factors. By raising your own life energy, you correspondingly help to raise the energy of those around you as well."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"  INNOVATIVE THINKING  89 Exercise 53 -- Image-Streaming One visualization process devised by Win Wenger, Ph.D. is called image- streaming. It involves a method of drawing from the subconscious the sensory images for conscious interpretation. The concept being that solutions to problems are always within you - they just need to be elicited and interpreted. As an exercise in problem solving, pose a question to yourself and write it down. You can work with a partner or a tape recorder, but start by sitting back, relaxing and closing your eyes. Begin by tuning into the visual images that present themselves and describe aloud your first, immediate impressions in rapid-flow, sensory detail. Note and explain the sounds, tactile sensations, tastes and emotional feelings you have as more free images emerge. Ask yourself questions as the images appear. Watch and listen for image answers or verbal answers. You can prompt the visual imaging process by staring at a bright light and closing the eyes or pinching the closed eyelids for a phosphene effect or simply imagining a closed door and flinging it open in your mind. In all cases, you describe the visual messages that come to you afterwards and attempt to integrate these subconsciously prompted images with conscious interpretation for improved creativity. The process of describing aloud the mind’s images allows the conscious mind to involve itself in this right brain activity. Ask yourself questions as images are acknowledged. Feel the texture of the images. Connect any sounds or smells that are involved with images. Move the images around or open them up or go beyond them in some way, and describe the result. If you’re having some difficulty with interpretation, ask your higher self for assistance in understanding your images. Continue for a few minutes, then rest and image-stream again for a new set of images for the same question. Repeat the process again for a third time with the same question or problem. Then look at your sensory image answers. What’s the same? What’s different? Can you relate any of these elements to your original problem, keeping in mind that the image answers may be symbolic in some way? Win Wenger declares that doing image-streaming on a regular basis can increase your I.Q. and allow more creativity in your life, so practice this exercise often."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"90  INNOVATIVE THINKING Exercise 54 -- Creating Clarity & Duration  With Visualizations V isualizations are directly associated with an unusual energy emitted by the mind. This energy can affect people and things depending upon its amplitude. Increasing your directional amplitude depends upon the clarity and duration of your visualization along with the purity of your belief structure; thus results vary from one person to another. With considerable practice, clear visualizations coupled with a firm belief system can coordinate this energy through you so you might perform feats of psychokinesis, telepathy, levitation and more. For example, an aikido master's thought process is so clear that he actually begins to toss an aggressor a split second before the moment that physical contact is made. When a karate grandmaster breaks a board, slow motion photography has shown that the board begins to break a split second before actual contact is made. This is the power of focused, clear thought in action. Most people visualize better than they believe they do. Sexual fantasies are a good example. You also visualize when you read a novel or listen to a story being told. Before the advent of TV, people relied heavily on radio stories and novels for their entertainment. They used their powers of visualization to see the story details in their mind's eye. TV eliminated the necessity of visualizing. Without practice in visualization, unused brain cells can deteriorate at an accelerated rate. To test your clarity and duration during visualization, sit still in a chair with your eyes closed and count from 1 to 100 while projecting onto your inner mental blackboard each numeral as you count. Stop counting when a stray thought intrudes and note the number. As with all skills though, practice can allow you to improve your visualization skills. Now visualize a cube consisting of 27 equal but smaller cubes (3 X 3 X 3). If the large cube is painted green on the outside, how many of the small cubes are painted on 3 sides? on 2 sides? on one side? How many cubes are unpainted? If you're having trouble with this, make the large cube the size of a house. Be an observer floating in the air around the house, counting the cubes."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"  INNOVATIVE THINKING  91 As an exercise in visualization improvement, imagine you have 3 apples in front of you in a row -- the one on the left is red, the one in the center is yellow and the one on the right is green. Now in your mind's eye, move the one on the right to the center. Now move the one on the left to the position on the far right. Now again move the one that now is on the left to the position on the far right. Now move the one in the center to the far left. Do you have their correct order in mind? What color is the apple on the right, in the center, and on the left? If you're having trouble with this, shift your mental perspective so you are looking down on the apples or maybe even from the side. Practice on your own moving the apples around until it becomes easy for you. Practice and perfect your visualization skills. While listening to people talk, form mental images of the situations that are being described, and constantly strive to improve the clarity and duration of your mental imagery."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"92  INNOVATIVE THINKING Exercise 55 -- Developing Quick Thinking The human mind is capable of lightning quick thinking (see \"Exercise -- Time Distortion\"), but primarily when in a relaxed, positive frame of mind. Do you remember the last emotional outburst or argument that you had? Did you get too flustered for a proper comeback? Did you say to yourself later on, \"I wish I had said (such and such)?\" W hen you allow the emotional side of your brain to gain control, the conscious thinking side of your brain is suspended. Quick response is easily achieved when you curb the impulse to flare up emotionally. For starters, exercise discipline over yourself and be silent when emotionally confronted (see \"Exercise -- Handling Criticism From People\"). This will give you a chance to see how another person blows off steam without getting embroiled in the process yourself. It will also give you practice in achieving more conscious control over your life. Policemen, bar maids and customer relations officers all practice being 'cool' headed thinkers, because it is their job to handle emotional retorts in a calmer way. Lack of emotional control brings about inefficiency, non-productivity and little progress. Like with other things, practice is the key to improvement. As an exercise, work with a partner that you barely know. Agree ahead of time that this exercise is only a game, and that the object of the exercise is NOT to get antagonistic with each other over it. Now let your partner act as target, and you start bombarding him with emotionally directed remarks, one at a time. Your partner's job is to keep as cool and as calm as possible, and retort back to you a response as quickly as he can. A split second of clear thinking is all that is necessary, and soon you'll get the knack of it. Afterwards, reverse the roles. If done in a workshop, it might help to listen to other pairs performing the exercise. Often you'll find a response directed in the form of a calm question will take an emotional person off guard, because to consciously formulate an answer, the thinking side of the brain is needed. With practice, you'll no longer need to fumble for your words. Quick responses will become second nature to you. One way to get the words to flow quickly when you're upset is to simply read aloud a page out of a book as fast as you can. This is also a good method to use in pulling yourself out of a depressive, hateful or lonely mood (but not for chronic conditions). The conscious effort is so intense to keep the rapid speed going that your emotional doldrums simply pass away as your awareness is shifted to a cortical task. Time yourself for speed and read the same page again, but go faster this time."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"  INNOVATIVE THINKING  93 To think fast in emergency situations is often a matter of life and death in some cases. How would you handle yourself in a fire, a bad car accident, a robbery or on a passenger liner sinking at sea? Campers have died of cold exposure with packs containing food and cooking stoves. Car occupants have frozen to death in their cars with a half a tank of gas left. People have drowned in 4 feet of water. Panic is a killer. Determined, quick thinking is a life saver. Injured outdoorsmen have dragged their smashed bodies for miles and survived. Women have given birth to children in the wilderness all alone. People have performed amputations or crude surgery on themselves and saved their own lives. As an exercise, visualize yourself in emergency situations where you correctly choose a creative alternative for survival. For instance, after falling through the ice on a frozen river, you breathe from the shallow air pockets trapped underneath the ice. You bail out of an airplane and your primary and secondary chutes don't open, so you cut a slit in your pack and pull the chute out. While in an elevator, the cable snaps and you grab a hold of the ceiling fan to break your eventual fall to the ground. By creating visualizations where you are an active participant, you build self- confidence and establish prepared scenarios in your mind to give you a better ability to handle yourself later. Even when totally different emergencies pop up, your readiness for them will produce better responses."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94  INNOVATIVE THINKING Exercise 56 -- Handling Emergency Situations R esearch has repeatedly shown that most people respond poorly in emergencies, giving little or no help when another person is suffering and needing help?! Why? Is it fear for their own safety, indifference or lack of training in the proper responses? Studies have shown that mental practice of an activity prepares you better for that activity by giving you a better response aptitude when you actually engage in the activity later. With crime and emotional instability increasing, sooner or later you will be tested to react to some form of emergency situation in your life. You don't have to respond with fear or panic, which often results in severe stress, injury or death by inappropriate action. Since emergencies are not always clearly labeled as such when they happen, they can often take you by surprise. Screams from the street may signal an assault in progress or it may be a domestic dispute. You can give a quick and more adequate response when you curb the impulse to flare up emotionally, and your previous mental preparation to emergencies can give you a better response aptitude when the time comes. This exercise is designed to give you such mental preparation. Through quick thinking and keeping a cool head in times of emergencies, you can often produce solutions to otherwise perplexing situations. Here are 2 such examples that actually happened: 1) A passing woman seeing a small child teeter-tottering on the edge of a high condominium balcony, immediately gathered other passers-by and formed a living net of arms. The child finally fell, and was saved in the nick of time. 2) An outdoorsman gathering wood away from his campsite was startled by a snarling wolf ready to attack. The man dropped to the ground and with a small stick began to draw a wavy line in the ground all the way back to his campsite and gun. The wolf was so intrigued with what the man was doing that he didn't attack until it was too late. Ordinarily, people derive most of their potential response information about new situations from how others around them behave. It's a rare individual who initiates action, unless he's been trained to do so by prior preparation or experience. For example, Kitty Genovese got stabbed to death, March 13, 1964, at 3 AM as she returned home from work. During the 35 minute attack, 38 of her neighbors in Kew Gardens, NY came to their apartment windows as she cried out in terror, but no one came to her assistance!

Dr. Edward de Bono, a psychologist and professor of investigative medicine at Cambridge University, created the phrase \"lateral thinking\" to depict the type of thinking attitude that comes with seeking solutions to problems through unorthodox methods or playing games with the data. This is different from \"vertical\" thinking where one solves a problem by going from one logical step to the next in achieving a solution. Some people refer to it as a right brain creative approach rather than a left brain analytical one. Oftentimes, people become blocked with one-sided opinions without seeing alternative sides to an issue. If you memorized the Encyclopedia Britannica, but did not have the ability to creatively apply what you memorized, its value would be minimal. Education without learning direct applicability to your life is unproductive. When exposed to a new idea, most people react by either liking it or disliking it. Then they use their intelligence to defend their decision because of their need to be right.

Expanding your mental capacity with creative thinking can be improved with practice. For instance, lay six stick matches on the table and make 4 equal sided triangles out of them. After struggling fruitlessly in 2 dimensions, you soon learn that a 3-dimensional tetrahedron is the only way to accomplish the task. If you learn to \"think wild,\" you can let yourself imagine all kinds of possibilities and alternatives to problems in your life, including those you would ordinarily consider impractical or ridiculous. For instance, think about the exact opposite of what normally comes to mind when you're posed with a problem; then elaborate on it from there. If you have an opinion and another person has an opposite point of view, visualize yourself in the other person's shoes for a change. List all the reasons why his opinion is valid; then list all the reasons why his opinion is invalid; and finally list all the irrelevant points. Many people become stymied by getting embroiled in describing, complaining and criticizing another person's viewpoint, instead of directing their thinking toward action and deciding what can be done about the situation. More than half of the world's greatest discoveries have been made through 'serendipity' or the finding of one thing while looking for something else; but remember, it takes a creatively aware person to recognize an opportunity when it presents itself. In emergencies, people tend to panic instead of using their head to determine their options. Many people hold opinions or views because they're blocked with emotional or prejudicial reasons. By expanding your scope to include the opposite viewpoint from your position, you often become quickly unblocked. While the U.S. leads the world in crime, drug addiction and indebtedness, Japan has little crime and drug addiction, and is the most solvent and educated nation in the world. Do you think emotional and prejudicial reasons keep U.S. officials blocked from learning from Japan's example or are there other reasons?

Without a clarity of purpose, all actions are either reactions to a situation or matters of habit or imitation.

Inquiring about it, he found out that the dog at his feet was not the proprietor's dog. Before making a decision, consider all the factors without taking what seems obvious for granted. In analytical thinking, you proceed directly from one state of information to another state. In creative thinking, you generate new ideas and approaches by extending yourself through imagination, intuition and inspiration to exceed the obvious. Keep this in mind when solving the following problems. 1) For example, how many squares are in the figure below? 2) Draw 4 connecting straight lines so they pass through all the following dots: 3) A truck went under a low bridge and got jammed so precisely that the driver could neither go forward nor backward. Mechanics could not pry the truck loose, but a small boy came by and told them how to get the truck out with little difficulty.

As an exercise, pick a problem -- say poor education. Now pick a random word in the dictionary -- say the 7th word on the 7th page -- apple. See what thoughts the word apple will generate in terms of the problem. For example, apple -- fruit -- kids like fruit -- kids bring apples to school -- better teaching, better education. Do the same thing with other random words for other problems. T hinking creatively takes practice. Begin looking around in your life for things that can give you creative self-expression. You can decorate your house in some creative way. You can dress in creative ways. Go to new or wacky locations for entertainment. Look for ideas everywhere. Draw, paint, play with clay, write songs, play a new musical instrument and have fun with yourself. When faced with a particular challenge, problem or situation, write a list of possible solutions, no matter how far out! There are no wrong answers, just possible solutions! Generate a flow of ideas. The act of writing them down often gets them out of the mind and into view for you to see. Ask others for input, and listen to what they say, but don’t tell them your ideas on the subject if they’re not positively oriented. Some people have a habit of derailing another point of view automatically, and this can be discouraging. In every situation you are in, consciously ask yourself how to best handle it creatively. This establishes a habit of thinking creatively. Don’t worry about whether your ideas will work or not. Worrying impedes the flow of creativity. The idea here is to practice thinking creatively until it becomes a habit."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"108  INNOVATIVE THINKING Exercise 63 -- Understanding Doubletalk & Buzz Words Doubletalk can be defined as a mixture of sensible terms and unfamiliar terms or familiar terms used in an unfamiliar context. The art of doublespeak or pseudo- communication is to provide what listeners want or expect in an illusory form so that it readily becomes accepted as real communication. You’re most susceptible to doublespeak when you tend to unconscious, unthinking, non-thinking public. When the actor, \"Dr.\" Myron Fox, was hired to lecture some years ago on the contrived topic, \"Mathematical Game Theory As Applied To Physician Education,\" he successfully deceived his audience of psychiatrists, psychologists, and educators using buzz words, doubletalk and non sequiturs. Even though they understood hardly anything he said, they were immensely impressed. It was an experiment to see how an ostensibly knowledgeable individual could present an aggressive, personable demeanor and overwhelm his listeners even though in essence he said absolutely nothing -- and it worked! Being impressive, but NOT giving understanding is the purpose of this exercise. A very poor but intelligent speaker can say a great deal in an unimpressive manner, while a brilliant and eloquent speaker may say exactly nothing. By learning how to impressively say nothing, you can learn to recognize it better in others. In this way, you can learn to be impressed or unimpressed with exactly what someone says, not with someone's credentials or particular position in life. Learning to give individual thought to what you hear, instead of just giving emotional reaction is important. You'll learn to believe or disbelieve something and KNOW why you do it. By questioning what you hear and read, regardless of its official source, your thinking on any subject will be sharpened and your decisions on its correctness for you will become more discerning and open- minded. Now concentrate on style, not content, and use the list of buzz words below (improvise and integrate your own words if you wish as well) to form 10 short sentences to deliver to a partner in an impressive manner.

As an exercise, for one week while you are conceptualizing your problems, carry a cheap small notebook and make drawings for yourself. Your drawings can be doodles, block diagrams, schematics, squiggles, sketches or whatever you wish. Observe which of these drawings helps you in problem solving and which do not. Drawings have an amazing power and ability to convey precise information, even if crudely done. Try it, you'll like it. Since art is basically a right brain activity, talk about your problems aloud to yourself while idly doodling and sketching anything which comes up. As a path to the subconscious is cleared, solutions will be automatically drawn in caricature or abstract form. If you choose the same room, chair and time of day for the exercise, daily repetition will eventually produce surprising results.

Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung (fertilize) it: And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.\" Look at the issues below and weave an allegorical story around each of them. 1) Exemplify in allegory people that seek primarily money & material things through- out their lives vs seekers of primarily knowledge and wisdom. 2) Illustrate in allegory the chemical companies that profit off the continuous use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides on crops vs the consumers ignorantly suf- fering the consequences of eating such crops. 3) Exemplify the U.S. policy in education vs the Japanese policy. You can look at the below example as a guide, but create your own allegory to describe each of the issues above. 1) Once there were 2 troupes of hungry monkeys. The members of the first troupe fought constantly over food supplies. They were gluttonous, wasteful and saved nothing. In lean times, they complained about their lacks and either starved or stole from other monkeys to survive. The second troupe of monkeys ate judicious- ly and stored food for the lean times.

Many times problems keep rattling around in your mind going unresolved because you have not put the pieces together properly. As a thinking exercise in completion, have a partner take any book and turn to a typical page. Now have him choose a sentence and write on a blackboard or sheet of paper the words in a jumbled fashion. You then unscramble the words and make a complete sentence out of them. At first, choose small sentences and then advance to longer sentences as the exercise gets easier to do. This exercise equips the mind with a better facility for putting words together in an intelligible sequence for interpretation. Choose complete sentences in this exercise, not phrases or incomplete thoughts. For example: Every in abilities day way every my are mental improving. Becomes: My mental abilities are improving every day in every way. One interesting exercise to jog you into getting in touch with yourself is through the process of sentence completion. Pick something that angers or frustrates you, like your job or a relationship. Then write 8 to 12 endings to an incomplete sentence pertinent to the subject as rapidly and as spontaneously as possible. If you get stuck, invent a completion, but don't give up or stop.

Some examples of palindromes are noon , radar , or \"Madam, I'm Adam.\" By proceeding through the alphabet and quickly interchanging double consonants with various vowels, many 3-letter words can quickly be achieved, like DAD or GAG. By expanding your inner vision to interposing double vowels between double consonants 4-letter palindromes can be achieved, like NOON or DEED.

A mind map consists of a central word or concept, around which you draw 5 to 10 main ideas that relate to that word or concept. Then you take each of those words and draw 5 to 10 main ideas that relate to each of those words. New ideas can be placed in the right place and the map encourages the reduction of each idea to a single word. A mind map is a way to organize your thoughts or ideas around a major theme or subject, and assist you in making brain linkages and connections for better recall later. You can apply the mind map principle to a variety of situations, whether it’s a book you just read, a lecture you just heard, or a vision you just had -- creating a mind map around its central theme can bring clarity and order to your thoughts, and you can depict it all on a single sheet of paper. Research by Tony Buzan on note taking revealed that out of the various methods of learning after a lecture - writing transcripts, writing summaries or writing key words - key words written by the student was the most effective way of remem- bering a lecture given to them. As an exercise in creating mind maps, use the below skeleton of a simple mind map and improvise from there with sample words or ideas that relate to the central theme of a book you just read or a movie you just saw and see how effective it is for organizing your thoughts. You’ll also find that reviewing your mind map later will bring the summary or essence of the book or movie back quickly to you. Also if the book or movie is particularly important for you to learn and retain, redrawing the mind map from memory a few times will implant the information very solidly in your memory."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme  main theme main theme main theme   Central Theme  main theme main theme main theme minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme minor theme"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"  INNOVATIVE THINKING  125 Exercise 77 -- Learning To Brainstorm Problems The brainstorming method of problem solving is a technique given its name by Alex Osborn, the founder of the advertising firm of Batten, Barten, Durstine and Osborn. Brainstorming groups usually consist of from 5 to 12 people who bombard a specific problem with diverse ideas. Four basic rules govern a brainstorming session: 1) Judgments of suggested ideas are suspended until later so that the group can proceed more with generating ideas than defending them. Negative looks, expressions and mannerism should be avoided by members. Avoid even \"That's a good idea\" type remarks, because they are still judgments. 2) Participants are encouraged to think of the wildest most spontaneous ideas possible and attack the problem with no holds barred. 3) An enthusiastic quantity of ideas is encouraged, because quantity increases the likelihood of obtaining some good solutions. 4) Participants are encouraged to build upon the ideas of the others to turn them into better ideas or modify two or more ideas in combination to produce a better idea. Brainstorming's growth came from a 12-man brainstorm panel which is still the size frequently used, although 7-member teams have become quite popular as well. To create a brainstorm panel, select people with a diversity of specialties, attitudes and backgrounds and perhaps only one member being very familiar with the material being brainstormed. Define the problem specifically and simply, avoiding vagueness and generality. As a brainstorm leader, diplomatically guide the group without creating a for- bidding atmosphere. Like a good team captain, stay in the background yourself and do not to take credit for the group's progress and accomplishments. Create an atmosphere of encouragement and select a location conducive to good results. For instance, holding a brainstorming session in an uncomfortable or noisy office could prove inhibiting. On the other hand, yellow walls, modern art and a bit of music in the background all seem to contribute to creativity in brainstorming rooms. A written record of the session's ideas should be kept. When later these ideas are evaluated for their usefulness, the entire list will serve as a basis for possible solutions. The principal value of group brainstorming is the fact that it can produce far more good ideas than a conventional conference, and in far less time. In actual practice, a brainstorming session can even be used by yourself, if you adhere to the same four basic rules. As an exercise, apply these same rules to a prob-"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"126  INNOVATIVE THINKING lem of your own without any group assistance. Secure a comfortable and quiet surrounding. With pencil and paper, write a sentence specifically outlining your problem. Surprisingly, simply defining the situation begins to produce a flurry of possible solutions. When the flurry starts, write down key words without elaboration to allow the flow to rapidly proceed along. To facilitate the definition process, write at least 3 additional ways of outlining the problem. What is it you really want or find dissatisfactory in your present situation? Realize that all problems appear simple after the solution is found. See in your mind's eye the pleasant outcome to finding the solution. Separate the problem into segments to make the steps in solving it more manageable. And finally, once the pondering has been completed, initiate some kind of action toward achieving results. You'll find that getting started on it carries a momentum that creates a vibration to figuring the rest out along the way. Be courageous and trust in yourself. Everything is far simpler if you look at it that way. Practice internal brainstorming on different problems and soon a free flow of thoughts will become a natural process.

The importance of suggestion in memory is exemplified in hypnosis when the suggestion -- you will NOT remember is implanted and that is indeed what happens. The subconscious mind believes this suggestion under hypnosis and does not allow the conscious mind to remember out of hypnosis. You have the choice of positively or negatively 'programming' yourself into learning or not learning your material. One hypnotized group was given positive suggestions that they would remember a given set of information, and a control group was not hypnotized and not told anything about positively or negatively learning a given set of information. Afterwards, the hypnotized group scored higher than the learning level exhibited by the control group. In another experiment, positive suggestions to learn better were given to one group prior to using 'sleep-learning' cassettes (but unknown to them, their speakers were unplugged and no actual sleep-learning input was available). A control group was given no suggestions at all prior to the same unplugged, sleep-learning input. The mere suggestion that the one group would learn better again significantly improved recall. In another example, there were 2 groups where one was exposed to an optimistic, positive teacher who expected good results, and the other group was exposed to a teacher with a negative attitude. Naturally, the group exposed to a positively expectant teacher improved their learning recall more than the negatively programmed group. As an exercise before learning a given set of material, eliminate negative state- ments from your conversation like, \"I hate (this subject or that),\" or \"I always forget (such and such),\" or \"I never can remember (those things).\" You certainly cannot expect to learn something better, if you tell yourself you can't learn it. Replace this negativity with positive programming by affirming to yourself at least 3 times, statements like, \"I am learning (this material) better today,\" or \"My memory is improving in (this area or that),\" or \"I always remember (these things).\" By doing this one thing alone, your recall will be improved by a significant percent and the positive belief system in yourself will be more firmly established."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"128  SUPER MEMORY Exercise 79 -- Ridiculous Associations Which is better for remembering something, to allow your memory to inadvertently make its own associative patterns, or to consciously create your own memory associations? Associative patterns are the unique binding factors in memory. Great writers of fiction have the marvelous ability to have you automatically create internal visualizations when you read their words. To remember facts, speeches, conversations or magazine articles, you can learn to create these internal images for yourself. Your memory can become powerful by creating exaggerated, ridiculous images, sounds or feelings involving wild, outlandish or sexually oriented material in your associations. For example, to remember a short grocery store list --- tuna fish, celery, beans and bread -- create the mental image of a tuna with celery stalks sticking out of its gills swimming on a slice of bread and defecating beans from its anus. Now memorize the following list of 12 words in the next 2 minutes using ridiculous, associative patterns (including action and sensory oriented ones), and keep the words in the arrangement that they are presented. Connect your associations so that you have 4 mental pictures of 3 words each. Then cover them up and write them down on a sheet of paper.

One further note: There is clear evidence that memories are very state dependent. If you are happy, fearful, listening to music, drunk, smoking or positioned in a favorite chair when learning something, the memory of that same something will be better recalled when you are in that same state again. It appears that linkages with emotion and sensory involvement bring about associative connections to further your recall. Since oftentimes it is not feasible to recreate a particular state in reality, it can nevertheless be accomplished through visualizing that same state internally. Now apply these principles to your own learning material, and create ridiculous associative visualizations for better recall. Personalize your ridiculous associations in some way with all your material to be remembered."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"130  SUPER MEMORY Exercise 80 -- Attention To Detail How many times a day do you go into your refrigerator, but when you're at the grocery store, forget what was in there? You have to learn to recognize the difference between looking and seeing. Don't be misled by 'seeing' only what you expect to see. See what actually exists. Be aware of visual tricks that can make you misinterpret what you think you see, and don't overlook the obvious. Without looking, does your wrist watch have Roman numerals or no numerals at all on it? What other details are depicted on it? How well did you do in recalling details on the watch that you look at every day? Walk past a store front window and recall as many articles in the window as possible within 15 seconds of study. Now do the same thing, but flick your attention from object to object for a split second at a time. Your eyes register more information in the first 1/10 of a second of looking at something than at any other time. If you rub 2 pennies together briskly between the thumb and forefinger, a \"third\" penny will appear between the other two. This retinal image appears for only a fraction of a second, but it is the principle of cinematography which gives you the impression of continuous motion through a series of rapidly proceeding picture frames. Daily practice of 'flicking' on landscapes and cityscapes will marvelously improve your powers of observation. Flick first, then close your eyes and see everything in your mind's eye.

His talent is the ability to 'read' the grooves on a phono- graph record and identify the music on it with the label covered! To improve your memory for detail, do the following 15 second exercise. Sit in a quiet location and look around you for a single object - a bottle, a comb or a brush. Now for 15 seconds, study that object like you’ve never seen it before. Concentrate and focus all your attention on that object and its details. Then after 15 seconds, cover it up or put it out of sight. Now write down a description of exactly the details you saw - the shape, the size, the color, etc. When you’re done, look at the object again and compare what you wrote with its true appearance. How close did you come? The next day, choose another object and take 20 seconds to look at its details. Repeat everything as you did before. Each day, repeat the exercise, adding 5 seconds and picking a new object each time. At the end of a week, check yourself. Are you concentrating with better perception? Is your attention to even minor details im- proving? Continue with the exercise, adding 5 seconds each time, and choosing objects that are progressively more detailed. Soon you will notice that this little by little increase in focus time gives you the practice to achieve total attention on any object you are viewing and with flawless memory of that object afterwards! To sharpen your memory awareness and attention to detail, put something you'll need the next day in an unusual place, like the keys to your car, your coffee cup or hat. When the next day comes, it will force you to replay in your mind where you put it and press you to be more consciously aware of things.

If your brain registers everything that pours into your senses, then you should learn how to elicit that information from your brain's storehouse. Certain concentration skills can be learned to help initiate this process. As a practice exercise, obtain and arrange the following materials. Cut a 15\" X 15\" square of black construction paper and paste a white 6\" X 6\" square in the center of it. Attach this paper arrangement to a light colored wall at about eye level (when seated in a chair). Seat yourself about 3 feet away and get in a comfortable, relaxed position. Close your eyes and for a couple of minutes, visualize a giant blackboard in your mind. Let distracting images pass on by, but keep your blackboard clear. Now open your eyes and gaze at the center of the square for 2 or 3 minutes. Move your eyes to a spot on the wall alongside the paper pattern and observe the after-image. When it starts to fade, imagine it is still there. Now close your eyes and recreate the whole pattern in your mind's eye. Keep it as steady as possible on your mental blackboard. Repeat the procedure 2 more times. As a variation of the above exercise, cut a 15\" X 15\" square of black construction paper and paste a white 10\" wide 5-pointed star in the center of it. Repeat the same gazing and visualizing procedure as before. Now visualize zooming in on the star to within a close proximity of it. Now zoom out to a point where it is very small. Repeat this process 2 more times; then see it back to normal size again. Now view it upside down in your mind's eye; then slowly rotate your perspective in a circular motion around it.

Daniel McCartney was born in Pennsylvania in 1817. His powers of memory were noticed at 5 or 6 years of age and they became fully acute at the age of 16. From that age on, he forgot nothing for the rest of his life! He learned nothing by reading, but only by hearing, for his eyesight was poor. He could give the cube root of numbers up to the millions almost instantly, and solve any other calculating problem given to him as well. He could give you the day of the week on any calendar date of the past. He knew 200 hymns and could sing 150 tunes. He remembered what he ate during each meal for over 50 years. When asked how he did it, he replied, \"I just know it.\" Aside from a few demonstrations, McCartney never made much use of his memory for profit, and remained poor and obscure for most of his life. Andre Marie Ampere was born in 1775 and revealed a remarkable calculating ability at an early age. As soon as he could read, he devoured every book he could find. Soon he became obsessed with his father's 20 volume set of encyclopedias and eventually committed them to memory. Ampere went on to become a professor of mathematics, chemistry, writer on probabilities, poet, psychologist, metaphysician and a discoverer of fundamental truths of electrodynamics. Although these two individuals seemed to have had certain channels in their minds naturally open, others can nevertheless open up these same super memory channels through training. Both mental mathematics and mental chess require an inner visual acuity of extreme detail, but often in a \"moving \" or flexible fashion. A photographic memory is the observational recall often referred to as eidetic imagery in children (37% have the ability at an early age). The ability is rare in adults, and involves seeing an inner picture that lasts for varying intervals with each individual. Some yogis develop a 'super memory' after doing daily exercises in raja yoga (mental yoga) for about a year. Through exercises in visualization, concentration, breathing and altering your state of consciousness -- control of the memory triggering mechanism is achieved and a 'photographic' memory is developed. If we remember something under hypnosis that we didn't remember out of hypnosis, then there must be either something impeding the associative retrieval process in our conscious state or the retrieval cues are more efficiently organized during hypnosis or both. During hypnosis, there is a quieting of the busy conscious mind, and a searching of the subconscious storehouse for the needed information."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"136  SUPER MEMORY This exercise can help you to recall material you have 'forgotten' by stimulating associative patterns in your subconscious storehouse. Before beginning this exercise, you should have mastered and practiced for one full week \"Exercise -- Concentration and Eidetic Imaging.\" Lie down and assume a relaxed, comfortable position. Take some deep, abdominal breaths, close your eyes and visualize a large blackboard in your mind's eye. Against the blackboard, imagine a white 12\" X 12\" square centered about one foot away from you. Hold this image steady and don't allow it to slide around in your mind. Now mentally put a small black circle about 2 inches in diameter in the center of the white square against the black background. Now vaporize the entire image to allow a void in your mind. Observe the images that appear. W hen this exercise is prefaced with a desire to recall a lost item, certain facts or old information, there is a freer flow of associations from the subconscious to the conscious mind. With lots of practice, your mental blackboard will always be able to bring up the information that you require in an almost 'photographic' way. Even though photographic implies visual, Mozart had the faculty of perfect pitch, where music is heard and indelibly imprinted in the brain after only one hearing of it. Others have the faculty of performing a kinesthetic action only once (as in a gymnastic or martial arts movement), and completely remembering it afterwards."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"  SUPER MEMORY  137 Exercise 83 -- Rhythmic Memorizing It is believed that singing songs in the Greek and Roman times constituted the reiteration of a passage or a tale with perhaps only a slight intonation to the voice. Before Homer's day, memorizers called bards passed along the tales of the Trojan war and other stories of the Bronze Age for hundreds of years only to have them eventually transcribed and recorded by Homer for posterity. Songs and long poems were related by bards in total completeness by memory alone, and it is not unlikely that such bardic memorizing involved some form of intonation to the voice. Why do you think many TV and radio advertisements stress song and intonation to convey their product message? Because it sticks better in the brain, that's why. Rhythm has an interesting effect on developing your mental abilities. It is also an avenue to right brain processing. The following superlearning exercise from Bulgaria gained wide acclaim some years ago. Select information bits (foreign vocabulary or whatever) that you want to learn. Get in a comfortable position, close your eyes, relax and do some deep breathing to prepare yourself. Next, have your assistant read to you the material to be learned in 4-second intervals. Have your assistant read a bit of information for 4 seconds, then pause for 4 seconds; and then continue this 4-second read and pause process over and over with different bits of information. While your assistant does this, you rhythmically breathe in and out during the 4-second silent period, and hold your breath during the 4-second reading period. Within just 15 minutes, you'll be able to assimilate over 80 new bits of information quite easily. To help pace yourself with the 4-second tempo, record a tapping sound every 4 seconds on a repeating loop tape and play it during the session. Keep the learning sessions about 20 to 30 minutes long. To enhance the effect, play a largo movement (60-beat per minute cycle) of specific baroque compositions (Bach, Telemann, Handel, Vivaldi or Corelli) in the background. The slow 60-beat per minute tempo of the largo movement entrains your heartbeat to beat at the same pace, and this relaxed state in turn slows your brain wave activity as well. Hence, your body/mind relaxes, but at the same time keeps you alert and receptive. After several months of this practice, your mind develops a semi-photographic memory ability as well. If you design a tape for a headset, put the baroque music on the left ear track (for the right brain) and the rhythmic recitation of information on the right ear track (for the left brain). Even without baroque music, a tape designed rhythmically and played"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"138  SUPER MEMORY   as a 'sleep-learning' tape (see \"Exercise -- Sleep-Learning\") produces good results. Repeat each bit of information 3 times in the 4-second speak, 4-second pause tempo as described above. If the intonation of the taped voice is varied from soft, to commanding, to normal each time or even sung intermittently, the right brain 'attends' to the material more easily. If the voice is from a member of the opposite sex, the memorizing attentiveness is enhanced even more. Also, make each 4-second bit of information a complete fragment to facilitate better grasping and not a thought cut in half. In addition to this, precede your memorizing session with positive affirmations concerning the material presented. For those people that are visual minded, a video tape can be designed with visual information blips accompanied by verbal explanations every 4 seconds while baroque music is played in the background. For those people kinesthetically inclined, the information input can be through braille or other feeling types of input. A good memory is a skill that can improve with practice, so take advantage of small fragments during your normal day and get conscious about remembering things."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"   SUPER MEMORY  139 Exercise 84 -- Observational Recall To train a ninja assassin to observe the enemy and to obtain as much useful and specific information as possible, the ancient masters devised a \"game of stones.\" Use a small wooden box or shallow wicker tray and place in it stones, jewelry, silverware, keys, coins and small household items so that the bottom is completely covered. Now expose to a partner the uncovered container in front of your. Now have him look at the items as long as desired and even touch and feel them. After he sufficiently examines them, cover the container and have him relate what was see. Check for accuracy and take time in referring to the ones he missed. Now cover the box and have him reiterate once again everything that he saw. This time also ask him to relate details about the container! This teaches him not to be so absorbed in detail that the overall picture is obscured. Repeat the game until observation improves to 100%. A college professor demonstrated to his freshman classroom the lack of observational awareness in most people by staging a sham murder. As he began his class, a thin, small busted, white woman (5'11\") in a T-shirt and jeans, wearing a baseball cap over short hair burst into the room and shouted, \"This is a joke.\" She carried a bow and quiver, but shot the professor with a blank pistol one time. She dropped the bow and quiver, and quickly left the room as the professor slumped to the floor. Through the classroom pandemonium, the professor arose from the floor seconds later, and visibly removed a mock arrow from a pretended wound in the side. After calming the class, he instructed them to write down the answers to the following questions: 1) What did the assailant say? 2) What was the assailant wearing? 3) Describe the assailant -- male or female, black or white, short hair or long, fat or thin, tall or short, etc. 4) What action did the assailant take? Astonishingly, there was very little, accurate agreement among the classroom students. Eyewitnesses to crimes are often just as unreliable."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"140   SUPER MEMORY Exercise 85 -- Using Sensory Learning Links Research has shown that if you learn something while drunk, it will be better remembered when you are inebriated again. State related memory links can often assist your learning capacity. For instance, learning something in a certain seat or in a certain posture represents a kinesthetic linked state. When tested later in the same seat or with the same posture, scores are higher than when tested in an alternative seat or posture. Research has also revealed that odors can not only evoke long forgotten memories, but they can serve as definite learning links. In controlled experiments, students that learned something while in the presence of a certain odor remembered that same information better when in the midst of that same odor again. The more unique the aroma, the better. When learning foreign vocabulary, seeing the words to be learned is visual input. Hearing them is auditory input, and this doubles the sensory input to the brain. If you choose words that are represented by odors, you have a third pathway to the brain. Olfactory impulses travel a shorter, more direct route to your brain than do visual or auditory messages, and they do not criss cross like other neural connections on each side of your body. When foreign vocabulary and odors are presented together, word lists are retained more easily. For example, smell the odor of cheese as you learn the Spanish word 'queso.' Smell various fruits, spices and flowers while simultaneously reiterating aloud their foreign word equivalents. Now touch and hold various objects, fruits or animals as you learn their equivalent foreign word. Now taste certain fruits, vegetables and foods as you associate their foreign word equivalents. Kinesthetically act out appropriate words in descriptive pantomime, and let the motor movements assist in establishing associative, memory patterns. In the absence of actual physical stimuli, simply visualize tasting, smelling and touching various items while saying aloud the appropriate foreign word (review \"Exercise -- Imagining Your Senses\"). This visualization process will reinforce your memory process when you are unable to physically make the associations with your senses."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"   SUPER MEMORY  141 Exercise 86 -- Learning Foreign Vocabulary As an exercise, type a list of foreign vocabulary words in capital letters with their English equivalents alongside them.

Using all capital letters allows the brain less confusion in deciphering the upside down shape of the words. Holding the page in the left field of vision projects the images to the right brain. The right brain is the acknowledger of upside down, mirror and backwards-type language. It is also the primary avenue to the storage area of long term memories. Hence by directing your memorization process to that side of the brain first, the number of repetitions to learn the vocabulary is greatly reduced. Singing or saying the vocabulary with intonation does the same thing. As another exercise, choose nouns that depict objects, animals or tangible things. Now create a mental image of the item in a blown-up or exaggerated form and print the letters in large print across the item. For instance, the Spanish word for bed is 'cama.'

Most people automatically form various subconscious associations, but if you pay attention and form conscious associative patterns, your memory can improve dramatically. Memory experts create mnemonic systems to assist in this conscious, associative process. A mnemonic is using some mechanism for associating unknown material with something familiar. In so doing, it relieves the burden on your short- term memory, because your recall can be achieved through association with an already existing memory in long term storage. For instance, a simple mnemonic association for remembering the number 1224 is that it is one day before Christmas, 12/25. Using a mnemonic system, memory experts can often remember a long series of numbers or even multiple groups of numbers. One man in the Guiness Book of Records recited pi from memory to 40,000 places in 1987. To improve your own memory with numbers, the following mnemonic system can be easily learned. Num bers can be remembered easier by being converted to letters, so learn the corresponding memory pegs that are arranged as follows: DIGITS LETTERS  REASONS 1 T OR D There is 1 downstroke in a small t. 2  N  There are 2 downstrokes in a small n. 3  M  There are 3 downstrokes in a small m. 4  R The fourth letter of the word four is R. 5  L  Your 5 fingers, with thumb extended forms   an L.

You fumble in the conversation trying to cover up your forgetfulness while you try desperately to recall the name. Some people even announce in advance, \"I never remember names,\" almost like a form of bragging; or maybe in an attempt to establish a camaraderie with a host of others who share the same non-admirable trait. This also relieves them of the responsibility in their minds of remembering your name, or the name of anyone else they meet. Nevertheless, people like hearing their name, and if you remember it, they're flattered and impressed with you more than if you forget it. If you consciously keep your wits about you when you're being introduced, you'll find recall much easier. For instance, take a few seconds to record and reiterate in your mind the person's name. Decide to yourself to remember it. Repeat it aloud immediately afterwards, (people love to hear their name repeated) and maybe ask the person how it's spelled. Repeat it in your conversation and visualize it written in bold letters on one of the person's body parts -- breasts, head, buttocks, etc. Distort the prominent feature of the individual body part to accommodate the letters. Be outlandishly creative. Perhaps the name itself reminds you of some ridiculous imagery. Usually the first part of the name is all that's necessary to create your mental picture. For instance, visualize Mr. Ashely with his face or body buried in ashes. Visualize Mrs. Rosen with roses in her nose, ears and mouth. Make an affirmation to yourself right now to remember every name of every person to whom you are introduced. Repeat new name associations periodically to yourself throughout the day, and have a mental set ready for new introductions. In any social situation, a person considers his name as very important. Getting a person's name wrong is perhaps the only thing worse than not remembering it at all.

In Simonides' absence, the ceiling of the banquet hall collapsed crushing everyone inside beyond recognition. By mentally walking through the hall, Simonides remembered everyone by their seating location and thereby established names for the bodies. This memory method was hence called the LOCI system, and is often used by lecturers to remember the main points in a speech to be given. If I asked you how many windows were in your house, you would take an imaginary walk through your house to find out, right?! The ancient Greeks and Romans used the 'loci system' in memorizing long speeches by simply visualizing the topics they wanted to cover in the form of representative objects placed in various familiar places -- steps, walls, porches, shelves and patios of their home and courtyard. To keep the speech flowing in sequence, an orator simply walked in his mind through his house and courtyard, checking each location off as he went. This technique is a surprisingly comfortable and easy one. For this exercise, select in your mind a special room in your house where you could store or place things easily. In place of your house, the loci system can also be used with the various areas of your car, office or even your own body by proceeding from your toes to your head and placing things in appropriate places.

Organoleptic analysts (food sniffers) for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration smell and test food for spoilage from dog food to fish. They are swifter and far more reliable with their nose than any chemical test that could be used. Helen Keller could identify her friends as they entered the room by their odors alone. Natives in primitive areas of the world still rely heavily on their sense of smell to seek out prey and detect possible enemies. Many jungle fighters rely on their sense of smell to gain an advantage in confrontations. Tuba Mbae, a Paraguayan healer once built up a flourishing reputation by making diagnoses from smelling the patient's shirts, socks or underclothing. Oriental medicine still includes smell as part of a standard diagnosis. When you go into a room full of various scents and aromas, can you discern most of them? Do you even notice them? Which do you think crackles the brain cells more, the acknowledging and consciously identifying of different odors in your environment or the ignoring of those same scents? By heightening your olfactory awareness, you can conceivably enter a room and tell who had been there before you, or what was on the stove or what medicines, flowers or perfumes were in the air. Practicing with this exercise will make you better at odor discernment. Unlike your other senses though, a good olfactory memory is more quickly acquired, and stays with you longer, because it shares the same brain center (the limbic system) that involves your basic emotional responses (pleasure, fear, anger and sex). Olfactory impulses travel a shorter, more direct route to your brain than do visual and auditory messages, and they do not criss cross like other neural connections on each side of the body. Subjects that learned over 100 different household odors from vinegar to perfume were tested a couple days later and were found to have about a 65% - 70% retention rate -- and when tested years later, the same percentage existed. Much of memory concerns state-related associations. In one experiment, students memorized a given set of words in the presence of a certain odor. When the students were given the same set of words the next day in the presence of the same odor, they showed much better recall than a control group learning the same words and exposed to no odor on either day. With people who have vivid visualization abilities, just imagining an odor while learning something can work equally as well. As an exercise, put small quantities of 10 different pipe tobaccos, herbs, spices,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"   SUPER MEMORY  149 gelatin flavors, incense or flower essences into small bottles and give an identifying label to each. After smelling each one, imagine its odor in your mind connected to some other sensory image (review \"Exercise - Developing Synesthesia\"). Ask yourself, \"What does this odor feel, sound or taste like (smell and taste are normally synesthetically combined anyway when you eat a meal)?\" You might create a specific visual scene that the scent reminds you of; or an auditory or tactile association that you feel is appropriate for each smell; or connect a color to each odor if that feels appropriate. Then have your assistant let you smell and identify each bottle again, but this time while you're blindfolded. Record your score of successes. Mix combinations of 3 scents together and label each mixture; then identify the separate scents in each combination while blindfolded. Since the nose becomes rather desensitized to an odor in a matter of seconds, you can quickly clear your nose by sticking it into your armpit if you're wearing a natural fabric like wool, cotton or linen. Next, have your assistant give you a different batch of 10 scents with their appropriate identification, but this time connect to each one something emotional. For instance, imagine how horrible the odor would taste; or create a specific emotional incident in your life to connect with each aroma. (Remember, your basic emotions and your olfactory brain center share the same limbic neural network, so you may already associate many odors with certain emotions, from nausea to pleasantries.) After connecting each identified aroma with something emotional, let your assistant give you the scents in a mixed way again for you to recall while blindfolded, and see if your score of successes is better this time. During the day every time you smell an unfamiliar odor, find out what it was and commit it to your memory storehouse. Correct identifications of smells and odors make you more aware of your surroundings, and all connective brain pathways established in your memory make other areas more accessible and easily usable. The more you recognize available information in this world, the more adequate and versatile you become.

When American soldiers were captured and subjected to an incessant, behavioral modifying treatment without sleep, their political ideologies were altered and their minds were turned against their countrymen. As cruel as such treatment seemed, it opened up gateways to a more thorough understanding of the brain's functioning. By fatiguing, confusing and quieting the left brain's conscious, analytical process, the receptive right hemisphere could absorb material subjected to it with little difficulty -- like feeding an organic computer. In one total immersion experiment, Spanish was taught to a male student in 61 hours! The student was kept awake during the entire 61-hour period with only 10 minute pauses every hour. During this process, he was bombarded with instructions and questions by five Spanish teachers who worked in shifts. The theory was that if a man could be kept awake long enough, his brain would become so tired that he couldn't think. Not thinking, he couldn't analyze, and therefore whatever he heard, he'd absorb and retain, the experimenters reasoned. After 12 hours, the student had mastered a Spanish vocabulary of 1,000 words (twice as much Spanish as a student would normally get in 4 hours a week for 3 weeks). By the 44th hour, the student faded. He was too tired to think. He stopped translating Spanish into English to understand the meaning. For the remaining hours, he talked to the instructors completely in Spanish. The student suffered no after affects, remembered his speaking vocabulary quite well and never once felt like he was being brainwashed throughout the whole experiment. For this exercise, do not participate as a student or instructor if there are any medical reasons for you not to do so. Select 3 to 6 instructors that are willing to rotate in 2 to 6 hour shifts and coordinate accordingly.

Just before drifting off to sleep at night and again in the morning after coming out of a deep sleep, there is a semi- conscious, reverie state of mind when the alpha and theta brain waves are at their optimal output (at 7 to 13 cycles per second and 4 to 6 cycles per second respectively). Material recited onto a 12-minute loop tape and played during these time periods is more readily retained than at any other part of the sleep cycle. The sleep period where the brain waves are below 4 cycles per second is called the unconscious delta state and the brain wave level above 13 cycles per second is the fully conscious beta state. As an exercise, create a 12-minute loop tape with the information that you want to learn. Then put it on a timer to be played one hour upon going to sleep and one hour upon awakening. For example, with Spanish vocabulary, say the following: \"This is your Spanish vocabulary for the night. You are relaxed and in a twilight sleep. You will remember the following words forever.\" Then read your vocabulary to be learned onto the repeating tape in 4-second intervals as in \"Exercise -- Rhythmic Memorizing.\" If the material to be learned was recorded at 212 times normal speaking speed with a special tape recorder and still spaced at 4-second intervals, it would increase the bulk to be absorbed (see \"Exercise - High Speed Listening\"). Learning in this manner is utilizing the otherwise idle moments during the night. One study revealed that sleep-learning improves with time. Apparently the brain gets better accustomed to absorption with more practice. If you design your tapes with affirmations, you can lose weight, increase your self-confidence, stop smoking or help correct any number of habit patterns while you sleep. By directing positive, beneficial thoughts of success, achievement and happiness to the subconscious mind, powerful personality changes can be accomplished while you sleep."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Heightened Sensory Section"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  153 Exercise 94 -- Imagining Your Senses How can you know what a state is like before you experience it? Levels of sensory acuity are also like that. For instance, your finger tips can be trained to distinguish the subtleties of braille, but before you acquired your discerning ability, your fingertips only experienced a grosser touch. When your touch becomes acute, you can remember what it was like before and the difference between then and now. The same with your visualizing acuity as it improves. You can grossly imagine something or get so acute that you can do mathematics or play chess in your head. What can you imagine in your mind's eye? How about a color beyond the range of human perception? How about a sound beyond the range of human hearing? Now let's expand your imagination through the following exercise: (Visual) Imagine -- the color of a red apple.  -- the shape of a star.  -- the flashing of a green strobe light.  -- the number 7 on a blackboard changing into a 3-  dimensional lion leaping from the blackboard.

For this exercise, secure a friend that is willing to relate to you what he or she is experiencing in a sensory way. Now take a walk or a drive or go to a restaurant and relate to each other what you are seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing and feeling as you experience each sensory activity. Most people all too often neglect to relate to another person what they experience in a sensory way. By doing so, extraordinary differences can be picked up and an enrichment of the experience can be added.  When two people do the same thing, it's   not the same thing at all.   Publilius Syrus"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"156  HEIGHTENED SENSORY Exercise 96 -- Developing Synesthesia Each person's senses differ in their sensitivity and perceptual interpretation. Synesthesia is the capacity for a stimulus in one sense to evoke an image or response in another sense. Smell and taste are synesthetically associated to one another in most people. The smell of an apple prepares the brain for the taste of an apple when you bite into one. With your nose stopped up, mashed apples and mashed potatoes taste almost the same. Natural synesthetes blend their senses in unusual ways. Some synesthetes \"taste\" words, \"feel\" flavors and \"see\" sounds. For instance, one woman 'saw' a long chain in the air as a kitten purred. A ringing phone displayed to her diamond-shaped blocks in the air. Another woman heard the word Massachusetts and she 'tasted' newspaper, or she heard the word New York and received a 'taste' of toast. One peculiar case involved a man that tasted something sour only to 'feel' a pointed shape. When he tasted a certain sauce, he said it 'felt' angular. Perhaps a more common form of synesthesia involves seeing colors when certain musical notes are played. Some composers \"suffered\" from this malady and made use of it. Russian composers Aleksandr Scriabin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov both \"sound painted\" many of their compositions in an elaborate system of matches between colors and keys. In fact, research has shown that synesthetes reflect a consistency in their sound to color experience. Studies have shown that during episodes of synesthesia, blood flow to the higher cortex decreases dramatically, which indicates at least the phenomena is not involving the cortical areas where your imagination is running wild. One example where a synesthete experienced \"dark purple triangles\" when he listened to a \"clicking sound\" revealed no activity in the visual cortex center at all. In fact, most research indicates an increased blood flow in the lower limbic region of the brain during synesthetic episodes. The Russian mnemonist, Shereshevskii, appeared to have no limit to what he could memorize with the help of his natural synesthetic abilities. Every sound that he heard evoked visual images of distinct form, color and taste. He could repeat learned material in reverse order, and recall it without difficulty even years later. Since synesthetes usually have better memories, developing a synesthetic skill can no doubt enhance your own memory. As an exercise to simulate a synesthetic experience, scratch a partner's back through his shirt while he consciously attends to the activity. Let him listen to the"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  157 sound of the scratching and inwardly feel the sensation with intensity. Now while your partner has his eyes closed, scratch your own back. Allow your partner to hear the sound of the scratching while \"feeling\" the sensation of it for himself at the same time. Then reverse your roles. Vary the tactile and sound combinations, but each time have your partner feel it first and imagine it afterwards. Now take the word IMPROVEMENT and think of it for a minute. Say it aloud and play with it. Use it in several phrases. Roll the word on your tongue. Is it stale, fresh or aromatic? How does it feel? Is it long, short, fat or skinny? Does it have a texture of smooth, soft, hard, pointed, mushy or prickly? How heavy is it? Does it evoke visual or auditory images? Just as squeaking chalk on a blackboard evokes goose bumps on some people, pleasant music can evoke other sensory impressions if you allow yourself that capacity. Many people already associate high-pitched sound with bright colors and low-pitched sounds with more somber hues. Now assume a comfortable position and relax yourself completely. Now have someone play a provocative piece of classical music that you're not already familiar with. As the music begins, open up all your senses to it. Imagine that your skin is hearing and feeling the texture of each note as the music flows over and through you. Imagine your nose is smelling the flavor of it, and your mouth is drinking in each tone, and tasting the savor of it. Visualize an array of colors swirling around you in brilliant hues as the music is played. Use your powers of visualization and let the music sweep through all of your senses. Allow a kinesthetic involvement, and move your hands and body if you wish. Write down what each note smells, tastes or feels like in emotional way. In this way, the limbic system can orchestrate a fusing of the senses for the right brain's musical experience. With continued practice, a synesthetic appreciation of music will eventually develop in you. Play various notes on a piano or other instrument individually and interpret each as resembling sweet, bitter, sour or neutral. What color would you choose to associate with each note? Do you perceive any visual images or forms when the notes are played? When you eat something in the future, consciously 'attend' to the activity. Notice the smells commingling with the tastes. Discern how flavors feel to you. Whatever you do during the day, imagine a mixing to take place in your sensory involvement. Although true synesthetes do not imagine their synesthetic episodes, this exercise will bring you as close as possible to what synesthetic sensations are like."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"158  HEIGHTENED SENSORY Exercise 97 -- Improving Your Kinesthetic Instincts In the movie, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Sundance was asked to shoot a tin can with his gun out of the holster. He took aim with his eye and missed. When he put his gun into his holster and drew from the hip, he hit the can easily and instinctively . Instinct is a catch-all word that describes an 'unconscious' activity which is hard to describe in words. If you act instinctively, you just know how to do a certain thing. In sports and games, you often develop kinesthetic instincts that enable you to play well -- dunking basketballs, shooting arrows, throwing a knife, playing darts, pitching horseshoes, etc. A man delivering consistently good tennis shots across the net is exhibiting this unconscious faculty in his accuracy. If an opponent comments to him about his remarkable play, his conscious awareness more likely will interrupt the fluidity of his kinesthetic swinging and his timing will invariably be disrupted. The spatial variables of the tennis game are more completely understood by the non-analytical side of the brain. One way to disengage the verbal, analytical side of the brain from interrupting your play is to say, \"Bounce!\" whenever the ball bounces, and \"Hit!\" whenever it hits the racket. This procedure takes your mind off the analysis of your shots. Less involved kinesthetic activities like walking, running, bicycling or shifting car gears are less easily disrupted. Balancing, juggling or doing gymnastics require more synchronized coordination. To improve your bowling or your shooting of a bow and arrow, distract the analytical side of the brain by bringing your conscious awareness to your breathing and count to 10 as you inhale. To improve your basketball, use the basket as the center of a clock. Call out your position as the time of day before you shoot. For example, as you move to the side of the basket to shoot, say to yourself, \"I'm at 3 o'clock.\" Recite the 2's table while doing gymnastics, playing soccer or wrestling. When skiing, call out numbers to indicate the angle of your skis with the snow. Repeat an affirmation over and over while hitting a baseball or playing golf, like \"I'm getting better and better.\" Sing a tune while fencing or shooting skeet. As an instinctive exercise for the tennis player, practice hitting tennis balls at a tin can without thinking analytically right or wrong.

If you try to think about your actions and exercise conscious control, you lose control. Improve the attitude of the exercise by extending excitement and enthusiasm towards the object and the lesson. Then enjoy yourself and simply let go. Japanese Buddhist monks can throw consistent bull's eyes into a dart board by using their peripheral vision alone. A football quarterback going back to pass, instinctively uses his peripheral vision to avoid on rushers while focusing his attention on the intended recipient of his pass. For instinctive practice, read something on a blackboard in front of you while throwing paper wads or coins into a bucket at varying angles to the right or left of you. Archery in the days of Robin Hood was a right brain \"kinesthetic instinctiveness,\" not the left brain sighting-device approach of today. The 'instincts' of some martial artists are so keen that they can virtually break or catch an arrow in flight toward them. To improve kinesthetic skills, first visualize the action you want to take (see \"Exercise -- Improving Your Visualization Skills\"). See and feel yourself doing it correctly. When you get good at that, you'll find that it'll only take a moment to precede the movement inwardly and you'll achieve better results. As an exercise, hold a wine glass in your left hand and pour water into it from a long necked watering can at a distance of 3 to 4 feet away without spilling a drop!

When your temperature is high, your physical and mental performance are faster. Controlling your body temperature could prove useful in certain daily situations where external heat or cold has reached extreme degrees. A passing 'grade' for a Tibetan lama from a lamasary school is to go out onto a frozen lake stark naked and with his body heat alone, evaporate the moisture out of two water soaked blankets! Such extraordinary feats are quite possible when you master complete control over your bodily functions. Even though your normal body temperature is 98.6°F, your finger temperature varies between the 70's and the 90's. To alter the temperature of a finger by several degrees in a few minutes of concentration is just as easy as thinking about it. As you learned in \"Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness,\" just thinking of one of your hands increases the blood volume to that hand. Focused thought to other areas of the body can bring about an increased blood volume into those areas as well. When blood volume increases, the capillaries in the skin dilate and the temperature of the skin increases. When blood flow decreases, the blood vessels in the skin constrict and temperature decreases. As an exercise, take an ordinary medical thermometer and tape it to your forefinger, or even better, use a Radio Shack thermometer with 9 foot cord and sensor thermistor that can be taped to your finder. You can easily read the digital display in 0.1 degree increments. Now raise the temperature of your finger by extending your conscious awareness into it. Experience the feeling of the tape and thermometer touching it, but ignore the thermometer completely. Now try different visualizations (sun's rays, hot water, campfire, etc.) to raise the temperature of the forefinger and just \"feel\" it warming up. Coincide this process with deep, steady abdominal breathing. If you forcefully try to 'will' your finger to get warm, a bodily reaction of 'fight or flight' results in a constriction of the blood vessels in preparation for violent action, and you achieve the reverse effect -- coolness. The more relaxed and calm you feel, the better your success. After 4 minutes, retape the thermometer or thermistor to your other forefinger to see which hand is easier to regulate the temperature of. To make your fingers cooler, visualize digging with your fingers into the icy snow of an avalanche that has partially engulfed you or visualize some other stressful scene or dangerous situation.

Practice using 2 thermometers, and make one temperature go up and the other go down. Afterwards, practice with other parts of your body. When you can successfully regulate your finger temperature, you realize the same techniques of temperature regulation can be used on other parts of your body as well.

When a typist makes a typing mistake, a new neural pathway is established, and the same mistake is often repeated again until a conscious thought reestablishes the correct pathway. As an exercise, look into a mirror and move your various facial muscles, scalp muscles, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth and finally your ears. (You can practice this at home while shaving or putting on your daily makeup.) Now move and bend each one of your fingers individually. Do the same with your toes after taking off your shoes and socks. While seated flex, twist or move the various muscles in your legs, stomach, chest, shoulders, back and neck. Explore yourself and direct your attention to your different muscle groups for more conscious control. Once your conscious awareness discovers or strikes upon the correct motor and neural pathways it is seeking, the kinesthetic flexing activity can be repeated and refined. In this way, some people have learned how to move their ears in different ways.

If you fall into such a category, this exercise should be omitted. Getting in touch with your own body can often bring you a better awareness of its difficulties. Now take off your shoes and socks and stand up with your feet about a foot and a half apart. Put your hands behind your back and hook your thumbs together, palms turned outward. Now extend your arms away from your body as you arch your body back and look toward the ceiling. Hold that posture for 6 - 12 seconds while breathing slowly. Then bend forward toward your toes, but keeping your thumbs locked and your arms extended. Hold that posture for 6 - 12 seconds while breathing slowly. When we say, \"twisted\" or \"bent out of shape,\" we reflect an association between abnormal body posture and emotional imbalance. Oftentimes, a daily self-massage can relieve many of your postural difficulties, and hence bring you into better emotional balance too.

Pay special attention to sore points in your feet as well as your hands, which correspond to internal areas, often organs, and acupressure these points for relief. Work your way up the body to your face and scalp by gently kneading each muscle group. Feel and get in touch with your bones, fat and sinew.

Are your food and beverage prefer- ences based upon real or imagined flavor distinctions? Are you greatly influenced by advertising about a product's quality? Your taste buds are grouped in tiny bumps called papillae which make your tongue feel rough. There are about 245 taste buds to each bump in a young person. Gradually with age, this number drops to below 100. Some taste buds are scattered on the inside surface of the cheeks and on the epiglottis and on the soft palate. There are actually only 4 basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter and salty. Salt buds are along the sides of the tongue and toward the front (as are the sweet buds), while sour ones are toward the back. Bitter taste buds are at the back of the mouth itself. Heated food stimulates your taste buds, whereas cold desensitizes them. For example, before taking a bitter medicine, use a small piece of ice to chill the back of your tongue and you'll hardly taste the medicine. Also, hot, sweetened coffee tastes sweeter before it cools. Since you taste and smell food at the same time, a blending of the two senses (see \"Exercise -- Developing Synesthesia\") takes place. For example, when you say an apple \"tastes good,\" you refer largely to its odor. If you were blindfolded and had your nose stopped up, you'd have trouble identifying raw mashed apples from raw mashed potatoes. People also eat with their eyes a lot! Purple mashed potatoes tasted terrible to most people even though the purple food coloring had no taste at all!

In the James Bond movie, \"You Only Live Twice,\" Bond sipped a glass of saki and determined it was correctly heated to the proper temperature of 98.4°F. As an exercise, heat a cup of tea or coffee and put a floating thermometer in it. After a few minutes and while looking at the immersed thermometer's temperature, taste the drink and determine for yourself what that temperature feels like. Two minutes later, do the same thing, each time keeping the thermometer in the cup and acknowledging to yourself what the temperature feels like in the mouth. Do this for several days, and then determine what the temperature is without looking first at the thermometer. How did you do? Now heat some water and pour it into a cup. With your fingers, test the water's temperature over a span of several minutes and check each time with a thermometer. Are you improving? Next, carry a thermometer with you during the day and by using your tactile awareness, determine what the temperature is at odd points during the day. Using a barometer, determine the air pressure in the same way. Indians and old woodsmen sometimes perceive these subtle differences and determine stormy weather ahead of time. One researcher claims that 30% of the general population is notably weather- sensitive in some way. When the barometer drops, your body cells must lose water to adjust to changing atmospheric pressure. Because of arthritis, rheumatism or some old bone injury, inflamed or stiff body areas do not depressurize fast enough and pain is felt. Some people feel headaches or other pains debarking from a de-pressurized jet in mountainous airports for similar reasons. To help your body cells adjust faster and avoid the pain, thrust your conscious awareness into the painful area. As you learned in \"Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness,\" just thinking of one of your hands increases the blood volume in that hand. Focused thought to other areas of the body can bring about an increased blood volume in those areas as well.

The sense of touch is often overlooked as a source of communication, and yet to the blind, braille has proven to be an invaluable aid in conveying the written word. Braille consists of a code of 63 characters, each made up of one to six raised dot-like bumps arranged in a 6-position matrix or \"cell.\" It has become the universal system of writing and reading for the blind.

Is your left hand or right hand better at discernment? Even though right-handed blind students read better using the center finger of their left hand, they are taught to read braille by using the left index finger for the first half of the written line and the right index finger for the remaining half. Could some sighted, touch-inclined students perform better in school if they were taught to read braille textbooks? Using wooden blocks with letters and numbers, discern all the letters and numbers blindfolded, first with your right, then with your left hand. Have an assistant put various household items in a paper bag for you to handle and identify by touch alone. Using first the right, then the left hand, which is better? Put flour, salt, sugar, sawdust, cornmeal, sand, etc. into various dishes and feel their consistency without looking at them. Take a small handful of dried peas or beans and by touch alone, determine the number. Now look to see how many there are and close your hand and get the 'feel' of that number in your mind.

Next, differentiate with your toes the difference between coarse, medium and fine sandpaper, using each foot. Was your left, or your right foot better able to perceive the tactile differences? Harry Houdini could pick locks with a thin wire and his feet alone! As an exercise at home in your bare feet, separate and close all your toes. Then move each toe individually in turn as best as you can. Practice flushing the toilet, turning on bath tub faucets and picking up dropped objects or pieces of clothing with your toes alone.

In cultures where infant affection is low, levels of violence are high. Twelve times a day the average American woman touches someone. For the average man, it's eight touches. Despite the fact that people like to touch and to be touched, most people are touch illiterates. They think that touching is permissible only in matters of sex and fighting. The more you touch people in a proper way, the more they touch you back. Proper touching can be learned. The vocabulary of touching is transmitted through handshakes, pats, hugs, caresses, rubs, pinches, squeezes, kisses, strokes and brushes. The meanings can reflect simple greetings, affection, fear, sexual desire, etc. Studies have revealed that recipients of even momentary touches in acceptable situations experience positive feelings about themselves and the individuals touching them, but many times they didn't even recall being touched. Sometimes touching is used as a form of manipulation. A young man encounters a young woman who appears to like him, and she reflects this in a touching manner while conversing with him. The toucher has learned that this momentary contact produces good feelings in the recipient, and she plays it for all it is worth. The fond feelings that the young man begins to exhibit are not returned, and confusion results. Understanding how touching affects you is better than misinterpreting it. Through touch, the powerful life energy of a strong, loving person will 'naturally' flow into the field of a weak, low energy person ( see the “life energy” measuring device in the back pages of this book ). When you touch someone with the intention to benefit them, you often evoke similar, positive emotions in them, and a therapeutic effect can result. Dr. Delores Krieger, a professor of nursing at New York University made some breakthroughs with the technique of “laying-on-of-hands,” later known as therapeutic touch . Because there is an exchange of energy through the power of touch, her research showed that patients in hospitals recovered faster when they were touched in a caring way by friends, relatives or nurse attendants. The healing energy exchanged was improved by a more positive attitude of the givers (see “Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health”). Patients were also healed faster when they expressed an abundance of self-love and self-appreciation. One experiment where parents were instructed to massage their newborn babies for 15 minutes every day with slow, pressured stroking resulted after 3 months in babies that were less irritable and with a more even temperament than a group of ba-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  173 bies that did not have the daily massage. A calmer disposition in a baby also brings about automatic self-management in regulating stress hormones of the brain. Often there is an aversion to any touching contact between people because of the concern about maintaining a certain image to onlookers. This phobic behavior should be examined and understood. To learn a better touch vocabulary with people, observe what kind of touches make you feel good and which don't make you feel good. Learn the taboos - don't touch acquaintances or strangers unexpectedly; don't touch friends if interrupting an important activity; don't move or nudge someone aside abruptly; and don't aggressively grab a friend without warning. As an exercise during the following week, each day make some sort of physical contact with people as you talk with them. Use hand shakes, hugs and simple touching contact without discriminating on the basis of sex. Embrace or kiss friends and relatives to say hello and good-bye. Become consciously aware of and use the same kind of gentleness whether you hug men or women. To further accustom yourself with tactile contact, go to a masseur or a masseuse. Exchange massages with friends. Because massage increases the fluid flow in the blood and lymphatic systems, massage shouldn't be used on people with phlebitis, thrombosis, high fevers, infectious diseases, some types of cancers, areas of hemorrhage or heavy tissue damage, and fractures and sprains less than 24 hours old. As a variation to massage, lightly stroke a friend's back and body for 15 minutes and then have them reciprocate. The next opportunity you have for sexual intimacy, choose instead to touch, stroke, hug, bathe and mutually massage each other. The more you understand the language of tactile contact, the more you begin to understand yourself and others."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"174  HEIGHTENED SENSORY Exercise 106 -- Kinesthetic Weight Determination Have you ever picked up two grapefruits that looked alike, but felt like a different weight in each of your hands? The next time you are at a supermarket, practice with such fruits and simply determine for yourself which one is heavier; then confirm it on the weight scale. Using a delicate balancing scale at home, do the same thing with dissimilar, but smaller objects -- matches, pens, pencils, smoking pipes, spoons, etc. Hold one in each hand and ascertain for yourself the weight differences of each object. You'll probably find that the larger, and heavier items are easier to decipher, but practice will allow even the subtle weight differences of smaller objects to be determined as well. Then by feel alone, determine the exact weight of single objects. You can also fill similar glasses with different amounts of water and discern the heaviest to lightest ones with your eyes closed.

Have you ever been near someone seriously unstable and picked up on it even when his or her back was toward you? Even areas of certain cities simply radiate a bad energy around them that is perceivable to some people. You have various energy fields surrounding your body that are directly tied into the beating of your heart. These energies course through you, interacting with body chemistry, and are distributed throughout your body via the 7 subtle energy centers called chakras . By regulating the distance in extending your energy fields, your sensitivity to them and your control over them can be heightened. Sit or lie down in a comfortable, relaxed position and take a few deep, abdominal breaths. Do \"Exercise -- Cleansing Breath For Better Health\" to charge up your body. Then completely relax yourself and tune into the energy radiating from your body ( see the “life energy” measuring device in the back of the book ). Imagine it pulsating in a wave-like action and sense the feeling of it emanating from your body. Now imagine that you are expanding this energy field to about 3 feet from your body. Put your conscious awareness into it and let it flow outward. Gradually expand it some more until it reaches 9 feet from your body. Visualize how this would look and continue to expand it even further to about 15 feet from your body. To assist the process, create an excited, positive, emotional attitude while doing it. Now slowly pull the energy field back to your body in a progressive way, but this time draw it in even closer than it normally would be. To contract the field, create a glum, negative, emotional attitude. Next, relax the energy field contraction and let it go back to its normal size. After practice with this exercise, your awareness of your energy fields will improve as well as your sensitivity to other fields around you. By projecting a stream of energy, a Chinese qigong master can kill, stun or knock someone down from a distance of up to 10 feet away. When masters use their fingertips or hands to relieve pain or heal someone, their energy is temporarily drained afterwards. (\"And Jesus said, somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\" Luke 8:46) The Soviet Nina Kulagina could focus her energy to perform psychokinetic demonstrations -- even to the point of stopping the heart of a frog. There is also fatigue and an energy drain experienced by people after performing psychokinetic feats. Just as your physical body is controlled by your mind, so too is the electromagnet-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"176  HEIGHTENED SENSORY ic energy field surrounding your body directed by the power of your thoughts. Thought precedes your bodily actions -- whether they are gross or subtle. An old magician's \"mind-reading\" trick is to have you think about and concentrate on one of your hands. The magician then subtly holds both of your hands and lightly places one of his fingers on your pulse. Magicians have long known that your blood volume increases markedly in the hand that you are thinking of. Your pulse will first slow down (it seems to skip a beat), and then with a sudden surge, it will throb with more force. Consequently, a distinct difference is discernible by touching the pulses of both wrists, and the \"mind reading\" trick of determining which hand you are thinking about is achieved. Obviously, what applies to the hands also applies to other areas of the body, and what applies to blood flow also applies to other bodily capacities. Light and radio waves are other forms of electromagnetic energy. Various colors in the light spectrum cause distinct reactions in people (see \"Exercise -- Color Significance\"). People exposed to directional radar beams (a form of radio wave) report a 'hearing' sensation described as a buzzing sound in the temporal lobe of the brain. When exposed to radar guns, people test weak kinesiologically for up to 100 yards away (see \"Exercise -- Improve Your Physical Strength in 7 Days\"), so obviously the body is reacting to radar (a form of microwave) on some subtle level. If an emotional message was directed through the radar gun by the person transmitting, could the receiver discern it with enough training? Could radar guns be modified to pulse at frequencies that scramble, disrupt and confuse all those caught in their beams? Perhaps radar guns could be further modified to immobilize or stun a charging bull in full stride, or a running felon for that matter? Could pulsed, focused beams from simple radar guns be keyed to a desired frequency for a desired effect? Besides electromagnetic energy, many people accumulate 10,000 to 20,000 volts of static electricity while walking across a deep pile carpet on a dry day. Electrostatic instruments can measure this energy via the cloud of ions (charged particles) surrounding the human body. Some people are \"allergic\" to electrostatic fields and react very strongly to them. On the other hand, Pauline Shaw of Manchester, England accumulates so much static electricity in her body that she blows out electrical appliances with just a touch. This electrostatic energy may also be partially responsible for establishing the initial stages of psychokinesis (see \"Exercise -- Psychokinesis\") in some people. Psychokinetic Nina Kulagina for instance could easily light up fluorescent lights with her static discharge."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  177 Exercise 108 -- Electromagnetic Tactile Discernment Your body has electromagnetic lines called meridians along which acupuncture points lie. Inextricably interwoven with these lines are the electromagnetic energy fields encompassing your body. Before doing this exercise, do \"Exercise -- Concentration to Relieve Stress\" to prepare the mind for clearer perception. Sit in a relaxed position and face a partner with your palms extended over theirs, but not touching them. Direct your conscious awareness to your palms and discern the energy exchange there. No doubt some of the warmth you feel will be the body temperature of your partner's hands, but there are other energies perceivable as well. As an exercise in detecting the subtle disruptions in the body's electromagnetic field, practice with closed eyes putting your hands 2 or 3 inches over a noticeably affected part (broken bone, cut, bruise, aching joint, etc.) of another person's body and discern what it feels like to you. When a part of the body is malfunctioning, a disruption in the energy field is present and instead of radiating healthy energy, it absorbs energy. With practice, even undetected internal problems of people can be discerned in this way. Many nurses in medical centers across the country are using a form of intentional healing called noncontact therapeutic touch (NCTT) to relieve their patients' pain, reduce swelling and fever, heal wounds faster and help bone fractures mend in less time. Such healers glide their hands in the air over the patient's body until the afflicted area is located; then pausing over the area, the healer focuses on healing thoughts to return it to a normal, balanced state. After intuitively tuning into their patients' electromagnetic field patterns, these healers adjust their own currents to produce resonant patterns. When two physical systems possess the same resonant frequency, healing information can be exchanged (review \"Exercise -- Electromag- netic Field Awareness\"). Replenishing depleted areas in the energy field or smooth- ing out ill-flowing areas can all help to balance a patient’s body and allow it to heal itself. Like homeostasis, the energy of a strong, vital person flows 'naturally' into the body of a weak, sickly person upon close contact, so everyone has the power to heal to some degree (see \"Exercise -- Learning the Language of Touch\"). For NCTT to be most effective, a healer must assume a relaxed, meditative state where alpha/theta brain wave frequencies (4 - 13 cycles per second) predominate. Synchronizing your brain wave frequency to the earth's resonant frequency (7.5 -7.83 cycles per second) produces the greatest clarity and amplitude for the transmission of your thought inten-"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"178  HEIGHTENED SENSORY tion. In a controlled experiment, where healers treated 2 groups of people, one where they mentally focused their attention to healing and the other where they only did mental arithmetic in their minds, only the group treated with healing thoughts showed any improvement. For an interesting effect, relax your mind and place your left hand over a partner's head (for soothing, healing energy), and your right hand at the back of their neck (for strength). Think only healing, loving thoughts, and have your partner keep a recep- tive or at least neutral state of mind. After 60 seconds, ask your partner how they feel after this treatment? To take advantage of your natural abilities, experiment with a friend who has a headache. Using both your hands, stand behind your friend and place your thumbs above their ears and your fingers under their ear lobes, but keeping the ears exposed. Gently, but firmly clutch the back of their head for 15 - 30 seconds without letting your fingers touch. Maintain a relaxed and positive state of mind while you do this technique. The polarized balance you achieve for your friend should be enough to relieve their headache. To balance and free yourself from certain aches and pains, put your left hand across your forehead while placing your right thumb in your navel and your small finger on your pubic bone. This creates a balanced magnetic connection. Relax, close your eyes and think 'healing' thoughts for about 3 to 5 minutes. You should now feel energized and considerably pain-free. To balance your dog's electromagnetic field and relieve him of certain pains and ailments, place your left hand on your pets chest, between the front and back legs while you place your right hand on the back of your dog's neck. Relax yourself and think healing thoughts for a few minutes or until your dog indicates he's had enough. Your right hand gives strength and your left hand soothes and heals. Since your magnetic field is stronger than your pet's, results should come easily. For a different exercise, have a partner move behind you to within one foot of your body. Identify to yourself how this feels to you. Now allow your conscious awareness to move up and down your back to pick up and become aware of any subtle changes in heat or magnetic flux. Now consciously project with emotion your electromagnetic energy field toward the person behind you! Notice the difference in perception? Now blindfolded, experiment with your partner's hand moving over various parts of your body within 2 inches of contact. Can you tell where his hand is moving?

Attaching small magnets to pigeons on cloudy days disrupted their steering mechanism, but on sunny days they were able to counter the magnet's effects with celestial navigation. Even humans have displayed a magnetic sensing ability enabling them to tune into the earth's magnetic field. Electricity and magnetism are co-related, so where we can use an electroencephalogram (EEG) to reflect electrical brain wave output, we can also use a magneto-encephalogram (MEG) to distinguish the brain's magnetic waves. The weak magnetic field in the human head is represented by lines of force that go from the left hemisphere of the brain around the head and back into the right hemisphere. The massive Olmec stone heads of ancient Mexico show signs of once being decorated with magnetite stones, presumably representative of their creators' knowledge of human reactions to magnetic fields. Between 1976 and 1978, studies at Manchester University in England revealed that blindfolded students had an uncanny sensing 'instinct' for home. In fact, the homing accuracy was greater the farther the students were taken from home (tested up to 48 miles distance). On the other hand, when bar magnets were placed in helmets on their heads, disorientation resulted; whereas control groups with brass bars instead of magnets in their helmets maintained their homing instinct successfully. As an exercise, and as a good demonstration of your body's reaction to the earth's magnetic field, simply stretch out your arms on each side of your body and slowly rotate your body 360° while noting the sensation in your fingers and palms. Since your hands are of opposite polarity (right hand is positive & left hand is negative), the line of connection can be sensed between one hand and the other as you rotate through the north/south axis and even quite strongly between the east/west directions as well. Identify words, images and feelings to describe each direction so that the next time you face that direction you can recognize what it feels like again. After discerning what the sensations feel like in the different directions, it becomes obvious that the human body standing vertically can act like a magnetic compass as it reacts to the earth's magnetic field. To further improve your magnetic abilities, work with another person who has a bar magnet with a strength of at least 2,000 gauss. Blindfold yourself and have your partner use the N pole and bring it close to your head in different locations, keeping the magnet moving in small circles to improve"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  181 perception. You then indicate what part of your head the magnet is located. Use the S pole next in the same way. You will soon find that with practice, each side of the head will have a discernibly different feeling between using the 2 poles. If the N pole is placed at the right ear for instance, a kinesiological test of an indicator muscle will show weak (review \"Exercise -- Improve Your Physical Strength in 7 Days\"). This effect does not occur if the S pole of the magnet is tested at the same point. The opposite is true with the other ear. Since there appears to be magnetite in human blood, try hyperventilating for a few minutes to raise the pH level. The magnetite in the blood will rotate its resonance and your sensitivity to magnetism will often increase with this method. With practice, your north-south orientation abilities will improve markedly from here. Once you acknowledge and understand your sensing abilities, your overall sensitivity to magnetic fields will always be with you as an additional skill. To illustrate how your body's energy field reacts to pain, have a friend lie on his back on the floor. Now suspend an ordinary magnetic compass a few inches above the solar plexus region of his body. If the person is given pain, as in a severe pinch, the compass needle will deflect considerably. Give your friend a guided visualization where he imagines himself suddenly falling off a ladder and hitting a pavement, and a similar reaction on the compass will be registered if his imagery is vivid enough. He may even tell you that he felt a twinge in his solar plexus as well, when he visualized the action."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"182  HEIGHTENED SENSORY Exercise 110 -- Improving Peripheral Vision Awareness The eye's fovea is a small spot near the retina's center filled with a high concen- tration of photoreceptors that allows the focal point of your vision to guide visual information to the conscious thinking part of your brain; but the fovea receives only a small part of the visual information entering the eye. The parafovea is an area that surrounds the fovea and can take in much more. The parafoveal cells are connected to other areas of the brain that govern reflexive or \"instinctive\" responses. To illustrate this, have a partner hold a dollar bill by its end with his thumb and forefinger. Place your thumb and forefinger in about the middle of the dollar bill in an open, ready position. When your friend lets the dollar bill go without warning, close your thumb and forefinger upon it as quickly as possible. Was it too fast for you? Now do the same experiment, but this time don't look at the dollar bill with your focal vision. Look at it by projecting your conscious awareness into your peripheral vision. Did you catch it this time? Were your reflexes better? Most of the visual information that hits the parafovea is subliminal information (beyond the conscious threshold), but it doesn't always have to be that way. As an exercise, focus your eyes on a single point on the wall. Now without looking away, allow your conscious awareness to wander away from the focal point of your vision and become aware of what is to the left of your focal point by about two feet. Now rotate your conscious awareness above your focal point; then to the right; then to the bottom. Now let it wander freely to the maximum in all directions. Next, sweep your conscious awareness in a circular, spiral motion around and into your focal point and then back out to the extremes again. Interesting, isn't it? Your parafoveal cells have now been put to conscious use. (Those people that are cross-eyed do this every day as a matter of necessity.) Choose another point in the room and again fixate your gaze toward a certain spot and hold it there. Identify the furniture, various objects large and small, and the different colors that are surrounding your focal point. How did you do? Spatial relationships are better understood by the right brain, so items to the left of your focal point will probably be easier to discern at first, but with practice, both sides will improve. Now hold both your index fingers out in front of you. Move your right hand in an arcing motion to the left while moving your left hand to the right. Let your focal vision follow one finger while your conscious awareness follows the other finger. Reverse it. Which direction was easier?

Take a shuffled deck of cards and while fixating your focal gaze at a point on the wall, hold each card one by one at some point in your peripheral field of vision. Identify each card and stretch the discerning ability of your peripheral vision to its limit. By mastering these different exercises, you'll eventually find it difficult to miss anything that's within your entire visual view. Since training your peripheral vision to consciously apprehend information directly involves the parafovea, your speed reading skills will greatly improve as well.

U nder red light, focal vision is sharp and clear, but peripheral vision is poor. Under blue light, peripheral vision is better and focal vision is blurred. Perhaps this can explain why magicians claim to see certain blue-tinted nail polish marks on the backs of cards with their peripheral vision, but can't see the same marks with their focal vision. If 2 simultaneously flashing lights are shown, the one viewed with your focal vision will appear to flash ahead of the one you view with your peripheral vision. This is because the foveal cells are connected to the cerebral cortex (the conscious thinking area), and the parafoveal cells of your peripheral vision lead to your reflex brain areas. Certain sports like football, basketball and hockey require acute peripheral vision for superior performance (passing the ball, avoiding on rushers, etc.). Baseball and tennis players keep their focal vision on the ball as they use their peripheral vision and kinesthetic awareness to guide the bat or racket to the ball. Also, by avoiding tunnel vision and using your peripheral vision while driving your car, many accidents can safely be avoided. For an exercise drill, pick up objects, trace mazes, draw pictures, play chess, dial a phone and light a candle using only your peripheral vision.

For example, even a blinded chameleon will take on the coloration of its environment. Human eyes are simply highly differentiated skin cells. They are the organs through which vision normally functions, but a different kind of vision is also possible with non- specialized skin cells. Blind people, for example, can usually detect the existence of light even when infrared and ultraviolet energy are largely excluded. This radiation sensing process can even be extended to discern individual wavelengths of different colors. The Soviet Rosa Kuleshova taught herself to distinguish colors, read print and discern movements with her skin alone. Examined by hard-nosed scientists, Rosa, while blindfolded read newsprint and sheet music under glass with her fingertips! She could identify the color and shape of patches of light projected onto her palms, and could even read the small print of a newspaper with her elbow. Professor K.B. Duke took the stage name Kuda Bux and astounded many people in the U.S. with his blindfold vision performances. He explained that his talent was self-taught and that it took him 11 years to master it. After placing lumps of dough over his eyes and covering them with wool bandage, Bux could read books, move through an obstacle course and even ride a bicycle. T his phenomenon is not new, for there have been many recorded instances of 'skin seeing' among the sighted as well as the blind. In fact, children from ages 4 to 12 are especially sensitive to training in this ability. The Instituda Mas Vida in Mexico City was featured several years ago on the TV show “You Asked For It,” and they illustrated several children reading and replicating various kinesthetic movements while blindfolded! Colors have different electromagnetic frequencies and interact with the body in different ways. The colors of your clothes and objects in your immediate environment have led to a whole new field of color psychology. Blindfolded students that have learned to discern colors have indicated that there are distinct textures that are more or less different to the touch. Yellow feels very slippery; red is sticky; green is stickier than red, but not as coarse; dark blue is the stickiest. Light blue feels the smoothest; orange has a rough, coarse and braking feel; violet has even a greater braking effect on the fingers. Black is the most sticky, viscid and braking of all. White is smooth though coarser than yellow to the touch. Even when colored papers are in trays, students can learn to feel the effects in the air above the colors.

Blind students can learn the color of lights on their skin in 1 to 3 weeks, while sighted students may take up to twice as long. Some students can distinguish colored shapes under a glass plate, with triangles more easily identifiable than circles or squares. (The glass usually has to be under one-sixteenth of an inch thick.) As an exercise to begin distinguishing colors with your skin, purchase various colors of construction paper that all have the same texture grain. Test yourself with your eyes closed as to whether you can distinguish any differences. Now just as you shifted your conscious awareness into your peripheral vision in the \"Exercise -- Improving Peripheral Vision Awareness,\" shift your conscious awareness to your fingertips for optimal discernment. About 10% of people tested have been found to have an already existing color-distinguishing ability. (Kinesthetic people learn this ability faster than visual and auditory people.) Now assume a comfortable position. Gradually relax all your muscles, from your toes to your head and slowly do some deep, abdominal breathing (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation\" and all the breathing exercises). Working with color pairs at first, have a partner alternately give you black and then white sheets of paper for starters; then red and green sheets and so on. While blindfolded, lightly touch and feel each paper; then feel the air just above it. After daily practice at attempting to perceive the colors with your 'sensing' ability, greater accuracy will finally take place. Make a game of it. Distinguish the difference between magazine pictures of men and women. Use pictures of single objects and shapes. Use flash cards of letters of the alphabet. After continual practice, an intuitive knowingness develops that is hard to describe, and your mind will begin receiving the correct images. Now look at and impress certain items in the room with your mind. Close your eyes and retain the vision for as long was you can -- not as an after-image, but imaginatively. Practice with furniture, maps, pictures, flowers and other objects. Continual diligence and practice will bring about a 'seeing' on another level, but it might take weeks, months or years to develop the ability fully. Scatter small objects (spoons, forks, pencils, erasers, matches, etc.) on a table in front of you. Look at them and then close your eyes.

In other words, as our instrumentation improves, we're beginning to measure and explain things that formerly were mysteries. Under hypnosis, people proceed much faster in the training process of finger and skin perception, because they accept the power of suggestion and believe they can do it. It also has been found that if your finger temperature is down to around 70° - 75°F, your perception is off a bit. If your finger temperature is over 90°F and the colored construction paper is at room temperature, your perception is heightened (review \"Exercise -- Seeing With Your Skin & Body\"). In fact, experiments reveal that the greater the difference between the temperature of the hand and the temperature of the object, the better the result. For a simple exercise, paint one side of an aluminum square black and put it into the freezer. Drop the temperature of the plate to about 40°F. Now while blindfolded have an assistant let you feel the air just above the black painted side without touching it. Now feel the air just above the unpainted side.

Choose a location where disturbances are minimal and the people can be fed and housed for the night. In the beginning, only blindfold the people for a few hours at a time to get them used to visual deprivation. Give them snacks or breaks during these interims, then cover their eyes with the blindfolds again. In the early stages, most of the people will move around with great caution, adding an occasional stumble or bump now and then. Soon afterwards, a distorted sense of time develops along with a changing perception of where the walls and furniture in the room are situated. At this point, sound, touch and fragrances become necessary tools in determining your orientation. Since normally about 80% of all your sensory input is visual, that 80% has to now shift to your other senses. Several hours through the exercise, you begin to move about with greater speed. Twilight glimmers of the outside world and the people around the room begin to unlock your inner perceptions of awareness. Have the people sleep blindfolded, and on the second day, eat blindfolded as well. You will begin to experience on the second day an awareness through vibrations. Objects, furniture and walls seem to announce themselves upon approach. Movements outside among the trees and shrubs also become surer and quicker as the realm of vibrational sight expands itself. It must be mentioned here that it is extremely important to have the right guide during this exercise, for feelings of panic and helplessness can easily invade your consciousness. Also, if you have had a problem with mental instability, this exercise is not recommended.

The 'corona' of the human body is the etheric body, and most people can see it with only a little practice. It is the forerunner of the aura, but of a coarser consistency. One way to see it is to get a willing partner to extend a bare arm. Have their fingers outspread a few inches away from some neutral or black background. Look towards the arm and the fingers, not directly at it, but towards it. You'll soon find there is a particular knack at focusing on the background through your fingers, but seeing them with your peripheral vision. Close to the skin will be seen a bluish or grayish haze that will extend from 1/8 of an inch to maybe 6 inches from the body. Relax and don't strain the process, and pretty soon you'll see there really is something there. A nother way to see the etheric body is to practice on yourself. Sit comfortably about 6 feet from a blank wall. Relax and take several deep, abdominal breaths. Extend your arms to full length and place your finger tips together with the thumbs up. Now part your fingertips slowly to about 1/4 of an inch and you will see something like a gray mist that is almost luminous. If you draw your fingers apart by another 1/4 of an inch, you'll discern the etheric body more noticeably. Keep practicing the touching and parting until you see \"something.\" It's just a matter of practice. When you get good at it, you'll notice that it flows from either the left hand to the right hand or from the right to the left. This flow depends not only on your sex, but on your state of health as well as your thoughts at the time. Now alternate the flow back and forth with your thoughts. Another technique is to extend one index finger vertically away from your eyes and look at it. Then put your other index finger in front of the first. Begin moving the back index finger away from you slowly while focusing on its movement. After reaching arm's length, begin slowly moving it back to the first finger. Repeat the process, but this time focus on the moving finger, while directing your conscious awareness to the ghost finger (review \"Exercise -- Improving Your Peripheral Vision Awareness\"). Do this several times. Now reverse your hands, and repeat the process. Afterwards, close your eyes and visualize in your mind's eye this back and forth, 2-finger process. By practicing these drills, seeing the etheric body will come quickly and easily."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"192  HEIGHTENED SENSORY Exercise 116 -- Aura Seeing An aura is a vibrational energy surrounding every material object. Your health, personality, spirituality and past lives are reflected in your aura. Just as some people can hear sounds beyond the normal range of hearing and into the infrasonic and ultrasonic levels, other people can see a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The aura is made up of several layers of varying density, and is the reflector of the soul. Your aura swirls as a colorful vibrational encasement around you several feet thick, and it is a finer representation of your electromagnetic field than your etheric body. The higher your spiritual development and the better your health, the purer and more vibrantly brilliant your aura is. The darker or duller the aura, the more spiritually, mentally and physically imbalanced or unhealthy you are. When you are desperately ill, your aura begins to fade -- and in most cases, fades out completely before you die. You cannot fake your aura. Your aura denotes your true nature and personality, and when you lie, a greenish-yellow flare shoots through the halo at the top of your aura. Usually people have one or two dominating colors (strong points) in their aura. These colors will more than likely be their favorite colors as well. Black clouds indicate hatred and malice. Deep red displays anger. Blood red signifies sensuality. Dull brown is associated with avarice and materialism, and grayish brown indicates selfishness. Greenish brown means jealousy. Gray signifies depression and fear. Orange indicates ambition, pride, inspiration and a sign of power. Yellow is associated with joy, freedom, intellect and the qualities of spiritual knowledge. Grayish green in the aura reveals deceit and cunning. Emerald green displays ingenuity and versatility. Turquoise indicates a quality of being highly energized and influencing. Such people can do many things at once and are good organizers. The hue of pale green denotes sympathy, compassion and a basic healing attitude. Dark blue and purple indicates spiritual thoughts and feelings. Pink indicates that a person has achieved a balance between spiritual awareness and material existence. Light blue reveals a dedication to high ideals. White is the epitome of perfection. M ost young children (up to 5 years of age) see auras naturally, because their foveal vision has not yet been desensitized. Children also have more vibrant and stronger auras than most adults, who are heavily influenced by the sensory and materialistic world. If children were encouraged at their young age to continue seeing auras and to learn about them, they would not loose this natural ability."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  193 To see an aura, you need to increase the sensitivity of your eyes and extend the range of perceived vibration beyond the visible light. Part of improving your auric sight is improving your peripheral vision, so master both “Exercise -- Improving Your Peripheral Vision Awareness” and “Exercise -- Using Your Peripheral Vision” before attempting to do the following exercise. As an eye exercise, construct a chart using black and white pieces of construction paper. Start with a 15-inch square of black paper, and place over it a 14-inch square of white paper, then a 13-inch black piece and so on every inch down to the center. Place the chart at eye level (from a seated position) on a wall in a well lit room. Assume a relaxed, comfortable, seated position about 6 feet from the chart. Now look at the center and mentally imagine the chart zooming towards you as if it were in motion. If done properly, the chart will appear like you are looking down the interior of a tunnel. Next, visualize the chart moving away from you until it appears back to normal again. Since the muscles of your eyes are responding to this zooming effect, there could be some fatigue. Therefore, do this exercise for no longer than 10 to 15 minutes at a time, but practice every day. If you wear glasses, keep them on, but understand that your vision may improve with this exercise. Caution: Only do this exercise in a clear, positive frame of mind and you will have the additional benefit of having that feeling intensified afterwards. The con- centric squares have a psychotronic effect of amplifying your vibrations like stacked pyramids (see \"Exercise -- Psionic and Psychotronic Generators\"). To train your eyes to see the auric rainbow in the ultraviolet area of the spectrum, an exaggerated stimulation of the rods and cones of your parafovea (the retinal cells of your peripheral vision) can be achieved with blue and red filters. By looking at the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"194  HEIGHTENED SENSORY sky for several minutes through a dicyanin (blue) filter, your peripheral vision is sen- sitized to the shorter wavelengths of blue and violet, and the longer red and orange wavelengths are eliminated. Looking through red goggles accustoms your sight to night vision and dim light. A red filter permits the cones of the eyes (primarily in the fovea) to function, but leaves the rods (primarily in the parafovea) inactive and ready to see in dim light when the goggles are removed. Opposite each primary color is its complementary color. Cyan (bluish-green) is the complement of red. When you stare at red for a while, and look at a white surface, your eyes will see its complementary color of bluish-green more easily. Your eyes have tired of red. Since fatiguing the eyes with red produces bluish-green after images, seeing the ultraviolet range of auras is more accentuated against a white or light neutral background. Blue and violet rays are seen better by the rods of the eyes than by the cones. In near darkness, the focal vision of the fovea is nearly absent. Vision shifts from the high concentration of cones in the fovea to the high concentration of rods in the parafovea. (You might even experiment with goggles where one lens is blue and one is red to see what affect it has on your vision as a dual after-image!?) Now go to the bathroom and take off all your clothes. Relax and begin breathing in a connected way to supercharge your system with oxygen (see \"Exercise -- Connected Breathing For Increased Energy\"). Now stand or sit in front of a large mirror and look at yourself. Use a white wall or a black curtain behind you for a neutral background. Use a dim or subdued light at first, because the sensitivity of your peripheral vision to the blue end of the spectrum is increased (see \"Exercise -- Using Your Peripheral Vision\"). Look at the point above and between the eyes for a few minutes without looking away, and allow your eyes to adjust to the dim light (like going into a dark theater). With your peripheral vision, your should begin to see that the background near your head is brighter and has a different color than the background further away. Can you begin to see a bluish alcohol-like flame around your temples, arms and hips? When you see that, you're beginning to make progress in seeing your aura. The longer you concentrate, the better you can see it. Concentrating on one spot increases the sensitivity of your eyes. Practice at least 10 to 15 minutes per day to develop your sensitivity to seeing auras better. By letting your eyes go \"out of focus\", you can sometimes see auras around people or street lights at dusk or at night, but as soon as you realize you're seeing the aura and focus in on it, it fades.

Thus, various forms of stimuli in your environment go totally unnoticed. So-called people with 'one track' minds are most effective at doing this. The more 'multi-aware' you are, the more concentration is necessary to shut down your other senses. Concentration is a relaxed focusing of you attention in one area without being brought back to another area desiring shutdown. One New York dentist distracts his patients from experiencing pain by having them concentrate on adjusting the volume and tuning of a certain station on a radio headset while he is drilling their teeth. In the middle of a football game, a player may sustain a painful injury, but only become 'aware' of it after the concentration on the activity subsides! T hrough hypnosis, it has been shown that one or more of your senses can be temporarily shut down, but there are other techniques that can accomplish the same thing without hypnosis. To have the sense of feeling disappear in your arm, stroke the skin on the back of your one hand and arm with the fingers of your other hand, while suggesting that the sensation of feeling disappear. Stop after about a minute; then repeat the process. Practice this exercise for 5 one-minute trials per day, and soon the suggestion will become so real that a pin stuck into your skin will not be felt. Hold an object in front of you, and bring your conscious awareness into focusing your total attention to it. Notice small details, scratches or imperfections about it. What makes it different from other objects? Question yourself about it and don't allow any distractions to interrupt your thought. Do this exercise for about 60 seconds, and you'll notice your sense of hearing go dormant. With practice, you'll be able to read in the noisiest environment without distraction. Next, stare at a spot in the room and simply listen to all the different sounds filling the atmosphere. Key in on each one and question yourself about them. Conjure up a mental picture about the originator of each sound. In about 60 seconds, you'll notice your vision go dormant. Sometimes this happens while reading. Daydreaming starts and an awareness of the reading material ceases. To cut off hearing and vision, concentrate your attention (which doesn't mean grimacing with a tense frown on your face) in a relaxed way on an inner mental image of what your room looked like as a child, seeing as much detail and clarity as possible while inhaling slowly to the count of five.

Most people conduct their daily activities without consciously 'attending' to many physical or mental processes. It's not laziness, it’s just that you’ve practiced it more and it’s just easier. You drive a car without thinking of shifting the gears. You brush your teeth, comb your hair, eat your food, walk to the house and do daily chores all automatically. When you attend to the pressure of your foot against the floor or to the sound of a whistle in the distance, you are consciously aware and focused on it. You can also be mindful of the taste in your mouth, an odor in the air or even an inner thought process. If you focus your attention to a spot on the wall, you can even direct your conscious awareness to various points around that spot without shifting the focal point of your gaze (see \"Exercise -- Improving Your Peripheral Vision Awareness\"). When listening to an orchestra, you can attend to the entire musical piece or you can 'flash' your conscious awareness to pick out and separate each musical instrument for individual attention (see \"Exercise -- A Multiple Hearing Acuity\"). In the beginning when a blind man is learning to read braille, his conscious awareness is intently focused on interpreting with his fingertips the dot-like bumps into an intelligible language. After sufficiently learning braille, the process becomes 'automatic' and it no longer has to be consciously attended to. A 'shift' from the consciously attentive area of the brain to other areas of the brain is made, and the newly learned activity is fully integrated as a mastered language experience. Learning the Morse code or sign language or tap dancing or speed reading or bicycle riding -- all take conscious attention in the beginning. Later these skills simply become 'automatic,' and a 'knowingness' that cannot be fully explained is achieved. Through a more thorough hemispheric integration, you're able to consciously attend to a more varied environment which in turn stimulates and helps your brain grow. W hen you consciously attend to a certain activity, an increased blood flow is conducted into the brain area governing that activity. An increase in blood flow brings about more oxygen to that brain area, and consequent electrical activity brings about neuronal growth. Your conscious awareness is not something tangible, but you know when you're using it, don't you? It's like the 4th dimensional trigger of the mind which can activate the brain cells into use. Sometimes your conscious awareness can become so completely absorbed in an"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"200  HEIGHTENED SENSORY activity that other sensory input goes unnoticed (review \"Exercise -- Closing Off One of Your Senses\"). In this way, an injury to a football player can go unnoticed by him until after the game, or a child watching TV can fail to 'hear' a parent's voice. At certain times, concentrating on a dripping water faucet can be irritating, and at other times it can go unnoticed. Learning how to open up your conscious awareness or to close it voluntarily simply takes practice like everything else. T here is a 'linger effect' of several seconds that takes place in the human brain when sensory input can be acknowledged or not acknowledged. For instance, when you speak to someone who is concentrating on a certain activity and doesn't appear to have heard you, nudge them within 4 seconds and ask them if they heard you. Usually they'll say, \"Yes, I heard you\" and they'll be able to remember what you said. If you wait much longer and ask them whether they heard you, they'll usually say, \"No.\" The lag time for recall was too long. Taking advantage of this lag time of recall and quickly flashing your conscious awareness to various tasks can enable you to perform simultaneous mental functions. When certain skills are learned thoroughly enough and the shift to other areas of the brain is made, this split second flashing of your conscious attention is not as necessary. Like your body's muscles, your mind must be exercised and used more if it is expected to grow. Improving your mindfulness allows you to savor each stage of your development far better than you normally would in a non-mindful state. As an exercise in expanding your conscious awareness, practice flashing it quickly from distant sounds TO the touch of your clothes against your skin TO the salivary taste in your mouth TO your breathing in and out TO your seeing with your peripheral vision TO the odors in the air TO a visualization of a giant number 3. Now flash your conscious awareness to the subtler sensory input you are receiving, the external temperature, the barometric pressure on your skin and nostrils, the beating of your heart, faint odors and sounds, the specific emotion you are feeling, etc. Finally, open yourself up to the total awareness picture and drink it all in simultaneously. Do this exercise frequently during the day, jumping from one sensory stimulus to another as rapidly as you can, but get more conscious about your day. Can you remember what you were thinking about when you awoke this morning or when you retired the night before? At the end of your day, review all the events that happened to you during the preceding 12 hours and up to your present point. If there are gaps in your memory, you can improve your performance by making end- of-the-hour reviews throughout the day on what you did during each hour. With"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"   HEIGHTENED SENSORY  201 practice this should take only seconds to accomplish. Being more mindful about a vacation or other important events in the future will give you a better recall about those experiences later. For additional practice, ask yourself throughout a normal day why you are doing what you are doing. Are you operating “on automatic” or do you think about actions before you do them? Remember - frequent forgetfulness and inattention go hand in hand. B eing mindful when you are lustful, fearful, angry or pleasure oriented tends to give the emotion a transformed feeling! Ask yourself questions about the emotion you are experiencing to gain a total awareness of it. When you embrace one of these basic emotions with your conscious awareness, you will find it becomes better understood and actually changes itself into one of the more peaceful emotions. Another drill in getting more conscious is to estimate what the exact time is throughout the day before looking at your watch. Then confirm the real time by looking at your watch. There is a clock in your head that can eventually allow you to do this very well. As an additional drill, pretend that thieves are everywhere and that you must be consciously aware of all your belongings & personal effects and their positions in your house and on your person. This will keep you on your toes for the day. As a drill in being more mindful, constantly switch your handedness throughout your day. Practice smelling, seeing, hearing, tasting and feeling with conscious discernment. The next 7 things you do, ask yourself why you are doing them that way and not some other way. The more you perform these and other drills of your own invention, the better able you are to control your actions and remember those actions afterwards. As a final exercise, be totally mindful of every activity you perform throughout your next normal day. Keeping yourself totally attentive is a matter of noticing exactly what you are doing at the exact moment that you are doing it. By witnessing intently every action you make -- standing, stretching, sitting -- you become mindful of yourself without purposefully changing your actions or placing judgmental values on what you are doing. By this total mindfulness of the moment, your development of your total personal awareness is definitely increased. By observing such awareness, you can increase your efficiency and decrease certain energy wastes."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"202  HEIGHTENED SENSORY"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Multi-Tasking Section"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"   MULTI-TASKING  203 Exercise 120 -- Simultaneous Motor Coordination Most people realize that they can see, smell, hear, taste and touch simultaneously, but examining closely how you attend to each of these functions, you discover that your conscious awareness is limited (see \"Exercise -- Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness\"). In the beginning stages of learning a new task, the cortex crackles with electrical impulses and an increased blood flow. After the task has become sufficiently learned, the action no longer needs your conscious awareness to attend to it. The new neural pathways are established, and electrical activity and blood flow are reduced. Perhaps a subconscious awareness takes over, but a multiple brain functioning can now be accomplished with the new learned activity while maintaining only a flashing back and forth of the conscious awareness to reflect upon what is going on. Tap dancing, typing on a typewriter and playing the piano all had to be consciously attended to when first learned, but later became 'automatic' enough that talking and listening at the same time provided little problem. Learning certain motor coordinated skills can often assist you in seemingly unrelated areas. In one experiment, when kittens were deprived of the motor movement of walking after birth, they became perceptually blind! Apparently, a stimulated motor center is needed to activate a cat's visual brain center. When children are deprived of the motor movement of crawling in infancy and put into walkers, some forms of dyslexia often result. Later if the crawling patterns are eventually practiced, normal reading can often develop. As an exercise, do the childhood game where you rub your stomach and pat your head simultaneously. Now rub your head in a clockwise direction and pat your stomach. Then make the rubbing motion in a counterclockwise direction while patting with the other hand. Now do it while singing a favorite tune, quoting a familiar verse, saying the ABC's or the 2's table or inwardly visualizing various animals at the zoo. Practice adding on your other senses as you do this and become aware of the odors in the room, the sounds outside and the tactile feeling of the rubbing and patting motions --- and all simultaneously by flashing your conscious awareness back and forth. Practice throughout the day other tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand while doing circular motions with the right hand and inwardly visualizing the events of the day.

Then reverse your hands and do a counterclockwise movement for the one, and a clockwise movement for the other. S ince you might have trouble with these movements at first, stand up and do a cross lateral marching movement to help balance the two hemispheres and alleviate the blockage you're experiencing. From a standing position, simply raise your left arm and right leg simultaneously, then raise your right arm and left leg simultaneously, and continue this marching movement for 12 times on each side. Afterwards rotate your hands the way you did before to see the improvement. Now stand up straight and get relaxed. Begin this next drill by swiveling your arms and hips back and forth together. Next, swing your arms and hips in opposite directions, then together again, then in opposite directions. Now turn your head in the same direction as your arms are swinging, then in opposite directions. After mastering this combination, move your eyes in the same direction as your head, then move them in the opposite direction. Now combine all the movements while jumping up and down. Next, snap your fingers at the same time while doing all the rest. With practice, these drills will give you more fluidity of thought and intention with a deeper sense of competence and serenity. A hemispheric synchronization and holistic use of the brain is achieved. But beware, there is a natural resistance to these exercises, because they require effort.

After the motor skill becomes 'automatic,' conversing with someone at the same time provides no problem. Also, writing mirror language (see \"Exercise -- Writing Mirror Language\") with your left hand (right brain) while conversing simultaneously (left brain) is far easier than writing normal script with your right hand and conversing at the same time, because both functions tend to interfere with each other on the left side of the brain. To facilitate his creation of musical compositions, Mozart often asked his wife to read to him so he could more freely think out the musical notes in his head. Mozart was unaware of hemispheric brain functions, but he did know this procedure helped him. As a priming exercise, take a sheet of paper and write 50 four-letter words backwards. This gets the mind looking more completely at words and also sharpens your inner visualization process as well. Now begin writing the 4-letter words backwards from memory as you recite the alphabet, a favorite poem, the 2's table, the 3's table, the 5's table or sing a familiar tune. Next, say the alphabet backwards or with transposed letters (see \"Exercise -- Alphabet Gymnastics\"), while writing 4- letter words backwards.

Insurance statistics verify that there is a higher percentage of people who have auto accidents with telephones in the car than people with cars that don’t have phones! Splitting one’s attention between conversing on the phone and driving can be a little difficult for people. Increasing your overall awareness is important. If different words are simultaneously played through a headset to the left and right ears, you tend to hear and report better those words heard by the right ear (left brain). If different, non-speech sounds are played into both ears, the left ear (right brain) tends to acknowledge the sound better. To avoid having a sensory overload when two people are talking to you at once, practice listening to the radio and TV at the same time, or two radios or two TV's. Discern each conversation individually and get the gist of what is being said from both inputs. Translators at the United Nations often listen and translate simultaneously. Traffic control operators who guide airplanes with airport radar become very good at discerning simultaneous conversations coming in through their headsets. It's a matter of life or death for many passengers. Behind a closed door, pick out the different human voices conversing at a party in the next room. You'll probably find it easy to discern the voices of family members and close friends, but have more difficulty with voices you've heard only a few times. Listen for the pitch, the inflection, the pattern, and the tempo of the voice. Pick up on the idiosyncrasies -- clearing of the throat, sniffling, stuttering, etc. Seat yourself in a room where conversations are going on and close your eyes. Flash rapidly from one conversation to another, getting the flow of each by picking up key words and ideas. Now converse with someone while listening to a conversation behind you. With practice, this ability will become a lot of fun and you'll find that you'll miss very little of what's going on around you. Practice this in a restaurant with a friend or while walking down a city street.

The loud noises of guns, rock music and big machinery all can obliterate ear neurons. Can being more conscious of sounds improve auditory acuity? One researcher found that those people who enjoy loud music or \"attend\" more to it suffer less hearing loss from it than those who don't enjoy it. By directing your conscious awareness to a finely tuned listening discernment, there is a more refined usage of the ears, and corresponding brain centers governing the ears. To assume that because you have ears, you are listening and attending to sound is just as absurd as to assume that because you have a brain, you are thinking. Both skills are learned with practice. If neither ear or brain cells are put to much use, naturally their rate of deterioration will be increased with their corresponding lack of use. Since about 80% of your acknowledged sensory input is visual, much of the auditory information coming into your brain goes consciously unnoticed. Can deteriorating unused cells in the brain's hearing center contribute to a hearing loss? Some people have hearing that is so attuned that they can play a musical instrument totally \"by ear.\" Mozart could hear a piece once, and play it perfectly from memory alone. E ven though some people have neural connections more naturally adapted to a sense of perfect pitch than others, research has shown that training can make the ability of absolute pitch available to anyone, and regardless of their musical inclinations. It does seem though that reading the language of musical notes is a left brain function, which is why some 'idiot savants' with left brain impairment have learned to play instruments only 'by ear' (a right brain function). One young man learned the long distance sound tones of the telephone company so well, he could simulate them in a phone booth without depositing any money, but simply by whistling! Work with a partner and a touch button phone. As your partner touches each button, you discern the number being pressed. This tonal discernment can be picked up rather quickly. Next, using a rotary style phone, have your partner dial each digit. Get used to the sound of the clicks for each number so that eventually you can tell any phone number by just the sound of its being dialed.

Continue with this and vary the sound effects from items to include crinkling, crackling, hissing, sizzling, creaking, soft whizzing, whirring, flapping and tearing. In a country field, on a city street, or at a beach location, practice for 5 minutes with your eyes closed identifying distant and nearby sounds -- picking each one out, one at a time. Now embrace them together by switching your conscious awareness very rapidly back and forth from one to another until a unified mixing is achieved. Listen to a symphony recording and pick out each instrument being played. Then simply appreciate the entire blend. You can do this just like you can recognize your name spoken in a crowded room or you can embrace all the conversations at once. If this drill is done in a group, you'll find that other people will pick up things that you missed and vice versa. Many people can learn to discern one musician from another just by their individual playing style. Blindfold yourself and have an assistant drop a coin on the floor. What denomination is it? Now drop 2 coins. What denominations are they? Increase the number of coins and vary the combinations. Have your assistant drop certain pieces of silverware with the coins and discern the differences and their identities. Throw a paper wad into various sizes of empty bowls, pans and other containers and determine the size of the container by the resounding sound. Always have a mental set ready for absorbing your auditory information and you'll be surprised how easy it will become to increase your awareness. Learn to visualize sounds and replay them in your mind after you hear them, and your recall of them later will improve. Those older people suffering from memory loss can certainly benefit from these challenging discernment exercises.

In fact, it is quite advantageous in certain sports and martial arts to be able to use both your feet with equal facility. The Greeks encouraged and tried to promote ambidexterity because it was simply logical in sports and battle to be adept with both hands instead of one. By combining the Phoenician style of writing right to left with their own left to right system, the Greeks created a reading and writing system called boustrophedon , where the lines ran alternately right-to-left and left-to-right. With alternating sweeps of the eyes back and forth, reading was more swift and efficient. Michelangelo (1475-1564) was a multi-faceted genius like Leonardo da Vinci. He often painted with both hands. When one got tired, he switched to the other. British artist, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802-1873) could draw with both hands simultaneously -- a horse's head with one hand and a stag's head with the other. He taught drawing and etching to Queen Victoria who was a lefty that became ambidextrous. Fleming, Einstein and Tesla were all ambidextrous. Benjamin Franklin was also ambidextrous and signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution with his left hand. U.S. 20th president, James Garfield was a well educated backwoodsman born in a log cabin. Although he could write with either hand with equal ease, he could also write Greek with his left hand and Latin with his right hand simultaneously! Harry Kahne demonstrated his mental dexterity in 1922 by performing several mental operations simultaneously. While one hand was writing mirror language, the other hand intermingled upside down and backward letters. Rats given diverse and enriched environments have more connective dendritic spines to their neurons and overall heavier brains than rats exposed to dull, unchallenging environments. Left-handed and ambidextrous people have 11% larger corpus callosa (the bundle of nerve fibers joining the right and left sides of the brain) than right handed people. An autopsy of Einstein's brain revealed a larger profusion of superficial capillaries interlacing the cerebral cortex than the average brain, as well as an additional amount of glial cells. Obviously the more we use and exercise our brain, the more it physically grows. The following exercises are designed to task the little used areas of the brain to allow such growth. To be able to use both hands equally well, practice is the key. During the day, use your left hand more (if you're right-handed) by consciously switching when you're"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"   MULTI-TASKING  211 about ready to do something -- pouring a glass of milk, bouncing a ball, flipping and picking up coins, hammering a nail, cutting and buttering bread, stirring your coffee, swirling water in a glass, twisting off bottle caps, etc. Wherever you would use your one hand, use the other instead -- putting a key in the door, combing your hair, brushing your teeth, shaving, grasping objects, etc. When putting on your clothes, put your other hand or foot into the garment first. Thread your belt around your waist in the opposite direction. Put your watch on your other hand. Use your other hand in sports -- hitting a baseball or a tennis ball, throwing a football, shooting a basketball, etc. Practice stirring 2 cups of tea simultaneously, swirling 2 half filled glasses of water clockwise and counterclockwise, and bouncing two balls at the same time. Get used to the kinesthetic feeling of using the muscles of both your hands and arms together. Catch 2 balls thrown to you at the same time. Throw 2 paper wads at the same time into the same paper basket -- one underhand and the other overhand. Throw 2 darts simultaneously at a dart board with both hands. Write with both hands at the same time (review \"Exercise -- Writing Mirror Language\"). Draw a butterfly, a vase or a geometric figure using both hands simultaneously, but keep practicing these exercises. Many musical instruments are played ambidextrously, and many athletes are adept at using both of their hands. Since swimming is an ambidextrous activity, teaching dyslectic children to swim often helps them to read and write normally because it balances the brain hemispheres. Become ambidextrous and along with an added physiological brain growth, a more balanced integration of your 2 hemispheres will be achieved. Studies have shown that ambidextrous people are more emotionally independent, more determined, more adaptable to new situations and more apt to handle problems without giving up."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"212  MULTI-TASKING Exercise 125 -- Writing Mirror Language B orn an illegitimate child, Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) had a genius that spanned art, engineering and science. He was ambidextrous and liked to draw with his left hand and paint with his right. Most of his inventions were recorded in his notebooks in mirror script. Some people have thought that Leonardo da Vinci wrote mirror script to obscure his written thoughts, but using his left hand for writing was probably just more comfortable. This right brain faculty is in keeping with his artistic and creative abilities as well. It seems the right brain acknowledges and generates upside down, backwards and mirror forms of information. Writing and reading foreign vocabulary in upside down or mirror fashion aids retention, because it is thrown to the right brain first (see \"Exercise -- Foreign Vocabulary - Upside Down). Turn any newspaper upside down and practice reading the primary headlines and items in bold print. Remember, Leonardo obviously was able to read his mirror script as well as write it. You'll find that it is also easier to render a simple line drawing when the material to copy from is held upside down. In children, the disorder of the central nervous system called dyslexia often involves a natural inclination to read and write in a reverse order. Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison were both dyslectic. A University of Wisconsin political professor, Andrew Levine is able to TALK backwards as easily as he does forwards. With no advance notice, Levine translates each word within 1/10 of a second and can reverse the sound of words in any language spoken to him and llits niatniam eht redro fo eht ecnetnes. Some children between the ages of 8 and 10 also have this strange ability and can reverse the spoken language, but it seems to be lost later in life. One university study revealed that 82% of all 5-year olds could easily mirror print, but only 13% of all 7- year olds could do so; and by age 8, the inclination for mirror writing virtually disappeared altogether. Since dyslectic children are less lateralized (left-right separa- tion of hemispheric brain function) than normal children, they could probably be helped more if they were encouraged to write with both hands instead of with only one hand, thus more properly balancing the hemispheres. Swimming and other ambidextrous activities have been shown to help dyslectics for this reason. Read the following paragraph of mirror language as fast as you can 3 times.

In the 20's and 30's, Harry Kahne performed on vaudeville doing the same thing, but used both hands simultaneously while talking to the audience and doing 2 separate mathematical calculations all at the same time! When asked how he performed such feats, he replied that practice was the key. Reading and writing mirror language is primarily a right brain skill. When you learn to write mirror language, your ability to read mirror language also improves. To begin writing mirror script, take a piece of chalk in each hand and begin printing the A, B, C's on a blackboard with both hands simultaneously. At first, put your hands in the center of the board and only watch your right hand while letting your left hand synchronously write the same thing as your right does. You'll notice a natural inclination of the left hand to write mirror script of whatever the right hand writes. Practice the A, B, C's in plain block letters at first; then after mastering that, begin practicing in long hand script, lower case letters, then later upper case letters. Soon you will be able to write only with the left hand in mirror script without the aid of the right hand writing normally. When you're away from a blackboard, pantomime the procedure with both your hands in front of you in midair. To assist in the process, visualize yourself writing mirror language and see in your mind's eye how it feels.

If you time your bounces to 60 per minute, it should enhance the effect. Using a mini-trampoline, certain multi-functioning abilities can be achieved with a regular rhythm.

With applied kinesiology , manual muscle testing is used to evaluate body function and strength through the dynamics of the musculo-skeletal system. Through muscle testing, it has been found that many factors can be beneficial or detrimental to muscle strength and body function. In the laboratory, a kinesiometer or dynamometer can effectively and impartially test your muscle strength at any given moment, but manual muscle testing by an individual examiner can prove equally as effective (see \"Exercise -- The Effect of Symbols\"). Dr. George Goodheart (a Detroit chiropractor responsible for the current develop- ment of applied kinesiology) discovered that various points on the body are receptors and stimulators of the lymphatic system, and that these receptors are connected to different organs and muscles of the body. It was also found that your thymus gland is linked to your immune system and your ability to resist disease and infection. Since your thymus gland is directly tied into your body's strength and energy flow, chewing a thymus extract can temporarily strengthen you. You can measure the many things that affect your life energy force with a simple kinesiological muscle test. By using a hand grip dynamometer, you can test your strength after exposure to specific energy fields, foods, pictures, words, symbols or even the thoughts of others directed toward you. For most people, listening to rock or country music, looking at unpleasant or negative pictures, eating sugar or red meat, coming into contact with plastics, synthetic clothing or cigarettes, and even thinking negative thoughts weakens a person kinesiologically. Although the effects are mostly temporary, constant exposure in these areas can continually deplete your bodily energy. Elimination of such exposure allows your body to strengthen itself again. By using applied kinesiology, your body's reaction to subtle electromagnetic energies can be determined. For instance, you'll test weak if a radar gun is aimed at you. By holding the back end of a lightning rod against your chest, all muscles, including your heart muscle will be weakened. By turning the rod around so that the point is against your chest, your strength will return. When a lit, standard fluorescent bulb is held over your head, all your muscles will test weak. When a full spectrum \"Ott-Lite\" is held over your head, all your muscles will test strong (like they will in sunlight). With so many environmental influences inundating you every day, kinesi- ological testing allows you to ascertain exactly how beneficial or detrimental these"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"234  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION factors are to your strength and energy. High in the hill country of Nepal and Tibet, men carry up to 240 lb. loads from village to village and barely work up a sweat. Older women almost match the men in strength and stamina. Indians in the thin air of the Andes manage similar feats as bearers. In fact, the world is filled with non-weight lifter \"types\" that perform incredible feats of strength every day, so the first principle to keep in mind is that you ARE already very strong. There are numerous cases of people exhibiting extra- ordinary strength during house fires or during the excitement of certain emergency situations. Also, under hypnotic \"sleep,\" subjects have demonstrated \"supernormal\" examples of strength. Since your body has not changed in these instances, the only difference lies simply in your mental attitude and your connection to the flow of universal energy around you ( see energy measuring device in the book’s back pages ). As an exercise, begin a 7-day program of becoming physically stronger. First, eliminate the word CAN'T and negative phrases about your physical ability. Repeat each day the following affirmations 3 times: \"I know I can become physically stronger.\" \"I feel myself growing stronger.\" \"I AM stronger today than I was yesterday.\" Remember that thought and desire precede accomplishment. Even Olympic weight lifters 'psych' themselves up with positive imagery and reinforce- ment before attempting to accomplish their weight lifts. During the next 7 days begin visualizing yourself as a person with great strength, like Mr. or Ms. Universe. Relax and close your eyes for 10 minutes in your easy chair and imagine yourself performing great feats of strength. Project a desire and enthusiasm in your visualization process to achieve greater strength and you will become stronger. Get excited about it. Have faith in yourself and your ability to be stronger and you will suddenly realize that you ARE stronger already. As another exercise, stand facing a partner with your arm extended, palm upward and your wrist on your partner's opposing shoulder. Let your other arm hang by your side. Now ask your partner to bend your extended arm using both his (her) hands to do so. With such poor leverage, he (she) can bend your arm quite easily no matter how hard you try to resist it. Now do it again, but this time consciously relax your arm and extend your fingers as you rest your wrist on his (her) shoulder. Close your eyes and visualize a golden stream of energy flowing through your arm and shooting through your fingers. Now ask your partner to bend your arm again. This time you will find it takes very little effort to resist him (her). Sometimes imagining your arm as a steel beam will accomplish the same thing. This is the power of your mind through visualization in increasing your strength."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  235 Exercise 143 -- Developing Productivity Under Pressure If you approach your day with anxiety or relaxation, which will drain your energy more? Which state will provide you with more productivity under pressure? This is not a comparison between the tortoise and the hare, because you can certainly proceed speedily throughout your day in a more relaxed way. Physical tasks requiring strength can also be accomplished by attacking each task with anxiety or they can proceed more smoothly with relaxation. The choice is always yours, but you’ll find that approaching your day and the tasks within it will always be less de- energizing if they are approached with mindful relaxation rather than mindless anxiety. Most people claim that they are under one kind of pressure or another all the time. By utilizing your time effectively though, you can become more productive and thereby lessen whatever pressure you're under. Eliminate statements like, \"I don't have the time,\" because what you really mean is, \"I don't want to bother making the time.\" The busiest people in the world are always able to find time for what they want to do, and not because they have any more time than others, but because they think in terms of \"making\" the time. If there is pressure and stress in your life, vary your routine during the day. Do things differently and problem-solving ideas will often be more easily generated. It is just as easy to cultivate positive habit patterns as it is to cultivate negative ones. Monotony is a bad habit. Acknowledge openly to yourself and congratulate yourself when you have changed a negative habit to a positive one. Pass over non-productive power stoppers as anger, irritation, revenge and hatred. Turn them into tranquility, tolerance, forgiveness and love. Your productivity will be assured and your pressure will be relieved. If you feel stressful emotion welling up inside of you, say to yourself in a commanding way, \"Stop, Calm, Calm, Relax,\" and allow the feeling to pass away. Remember YOU choose your thought patterns. If you give unpleasant thoughts time to build up, they are harder to control, so recognize and eliminate them early. Write down the situation causing you pressure, and list all the stressful points. Many times looking at the written form sheds new light on the subject, and a positive aspect can be found. After finding the positive aspect, focus energy into it and magnify it. This has a curious effect of minimizing the negative. Thought precedes action, so direct your thinking toward action, rather than fear and worry. For instance, what can be done about the situation? Don't be afraid of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"236  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION making mistakes. Those who don't make mistakes don't try anything. The secret to productively accomplishing something is not in the \"seeking to,\" but in the \"expecting to\" frame of mind. Act as though you have already received or achieved what you have set out to do. It will work wonders for you! Laugh at your stressful situation. Look at the people and things causing you pressure as childishly diminutive in comparison to the universe. Humor is a way of looking at things in another perspective and often has a relieving tendency. When you’re under pressure, create some fun for yourself. Make believe you are a particular guru you have read about. Make decisions and take actions the way you think the guru would for a day. Lighten up on yourself, and don’t take yourself so seriously. Sit down and doodle or work some puzzles out for a while to change your routine. Go play handball or tennis or go swimming at least once a week or when you feel particularly stressed. Surround yourself with things that make you smile when you look at them or visualize for a few moments some things during the last year that made you smile. Design a tape of positive affirmations for yourself to be played in your car while going to work or while at home washing dishes. Select statements like, \"You are becoming more productive every day in every way.\" \"You are coping with daily situations more adequately.\" \"Your thoughts are clearer and your alertness is keener.\" By listening to these and other statements during the day, your subconscious will begin to react positively to them. There is a magic in words, and your subconscious has a strong tendency to obey suggestions, so make sure they're positive ones. In some situations, you can simply sit for 5 minutes in a relaxed comfortable position and observe yourself slowly taking several deep breaths in and out. Drop your shoulders and let them hang limp. After the 5 minutes are up, you will feel calmer and more in control. Your thoughts will be more ordered and less confused. As soon as we start doing, we learn how to proceed. ........

All sorts of things occur to help one that would otherwise not have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, do it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now.\"    ....... Goethe Our outer world of circumstances shapes itself from our inner world of thought. YOU hold the key to your own happiness by exercising your power to choose your own thoughts. A thought is the crystalline predecessor to action. People often change their environment, but are reluctant to change themselves. To change your 'luck,' change your attitude. Commit yourself to the accomplishment of your dream. How can you achieve happiness or peace of mind when your thoughts are contrary to it? People preoccupied with fears and worries draw to themselves that which they fear and worry about the most, sometimes called 'bad luck.' Inadver- tently, they have committed themselves to seeing the world with fear and worry, hence they receive what their minds dwell upon. Even random thoughts and those in the back of the mind must be consciously controlled so you can focus on what you truly want out of life. There is little mystery here. The greater the clarity, energy and focus you project (your committment) onto what you want, the faster and easier it is unveiled for you. Resonance is demonstrated when we play the E note on a piano and all the other E strings start to vibrate as well, responding in resonance with the first one played. The thought images and emotions you project forth from yourself vibrate as well, and people who are resonating similar thoughts and emotions will be attracted to you and you to them in what often appears to be pure accident. Learn to see things the way you want them to be with love, courage, enthusiasm and excitement. Learn to treat people the way you would like to be treated, and you not only improve their mental atmosphere, but your own as well! As a precursor to this exercise, do \"Exercise -- Concentration To Relieve Stress\" first. Now think about what would bring about a happy state in your life and hold"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"238  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION that image. Place yourself there and experience what it is like. For example, a man visualized owning an expensive sports car, but to his surprise, found that it did not feel good to him when he placed himself in the mental scene of possessing it. Mental imagery allows you to try on different roles to see how they feel to you. After determining what images would bring about happiness in your life, begin to crystallize and replay those images in your daily life. Learn that you are in control of your thoughts and use your thought power to change them to happy thoughts. Create images involving smell, taste, touch and hearing in your visual scenes for better detail, but keep the visualizations directed toward activation. Be the person you imagine yourself can be, and you will no longer have to put yourself down and be the person you don't want to be. Do you blame the circumstances around you or other people for the things that happen to you? Do you wait for someone or something to come along to change matters in your life? Catch yourself from saying, \"I never have any luck,\" or \"I KNEW that would happen to me\" when something 'bad' happens. Begin to realize that you bring about your own luck -- whether it be good or bad -- by the thoughts you hold in your mind. By changing your concept of your limitations, you realize that luck is not random, but is manipulated by your own consciousness to produce the so-called coincidences in your everyday life. Care in selecting your thought patterns during just one day can make big changes in your life. What you radiate in thought is what you attract in reality. There are no coincidental meetings with others that take place. All relationships in whatever form or manner are purposeful experiences for you and they are called into your personal sphere for specific growth- oriented reasons. You create your own reality. So know that everything is as it needs to be, no matter how it appears at the moment. When people achieve that which they have visualized, they often attribute it just to 'luck,' and never see themselves responsible for its creation! To prove to yourself that your visualization is working, list at the end of the day any 'chance' events or happenings that 'luckily' went your way or led in the direction of what you visualized. These are indications that you are activating the right mental processes. Keep a record of your results and your progress each day, and reread to yourself periodically how things are working out for you. This listing process also has a tendency to reinforce your faith in yourself and keeps you focused."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  239 Exercise 145 -- Imagine and Mind Walk Your Goals \"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he\" (Prov. 23:7) is an excerpt from the Bible that applies to one of God's universal laws. Is simply controlling and directing your own thoughts towards what you want out of life all there is to the process of getting it? Why then do people so often obtain that which they don't want in life, instead of that which they DO want? Could it be that they really don't know what they truly DO want, and when they do know what they want, their thoughts are not focused on it with enough clarity and duration to get it? Do you inadvertently visualize in a worried fashion that which you DON'T want with more clarity and frequency than that which you do want? The following positive imagery and mind walking exercise WILL work as long as it is maintained with more concentrated duration than your negative imagery -- and remember, keep your visualizations to yourself and free from other people's critical remarks (which can only undermine your belief in the imagery process). Things of positive consequence in your life will happen when you consciously accept that they can happen. Then your commitment and clarity of intention will draw to you what you seek. We all create our own heaven or hell by the thoughts we carry inside of us. Controlling your own thoughts takes practice, but the rewards are indeed quite great! Now take a minute and clarify in your mind what you would like to experience in your life. Write it all down and put it in black and white. When you read it later, it will look clearer and more plausible to you. Goals give you purpose and direction. Without goals, life has little purpose for most people. To put a plan into action, you must have a vivid and clear description of it, so describe your short-term and long- term goals. King Solomon did not ask the Lord for riches, honor or long life. He simply said, \"Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart ...\" (1 Kings 3:9). In seeking and receiving wisdom, the other things were also added unto him. Choose a goal that by its nature will carry other favorable things with it in its natural fulfillment, and be sure that you're willing to accept the responsibility of all that it entails. To affirm a definite purpose and decisively set forth a committed desire for a goal direction is empowering, because you become buoyed up in the flow of its action. Also an accepting and a “letting go” process helps to keep you in the flow of receiving what you want. Resisting and objecting to the process works against the flow of receiving what you want. Getting what you want may not always take the path you might expect, so flow and accept whatever comes your way.

Allow yourself to slip into a twilight state of mind just before the sleep level (review \"Exercise -- Learning Self-Hypnosis\"). Now use your imagination and create an image of what it would feel like if your dream or goal were fulfilled. Visualize it for 7 seconds. Don't just imagine a passive scene, but fully associate yourself with the goal experience of an active, vigorous scene. Add to the goal as many details as you need, and visualize it again for 7 seconds. Add to your vision all the sensory data and feelings of accomplishment you intend to achieve upon your goal's realization. See where you want to be. Hear the sounds of the people involved. Feel textures and smell fragrances in your visualization. Emotionalize with it, and visualize it in this way for 7 seconds. Mind walk the whole imagery through to completion. Think prosperity, achievement and success, and create a sincere longing for the fulfillment of your goal. Now sleep for a few minutes to seal the experience into your subconscious. Your expectant attitude and internal feelings of acceptance will take it from there. Periodically throughout your day, replay to yourself this goal visualization, and guide your actions toward its completion. Accept your imagery as if it has already taken place and watch how it completes that thought process to reality! Strong emotional imaging can activate your subconscious into realizing your goal, but conscious com- mitted action gets the job done. Success is the ongoing process of striving to improve your situation in every way. By taking committed action toward your goal, you are no longer sitting on the fence of indecision. Clear action is how success can truly be yours. So get to it, and let your impetus carry you forward. Figure out the details while you’re in motion. The clearer and longer that you practice this exercise, the better and faster the effect. Naturally, a master will achieve swifter results than a neophyte. When you know and once realize your true inner power, all is within your grasp. (“If ye have faith and doubt not, ... if ye shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be cast into the sea, it shall be done.” Matt. 21:21) Actually, directed goal realization differs very little from what happens more haphazardly in your life already. The emotional images derived from fear, worry, anxiety and loneliness bring about their corresponding realities into your life the same as love, forgiveness, mercy and happiness. Conscious clarity of directed thought can change your life! If you want to improve your body posture or physical appearance, examine that area and touch it with your fingertips. Now shift your conscious awareness to the area and visualize it in its ideal state. Maintain the visualization for several minutes."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  241 Repeat positive affirmations as you do this. Upon retiring at night, drift off to sleep holding a positive image of whatever goal you want to accomplish.

And remember, whatever you visualize for yourself, affirm it for others in a loving way, and it will help you both. (\"...But faith which worketh by love.\" Galatians 5:6) So create an impelling desire for what you want and visualize constantly to achieve it. Then relax, and trust the process to manifest it. Here are some key points to keep in mind: 1. When you set goals for yourself, commit yourself to their achievement. 2. Don't make excuses for yourself. If you fail, try another tack, angle, plan, or direction. 3. Have a definite plan or strategy for reaching your goal(s). 4. Be willing to do what it takes to get what you want. 5. Stay \"in action\" and don't allow yourself to get sidetracked or to slow down just because things become challenging. 6. Don't blame others for anything. It serves no purpose, it takes you out of focus of your goals, and it is a big \"energy drainer.\" You are responsible for your life and everything that happens in it. 7. If you falter at one stage of your goal, replan it, and start a new approach.. Don’t delay for long or you will lose your momentum. 8. Be clear in your vision and keep your focus. 9. Ask for help from everyone you trust, respect and admire in helping you reach your goals. You'll be surprised at how willing many people are to help you. 10.

To get what you want out of life, there is an age old formula which entails first, say aloud to yourself & write down what you want with clarity and focus; second, believe that you can get what you want and dwell on that belief; and third, proceed and commit yourself to a plan of action in your goal direction to eliminate the possibility of future doubts. Your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference between what you want and what you don't want. It only knows what you focus upon, and that's what it creates. To maintain a clear focus for something, you can also use positive affirmations & imagery to help the process. To further activate the flow of abundance in your direction, a \"giving\" process should be initiated. This \"putting forth\" necessitates a \"receiving back\" as in cause and effect. It also helps to stave off any selfish fixations for receiving money and material things, so keep the giving process going. Remember though, it is always possible for you to get anything you want by following these basic rules, but don't obtain the things of the world at the expense of your own personal growth and development. The more things you accumulate, the more difficult it is to separate yourself from them. They hold you like anchors. Instead, allow money and material things to flow through you without attachment. The higher aspirations of life are not part of the material and sensory world. Not one of your worldly possessions will pass with you to the other side. \"...

Write it down on paper. Form a clear visualization about it. See yourself having it. What does it feel like? Visualize how it looks and determine when you want it in realistic terms. Write down a positive affirmation about achieving it. For example, \"Abundant wealth is flowing to me as I actively move in the direction of my goal.\" Repeat the affirmation over and over during the day while visualizing to yourself the accomplishment of your goal. Next, truly believe and accept it is possible to achieve your goal and feel yourself enjoying it. Then, give money or service to some needy cause or person every day throughout the exercise week. Whatever you want in life, you must learn how to give it first. You can never really lose something of true inner value when you give it. Even forgiving people of debts that are owed to you is a form of giving,"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  243 but you must genuinely do so. Next, proceed with a plan of action toward your goal, and every day achieve some step in that direction. Action eliminates doubt or otherwise you wouldn't be taking action! The sooner you start moving, the sooner you'll get results. Don't worry about anything while you're in motion either. There are no big deals in the world, just small deals that have been made to look big by the thoughts we carry. Just proceed ahead and figure out any missing details in your plan while you’re in motion. You'll soon find that people will start following you when you begin moving in some direction, because they figure you know what you're doing and where you're going. Opportunities will begin popping up everywhere. So be alert and learn how to take advantage of them when they occur. Don't turn away gifts and help when offered to you. Anytime you're in doubt, ask yourself, \"Am I seeing all the opportunities available to me today, or am I stuck in some way and blocking myself from seeing them.\" Some people receive monetary or material benefits without even realizing it. Their state of mind keeps them from recognizing it! Your world is in a state of plasticity where so many integrating factors often make it hard to recognize the different variables that make your world up. Also, proceed throughout each day as if your receiving of the desired goal is expected and already assured. This assumed faith in obtaining your goal allows you to trust yourself and speed up the process. It also keeps you in a positive frame of mind. If you learn to expect what you want, hoping does not become part of it. Many obstacles miraculously are removed from your path and favorable synchronistic \"coincidences\" suddenly happen to you all along the way. The formula is simple enough, and it has worked for countless people all over the world. Just put forth and commit yourself to achieving your true desires; let go and trust the process; then receive and enjoy the results. The biggest difference in how people achieve material things in this world is not the product or service they are marketing, but the attitude they have when they're marketing it. You can sell rocks as \"pets\" and make a million dollars in 90 days like the originator of “Pet Rocks” did, or you can belittle the idea and make nothing on it at all. A committed action-oriented attitude of anticipation and expectation more quickly draws to you what you want. Even if you spend money frivolously, you can still receive a return on it, as long as you anticipate and expect a return on it as you spend it. Lastly, there is a big difference between wanting to do something and having to do something. When stressed to the point of having to move in a certain direction (or"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"244  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION tricking your mind to think in this way), your energy to accomplish is magnified and synchronistic events happen to you with more speed, because you have added commitment to the process.

Now there are many variables as to how a person processes available energy, but however the person is processing his available energy, you have increased the available energy to him or her with your kindly prayers. The longer and clearer your prayer for that person, the more energy is provided. Good health and high energy go hand in hand. People with high energy are healthier than people with low energy, so increasing one’s energy level increases one’s health (see “Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health”). As an exercise in sending energy to someone, work with a partner situated in another room or in the same room with you but with his back toward you. Both of you sit in a relaxed, comfortable position (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"), and do some deep, abdominal breathing. Both of you close your eyes and maintain a receptive or at least neutral, non-skeptical state of mind for the exercise. Now visualize your partner's body and choose one area to send healing energies into. Focus & emotionally feel the pulsating energy permeating & soothing only that selected area, perhaps like a funnel of energy. Visualize your hands stroking and healing that area. When your partner feels a sensation of warmth, or a tickling or anything else, ask him to indicate what area it is in. If it's not the area you're visualizing, say nothing and keep sending energy to him until he gets the correct area, or you both get tired. P ushing too hard loses the rapport. A relaxed concentration is best. Receptivity to your energy is also important. If the person is closed or blocked, receiving your energy will be difficult. As an exercise variation to the above, let several people send energy to the same predesignated bodily area of a subject (see \"Exercise -- Group Telepathy\"), and follow the same procedure. You might also use a psychotronic diagram (see \"Exercise -- Psionic or Psychotronic Generators\") or a crystal (see \"Exercise -- Using Quartz Crystals\") to amplify your results. As an exercise to create a favorable effect on a person from a distance, sympa- thetically achieve a connected state or feeling to that person and see them in a healthy state, not in their ill state. Bathe them with thoughts, prayer or feelings of love, joy, compassion, happiness and confidence. Imagine a white bubble or funnel of such feelings and envelop them with it.

O nce you achieve sufficient amplitude and focus to your thought projections, helping someone at a distance will become easier, but be sure the person is open and expectantly receptive to the idea of your help, and not disbelieving or skeptically blocked to the process. Depending upon many factors (the way they breathe, the emotions they express, the way they think about themselves, etc.), each person processes available energy differently. By feeling compassionate love or great empathy, you can relinquish your personal ego and become part of something that is more than just yourself, and then you can truly help many people."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  247 Exercise 148 -- Pain Away Breathing T his exercise for the relief of minor pain is based on following the beats of your heart, so sit or lie down in a relaxed position. Feel your pulse and begin by counting the beats aloud, until you get a sense of the rhythm. Inhale through your nose to the count of 6, hold it to the count of 3, exhale to the count of 6, pause for 3 counts; then repeat the process. While inhaling, visualize energy being sent to the painful area to repair damaged cells and reestablish proper circulation. When exhaling, imagine the pain exiting the body. Repeat this cycle 7 times; then rest. Repeat the process two more times in sets of 7. To provide variety to the exercise, breathe in the color orange during the procedure above (or whatever other color your inner self deems more suitable). This breathing technique not only eliminates pain, but also many negative emotional feelings as well. Also, since laughter releases pain-relieving endorphins into your system, artificially laugh occasionally to assist the process of pain relief."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"248  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Exercise 149 -- Headache Relief To begin with, stop affirming your so-called headache is a headache. Call it a so- called headache. This initiates doubt for the subconscious that the pain is even really there. Next, query yourself about it. How big is it? The size of a marble, golf ball or soft ball? Does it throb? Is the pain sharp or dull? Point to where in your head you feel it, and bring your conscious awareness to the area. Is it surface oriented or subsurface oriented? Is it long or short? Picture in your mind its appearance. Does it have a color? Is it hollow or solid? Let your answers be what first comes to your mind. Where is the so-called headache now? Continue visualizing and describing the so-called headache until it vanishes. Preoccupation with these mental questions and answers takes the mind off the tension which brought about your head pain. Whether it is vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the cranial blood vessels, just shifting your conscious awareness to the pain area brings about a more normalized blood flow, and touching the spot helps to orient your conscious awareness as to its location."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  249 Exercise 150 -- Using Self-Healing Thoughts All doctors acknowledge the power of your mind to heal your body. They use terms to explain away such healings like the “placebo effect” or a “state of remission,” but they know it’s your mind that is creating such an effect on your body. Your body has a natural ability to protect and heal itself on a day to day basis. All so-called “cures” that take place in the world are simply stimulations of your own immune system. When your energy is high, so is your health. When your energy is low, so is your ability to heal itself, and it’s at this time that you’re most susceptible to ill health. Most people have heard of Christian Science practitioners refusing surgical operations on serious ailments -- even cancer -- because of their belief structure of mind over matter. How is the process of self-healing done? How can you reduce or eliminate your susceptibility to ailments with the power of your mind? F irst of all, you should realize that every particle and atom in the universe is connected in some way to every other particle, and all the particles of your body are closely associated with each other. Your body is especially responsive to the programming of the mind. There is no thought or emotion you can experience that does not affect the body in some way. That is why care must be taken to see yourself in the best possible way. With the power of a visualization, you can rearrange the atoms in your body to produce a healthy condition or an ill condition. It depends on how you see and program yourself. When you see yourself in a better light, and program yourself with positive self-talk, you automatically transfer the benefits to your body and mind. When you begin feeling better, give yourself credit. Congratulate yourself and thank the Lord for your better feelings. Gratitude is a large part of continuing to feel better about yourself. You create your own reality. After all, if you think things happen by chance, how can you be responsible for what happens to you? If you have a low self-image and don’t like yourself, how can your body produce a perfectly healthy structure? How can you fulfill in your body what you’re not thinking in your mind? Many people take the stance: \"I’m not going to be sick today, I don't have time for it\", and go through life without any maladies? Conscious choice and will power do make a difference, so tune into yourself and make good choices. You can consciously manipulate your cellular structure through the power of your thoughts. You can visualize the ailment diminishing and diminishing until finally the excretory system carries it away. By imagining the process, you complete the connection between your mind and your body. Of course, the prayers of others can"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"250  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION also help to resonate the process to make the metamorphosis more complete. In the East, yogis and lamas perform similar visualizations to achieve the same result. They may even add to the process by vibrating their inner tissues with a chant, like the sound, 'Aum-m-m.' Any number of visualizations can be created to combat and conquer internal disorders and disease. Imagining a swarm of healthy and powerful white blood cells (sharks) doing battle and eliminating the unhealthy disease cell (weak little fish) has worked for many people. Visualizing a funnel of white energy swirling over a troublesome spot has worked as well. Verbalizing and affirming to yourself what you want healed, and then allowing the body to complete the task with an open receptivity to the process is also good. When you have an ache or a pain, it’s the body’s signal to you that an area of the body needs addressing. As an exercise, bring your conscious awareness to the painful location and dwell on the area for a while. The connected mind of those cells has to respond to your healing, soothing, energizing thoughts. As you learned in “Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness,” your blood volume increases markedly in an area of the body you are consciously thinking about, and with the blood also comes helpful body chemicals and ailment-fighting antibodies and leuco- cytes. Stay mindful and focused on the painful area and feel it respond. Talk to the area and discuss what you want to take place there. This process often relieves emotional blocks that are tied to the cells there. It's good preventive practice to give yourself a nightly visualization/affirmation for all your bodily parts to heal and repair themselves. Do this while consciously bringing your awareness to each area of the body in a methodical, relaxed way, and holding it there for several seconds. Unfulfilled needs create chaos and imbalance. Our bodies suffer. It often only takes a few minutes to make time for what we need to do in our lives. Yet it's easy to become out of touch with our bodies and our health. Most people want a pill or injection to “fix” them because they’ve been told that that is the way to treat most disorders. If they were told that they had to think differ- ently or have a more positive attitude towards themselves, they might not understand the process. Whatever your behavioral patterns are, if you do the same thing throughout your life, you’ll get the same result. When you change what you are doing, saying and thinking about yourself, you change the result you get afterwards."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  251 Exercise 151 -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health Do you usually associate a healthy person with low energy? Of course not! People with high energy are usually very healthy, and those with low energy are susceptible to low health. With this in mind, it would stand to reason that you would naturally want to increase your energy in every possible way to optimize your chances of excellent health, right? You know when you feel weak and sickly or when you feel strong and healthy, but how can you measure your own energy level ( see the measuring device described in the back of the book )? Do you even know what specifically causes the highs and lows in your energy amplitude? People sleep to renew their energy. The more relaxed their rest and sleep, the more easily their energy is increased. What other factors are involved with your energy level? Nutrition, emotions, posture, water quality, breathing, exercise, music, aromas or simply seeing a movie can all have a bearing on your energy level. One of the most important factors related to your energy level though is your sense of purpose. One reason why many elderly folks lose their vitality for living is because of retirement! Work provides people with a sense of purpose, and when their work is removed, their energy level can drop dramatically. So find some purpose for your life - charity work, a new vocation or avocation, a goal, a hobby or a pursuit you always wanted to take up, or better yet, tune into your spiritual reason for being here. When your life has purpose, you will not only feel better about yourself, but your energy level will rise as well. Understand that all factors are interrelated too, so if you improve one, the others must also improve. For instance, if you are nutrition oriented, beginning a diet of raw organic vegetables will increase your energy level, and in turn you’ll also begin noticing improvement in your breathing, your posture, your emotions and the music you prefer. If you are exercise oriented, beginning a daily routine of good exercise and deep belly breathing will increase your energy level too, and in turn your nutrition, your emotions and your posture will tend to improve as well! Exercise also works well with children having a low self-esteem. Statistics have shown that creating basketball courts or gymnasiums in poverty stricken neighborhoods lowers crime and drug addiction in those neighborhoods. To raise your spirits, raise your energy level. If you feel down in any way, exercise for 30 minutes or do deep connected breathing for several minutes or watch an action packed movie or do something else to raise your energy level. Improving"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"252  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION the mental and emotional attitude that you carry with you every day can allow your energy to flow in better harmony. Some people block the flow of the available energy around them with negative thought patterns they create and project from themselves, like worry, doubt, anger, fear, hatred, depression, etc. When you are frequently objecting, saying “no” or saying “I can’t,” you block the energy flow, and place boundaries, restrictions and limitations around yourself. You can eat the best of organic foods and take all the best supplements with the best water and still have a low energy level by feeling lousy about yourself and those around you! Once you change your emotional attitude and start thinking better about yourself, then good nutrition, better posture, better breathing, good exercise, good music and a good environment can benefit in raising your energy level too! At least, open yourself to the possibility of having higher energy and that alone will help to relieve some of your blocks to it! Although the initial effects are mostly temporary, continual exposure to weakening factors can eventually lead to a more lasting condition of ill health. Elimination of debilitating factors in your life allows your body to build up its energy reserves again, just like during the process of sleep and relaxation. By increasing your energy, your health correspondingly improves. We are constantly engulfed in a sea of energy, whether it’s from the earth, the sun or the life forms around us. When we accept the things that happen to us and know we have created our own circumstances, we flow with the process in that understanding. When we flow in harmony with the natural energies around us, we tune into and feel the oneness of everything. We synchronize our energy level with such harmony. We can always express our preferences, but our choices in life produce the results we get. Our lives always reflect the choices we make. Acceptance allows flowingness. Objection blocks the process. Just as a booing, critical audience can deflate the energy level of a speaker, athletes know that cheering from a crowd can increase their energy level for a better performance. The excitement of a crowd is very contagious. By suffusing your essence with excitement, enthusiasm and positive words, thoughts and actions, you can increase your own energy level, even if you do so artificially! Weight lifters know this so they pump themselves up with positive thoughts and words before they lift a heavy weight. During angry or fearful excitement, some people have lifted cars or other heavy objects quickly and without thought. During pleasurable or sexual excitement, fatigue and pain are often ignored without any thought. Since high excitement goes"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  253 hand in hand with high energy, creating an excited state of mind will increase your energy. You can artificially increase your energy level by artificially creating an excited state in yourself. Try jumping up and down and saying aloud, “I’m excited, I’m excited” several times and notice your energy level go up! You can get energized by practicing energetic activities, rhythm and dancing for instance, or even thinking of such activities in a visualized way will raise your energy level. The benefit of high excitement brings about higher energy, which in turn brings about higher health. High energy people are highly motivated, more positive people, and rarely have time for depression, worry, hatred or other negative emotions. Their mental acuity also increases. So create excitement in your life, and your mental and emotional health will both improve. Watch movies and videos that create a high energy state. Imagine yourself excited, enthusiastic, energetic about something and soon you will find your body responds to the imaging. If you continually say how sick you are or how many aches and pains you have, how can you expect to feel strong? You’re reliving your aches and pains every time you talk about them. By having faith in yourself and your ability to be stronger, you can increase your energy amplitude and begin to realize that you ARE already very strong! By using their indomitable spirit, dying people have even postponed their own deaths until after special events or projects were completed or finished! As an individual, you have the potential of being a virtual powerhouse of energy. Since all living systems are similar in their basic energy structure, all living things affect each other by the subtle interchange of their intercellular communication. This is the basis of the unified field concept. Even without a conscious direction, a person with a powerful energy field can have it homeostatically transfer itself to a weaker energy field. (“And a woman having an issue of blood came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood dried up. And Jesus said, Who Touched me?...Somebody has touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.” Luke 8:43 - 46) The low, ailing energy around the woman was openly receptive to Jesus’s high energy and she was automatically healed by it as it flowed into her. Positive expressions of love, compassion, help, courage, enthusiasm, kindness and encouragement assist in a favorable interchange between living systems, while anger, fear, worry, hatred, lust, condemnation, laziness and greed hinder the process. E very word, action and thought that you have affects your energy level in some way. By tuning into yourself, you can learn how to discern what energizes you from what de-energizes you. For example, if you saw or visualized a little puppy playing,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"254  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION you probably would experience warmth and a good feeling inside, and your energy level would be heightened. On the other hand, if that same little puppy was suddenly struck by a car while you watched or as you visualized it, you would feel a negative reaction to it in your solar plexus quite distinctly. As a daily exercise, practice observing and tuning into your positive and negative reactions to the things around you. For instance, when you eat something, tune into whether the food energizes or de-energizes you. By mindfully being with your emotional reactions as they are happening, you can learn what builds and what tears down your energy level. In this way, you can achieve better clarity for yourself. To bring balance and harmony in your life, associate yourself with factors that will benefit and help you. Do things with a total involved feeling of enjoyment rather than a mechanistic or disheartened feeling. Every time you harmonize your energy system with wholesome food, natural fiber clothing, a positive attitude, controlled deep breathing and relaxation, the easier it is to draw from the universal energy well. The more you increase your energy amplitude, the better able you are to withstand the detrimental factors of pathogenic cellular invaders, pollution and accidental injury. After maximizing your internal energy amplitude, synchronizing your energy with the energy of the universe brings about an inner feeling of oneness and peace. You can proceed through your day in a relaxed, powerful way! A man changes the world every time he changes himself. (\"Jesus said unto him, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.\" Mark 9:23) As an exercise in increasing your awareness and acuity in discerning your own energy level, practice determining your own energy level on a scale of 1 to 5 throughout each day. You can use the following as a guide: Energy Level 1 - Very tired, ready for a nap or sleep. Energy Level 2 - A little less tired, but sluggishly dragging through your day. Energy Level 3 - Moving through your day at an average level, not especially great,  but not sluggish. Energy Level 4 - Movement oriented, like after your first cup of coffee. You feel like  doing. You feel like action. Energy Level 5 - You feel super great, like you want to jump off the wall or do back  flips."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  255 Exercise 152 -- Shifting Your Conscious Awareness By shifting your conscious awareness to one of your arms and holding it there, you can increase the blood volume and pulse in that arm (review \"Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness\"). By shifting your conscious awareness to the tasting areas of your mouth and tongue, you can increase the saliva flow. By shifting your conscious awareness to a headache area, and questioning yourself about it (the opposite is what you normally do), you dilate the blood vessels in that area and relieve the vascular constriction causing the so-called headache (review \"Exercise -- Headache Relief\"). Conversely, if you have a minor cut and shift your conscious awareness away from the wound, you help to constrict the blood flow. One Israeli researcher, Ilan Shalif, Ph.D., has found that holding your focus on an ailing part of the body for several minutes each day will bring the body’s defenses to the area to repair it! These are all physiological effects brought about by shifting your conscious awareness. Now how about psychological effects? The next time you are fearful, sad, lonely, horny, angry, depressed or even hungry, shift your conscious awareness into the gut urge or negative emotion. When you do this, attempt to understand your feeling with the logical, conscious side of the brain. By holding your conscious attention to it (questioning, examining, etc.), a shift is often accomplished and your conscious input allows the gut urge or negative emotion to dissipate. When you get very good at this, your conscious side of the brain will no longer be overridden by your subconscious urges. You will have volitional control over experiencing or not experiencing any feeling you choose. Your conscious mind will do the choosing, because IT will be in control. It is interesting to note that when you experience love (not lust), friendliness or joy, shifting your conscious awareness into the emotion only intensifies the experience and the positive feeling does NOT dissipate. Since most people run primarily on a subconscious awareness during the day, they are constantly susceptible to the suggestive influences of others. Consequently, high pressure salesmen, loud preachers, politicians and emotional or sensory oriented advertisements on TV (with a 10 - 20% increase in sound volume) all have a convincing effect on the subconscious person. To demonstrate how you can shift someone's conscious awareness for him (as magicians do in the art of distraction), do the following pattern interrupt experiment. If someone is inundating you with negative communication, you can interrupt the other person's behavioral pattern by: 1) interrupting his (her) story with a more positive remark or even an unrelated"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"256  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION comment. 2) offering a handshake, then quickly withdrawing your hand. 3) staring up suddenly at something in the air. 4) halting abruptly if walking in rhythm with someone. If your action is chosen carefully enough not to break the rapport, the pattern interrupt tends to achieve momentary confusion and/or temporary amnesia in the other person. At this point, the person also becomes susceptible to suggestion. Implanting positive suggestions at this point can achieve the other person's compliance because he (she) wants to trade confusion for clarity and will go along with your clarity for a short time at least. You can implant a suggestion into the mind of a subconsciously oriented person, if you choose the right moment. For instance, ask someone a question, and as he is listening to where your question is going and trying to formulate a response, there is a transitional lapse of time in his cognitive thinking process. During this instant of being blank, lightly slap him on the shoulder or shout at him (an unexpected event that shifts his conscious awareness) and implant the suggestion that he forgot his answer. Then after he stutters and stammers for several seconds, snap your fingers and suggest that now he remembers, and he will. As an exercise, flash your conscious awareness into and out of physiological areas for more conscious control over those areas. (Sometimes touching the area with your fingers helps to locate the area for you.) Use the power of visualization in conjunction with this process. For instance, do you have an upset stomach? Flash your conscious awareness right into the upset condition and become aware of the churning mixture of junk in the stomach. To relieve it, either throw it up from your mouth or visualize the lower stomach valve opening up and letting the stuff vent the stomach. (The sick feeling is brought about by its retention in the stomach.) By being consciously aware of this process and visualizing it, the body will respond. During the day, when a negative emotion pops up, shift your conscious awareness into it for more control and hold it there. Examine the emotion. Do you want it? Is it good for you? What physiologically is happening to you because of it? Keep consciously examining and questioning yourself about it and you trick the emotional side of the mind into releasing its control. It has to yield to the logical side of the mind if you WILL your conscious awareness into the experience (review \"Exercise -- Consciously Disciplining Yourself\").

Your fantasizing can be turned into a productive form. In the morning, before proceeding toward your daily activities for the day, conjure up an image of the way you want things to happen. Thoughts have the power to become tangible things. Some desired things require less imaging than others to manifest because certain visualizations have no competing thoughts or influences from other people desiring the same thing. Even your own thoughts can compete in bringing about a desired result. How many times during the day do you catch yourself thinking or visualizing negativity about yourself or another person or situation? The total tonnage and quantity of such negative imaging is often so disproportionate to your positive imaging that you usually don't have to look any further than your own internal visualizations to discover why things don't work out for you. Create a visualization of how successfully you want things to go at work, during lunchtime, during business encounters, driving back from work, etc. You can even do this at high speed in your mind, (review \"Exercise -- Time Distortion\"). For instance, set a timer for 1 or 2 minutes and visualize yourself participating and completing all your daily activities before your timer runs out. You can also do your visualizations at different times during the day and even change your scenes according to circumstances. Discipline yourself and devote at least 15 minutes or more each day to visualizing some desired result for yourself. This is such a simple thing, but it can help you immensely, because thought precedes action. The clearer and more focused your thoughts are, the better able you are to keep a committed direction to your life. If your daily activities seem haphazard, look to see if your thoughts are haphazard and clear them up. You already shape and affect the manner in which your daily activities unfold by the thoughts you carry, why not make those activities more consciously directed in nature? You get good at what you practice whether you practice an activity mentally or in reality. When you muse over a past situation that you handled badly, visualize 3 times exactly how you would have liked to have handled it instead. You can’t change the past, but you’ll find that when you do this visualization, your future actions will be better in similar circumstances."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"260  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Exercise 155 -- Activity Visualization R esearch has shown that when hypnotized subjects were convinced they pos- sessed a certain skill, they improved in that skill when they acted out the role under hypnosis. For instance, if a hypnotized subject was told he was a chess master, his chess playing ability improved dramatically under hypnosis. Studies have also revealed that when slower students were treated as if they were bright students, they performed better as well. The idea with both of these examples is that the more you are convinced that you can perform a certain way, the better you will respond in that direction. If there is a special activity coming up in a few days, visualize how you want it to go. If you are troubled about the potential outcome of the event, work on all the areas that you feel could be troublesome, and have them come out perfectly in your mind. If you're playing a ball game, speaking in front of people, bowling in a tournament, going with someone you like to a special place, driving to the beach or attending your first ballroom dance -- run over the activity first on a mental 'movie' and see yourself going through the activity, step by step, in a calm and successful manner. Do this several times a day for each day prior to the event. You can do this in a high speed time distorted fashion, and even slow it down to smooth out any imperfections (review \"Exercise -- Time Distortion\"). Doing a visualization before an activity allows you to feel more confident and expectant about a particular outcome. If you have trouble with this visualization, think of someone who is very good at the activity you're visualizing. Then imagine yourself as that person doing the activity. You can consciously involve yourself even further by acting as that person in reality when you do the activity. When facing a new challenge with which you have not yet acquired the necessary skills, imagine yourself going into the future and uniting with your future self, drawing to yourself the knowledge that that future self holds. Imagine yourself 1 year or 5 years from now looking back at today and viewing the overall picture. Now link with your future self and that perspective and see how much easier it is to make decisions in today’s time. You can even imagine you are talking to your future self with that future perspective. Time is the only thing that separates the two. Your future self is real and can help you know what to do right now and how to get where you want to go more quickly. Practicing these exercises will produce astonishing improvement."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  261 Exercise 156 -- Weight Control Is your weight totally dependent upon your calorie intake and the amount of your physical exercise? The various experiments in hypnosis have shown how the human mind can affect the body. What you can do under hypnosis, you can learn to do without hypnosis. Stress and tension can produce a retention of ingested materials, just as relaxation can allow a more thorough flushing and expulsion of same. Constipation, gastric difficulties and many overweight problems occur with tense, negative attitudes. By relaxing and relieving a stressful attitude, many internal problems are relieved as well. Through the power of visualization and suggestion, you can actually eat what you want and still lose weight! The elements of your ingested food can either be assimilated or passed. Your metabolic rate can either be stepped up or lowered, and you learn that you are in complete charge of all your bodily functions. As autogenic training and hypnosis have demonstrated, many physiological changes respond easily to suggestion and mental imagery. For instance, if you visualize a man sucking on a lemon, you salivate. If you imagine being buried alive or drowning, you internally experience panic. It's also easy to see how stress and nervous anxiety can replay worrisome visualizations that can affect your metabolic rate through fear. So obviously the absorption of carbohydrates, proteins and fats can be slowed down or speeded up by your emotional attitude. In one extraordinary study using hypnosis, imagery and positive auto-suggestions, female subjects actually brought about their own breast enlargement! If fatty tissue can be accumulated and guided to the localized area of the breasts for increased size, why can't fat in the localized areas of the waist, gut and thighs be decreased through a similar mental process? It can. To begin with, since your subconscious often acts on your own self-expression, don't condemn yourself about your weight. Instead compliment yourself each day with affirmations like, \"My body is perfect for me, and it is responding to positive changes\" or \"I am eating more sensibly and liking myself more.\" Such affirmations are very useful while doing the visualization exercise. The more you give yourself such positive input, the more perfect and beautiful your body will become. Also, keep a joyful mental attitude about the exercise, and it won't feel troublesome to you. Tension retains weight, so relax and let your body respond to you. Most animals maintain stable weights throughout their lifetime.

By overriding the automatic controls with your conscious mind you can shed excess fat from specific area of your body. Man does not use his olfactory sense with the same acuity as other mammals. Consciously smelling the savory essences of the food you eat affects the satiety center in the limbic system and curbs the appetite automatically. The more aromatic the dish or the environment where you eat, the less the tendency to overeat. Masticating your food well slows the eating desire, and making or blowing bubbles into each well chewed mouthful aerates the mass before swallowing for less intake as well. For a beginning exercise, sit in your easy chair and relax completely all your muscles from your toes to your head. Now imagine that a sumptuous meal has been prepared for you. Sit down at the table provided for you and savor it. Mentally relish each morsel. Smell and taste each dish prepared for you. Feel the food being bitten and going into your stomach and filling you up. Eat your dessert, and drink your favorite drink. Now feel the full feeling of satiation. You will find that if you do this visualization just before you snack, you'll be less liable to overdo it and maybe even lose the craving altogether! Before retiring for the night, talk to your fat and know that it will dissipate soon. Direct your conscious awareness into it. Massage your overweight midsection while you express assurance and visualize your fatty cells breaking up and sloughing away. Give your midsection this “expectation directive.” Visualize the microscopic process of it flushing through your system, and your allowing it to do so. Make the definitive statement, “I want to be lighter.” Think and feel yourself thinner. Stop trying to “lose” weight; then your subconscious doesn’t have to help you “find” what it hears you lost. Simply “release” the weight. Through these conscious directives, your body will respond. Some visualizations will work better for you than others, so experiment with your own creations. You could visualize your stomach already full to capacity and not needing any food intake. You could visualize your food turned to a horrible color, or with an ugly smell, or a slimy flavor. Imagine yourself small and inside your stomach filling it up. Imagine taking a pill that swells up & makes you feel full. Create whatever imagery works for you, and make it as real as possible by involving all your senses. Produce sounds, colors, tastes, smells, tactile sensations and kinesthetic feelings. Throughout the day create visualizations that will raise your metabolic rate, like jogging, swimming or making love.

You'll also find that a peculiar time distorted process will take over, and your expended real time on each visualization will be greatly shortened.

Are past occurrences or grievances acting as stumbling blocks or excuses for your not taking action toward what you want in life? A key to real empowerment in your life revolves around your ability to start each day as a clean slate, without past occurrences, behavior or episodes interfering with your progress. If you embrace the possibility of living your life NOW without getting stuck in old, negative programming, you can live your life fully, powerfully and with a fresh perspective every day. Life is only as difficult or easy as you allow it to be. W hat is your No. 1 goal, ambition or direction in life? Jot down your goal in a notebook and make a plan or an outline on what you can do to take action toward it during the next year, during the next month, next week, tomorrow and even right now. Next, write down a paragraph describing how you see yourself 5, 10 and 20 years from now after having achieved your goal. Now look at what you're written and mind walk through your goal and successfully realize it. E very day spend 15 minutes writing down your goal again, reviewing your progress and visualizing having achieved your goal. Fully associate yourself with all the details of accomplishing your goal. Imagine the surroundings, see, hear and feel whatever it entails. Put into motion whatever it takes to work toward your goal. You'll find that once you begin integrating your actions toward your committed goal, synchronistic happenings will start falling your way to assist the process. Proceed without hesitation. Be bold, and make some progress every day toward the ultimate fulfillment of your goal. If you're having trouble creating such feelings, pretend you're someone who you know does have such feelings. The key to the process is to make the commitment and get off the fence of indecision; then move into action toward your goal. Proceed with your plan without worry, and just watch the process unfold for you. Don't get stopped or stalled with details, just figure everything out along the way while you're in motion. As an exercise before opening your eyes in the morning, affirm to yourself with conscious clarity what you are committed to accomplishing for the day toward your goal.

Have you ever said \"I have no idea\" to a question put to you, when you really didn't stop to think about it at all? With just a little application of logical thought, you will find that you can easily have an idea on matters that you previously thought you had no idea about. If you take the trouble to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, many ideas will come to you. For instance, do you have any idea of what the circumference of the earth is? No, Huh? OK, let's break it down. There's a 3-hour time zone difference between the East coast and the West coast of the U.S., right? They are also about 3,000 miles apart, right? If it takes 24 hours in a day for the earth to complete one rotation on its axis, and 1 hour is equivalent to about 1,000 miles, then the earth must be about 24,000 miles in circumference, right? (It is actually 24,902.45 miles.) Are you fed up with pollution of the air, water, food and soil? Do you feel helpless about it? Do you have any idea how to stop it? Of course, you're not the president of the United States, but you ARE an exceptional thinking citizen of the U.S. As an exercise, close your eyes for a moment, and step into the feeling of being such a special individual.

How many times have you seen a club, group or business you are associated with in need of some input or something you know that you could help with, but you wound up ignoring the opportunity to assist them? Are you generally helpful to others, or only when there's something in it for you in a direct tangible way? The intangible benefits of feeling good about helping others should never be overlooked. For instance, do you insulate yourself from casual interaction with others in public places? Many people go through a normal day collecting very little information about their environment or what is happening around them. They're rarely curious enough or bold enough to ask questions from strangers. When asked questions themselves, they usually don't want to be bothered, so they respond, \"I have no idea.\" Instead of saying, \"I have no idea\" when asked a question, think of something helpful to say for the following questions and alternate with a partner. First, your partner offers something for No.1; then you offer something for No.1 and so on. Proceed as quickly as you can, but keep the flow going. 1) I'm lost in this city. How do I get to Canada from here? 2) I'm a foreigner, and I'd like to start a business in America.

When asked to demonstrate what he was learning, Marceau sat on the floor and asked Carson to lift him up. On the first try, Carson succeeded with little effort in doing so. Marceau then began to concentrate, and again sat on the floor and instructed Carson to \"lift him\" up. By Marceau focusing his weight underside, Carson struggled, but could not lift the little man up. Aikido is the self-defense art that stresses harmony with all living things. It was founded by the late Morihei Uyeshiba who stressed that all things are born of ki , translated to mean \"life force.\" The name aikido is derived from ai , meaning to combine, to love; ki , the basic energy of the universe itself; do , the path that all can take. In aikido , there are four basic principles: 1) Keep centered or balanced. One must settle his mind at one point in the lower abdomen, about 2 inches below the navel. This point is your center of gravity around which your body weight is evenly distributed. 2) Relax completely. Relaxation must be both physical and mental. The individual must allow his mind to settle down into his center of gravity without his body becoming limp. Be aware of your center when you move as well. When you walk, sense your movement originating from that point below your navel rather than leading with your head. With practice, you will begin to move more smoothly. It sometimes helps the centering process on slippery surfaces to push off on each step with the ball of the foot. 3) Keep your weight underside. Like all physical objects, the weight of every part of the human body should be on its lower region or underside. Directing your conscious awareness to your center naturally allows the weight of an individual's body to fall underside. 4) Extend you ki . All too often, the decision of the mind to move the body is not sufficiently positive and as a consequence, the action of the body is feeble. Extending your ki means to direct the body's energies positively with the mind. Each one of the four rules is a different expression of the same state of being. The first and fourth are rules of the mind. The second and third are rules of the body. Can the normal gravitational pull be affected by the polarity of your body's energy field?

On the third lift, visualize your legs connected to an unbreakable extension through the earth, and imagine your energy field pulling in tightly and flowing downward through your feet. Don't tense up your muscles or make any other attempt to help or hinder the lift, but just 'feel' yourself as heavy as lead and immovable.

Then in 1937, Koltanowski broke that record and played 34 games simultaneously! Now the record is held by J. Flesch with 52 games in 1960. Not all blindfold players agree on how they play mental chess and there is some difference of opinion regarding their methods. As George Koltanowski points out in his book, In The Dark , ...\"every blindfold player develops his own technique of retaining positions in his mind. One player memorizes all of the moves made in each game; another has a photographic mind; a third insists that he himself doesn't know...\" Visual minded masters either visualize the actual shapes of pieces on an imagined chessboard or their equivalent symbols on perhaps a flat, scaled down version like that which is represented in a book. The picture of the board is retained in their mind at any given point so that they can easily break off and do something else, then they come back to the same mental image later without difficulty. Auditory minded masters rely on reiterating the whole sequence of moves mentally before they make any subsequent move. They only see the board momentarily in their mind after they have done so. Kinesthetic minded players aren't sure how they play mental chess. They just 'feel' their way through it. Many strong players are unable to play blindfold games, because they cannot visualize in their mind the location of the different colored squares. When they use an empty chessboard in front of them though, they can play almost as well as when the pieces are on the board. One trick to master the color of the squares better is to divide the board up into 4 equal quarters. Since each quarter looks identical, memorizing one quarter allows you to understand the square colors in the other 3 quarters as well. Of course, all players use some form of mental chess during each normal game just to look ahead a few moves at hypothetical positions. Self-confidence and a belief that you have the ability to conjure up mental images is important in blindfold chess. Although it is easy to visualize a naked person of the opposite sex, you may be a bit surprised that with a little practice it is just as easy to visualize a chessboard and its pieces. The following drill is for the visual minded chess player. Place an empty chessboard 2 feet in front of you. Take several deep, abdominal breaths and relax. Now look directly at the chessboard and study the squares and their arrangement. Feel comfortable with the flow of the diagonals across the board as well as the square"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"272  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION colors. Now close your eyes and imagine the board still in front of you. See all the same features in your mind's eye this time. Hold the image for 30 seconds; then open your eyes. Compare the inner image with the outer one. Notice any aspects you were not aware of when visualizing. Close your eyes again and repeat the exercise. Next, repeat the same procedure with all the pieces on the board. After completing this, close your eyes again and visualize the pieces from different angles. Imagine yourself overtop of the chessboard looking down at the pieces or from the side of the board or from the opponent's position. This teaches you that you can move your inner conscious awareness around the chessboard at will. In the next drill, take your position as white or black and look at your starting position. Now close your eyes and make your first move. Make a comparable move in your mind for your opponent (even if you have to visualize moving to his side of the board). Do this for 6 more moves back and forth. Afterwards, open your eyes and place the pieces where they should be on the chessboard. Then close your eyes again and make 6 more moves. Open your eyes and reposition the pieces and repeat the process. If 6 moves are too many, lessen the amount, but be consistent. With practice, you should be able to increase the amount of moves gradually until a whole game is played without looking at the board. If you're having trouble holding the colored squares in your mind, you might practice making your mental moves while looking at an empty chessboard in front of you. With practice, thinking ahead 2 or 3 moves in various combinations, and coming back to your original, mental position will also be eventually mastered. Whereas ordinary visualizations are usually quite brief, blindfold chess in this manner offers duration to your visualizing abilities. It is a powerful mind strengthening exercise. As a side benefit to mastering blindfold chess, you will also improve your memory with everyday matters as well. For auditory minded players, have a friend play you a game of chess while your back is to the board. Have your friend call out his move to you every time he plays. Each time it is your turn to play, repeat mentally the whole series of moves that preceded your current move. Since your mental picture of the chessboard will not be as permanently in place in your mind as a visual minded player, you must rely on this reiteration process to flash the current position of the board at any one time. With practice, you'll find that it will only take a few seconds to do this reiteration process, and your memory powers will be greatly enhanced as well."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  273 Exercise 163 -- Time Awareness Some people have to be awakened with an alarm clock and others wake up when they want automatically.

To utilize the vast storehouse of moral opinion and knowledge in your subconscious, the invisible counselor visualization is a powerful one. Think of 2 or more people that you admire or respect because of certain attributes they possess and write their names down. Now just before going to sleep at night, imagine these people sitting at a council table with you for the purpose of solving your problems for you. Visualize an appropriate personality for each one and direct your problem to the council table for suggestions and a possible solution. Do this nightly and you'll be astounded at the individual mannerisms and characteristics each imaginary person will adopt in relating to you. This is just another method of drawing on your own inner reserve for assistance in problematic situations. Dale Carnegie credited many of his successful decisions to a similar technique where he imagined certain of the world's greatest minds sitting at a meeting of his own personal board of directors. Every time he had a problem, he would imagine going to his board of directors to seek the advice of those great minds. The answers he got from them proved quite valuable to him. A good variation of this technique is to visualize a constant companion or guide that is always with you throughout the day -- sitting alongside you in the car, chatting with you at the dinner table, walking with you on the beach, giving you love and positive encouragement, etc. For Christians, Jesus Christ is an excellent companion for a troubled person. With others, a different personage can be visualized. Carl Jung had an imaginary old sage named Philemon who often gave him strong insight into the problem areas of his life. In fact, much of the \"channeling\" of today is simply the creation of internal personality assists to guide people along. Whether you read the Bible or ancient philosophical treatises, they all steer you toward the axiom: \"The answers lie within you.\" Another variation is to fantasize new or problematic situations being properly handled by a visualized character model. By picturing somebody you respect dealing with your problems or situational circumstances ahead of time, you can more effectively see how to put yourself in such situations.

As a problem solving exercise, first review to yourself all the aspects of a specific problem in your life just before going to sleep. Write down a pertinent question to your problem. Think of this question over and over again before falling asleep. Then as you doze off, give yourself the suggestion that your subconscious mind will work out a solution in your sleep, and that you'll awaken with the answer. You can also do this with lost objects that you want to find. Mentally say to yourself, \"I need the solution to the following problem (define it), and I want to have this information at 8:00 A.M. (or whatever time you expect to awaken).\" Repeat the instruction 2 more times, then forget it and go to sleep. Afterwards you may notice a sense of peace and confidence when you awake. Perhaps you may not even know why, but you just KNOW everything will work out for you, and you just start doing the things necessary to bring about the solution. Sometimes this technique will work right away, and sometimes it may take a few trials, but keep at it and you will be pleasantly surprised. Also, keep a pencil and paper on your night table, just in case you need to jot down some information in the morning. For instance, your last dream in the morning may have a lot of symbolic meaning not readily discernible. Write it down and ask yourself later what your subconscious could be telling you. Also, since you are the best interpreter of your own dreams, ask yourself as soon as you just begin to awaken, but before rising out of bed, what the emotions you feel or symbolic aspects of the dream mean.

Humans and lab animals that have been deprived of REM sleep exhibit bizarre and often psychotic behavior. Researchers have found that your REM dream state is predominantly the alpha and theta brainwave states (4 to 7 cycles per second and 7 to 14 cycles per second respectively). D reams are ordinarily spontaneous and representative of subconscious meander- ings. They can also be a psychological release of tension. As far back as Biblical times, dreams have symbolically carried meaning (\"... and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.\" Gen. 41:8). Since dreams are often veiled in symbolism, it's important to record your dreams and periodically review them to acquaint yourself with any interpretive parallels happening in your life. After interpreting your own subconscious symbolism, dreams can open themselves up to a personal enjoyment instead of a perplexing experience. The term lucid dreaming describes the experience of consciously recognizing during a dream that you are dreaming. By involving your conscious awareness in a subconscious activity, you can learn to control the content of your dream and its course of action. The more mindful and fully conscious you are in your normal waking state, the easier it will be for you to master the lucid dreaming state. Review “Exercise -- Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness” to sharpen your lucid dreaming state. Dreams to a lucid dreamer are more vivid than simple visualizations. Objects and people appear to be and feel solid, and the dreamer is often able to converse intelligently with his own dream characters. Lucid dreamers can create or eliminate characters and items within the dream by simply wanting to do so. In dreams, you can even levitate or fly. So if you're ever in doubt of your dream state, try flying as a test. A Malaysian tribe called the Senoi revolves much of its culture around dreams. At an early age, parents question their children closely about their dreams. The children are taught early how to control their dreams and to bring about beneficial outcomes. By consciously manipulating their subconscious dreams, the Senoi manifest positive results in the waking world and resolve their daily problems more readily. One technique to achieving a lucid dream state is to ask yourself the question,"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"278  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION \"Is this a dream?\" or \"Am I dreaming?\" 10 to 20 times just before falling asleep. The conscious repetitiveness of the question will eventually be submerged into the subconscious dream state. Reflecting cognitively upon such a question in the dream state will result in some form of conscious intervention and awareness, and hence a lucid dream state will be achieved. As a variation of the former method, simply count and affirm just before retiring, \"I am dreaming, One\" -- \"I am dreaming, Two\" and so on. Attending to the counting process keeps your conscious awareness vigilant to what you intend to do. For those people who tend to fall asleep rapidly, this method can have you counting straight into dreamland. Another method is to reiterate over and over to yourself just before going to sleep, \"I am going to sleep now. I know that I will be dreaming. I will recognize that I am dreaming when I am dreaming. Tonight, I will be consciously aware of my dream. I will remember what I dream in full conscious detail.\" You can also use a stimulus response link. For instance just before going to sleep, look at your hand while reiterating to yourself over and over, \"When I see my hand in my dream, I will know I am dreaming.\" One researcher used with great success a mild electric shock to signal subject dreamers they were dreaming. Any of these techniques may initiate a flood of colors, images, sounds and thoughts. If you begin thinking in abstract ways, it usually indicates the right brain is taking over and the left brain is becoming idle. Just continue observing and the sounds and images will eventually evolve into a 3-dimensional dream that you can consciously explore, change and learn from. For recurring nightmares or fearful dreams, intensely visualize yourself actively in a more preferred scenario just before falling asleep. Imagine yourself initiating actions in the manner that is most beneficial to you so that the stage is set for the subconscious to rerun the same play in your favor. Combine your visualization with the suggestion that you are in control of your dream and that there is nothing to fear. Eventually your imagery process will merge into a dream process and positive results will be achieved. Using the above techniques will produce an ability to achieve lucid dreaming in 4 to 5 weeks or less. After achieving a lucid dream state, act only as a casual observer at first or the condition might quickly dissipate into wakefulness. Slowly integrate into your dreams volitional control and alterations, and soon full dream mastery will be achieved. If you avoid whimsical notions, you can design purposeful meaning to your dreams and achieve in the dream state that which you want in the real world. If"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  279 you want positive episodes to happen in the real world, you can now create dreams about them first. Since many remembered dreams are recollections of astral travel (esp. flying dreams), (review \"Exercises -- Astral Projection Techniques\" and \"Astral Projection Adventures\"), learning lucid dreaming can also be important in learning how to consciously remember and participate in astral journeys. There is a right to left brain shift during the night after 45 minutes; then a left to right shift after another 45 minutes. Consequently, every 90 minutes, there is a storm of neuronal activity in the right brain as it goes into its REM dream cycle for several minutes. Not surprisingly, the same brain cycle follows throughout the day as well. Ever notice how sometimes you're more prone to daydreaming while reading than at other times? Daydreaming often occurs spontaneously throughout the day and is also subconsciously oriented. This “in the back of the mind” imaging sometimes guides your thought patterns toward a preoccupation into negative thinking. Since daydreams are more easily interrupted, practice observing them when they occur. Then interject your conscious influence over the flow and outcome of the daydreams by directing them into a more positive result. If daydreams are too elusive to manage, begin with conjured up visualizations that you can create for yourself. Devise an imagined script and story and produce your own inner plays. You can also take advantage of the 45-minute brain shift cycle by practicing your visualization exercises during right brain period. Research has shown that lucid dreamers are more likely than non-lucid dreamers to have dreams that are positive, successful or filled with good fortune. It makes sense, doesn't it?

When you follow those 'hunches,' they usually pay off. Sometimes though, you don't follow your hunches and later you wish that you had. This process of listening to and following your hunches simply amounts to capitalizing on the preconscious thought processes that comprise your intuitive level of thinking. With practice, you can learn the technique of becoming aware of these subtleties and utilizing these fleeting moments of insight and intuition. As an exercise, practice during the day being still for a few minutes at a time. Suspend your thinking processes and simply 'drink in' your surroundings without evaluating anything. Close your eyes and just listen to your internal voice. Ask a question, pose a problem or express a desire; then listen for a subconscious answer. Be patient with yourself. This is not something you can force or get emotional about. Calmly think and calmly feel everything. Never be skeptical; never be excited or emotional. Just allow your intuition to express itself. Practice with some low-risk unimportant decisions at first to get yourself used to reaching that part of your mind, but practice. Occasionally guess who it is when the phone rings, or who is going to win a ball game that means little to you, or whether the stock market will go up or down for the day, etc. Keep track of your results by writing down your daily scores in a diary. Many people make wrong investments because their thinking is distorted by greed, instead of being scientifically guided by intuition. If you don't allow your emotions to cloud the issue, your intuition should grow stronger and more accurate. Above all, keep an open and positively receptive attitude toward the process. The feeling after or during deep meditation that gives you a peaceful, calm and happy feeling is the state of intuition. Exercise and be aware of this powerful state on a daily basis. Sometimes you may have a momentary flash of insight during the day, and without even trying to do anything you will have a foretelling vision of future events! The more you tune into your intuition, the easier the process becomes. Eventually you will learn to rely more and more on your intuition before making any important business, social or spiritual decisions."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  281 Exercise 169 -- Solving Problems With Intuition Intuition has been defined as a knowledge gained without rational thought, and it often includes subconsciously perceived information. It's like knowing something without knowing how you know it. Intuitive people tend to be independent and self- confident. These qualities are needed requisites to be open to this unpredictable, surprising and often unconventional source of knowledge that comes from within yourself. Nevertheless, this is a brain skill that can be learned. Now get into a comfortable, relaxed position and do some deep, abdominal breathing (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Quiet your mind. Concentrate and review your problem thoroughly from all angles with as much information as possible. Suspend your judgment; then simply 'let go' and don't think about the problem anymore. Allow yourself a sense of alert awareness. Tune in and be aware of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally. Visualize yourself on a relaxing train journey crossing the country. Feel calm and relaxed as town after town, home after home pass on by. With no thoughts of any cares or worries, you're simply observing the world go by. By letting the logical mind rest, the intuitive mind often comes up with the answers after your conscious focus has been switched away from it. Do this \"stating of the problem and letting go procedure\" just before you meditate or go to sleep and the solution will frequently pop up later. Where do these answers come from? First, they come from your own accumulated source of knowledge and experience; second, from the minds of others picked up telepathically; and third, from the universal consciousness of Infinite knowledge.

Adopt a calm and peaceful nature. Maintain a depth of thought and a focus on a continued activity in a singular direction. Devote yourself to daily introspection and analysis, and most of all, meditate and hold on to the serene aftereffects of meditation to create an intuitive state. When in a big city, almost everyone has had the experience of looking for a parking place in a congested area. Instead of cursing the situation and creating negative thought impressions, quietly ask yourself in which direction is the nearest parking space. When you get the hang of this exercise, the question turns into a knowingness and you just automatically 'home' in on the right street. You start 'listening' to your feelings as to where to go. There is a kind of an indicator off the skirt of your mind, and it's not so much in the trying as it is in the doing. Follow your initial impressions and urges as to where to look. Let your intuition be your guide and accept the fact that you CAN do it. You can use the same basic technique in looking for lost or misplaced items or a friend in a crowd. Let yourself be internally guided.

Idiot savants (often left-brain impaired) occasionally take to lightning calculating naturally with no formal training in mathematics at all. Your left brain hemisphere processes information sequentially (one part after another). Your right hemisphere uses simultaneous processing. During World War II, plane spotters were trained to count at a glance not only the number of planes that were passing by, but by their silhouettes alone, how many of each type! They didn't count 1, 2, 3, 4 or 3, 6, 9, 12, but they acknowledged them all as a group! Small children learn to count this way very easily, that is before they are discouraged from doing so. This right brain faculty is also demonstrated when carpenters size a board without using a ruler or mechanics assess a certain size wrench for a particular bolt just by looking at it. To initiate the right brain's innate ability to calculate instantaneously, count your footsteps from 1 to 100 rhythmically as you walk or run, and observe simultaneously the sights and sounds with your 'conscious awareness' while still automatically counting. When you reach 100, start all over again. When the process becomes automatic, this simple drill can be expanded to reciting the 2's table -- until that too becomes automatic. While taking a walk, estimate the number of strides that it will take to reach a certain street, tree or corner. Count the steps and check yourself. Look at a building and guess the number of floors or windows it contains. Count and verify. When you get on a bus, flash to yourself the number of people already on board, then count to double check. Look at a parking lot and guesstimate the number of autos. In your home, count the number of tiles on a wall or the number of boards in the ceiling or the number of books on a shelf -- but always at a glance, then check yourself. Open a book and glance at a particular paragraph, then close your eyes and relate the number of lines in the paragraph. With enough practice, you'll eventually be able to look at a flock of birds and instantly give the number. As a further drill, take a few dominoes and glance at them giving the total number of spots instantly. With each day of progression, add more dominoes. In lieu of dominoes, practice with a small handful of peas or beans thrown on the table, each time varying the number. With 15-30 minutes of practice per day, in a week you'll suddenly be counting instantaneously and amazing yourself.

For the auditory minded, practice with a tape recorder and a friend. Have the friend prearrange a series of calculations on paper to be read into the tape recorder for playback by you later.

Design your own variety of problems with varying complexity and press yourself for speed by having the tempo increased progressively. With practice, you'll find a 'letting go' procedure takes place and the answer just pops up! It might also help to disengage the left brain from participating in the calculations, so say the ABC's while mentally doing each mathematical problem. As another drill, have a friend read words to you from a book and you give the number of letters in them. The left brain is comfortable with counting by 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's and even by 7-item groupings before it has to slide over to the right brain for assistance in higher numbers.

One researcher, memorizing a complex one-page table, tried unsuccessfully to match the speed of the twins for quite a long time. Then suddenly, one day he discovered he could match their speed! Quite to his surprise, his brain had somehow automated the complex calculations. It had absorbed the calendar table so efficiently that the calculating process was second nature to him, and he no longer had to consciously go through the various operations. Perhaps the site of processing migrated from his left brain hemisphere (special- izing in logical, sequential, step-by-step calculating) to his right brain hemisphere (grasping patterns of information in a more holistic and simultaneous fashion).

Remember, you're never too old to learn speed mathematics. Take the example of Baron Herbert de Grote who was over 60 when he started actively working on mental calculations and at the age of 82 was in the Guiness Book of World Records for his record breaking calculations. To l earn speed multiplication, first practice with adding zeros. For example 800 times 400 has 4 zeros that are simply added to the product of 32 making 320,000. 800 x 400 320,000 Now practice with the following until it becomes automatic: 90 50 300 540 2300 3000 4000 6000 7500 x 30 x 60 x 70 x 80 x 500 x 2000 x 600 x 200 x 400 Even though this seems real easy, it must be mastered and become second nature to you before tackling what comes next. One of the consistent findings that researchers have discovered about lightning calculators is that they multiply from left to right and store only one fact away at a time. This is done in a 'moving' fashion so fast that often calculators cannot explain the procedure until they're given a complex computation that slows them down just enough to let them actually \"watch\" the mental process in motion. Their conscious self actually watches their subconscious self whiz through the calculation in a time distorted fashion (review \"Exercise -- Time Distortion\"). The process of lightning calculating has simply become automatic to them. As with any skill, regular practice brings you proficiency. You can actually learn to creatively have fun playing with numbers. Look for ways to play with numbers every day. For example, multiply how many people go into a building in one minute X 60 to get an hourly traffic guesstimation. As a right brain faculty, speed multiplication involves a reverse process of calcu- lating from left to right, as opposed to left brain calculating of right to left. You will sometimes find that you can encourage the right brain into performing calculations if you first engage your left brain in a talking or writing mode."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"288  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION The problem 349 times 462 is solved thus: 300 x 400 = 120,000 300 x 60 = 18,000 138,000 300 x 2 = 600 138,600 400 x 40 = 16,000 154,600 400 x 9 = 3,600 158,200  40 x 60 = 2,400 160,600 40 x 2 = 80 160,680 60 x 9 = 540 161,220  9 x 2 = 18 161,238 When a problem is visibly written, some lightning calculators use criss-cross multiplication.

Yes, in fact, in a month or two of consistent training, a person could appear to be a calculating prodigy. As with most things, practice is extremely important. Most lightning calculators \"play\" with numbers day and night, and they delight in finding new ways that certain numbers relate to each other. Numbers are their language, and they create harmonies with them in their minds. For centuries there have been exceptional examples of human calculators. Studies of lightning mental calculators have revealed that they primarily are either visualizers or auditory-rhythmic types (kinesthetic types have not yet been recognized). Long tables of squares, cubes, logarithms and countless other numerical facts are stored in the subconscious memories of human calculators along with hundreds of shortcut procedures in calculation. Some seem to develop their skill at an early age and have a natural flair for calculating. For instance, at the age of 3, Carl Friedrich Gauss looked at his father's weekly payroll for his laborers and said \"Father, the reckoning is wrong ... \" The child's solution turned out to be right and yet no one had taught him arithmetic! Practicing preliminary basics acquaints the mind to the shortcut techniques that eventually become automatic when the right brain takes over. It's like passing a critical threshold and suddenly a shift takes place. The calculating process is so fast that it becomes hard for the conscious mind to explain the process to a listener. To add columns of figures more rapidly, start pairing your numbers so that you think of 2 digits as one. For example: Don't add, just practice pairing the following addition columns: 7 1 3 8 5 6 4 2 9 > 10 3 5 6 3 9 4 2 9 8 4 > 13 9 4 8 1 3 8 9 4 6 8 > 17 9 9 7 2 5 7 6 2 7 26 (26)"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"290  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Practice pairing until it becomes automatic.

Although still not fully understood, hypnosis has more recently grad- uated to medicine and dentistry. The power of hypnosis comes via suggestion. Suggestion (positive or negative) can have startling effects on the mind/body combination, but how does hypnosis differ from mere suggestion? The variable is belief. Positive suggestion during hypnosis is the trigger that initiates the process of belief for a positive outcome. Throughout your day, negative and positive statements repeated enough times create a belief system for the subconscious mind to act upon. During hypnosis, suggestions somehow bypass the normal channels of debatable consideration and are simply accepted and believed. Just how readily they are believed depends upon your already established moral and psychological personality traits. Perhaps there is an area in your mind governing doubt that is quieted or circumvented completely through hypnosis. When you are hypnotized by another person, you often develop a susceptibility to the hypnotic directives of that person. With unstable individuals, there is also a potential danger that latent personality traits might manifest outwardly like spirit possession or paranoid neurosis. Therefore if improperly used, hypnosis via a hypnotist could potentially be dangerous. On the other hand, self-hypnosis is a natural way to achieve more control over your own life. There is no danger that you will not awaken or that you will suffer any harm whatsoever. W hen idiot savants illustrate memory feats, play music, create art or calculate extraordinary sums easily, it appears to be largely due to the lack of interference from the left or language side of the brain. Since you’re physically the same in or out of hypnosis, the extraordinary abilities you exhibit under hypnosis must be representative of the power within you at all times! Self-hypnosis quiets many of the interfering factors of the left brain to allow more control over your right brain functioning to take place. It's like shifting your conscious awareness to a subconscious realm. If you've mastered lucid dreaming (review \"Exercise -- Lucid Dreaming: Conscious Awareness of Your Dreams\"), you already know what a different version of the same thing feels like.

Between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind, there is an 'invisible screen.' The conscious mind can be likened to the objective reasoning area of the brain, and the subconscious mind is associated with the subjective non-reasoning area. The subconscious is amenable to suggestion and it also records all memories that happen to the individual. The 'screen' allows all information to pour into the subconscious memory, but eliciting the information back out for conscious use depends on various factors. To begin this exercise, go to your bedroom after dark and extinguish all lights except one -- about the intensity of a nightlight or candle. Arrange the light so your eyes look upwards or slightly higher than a straight ahead look. Now lie down in bed or get comfortable in an armchair. Breathe abdominally and rhythmically for a few minutes and let your mind wander. Start to relax all the muscles of your body by progressively starting with your feet and working upwards towards your head (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Bring your conscious awareness to each area of the body and allow its relaxation to take place. Do this slowly and methodically. Continue breathing deeply and steadily without strain. Now take a deep, satis- fying breath and hold it for a few seconds, and you will hear your pulse throbbing in your ears. Release it slowly. Repeat the process once again. Now affirm to yourself 3 times that all your muscles are relaxed. With your conscious awareness, recheck the whole body to confirm that no muscles have been overlooked. There should be no tension anywhere. After you do this several times, the relaxation process can be done almost instantly. Now raise your eyes so that you can see your little nightlight. There should be a slight strain on your eyes while gazing at the light. Continue looking at the light until you feel pleasantly drowsy. (In lieu of the light, you can roll your eyes toward your eyebrows and attempt to see the top of your head. Physiologically, a suggestive altered state of mind is created by simply raising your eyes upward.) Take a deep, abdominal breath. Tell yourself that your eyelids will close at the count of ten and count -- \"One - Two - Three - My eyes are heavy - Four - Five - I am becoming tired - Six - Seven - Eight - I am totally relaxed and at peace - Nine - My eyes are closing tightly - Ten - My eyes are shut.\" To go deeper, say the word \"Deeper\" over and over again and count from 11 to 20.

This is the same anchoring process you learned in “Exercise -- Anchoring Positive States of Mind.” Make sure that you clarify the goal that you want to accomplish ahead of time though, or your mind will wander aimlessly unless you implant a purpose.

Jogging, marching, dancing, swimming, rhythm, narcotics, cadence, music, chanting, flashing lights and the monotone of a hypnotist's voice can shift your awareness into a trance-like state. Rally leaders, mobs, drill sergeants, politicians, preachers, hard sell salesmen, con artists and tough teachers shut down your evaluating left brain by loud, strong or persuasive language and hit the emotional right side of the brain by displaying authority, forcefulness or by creating a state of peer acceptance in you. This exercise should be done with a partner to guide you at first, but later it can be achieved on your own. Assume a comfortable position and relax all the muscles of your body from your feet to your head (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Breathe rhythmically and deeply during this process. With your eyes closed and rolled upwards, imagine that you have a gigantic blackboard in front of you. Now visualize writing your name on the blackboard with a piece of chalk. Then write the word \"trance\" underneath it. Now again write your name and the word \"trance\" underneath it. Continue doing this over and over repeatedly until you start to feel like you are going into a trance. Now inwardly write your name again, but this time write the word \"deeper\" underneath it. Write your name and the word \"deeper\" over and over again. For visual minded individuals, this internal writing process is an excellent way to create a deep, self-induced trance. W hen you feel you are just about as deep as you can go, wait for a moment and experience a limitless, restful peace about you. Now take your chalk and write some positive affirmations on your mental blackboard to create a desired change in your life. For example, to curb the smoking habit, say to yourself, \"My body no longer needs poisonous smoke in my lungs\" or \"My body is healthier as a non-smoker.\" Picture yourself to be strong, confident and at ease with yourself. Visualize how glad that you'll feel as a non-smoker. Imagine yourself in a situation where previously you would have had a cigarette in your fingers or your mouth and now you are content without one. With practice, the whole visualization process can take less than 2 minutes.

You can practice this exercise to bring about any needed change in your life. When you want to come out of the trance state, simply suggest to yourself that you will progressively wake up as you count backwards from 10 to 1. When you reach 1, you will feel fully awake, fully refreshed and with a good happy feeling about yourself."},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  297 Exercise 178 -- Time Distortion Your perception of time does not always adhere to \"world time.\" If a man with a bass voice reads a script at exactly the same speed as a man with a tenor voice, the bass voice sounds as though he's reading more slowly. When your body temperature is high, your sense of time is also slowed. In one experiment, subjects with fevers were asked to count to 60 at one number per second. They counted to 60 in much less time than a minute. Other subjects with low body temperatures counted slower, because their sense of time was speeded up. It was also found that under the influence of blue light, time is likely to be underestimated. Under the long wavelengths of red light, time is overestimated and feels like it is in slow motion. When you're young, time appears to move slower than when you grow older. Time is often a subjective experience and seems to almost stand still when you're intensely longing for something. For instance, people in pain often experience this slow down in time, because they're longing for relief. Conversely, when you are experiencing pleasure and fun, time seems to fly. To experiment, the next time you take a long car trip, you can actually 'shorten' your elapsed travel time by thinking of the feeling of intense anticipation and longing. Hold in your mind that kind of mood and feel yourself intensely longing for something throughout the trip. You'll be surprised at the results. A 40-minute cross-town trip can be reduced to 20 minutes, and the reason for it defies current scientific explanation! As Einstein pointed out, time flows at different rates for each person's perception. John Brodie of the San Francisco 49er’s football team experienced an effect during moments of playing time where he perceived things around him moving slower than usual, giving him a longer time to observe, plan and react. Practicing meditators have a distinct advantage for they accustom themselves to these relaxed states of slower brain waves where moments of timelessness can be experienced. Perhaps consciousness is merely an appearance of separate, sequential flashes or frames of awareness. Some people experience their whole life flash before their eyes in a matter of seconds just prior to a sudden death-risking situation. Also dream researchers have discovered that a one minute dream sometimes feels like hours to a dreamer. In one experiment, hypnotized subjects were given imaginary tasks to perform in their minds -- like designing a dress and preparing a complicated meal. They were tricked into thinking they had an hour to accomplish their tasks, but they really had only 10 seconds. After 10 seconds had elapsed in world time, the hypnotized sub-"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"298  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION jects experienced intricate and accurate detail in their inner perception that seemed to them to be a complete hour! Given the same tasks in the waking state often stymied them so badly that they couldn't think of a single dress design and actually prepared a meal in a very disorganized fashion. A posthypnotic interview revealed that the subjects experienced no difference in their \"thinking\" and that at no time did they feel hurried or speeded up. Time distorted thought thus seems to have superior clarity to normal conscious thought beset with constant distraction. B egin this exercise by assuming a very relaxed state to achieve the rapport necessary to create an alteration of perceived time. Next, review \"Exercise - Learning Self-Hypnosis\" and achieve a self-hypnotic state. To initiate progress in time distortion, begin with remembering your morning hours in a quick succession of mental flashes -- from getting out of bed to going about your morning activities. Now recall the hours after that and so on. Using your imagination, this will become easy and should be practiced frequently. N ext, visualize seeing a recent movie that you're familiar with and start at the beginning and whiz through to the end. Since most movies are about 2 hours long, reviewing them in a matter of seconds will show you that you are progressing. Next, mentally go to a familiar window in your house that overlooks some vegetation or trees. Now visualize the seasons rapidly changing before your eyes (rain, snow, sun, defoliation, rebudding, etc.) as 12 months pass by you like you are in a time machine. Next, imagine you are superman (or supergirl) and you are swiftly flying around the world very close to the ground while taking in all the scenes and wonders as they flash by you. These drills give you practice in consciously thinking fast as well as improving your conscious memory of daily events. Practice these visualizations often and soon you will see how easy they become. After each drill, you can bring yourself out of the self-hypnotic state by counting backwards from 10 to 1 and progressively awaken. Have you ever had the experience of looking at your watch or clock with a sweep second hand only to find that it appeared stopped; then after a moment of shock, watch it start moving again? There is a direct relationship between slower brain waves and time appearing to slow down. This is your perceptual subjective time. As an exercise, get in a comfortable seated position in front of a clock with a sweep hand. Look at the clock while progressively relaxing your body and mind (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Now close your eyes, relax completely and visualize some activity with a feeling of intense anticipation or long-"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  299 ing. Experience your visualization with all your sense. When you have achieved the visualization and feeling, open your eyes slightly and look at the clock. You should see the sweep hand stick or stop in a few places. After practicing this exercise, you eventually will be able to slow or stop time consistently for varying periods of time as you experience a slower brain wave output. Since time distortion does not always depend upon slower brain waves, you can help the effect by reiterating the suggestions in \"Exercise -- Learn Through Time Distortion.\" To monitor your progress with time distortion, have a friend help you or set up a 10-second timer for yourself. During 10 seconds, mentally and in a time distorted state count on your fingers the number of times you can say, \"I am getting better and better at distorting time.\" Then say the same sentence aloud as many times as you can and compare the two. When your mind goes into hyperdrive, you'll be amazed at how many times you can say the sentence in 10 seconds of world time. You'll find the more you practice any visualization, the more vivid it becomes, and that a peculiar time distorted process will take over and your expended \"real time\" on each visualization will be greatly shortened. By learning how to click your mental button to go into a time distorted mode, formerly stressful situations will become easier to handle, problems will become easier to solve, and you'll find that you'll have all the time you need for any situation that confronts you."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"300  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Exercise 179 -- Learn Through Time Distortion In this hectic fast pace world, accelerated learning techniques are becoming increasingly more valuable. Learning through time distortion is harnessing the sub- conscious through conscious direction. \"Instant\" mental calculators and high speed readers (over 2,000 wpm) experience a sense of time distortion as information flashes through their mind in only seconds. Through self-hypnosis, you too can learn to review information in a time distorted fashion. As an example, one concert violinist put herself into a self-hypnotic trance and through self-induced time distortion practiced her music in several different ways. By \"playing\" the difficult spots mentally, it helped her finger memory to improve in speed and accuracy. She was able to review long pieces over and over in very brief \"world\" time periods, and her technique and technical performance improved strikingly. By repeating memorized material in a time distorted fashion, valuable associative patterns can be firmly established and conscious recall becomes more available. Using time distortion, problems can be reviewed and approached from all angles in a matter of seconds. Hypothetical lectures, appointments and scenes can be laid out in your mind, prepared for and visualized in a brief amount of time. Kinesthetic body movements in gymnastics or the martial arts can be reviewed in this way as well. Doing 'instantaneous' calculations and high speed mathematics can be learned with time distortion. In a similar way solutions to everyday problems can be achieved effortlessly and quickly. By simple trusting your subconscious mind, you establish a better awareness and faith in your own abilities. A fter reviewing and becoming proficient with \"Exercise - Time Distortion,\" you are ready to apply the technique to learning. In one experiment, a hypnotist told subjects that they had one hour to do an activity (e.g. housework, picnic, car trip, swimming, shopping, watching TV, etc.), but in reality he gave them only seconds in 'world' time to accomplish their task. Afterwards, it was found that the hypnotized subjects created in their mind a full hour's worth of detailed experiences without difficulty. The experiment was achieved by starting a metronome at 60 beats per minute while the hypnotist stated that he was slowing it down gradually. The subject was to listen carefully as he did so and when in the subject's opinion the metronome had been slowed down to the rate of one stroke per minute, the subject would acknowledge by saying, \"Now.\" The metronome's beating always remained the"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  301 same, but the hypnotist progressively encouraged the state of suggestibility in the subject by saying that the metronome was going still slower. The same suggestibility can be achieved in a self-hypnotic state. Use an audible second-ticking clock or a metronome stroking at 60 beats per minute. Assume a comfortable position in a chair or a bed, and achieve a self- hypnotic state (review \"Exercise -- Learning Self-Hypnosis\"). After getting into a deeply relaxed state, your heartbeat will entrain itself to the slow rhythm of 60 beats per minute. Concentrate on deep rhythmic breathing and clear your mind to allow your brain waves to also slow down. You can memorize and say the following suggestions to yourself or you can put them on a cassette tape for playback when you're relaxed. 1) I am feeling good. I am feeling wonderful. 2) The beats are slowing now -- slower - slower. 3) The time between each beat is seeming longer and longer. 4) I am relaxed and I have lots of time. 5) Time is only relative to what I want it to be. 6) Each stroke is further and further apart now. 7) There is lots of time. 8) I feel so relaxed, calm and at peace with myself. 9) Time is slowing down. 10) Each beat of the metronome feels distantly separated. R epeat the above suggestions or similar ones over and over to yourself until you \"feel\" that each click of the metronome is spaced between 2 - 4 minutes apart. Bring into mental focus the material you want to review and say the following: 1) I have plenty of time to review this. 2) Every time I do this, I improve myself and my performance. 3) I am relaxed and taking my time. 4) The more I practice, the easier it becomes. 5) I am feeling good and experiencing no hurry. 6) I have all the time that I need to accomplish this review. 7) I am completing my review. At this suggestive state of mind, you can review any material you wish in a matter of seconds over and over again. By being relaxed and saying to yourself that you have lots of time, your mind does indeed 'create' lots of time. You work at optimal levels of efficiency when you are relaxed and enjoying yourself.

Bring yourself out of the self-hypnotic state by counting backwards from 10 to 1 and then progressively awaken.

Relax your body completely and breathe rhythmically and deeply into your abdomen. Now begin looking at your image in the mirror. Concentrate your attention intently upon your right eye without blinking and instruct yourself to progressively relax deeper and deeper (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Now ask yourself softly, \"Who have I been?\" Keep breathing deeply and rhythmically while repeating the question over and over. Soon you will 'see' changes take place in your face and body. Different clothes, skin tone, hair length and even sex changes may become apparent. As your images come and go, stop from time to time and hold onto an image. Ask questions of it concerning your life and experiences, then move on to others.

It is not hypnotic and it ordinarily conjures up images that heretofore you had no conscious awareness of. Whatever your philosophy, it surely is interesting. Have a partner assume a relaxed, prone position on a couch or bed. Guide your partner in some deep, rhythmic breathing (review the breathing exercises.) With his eyes closed, have him relax his whole body from his toes to his head (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\"). Now have your partner partici- pate in the following mind-expanding visualizations. First, have him imagine that he is blowing up like a balloon -- larger and larger, while feeling himself getting bloated and round. Let him feel himself getting as big as the room, as big as the house or as big as he can imagine and let him tell you when he is at that maximum point of feeling big by saying, \"OK.\" Now tell your partner to reduce his size gradually down to normal size again. Next, have your partner visualize himself getting smaller and smaller like a shrinking man. Let him feel the shrinking process as he grows smaller and smaller until he is as small as he can imagine. Then let him acknowledge this maximum point by saying, \"OK.\" Afterwards, slowly return him to normal size again. Now let him imagine that he is growing tall and large like a giant -- becoming taller and taller until he reaches the maximum height he can imagine for himself. Let him indicate at this point by saying, \"OK.\" Then bring him slowly back to normal size again. Afterwards, let him visualize that he is growing squatter and squatter -- like a great weight is pressing on his head down to his feet and squashing him like a pancake. Guide him in this process and when he has become as squat as he can imagine, let him indicate by saying, \"OK.\" Now guide him back to normal size again. Now let him imagine that he is extending himself out like an elastic man. His head and chest are stretching in one direction and his feet and legs are stretching out in the other direction -- further and further until he has stretched himself out as far as he can imagine. Let him acknowledge this maximum point by saying, \"OK.\" This time, tell him to snap back sharply like a rubber band to normal size again. Now let him imagine himself zooming up out of the room and above the building, hovering there for a moment then zooming higher and higher -- way above the city into the stratosphere. Suggest the following to him: \"Hover at this point and look around you and beneath you. Everything looks so distant.

Now come back very quickly to earth with a sudden thud.\" Proceed with the following queries and allow him time for any responses: \"Describe now what is at your feet. What are you wearing? Look at the rest of your body. What kind of clothes do you have on? Look around you. Are there any animals, plants, people or buildings nearby? Describe them. Go to where you live. How old are you? Are you married? Do you have any children? What do you do for a living?\" Continue with these or similar questions for a thorough description of that time period. Then have your partner zoom back up into the stratosphere and come down quickly in a similar fashion for as many \"lifetimes\" as you wish to review. You can even suggest that he come down into a lifetime that has the most influence on his current incarnation, and ask him what he did then that is affecting him now. After reviewing the episode, a 'clearing' effect is often the result.

During mental projection, it feels like an imaging process is taking place. As science progresses, we'll no doubt learn more about these subtle projections; but for now we can at least experiment and observe our results. As an example of the power of mental projection, healer Olga Worrall placed her hands at each end of a Wilson Cloud Chamber without touching it. She imagined healing energies flowing from her hands into the chamber. Within 30 seconds the mist began to pulsate and dark waves became visible. The experiment was repeated while Olga was 600 miles from the apparatus, and the same results were achieved when she only visualized her hands at each end of the chamber directing her energies into it! As an exercise, assume a comfortable, relaxed position and do some deep, abdominal breathing. Imagine projecting your mental body out of your physical body so that it is hovering over and looking down on your relaxed body. Look at your clothes, hair, body position, etc. and feel totally comfortable. Now imagine you are zooming up through the ceiling and out of the building. Pause for a few seconds and look back at the areas surrounding the building, then project yourself onward. Speed by familiar parks, houses, stores and watch the traffic passing underneath you. Now proceed over to a friend's house. Go inside and view the different rooms and see if anybody is at home. Listen to the sounds of any animals or conversations. Take note of anything out of the ordinary -- new faces, items or happenings. Then exit the house and return to your own location. Look at your body briefly and then resume your normal occupancy. Write down or draw what you saw; then call your friend up to see how close you came. Such mental projections are far easier to do than astral projections. The speed of the mental body is as great as the speed of thought. If there is no direct perception of where you are going, the places become imagination. When there is perceptual knowledge, imagination turns to reality. With practice, they become less imagination and more substantial projection."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  307 Exercise 183 -- Mental Projection Into Objects All animate and inanimate things are in a state of vibration; and in that respect, any vibrational field emitted by one thing at the subatomic level affects all vibrational fields of other things around it -- whether it be directly or indirectly. Whereas psychometry is a discerning form of attunement to the vibrations of objects that are handled, this exercise deals with getting you into sympathetic vibration with an object by merging your mentally projected body into that object. This form of 'imaginative' travel frees you from the spatial limitations that you normally experience. Whether the impressions that you perceive in this exercise are correct or not, they at least represent an experience with a different perspective. As an exercise, assume a relaxed position in a chair or couch and do some deep, rhythmic breathing (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\" and the breathing exercises). With your eyes closed, imagine yourself blowing up like a balloon -- larger and larger, while 'feeling' yourself getting bloated and round. Let yourself get as big as the room, as big as the house or as big as you can imagine yourself being, then stop and 'feel' yourself that way. Now reduce yourself gradually down to normal size again. Next, visualize yourself getting smaller and smaller like a shrinking man. Let yourself 'feel' the shrinking process as you grow smaller and smaller until you are as small as you possibly can imagine, then stop and 'feel' yourself that way. Now use a crystal, a rock or other object and imagine yourself going inside it. Once inside, explore around with your senses. What does it look and feel like? Are there any sounds, tastes or smells present? Experience and take note of them. Now come out of the object and increase yourself to normal size again.

They depict incredibly detailed pictures of people, animals and structures! Just as we are now impressing pictures and information on computer chips of tiny crystals with laser beams, perhaps the ancients did something similar with pictures in rocks.

There also appears to be about a 3 ounce weight loss when the astral body leaves the physical body, according to the Monroe Institute. This indicates the astral body has a molecular mass. Surprising to Westerners is the fact that almost everyone's astral body leaves the physical body during sleep. Many of your dreams and nightmares come from experiences in the astral realm. Some people even experience 'out of the body' episodes when they have surgical operations under anesthesia. As an exercise, choose a time when you're completely alone. Lie down and relax in a comfortable position (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\") and take 10 to 20 deep, abdominal breaths. Now while breathing slowly and with your eyes closed, imagine yourself in a room on the second floor of a house. There is a window in front of you. Go to the window and open it. Imagine yourself floating out of the window and looking down at the ground. Now float back into the room and over to your body lying on the bed. (You could also visualize the sensation of falling through the air once you're out of the window.) Hover over your body from 6 feet in the air and look down at yourself. Concentrate and feel your conscious awareness hovering at a point 6 feet above you. Imagine yourself very light and observing your own body features from 6 feet away (review \"Exercise -- Pain Control Via Detachment\"). Think and practice. With practice, you will suddenly experience a mild buzzing or almost an electric shock as the separation is made, but DON'T be afraid. Then suddenly you will 'see' your body lying with closed eyes some 6 feet beneath you. If you experience fear at this point, you will be 'reeled' back into your physical body immediately. Fear is a discordant vibration in the astral realm, so wait until another day to do the exercise again. Actually, astral travel is easy as long as you understand that you CAN do it. It may take days of practicing the technique, but you can do it. Here is another way of projecting your astral self from your physical body. Again, lie flat on your back in a relaxed, comfortable position and close your eyes. This time imagine a ghostly shape the size of your body slowly rising from your physical body and floating upwards like a puff of smoke. The first few times you do this, you may notice that you start twitching slightly or vibrating. This is good, because it means you are about to separate from your physical shell. Simply relax and let the separation take place. Let your astral body rise to within a few feet from your physical body. It will take practice, but if you continue to imagine that you can"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"310  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION do it, you'll do it. To assist the process, you might repeat an affirmation ahead of time to alert the subconscious. For instance say, \"I am projecting my astral body from my physical body.\" Say this affirmation 3 times in exactly the same way. Since you are always stating all kinds of things, an affirmation stated once does not alert the subconscious. If stated twice, the subconscious begins to take notice. Repeated the third time, the subconscious becomes receptively aware and records the affirmation for responsive use. You might want to experiment by giving yourself an affirmation before going to bed. You can say something like, “I will be fully conscious when my body falls asleep. I will be fully alert and will remember in full conscious detail what I am experiencing. I desire to go out of the body and explore this state with all my awareness.” You can say this affirmation to yourself 3 times, and then go to sleep. You can also affirm to yourself 3 times your desire to astrally visit and learn something specific from a distant library or country before retiring for the night. Some people also find it easier to travel astrally when they are uncomfortable -- cold, hungry or maybe with indigestion. Presumably the astral body becomes sick of being in the physical body. Drunkards suffering from delusions often slip out of the physical body and witness things they don't understand. Since alcohol is a poison and definitely destructive to the body, it is not recommended to get drunk to leave the body.

Since your astral body is your emotional body, unstable people should not dabble into things that could only confuse them even more.)"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  311 Exercise 185 -- Astral Projection Adventures A fter achieving an astral projection (see \"Exercise -- Astral Projection Techniques\"), what do you do then? Since you cannot fall or hurt yourself, do some exploring and drift about the room from ceiling to closet, but stay calm. The first time that you are out of the body CONSCIOUSLY will be a totally new experience, so don't become too startled by it. Hover near your body and scrutinize it. A little shocking, isn't it? You never saw all the imperfections so vividly before?! It's like the first time you heard your own voice on a tape recorder. You didn't quite believe it was you! You'll notice the shape of all parts of your body, your complexion, the lines in your face, etc. If you advance a little further and look into your brain, you'll see little quirks and phobias that may even cause you to jump back into your body out of sheer fright! After this initial encounter with yourself, you'll have to decide what to do next. Perhaps you can visit a close friend or relative. If so, visualize the person in considerable detail. Visualize where he or she lives and precisely how to get there. Since astral travel is new to you, project yourself along the same route that you would normally take to get to their house. By doing this, you'll find that almost instantly you'll be there. Once there, you may even have a conversation with your friend, but since you are not conversing with his physical self, he probably will not remember it later. If he remembers anything, it may only seem like a wispy dream from his subconscious. If his level of awareness is higher, he might remember everything. With practice, you will find that you can visit any place -- high mountains, sacred temples, secret libraries (for all languages are interpretable in the astral), even the moon or other planets! By sleeping on your books and extending your astral body a short distance into them, you can even assimilate their contents into your subconscious. Making conscious use of the subconscious well of knowledge takes a little more practice. When you're on an astral journey it's impossible for you to get lost or to harm yourself or to find that your body has been taken over. If another entity comes near your physical body while you are out of it, you will be reeled in with the speed of thought. So DON'T be afraid. You may meet lower and higher forms of life in the astral, but remember, they can do you NO harm. Your own fear is the only real harm you can incur. You will find that in the astral, colors appear more brilliant that in the physical. You will also find that if you want to go to one place and a stray thought about another place occurs, your path is immediately directed to the other place.

Sometimes if you go back suddenly and clumsily, there will be a misaligning that takes place. You may find that you will physically rise up with a headache of some kind. If this happens, simply sleep for a little while and allow the alignment to readjust itself naturally. Once back in the body though, you will almost find a sensation of disappointment.

For this exercise, work with a partner until you become proficient. Then afterwards, you can work on your own. Assume a self-hypnotic state (review \"Exercise -- Learning Self-Hypnosis\") and tell your partner when you have achieved it. Now have your partner tell you the full name, address, age and sex of a person that he knows very well, but that you don't know at all. Now visualize this person in your mind's eye. Let your partner guide you by asking you questions about the subject. Do you perceive any abnormalities or unhealthy conditions present in the subject? Scan the body from head to toe and pick out any areas that attract your attention. First impressions are important, so speak up when you see something. Your partner should also remember only to give you positive feedback regarding your successful \"hits.\" In other words, if you perceive a trouble spot in the leg and the subject recently fractured his leg, have your partner say, \"That's correct!\" If there was no trouble with the leg to his knowledge, simply have your partner say, \"I have no information regarding that area.\" Imagine yourself entering into the subject's body (review \"Exercise -- Role Taking As An Actor\") and experiencing what it feels like. How much does the subject weigh? How tall is the subject? Does the subject wear glasses? Does the subject smoke? What is the subject's personality like? Have your partner tell you when you score a hit, but instruct your partner only to say, \"I have no information regarding that area,\" when he thinks you are wrong. Many times later on, your partner may learn that you were indeed correct on some area that he thought you were wrong on before. In any event, a positive encouraging air is better for your reception that a negative one. Also, only do this exercise with the air of helping people, not hindering them. As you practice, you will get more and more accurate. Eventually, you will be able to 'call up' the image of anyone for examination and ask your inner self where any problems lie. Afterwards, you can visualize yourself soothing and healing the affected area. Any energies directed in this way are of benefit (review \"Exercise -- Sending Energy To Someone\"). In concluding this exercise, you can come out of the self-hypnotic state by simply suggesting to yourself that you will progressively awaken as you count backwards from 10 -1."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"314  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION As a variation to this exercise, have your partner visualize the person to be examined. As your partner holds onto this visualization in his mind, dangle a pendulum (review \"Exercise -- Divining, Dowsing or Radiesthesia\") over an anatomical chart of Homo sapiens , working from the head to the toes slowly. When the pendulum begins to circle, ask your partner about that area of the body. The clearer your partner's visualization of the subject, the better your success at diagnosis will be.

Using remote viewing, general environmental locations are perceived more readily than numbers, letters and minute details. The reason for this is because there is a great deal of interfering 'mental noise' in the minds of most people, and a general lack of proper concentration. Consequently, your imagination attempts to make up for what is confused or unclear. Usually though, parapsychologists have had success in more than half their experimental trials, whether they're dealing with present-time or precognitive ESP. You also seem to do better when you are excited and positively expectant about results -- and of course practice allows you to perfect the skill. Also don't let your ego block you. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't. No big deal. Don't feel bad about it. Do it again another time. To begin the exercise, do some rhythmic, deep breathing and assume a com- fortable position in a chair or lie prone on a couch. Relax all your muscles from your toes to your head in a progressively thorough fashion. The more of an alpha/theta brain wave state that you can achieve, the better. Now, working with a partner to serve as the 'beacon,' designate a specific time when your partner is to reach a particular target site (a fountain, park, building, beach, etc.). Have the beacon arrive on time and have him think only of the site. Look at a picture of the beacon or visualize his face and ask, \"Where are you?\" At the designated time, have a friend act as your interviewer to ask you questions about what your first mental impressions are concerning the site. Don't analyze or force your impressions, just let them flow to you. Besides what you are seeing, are you experiencing any sounds, smells or tactile sensations? Your interviewer can say, \"Why don't you drift up in the air and tell me what it looks like from there?\" or \"Enter the beacon's body and look through his eyes.\" As a variation of this exercise, select a definite time to have a partner hold a household object at a specific location (home or office) and describe it to you mentally. In this case, imagine what it would be like to hold the object. Fully associate yourself with the imagery. What is its smell or what emotional reaction do you pick up? How heavy is it? Are there different parts to it? Afterwards, discuss with your partner over the phone your impressions. As an alternative experiment, designate a specific time to tune into a friend during his daily activities. At the same time, let him do likewise with you.

Does he have a headache? Is he worried about pressures at work? Is he planning or creating a project? Discuss with each other your impressions afterwards. A variation of the exercise can be done through the Ganzfeld sensory deprivation approach. While listening to white noise through a headset, the halves of a ping pong ball adhered over your eyes are bathed in red light. During the sender's viewing period, you describe any imagery, sounds, feelings or sensations that come into your mind. It must also be emphasized that the clearer you are in your own mind at the time that you do this exercise or any telepathy exercise, the better your result. If you are stressed emotionally in any way, resultant clarity in your mind can be skewed. Master the necessary Emotional Management Section exercises, especially the “Exercise -- Honesty For Better Clarity,” before even attempting to do any Telepathy exercise. If deceit, disloyalty, secretiveness, false promises, half truths and the habit of saying one thing and doing something else are your habit, any real mental clarity can hardly be achieved enough to accomplish this exercise or any Telepathy exercise."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  317 Exercise 188 -- Visual Telepathy Since Peter Hurkos and other telepaths have exhibited their telepathic abilities inside a Faraday cage, (a copper-walled enclosure with 25,000 volts of electricity shielding out even radio waves), thought energy does not solely function along electromagnetic theorems. If fact, ESP experiments were performed at a phenom- enally higher success rate with this screening out of interfering, electromagnetic carrier waves of extraneous energies (see \"Exercise -- Psionic and Psychotronic Generators). Telepathy often seems augmented or combined with other energies like radio- microwaves, but at other times it acts totally independent of electromagnetic influence. It appears that belief and faith are the thought processes that mostly affect the energy, combined with honesty and the positive higher emotions of love, compassion and happiness. Practice trusting and loving yourself; and be truthful with yourself to allow your telepathic ability to improve. Honesty gives you clarity by clearing away the blockages of muddled and secretive thinking (review “Exercise - - Honesty For Better Clarity”). Then focus to differentiate your own thoughts from those of others. At the very least, leave the possibility open in your mind that you can telepathically communicate. Now take a partner of the opposite sex and sit in a relaxed position facing each other. Silently look into each other's eyes. Many feelings can be discerned by this form of eye contact. As the sender, focus on one of these feelings to the exclusion of all others and emanate this to your partner. Eliminate any negative feelings and concentrate on positive ones -- love, compassion, joy, humbleness, tolerance, forgiveness, charity, friendliness, self-sacrifice or even curiosity or determination. Positive feelings always have a smoother frequency for transmitting purposes. With practice, such feelings can be transmitted quite easily. Now for this exercise, you need to clip various pictures from magazines dis- playing emotion-arousing scenes, like a kissing couple, a nursing baby, a starving Ethiopian child, a dying animal from an oil slick, a child playing, a leper, a praying nun, etc. Whatever emotion each picture generates in you, hold onto that feeling as a carrier wave to transmit each picture to a partner acting as the telepathic receiver. Keep your transmission as clear as possible during this process to allow the purity of the experience to unfold. If necessary, visualize yourself with a gag in your mouth to quiet any internal verbalization. How clearly a thought is transmitted depends on your ability to concentrate. If conflicting thoughts intervene, the recipient will receive"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"318  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION a blur. It is interesting to note that since deaf and dumb people think more visually, they are often clearer telepathic senders of pictures. Visualizing what you want to send while in the alpha/theta brain wave frequency (4 - 14 cycles per second) produces the clarity necessary for effective transmission of thought forms. The earth resonates at 7.5 - 7.83 cycles per second, and synchro- nizing your brain wave output to this exact frequency produces natural amplitude to your telepathic energy. Thought projections are associated with ELF (extremely low frequency) energy on the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum with very long wavelengths. With sufficient amplitude, you can telepathically transmit ELF waves of illusion to onlookers and phase lock their minds into seeing something that's not really there. The Indian fakir's rope trick is just one such illusion. The Indian rope trick involves an illusion telepathically sent by the fakir into the minds of all the subconsciously susceptible onlookers. Everyone except the occasional consciously aware person will be duped into seeing a scene that does not exist. Wolf Messing was a reputed telepath that could send a visual illusion with such clarity that he once got past Stalin's bodyguards by implanting the thought in their minds that he looked like the head of the Soviet secret police. For further proof of his power, he staged a fake robbery of a Soviet bank by pushing a blank piece of paper to the teller and implanting the visual illusion that it was a negotiable check for 100,000 rubles. Since most people's minds are running on unconscious levels throughout the day, consciously synchronizing your thought vibrations can create resonant wave-locks with their minds. When you transmit a clear and focused message to a unconsciously functioning person, the illusion is established. By choosing the right moment, a telepathic visualization coupled with the proper verbal suggestion can work wonders. For instance, the aforementioned bank teller and bodyguards were expecting what they saw. Choosing the right moment is waiting until the person asks you into his 'sphere' by accosting or questioning you. You can even create the illusion of invisibility through this technique of entrainment. By entraining someone's mind into a resonant frequency with your own mind (like a strobe light brings about epileptic seizures in some people), you can implant the visualization of invisibility. Remem ber, a person sees or perceives you with his brain, not his eyes . A highly skilled person can simply reflect back your eye beam energy with an illusion of his own, rather than with what is really perceivable. Sometimes the illusion of invisibility can be achieved by visualizing a person's sight buttons being shut-off, or that the light is not reflecting your image back toward the person's eyes."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  319 Exercise 189 -- Audio Telepathy Research has revealed that telepathic information is carried by extremely low frequency (ELF) waves. Just as sea salt is used to 'clear' crystals of accumulated vibrations (see \"Exercise -- Using Quartz Crystals\"), telepathic subjects in submarines often get muddled impressions in very deep seawater when trying to pick up target subjects miles away on dry land. Telepathic ELF waves have very long wave lengths and can pass through almost anything except very deep seawater. Of course, the Navy has succeeded in projecting electronic ELF waves through sea water with amplified generators, so it all depends on amplitude. At least 50 - 75% of the idle thoughts coming into your mind are simply being picked up from other minds around you. We are always sending and receiving impressions from other minds on a subtle level that coalesce and form many of our ideas and thought processes. We just don’t know the source or even that it is happening. We think we are the originators of all our ideas. The trick is to tune that delicate thought receiver in your head and pick out the thoughts you want to receive. That's a telepath. Identical twins often find it easy to do this with each other because of their similar vibrational patterns, but how can you do it? As an exercise, practice with a partner (preferably someone you know well) in a separate room. Assume a comfortable, relaxed position and take a few deep breaths. Affirm to yourself that you believe you are telepathically receptive. Still your mind by visualizing a large blackboard or a giant snowbank. Now look at a photograph of the person in the other room and visualize that person in your mind's eye. Establishing this conscious awareness of the sender helps you to produce a resonant frequency and enhances telepathic reception. Ask yourself, \"What is this person saying to me?\" Frame your thoughts, and say to the photograph mentally, \"Talk to me, talk to me.\" Then await a reply. After a while, you'll get a stirring inside your brain. At first you might say it's just imagination, but don't. If you dismiss your receptivity to idle imagination, you'll dismiss telepathy. Let the sender transmit a verbal message that contains emotionally provocative words for better reception. Also, let the sender experiment with sending emotional words in a foreign language (unknown to you) and see what happens. Have the sender pulse out his message to you through rhythmic breathing (see \"Exercise -- Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes\") as he visual- izes your face in his mind's eye. Rhythm has been shown to greatly assist telepathic abilities. Pulsing the message in a steady beat facilitates the transmission process."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"320  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Slow pulsing strobes on closed eyes have proven helpful, but synchronizing your breathing with the beat of your heart is more natural. If you use a metronome at 60 beats per minute, your heart will soon simulate that same relaxed rhythm and your brain wave cycle will slow to alpha in response. Some people improve their reception by visualizing a mental body movement in seeking the target answer. The receiver imagines he is skating in a slow, pulsing rhythm toward and around the sender. If the sender is in the same room, a metronome beating at 60 strokes per minute can be heard by both sender and receiver. The sender can then easily synchronize his rhythm as well. He visualizes his mental body moving toward and around the receiver in exactly the same rhythm. This rhythmic rapport greatly facilitates transmission and reception. You might also visualize holding onto a giant, grandfather clock pendulum that is swaying back and forth to the beat of the metronome. Hanging suspended in midair, you mentally approach your telepathic partner in a side to side rhythm. In either case, feel the kinesthetic inner movement for maximum effect. N ext, both you and your partner listen to 5 distinctly different musical pieces. Mentally without telling your partner, choose one of them for yourself. Now sit facing each other and begin emanating a positive feeling to your partner to the exclusion of all other thoughts. Now begin playing in your mind the musical piece you chose out of the 5 while maintaining your positive emotional transmission. Did your partner succeed in picking up the musical sounds? A side benefit to this exercise is that every time the transmitter hears that same musical piece in the future, the same generated emotion may be aroused! The next time you're talking to a friend, prearrange ahead of time that it is okay to interrupt each other by announcing telepathic impressions that the other feels he is receiving. Be honest with each other and experiment with different methods. One final note: Use telepathy to help people, and with practice in telepathic listening, you'll even discern messages in unknown languages as well (see \"Exercise -- Understanding Any Spoken Language\")."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  321 Exercise 190 -- Sensory Telepathy In an experiment with married couples, wives were hooked up to measure their galvanic skin response to stress while their husbands in a nearby room were shown photographs that included some pictures of ex-girlfriends. Whenever a husband looked at a former love, his wife was consciously unaware of it, but her subconscious reacted to it and registered a change on the instrument graph. In a similar experiment, husbands in another room plunged their feet into buckets of ice water. Even though their wives were unaware of their ordeal in the next room, instruments registered a greater variant response than with those wives whose husbands had no such stress subjected to them. On a subliminal or subconscious level, they were picking up the reactions of their spouses. Some of the best success ratios in telepathic reception have resulted when the perceivers \"locked\" in on the emotional frequency generated by the transmitter. A message with strong emotional content has an increased amplitude. For instance, you can often 'sense' anger in a room after a violent argument. Similarly, emotional longing, love or an expectant attitude also gives amplitude to transmissions. Therefore it would be far more sensible to use picture cards that evoked strong emotion for ESP testing than simple symbol cards. Previous exercises have covered sight and sound telepathy. This exercise covers gustatory, olfactory, tactile and kinesthetic telepathic transmission. Using a partner of the opposite sex, assume a relaxed position facing each other. The sender focuses on an emotional feeling and holds onto that as a carrier wave. Experiment with positive and negative emotions and note the differences. Now visualize and transmit a certain taste -- sweetness of chocolate candy, sourness of a lemon, bitterness of strong, black coffee or the salty, crispiness of potato chips. Next, transmit a certain smell -- an odor of a septic tank, a fragrance of a certain flower, tobacco or herb. Next, transmit a particular tactile sensation -- being naked on an iceberg, handling a snake or a ball with sharp pins, being sat on by an elephant or petting a shaggy dog. And finally, transmit a kinesthetic feeling -- falling off a high building, being buried alive in a coffin, rowing a boat, doing a somersault or simply making love. Next have your partner go into another room or simply turn around so your back is towards your partner's. Now let your partner taste each of 4 glasses of water with salt, sugar, lemon juice and instant coffee individually prepared.

Subconsciously though, these telepathic energies ARE received by recipients on a subtle level, as evidenced by measurable blood volume changes in their hands. Experiments reveal that these same physiological changes (registered on instrumentation) occur regardless of the distance between the sender and the receiver. When two or more people concentrate in unison, the effect is magnified geo- metrically (not 1 + 1 ..., but 1 x 10 ...). Mob psychology or group hysteria is a good illustration in panic situations what can be easily \"felt\" by all who are present. People at a sporting event, rock concert or public demonstration easily get caught up in the \"electricity\" or \"atmosphere\" of the gathering. One Soviet experiment involved group telepathy in a boxing match. Five trained telepaths beamed losing thoughts to the champion while another five telepaths beamed winning thoughts to the underdog. The underdog won easily.

Your emotional intention is what animals pick up, and they can pick it up even stronger when you look at them. When you are sad or depressed, many pets will try to console you in your time of emotional need. Conversely, you intuitively know when your pet is unhappy or sad as well. In animals, emotions are clearer and more basic than human thought processes. Honesty is natural with animals, so non-verbal communication between them is easy. Dishonesty is a man-made trait and comes with muddled thinking and fractional brain use. Animals use 100% of their brain and have no need of deception. Nevertheless, the brain wave output of all animals lies in the same general ELF (extremely low frequency) range as in humans. Perhaps this is why they can often home in on their masters from great distances. There are numerous accounts of lost or deserted pets traveling across the country to reunite with their owners. In one experiment, researchers had volunteers bring their dogs to a laboratory. When the dogs' owners were \"attacked\" in a different room with surprise ice cubes down the neck, instruments recorded distinct physiological changes in the dogs. As an exercise in communicating with your pet dog or cat, start with something that is familiar to it. First, preface your telepathy with a lot of love and affection physically. Emotions are already a universal language, and positive feelings lay the telepathic groundwork for a better rapport. Now clear your mind of all inner thoughts and issue mentally the visualization of your pet's food in his bowl or the sounds of opening the can or any accompanying sensory data associated with the feeding process. Imagine your pet eating the food while you emanate love and affection toward him. At first, you might enhance the effect by looking into your pet's eyes, for there is a communicative energy transmitted by your eyes (see \"Exercise -- Eye Contact For Inner Communication\"). Later, even distant telepathic messages will provide little problem as long as you remember to transmit with emotion and feeling. Visualize commands of \"come,\" \"sit\" or \"lie down\" while seeing the animal doing the desired action. Pulse your command with rhythm like in \"Exercise -- Audio Telepathy.\" Transmit simultaneously with 2 or more people and study the effect. Don't forget to learn what your animal is projecting to you as well. Clear your mind and let it run idle while you look at your pet. Impressions will begin to form.

After crushing one plant in the presence of other philodendrons, sharp reactions were noted in the \"onlooking\" plants. Afterwards, even mere thoughts of crushing the remaining plants brought about the same recordable responses in the plants. After these and similar experiments were made known, a rash of people began talking to their plants in various parts of the world. People started to realize that their emotional thoughts could actually affect their plants' growing condition. (\"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever. And presently the fig tree withered away.\" Matt. 21:19) As an exercise in affecting plants with your mind, plant an identical number of vegetable seeds in 3 different pots. Label one positive, one negative and one neutral. For 5 or 10 minutes each day, bestow loving, encouraging thoughts or blessings and prayer over the positive pot. Visualize strong and healthy growth in the plants. Then communicate emotional thoughts of hate, anger, frustration and discouragement to the negative pot, and ignore the neutral pot entirely. After a few weeks, compare the growth in the pots to see if your emotional thoughts have any observable influence. As an additional exercise, label 3 large jars of water -- positive, negative and neutral. Transmit the same visualizations and subjective thought processes to the water as you previously did to the seeds and growing plants. Do this for 5 or 10 minutes each day for 2 weeks. Then after labeling 3 more pots of vegetable seeds in the same way as the previous exercise, use only this water to see which one sprouts first and grows more vigorously. Now place a moist seed in the palm of your hand and ask it to grow rapidly. Fully associate yourself in this process, and emotionally \"feel\" it filling up with energy in readiness to sprout. Do this while issuing a single musical note, whistle or chant (AUM, OOM, YAM, RAM, etc.). Plant it and record its sprouting time vs a control planting. Research has revealed that single pure tones issued as above seem to contribute to faster seed sprouting. Follow the same procedure with your other hand, and compare any differences in your results.

Now let him dry his hands as well as the stone. Ask him to hold the stone in his left hand and think strongly about one thing for about a minute.

If you keep an open mind to everything in the world, you can learn. When you close your mind to anything, how can you learn? You've learned in other exercises how your thoughts alone can affect your bodily functions as well as those around you, but thoughts also have tangible effects on inanimate materials as well. All things in the universe are connected in some way. Think back to a time when your car developed 'troubles' or when your home appliances started going on the 'fritz.' Were you cursing your car or home? Were you going through a bout of depression, loneliness, anger or stress? Your thought energy has a ripple effect on the universe, and it is most magnified in your immediate surroundings. Negative thoughts produce a scattered, disorderly effect. Developing a psychokinetic ability is similar to other things in your life. You must have a desire to achieve it. You must believe it is possible for you to have it and you must expect to get it. After watching Uri Geller bend spoons and other metal objects on British TV, hundreds of onlookers wound up performing the same feats in their own homes! For this exercise, assume a comfortable, relaxed position in a chair (review \"Exercises -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\" and \"Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes\"). Now slowly take several deep, abdominal breaths by inhaling to the count of 4, holding it to the count of 4, exhaling to the count of 4 and pausing to the count of 4. Take a spoon and hold it in one hand by grasping it in the crotch with your fingers. Hold it loosely, and with your thumb, gently stroke the middle part of the spoon. As you're stroking the spoon with your thumb, repeat to yourself inwardly the word -- BEND. You can pulse your commands in a rhythmic manner or in whatever way feels comfortable to you. While stroking the spoon and repeating the word bend , visualize the spoon in an already bent position or as limp as a wet noodle. Imagine a ball of white energy above the top of your head; then feel it vibrate and move down through your head and into your arms; and then through your fingertips into the spoon. Imagine a spiral or vortex of energy streaming from your eyes and into the spoon. When doing this technique, direct your total conscious awareness to the process. Being preoccupied by everyday emotional conflicts can prevent results. Blank your"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  329 mind of any internal comments, evaluations or distractions. The more focalized your concentration, the faster the spoon will bend. Many times the spoon will bend at the thinnest part (although no significant temperature increase is noted), and sometimes it will simply soften to the point that a slight push with the thumb produces the bend. In the beginning, it might take you a while to achieve the task, but sometimes it happens rather quickly. After the first time though, subsequent bendings will take far less time, because your belief system will be stronger. About 10% to 20% of the people will succeed in spoon bending the first time out. A high percentage of children succeed in this because their belief system is less cluttered with doubts. The ages 7 to 11 are especially successful. Approach this exercise with a sense of fun and excitement. Don't use the word try. You either bend the spoon or you don't bend the spoon. If you don't at first, then do it the next time. Sometimes the spoon will begin bending on its own after you put it down. Sometimes it becomes unnaturally soft and can be twisted into abnormal shapes (perhaps there's a molecular or vibrational metal fatigue going on). Some people can bend spoons easily when alone, but not in the presence of doubters or TV cameras. Negative vibrations seem to affect the sensitivity of their results. One researcher enhanced his psychokinetic abilities with a pyramid fitted on his head. A fter the Soviet Nina Kulagina demonstrated how she moved objects psycho- kinetically, she reportedly lost several pounds and felt fatigued. A lot of energy was obviously expended during the process. Brain instruments reflect tremendous activity in the visual or rear area of Kulagina's cerebrum during psychokinetic sessions, and her heartbeat increases to 240 beats per minute. Findings are similar with others, and some people even suffer temporary blindness (rear area of the brain governs vision). Sometimes rubbing your hands together or on the tabletop is an element in getting started with an electrostatic charge, but being grounded also helps results!? Initially learning how to move objects psychokinetically involves a great deal of nervous, emotional energy, and instruments record electrostatic pulsations in the direction of the affected objects. Afterwards, your interest and belief structure is strengthened, and a relaxed thought energy mysteriously achieves the same thing without electrostatic assistance. Since positive emotions focus the energy flow, hold the objects beforehand and create enjoyable feelings about them. Doubt and not being able to trust yourself diffuses your energy and holds you back, so practice positively and you'll succeed. Since there is an energy that streams forth from your eyes (see \"Exercise --"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"330  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Psionic and Psychotronic Generators\"), moving objects that are already accumulators of pranic energy like paper cones is easy. Now you can move on to ping pong balls placed on a flat, level surface. Relax and fixate your gaze on the ball and create for yourself the intention for it to move. See it moving in your mind's eye. Give your undivided attention to it for 2 or 3 minutes, then stop and practice again later. Be patient with yourself and practice during various emotional moods (anger, joy, compassion, love, etc.) or while projecting different visualizations (a laser beam, a hammer, a puff of air or even a tone of the right frequency). With persistent practice, you'll eventually strike the right combination. Instead of moving ping pong balls, many people find great success in moving or dissipating clouds in the sky.

Although other levitating incidents have occurred with yogis and lamas in the East, the West has not been devoid of such occurrences. St. Francis of Assisi (1224), St. Teresa of Avila (1565), Francisco Suarez (1548-1617), Maria Corones of Agreda (1602-1665), and St. Joseph of Cupertino (1603-1663) all were Catholic religious figures that reportedly levitated. In fact, St. Joseph of Cupertino levitated so frequently that it became part of his normal behavior. Giuseppe Desa (St. Joseph) became a priest in 1628 and not only amazed fellow priests and nuns with his levitations, but was also witnessed by Pope Urban VIII and John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick. In one instance, the \"flying friar\" watched 10 workmen having difficulty erecting a heavy iron cross on a church near his hometown. It was reported that \"he rose like a bird into the air,\" easily lifting the cross and setting it in place on top of the building! (\"... He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do ...\" John 14:12) The \"spiritual medium\" Daniel Dunglas Home was observed levitating numerous times. In 1852, the Hartford Times stated that he began at the age of 19 with a spontaneous levitation to his ceiling. Later, after learning to control his levitations, he demonstrated his ability to such notables as Emperor Napoleon III and Mark Twain. More recently, the transcendental meditators of Maharishi Maharesh have been offered a special mantra and instructions that reportedly enable them to levitate. At the Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa, 2 meditation domes have been constructed for meditators to safely and privately levitate inside them. As there seems to be a great deal of hopping in the initial stages, crash pads are often attached to their legs to cushion their sudden descents. In all instances of levitation, an altered state of awareness seems definitely involved. In a self-hypnotized state, the psychic Edgar Cayce once levitated to his stenographer's hand when she threw it out and said \"hold up there.\" Afterwards she was startled and withdrew her hand, whereupon he descended. Her only intention was for him to slow down his rate of speech so she could transcribe his words easier. Russian cosmonauts have also reportedly levitated after being hypnotized into believing that they were weightless. All in all, levitation reports are just too numerous to discount. Lulu Hurst, a 14-year old girl, gave demonstrations of her amazing power on stage in the U.S. from 1883 - 1885. If a muscular man held a cane in front of his"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"332  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION chest, Lulu could lightly place her hand against it and gyrate both the cane and man so violently that eventually both flew suddenly backward. In one instance, 3 men sat one on top of the other in a kitchen chair. Lulu placed her palms against the back of the chair and raised chair and men 6 inches off the floor for 2 minutes. There were obviously more than the normal energies at work here. For a simple exercise in partial levitation, organize 5 participants. Have the heav- iest subject sit on a hassock or chair. Let the other 4 people stand around him. Now in synchronous rotation have one person put his right hand on top of the seated person's head; then the next person does the same; then the next and finally the last. Now do the same with the left hand until all 8 hands have formed a tower on the seated person’s head and no 2 hands belonging to the same person are in contact. Practice these movements until you can stack the hands smoothly and rhythmically in a flowing manner. The next stage is practicing in a rotational manner putting the forefinger of each standing person under the knees and armpits of the seated person. After a slight momentary pressure downward to the count of 6 of all 8 hands, they are removed and holding a full breath of air, the first person puts his forefinger under the right knee, second person under the right armpit, third person under the left armpit and the fourth person under the left knee. Get the rhythm down smoothly moving from the stacked position to the knee and armpit position. Then have someone acting as a guide say, \"Lift!\" and you will find how easily and often surprisingly the 4 people can lift the seated person up in a synchronous fashion. The success of this exercise lies in the smoothness of the rhythm and the simultaneous lifting process of the participants. Rehearse it a few times before attempting to do the lift, so your tempo is achieved. It might take 3 or 4 times to get everybody in 'synch,' but you'll do it. Sometimes dispensing with the hand stacking can be substituted with the affirming of a phrase several times in unison like \"Chocolate ice cream\" or \"Pumpkin pie\" or \"Lifting is easy.\" The content of the phrase does not seem to matter, but the rhythm does. Does the group thought process of a levitating intention reverse some inner polarity of the person to be levitated? Does the repetition of a phrase over and over bring about a slightly altered state of awareness so that your intention to levitate is carried out? It appears that the energy of thought projection can affect gravity in some way. When you feel excited about a project and your energy field expands, the gravitational pull is distributed over a much greater area (see \"Exercise -- Electromagnetic Field Awareness\"), and you 'feel' as though you're floating along the ground. When you"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  333 consciously direct your energy field in a contracted 'heavy' manner, the opposite effect is the result (see \"Exercise -- Making Yourself Too Heavy To Be Moved\"). Since the weight on a physical scale does not change in these instances, a partial reversal of polarity in your body's energy field creates the unusual effect. During levitation, perhaps the combination of proper breathing and visualization rotates your body's resonance?! Now sit or lie down in a comfortable, relaxed position and take several, deep, abdominal breaths. Progressively relax all the muscles of your body from your toes to your head. With your eyes closed, roll your eyeballs upwards and say, \"Relax\" to yourself. Feel your whole body in a relaxed state and clear your mind (review \"Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness\" and \"Exercise -- Learning Self- Hypnosis\"). Now using a mental kinesthetic rhythm, visualize your body pulsing with energy upwards in a slow lifting motion as you inwardly say, \"Lift\" ... \"Lift,\" and feel your body acquiring a sense of lightness. Let your mind harmonize its brain wave level with the resonant frequency of the earth at 7.82 cycles per second. The synchrony of the mental affirmation, \"Lift,\" with the pulsing visualization upwards takes practice, but eventually your mind/body thought process will tangibly manifest itself in a physical way and levitation will be achieved. Once achieved, it will not be difficult to repeat."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"334  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Exercise 197 -- Thinking As A Group When the ancient Jews were bargaining with someone, they always stood or sat with their feet together and their hands clasped to effectively conserve the vital energy of their body. When the Jew bargained in this way and his opponent did not, the Jew had the advantage. Select a small group of unselfish, clear thinking people to accompany you for the following exercise. Let everyone sit in a circle with their feet together and their hands clasped. Each participant should be a separate physical unit, not touching one another. Positive, constructive thoughts have far more power than primitive, destructive thoughts. Choose an unselfish thought for the benefit of mankind that you all agree upon. Now sit in relaxed silence and think of that unselfish thought, while all of you gaze into the center of the circle at the space on the floor. You can use a candle as a focal point if you like, but it is not necessary for the effect. After several minutes, each of you will gradually feel a calm and peace permeate your very essence. You will feel as if you're being flooded with inner light and the spiritual feeling of being one with the universe will be more readily understood. Do this for at least 15 to 30 minutes. All pure thoughts that you generate in this way not only contribute to the welfare of the people around you, but to your own benefit as well. Even practicing by yourself in this way is highly beneficial. (\"Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them ....\" Matt. 18:19) So one person plus another person agreeing on the same thing is not 1 + 1 in amplitude, but like 10 x 1 in its effect. Since the group effect geometrically increases the amplitude of any focused attention, it can also be used in telepathy, psychokinesis and sending healing energy to someone at a distance. M ultiply a negative vibration by thousands or millions of people and discordant 'auras' over cities, countries or even worlds can be perceived as they are approached from a distance. Focused, directed, positive energy from one or more people can change events and conditions because orderliness is more universally natural than disorderliness. Your energies are more in harmony with the universe when they are positive and focused. When you feel the universe as friendly, abundant and filled with joy and selfless love, you attract exactly that reality. As an example, in areas where large groups of peaceful meditators congregate, crime and traffic accidents drop significantly. Whether you engage in negativity or positivity, as ye sow, so shall ye reap."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  335 Exercise 198 -- Understanding Any Spoken Language A phenomenon know as glossolalia takes place when you suddenly speak an unknown language or dialect that formerly you had no knowledge of. In charismatic Christian circles this is called \"speaking in tongues.\" In other religions, it is called other things, but in all cases an altered state of awareness is seemingly achieved prior to the phenomenon. The operations of the conscious, willful side of the brain are suspended. As far back as Vergil (70 - 19 B.C.), there have been references to the tongues speaking with the Sibylline priestess on the Isle of Delos. Speaking in tongues is found among Mohammedans, Eskimos of Greenland and many African tribes. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, taught his followers to speak in tongues by telling them to \"Arise upon your feet, speak or make some sound, continue to make sounds of some kind, and the Lord will make a tongue or language of it.\" Coupled with glossolalia is the occasional phenomenon of xenoglossia or spontan- eous interpretation of the unknown tongue by certain witnessing individuals present. (\"If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; ...\" 1 Corin. 14:27, 28) Many people have experienced this same phenomenon to a lesser degree when they visit a foreign country and they listen to an unknown language. Suddenly they seem to understand what was said at times, but they don't know how they understand it. Is there an intuitive part of the brain that can act as a universal translator without the cognitive process of knowing how to speak the language itself? Xenoglossia has also been reported among Muslims in India where certain individuals have recited portions of the Koran in its original language, Arabic, without having previously understood Arabic. The ability to understand any language or dialect can be practiced with the follow- ing exercise: Assume a comfortable, relaxed seated position and take several deep, abdominal breaths. This can be done in a group situation or by yourself, so arrange all chairs to face an appropriate TV screen. A prearranged video cassette should have one minute blurbs spoken in various foreign languages by different individuals on subjects with emotional impact. (Emotions are already a universal language that cut across all mental barriers.) Look at the TV narrator's face and listen to the sound of what he is saying and the way he is saying it without trying to analytically interpret it. After his monologue, take one minute to write down what you intuitively thought he said or meant. While"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"336  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION doing this, have the video go into a one minute musical mode with soothing largo movements of baroque composers (see \"Exercise -- Rhythmic Memorizing\"). Then have the same person on the video give the English translation of what he said in the foreign tongue. Move onto the next one minute monologue in a foreign tongue with a different language and narrator. Go into the musical mode and write down what you think was said. Then have the English translation given on video by the same person. Continue with these one minute foreign language blurbs, one minute write downs and follow-up interpretations over and over for one half hour per day -- always varying the foreign language or dialect and differing the content of the monologue. Since the analytical side of the brain cannot interpret any of the content at all, the non-analytical side of the brain has to make the adjustment. By applying a relaxed \"letting go\" process (achieving an alpha/theta state is ideal), the subconscious will tune into the language and you'll be understanding it without understanding how you understand it. It's like thinking with intention instead of words. Researchers have found in people that have had their corpus callosum severed that their right brain has recognition abilities of language but simply cannot verbalize it. It might take many sessions and a lot practice, but this spontaneous interpretive listening can be mastered in time. Also, the feedback of the English translation after each monologue allows you to monitor your progress. As a variation to the above and for the more visual minded, have the one minute foreign language monologues piped through a tape player's headset while you look at the foreign language written on a sheet of paper in front of you. After a one minute pause where you write down a translation of what you thought was said, the interpretation of the passage is then given in the next interval. Select passages that have emotional impact for better interpretation. Many colleges have not only foreign magazines and newspapers that would suit this purpose, but also appropriate interpreters as well. Just as a child understands a mother's language before actually speaking it, future humans may also learn to understand each other's dialect. Perhaps this was always ancient man's inherent ability, and that which was referred to in the biblical story of Babel. Maybe when God smote the people, he didn't afflict them with different dialects. He simply took away their ability to understand each other's dialect. (Genesis 11:7 ..... \"and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\") After mastering this exercise and \"Exercise -- Speed Reading At Over 2,000 wpm,\" you will quickly learn how to speed read any foreign language"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  337 text with complete comprehension as well. You may also be able to apprehend and discern the meaning of ancient tablets of unknown hieroglyphs with equal ease. The portion of the human mind that allows this process to take place may also be linked to the same faculty that allows telepathy to take place?! As you learned in the telepathy exercises, when you read another person's mind who thinks in a foreign language, you are really reading the thought intention of a transmitter's words, not the words themselves. If you have mastered lucid dreaming (review \"Exercise -- Lucid Dreaming: Conscious Awareness of Your Dreams\"), you may also be surprised to learn how understanding other languages in the dream world is quite easy when language tapes are played during the sleep-learning process (review \"Exercise -- Sleep-Learning\")."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"338  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Exercise 199 -- Speed Reading At Over 2000 WPM The eye's fovea is a small spot near the retina's center filled with a high concentration of photoreceptors that allows the focal point of your vision to send visual information to the conscious thinking part of your brain. The fovea receives only a small part of the light entering the eye, and when reading, usually no more than 7 letters are acknowledged at a time. The number of jumps your eye makes with the focal point of your vision limits you to normal reading speeds. The parafovea is an area that surrounds the fovea and can take in much more information with your peripheral vision. The parafovea is connected to other areas of your brain that govern instinct and reflex. The light that hits the parafovea is subliminal information (beyond the conscious threshold). When tachistoscopic blips are flashed at 1/100th of a second throughout a movie, they are subliminal and not consciously noticeable until you are told that they are there. Then your conscious awareness can easily see the quick flashes. Training your subconscious awareness to acknowledge this peripheral visual input for interpretation by your conscious awareness is the process of speed reading. Also remember that your mind will have the tendency to want to complete things that appear uncompleted (see \"Exercise -- Completion\"). So as the words flow past your eyes, your mind will develop the ability to complete the text as thought forms. Int ernal verbalization ceases at speeds over 1000 wpm. As a result, auditory learners often have the most trouble quieting their mind. Evelyn Wood showed that adapting your brain to higher speeds was a learned process like any other new talent. She also demonstrated that comprehension and retention of speed read material was considerably higher. To increase your reading skills, you must open your thinking about it. Attitude is everything. You must “want to” read fast and affirm and believe you “CAN” read fast, and “know” comprehension will be better. Adopting an attitude of \"wanting to\" read and recall information at faster speeds is important. The training procedure involves moving down the page and seeing all the print with a sense that goes beyond normal reading methods. The hand is used as a pacer to curb regressions, to enhance perceptual ability, to control the rate of speed and to direct concentration. You do not make the eyes follow each motion of the hand slavishly, but instead you \"let go\" and allow the eyes to move where they will. By looking for total concepts you become aware of details with more thoroughness. It's like shifting your conscious awareness to the right brain to do the job instead of to the internally verbalizing left brain. You learn to allow all the words to come in rapidly"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  339 and effortlessly without stopping and considering each word individually. You learn to read thought by thought instead of word by word. As you read down the page, you become more aware of the feeling, atmosphere and mood of the story as well as the thinking of the author, and thereby you receive more vivid and lasting impressions. Learn to form visualizations as you read involving any of your senses that you feel comfortable with. Periodically ask yourself, \"What is going on?\" and \"What is being told here?\" When you start to speed read, images will begin to flow past your inner eye in a rapid, understandable and natural way (see \"Exercise -- Time Distortion\"). When this happens, integrate other sensory imagery of tastes, sounds, smells and kinesthetics for better retention. As an exercise in speed reading, first look over the material in its entirety by turning all the pages and skimming for the general gist of the material. Look at the table of contents; note subdivisions; and review summary paragraphs. Determine where the book intends to take you. This preliminary increases the assimilation process. Also, make sure that you're in a relaxed, comfortable position with good posture (review “Exercise -- Relaxation For Improved Awareness”). It’s important to be in a proper state of readiness before actually beginning. In actual practice, if you used a lazy \"S\" hand movement or made a series of overlapping circles down the printed page at varying high speeds for one half hour per day with no thought of comprehending and paying attention to only the white areas of the page, in six weeks your brain would be com prehending the words, and you would be reading at thousands of words per minute! Just make sure your conscious awareness (review \"Exercise -- Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness\") is directed to following your hand movement down the page and not directed to idle internal visualizations. Use a definite sweeping rhythm, and consciously watch the words flow in front of your eyes. Catch yourself every time your attention wanders and direct your conscious attentiveness back to the pages. If you're having trouble with this, you might reiterate aloud the phrase, \"I am reading shockingly fast\" to disengage your left brain from the reading process while running your finger down the pages. As you progress, you might also cock your head to the right and look at the printed material slightly in the left field of vision while reading. This projects the material directly to your right brain, which is the side with the high speed reading skill. You can also experiment and position the book above eye level by cocking your head downward and tilt the eyes upwards for the reading process.

T his exercise might seem to proceed in a totally opposite manner than you have been previously taught in normal reading, but you must suspend your skepticism and judgment, and simply believe it is possible for you to read thousands of words per minute."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  341 Exercise 200 -- High Speed Listening Are you \"hard of listening\" instead of \"hard of hearing?\" Do you really listen to people or are you always thinking about what YOU are ready to say when someone is talking to you? This exercise in speed listening will focus your listening abilities. How fast does your mind assimilate verbal information? Translators at the United Nations reiterate translations as the original language is spoken. Other people have the faculty of being able to repeat any spoken words a split second after other people have said them, and sometimes even backwards! Newscasters learn to read their news material fast, steadily and without frequent errors. As an exercise in listening intently, play a cassette tape with a lecture dialogue on it. As you listen to it, repeat what you hear word for word into a cassette recorder. Then afterwards, compare both recordings for accuracy. If you read at a rate of only 200 - 300 words per minute, your attention will no doubt wander from time to time. This absent-mindedness often requires regression over the same material again and again. The same phenomenon sometimes occurs when listening to a monotone lecturer that is speaking at a rate of 125 - 150 words per minute. Your attention wanders and little is absorbed. By listening to a process of compressed or speeded-up tapes, a delivery rate of 350 words per minute can be easily assimilated by your brain. Dr. Sally R. McCracken at Detroit's Wayne State University uses a technique of editing tapes to remove portions of recorded material. By taking out pauses between words and by shortening the time needed to make vowel sounds, Dr. McCracken uses a special machine that scans an audio tape and cuts out these short segments of \"needless sound.\" Originally used by blind listeners, it was found that besides reducing listening time, the system also aids comprehension by forcing listeners to concentrate more intently. In the early 1970's, Sandy Greenberg, an engineering student at Columbia University, discovered that he was going blind. Desiring to learn as much information in the shortest possible time, Greenberg approached a friend, Murray Schiffman, who set to work on a technique for varying the playback speed of recorded tapes without affecting the pitch. Tape hobbyists knew, for example, that when you played back a tape at twice the speed at which it was recorded, it was difficult or impossible to understand. For one thing, the speaker's voice was automatically raised a full octave, out of the range of normal speech intelligibility. The technique had been used for comic effect in earlier days with the series of novelty"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"342  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION song hits featuring Alvin and the Chipmunks. So what Schiffman eventually came up with was a circuit that would play back recorded material at variable speeds without altering the pitch, and with up to 100% increase or decrease without losing intelligibility. The technique is now called variable speech control or VSC. Corporations began using speed listening cassette players to save valuable training time and money. It was found that most of the students using VSC liked listening at faster than normal rates. Tests showed that speeds from about 1.75 to 2.0 times normal (about 275 - 300 wpm) improved comprehension and retention. In looking for ways to speed up the training process, speech compression seemed to be the best idea, because 90% of the course work was self-instructional. D epending upon the quality of the tape recording device, information can be progressively speeded up to 10 or 20 times normal speed and still be intelligibly assimilated. For this exercise, you need to create just such a tape first. Assume a self-hypnotic state and use the time distortion technique with a metronome (review \"Exercise -- Learning Self-Hypnosis\" and \"Exercise -- Learn Through Time Distortion\"). Indicate when you have achieved a time distorted perception by saying to an assistant, \"I'm ready.\" At this point, the information tape is played to you through a head set at the high speed rate. You'll find that with practice, greater quantities of information can be absorbed in this way in a shorter span of time."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  343 Exercise 201 -- Talking Fast When you're emotionally angered, your continuity and logical flow of thoughts in speaking is greatly lessened. Also because people live according to patterns or rhythms during a normal work week, language usually follows this rhythmic pace. Consequently, high-pressured people speak quicker, because their language rhythm is an expression of their life's rhythm. The ability to talk fast varies with each person, but it is directly related to your ability to think fast. Your normal speaking rate also coincides with your normal reading rate aloud. The record for fast reading aloud was set in 1988 by Ms. Fran Capo with 682 wpm. That's faster than most people read silently!

Prophecy or precognition more specifically identifies future seeing clairvoyance. By relaxing your conscious waking mind, your subconscious mind can establish a link to the universal storehouse of information. Obtain a crystal (even a diamond is good) that shines. If you choose a quartz crystal, make sure you are attuned with it (see \"Exercise -- Using Quartz Crystals\"). Relax in a comfortable position and reduce the lighting very low (natural candlelight is good.). Make the room so dark that the crystal becomes hazy in your hand. Now look at the crystal without trying to see anything, as if you were looking into the far distance. Relax your eyes and let your focus go out of 'synch.' The crystal will only be inches from you, but it will seem like miles. The crystal will eventually begin to cloud and suddenly the milkiness will roll away and disclose the world in some way. Remain steady and don't jerk or you'll lose the picture and have to start all over again another night. Using a quartz crystal, the fuzzy wisps of hair and clouds inside it begin to transform themselves into people, animals, landscapes, and cities of wonder. With clairvoyance, you can view the world's history and often find things quite different than in the history books. You might even see snatches of the future, but remember have faith in yourself and the process, and you will succeed. Everyone has precognitive 'feelings' from time to time. One survey of 28 documented train wrecks revealed that significantly fewer people rode the trains that crashed than rode them on the same day of the week in earlier weeks or months. Also, most major disasters are often preceded by precognitive impressions by many people around the world. In some cases, a degree of clairvoyance has developed as a result of an abnormal growth on the thyroid. When the growth is removed by surgery, the clairvoyant sensitivity disappears. Could a heightened sensitivity be artificially produced by clever surgery?

In \"Exercise -- Psychometry,\" you learned that many vibrations are picked up by inanimate objects. Crystals not only pick up and store vibrations, but they focus, direct, shield, transform, balance and amplify your own vibrational energy as well. Choose your quartz crystal by the way it 'feels' to you. If a chipped and ugly one feels right, then that's the crystal for you. To start off, use a clear, single-terminated quartz crystal (it has only one point). Since your crystal picks up vibrations easily, it is necessary to initially cleanse it. You can pack your crystal in salt (preferably sea salt) or soak it in salt water for 7 days (1 tsp. sea salt to 1 qt. of pure water). You can put the crystal in running water (like a stream) or bury it in the earth for 7 days. The vibrations of painful emotions and health problems can be imparted to your crystal, so short cleansings are periodically necessary. For short cleansings, a 3-day period of any of the above procedures is sufficient. If your crystal is handled by someone, clear it with a salt solution soaking for 10-30 minutes. After cleansing, place your crystal in the direct dawn sunlight for 2 to 3 hours to charge and activate it with the life energy of the sun. If your crystal is small enough, carry it with you wherever you go. Instead of being your 'pet rock,' this can be your 'pet crystal,' but don't let others handle and imprint on it their thought vibrations. You can sleep with it, meditate with it, talk to it or say your prayers with it. The more it is exposed to you, the more attuned to your vibration it becomes. It quickly becomes your friend and your teacher. To some degree, it will even protect you from the negative effects of artificial environments and shield you from negative forces. Since 50 - 75% of all of your scattered thought impressions during the day are derived from ELF (extremely low frequency) waves generated from other entities, a crystal properly tuned to your vibration will help keep your mind clearer of this 'mental noise.' Some people have had their crystal crack when a negative hit was sent in their direction. It can also mirror back negativity in this respect. In one experiment, a researcher discovered that a handful of small, double- terminated quartz \"diamonds\" from either Lake County, CA or Herkimer County, NY has the potential of splitting shot glasses in half when the crystals are placed inside them and allowed to sit for a few hours or days. The peculiar configuration of a heavy bottomed shot glass appears to be the only type of glass where this cracking"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"348  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION phenomenon works. It is undetermined what kind of energy accumulates and is imparted to the glass to make it split into 2 pieces? Just as quartz computer chips store information, your quartz crystal can store and focus your intentional or emotional energy. Crystals augment and magnify your intention, so you should only use them when in a clear, positive state of mind. As an exercise with your crystal, do \"Exercise -- Imagine and Mind Walk Your Goals\" and \"Exercise -- Imaging To Bring Luck And Happiness\" while visualizing the results you want to achieve flowing through your crystal. You'll find that your visualizations become more powerful and effective when using your crystal, especially those concerning healing (review \"Exercise -- Improving Your Visualization Skills\"). If you send healing prayers through your crystal while holding it over an afflicted area, they will be greatly magnified. Since crystals amplify emotional intentions with more distinctness, do the telepathy exercises while holding your crystal. Your ELF thought waves can be augmented and sent through your crystal and then received through someone else's crystal and decoded with their thoughts (like the crystal in a radio set assists in transmitting sound across space). For example, danger can be transmitted quite easily. Use your crystal for storage of reminders or information that you may want to retrieve later, or for that matter that you want to have someone else to retrieve, but make sure that you connect up such information with some emotional intention for better clarity. If you go to sleep holding or putting your crystal under your pillow, solutions to problems on your mind will greet you when you awaken. Double-terminated crystals are especially good for dream solutions, because the energy comes and goes in both directions to connect your conscious with your subconscious. If you do your concentration and meditation exercises with your crystal, the result will be greatly enhanced. If you hold your crystal between clasped hands over your solar plexus, you can feel the energy drawing into your body.

Farmers have been using the technique of divining for centuries to locate water for well use. There are all kinds of diviner's rods and dowser's pendulums on the market. They all act as wave guides to attune your vibration of intention to what you're seeking to find. For a simple exercise in divining for water, cut 2 wire coat hangers with snips so that you can make two L-shaped pieces about 15 inches by 6 inches. Now loosely hold the small end of each piece, one in each hand. Place a pail of water in front of you and think about water, but don't close your eyes. Extend your loosely held rods over the water, and watch them cross each other in an X over the water. (If you have Rh negative blood, they will generally angle out to each side, instead of crossing.) Do it away from the water and nothing happens (unless you're over other water). Make sure that your legs are kept apart to about the same distance as your arms so that an optimal flow of polarized currents can be picked up from the earth. Consider yourself to be the instrument, not the divining rod. The rod is only the indicator, like the pendulum. Use the same technique to look for coins or metal objects. Have someone hide different coins under a rug. Then individually think of each coin, and name each one as your rods cross over its hidden position. Russian researchers revealed less accuracy achieved when a current-carrying wire was wound around the wrists of subject dowsers or a magnet was brought close to their heads. So apparently electricity and magnetism can interfere with reception. W hen you use a dowser's pendulum or a diviner's rod while you're blindfolded, no results are usually achieved. Visual perception is important in relaying the infor- mation to your inner awareness, because your eyes act as a receiving channel (review \"Exercise -- Eye Contact For Inner Communication\"). You can locate coins under a rug in the same way as you did with the diviner's rod. Dangle your pendulum over the rug and think of the coin desired as you walk. The pendulum will swing back and forth until it reaches the coin location, then it will begin to circle."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"350  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION Now take your pendulum and suspend it over the central locus of a semicircle of 5 colors (red, green, blue, yellow and orange) like in Figure A. Sit with your back to a partner that has 5 sheets of colored construction paper (red, green, blue, orange and yellow). Let your partner hold up one of the colored sheets so that his line of sight is just over the sheet, and he is looking at your pendulum or the back of your head. Your pendulum should begin moving in the direction of the appropriate color. Experiment with all the colors. Now have your partner just think of one of the colors while looking at you or your pendulum. On a subliminal level, your subconscious will pick up the ELF (extremely low frequency) thought projections that are being amplified by your partner's eyes and the information will be transmitted to your instrument.  Figure A   red green blue  yellow orange Maps are like pictures -- symbolic form representations that carry the vibrations of what they portray. To do map or picture dowsing, visualize what you want to find & dangle your pendulum over the areas represented. You can detect water, minerals or lost objects by attuning your vibration of intention to 'home' in on the vibration of that which is sought. Your pendulum will circle when it locates what you want. Practice will make you better, but don't forget that with some people it takes a 20 - 30 second attunement adjustment before achieving results."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  351 Exercise 205 -- Prenatal Learning For many years now, prenatal learning has been used by the Japanese. Re- searchers have found that fetuses begin reacting to sound stimuli at about 26 weeks. As a fetus in the womb, there is no way that a child can become distracted. Therefore an external stimulus is met by a captive audience. Since brain growth is continual throughout fetal development, some of the senses are quite active. For instance, it has been found that fetuses turn towards pleasant music and comfortable sounds, but away from discordant noise like rock music. In fact, noise pollution drastically impairs fetal brain development. Studies of prenatal development by University of North Carolina psychologist Anthony DeCasper have shown that newborn babies can detect the difference between their mothers' voices and those of other women, and that they prefer female voices to male voices. There was also evidence to indicate that newborn babies showed a preference for Dr. Seuss stories read to them before birth over new Dr. Seuss stories only read to them after birth. In another study, a researcher chose 20 random Greek words for pregnant mothers to read to their unborn infants. After birth, these same 20 Greek words proved easier to learn later in childhood over 20 other randomly chosen Greek words. In Hayw ard, California, Dr. Rene van de Carr has a prenatal university that teaches parents to get to know their infants before birth. Beginning with the fifth month, a basic method or word association is progressively established through a series of games. The \"kick game\" involves saying, \"Kick mommy,\" to the fetus when kicking is initiated. Later the spoken words - pat, rub, squeeze, tap, shake and stroke are associated with the appropriate tactile stimulus on the mother's tummy. The on and off switching of a flashlight on the lower part of the mother's abdomen is done while stating the words \"light\" and \"dark.\" Perhaps the best example of prenatal learning has been with the development of the 4 Susedik girls (Susan, Stacey, Stephanie & Johanna). Their parents, Joe and Jitsuko Susedik, routinely talked to each of their fetal babies, read the alphabet, practiced phonics and discussed social studies as if they were really present in the flesh. As a result, they gave their children a head start before birth, and all four developed into actual geniuses later. As an exercise for your prenatal baby, you can begin by reading simple academics at your 5th month of pregnancy. Use deep, inner imagery about what you read aloud, because your baby has good telepathic abilities with you as a mother. During"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"352  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION the day, vividly describe things that you do and the reasons behind them -- from brushing your teeth to cooking and eating your food. To assist this process, visualize all your sensory experiences as they happen, and transmit the focus of your impressions toward your baby's head as the point of reception. S ince your own fears and anxieties can also be passed along to your fetal baby, minimize these and keep your emotions stable. A mother's negative emotional state can constrict the blood flow to the placenta and can produce oxygen deprivation in the womb. Besides suffering brain damage, a \"suffocation syndrome\" can occur which has the unusual effect in later life of feelings of panic, depression, fatigue and possible drug dependency. A love vibration is essential to good developmental growth. Healthy, physical exercise and a wholesome diet are recommended for you as the pregnant mother -- free of alcohol, nicotine, narcotics and white sugar intake. Choose positive, expressive and knowledgeable people associations, because remember, your baby is listening too. After delivery of the baby, love and an educational environment should be available as well."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  353 Exercise 206 -- Role Taking As An Actor If you've ever performed a part in a play, you know the more you actually become the individual you are portraying, the more convincing you are to an audi- ence. Internalizing this same role playing through visualization can often help you solve problems or overcome impasses in your life. As an exercise, think of someone you know or have heard about (past or present) that would be most likely to solve a particular dilemma in your life. Now visualize that person and step into his (her) shoes and fully associate yourself as being that somebody looking through their eyes. Act out in your mind exactly what that person would do to master your problem, step by step. Of course, you already know the answer to your problem, but by transferring yourself into the role of an acknowledged problem solver, you overcome the obstacle of not seeing it as yourself, but as someone else instead. Once you feel how it feels to solve your problem through visualization, you also realize what it will take to solve that problem in the real world too. Care must be taken with this exercise though, because every thought has an effect on the universe. Actors and famous people are often thought about by so many individuals that their minds must be constantly inundated with conflicting images received from other minds -- both serene and perverse. In fact, many people who have used this role playing technique have been utterly convinced that they were in actual mind synch with the person they were fantasizing. Experiments have shown that students in art classes can develop rapidly into advanced, sophisticated artists under hypnosis, when they believed themselves to be some famous painter of the past. Even in so doing they develop their own style and ability. Through the technique of self-hypnotic time distortion (review \"Exercise -- Learn Through Time Distortion\"), you can even create lengthy sessions of instruction and practice within only minutes of real time. Since a hypnotized person can impersonate someone fairly accurately, you can do it too, even without hypnosis. This practice of assuming beneficial roles can make big changes in your life. After studying successful men and women in various fields of endeavor, it has been found that there are fundamental behavioral traits that these people do over and over again to achieve their success. Success leaves clues by way of certain mental and physical characteristics that anyone can duplicate. If you do so, you'll produce the same successful results without going through the years of trial and error their originators did. Any form of human excellence can be duplicated in this way.

Then, take action, and move in an enthusiastic way with an effective strategy toward replicating the characteristics of the person that you've observed as successful. You can also create an internal visual image of this model person and step into it in a fully associated way and become that person you wish to emulate. As an experiment, the next time that you're at a party, choose someone to watch and speak to. As you are doing this, replicate their body language, posture, breathing and speech patterns, and see how favorable your rapport becomes with that person. The quick rapport that you establish is because you are exactly like that person in so many identical ways.

For instance, a popular party trick involves apparent 'telepathy' with a partner. The audience chooses an object (size does not matter) in the room while you are out of the room. You return and with your back turned or blindfolded, your partner points to various objects in the room. He says, \"Is this the object we chose?\" You say, \"No,\" until he points to the target object and you say, \"Yes.\" The trick can be done in various ways. Your partner and yourself can predesig- nate ahead of time that when the sixth object is pointed to -- it will be the correct one. You can vary it by coding the questioning to a different sentence when the correct one is pointed to. You can do it unblindfolded and agree with your partner ahead of time that the correct object will be after he points to a chair in the room or after he turns his pointing pencil around or after he points to something red in the room. Invent other cued variations between your partner and yourself. As an exercise, do this trick and let the group know that there is a subtlety that they are to pick up and repeat the trick the same way until they get it; or have each person write on a piece of paper what he thinks is the solution and silently review the papers to determine who got it. Then go to the next variation and proceed the same way.

This is part of the process of good judgment in evaluating people by first impressions. Unfortunately, the intuitive part of your judgment is often colored by bias and accepted norms that are inculcated into standardized ideologies. To truly scan a person's vibrational energies, you must get past the initial superficial remarks, the clothes and any other 'trappings' that are visibly apparent. You have to probe and read beyond the façade that is shown to you on the surface. Of course, most of what you will pick up from a person is what you yourself are dealing with in your own life! How can recognize in others what you yourself are not experiencing? T his exercise should only be done with honest, well-balanced individuals. Sit facing a partner and get into a relaxed frame of mind. You act as the scanner, and the other person acts as the subject. Look into each other's eyes for a few moments. Now tell the other person all you can about what you are picking up from him. Imagine and relate a story about what you think his life was like in the past. This is meant as a helpful exercise, so please concentrate on the positive points and feelings that you receive. Many times telepathic pictures and impressions will pop forth. At other times, there appears to be an intuitive knowing that takes place -- perhaps like subliminally reading the subject's aura or body language. As a variation to this exercise, blindfold yourself and hold the subject's hands (with jewelry removed) while scanning him. CAUTION: If either person has any reservations about revealing themselves to the other person, please don't participate in this exercise. This is not meant as an invasion of privacy, but simply as a mutual volitional exchange. You can practice using your scanning skill by looking at a stranger at a party and imagining what this person's life is like, where they've been and how knowledgeable they are. Create a story about all their imagined experiences, and then start a conversation with them to confirm how accurate you were. Another variation of this exercise can be done after you write down a question or a problem with which you need some help or want some information on. Without showing your partner what you have written, you begin to concentrate on it. Your partner closes his eyes and opens up his mind to your problem or question as you concentrate on it. He then begins to describe to you whatever symbols, words or images that come to him, and you write down whatever he says to you. Occasionally you might ask him a question about what he is picking up for clarification.

Dilation of your pupils takes place when you see something you like -- an attractive person, a winning poker hand, etc. Pictures of crippled children, feeding lions or unpleasant scenes contract the pupils. In times past, women dilated their eyes with belladonna (origin of atropine) to appear more attractive to men. The men subconsciously responded to the enlarged pupils and thought that the women were 'naturally' liking what they were seeing -- them . A lthough your perception of another person's signals can sometimes be misread or clouded by your own moods, prejudices or emotional attitudes, you'll find there are many subtle body mannerisms that are readily perceptible if you just take the time to tune into them (speech inflection, eye movements, posture, hand gestures, etc.) When a husband comes home from work, takes off his hat, hangs up his coat and says, \"Hi,\" to his wife, an observant spouse can easily discern how things went at the office for the day. Married couples often start quarrels with the same tone of voice, gesture or facial expression so that the other can anticipate a fight beginning almost immediately. To learn about body language, first get conscious of your own gestures. Observe and acknowledge what mannerisms you portray during a normal day's activities. Does your lip tighten when you internally are angry with someone? Do you lean forward or grip the edge of the table as an announcement that you have something to say? Do you point your index finger when you are accusing or disciplining someone? What are your mannerisms when you exaggerate or lie to someone? Studies have revealed that your own personal mood and prejudices can sometimes distort the signals you receive from someone else. So observe and get in tune with yourself and your own mannerisms as an important first step in reading the body language of others. As a practical exercise, work with a close friend, spouse or relative, and sit facing each other. Now think of a past scene or emotional incident that you are both familiar with that happened in the last few days. Then without telling your partner which incident you are thinking about, reveal your feelings about that incident with facial expressions, touching and various gestures. Afterwards, discuss the mannerisms together. By using various types of smiles, frowns and gestures, you often can communicate a lot of non-verbal meaning.

Then give him (her) a read-out of what you have perceived his (her) nature to be like. Be frank, but diplomatic. Avoid being overly critical.

No comments or nods of recognition are necessary from your partner during this process. This exercise is a good opportunity for you to see how another person interprets your bodily and facial mannerisms.

By innuendo and subtlety, do you begin to sense a bit of telepathy? Are emotional messages easier to transmit than non-emotional ones? Do you think you understand others and are being understood by others with more clarity or less clarity than with words? Do this same exercise with a friend or spouse for one half hour. Review the same points and questions as above.

These people often spend so much time covering up their own frailties with façades, internal blocks and verbal excuses that they often don't really bother getting to know others very well. All too often the non-thinking, emotional part of their brain expresses itself more frequently than the analytical, evaluating side of the brain. When such people do make an evaluation of another person, it often winds up being only an unconscious mirror version of what they have never admitted seeing in themselves. The more out of touch with yourself you are, the more inclined you are to produce a mirror reading of yourself for another person. When you learn to recognize undesirable emotional states in yourself, you're taking the 1st step toward changing these states. Reading other people accurately becomes easier for you then, because you act more like an observer. Now as an exercise, A) List 4 things in a notebook that would engulf you with compassion and love for your fellow man. B) List 4 things that would fill you with happiness, joy or contentment.

Misreading people and their intentions can often lead to trouble and great difficulty in your daily life. How you learn or don't learn from such difficulties can help OR hinder you later in life. Voice inflection, body mannerisms and eye expressions can be discerned subconsciously when you read people, or you can just as easily learn to read these signals consciously . For instance, great salespeople often observe carefully the body movements of potential customers. By mirroring and matching the body language and energy level of those they are about to sell to, good salespeople can thus establish a better buying receptivity in potential customers, because people generally feel more comfortable with other people that are like themselves.

Thomas Edison slept only 4 hours per night, thus adding 10 more years to his wakeful life. On July 8, 1943, Senora Ines Fernandez, 57, started a sleepless period that lasted over 30 years! While standing at her cottage door in a town in southwest Spain, she watched a religious procession and suddenly felt a searing pain in her head. She never slept again! No pills or medicines worked and doctors determined that this total insomnia was a result of the impairment of the sleep center of the brain. There have been other cases like this on medical record, but the phenomenon is extremely rare. In all studied cases of little or no sleep, individuals engaged in brief periods of dreamy relaxation during the day or night to recharge their body and mind. Through research with \"electrosleep\" (artificially induced sleep via electrodes that pulse a mild electrical current into the brain), it was learned that total relaxation cuts the necessary sleeping time down considerably. Most people toss and turn throughout the night, relaxing one set of muscles then another, until all the body's muscles have eventually undergone some form of relaxation. Through electrosleep, all the muscles are relaxed without the tossing and turning, and 1 or 2 hours of relaxed sleep under the sleep machine is equivalent to 8 hours of normal rest. This exercise should only be done after mastering \"Exercise -- Self-Hypnosis\" or \"Exercise -- Self-Induced Trance,\" and it certainly should not be performed if there is a medical reason to discourage it. Also this exercise will only be of benefit to you if you have special reasons to utilize it. Since most people spend 1/3 of their life asleep, dynamic individuals have found that sleeping less has enabled them to accomplish more. To proceed with this exercise, assume a comfortable position and get into a self- induced hypnotic state. While experiencing this relaxed state, repeat the following set of affirmations 3 times. \"My body and mind are filling with renewed energy. I am feeling rested and refreshed. The deeper I relax, the less sleep I need.\" Practice this exercise for 15 minutes 3 times a day. Within days, you will notice that you no longer desire as much sleep as you used to require. To rouse yourself back to a waking state, simply count slowly from 10 to 1 and progressively awaken yourself.

Psychotronic generators are devices that amplify your thought energy. After suffering under years of criticism, a lot of serious research has been done to validate such devices. Y ears ago the CIA reportedly learned that the Soviets were using powerful psychotronic generators to amplify and beam harmful ELF (extremely low frequency) thought transmissions to major U.S. cities (in some case using radio-microwaves as carrier waves). U.S. researchers undertook their own research to counteract the Soviet threat. Some researchers have found that producing and synchronizing man-made magnetic waves to the alpha brain wave frequency of 10 cycles per second in a subject could induce suppressed emotional images of fear. If amplified and generated directly at a segment of the population, these ELF waves could potentially manipulate people into producing bizarre behavioral patterns. Most people are already beset with various forms of ELF thought energy from other people around them all day long. This \"mental noise\" comes to you in the form of visualizations or voices and might constitute 50 - 75% of your idle thought patterns that often guide many of your impulse reactions. This subliminal entrainment of your mind is augmented constantly with what you see in newspapers and on the TV, and how you interact with other people. W hen high sun spot activity affects radio waves, people are affected too. Can your ELF thought transmissions be amplified by the constant presence of radio waves around you acting as carrier frequencies? The microwaves that the Soviets were using in a directional way might be already happening in a non-directional, worldwide way with radio waves (microwaves are radio wave frequencies). As the souls of the world pick up tempo in a spiral downhill toward decadence, other souls elsewhere in the world (radio waves are everywhere) could be entrained in similar behavior because of the amplified ELF thought transmissions carried by radio waves. How can you become a skilled individual to protect or shield yourself from unwanted ELF influences generated by millions of negatively oriented souls? Think a minute. First be aware that something must be happening like this already in the world today. If someone yelled fire in a theater, would you be easily swept up and phase-locked into a panicky condition? Do you react to unfamiliar situations in an individualistic thinking manner or in an emotional, group-oriented, non-thinking"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"366  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION capacity? To counteract the subliminal entrainment of your mind, question yourself periodically about your actions. Next, consciously clear your mind of all negative thought patterns. Well you say, \"That's what it's all about, isn't it?\" There's a difference though. If you knew someone was pointing a mind control gun at you to implant a subliminal, negative condition in you, wouldn't you CONSCIOUSLY want to counteract it and rebuff its influence? Of course you would. Then take conscious control over a positive life style for yourself, because negative influences ARE 'pointed' at you! Clear your mind of all the subliminal stuff that is subconsciously directing you into acting like a robot, and get down to living in a productive way. Improve yourself and develop your mental skills, instead of carrying around a deteriorating lump of gray matter with you all day that's too tired to think or even get conscious in the morning. Don't go for the pills or the booze or something to heighten or deaden the senses. The next time a negative surge is upon you, assume it is directed at you for a purpose, and refuse to countenance it. Use your conscious will power to reject the impression. Just as sound can cancel out sound, your natural electromagnetic energy field can do the same as long as you consciously direct it to do so. The more you personally increase your energy amplitude, the easier it will be to turn away an external focus of negativity (review \"Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health\"). As an exercise in projecting energy through your eyes, build the following psionic generator. First draw 2 perfect circles 7 1/2 inches in diameter with a protractor. Cut them out carefully with your scissors and cut an additional quarter piece out of each one leaving a flap. Now assemble the cones using a tiny center point indicated in diagram A and tie appropriate knots in your thread to position each one like in diagram B. The cone shape is chosen because it is similar to the pyramid shape in accumulating energy. Suspend the cones at slightly higher than eye level and away from drafts. Look away from them until they become still. Since the thread holes are off center, a slight angle is created. This angle affords greater sensitivity to your eye beam energy. Now look at the cones and observe the reaction. Slowly approach the bottom cone from below with the palm of your hand and notice the vibrating effect on both cones. Can a mirror reflect your eye beam energy to make the cones move? From what distance can you affect the cones? Does holding a quartz crystal increase the effect? Can you activate the device by simply visualizing that you're looking at it with your eyes closed? Can you affect it by look-"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  367 ing at it with your peripheral vision? If the cones were gradually increased in weight and size, could the amplitude of your eye beam energy be determined by the point you no longer could move the cones by looking at them?! As an exercise in amplifying your thought waves using a simple psychotronic de- vice, refer to the concentric squares made as a chart in \"Exercise -- Aura Seeing.\" Look at a picture of a friend to refresh your memory of her appearance. Then visualize the image of your friend in the center of the chart as you communicate a message to her. Use the tips in \"Exercise -- Audio Telepathy\" and \"Exercise -- Visual Telepathy\" as guides in this exercise. If you place a snip of hair of your friend (which carries her energy vibration) in the center of the chart in front of you flat on the table (don't place tape or any other material vibrations with it), the telepathic effect will be enhanced as you gaze into the center and send your message. The concentric squares represent the same effect as stacking pyramids to intensify energy output. Aligning one side to north and putting a small magnet under it with the N pole aimed to north also enhances the effect. Various psychotronic devices are sold under various names, but they're all simply tuning instruments that act as wave- guides for your thought transmissions.

By using the time distortion technique, telepathic transmission between two minds in 'synch' can convey great quantities of information in mere seconds. This is NOT a technique to rob another mind of information, but only one to transmit and receive bulk material in a volitional fashion. After mastering \"Exercise -- Audio Telepathy\" and \"Exercise -- Visual Telepathy,\" you are ready to combine those techniques with those learned in \"Exercise -- Learn Through Time Distortion.\" Assume a comfortable position and face your partner (who has also mastered the aforementioned exercises). Both of you should now get into a self-hypnotic state (review \"Exercise -- Learning Self-Hypnosis\") and clear your minds. Have someone start a metronome at 60 beats per minute. The sender now uses the time distortion technique, and experiences each beat interval as 4 minutes apart. The sender acknowledges that this is so by saying, \"I'm ready.\" The sender reviews the material mentally in a time distorted fashion as he reaches out with his mind and transmits it to the receiver. The receiver now mentally pulses his body towards the sender as in \"Exercise -- Audio Telepathy.\" Even though the receiver's mind is not in a time distorted mode, the transmission is readily acknowledged and received almost in a subliminal fashion. Depending upon many associative factors in the receiver's brain, the material will be retained for varying lengths of time. To amplify transmission, review \"Exercise -- Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health.\""},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  369 Exercise 216 -- Boosting Your Brain Power Your brain chemistry is affected by food and drink, exercise, thoughts, emotions, the air you breathe, etc. Powerful groups of chemicals in your brain react to these factors and can rev you up or slow you down accordingly. Oftentimes you get so accustomed to the way you are that you choose foods, thoughts and habits that will keep you in that state rather than change the routine and change the way you are - even to accepting negative moods as normal and positive moods as too good to last. If you moods are off balance, your intelligence, productivity and overall perfor- mance is affected. For example, when emotional interest triggers the secretion of adrenaline into the bloodstream, memory, thinking and sensory acuity is improved. Adrenaline also prompts the release of stored-up blood sugar (glucose) which neurons need for optimal performance, so avoid low blood sugar and artificial sweeteners when doing brain tasks. Your brain grows with exercise and atrophies with lack of use. Out of the estimated 15 billion neurons of the human brain, 100,000 unused neurons deteriorate each day. By improving your brain's circulatory system, your brain cells need not deteriorate at this horrendous rate. Capillaries that supply your brain cells with oxygen and nourishment can be manufactured by your body when they are needed. An autopsy of Einstein's brain after his death revealed that there was a greater profusion of superficial capillaries interlacing his cerebral cortex than men of ordinary intellect. With a program of intensive mental exercise, your body must respond with the development of new capillaries to provide the necessary oxygen your brain is asking for. O xygen is the key to better brain usage. If your heart rate is increased and your blood vessels are dilated, more oxygen can reach your brain; hence moderate exercise can improve your brain's functioning. Deep, abdominal breathing is also very good, because blood favors the lower areas of your lungs due to gravity, and a more enriched mixing of blood and oxygen is achieved (see breathing exercises). Improve your diet, and you can improve the functioning of your brain. For instance, by eating leafy vegetables, nuts, apples, pears or grapes you supply your brain with the much needed element boron that helps to increase your mental alertness. High fat foods make your brain feel sluggish. By eating low-fat poultry or fish, you charge up your bloodstream with amino acids, including tyrosine. Tyrosine is carried across the protective filter called the blood-brain barrier where it converts into the alertness chemicals, dopamine and norepinephrine. If stress exhausts your"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"370  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION supply of these neurotransmitters, the result is confusion, indecisiveness, anxiety and depression. Fish, meats, egg yolks, soy products, oatmeal, rice, peanuts and pecans contain choline which converts to the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, needed for a sharp memory. You can further augment your ability to think and learn by taking supplemental dosages of choline (or lecithin), vitamin A, B-1, B-12, C and E. Eliminate smoking and excessive fluid intake (which is mostly habit and not thirst anyway), narcotics, alcohol, white sugar (which produces lassitude and fatigue) and excess caffeine intake (which limits the blood flow in your brain). Coffee is an instant dopamine booster, which tends to make us think more quickly, react to stimuli more rapidly, and feel more energetic. But dopamine is a building block of another neurotransmitter, norephinephrine which converts to adrenaline. More than one or two cups of coffee often pushes the brain chemicals to excessive levels resulting in nervousness, anxiety and aggression. Mental instability is simply a chemical imbalance. To balance yourself, moderation in everything is best. To improve hemispheric balance, cross-crawling (stomach-to-floor) is a good developmental exercise. Practice marching in place. First march in a homolateral style, moving the same side arm and leg together, and then switch to the opposite side arm and leg in a cross-marching style. Practice other cross-motor patterns like swinging both arms to one side while lifting the leg of the other side in front of you OR lifting your leg straight out to the side while raising your arm of the opposite side. Turn your head from side to side as you do these drills. Do each cross-motor pattern 25 times per day until it becomes automatic for you. To further boost your brain power, sharpen the whole range of your senses. See, hear, taste, smell and feel the environment around you. Do things differently each day and encourage yourself with positive affirmations. Use your left hand instead of your right to open your car door or to comb your hair. Break out of the hypnotic stereotypes of taking the same roads home from work or the routines at the breakfast and lunch table, etc. At home, play thinking games like bridge, checkers, chess or go. Build up your vocabulary. Do crossword puzzles, anagrams and jumble word puzzles. Practice reading and drawing upside down or while looking through a mirror. Learn another language or how to play a musical instrument. At various points in your day, visualize in quick succession all the daily activities that happened to you up to that point. The more you use your brain, the more it will grow."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION  371 Exercise 217 -- Body Rhythms and Cycles (Chronobiology) The study of biological rhythms and cycles is called chronobiology. Each one of your body's rhythms has its own timing. There are cycles governing body temperature, blood pressure, hormone levels, iron concentration in the bloodstream, heart rate, memory, mathematical acuity, sexual appetite, blood sugar levels, sleep, white blood cell count, hand strength, sensitivity to pain, eye-hand coordination, etc. Your subconscious mind interrelates your body rhythms and energies with your environment to bring about your ailments, accidents and stressful situations. You are not an innocent victim of daily events and circumstances. You create them! In many instances, this process occurs during 37-hour cycles -- beginning with negative, emotional repression and ending with ailments or mishaps. For example, think back to when you last got a cold. Did something 37 hours prior to catching your cold emotionally upset you? Strong emotion sets the body clock into motion. As an exercise, keep a diary and record the exact hour that you next \"blow off steam,\" and be careful with your activities 37 hours later. Also, reverse the process. Meditate or create a joyful, loving atmosphere about yourself 37 hours prior to an important meeting or event in your life and notice how well things go for you. Like the surface of the earth, man is 80% water and 20% solids (salinity and minerals in the blood and body tissues are also similar to the oceans). The moon affects your fluids in a gravitational way like the oceans of the world. At a new and full moon, tides are at their highest and the moon's effect is at its strongest on your behavior. Violent crime, fires and accidents are at their highest. Psychiatric ward attendants know that at a full moon, mental patients evidence increased, aberrant behavior. A massive disturbance in gravity due to the 29.5-day lunar cycle brings about mood shifts -- especially with those people least in control of their conscious lives. Telepathic abilities of people also increase during a full moon. Gross electromagnetic forces originating with celestial bodies affect the electro- magnetic fields around and through your body -- right down to the tiniest cell. For instance, when the sun reverses its polarity every 11.5 years (north to south), there is a high incidence of sun spots. The resulting electromagnetic fluctuations bring about weather changes, radio transmission disruptions and anxiety manifestations in many people. Remember though, whenever external conditions disrupt your body's rhythms, conscious directives can adjust them. You have just as much control over your body as you think you have, so begin exercising that control.

(Could telepathic or psychokinetic abilities be amplified with higher body temperatures?) While chronobiology is being studied, implementation of research results are slow in being accepted. Should the body rhythms of surgeons as well as the patients be considered before operations?

After correcting your own dishonest tendencies, you probably noticed that you are more prone to believing and trusting others now than you were before. Formerly, you doubted everything that you heard, because you yourself could not be relied upon for factual information. It was a natural assumption that other people were the same. Now that you have become honest, you assume others are likewise. When you discover they are not, you have to deal with it. To spot a liar, body language is the key -- red spots on the cheeks, fidgeting posture, clenching of fists, vocal stress or quivering voice, nervous laughter, a tapping foot, an exaggerated effort to appear casual, etc. all can depict dishonesty. Also, adding too much to a story or taking charge of a conversation to distract or divert you can be telltale signs of lying. Mostly though, the eyes are the windows to the mind, the character, the habits and the soul of a person. Beware of excessive shifting or downcast eyes or eyes that you intuit to be untrustworthy, cruel, crafty, sarcastic, revengeful or hateful when you fully look into them. If you've learned to see auras, you'll notice a greenish-yellow streak shoot through a person's aura when he tells a lie (review \"Exercise -- Aura Seeing\"). The need to be right and not take the responsibility to be wrong is so strong in some people that they will even invent whole conversations that never took place just to say, \"I told you so.\" Liars have many subconscious reasons for lying, and some liars no longer can tell the difference between truth and lie. Normally when a liar is exposed, he still maintains his lie in a struggle not to have it openly revealed. As an exercise, the next time you catch someone lying, blame the cause of the episode on a nameless third party. This has a marvelous effect of allowing the liar to save face, and for you to achieve what you want without too much anxiety. Your son denies leaving his bike in the driveway, but he'll put it away without a fuss if you say it must have been one of the neighbor's kids. The mechanic didn't replace the spark plugs he charged you for, so blaming the mistake on his 'anonymous' helper will get them replaced properly without any trouble. The liar suspects that you know he lied, and calling him a liar would not get what you want done. People have to correct their own lying tendencies.

Psychologically speaking, if your first impression with a person revolves around"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"374  GENERAL MIND STIMULATION something he thinks you are wrong about or lied about, it causes any further statements from you to be regarded with suspicion. First impressions of being a truth teller have the same effect. Whenever a person makes up his mind about you as a truth teller or a liar in the beginning, he is loath to change his mind afterwards, because it would mean he was wrong about you. People rarely like to admit they are wrong in such matters. This is also at the root of most difficulties in interpersonal relationships. People tend to put out good impressions in the beginning of a relationship, even if it is a false one. Partners that swallow a false impression are very reluctant to change their minds afterwards, and they will tend to defend their position tenaciously. It simply is too tough an admission for most people to admit they were wrong. Consequently, whenever you meet someone for the first time, always maintain honesty and seek some common boundary of accord that you both can agree upon. After the person has made up his (her) mind about you as a factual truth teller, all your future statements will be accepted with that same faith.

All environmental perceptions affect you through their form. Through visualiza- tion, it is possible for a skilled individual to negate the effects of form, but for most people, how you resonate with form and the energies absorbed by it determines how you are affected by it. To bring balance and harmony in your life, associate yourself with symbols that will benefit and help you. As an exercise to test someone's reaction to symbols kinesiologically (see \"Exercise -- Improve Your Physical Strength In 7 Days\"), have the person stand in front of you with his right arm relaxed at his side and his left arm held straight out parallel to the floor. Place your left hand on his right shoulder and your right hand on the person's extended left arm just above the wrist. Without smiling or frowning (because this can affect the test), tell the person to resist with all his strength as you try to push his extended arm down. Push down on his arm briefly and firmly and test the strength and spring in the arm. Now show him different symbols to determine which symbols test weak and which test strong. When he tests weak on a symbol and the arm goes down easily, then it is obviously a symbol affecting his energy system in a negative way. Experiment with the 5-pointed star vs the 6-pointed star, a clockwise spiral vs a counterclockwise spiral, a hexagon vs a pentagon, the top half of a circle (a frown) vs the bottom half of a circle (a smile), etc. a frown  a smile In lieu of displaying the symbols physically, have the testee simply visualize them and note the results. If no partner is available, use a kinesiometer or dynamometer for your own individual muscle testing. Using the Greek cross where the vertical and horizontal arms are of equal length, most people do not test weak. Using the Roman cross where the bottom portion of the vertical arm is longer diminishes your strength and you usually test weak.

It's as if they wanted to stay stuck in their situation?! Avoidance of responsibility and fear of making a mistake keeps many people confused. It was once said, \"Life is easy, it's the decisions in life that are tough.\" How many times have you thought or said you would do one thing, but wound up doing something totally different or nothing at all? Do you put off or take the time to do little 3 minute tasks around the house? So m uch time is wasted everyday by most people in unproductive pursuits and activities. Have you ever said to someone, \"I don't have time to do (such and such)?\" Some of the busiest people in the world find time in their lives to do the things they want to do. How? They make the time by proper scheduling! To them, there is no such thing as not having the time to do something. They create it by first NOT programming their minds that they don't have the time to spare. As an exercise in utilizing all time morsels of the day to your advantage, carry a little jingle bell in your pocket as a periodic reminder. Every time you hear the little bell tinkle, practice one of the manual exercises. Stop exaggerating in conversations (review \"Exercise -- Honesty For Better Clarity\").

Drink in and absorb the simultaneity of your surroundings (review \"Exercise -- A Multiple Hearing Acuity\").

Whereas normal subjects that tried to fake multiple personalities could not alter their brain wave patterns significantly. There are those of you that believe in demonic influences and those of you that do not. It doesn't matter, because this exercise is for either school of thought. If harmful, spirit entities draw to your negative, emotional behavior to accentuate or augment it, the reverse has got to repel them. \"Resist not evil,\" simply means not to grapple or fight it in a resisting fashion. Instead embrace it in a loving fashion (\"Love thy enemy\"). Pure, selfless, unqualified love is a powerful force. It has nothing to do with sex or lust, but everything to do with true power over evil. Most people rarely experience it. Think of a moment in your past when you came close to experiencing selfless love (parent for child, child for parent, spouse for spouse), and concentrate on that feeling. Now visualize a goblin-type entity called Mr. Fear around the person who appears to have a nasty, uncontrollable side to his personality. Visualize yourself alongside that person while you are generating unselfish love and both of you are seeking to embrace Mr. Fear. Visualize next either Mr. Fear running away or disintegrating in your embrace. Do this exercise at least 3 times a day and watch the effect that it has on the other person. Don't even let the other person know what you are doing.

Looking at something bright yellow seems to cheer people up and invites an outward release of feeling and emotion. By changing certain color schemes in manufacturing plants, accident rates could drop sharply. Changing to certain color combinations in school classrooms could improve the learning ability of students. Proper color codes in assembly-line factories could reduce fatigue and monotony, and increase efficiency. Hospital recovery rooms could be repainted for less pain and suffering of patients. Through the research of Gabriel Cousens, M.D., it was found that the color of a food reflects a certain frequency that resonates and bonds specific cells and tissues in our bodies. He further correlated individual colors with the body's seven individual chakras. Ingesting certain colored foods can energize, cleanse, build and rebalance the glands, organs and nerve centers associated with the corresponding chakra of the same color. Foods selected by color can in turn have a corresponding therapeutic effect. Again of course, the food must be ingested in as pure a state as possible for maximum effect. Raw, freshly picked and organically grown vegetables and fruits are preferable. The longer wavelengths of the red end of the spectrum have distinctly different reactions on living things than the blue end of the spectrum. Crops grow differently in red and blue light. For instance, grape vines mature faster and produce fruit quicker under blue light. Under red light, radishes grow quite large. Chinchillas raised under blue light produce litters with more females, and mink raised under pink light produce more males. Under the short wavelengths of blue light, time is likely to be underestimated. Under the long wavelengths of red light, time is overestimated, and feels like it is in slow motion. Things seem longer and heavier under red, and shorter and lighter under blue. To the dark adapted eye, red signals are still perceived as flashing at 75 times per minute, whereas blue flashing fuses into an illusion of being continuous at more than 20 times per minute. Simultaneous sounds increase the sensitivity of the eyes to blue light, but decrease their sensitivity to red. People exposed to red light experience an increase in blood pressure, but with continued exposure to the color, the effect is reversed and the blood pressure decreases below normal. Blue light decreases the blood pressure at first, but then causes it to rise after prolonged exposure.

It seems therefore that color stimulation for therapeutic application should be organized in terms of brief periods of single colors alone, and given in alternating spurts for maximum benefit. Imagine homes, offices and classrooms of the future where the color of room walls are programmed to change automatically every 3 minutes to whatever color is conducive to the desired result. One researcher found that one inherited type of dyslexia called, \"scotopic sensi- tivity syndrome,\" seems responsive to specific color wavelengths of light. By using different colored overlays or color tinted lenses, reading difficulties for these dyslexics were often alleviated. Even some \"normal\" readers could increase their reading speed with colored overlays. The color seems to modify the light that goes to the eye, and therefore reduce the distortions that a reader previously perceived. Not everyone responds to the same colors in the same way out of 150 color tints used, ranging from deep blue to red. For this reason, subjects choose the color tint that makes the printed page more distinct and readable to them. Tinted lenses by themselves are not a cure for a specific reading problem, but instead they enhance the effect of remedial educational practices. When another researcher attached electrodes to the eyes of 20 subjects, he found that different colored lights registered specific electrical patterns as each subject perceived each distinct color. Since some people have a better ability to vividly visualize, he further found that 5 out of the 20 subjects could produce the same electrical patterns by just imagining each color! In fact, they could produce this electrical pattern of an imagined color at the same time that a different color was flashing before their eyes! In other words, the mind's imagined perception could override actual perception. This is something that hypnotists have been demon- strating with subjects for quite some time. To be able to visualize colors not only brings about a clarity to your memory and imagination, but it also improves your perceptual vision as well. As a daily exercise, watch people and things displaying brilliant colors. When you see a bright color, close your eyes and visualize the color. Recreate it with more intensity and imagination in your mind's eye. Breathe steadily and deeply while doing this, and when you open your eyes, you'll see an improved difference in your color perception. Next, choose a color and make a list of all the things you saw with that color on the way to work, school or to the store. Check yourself for accuracy the next time you make the same trip.

You should experience disquieting or uncomfortable feelings. Once you are able to visualize colors distinctly, you can use your talent of color visualization on people in need. If a friend is tired or fatigued, visualize him being flooded with bright, invigorating red light, followed by brilliant yellows and finalized with a treatment of warm, orange light. If a person is nervous or hyperactive, treat him to a mental bath of violet or lavender light. Do the same for yourself.

A wise man once said, \"If all the money in the world were equally divided up so that every person in the world had exactly the same amount of money, it would be right back to where it is now in a very short span of time!\" Why? Because it is a person's internal attitude that keeps people where they are financially, not external circumstances. People keep saying, \"If only I had more money, all my problems would be solved.\" If money brought happiness, then why are so many millionaires unhappy? How often millionaires feel like they are all alone in a cave filled with treasure and there’s no way out of the cave! If you learned that all it took to become a millionaire was to write and say, \"I am a millionaire,\" 50 times each day for a solid year, would you do it? You probably wouldn't, because it would be just too much trouble, and you would have too many doubts that it would work. Unfortunately, that is exactly what keeps people from becoming millionaires, or for that matter from achieving almost anything else they want in life - doubt and exerting the necessary effort to get the job done. If you change your attitude towards yourself and the things around you, you can change your life. I’m sure you’ve seen this in your experiences already. How many things in your life have changed simply because you changed your emotional attitude toward them? Most people drift through life always taking the easiest or most decision-free path, and experiencing doubts about almost everything they do along the way. How can you expect to achieve highly, if these personality flaws are constantly tripping you all throughout your life? Do you realize that many people are making millions at what you only do as an enjoyable hobby or a pastime? Do you want to be a millionaire? Convince yourself you already are one. If I told you that you were already a millionaire born with certain \"stock certificates of life\" that you could cash in for one million dollars, you wouldn't understand it.

Replay the same movie over and over to yourself from the time of acquisition of your wealth to what you're going to do with your wealth. If the visualization is a bit fuzzy, write it down first. You have seen how wealthy people live on TV. Imagine yourself in their shoes, and hold onto that vision for 30 seconds or longer while you feel how it feels to have wealth. Involve all your senses in visualizing yourself as a millionaire. Taste, smell, see, touch and hear all forms of input that you can associate with being a millionaire. Allow no worrisome blocks to obscure your visualization. See yourself managing money like a financial wizard. Imagine yourself receiving checks and cash, and disbursing it with intelligent shrewdness. Accompany the imaging process with the verbal affirmation, \"I am a millionaire,\" and repeat it over and over to yourself as you visualize your wealth. Say to yourself, \"Abundant wealth is flowing to me and through me in ever increasing amounts. I deserve wealth now because the supply is endless and inexhaustible. I am prosperous, productive and filled with thanksgiving for all the fortune that comes to me.\" Write your affirmations down dozens of times during the idle moments of your day. Say them to yourself as you drive to work or during odd moments throughout the day, but reiterate them verbally, mentally or in written form at least 50 times each day. Remember, affirmations work -- even affirmations like, \"I don't believe in affirmations.\" By reiterating what you want over and over, you're increasing your expectations of yourself. Eventually, what you shape as your inner reality will manifest itself to become your outer reality and events will shape themselves to suit the conditions you expect. Give yourself permission and commit yourself to becoming a millionaire. Relieve yourself of old programs and limitations you adopted over the years. Take action toward your goals, be flexible and “let go” to allow the process to unfold. If you’re at ease with money, it’ll always come to you as you need it, and often in ways you least expect it. It would certainly do you no harm to think this way for a year, would it? Besides, if you did persevere with such action for 1 year, such focus and determination would definitely change your life. If you want fast results, commit yourself to getting started right away and do whatever is necessary to achieve your goal. Every day do something that contributes toward your goal.

You have all the wealth you need to do anything you want in life. You have just to access it. Everything you need to be happy, wealthy and prosperous is within you. Feel yourself worthy of abundance. If you think thoughts of scarcity, you manifest limitation. If you think thoughts of abundance, you manifest sufficiency, happiness and wealth. You already have so many things in common with existent millionaires anyway. You see similar TV shows and read similar newspapers. You attend and enjoy similar entertainment. Your transportation is similar -- cars, planes or trains. You have similar emotional problems with your spouse and children. You wear only one suit of clothes at a time and you eat 2 or 3 meals a day. You shave, groom and attend to your toilet duties in a similar way. Basically you experience the same emotional ups and downs throughout the day, and soon you will have to contend with the reality of what to do with all your money in a similar way. It's a big responsibility to have so much money, so don't sacrifice your higher aspirations for the sake of it. Practice noticing the wonderful things in your life already and be thankful. When you recognize the abundance you already have, you dissipate lack in your life and attract more good things to you. Also, you'll find that you can best start the process of receiving what you want when you first begin by giving. Even forgiving people of the debts that are owed to you is a form of giving (review \"Exercise -- Obtaining Money & Material Things\"). It is better to seek money while helping others in some way (a win-win situation) than to seek money and hurt others in some way (a win- lose situation). Be sure though that wealth is really what you want before you bring it upon yourself. Ask yourself how much money will it take for you to feel good about yourself? How much money is enough for you? Wanting more no matter how much you have never brings a concept of sufficiency to mind. If on the other hand you know you will always have enough, the frustration of constantly seeking more never enters the picture. Having mastery over money so that the lack of it or the abundance of it does not control you is the true state of being wealthy.
