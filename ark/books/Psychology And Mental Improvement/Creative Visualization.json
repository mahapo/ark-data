We had no capital and almost no experi- ence, but after each small step we took, the next small step became obvious. I feel we were led into the publishing business by some higher power (or whatever you want to call it) far beyond either one of us. In 1978, Shakti wrote her first book, Creative Visualization. We initially printed two thousand copies of the book. We had to borrow money to pay the printing bill. I don’t recall that we spent anything at all on promotion; I don’t think we sent out even one review copy. But the print run sold out, quickly, purely through word of mouth. Booksellers kept telling us that people would come in, buy a copy, and return a few days later and want five or ten copies to give to their friends. The book initially sold itself — something I attribute to Shakti’s clear, beautiful writing style, as well as the solid content of the book. It was the kind of book people wanted to read and reread, the kind of book people cherished for everything it had given them. It was the rare kind of book that helped people make wonderful changes in their lives. \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 vii Creative Visualization-Front 1/23/01 5:07 PM Page vii"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"We started to get enthusiastic letters from readers very soon after publication. One of my favorites beautifully summed up the feelings of a great many readers: “Other self-help books I’ve read have made me feel as if someone was pointing a finger at me and telling me, ‘This is how it is!’ But Shakti took me by the hand, led me into a beautiful garden, and handed me a bouquet of flowers, one at a time. Quietly, gently, and with great caring. Thank you for a beautiful book.” Creative Visualization has now sold more than three mil- lion copies in the U.S., and has been reprinted in more than twenty-five foreign editions. The book launched Shakti’s career as an internationally known and loved speaker and seminar leader, and it launched my career as a publisher as well. The book has shown us both how to visualize and create success, and I am eternally grateful that Shakti had the vision and courage to write it. It is my hope and prayer that reading Creative Visualization will help you create exactly the kind of life you want, so that you truly will be happy, fulfilled, prosperous, radiantly healthy, filled with love, joy, and creative energy. It is the promise of the book, and it has been proven, over and over, that the book delivers what it promises.

At the time I was thirty years old, and just in the process of discovering my life’s work. For a number of years I had been an active seeker, dedicating myself to exploring Eastern philosophy and Western psychology in an attempt to discover the deeper meaning and purpose of my life. Certain ideas and techniques I had learned were, in fact, having a profound effect on my awareness and my way of living. I’m the kind of person who, once I discover something meaningful, simply can’t help telling everyone who’s willing to listen. So I found myself beginning to counsel people and lead small groups and workshops, teaching the concepts and exer- cises that were helping me solve my personal problems and expand my awareness. It occurred to me that it might be a good idea to write these things down in a little book that I could make available to my students. As I was writing the book, I experienced alternating waves of creative enthusiasm and self-doubt, thinking, “Who am I to write a book telling people how to find greater happiness and fulfillment in life? I’m certainly no expert. My life isn’t perfect.” My friend Marc Allen helped me get through the rough spots, encouraging me to stop worrying about it and just focus \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-Front 1/23/01 5:07 PM Page ix"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"on my creative process. We decided to publish the book our- selves, even though we had very little knowledge of publishing and even less money. Somehow we managed to get the book out there in a few bookstores. The rest is history. People seemed to love the book, and it sold by word of mouth. Gradually over the next few years it became a bestseller, and continues to be very popular to this day, all over the world. I think one reason for its popularity is that it is short, simple, practical, and has techniques that read- ers can begin using immediately and effectively. It has been extremely satisfying to receive thousands of let- ters telling me how much this book has helped people with spe- cific and sometimes serious problems. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to contribute in this way. My work has blossomed right along with the book. For many years I have been leading workshops all over the world, and I have written and published several other books. Creative Visualiza- tion helped me find my path in life, just as it has helped others. The time has come for a revised edition. I have made rela- tively few changes, simply trying to clarify certain points, deep- en certain concepts, and generally update it. If you are already familiar with the first edition, I hope you enjoy the changes.

In the past, many of us have used our power of creative visualization in a relatively unconscious way. Because of our own deep-seated negative concepts about life, we have auto- matically and unconsciously expected and imagined lack, limitation, difficulties, and problems to be our lot in life.

The use of creative visualization gives us a key to tap into the natural goodness and bounty of life. Imagination is the ability to create an idea, a mental pic- ture, or a feeling sense of something. In creative visualiza- tion you use your imagination to create a clear image, idea, or feeling of something you wish to manifest. Then you con- tinue to focus on the idea, feeling, or picture regularly, giv- ing it positive energy until it becomes objective reality . . . in other words, until you actually achieve what you have been imagining. Your goal may be on any level — physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual. You might imagine yourself with a new home, or with a new job, or having a satisfying relationship, or feeling calm and serene, or perhaps with an improved memory and learning ability.

If that doesn’t work, or if you feel that you would prefer a new job, then focus on imagining yourself in the employment situation that you desire. Either way, the technique is basically the same. After relaxing into a deep, quiet, meditative state of mind, imag- ine that you are working in your ideal job situation. Imagine yourself in the physical setting or environment that you would like, doing work that you enjoy and find satisfying, interacting with people in a harmonious way, receiving appreciation and appropriate financial compensation.

It should be noted here that this technique cannot be used to “control” the behavior of others or cause them to do something against their will. Its effect is to dissolve our internal barriers to natural harmony and self-realization, allowing everyone to manifest in his or her most positive aspect. To use creative visualization it is not necessary to believe in any metaphysical or spiritual ideas, though you must be willing to entertain certain concepts as being possible. It is not necessary to “have faith” in any power outside yourself. The only thing necessary is that you have the desire to enrich your knowledge and experience, and an open enough mind to try something new in a positive spirit.

Our physical universe is not really composed of any “matter” at all; its basic component is a kind of force or essence that we call energy . Things appear to be solid and separate from one anoth- er on the level at which our physical senses normally perceive them. On finer levels, however, atomic and subatomic levels, seemingly solid matter is seen as smaller and smaller parti- cles within particles, which eventually turn out to be just pure energy. 8 How Creative Visualization Works Creative Visualization-One 1/23/01 5:44 PM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Physically, we are all energy, and everything within and around us is made up of energy. We are all part of one great energy field. Things that we perceive to be solid and separate are in reality just various forms of our essential energy which is common to all. We are all one, even in a literal, physical sense. The energy is vibrating at different rates of speed, and thus has different qualities, from finer to denser. Thought is a relatively fine, light form of energy and therefore very quick and easy to change. Matter is relatively dense, compact ener- gy, and therefore slower to move and change. Within matter there is great variation as well. Living flesh is relatively fine, changes quickly, and is easily affected by many things. A rock is a much denser form, slower to change, and more difficult to affect. Yet even rock is eventually changed and affected by the fine, light energy of water, for example. All forms of ener- gy are interrelated and can affect one another. Energy Is Magnetic One law of energy is this: Energy of a certain quality or vibration tends to attract energy of a similar quality and vibration. Thoughts and feelings have their own magnetic energy that attracts energy of a similar nature. We can see this prin- ciple at work, for instance, when we “accidentally” run into How Creative Visualization Works 9 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-One 1/23/01 5:44 PM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"someone we’ve just been thinking of, or “happen” to pick up a book that contains exactly the perfect information we need at that moment. Form Follows Idea Thought is a quick, light, mobile form of energy. It manifests instantaneously, unlike the denser forms such as matter. When we create something, we always create it first in thought form. A thought or idea always precedes manifesta- tion. “I think I’ll make dinner” is the idea that precedes cre- ation of a meal. “I want a new dress,” precedes going and buying one; “I need a job” precedes finding one, and so on. An artist first has an idea or inspiration, then creates a painting. A builder first has a design, then builds a house. The idea is like a blueprint; it creates an image of the form, which then magnetizes and guides the physical energy to flow into that form, and eventually manifests it on the physical plane. The same principle holds true even if we do not take direct physical action to manifest our ideas. Simply having an idea or thought, holding it in your mind, is an energy that will tend to attract and create that form on the material plane. If you constantly think of illness, you may eventually become ill; if you believe yourself to be beautiful, you 10 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-One 1/23/01 5:44 PM Page 10"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"become so. Unconscious ideas and feelings held inside of us operate in the same way. The Law of Radiation and Attraction This is the principle that whatever you put out into the universe will be reflected back to you. “As you sow, so shall you reap.” What this means from a practical standpoint is that we always attract into our lives whatever we think about the most, believe in most strongly, expect on the deepest levels, and/or imagine most vividly. When we are negative and fearful, insecure or anxious, we often attract the very experiences, situations, or people that we are seeking to avoid. If we are basically positive in attitude, expecting and envisioning pleasure, satisfaction, and happiness, we tend to attract and create people, situa- tions, and events that conform to our positive expectations. So, consciously imagining what we want can help us to man- ifest it in our lives.

In the process we often discover ways in which we have been holding ourselves back, blocking ourselves from achieving satisfaction and fulfillment in our lives through our fears and unconscious beliefs. Once seen clearly, these limiting atti- tudes can often be dissolved through the creative visualiza- tion process, leaving space for us to find and live a natural state of greater happiness, fulfillment, and love .... At first you may practice creative visualization at specif- ic times and for specific goals. As you get more in the habit of using it, and begin to trust the results it can bring you, you will find that it becomes an integral part of your thinking process. It becomes a continuous awareness, a state of con- sciousness in which you know that you are the constant cre- ator of your life. That is the ultimate point of creative visualization — to make every moment of our lives a moment of wondrous cre- ation, in which we are just naturally choosing the best, the most beautiful, the most fulfilling lives we can imagine. . . . 12 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-One 1/23/01 5:44 PM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"H ere is an exercise in the basic technique of creative visualization: First, think of something you would like.

If you like, you can end your visualization with the firm statement to yourself: This, or something better, now manifests for me in totally satisfying and harmonious ways, for the highest good of all concerned. This statement leaves room for something different and even better than you had originally envisioned happening, and serves as a reminder to you that this process only func- tions for the mutual benefit of all. If doubts or contradictory thoughts arise, don’t resist them or try to prevent them. This will tend to give them a power they don’t otherwise have. Just let them flow through your consciousness, acknowledge them, and return to your positive statements and images. Do this process only as long as you find it enjoyable and interesting. It could be five minutes or half an hour. Repeat every day, or as often as you can. As you see, the basic process is relatively simple.

When your body and mind are deeply relaxed, your brain wave pattern actually changes and becomes slower. This deeper, slower level is commonly called the alpha level (while your usual busy waking consciousness is called the beta level), and much research is currently being done on its effects. The alpha level has been found to be a very healthful state of consciousness, because of its relaxing effect on mind and body. And, interestingly enough, it has been found to be far more effective than the more active beta level in creating real changes in the so-called objective world, through the use of visualization.

Usually, though, a little practice in relaxation makes perfect. Of course, a side benefit of all of this is that you will find deep relaxation healthful and beneficial mentally, emotionally, and physically. It is especially good to do creative visualization at night just before sleeping, or in the morning just after awakening, because at those times the mind and body are already deeply relaxed and receptive. You might like to do it while lying in bed, but if you tend to fall asleep, it’s best to sit up on the edge of the bed or in a chair in a comfortable position, with your spine straight and balanced.

In the active mode we con- sciously choose and create what we wish to see or imagine. Both these processes are an important part of creative visu- alization, and both your receptive and active abilities will be strengthened through practice. Special Problems with Visualization Occasionally a person has completely blocked his* abili- ty to visualize or imagine at will, and feels that he simply “can’t do it.” This type of block usually arises from a fear, and it can be worked through if the person who experiences the difficulty desires to solve the problem. Usually a person blocks his ability to use creative visual- ization out of a fear of what he may encounter by looking inside himself — fear of his own unacknowledged feelings and emotions.

It turned out that he had once had a profoundly emotional experience during a visualization process, and he was afraid he would be embarrassed by becoming emotional in front of others. A woman client of mine had difficulty visualizing until she went through therapy and was able to get in touch with, experience, and release painful feelings that she had buried inside since childhood. The truth is that there is nothing within us that can hurt us; it is only our fear of experiencing our own feelings that can keep us trapped. If anything unusual or unexpected arises during medita- tion, the best thing is simply to look at it fully, be with it and experience it as much as you can, and you will find that it eventually will lose any negative power over you. Our fears arise from things we don’t confront. Once we are willing to look fully and deeply at the source of a fear, it loses its power. If we feel overwhelmed, it can be very helpful to get support from a good counselor or therapist who can help us accept and express our feelings. This is especially important if we’ve had a lot of pain or trauma in our lives. Fortunately, problems with visualization are relatively rare.

Create a Clear Idea or Picture Create an idea, a mental picture, or a feeling of the object or situation exactly as you want it. You should think of it in the present tense as already existing the way you want it to be. Imagine yourself in the situation as you desire it, now. Include as many details as you can. You may wish to make an actual physical picture of it as well, by making a treasure map (described in detail later). This is an optional step, not at all necessary, but often help- ful (and fun!). 3. Focus on It Often Bring your idea or mental picture to mind often, both in quiet meditation periods, and also casually throughout the day when you happen to think of it. In this way it becomes an integrated part of your life, it becomes more of a reality for you, and you project it more successfully. Focus on it clearly, yet in a light, relaxed way. It’s impor- tant not to feel like you are striving too hard for it or putting an excessive amount of energy into it — that tends to hinder rather than help. 4.

While you use affirma- tions, try to temporarily suspend any doubts or disbelief you may have, at least for the moment, and practice getting the feeling that that which you desire is very real and possible. Continue to work with this process until you achieve your goal, or no longer have the desire to do so. Remember that goals often change before they are realized, which is a perfectly natural part of the human process of change and growth. So don’t try to prolong it any longer than you have energy for it — if you lose interest it may mean that it’s time for a new look at what you want. If you find that a goal has changed for you, be sure to acknowledge that to yourself. Get clear in your mind the fact that you are no longer focusing on your previous goal. End the cycle of the old, and begin the cycle of the new. This helps you avoid getting confused, or feeling that you’ve “failed” when you have simply changed. When you achieve a goal, be sure to acknowledge con- sciously to yourself that it has been completed. Often we achieve things that we have been desiring and visualizing, and we forget to even notice that we have succeeded!

What works for one person may not work at all for another. An affirmation should feel positive, expansive, free- ing, and/or supportive. If it doesn’t, find another one, or try changing the words until it feels right. Of course, you may feel emotional resistance to any affir- mation when you first use it, especially one which is really powerful for you and is going to make a real change in your consciousness. That is simply our natural fear of change and growth. 5. Always remember that you are creating something new and fresh. You are not trying to redo or change what already exists.

In some inner way, we have a sense of helplessness; we feel basi- cally powerless to make real change in our lives or in the world. This inner feeling of powerlessness causes us to overcompen- sate by striving and struggling very hard to have some degree of power or control in our world. Most of us, therefore, become very goal-oriented; we become emotionally attached to things and people outside of ourselves which we feel we need in order to be happy. We feel there is something “missing” inside ourselves, and we become tense, anxious, and stressed, continuously trying to fill up the gap, trying to manipulate the outside world in order to get what we want. This is the state of being from which most of us are set- ting goals and trying to create what we want in life, and unfortunately from this level of consciousness it doesn’t work at all . . . either we set up so many obstacles for our- selves that we can’t succeed, or we do succeed in reaching our goals only to find that they don’t bring us inner happi- ness. It is at the point where we realize this dilemma that we begin to open up to a spiritual path. We realize that there simply has to be something more to life, and we begin to search for it.

That is, we come back into an experi- ence of our spiritual essence, the universal energy within us all. Through this experience we can be restored to our spiri- tual power, and the emptiness inside us is filled up from within. Now to get back to our supposed paradox. When we are coming out of the empty, grasping, manip- ulative condition, the first and foremost lesson to be learned is just to let go . We must relax, stop struggling, stop trying so hard, stop manipulating things and people to try to get what we want and need, in fact stop doing so much and have an experience of just being for a while. When we do this, we suddenly discover that we’re really perfectly okay, in fact we feel quite wonderful, just letting ourselves be, and letting the world be, without trying to change things. This is the basic experience of being here now and it’s what the Buddhist philosophy means by “letting go of attachment.” It’s similar to the Christian concept, “God’s will be done.” It’s a very freeing experience, and a most basic one on any path of self-awareness.

You begin to want to focus your energy toward the highest and most fulfilling goals that are real for you at any given moment. You realize that life can be basically good, abun- dant, and often fun, and that having what you truly want, without struggle and strain, is part of your natural birthright as a function of just being alive. This is the time when cre- ative visualization can become a most important tool. Here is a metaphor that I hope will make it even clearer: Let us imagine that life is a river. Most people are clinging to the bank, afraid to let go and risk being carried along by the current of the river. At a certain point, each person must be willing to simply let go, and trust the river to carry him along safely. At this point, he learns to “go with the flow” and it feels wonderful. Once he has become accustomed to being in the flow of the river, he can begin to look ahead and guide his own course onward, deciding where the course looks best, steering the way around boulders and snags, and choosing which of the many channels and branches of the river he prefers to follow, all the while still “going with the flow.” A Spiritual “Paradox” 41 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-One 1/23/01 5:44 PM Page 41"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"This metaphor shows us how we can accept our lives here and now, flowing with what is, and at the same time guiding ourselves consciously toward our goals by taking responsibility for creating our own lives.

The most important thing to remember is to use creative visualization often, to make it a regular part of your life. Most people seem to find that it works best to practice it at least a little every day, especially when they are first learning.

Try it out in different situations and under different cir- cumstances, and use it as often as you can for any type of problem-solving. If you find yourself worried or puzzled about anything, or feeling discouraged or frustrated about a problem, ask yourself if there is a way you could use creative visualization to help you.

The more you believe in your chosen goal and the possibility of attaining it, the more certain you will be to do so. Ask yourself, “Do I believe that this goal can exist?” and “Do I believe that it is possible for me to realize or attain it?” 3. Acceptance.

The clearer and stronger your intention, the more quick- ly and easily your creative visualization will work. In any given situation, ask yourself about the condition of your intention. If it is weak or uncertain, look more deeply to see what your doubts, fears, conflicts, or concerns may be.

The river of life sometimes takes a winding course toward your goal. It may even seem temporarily to be going in a different direc- tion entirely, yet in the long run it is a more effortless and harmonious way to get there than through struggling and striving. Going with the flow means holding onto your goals lightly (even though they may seem very important) and being willing to change them if something more appropri- ate and satisfying comes along.

To create prosperity, we need to visualize ourselves living as we desire to live, doing what we love, feeling satisfied with what we attain, in a context of other people doing the same.

Once we begin to learn to accept the goodness of the universe, we naturally want to share it as well, realizing that as we give out of our energy, we make space for more to flow into us. When, through insecurity (fear) and a feeling that there “isn’t enough,” we try to hold onto or cling to what we have, we begin to cut off this wonderful flow of energy.

Energy takes many forms, such as love, affection, ap- preciation and recognition, material possessions, money, and friendship. The principles apply equally to all these forms. If you look around you at those who are most unhappy, you’ll often find that they are people who have a “starved” feeling in some way, and are therefore taking a very grasping posture toward life. They feel that life in general and other people in particular are not giving them what they need. It is as if they have a stranglehold on life, trying desperately to wring out the love and satisfaction they crave, yet actually choking off the supply. And many of us have a little of this tendency. When we find that place within ourselves that is giving, we begin to reverse the flow. True giving happens not from a space of sacrifice, or self-righteousness, or an idea of spiritu- ality, but for the pure pleasure of it — because it’s fun. It can only come from a full, loving place. We each have an infinite supply of love and happiness within us. We have been accustomed to thinking that we have to get something from outside of us in order to be happy, but in truth it works the other way: We must learn to contact our inner source of happiness and satisfaction and flow it out- ward to share with others — not because it is virtuous to do so, but because it feels really good!

(Nature abhors a vacuum, so as you outflow you create space into which something must flow.) Giving becomes its own reward.

Choose something that makes you feel especially good too, even if it’s a little more difficult for you. Practice speaking more words of thanks, appreciation, and admiration to people when you feel like it. “It was kind of you to help me.” “I want you to know that I appreciate that.” “Your eyes were shining and beautiful as you said that, and it made me feel good to see you.” (It’s okay to say these things even if you feel a little embarrassed!) 2. Go through your personal possessions and find items you don’t really want or don’t use very often and give them to others who will appreciate them more. 3. If you’re a person who tries to spend as little money as possible and always hunts for a bargain, try spending a little money each day unnecessarily. Buy the product that costs a few cents more instead of less, treat yourself to a little something extra, pay for a friend’s coffee, or donate money to a good cause.

One of the basic principles of holistic health is that we cannot separate our physical health from our emotional, mental, and spiritual states of being. All levels are intercon- nected and a state of “dis-ease” in the body is always a reflec- tion of conflict, tension, anxiety, or disharmony on other levels of being as well. So when we have a physical disorder, it is inevitably a message for us to look deeply into our emo- tional and intuitive feelings, our thoughts and attitudes, to see what we can do to restore natural harmony and balance to our beings. We must tune in and “listen” to the inner process. There is constant communication between mind and body.

So the whole process is closely tied in with our deepest concepts and ideas about ourselves, life, and the nature of disease and health. Creative visualization refers to the way in which we com- municate from our minds to our bodies. It is the process of forming images and thoughts in our minds, consciously or unconsciously, and then transmitting them to our bodies as signals or commands. Conscious creative visualization is the process of creating positive thoughts and images to communicate with our bod- ies, in place of negative, constrictive, literally “sickening” ones.

Often the message of illness is to be quieter and spend some time just being in contact with our inner selves. Illness often forces us to relax, let go of all our busyness and “effort- ing,” and drop into a deep, quiet level of consciousness where we can receive the nourishing energy that we need. The fundamental healing always comes from within, even though we may also require external treatment. When we allow ourselves quietness and inner contact regularly, we may no longer need to get sick in order for our inner selves to get our attention.

If attempts to heal seem ineffective, there may come a time to focus on visualizing a peaceful, satisfying completion of life and embracing of death.

There is a part of our consciousness that is directly linked with that part in everyone else’s consciousness.

I was brought up with a very scientific and rational back- ground and education, and the ability to heal other people at a distance has been one of the hardest things for me to understand and accept. Yet I have seen it and experienced it too often to doubt it any longer. And there are interesting scientific studies that confirm the healing power of prayer and visualization.* In my experience, I’ve found that the best way to work on healing is to picture myself as a clear channel for healing energy, and envision the spiritual energy of the universe flow- ing through me to the person who needs it. I think of my higher self sending energy to the other person’s higher self to support them in whatever they need to do to heal them- selves, keeping in mind that it’s okay if the person chooses not to get well. At the same time, I picture the person as he or she truly is . . . a divine being, a beautiful and perfect expression of God . . . naturally healthy and happy.

For example, “I, Shakti, am deeply relaxed and centered in myself.” “Shakti, you are deeply relaxed and cen- tered in yourself.” “Shakti is deeply relaxed and centered in herself.” Or you can record a little speech, maybe three or four paragraphs long, describing your ideal visualization of your- self or a particular situation, as if it were already true.

Good places are: on the refrigerator, on your phone, on your mirror, on your desk, over your bed, or on your dining table. With Others 1. If you have a friend who wants to work on affirma- tions as well, you can do them very effectively with a part- ner. Sit facing each other, look into each other’s eyes, and take turns saying affirmations to each other and accepting them. David: “Linda, you are a beautiful, loving, and creative person.” Linda: “Yes, I know!” or “Yes, I am!” Repeat this ten or fifteen times the same way, then switch partners so that Linda says the affirmation to David and he agrees with it. Then try it in the first person: David: “I, David, am a beautiful, loving, and creative per- son.” Linda: “Yes, you certainly are.” Repeat several times. 114 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization-Three 1/23/01 5:40 PM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Be sure to say the affirmations sincerely and meaning- fully, even if you feel a little silly at first.

In a more informal way, ask your friends to say affir- mations to you frequently. For example, if you want to affirm that you are learning to express yourself more easily, you might ask a good friend to say to you often, “Jeannie, you are certainly speaking out and expressing yourself clearly these days!” Make a game out of doing this for each other and you will find it helpful. We automatically tend to give a lot of power to what our friends say to us, for good or bad; our minds tend to accept what others tell us about ourselves. So getting strong positive feedback from friends in the form of affirmations really works. 3. Begin to include affirmations in your conversations — making strong positive statements about things and people (including yourself) that you want to see in a more positive way.

Do not use it when you are feeling upset or strongly negative or it will feel like you are repressing yourself.

Make a point of learning songs that affirm the reality you would like to create for yourself; listen to them and sing them often. A large part of our present consciousness has been formed by popular music, which creates a reality in which we feel hopelessly dependent on our lovers, would die if they left us, wonder if life is worth living if we can’t “have” a certain person, and so on. 2.

A “block” is a place where energy is constricted — not moving, not flowing. Usually blocks are caused initially by repressed emotions of fear, sadness, guilt, self-criticism, and/or resentment (anger), which cause a person to tighten up and close down spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and even physically. In dealing with a block on any level, what’s needed is to get energy moving and flowing in that area. The keys to this are: 1. Mental and emotional acceptance of what you are feeling (on a physical level this manifests as relaxation and release).

Clear observation, which leads to an understanding of the root of the problem — which is often a limiting atti- tude or belief. So in dealing with an area of consciousness where we have a block, we need to first experience (as fully as possible) the emotion we have locked up in that area, in a loving, accepting way. In doing so, we get the blocked-up energy moving and we have a chance to observe the underlying neg- ative beliefs or attitudes which caused the problem to begin with. We can take a good, clear look at them and let them dissolve themselves. Amazingly enough, it seems to be the process of pin- pointing the constrictive belief and accepting the feelings you have around it which works magic; the difficulty almost inevitably dissolves and disappears eventually once you’ve understood and accepted yourself. It’s much simpler than you may think. The trick is to simultaneously love and accept yourself compassionately for having this belief, and at the same time see clearly that you are ready to let go of it because it is limit- ing, destructive, self-defeating, and untrue.

Depressing though they may seem when you read through them all at once, the fact is that every one of us has bought into some of these (or other) negative viewpoints about reality, at least to some degree. And it’s no wonder that we have incorporated these ideas into our sense of reality — they are all extremely preva- lent in our world at this time in our evolution. In fact, the world is currently being run according to these ideas, although fortunately this is rapidly changing. The important thing to realize is that they are only beliefs ; they have no objective truth. Although they may seem to be true at times when we look around us, that is only because so many human beings believe them and act accord- ingly.

Go your own way and be happy.” When you have finished this process, write on your paper “I now forgive you and release you all” and throw it away, as a symbol that you are letting go of these past experiences. Many people find that this process of forgiveness and release is miraculous in relieving them immediately of their long-standing burdens of accumulated resentment and hos- tility. The wonderful thing is that the other people involved, even if you never see them again, will on a psychic level pick up your forgiveness and it will help to clear up their lives as well. It may be that the first time you do this process you will not have an experience of relief and release with certain peo- ple (especially a parent, spouse, or other very significant per- son in your life). If there is a strong emotional charge or a lot of deep feeling, it may be necessary to talk to a therapist or counselor, or find a safe place to fully express your anger and hurt.

It is a combination of writing affirma- tions and a clearing process, neatly rolled into one. I love it because it is so simple and easy to do, yet it gets down to a very deep level. Writing affirmations is a very dynamic technique because the written word has so much power over our minds. We are both writing and reading them at the same time, so it’s like a double hit of energy. Take any affirmation you want to work with and write it ten or twenty times in succession on a piece of paper. Use your name, and try writing it in the first, second, and third persons. (For example: I, John, am a successful singer and songwriter. Writing Affirmations 135 Creative Visualization/4&5 1/23/01 6:15 PM Page 135"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"John, you are a successful singer and songwriter. John is a suc- cessful singer and songwriter.) Don’t just write it by rote; really think about the meaning of the words as you are writing them. Notice whether you feel any resistance, doubts, or negative thoughts about what you are writing. Whenever you do (even a slight one) turn the paper over, and on the back write out the negative thought, the reason why the affirmation can’t be true, can’t work, or what- ever. (For example: I’m really not good enough. I’m too old. This isn’t going to work.) Then go back to writing the affirma- tion. When you are finished, take a look at the back of the paper. If you have been honest, you will have a good look at the reasons why you keep yourself from having what you want in this particular case. With this in mind, think of some affirmations you can do to help you specifically counteract these negative fears or beliefs, and begin to write out these new affirmations. For example, if one of your negative beliefs is, “I can’t be more suc- cessful than my father was,” you could affirm, “My father is proud and happy about my success.” Or you may want to stick with the original affirmation if it seems effective, or modify it slightly to be more accurate.

I often find it helpful to do some exercises with pen and paper, which I share with you here. When you are working on setting goals it’s important to keep a few things in mind. Remember that setting goals does not mean that you are stuck with those goals. You can change them as often as you want to and feel that it’s necessary. Remember also that setting goals does not mean that you have to pursue them through effort, striving, or strug- gling. It does not mean that you have to become emotional- ly addicted to achieving them. On the contrary, setting goals can help you flow through life more easily, effortlessly, and pleasurably. The nature of life is movement and creativity, and goals give you a clear focus and direction in which to Setting Goals 139 \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization/4&5 1/23/01 6:15 PM Page 139"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"channel your natural creative energy, thereby helping you to outflow and contribute to the world, which enhances your feeling of well-being and satisfaction in life. Goals are there to help you and support you in your true purpose. Goals can be made in the spirit that life is an enjoyable game to be played, and one that can be deeply rewarding. They are not to be taken too heavily or seriously. At the same time, you must give them enough weight and importance so they are of real value to you. You may find that the very process of choosing goals brings up a certain amount of emotional resistance in you. You might experience this in various different ways, such as feeling depressed, hopeless, or overwhelmed at the thought of trying to set goals. Or you might feel the desire to distract yourself by eating, sleeping, or other activities. These emo- tional reactions (if you should have them) are clues to the ways in which you avoid getting what you want in life. It’s important to go ahead and experience these feelings and reactions, to go through them, and proceed with the process. Once you get into it you will find it of value. Then again, you may thoroughly enjoy the whole process and find it very expansive, fun, and enlightening. I hope so! Don’t make the choosing of goals too complicated or sig- nificant. Start with simple, obvious things. Remember you can always change and develop them as you go along. 140 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization/4&5 1/23/01 6:15 PM Page 140"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Exercises 1.

Don’t think too hard about it; simply write down any ideas that come to your mind as good possibilities.

You can be as creative as you like with this category, and you may find that you have all kinds of interesting ideas you never thought of before. Now reread the whole thing and meditate on it awhile.

I now support myself easily and abundantly through leading seminars and giving speeches to enthusiastic and appreciative audiences. In writing your goals, be sure to put down things that are real and meaningful to you, things that you actually want, not what you think you should want. No one else need ever see your goals unless you want him or her to, and this process requires that you be totally honest with yourself. 5. Repeat the process above with your goals for one year. Don’t make too many; if you have a lot at first, eliminate all but the five or six most important ones. Check to see that they are in alignment with your five-year goals. That is, make sure they are moving in the same general direction so that when you accomplish your one-year goals, you will be a step closer to your five-year goals.

The more long-range your goal, the more expansive and imaginative you can be, so that your horizons are constantly extended. 2. When you find that you have not accomplished some of your goals (which will inevitably happen), do not criticize yourself or assume that you have failed. Simply acknowledge clearly to yourself that you have not accomplished that goal, and decide whether or not it is still a goal for you; that is, decide whether you want to set it again for yourself, or whether you want to let it go. It is most important that you acknowledge unaccomplished goals in this way. Otherwise, they may accumulate in the back of your mind and you will feel unconsciously that you have “failed,” which will eventu- ally make you tend to avoid the goal-setting process. 3.

This process is ultimately to help you enjoy your life more. If you set a lot of goals that you don’t accomplish you are probably either setting them unrealistically high, or setting goals that you don’t truly desire and therefore have no real inner intention of pursuing. Choose goals that you genuine- ly like and want, and are realistic for you. Your goals should make you feel good — uplifted, expanded, full of pleasure, challenged.

You can make a treasure map by drawing or painting it, or by making a collage using pictures and words cut from magazines, books or cards, photographs, lettering, drawings, and so on.

Create a treasure map for a single goal or area of your life, so that you can be sure to include all the elements with- out getting too complicated. This enables the mind to focus on it more clearly and easily than if you include all your goals on one treasure map. You might want to do one treasure map for your relationships, one for your job, one for your spiritu- al growth, and so on. 2. You can make it any size that’s convenient for you. You may want to keep it in your notebook, hang it on your wall, or carry it in your pocket or purse. I usually make mine on light cardboard, which holds up better than paper. 3. Be sure to put yourself in the picture. For a very real- istic effect, use a photograph of yourself. Otherwise draw yourself in. Show yourself being, doing, or having your desired objective — traveling around the world, wearing your new clothes, or being the proud author of your new book. 4. Show the situation in its ideal, complete form, as if it already exists. You don’t need to indicate how it’s going to come about. This is the finished product. Don’t show any- thing negative or undesirable. 5. Use lots of color in your treasure map to increase the power and impact on your consciousness. 6.

Include some symbol of the infinite which has mean- ing and power for you. It could be an “om” sign, a cross, Christ, Buddha, a sun radiating light, or anything that represents universal intelligence or God. This is an acknowledgment and a reminder that everything comes from the infinite source. 8. Put affirmations on your treasure map. “Here I am driving my new red truck with a camper top. I love it, and I have plenty of money to maintain it.” Be sure to also include the cosmic affirmation, “This, or something better, now manifests for me in totally satisfying and harmonious ways, for the highest good of all concerned.” The process of creating your treasure map is a powerful step toward manifesting your goal. Now just spend a few minutes each day quietly looking at it, and every once in a while throughout the day give it a thought. That is all that’s necessary.

We are afraid the food we eat is going to make us fat, or make us sick (unhealthy). Yet we tend to compulsively con- tinue eating the very foods we fear, thus creating inner stress and conflict, and eventually creating the feared effects — overweight and illness. Also, many people are very unconscious while they eat. We are so busy talking and thinking of other things, we fail to tune in to the delicious, satisfying taste and nutrition of our food. Eating is really a magic ritual, an amazing process in which various forms of energy from the universe are trans- formed into the energy that forms our bodies.

Open your eyes and look at the food; really observe what it looks like. Observe how it smells. Slowly begin to eat it; really be aware of and enjoy the taste. As you are eating, talk to your- self silently in your mind, and tell yourself that this food is being transformed into life energy for your use. Tell yourself that your body is using everything that it needs, and easily eliminating anything that it doesn’t need. Picture yourself becoming healthier and more beautiful as a result of eating the food. Do this regardless of any other previous concepts you may have of how good or bad the food is for you.

Each person’s energy tends to support the others, and in this case the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts. No matter what the group you are involved in, whether it is your family or a group of friends, a work group, a social action group, a church or spiritual group, or a workshop or class, you may find that creative visualization provides you with tools for achieving your group’s goals, or just for tuning into each other in a deeper way.

Music is very powerful in effecting change. Meditating and Imaging Choose a goal or image, and have everyone sit in silent meditation, visualizing and affirming it together. You may be amazed at the results. Treasure Mapping Have each person create his or her own treasure map for a group goal, or as a group create one treasure map together. Or you can even appoint a committee to make a treasure map! Affirmations Do affirmations in partners, as I describe in the section on how to use affirmations. Or have the whole group speak affirmations aloud together. Healing Healing in groups is a wonderful experience.

Because human beings are so sensitive to each other on so many levels, we are especially susceptible and receptive to the thought forms that we hold about each other. It is these thought forms and the underlying attitudes that they reflect which form our relationships, and cause them to work or not work. In a relationship, as in everything else, we get exactly what we believe in, expect, and “ask for” on our deepest lev- els. The people we are in relationships with are always a mir- ror, reflecting our own beliefs, and simultaneously we are mirrors, reflecting their beliefs. A relationship with another human being is one of the most powerful tools for growth that we have; if we look honestly at our relationships we can see so much about how we have created them.

Assume for a moment that you alone are responsi- ble for creating it the way it is, no matter how much it may look to you like the other person is responsible for certain things. If there are certain things about the relationship that are unsatisfying to you, ask yourself why and how you have created it that way. Keep in mind, however, that taking responsibility for your life does not mean that you are to blame for the problems in your life or relationship.* See if you can discover what core beliefs you have that cause you to create a less than satisfying, happy, loving relationship. What is the payoff for you in keeping yourself in an unhap- py space? (There is always a payoff in everything we do; oth- erwise we wouldn’t do it.) If you truly desire to have deeply fulfilling, happy rela- tionships in your life, if you believe that it is possible for you to have them, and if you are willing to accept that happiness and satisfaction, then you can and will create relationships that work for you. Here are some things you can do to help you with your relationships: 1. Look at your goals in the relationship. What do you truly want out of this relationship? Consider all levels — 162 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 *For clarification about the difference between responsibility and self-blame, read my book, The Path of Transformation .

Write out an ideal scene, or do a treasure map that expresses your perfect visualization in this relationship. 2. Take a good honest look at what beliefs and attitudes are keeping you from creating what you want. You can use a clearing process to help you get in touch with your limiting attitudes. For example, you can write, “The reason I can’t have a satisfying relationship with _______ is . . .” or “The reason I can’t have what I want in this relationship is ....” Then write all the responses that come up for you. 3. Use affirmations and visual imagery to change your negative beliefs, and to start visualizing and creating loving, fulfilling relationships. 4. Use visualization to improve a difficult relationship. Let us say, for example, that you have difficulty getting along with someone and you would like to create a more harmo- nious relationship with that person: After relaxing into a deep, quiet, meditative state of mind, imagine the two of you relating and communicating in an open, honest, and effective way. Imagine saying to this person anything you need to communicate in order to clear things up between you. Imagine the person listening and hearing you, then saying anything he or she needs to say, with you listening in return.

If you are sincere in your desire and intention, and truly open to change, you may soon find that the relationship is becoming easier and more flowing, and that the other person seems to become more agreeable and easier to communicate with. Eventually you may find that the problem will resolve itself completely, in one way or another, to the benefit of all parties concerned. This resolution may involve an actual communication with the person, or it may not. 5. The technique of saying affirmations to each other can often help to improve relationships dramatically. Of course it’s very important to communicate with each other honestly from your true feelings about what you like and don’t like, and what you want. But instead of continuously complaining about each other’s shortcomings and weakness- es, try making an agreement to affirm to each other that you are improving and making progress in your growth and development. So instead of, “George, why do you always interrupt me when I’m saying something?” you might agree to say to George at appropriate moments, “I appreciate the way you are becoming a good listener.” In this way you not only remind George in a friendly way to be a better listener, but you also begin to change your image of George, as well as George’s image of himself. 164 C REATIVE V ISUALIZATION \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002 Creative Visualization/4&5 1/23/01 6:15 PM Page 164"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"In ongoing relationships, all too often we have gotten stuck in certain roles and images with each other which we find difficult to change. It’s as if we’ve put ourselves and each other in a certain box with certain labels on it. We find this very limiting and confining, but don’t always know how to step out of it. Creative visualization provides us with a wonderful tool for expanding out of our roles and stereotypes. Begin to visu- alize and affirm new images for yourself and for the other person, see the potential for positive change within every person and every situation, and give energy and support to that positive change through creative visualization. Remember, however, that human relationships are very complex. Our relationships perfectly reflect our own inner process; they are wonderfully effective mirrors to help us see the next step of our own growth. So if relationship difficul- ties persist, it is a message to us that a deeper level of our own healing is needed. I strongly recommend getting sup- port from a good therapist or counselor who can help us see what the problems in our relationship are trying to teach us.

We all have a great deal to offer the world and to each other, each in our own special and unique way. To a great degree, our own personal sense of well-being is a function of how much we are express- ing this. We each have a significant contribution to make in this lifetime. It may involve many things, or it may be something very simple. I call this contribution our higher purpose. It always involves being yourself totally, completely, and natu- rally, and doing something or many things that you genuine- ly love to do, and that you have a natural gift for.

In fact, most people seem to go to great lengths to hide it from themselves and from the world. They fear and seek to avoid the power, responsibility, and light that comes with acknowledging and expressing their true purpose in life. As you use creative visualization, you will find that you become more and more attuned to and aware of your higher purpose. Notice the elements that tend to recur in your dreams, goals, and fantasies, the particular qualities that are there in the things you find yourself doing and creating. These are important clues to the underlying meaning and purpose of your life. In using creative visualization, you will find that your ability to manifest will work to the degree that you are in alignment with your higher purpose. If you try to manifest something and it doesn’t seem to work, it may not be appro- priate to the underlying pattern and meaning of your life. Be patient and keep tuning into your inner guidance. In retro- spect, you will see that everything is unfolding perfectly. This is a time of great transformation on our planet.
