"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\u0015 '\\DG%DVLFV DYAD BASICS This paper briefly summarizes the important basic technical details of the dyad format used for clearing the mind and increasing one’s ability to communicate. This paper describes the clearing dyad. The Enlightenment Intensive dyad is somewhat different and is covered in detail elsewhere. Basic Setup • Two individuals are seated a comfortable distance apart and at the same height. • One individual is the receptive partner. The other individual is the active partner. • The partners reverse roles (active and receptive) after each completed cycle . This is often called “changing-over”. • A cycle may be a fixed interval of time, typically 5 minutes, or after one complete compliance with a dyad instruction. This latter form is called “cycle change-overs”. (The compliance is described in detail below.) If the 5-minute interval is used, a monitor calls out, “Thank your partner. Change over,” at the end of each 5-minute period. • A dyad period lasts 40 minutes and ends with a bell or gong. A monitor says “Thank you.” at the end. Active partners should finish up their current cycles quickly after a bell. Receptive partner ’s role • Gives an instruction to the active partner. (Many possible instructions are given in the “Dyad Instruction List”, later in this document.) • Keeps attention on the active partner. • Listens to what the other says. • Understands what the other says. • Acknowledges when the communication cycle is complete. Active partner ’s role • Receives the instruction from the receptive partner. • Generally does something “internally” to comply with the instruction. • Communicates a response to the receptive partner. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"'\\DG%DVLFV \u0016  Instruction (1) Compliance (2) Response (3) Receptive Partner Active Partner Dyad Cycle Summary • Receptive partner gets the instruction clear in his own mind. • Receptive partner puts his attention on the active partner. • Receptive partner communicates the instruction clearly and directly to the active partner. (1) • Receptive partner keeps his attention on the active partner and is open to a response. • Active partner listens to receptive partner and receives the instruction. • Active partner complies with the instruction to the best of his ability. (2) • Active partner communicates his compliance to the receptive partner. (3) • Receptive partner listens to, receives, and understands the active partner’s communication. • Receptive partner acknowledges the compliance by saying “thank you”, “OK”, or some equivalent phrase. • Partners reverse roles."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\u0017 '\\DG%DVLFV Perfecting the Technique • The receptive partner should not change the wording of the instruction, give it sloppily, or put his own emotional content on the instruction to lead the active partner. The instruction is given clearly and cleanly. • The receptive partner should not use facial expressions, nods, body language, “vibes”, or any other means to express an opinion or evaluation of what the active partner says. • With cycle change-overs, never change over (reverse roles) until an understanding is reached. • Whenever either partner doesn’t know what to do next, he or she raises a hand to get help from a monitor. • If the active partner doesn’t understand what he or she is being asked to do or what the purpose of the instruction is, he or she should raise his hand for help from a monitor. The dyad should not continue while there is confusion about what the active partner is to do to comply with an instruction. • If the receptive partner can’t remain neutral about what the active partner says, he or she should raise a hand for help from a monitor. The Communication Cycle—The Ideal Form • You have a thought . • You intend that another duplicate that same thought in their consciousness from you . • You do whatever it takes to get the thought across. • The other duplicates the thought. He gets that thought, nothing added on and nothing left off . • The other acknowledges that he got your thought, from you . (A simple “OK”, “thank you”, “got it”, or the equivalent will do.) Note that it may not be possible to get a communication across. It depends on the receiver as well as the sender. There are just a few alternatives: • Wait until the other is ready—could be forever • Drop it entirely • Find a prior communication that, if told to him first, would enable him to get your main message. There may be more than one prior message required. One must be able to tolerate not getting a communication across to another."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'\\DG%DVLFV \u0018 • When the receptive partner does not understand what the active partner said, he or she can say, ⇒ “Clarify that.”, or “Clarify the part about <...>.” ⇒ “Give me that again.” ⇒ “Say that again, louder.” ⇒ “Summarize your answer.” • The receptive partner must not use the queries (listed above) to convey an opinion about what the active partner said or about what his or her own response to the instruction would be. (The receptive partner shouldn’t be doing the instruction along with the active partner. The receptive partner remains receptive.) • The active partner can say, “Give me the instruction again” to help him or her refocus on the instruction. This is done within an existing communication cycle—it doesn’t mean that they are starting a new cycle. • If the receptive partner is: – Certain that he or she is in no way caught up with the active partner’s process, and – Certain that he or she can interact with the active partner without contaminating the active partner’s process with his or her own mental material, he may make up an appropriate query to help arrive quickly at an understanding of what the active partner said. He should keep such queries simple and to the point. Key information about the clearing instruction and its compliance • It is an instruction directed to the active partner, not a question. It’s not “What is help?”; it is “(You) Tell me what help is”. The instruction should be delivered with the expectation of a compliance . The difference between giving an instruction and asking a question is that an instruction is directed toward the individual. A question tends to go directly to the mind, bypassing the individual. • The instruction is something the active partner can do . If the active partner does not understand what to do, or just can’t do it for whatever reason, it is not a valid instruction for him or her. The active partner must grasp the meaning of the instruction. If not, he or she will either go silent or respond with something other than what is intended. • The instruction must be clear to the receptive partner as well. Just saying the words will not work because the receptive partner will not know if the active partner complied or not and this will communicate some of the receptive partner’s confusion to the active partner. The receptive partner must know exactly what he or she wants the active partner to do. Don’t begin a dyad until both partners understand the intent of the instruction. Get help from a monitor if either loses this conviction. • The receptive partner has the responsibility for getting the instruction across to the active partner, and for deciding that the cycle is complete when it has been complied with. Of course the active partner must also be satisfied that he or she complied with the instruction. The receptive partner is “in charge”. ( No authoritarian role is implied however.)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\u0019 '\\DG%DVLFV • The instruction is something from the receptive partner , not from a sheet of paper or part of the receptive partner’s memory storage in his brain. It is a live inquiry. • Give the instruction each time as if it were the first time—fresh. It is not connected with a previous cycle nor does it anticipate a later cycle. • The active partner does the instruction. The receptive partner does none of it. • The active partner’s response should be due to the fact that he or she has understood what it is the receptive partner wants. • The active partner’s response must in some way comply with the instruction. Otherwise it is a “non-compliance”. It is the responsibility of the receptive partner to make sure there actually was a compliance. (With the enlightenment questions, there is an agreement to say what comes up as a result of contemplation. Although this might not sound like a compliance to the instruction, it is accepted. But in a clearing communication cycle, there must be a compliance to the instruction.) • Fixing up what seems to be a non-compliance to the receptive partner takes some tact. The receptive partner says, “Tell me how that complied with the instruction.” in a non-blaming way. Don’t change over until both are satisfied that an understanding occurred. Ask a monitor to help if it starts to get complicated. • The active partner is never wrong (i.e. bad) for not complying with the instruction. Just correct the non-understanding and proceed. Get help from a monitor if necessary. • The receptive partner should have the active partner continue explaining about his compliance until the receptive partner is sure he, the receptive partner, understands. • If the active partner says, “I said some things but I don’t know if I complied with the instruction,” the receptive partner accepts that, acknowledges, and gives the instruction again. • The receptive partner doesn’t have to agree with the active partner’s communication. He or she just has to understand it. The receptive partner must see that it is a valid response in the active partner’s est imation and can understand how it is a compliance. • There is no right answer to the instruction. There is only the receptive partner’s understanding of how the active partner sees that the response is a compliance and how the active partner sees that it is a compliance. • If the receptive partner has a lot of unconscious confusion or charge in his or her own mind or emotions in the area that the instruction addresses, he or she will have more trouble understanding the active partner’s responses. This will slow down the process, but it can still work.

Just reading the instructions can be a powerful experience. Confusion Clearing The format has two steps: “Tell me what <...> is”, alternated with “Tell me what <...> isn’t”. Use the following concepts: • Improvement • Help • Responsibility • Conflict • Contact • Communication • Understanding • Ability • Difference • Origin • Power • Choice • Enlightenment • God • Death You can also choose any other concept that you want to clear up. The goal is to split off other concepts that are attached to the concept you are trying to clear. Separating similar concepts that are connected in the mind eliminates confusion. Janus Process This process is very powerful. It can dramatically increase one’s awareness of interpersonal relationships. • Tell me something you want to tell me. • Tell me how communicating that changed our relationship Use 5-minute cycles. Acknowledge and repeat the second line after each response until the end of the 5-minute period. Compulsion Clearing Compulsions make it seem like you have no freedom. Compulsions are a false solution to problems in relationship with others who seem powerful. • Tell me what you think you have to be responsible for. Tell me what you think you don’t have to be responsible for. • Tell me a decision you could make. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\u001b '\\DG%DVLFV • Tell me something that is not true.
