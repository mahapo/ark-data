While most adults and children have the capacity for phenomenal memory, few ever know the simple secrets of harnessing this amazing ability. Learning the techniques in MEMORY LANGUAGE and practis- ing often is the key to powerful memory recall. This book is written in a simple, easy-to-read style and the cartoon format and humorous stories will enable everyone to learn while being amused and entertained. It will teach both children and adults the valuable skill of imagery. You should be able to master the basic technique in less than an hour—the average adult reader can do it in 48 minutes! AT THE END OF THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE AMAZED AT THE RECALL ABILITY THAT YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN HAVE DEVELOPED. To get the best out of this book follow these simple guidelines: • It is important that each reader knows the nursery rhyme song in the book. If you don't know it, turn to page 35 and practise it before you begin the story. • The story is about two children who are asked to take a trip to the shops and remember a list often items. In reality, you would not ask young children to remember such a large list and the average adult would have difficulty remembering half this number of items. But in this book it is an essential part of the story to teach the lessons. • We will be asking the readers to clearly visualise a number of images known as Memory Pegs. Each person may imagine a different vii"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"version of them. For example, if you ask eight-year-olds to visualise a shoe one child may think of a ballet shoe, another might see a football boot and an adult could picture a sneaker. It is important to let each reader have his or her own version of the Memory Peg because personalisation makes recall easier. • This is a participation book so get everyone involved. When the children in the story begin to visualise their Grandfather's instructions, stop the story and you and your children do the same exercise. Study each illustration and ask everyone to comment on it. Then ask them to recall the item they think belongs to that page. And when you've all mastered the skills, let the kids use the book as a colouring book. Most of all, have a good time.

After school Adam and Jasmine had to walk all the way home. The school bus was at the beach with the class. They didn't even want to go out and play.

Then go to the supermarket and buy 5. a custard pie for dessert and 6. a dozen eggs. On the way home, pick up our 7. holiday photos from the chemist and then get the 8. chocolate cake that Mrs Suter has baked for us.

MEMORY PEGS and SILLY STORIES.\" The children looked blankly at him. What did he mean? \"First you learn ten memory pegs,\" said Grandpa. \"What's that?\" asked Adam. \"Pegs are places to hang things,\" said Grandpa. \"You mean like the pegs at school where we hang our school bags?\" Jasmine asked. \"That's right,\" Grandpa replied. 32 33"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"\"Do you know the song that goes like this...

For number TWO imagine your favourite SHOE. At THREE imagine a TREE that you've seen and for number FOUR imagine a bedroom DOOR. At FIVE, which is HIVE, imagine a hive full of bees. For SIX imagine some STICKS from a tree. At number SEVEN, which is HEAVEN, imagine an angel floating in the clouds and at EIGHT picture a GATE that you've seen. For NINE, which is LINE, see a white line down the middle of the road and finally, at TEN, imagine a big fat HEN!\" \"Are you ready to imagine each of those pegs?\" he asked. \"We're ready!\" they shouted happily. So they closed their eyes and began to think of what their memory pegs would look like. 38 39"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"\"Now let's go through the list of things that your Mother asked you to do,\" said Grandpa. \"Item number one on your list is feed the cat.\" \"Adam, what's the memory peg for one?\" asked Grandpa. \"One is Drum,\" replied Adam. \"Right, so at number one let's imagine that your cat Cosmo is walking down the street early in the mom- ing and he's got a drum full of cat food on his back. There's a tap coming out of the drum and he's eating his breakfast from it! And he's banging the drum with his tail and waking up all the neighbours.\" \"That's silly!\" giggled Adam. \"Yes, and the sillier we make it, the easier it is to remember!\" Grandpa said. \"So one is DRUM—FEED THE CAT \" 40 41"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"\"Number two on the list is pick up your toys,\" said Grandpa. \"What's the peg for two, Jasmine?\" \"Two is Shoe, Grandpa.\" \"Right, Jasmine. Now think of a silly story about your shoe and your toys,\" said Grandpa. \"OK,\" said Jasmine. \"Imagine that my toys are driv- ing around in my shoe and I'm running after them and chasing them into the toybox.\" \"Now that's really silly, Grandpa,\" Adam laughed. \"Exactly, Adam, and silliness is a very important part of remembering things,\" said Grandpa. \"Remember, the sillier the better.\" Two is SHOE—PICK UP YOUR TOYS.\" 42 43"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"\"Now, what is the memory peg for number three?\" Grandpa asked. \"I know, Grandpa, Three is Tree,\" said Adam. Grandpa smiled and said, \"Right. And the third item on the list is ice-cream cones. Think of a silly story about ice-cream and a tree, Adam.\" Adam thought for a moment then said, \"Imagine that my cat Cosmo and I are sitting under a tree that grows ice-cream and there's ice-cream cones falling all over us. It's all running down my face and Cosmo and I eat it until we nearly burst! Yum yum.\" \"And you said my stories were silly,\" Jasmine laughed. \"So Three is TREE—ICE-CREAM CONES.\" 44 45"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"\"This is fun,\" said Adam. \"What are the next two items on the list?\" asked Grandpa. \"A big tomato and a custard pie,\" replied Jasmine. \"Jasmine, you peg the tomato at number four and Adam, you peg the custard pie at number five,\" said Grandpa. So Jasmine closed her eyes, grinned cheekily and said, \"Four is Door. I'm pretending that I open my bed- room door but the handle has changed into a big tomato and it squashes between my fingers and goes all over the carpet.\" \"Let's make it even sillier,\" chuckled Grandpa. \"The tomato juice runs down the stairs and all over your Dad's head!\" \"Boy, he'd be mad!\" laughed Adam. \"Four is DOOR—A BIG TOMATO.\" 46 47"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"\"The memory peg for Five is Hive and the item is a custard pie,\" said Grandpa. \"What can you do with that, Adam?\" \"Ah.. .that's a hard one, Grandpa. I'm not sure,\" said Adam hesitantly. So Grandpa said, \"Imagine that you've found a bee- hive and you're teasing the bees by throwing custard pies at them. The bees get really angry, fly out of the hive and sting you on the bottom.\" \"This is great fun,\" said the kids. \"Five is HIVE—CUSTARD PIE.\" 48 49"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\"OK, kids, we're halfway through our list,\" said Grandpa. \"Let's see how many you can remember.'

You've remembered the first five items on the list easily. As you can see, your memories are excel- lent!\" said Grandpa. Now the kids were becoming really good at making up silly stories and were eager to do the last five.
