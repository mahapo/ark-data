"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" 6 Preface In 1970, when Ritalin prescription use wa s around 200,000, our country was alarmed enough that a subcommittee of the Committee on Gove rnment Operations of the United States Congress held hearings entitled “Feder al Involvement in the use of Behavioral Modification Drugs on Grammar School Children.” In 1971, the Drug Enforcement Administra tion (DEA) classified Ritalin (methylphenidate) and other amphetamines as Schedule II dr ugs of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substanc es, a category that indicates significant risk of abuse and limited medical value. Despite these apparent concerns and safeguar ds, the explosion in use of psychiatric drugs with children in this country has been phenomenal. Let me just give you here the story of the last 5 years of the millennium. Sacramento Bee journalist Dorsey Griffith, in her June 23, 2002 article, “P ills or Patience,” reported data on the number of times psychiatric drugs were prescribed or refilled for children under 18 during hospital or doctor visits in the years 1995-96 and the year 2000. Regarding stimulant drugs, there was an increase of 84%, fr om a little under 2,887, 000 to 5,316,000. To our added disgrace as a nation, we are also drugging our children in huge numbers with other toxic and danger ous psychiatric drugs. Griffith reveals that there has been a 166% increase in prescriptions for the so -called antidepressants, from 1,414,000 to 3,160,000 in that same five-year period. You are probably aware of the rec ent storm of media and regulatory body activity flowing from revelation that the drug industry and the FDA had suppress ed data showing that the so- called SSRI antidepressants caused troubling central nervous system states in a percentage of people who take them, and that thes e states tended to create or exacerbate violent thoughts and feelings, sometimes resulting in suicide or homici de. We know these drugs are very dangerous. In Great Britain, they are now effe ctively banned for children. Under gr eat pressure from activists, especially parents whose children had committed suicide under the effects of the SSRIs, our own FDA agreed to put a very serious black box warning on these drug labels. This trend to drug more and more of our children and t eenagers with these dangerous serotoner gic substances is deeply troubling, especially when one faces the fact that the fastest gro wing segment of users are age 0- 5!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 7 The same trends are there for the so-c alled sedative-hypnotics and anti-anxiety drugs. I was especially shocked to see a 281% increase, from 329,000 to 1,253,000 for the antipsychotic drugs. These drugs like Thoraz ine, Haldol and Zyprexa are known to consistently produce permanent neurological dysfunction in those who take them. (See Robert Whitaker’s new book, Mad in America, for the latest powerful wakeup call on the sordid tale of systematic brain damage for the sa ke of profit.) The bottom line is that we are giving stronger and stronger psyc hiatric drugs to more and more children. Even infants and toddlers are being drugged wit h these substances. Based on this available data, a realistic es timate is that over 9,000,000 school-age children in the United States are on powerful psychiatric drugs today. That amounts to about 15% of our young people. Ot her than our neighbor Canada, no other countries in the world are using psychiatric drugs this way wit h their children; it is a distinctly North American phenomenon. Even the most ardent Ritalin/A DHD enthusiasts find absolutely no positive long-term outcomes on anything in their research reviews. Short-term, there is only one—conformity in the classroom. The human brain is awesom e, its intricacy and complexity beyond our ability to fathom. No drug impr oves its function; all psychiatr ic drugs work by producing brain malfunction. Ritalin, like other stimulant drugs, works by turning curiosity, exploration and socializing (expansive att ention) into isolated, repet itive, stereotypical behavior (narrowing of attention). This has been demonstrated repeatedly in animals. Psychiatry’s deliberate lies and misinformation in perpetrating the unnecessary drugging of millions of our children are only part of this story of the betraya l of our nation’s children and families. The government plays a critical role in this perpetra tion by funding dangerous, life- threatening drug research on our ch ildren for “treatment” of these fictitious diseases, primarily through the National Institut e of Mental Health. The government also covers up our nation’s failure to meet our children’s needs by actively spr eading the propaganda lie th at we have all these “mentally ill” children who need the right drugs to control their biologically or genetically based diseases, failing to accept the truth that no science supports this claim. "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 8 It gets worse than even this gross malfeasanc e. The government, through its public schools, through its courts, and thr ough its so-called child protecti ve services agencies, creates, promotes and allows the deliberate coercion of parent s to drug their children. School personnel routinely pressure parents to consider psychiatric drugs for their children. The courts enforce psychiatric orders to drug children. Today, it has gotten so bad that parents who resist psychiatric orders to drug their children are accused of medical negligen ce and threatened with loss of cust ody. Doing the right thing in defense of their children has actually caused parent s in our country to have their children taken away by the state. What is behind all this? And what happens to the children whom the state steps in to protect? An incredibly high per centage of children who have become wards of the state are placed on psychiatric drugs. Analysis of Medicaid data on foster child ren for November 2003, obtained from the state Comptroller, show that over 2/3 of these childre n are on psychotropic drugs; about half of them are on stimulants, a bout 15% on the so-called antidepre ssants. I have confronted this again and again over the years so I am not too easily shocked, but I have to tell you that I was really shaken when I saw that about 17% of these kids were on the antipsychotic, neuroleptic drugs. As mentioned above, it is a very tragic, but very tr ue statement that we are inflicting permanent neurological brai n damage on these children. One more extremely troubling piece from this data: a very large number (869 in the private child placing agencies alon e) are victims of what we call polypharmacy, the practice of giving childr en multiple psychotropic drugs at the same time. These pharmaceutical trends in foster care are true across the country. The general outcomes are equally sad: An Editorial B oard Special Report of T he San Francisco Chronicle ( “No Refuge,” 11 September 2005) presented the following foster-c are children facts: . Nearly a third will become homeless at some ti me within the first year after they leave the system at age 18.... . Fewer than 10 percent enroll in colle ge and 1 percent actually graduate. . 50 percent will become unemployed...."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" 9 . 25 percent will become incarcer ated within the first 2 years after they leave the system. .

The boy's teacher told this young mother that her boy was having some problems in the classroom and expressed her concern that he was showing symptoms of \"Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\" (ADHD). Th e teacher informed this mother that her son was somewhat disruptive and recommended that s he seek a medical consultation for the boy. The teacher gave my client some lit erature on \"attention-deficit hype ractivity disorder\" and a list of referral names. She assured this young mother, w ho has little money, that the state (Medicaid) would pay for this important medical help. When my client began to ask questions, the teacher pointed out the boy's cluttered desk—a \"symptom\" of this \"disease.\" She a sked if it was hard to get the boy's attention when he watched television. The mother's yes answer revealed th is as another \"symptom\" of the \"disease.\" The teacher gave her a checklist of \"symptoms\" including \"f requency of climbing behavior\" (too much climbing was another symptom). The National Institute of Mental Health informs us that one out of 10 young boys “suffer from\" this dreaded disease. An estimat ed six million take stimulant drugs like Ritalin and Adderall, which our Drug Enforcement Administration classifies as Class II along with morp hine, barbiturates and other prescription drugs that have a high pot ential for addiction or abuse. The so-called \"side effects\" include sadness, depression, social withdrawal, flattened emotions and loss of energy. Long-term use tends to create the very same pr oblems that the stimul ants are supposed to combat—attentional disturbances, memory problems, irritability and hyperactivity. Rates have been rising dramatically in other psychiatric drug use categorie s; perhaps three million more young people take the so-called ant idepressant and antipsychotic drugs. So, according to current psychiatric thought, a high activity level, playful interaction with peers in the classroom, a cluttered de sk, difficulty getting a boy's a ttention while he is watching television (I have never met anyone for whom this is not true) and too mu ch climbing are all indications of a psychiatric disorder. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" 17 Something is seriously wrong here! Millions of ch ildren, mostly boys, are being forced to take dangerous drugs—not because they have suffered or are suffering from a dreaded medical disease, but because we, as a society, have chos en to turn normal behavior (activity, energy, zest, spirit, absorption in television, climbing, challenging authority—which is demanding you do something you are not interested in or r eady for) into “symptoms” of a “disease.” It used to be these boys were considered incorrigi ble or bad (sinful); theology was used to coerce, punish, control, and dem and conformity. Now it is done in the name of medical science; institutional psychiatry is used to control and coerce. These boys are no longer bad; now they are sick, suffering from a \"disease.\" The view of those people who pr omote these ideas is that we can help them with drugs. It just so happens that those same people can make an enormous profit while doing so much good. I felt that my session with this young woman saved a child from the “psychiatric police.” I wrote a letter to the editor of the lo cal newspaper describing the above experience. This letter initiated an unexpected chain of events t hat has resulted in the book y ou are now reading. My letter evoked many calls and a controversial series of letters on both sides of this ADHD issue. On January 13, 1995, the Austin American-State sman published an editorial by me entitled “Widespread Misuse of Ritalin Is a National Disgrace.” T he controversy became even more heated. One frequent response I got, sometimes in a friendly tone and sometimes in an accusatory one, was, “Well, what are your solutions then?” In response to this I wrote a booklet called The Wildest Colts Make The Best Horses . The little colt of a booklet, born out of my struggle to respond to what I see as a tragic and unfortunat e situation, has grown into this book. Contrary to the popular homily, this is one book you can tell by its cover. The title, The Wildest Colts Make The Best Horses , conveys an attitude t hat ennobles and supports an effort to defend and enhance the spirits of our young people. For practical reasons, this book is very much oriented toward parents. If you are a teacher or counselor or other adult ally of young people, please include your self, as I include you in my thinking. The principles are the same, and many, perhaps most of you, are also parents. I want all you teachers and counselors to see how I tend to think about and communicate to parents. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" 18 I have divided the book into three major sections. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" 19 Part I: RECOGNITION AND REMEMBRANCE To respond effectively to a situation, we need a r ealistic picture of that situation. In my view, our society greatly distorts r eality in regards to the experi ence of young people and schools. Specifically, I address the practice of what I call BioPsychiatry (i.e., the reduction in our thinking about human beings to biological and genetic f unction and the subsequent use of drugs and/or electric shock to “treat” that function). Rec ognizing and understanding BioPsychiatry is crucial to effectively respond to the fact that we have about nine million children on psychiatric drugs today in the United States and to deal with the pressures we receive to drug our own children. The section on RECOGNITION also pres ents ideas that I think are impor tant to realize about schools and a few key beliefs that influence the way we relate to our children. This part of the book is also about REMEMBRANCE . It is extremely challenging to be a parent under any circumstance (or to be a parent surrogate such as a teac her or other adult caregiver). Our society is not set up to effectively support those who care for our young. It is even more challenging, and often overwhelming, to be a parent when y our child is having a hard time or not “acting right.” When others, such as school and mental health authori ties, are pressuring you to do something about your child's problems, the stress becomes even more intense. I think that at these times we are most likely to forget who we really are, who our child really is, and what is r eally important. My goal in this se ction is to provide a few remi nders toward re-remembering the true nature of your child and of yourself as a parent. I also prov ide a few pointers to hold onto during this stressful time. Part II: INFORMATION AND ACTION This section covers several areas that respond to that original questi on of “What are your solutions then?” The emphasis of this section is on Action — what else you can do as an adult to help your child. My experience was that I got prec ious little good information to prepare me for my role as a parent. I am very aware of how extremely difficult it is to implement the ideas I present in the face of our distressed society. I hope that what I offer here will help you respond to the challenge of parenting and being good allies to our young people. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" 20 I have chosen to alternate gender pronouns at will, especially in describing children, rather than attempt to neuter, pluralize or simply use the masculine for c onvenience sake. It is my view that sex differences need not affect parenting decisions exc ept when determining how best to counter the heavy gender conditio ning that comes down on boys and girls in their respective cultures. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" 21 Part III: ON COUNSELING CHILDREN This section contains t he heart of what I offer in this book. I know that the theory I present here is a tremendous affront to much of the conventi onal wisdom and conditioned thinking with which we are all thoroughly saturated. I also know it is a tremendous challe nge to implement this approach in the face of what I call parental oppr ession and lack of support for children, parents and families in our society. I understand that it is not possible for teacher s in our current school setup. Therefore I go into some depth on key areas including sham e, crying, fear and anger. In addition, I share my own experience as a parent, par ticularly some of the trials, tribulations and successes I've had with my son, Eric. I humbly offe r the teachings that have been helpful to me with the caveat that this is one father who does not know best. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" 22 PART I: RECOGNITION AND REMEMBRANCE "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" 23 CHAPTER 1 About BioPsychiatry The Illusionary Veil. About nine million school-age childr en are on psychiatric drugs in the United States today. We can only guess at how many more children manage to avert drug us e like my client's son I told you about in the Introduction. I do know from my own parenting workshops and consulting work that parents receive imm ense pressure to put their children on psychoactive drugs. I also know from this work that many parent s do a tremendous job of courageously resisting this pressure. It is safe to say that, for every child put on drugs, there are many more who would be if not for valiant parent resistance, and counselors and teachers who resist. In order to see something clearly, it is necessary to remove any veil that covers or obscures it. BioPsychiatry is such a veil and me rits our critical examination. Young people today are brought in to our mental health system literally by the millions. Significant entry points into this system appear to be around key transitions or passages into new levels of societal demand. It is becoming a well-know n observation that as a society we fail to help our young people make a successful passage into adulthood. Youth despair is massive. Suicide rates for adolescents have nearly tripled since 1950, a clear indicator of our failure. Colt (1991) points out that “advances in m edicine have lowered the mortalit y rate for every age group in America, except fifteen to twenty-four-year olds, whose rate has risen, largely because of the increase in suicides. (300% incr ease in suicide rate for ten to fourteen year olds.)” Major breakdowns, or simply the failure to become productive members of society during this challenging passage from adolesc ence into young adulthood, are c onsidered signs or symptoms of mental illness. Treatment begins. My observation is that, in the case of stimul ants and ADHD, there are two major portals into the mental health system. The first is entry into elementary school. Hundreds of thousands of five, six and seven-year-old children are diagnosed, l abeled and “treated” with drug s. Entry into middle school and/or junior high is the second major por tal. Extremely large num bers of young people flounder during this transition. Very many are t hen introduced to the mental health system. Many more, already initiated, go deeper into the system."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" 24 These are facts about a large-scale, societal phenomenon. Millions of children and parents go through a specific, singular expe rience. Johnny enters school and somehow it does not go well. Although his learning and even hi s grades may be fine, somehow he doesn't act right. He is seen as restless and distractible, or vague and spacey. Sometimes it's the other way around. He is polite and cooperative, but he doesn't learn. More often he lear ns, but is unorganized or doesn't seem to care about turning in his work, so he gets bad grades. Johnny's teacher, Ms. Jones, is concerned. She may or may not be frustrated or irritated; she is definitely concerned. Like vi rtually all teachers today, she has been introduced through a class or workshop to mental health system information about the identification and treatment of ADHD. Most likely, the information she received incl uded dramatic case illu strations presented as modern, up-to-date, clinical scientific research emphasizing diagnostic criteria and symptomatology. With easy-to-use behavioral chec klists provided as screening devices, the importance of referral and evalua tion by a trained mental health pr ofessional was stressed. She was no doubt told that Ritalin has been shown to be safe and effective in treating many children with this disease. In her workshop, Ms. Jones learned that the o fficial standard for ADHD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (D SM) of the American Psychiatric Association requires six of the following items listed for inattent ive or hyperactive-impulsive ADHD: I. Inattentive ADHD Crit eria (6 of 9 present) A. Fails to give close attention to details B. Difficulty sustaining attention C. Does not appear to listen D. Has difficulty following instructions E. Difficulty with organization B. Avoids tasks requiring sustained attention F. Often loses things G. Easily distracted H. Forgetful in daily activities"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" 25 II. Hyperactive, Impulsive ADHD Criteria (6 of 9 present) A. Fidgets or squirms B. Difficulty staying seated C. Runs or climbs inappropriately D. Difficulty engaging in activities quietly E. Always \"on the go\", \"driven by a motor\" F. Talks excessively G. Blurts out answers H. Difficulty in waiting their turn I. Interrupts or intrudes upon others This teacher was also taught t hat ADHD is a specif ic “mental illness” with a genetic and biochemical cause. As a memb er of the public, she has been exposed repeatedly to media information such as a recent Associated Press wir e article with a headline stating that “Attention deficit disorder plagues two million kids.” The arti cle poses the question: “What is attention deficit disorder?” The answer: “It is a biochemical c ondition that affects school-age children and is characterized by a short attention span.” Ms. Jones was also shown how to use behavioral checklists. The resident Austin authority on ADHD recommends two checklists in her workshops . The first involves ratings of severity on problems with attending and concentrati ng in various situations su ch as individual work, group activities, free time and field trips. The second, ca lled ADHD Rating Scale, is a four point (“Not at all” to “Very much”) rating of the exact behavio rs listed above from the diagnostic manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association. Ms. Jones is concerned about Johnny. She has eval uated him according to the criteria on her behavioral checklists. She calls his parents in for a conference, expresses her concerns and offers her opinion that he may have ADHD. She em phasizes that she is not a mental health professional and recommends that t hey take Johnny in for an evaluation by a psychiatrist to make an official diagnosis. There may be an intermediary referral to a non-medical professional lower in the mental health hierarchy, perhaps even worki ng within the school. This professional will then evaluate Johnny and subsequently refer him to a psychiatrist for medical considerations. Many"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":" 26 parents understandably trust and immedi ately defer to the opinions and advice of these trained professionals. Those who resist often experience tremendous pressure to “do what's best for your child” and give him the medicati on he needs for his disease. The truth about ADHD and stimulants is very different from the brief education just described. Here is some information that te achers and counselors need to know. BioPsychiatry is the institutionalized practi ce of selecting indivi duals on the basis of appearance and behavior, identifying t hem as mentally ill, and tr eating them with drugs and/or electroshock. BioPsychiatry is based on a very specific set of guiding principles that are as follows: (1) Adjustment to society (school) is good. (2) Failure to adjust is the re sult of mental illness (ADHD). (3) Mental Illness (ADHD) is a medical disease. (4) Mental Illness (ADHD) is the result of biological and/or genetic defects. (5) Mental Illness (ADHD) is incurable. (6) Mental Illness (ADHD) can be controlled prim arily by drugs, secondarily, for really serious mental illness, by electroshock. With these assumptions in mind, I will now examine the mechanisms by which BioPsychiatry enforces its position and interferes with (cloaks) our ability to see the truth of what is going on. The first mechanism is most profound. It suppresses the natural process, ad dressed in detail later in this book, by which people resolve emotionally charged experiences. The core of institutional psychiatry is the suppression of emotional expr ession. Mainstream (meani ng the agencies of the economically, politically and socia lly powerful in society) mental health practices center around systematic inhibition of emotional expression. The heart of current BioPsychiatry practice is psychopharmacology. Other control patterns range from seemingly benevolent (psychotherapy atte mpts to soothe away “too much crying”) to cruel and severely damaging practices such as electroshock and psychosurgery. Psychiatry's physical treatments (drugs, shock and psychosurger y) are often used coer cively and almost always without genuine informed consent. Much of child ren's problematic (disrupting or otherwise"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":" 27 not adjusting to classroom expectations) behavior may be seen as an attempt on the part of these children to show where they have been hurt and to express emotions associated with having been hurt. Drugging children sends a very clear mess age and acts as a powerful suppressant of emotional expression. The second mechanism by which BioPsychiatry obs cures reality involves a trick of magic or sleight of hand. The mechanism is indirection and illusion. “Now you see it, now you don't.” “Before you get a glimpse of social injustice, let me show you m ental illness.” “Before you think about racism and economic injustice, let me show you genetic predispositi on to violence in young black males.” Institutional psychiatry has been so su ccessful in their magic show that few people realize that “mental illness” is, at best, mere ly a metaphor. To quote Peter Breggin (1994), foremost writer and outspoken c hallenger of the tenet s of BioPsychiatry: “It is scientifically incontrovertible that there is no convincing evidence that any condi tion routinely seen by psychiatrists has a genetic or biological origin.” (p. 188) The concept of mental illness was originally created as a metaphor in order to establish medical/scien tific credibility for the accepted practices of responding to people in dist ress or in deviance from social norms. I presented the ADHD checklists in some detail to clearly show that the criteria for this alleged disease are strictly social and behavioral—no blood tests, urine tests, tiss ue samples, x-rays, etc. ADHD is not diagnosed by medical tests. Ment al illness is a metaphor; ADHD is a metaphor saying that this behavioral phenomenon is a me dical disease. Let me illustrate with two metaphors. Johnny runs fast and swift, a deer runs fast and swift; Johnny is a deer. Johnny is restless and inattent ive to school tasks, a person wi th organic brain syndrome is restless and inattentive; Johnny is a medical disease (ADHD). As Diane McGuinness (1989) reports in her thoroughly researched chapter on Attention Deficit Disorder, “the emperor has no clothes.” She convin cingly demonstrates the absence of any valid diagnostic procedure, as well as the failure of drug therapy to facilitate any academic, social or emotional well-being for the child. She thoroughly debunks the notion that research on ADHD bears any approximation to neut ral, “pure” scientific research. The initial impact of stimulant drugs"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":" 28 on behavior makes it very difficult to dislodge m edical practitioners and othe r believers from their point of view. The truth is, however, as McGuinne ss concludes, that “the data consistently fail to support any benefits from stimulant medication.” Harmful effects continue to be minimized. The agency of BioPsychiatry is performing the gr eatest magic show on earth. The incredible illusion of biologically caused mental illness serves as a powerful enforcer of oppression, consistently distracting our attent ion from the reality of social in justice and the devastating results on individuals and society. BioP sychiatry says that millions of children have a medical disease called ADHD. I say there is a need to look at t he schools, at families, at community, at all the social justice issues involved in how we care for young people in our society. I'll give you a hint now on one key to see through this illusion. ADHD is “big business.” Keep your eye on where the money goes. Or as invest igative journalists are adv ised, \"Follow the money.\" The third way that BioPsychiatry acts to prevent close examination of our situation with the care of our young has a much more elastic quality, adapting to specific groups and individuals. It really doesn't function as a clear universal symbol; I think it 's more like law enforcement. It is hard to get hold of because the laws, though well-known, are unwritten. They are the laws of oppression, the laws of adultism, racism, sexism , heterosexism, anti-Semitism, etc. The mechanism is simple. If a person steps outside the bounds of t he oppressive conditioning (i.e., fa ils to act in the way that a child, woman, man, person of co lor, etc., is supposed to act) , then the agents of institutional psychiatry are available to punish her for her transgression, enforcing her prescribed role. If a child doesn't act right and produce in school, label her mentally ill and give her drugs. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":" 29 Piercing the Veil Recognize what is really going on. Your child is being chosen as a subject for a massive, unprecedented experiment using powerful mood-altering drugs to modify the behavio r of young people. It is vitally important that you know and understand t he following concepts. I. Your child is being selected out because of “unacceptable” behavior. Institutional psychiatry and compulsory, age-gr aded, competitive education have many things in common. For one, both place a high value on SELEC TION. You need to recognize that your child, along with millions of other youngsters, is being selected out bas ed on a judgment that his or her behavior is unacceptable. Psychiatry and education bear the burden of a societal mandate to enforce sameness and conformity as evidenced by proper adjustment to in stitutional standards. There is precious little room for celebrating uniqueness and diversity. II. Selection means diagnosis means treatment. You need to recognize the illusion that underlies the entire proc ess of labeling and diagnosing children. Your child is selected, and you are referred to a “mental health professional” (a medical doctor psychiatrist or a university doctor psychol ogist) for an “evaluation” to determine a “diagnosis” and decide whether your child really does have a psychiatric disorder. The truth is that the whole process of psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis is, for t he most part, a sham. There is value at times in educational di agnosis if someone doe s it who really kn ows and understands how children learn. All too often prof essionals have little awareness of the absurdity of age-segregated learning and the expectat ion that all children should learn at the same pace in the same style....or else the pressure to produce results on high stakes testing is too great. Once your child is selected, a th oroughly predictable result is set in motion. It is extremely rare for a child referred to a psychiatrist of psychol ogist for evaluation of a “disruptive behavior disorder” (DBD) not to be give n a diagnosis. These people are in the business of giving diagnoses. And DBDs (including conduc t disorders and so-called ADHD) are one of those peculiar “diseases” in which the subjective experience of the adults around the “patient” determines the presenc e of the “disease.” The main criteria for diagnosis have nothing to do with the state of the “pati ent’s body or psyche. "},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":" 30 Furthermore, you need to know that diagnosis is not really about describin g your child in a way that will give useful information to help enhance development. Psychiatric diagnosis is not descriptive, but prescriptive . Just as referral almost inevitably leads to diagnosis, diagnosis means treatment. When your child is selected out as a behavior problem, he or she is being chosen for “treatment” and “special” services. III. Treatment means drugs. You need to know that institutional psychi atry operates from a narrow viewpoint called BioPsychiatry, which is based on three specific assumptions. The first assumption is that human distress is a result of “mental il lness.” The second is that “mental illness” consists of a tremendous (and growing all the time) assortment of “diseases” classified together in th e psychiatric bible: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the Am erican Psychiatric Association. By translating human behavior into medical diseases, this manual acts as a key to open the treasure chest of medical health insurance dollars. Incredibly enough, problems with school behavior have been translated into this system. “Treatment” of thes e disorders is now an ex tremely profitable and rapidly growing business for t he pharmacology industry and psych iatric profession. The third assumption of BioPsychiatry, then, is that these “diseases” are caused by biological and genetic defects in the “sick” individual. The “treatment” of choice for your poor child is, of course, pharmacological (i.e., drugs). IV. These drugs are dangerous. You are told that these drugs are benign. You ne ed to recognize that this is self-serving misinformation. I will focus here on Ritalin, which is very popular ; know, however, that its great competitor, Adderall, a combinat ion of three amphetamines in one pill, has a very similar effects profile, and its long-term version, AdderallXR, was banned for awhile in Canada last year, as a result of a series of pediatri c deaths in the United States! An estimated 6,000,000 young people, mostly boys, are on stimul ant drugs in this country. You probabl y were not told that Ritalin is “speed,” pharmacologically classi fied with amphetamines and havin g the same effects, side effects and risks. The FDA classifies Ritalin in a high addictive categor y (Schedule II) along with amphetamines, cocaine, morphine, opium, and barbiturates. This drug’s adverse reactions are described below, in an excerpt from the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) on the potential adverse reactions caused by Ritalin: "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":" 31 Nervousness and insomnia are the most common adv erse reactions but are usually controlled by reducing dosage and omitting the drug in t he afternoon and the evening. Other reactions include hypersensitivity (including skin rash), urti caria [swollen, itching patches of skin], fever, arthralgia, exfoliative dermati tis [scaly patches of skin], erythema multiforme [an acute inflammatory skin disease], with histopathological fi ndings of necrotizing vasculitis [destruction of the blood vessels], and thrombo cytopenic purpura [a serious blood clotting disorder]; anorexia; nausea; dizziness; palpitations; headache; dyski nesia [impairment of voluntary muscle movement]; drowsiness; blood pressure and pulse changes, both up and down; tachycardia [rapid heartbeat]; angina [spasmodic attacks of intens e heart pain]; cardiac arrhythmia [irregular heartbeat]; abdominal pain, weight loss during prolonged therapy. There have been rare reports of Tourette’s sy ndrome. Toxic psychosis has been reported in patients taking this drug; luekopenia [reduction in white blood cells] and/or anemia; a few instances of scalp hair loss. In children, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, weight loss during prolonged therapy, insomnia, and tachycardia ma y occur more frequently; however, any of the other adverse reactions listed above may also occur. Robert Mendelsohn, M.D., a we ll-known and outspoken critic of much standard medical practice comments on the above excerpt: This is the kind of information about a drug that the manufacturer is compelled by law to share with the doctors who will pr escribe it. Unfortunately, there is no law requiring that the doctors who prescribe the drug share the info rmation about its potentially damaging or fatal effects with you. That is why I have provided so much informati on about Ritalin, which applies, as well, to its counter parts. (1984, pp. 203-4) It should also be mentioned that Rit alin stunts the growth of the child's whole body including the brain. This is one r eason “drug holidays” (periods of time o ff from taking the drug) tend to be emphasized. More subtle, but profound, is the a rrest of emotional an d social development. Children are denied the opportunity to work thr ough issues and the maturation process drug free. Finally, I think there is a significant tendency of child Ritalin users to become addicted to psychiatric (or street) drugs we ll into their adolescent years and longer. I haven't seen research studies on this, but I have seen a great deal of anecdotal evidence."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":" 32 The Austin TV news reported rec ently that Ritalin was the most popular recreational drug on the University of Texas campus. After conducti ng an eight-month investigation, John Merrow, executive producer of a public television docu mentary on ADHD, in an Op-ed piece published in The New York Times , October 21, 1995, reported: Ritalin is so plentiful that in some junior high schools it's a “gateway drug,” the first drug a child experiments with. “I used to mix it with marijuana,” a re covering teenage addict in Maryland said. “It gives you a nice buzz.” Reports of Ritalin theft and abuse in schools are commonplace, alarming the Dr ug Enforcement Agency (DEA). “We've now begun to see deaths from this drug,” said Mr. Haislip, DEA Director of Diversi on Control. “We had a recent death in Roanoke, where a child died fr om snorting this drug like Cocaine.” Merrow also reported that Ritalin's manufacture r, Ciba-Geigy, has giv en nearly $900,000 in cash grants to a group called Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD). This money, along with in-kind services, has helped CH ADD grow from a sma ll regional organization into a national powerh ouse with 35,000 members, 650 chapter s and clout in Washington. CHADD is lobbying to relax DEA controls on Ritalin. In the meantime, the propaganda is relentless. V. These drugs do not help your child. You are told that Ritalin really works, that it has been proven effective. What this means is that some children “behave much better” when t hey’re on Ritalin. Proponents of the drug will tell you that the drug works because it corrects a biological/neurologica l defect in the child. You need to know that this is entirely a statement of fa ith on the order of a religious belief. There is no scientific evidence to show any consistent biol ogical or genetic cause of any problem routinely seen by psychiatrists, most definitely including t he so-called DBDs of sc hool children. Children diagnosed as ADHD do not res pond to Ritalin because it correct s a biological defect; they respond because they’re taking an amphetamine. A long-demonstrated effect of amphetamines is that users experience a narrowed focus of attent ion and concentration on detail and are less in touch with their real feelings. Any child becomes more docile, obedient and willing to concentrate on boring, repetitive tasks—all desirabl e qualities in a school setting. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" 33 You need to know also that Ritalin is addictive , that it interferes wit h development (including that of the brain) and t hat many children experi ence other serious effect s, including permanent disfiguring tics. As a stimulan t, Ritalin can cause the very th ings it is supposed to cure— inattention, hyperactivity and aggr ession. Withdrawal effects, such as the child getting upset after missing a single dose, are mistakenly interpreted as a sign that the child needs to be put back on medication. What they probably didn’t tell you is that “years of re search and clinical use have failed to confirm any positive l ong-term effects from Ritalin in behavior or academic performance.” (Breggin & Breggin, p. 84) VI. Recognize Adultism. Adultism is the systematic mist reatment of children and young people simply because they are young. The overall conditioning against emotional expr ession is laid down through adultism. The pattern is one of massive disrespect. To test w hether or not you are acting as an agent of this oppression, apply the following question to any action you take toward a young person: Would you treat another adult the same way? Since we are all thoroughly c onditioned to treat children a certain way, we must make every e ffort to challenge our conditioning. VII. Recognize the code word “Potential.” The use of the word \"potential\" is all too reflec tive of a corporate economic emphasis on future profit. Focusing on a child’s “potent ial” is subtle adultism, and adults who do so have lost sight of the child. Do not trust the thinking of anyone who keep s emphasizing the “potent ial” of your child ; rather, put your trust in those w ho can celebrate and delight in who your child already is. It is good to have relaxed , high expectations for your child. Just don't let your expectations distract you from paying attention to what is going on now. I think it is probably most wise and accurate to assume that whatever your child is doing now , whatever she is showing you now, is already a brilliant expression of wh at she needs now . It's our challenge as parents or other adult allies to think well and respond effectively. I was at an extended family gathering with my then almost 5-year-old daughter. Vanessa showed a picture she had just creat ed to her great aunt. Aunt Helen responded lovingly, saying to Vanessa, “What a great artist you are going to be when you grow up!” I think my daughter's response reveals the essence of what I'm trying to say here. Vanessa was insulted. She boldly faced my aunt, with hands on hips, and declared, “I already am!”"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" 34 VIII. New Freedom and TMAP: It is Never Enough If any of you readers think I am overly dr amatic in my concern about the psychiatric drugging of our children, consider the simple fact that my estimate of 9 million children in this country on psychiatric drugs is conservative. Re member that is about 1 out of 7 children on powerful, addictive, mind and body alteri ng substances. Then consider this. In 2003, The President’s so-called New Freedom Commission came out with its recommendations for our country’s mental health system. The New Freedom Commission report states that \"Schools are in a key position to identify mental health problems early, and to provide a link to appropriate services.\" Its 52 milli on young people and 6 million adults are a ready population. This may sound like a good idea to find needy “mentally ill” people. Given, however, that already at least 15% of the children are on drugs, it seem s ludicrous to think access to services is a problem. Even more troubling is the fact th at many of the New Freedom commissioners are linked directly or indirectly to the Texas Medical Algor ithm Project (TMAP), which provides formulas recommending specific psychotropic drugs to treat various \"mental illnesses.\" According to whistl eblower reports, TMAP pushes an o ff-label drug-marketing scheme that appears to skirt federal law. An ongoing investigation is un derway right now. We already know that TMAP was developed in Texas in the mid 1990s by a committee that was significantly funded by major pharmaceutical compani es with direct interest in the results. We know many of the committee members had direct fi nancial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. We know that for every $1000 donated by a pharmaceutical company to the state of Texas to support TMAP development, the companies yiel ded at least $1,000,000 in profit--in just one year--for a main product that was included in the algor ithm adopted by t he state. A 2005 Mother Jones magazine article called “Medicating Aliah”, by Rob Waters, prov ides an excellent introduc tion to this subject. We know, therefore, that this commission' s recommendations are in tended to encourage an expansion of the fact that \"appropriate services\" in today's psychiatric world means psychotropic drugs, and that th ere are already an estimated 9-million school-age children on psychiatric drugs. We consider th is to represent a tragic situat ion, and a clear and present danger to our children. One of the main points is that our country should move toward universal mental health screening of its citizens, with the public sc hools being one of the firs t target populations. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":" 35 The government is pushing hard to implement its New Freedom Initiative; the public is fighting equally hard to defend parent al rights and limit government in trusion. An Internet search easily yields a glimpse in to the firestorm. I reco mmend Ken Kramer’s site, www.psychsearch.net/teenscr een, as a good start for the interest ed reader. Ken's site documents the whole truth about Teen Screen, a very controve rsial so-called \"diagnostic psychiatric service,\" aka suicide survey; done on children who are then referred to psychia tric treatment. \"It's just a way to put more people on prescription drugs,\" said Marcia Angell, a medica l ethics lecturer at Harvard Medical School, former ch ief editor of the New England Jour nal of Medicine, and author of The Truth About Drug Companies . Relevant to my comment sin the preface about the rising use of the SSRIs, Angell said su ch programs would boost the sale of antidepressants even after the FDA in September ordered that \"black box\" label warning that the pills might spur suicidal thoughts or actions in minors. (The New York Post, December 5, 2004). Teen Screen is about gover nment intrusion in the schools, in the interests of corporate profit. The claims to virtue are false rhetoric. Teen Screen does not prevent suicide, it does not serve to promote the well- being of our children. It is, in fact, a powerful tool to access and recruit clients for the drug industry. Tw o actovist groups, Texans For Sa fe Education and Parents For a Label and Drug Free Education, co sponsored a powerful statement on the New Freedom Initiative push for universal mental health screening; it may be read at http://www.ablechild.org/decla ration%20of%20refusal.aspx. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Summary We know that the doctrine and pr actice of biological psychiatry is based in belief rather than proven science. The psychiatr ic drugging of children is not bas ed on any legitimate scientific results. It is an absolute fact that none of t he primary child psychiatric diagnoses has been demonstrated to be of biological or genetic origin. There is no co nfirmatory physical or chemical abnormality for any of the diagnoses, such as ADHD or bipolar disorder or depression. We also know that the drugs are toxic, and dangerous, adversely affecti ng all organs systems of the body. We know they generally \"work\" no better than placebo or exercise, or a host of kind alternatives. We have already at least 9,000,000, and perhaps 11,000,000 school age children on psychiatric drugs in this country. That is not evi dence of lack of access or uni dentified \"mentally ill\" children; it is evidence of shameful, disgraceful institutional ized child abuse. Corporate Pharma dynamics have two closely related values, and it is only these two that drive decisions; they are maximum profit and minimum liabili ty. There is no limit to the pus h for an expanded market, for more children to drug. Once the rhet orical veil is removed, it is no t hard to see that is what New Freedom and Teen Screen are really about. However well intended we educat ional and mental health prof essionals might be, many of us are naive and misinformed. The tragic truth is that the reason so many children are drugged is because it is profitable, and because the industry has wielded it s immense bankroll to corrupt the politicians and regulatory agencies, and to fl ood the public with false propaganda. We absolutely must recognize that we are being expected to unquestioningly accept decisions for our children that t hey be selected out for special treat ment and given drugs. We are expected to believe that our children have a diseas e and that this special treatment is for their own good. We are often made to question our ow n responsibility and worth as parents, teachers, or counselors if we choose to re sist something that is so obvi ously necessary and good for our “special” children. The reality is very diffe rent than this Alice-in-Wonderland, upside-down distortion. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 CHAPTER 2 About Schools A Note to Teachers Teachers are one of the most devoted, hard-wo rking groups of indi viduals on the planet. You work long hours, facing many demands and c hallenges. You show up day after day at a school, handling a full classroom of young people entrusted to yo u by our society. You devote hours upon hours to extra work outs ide the classroom. I truly doubt that I would hav e the stamina to handle the job. Teachers are subject to ever-increasing pre ssure and demands related to high-stakes testing and accountability structur es. It is my own view that t hese high-stakes systems are wrong- headed and make it very difficult to find satisfac tion in the work you have chosen—but that is another subject. My purpose in this note is simply to validate and appreciate you and your work. This chapter on schools points out in a st rong way some problems with our schools. These concerns—as reflected, for example, in the work of John Taylor Gatto, are not meant as an indictment of teachers. The tr uth is I think teachers do remark ably well under the circumstances. My own daughter, Vanessa, is a sophomore at a typi cally huge public high school in Austin, and her teachers work very very hard, and are mo stly kind and consider ate individuals. I deeply appreciate them. My concerns, and critiques like Gatto’s, are about the structure. I hate huge schools for young people; to my mind, small is beautiful when it comes to educati on. I loathe so-called high- stakes accountability testing for the intense pressure it puts on everyone, and the tendencies to teach to the test, and etc. I see it as a perversion of education. I have spoken with many teachers and the vast majority of them do not like it at all. So bless all you teachers! I just think we could do way better in prov iding more wholesome environments for you and our children. Part of my work is to point out what I consider pr oblematic directions, and to make suggestions on how to help our children best nav igate under the present circumstances. This chapter is presented in such light."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 39 The Thing About School Later in this book, I have a lot to say about the individual child —ways to think about problems with mood, behavior, attent ion and concentration, ways to help a child in these areas. The point I am really emphasizing just now, however, is that it is dangerous and harmful to reduce the dynamic interactional phenomena of our society's interface with young people to the biological psychopathology of children. Ch ildren have a hard time when thei r needs are not well met, when we have failed in our moral imper ative to provide an excellent at mosphere for them to grow and develop. As one focus of this book is what to do when your child is labeled a problem by the schools, it is important to give thought to schools in our society. The nature of oppression is to make us forget. John Taylor Gatto taught for 30 years, was New York City Teacher of the Year for two year s running, has unearthed and made public the history and philosophical underpinnin gs of our system of education. There are very many good, great teachers. Gatto’s work is about the systemic struct ure, not the teachers. Have you ever wondered how and why it is that we do education the way we do: compulsory attendance; rigidly defined curricula; age segregation; single adul t authority; brief class periods with rigid, frequent transitions; etc.? Have you thought a lot about what development goals the designers of such a system had in mind? Much was written in the late 1960s and early 1970s decrying the deleter ious effects of our compulsory education system. Writers such as John Holt, Paul Goodman and Jonathan Kozol detailed the damage our syst em does to young people. They sa w how this system was based on a factory model that promoted ef ficiency and productivity as the primary values. The system was needed to engineer a massive psychic shift from independent, land-based people to dependent town people reliant on jobs offe red by the captains of industry. Gatto's research shows how we adopted a Prussian model that was developed and proved effective fo r the intention of creating obedient soldiers and loyalists for the State. Leadi ng thinkers who developed the philosophy of the United States system of compulsory education were, fo r the most part, trained in Germany. Gatto quoted the theoretical writings of these men. They were very clear that the function of education was to instill primary va lues of obedience and ac quiescence to authority. In order to do so, the system was designed to enforce utter dependency and discourage original, independent thought. In short, according to Ga tto, the idea was to foster “ali enation from the individual's own soul.”"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 In retrospect and in the light of rhetoric pr aising independence and creat ivity, the words of these men seem appalling. The fa ct is, however, that our system continues to operate on these principles and the results continue to be devastating. Gatto's 1992 book, Dumbing Us Down , clearly describes primary effects of this type of education. He descr ibes our schools as inherently psychopathic ; rigid and systematic and constant interrupt ion of young people's self-directed work at 45-minute intervals shows a total lack of consci ence, sensitivity, awareness, and respect for the natural desires, inclinations and tendencies of unique individuals. The subtitle of Gatto's book, “ The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling ,” refers to seven lessons that he contends are t aught from Harlem to Hollywood Hills: 1. Confusion - Everything is out of context with constant viol ations of natural order and sequence. While it is the nature of human bei ngs to seek meaning and relatedness, what students get is disconnected facts and t he unrelatedness of everything. 2. Class Position - Students stay in the class where they belong, in good order, with their own kind. 3. Indifference - The lesson of bells is that no wo rk is worth finishing, so why care too deeply about anything. 4. Emotional Dependency - A comp rehensive system of rewards and punishments enforces dependency and teaches children to surrender their will. 5. Intellectual Dependency - The belief that good st udents wait for a teacher to tell them what to do says it all and is taught early on in our system. Success means doing assigned thinking, limiting ideas to received thought, sacr ificing original and independent thinking. 6. Provisional Self-Esteem - St udents are constantly evaluated and judged. Individual worth is not inherent, but clearly and cons tantly contingent on the evaluati ons of certified professionals. 7. One Can't Hide - Students are not allowed private spaces or private time; homework extends the system's surveill ance right into private homes. No one is unaffected by this process. It is import ant to understand that it is not the content that is really the problem; alterations of content don't ma ke a lot of difference. It is the method that is inexorable. I worked at Del Valle High School one semester, teaching a community college introductory psychology class for some of advanc ed students there. One of the counselors warned me on my first day there that this was very different from actually teaching at the college"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 as “the kids are captive here.” Ta ke a moment and contrast this with what the director of the Albany Freed Schoool, Chris Merc ogliano, typically says when asked about how his school works with so little structure and so mu ch apparent chaos: “We take no hos tages!” Everyone is there by choice. As Gatto concludes, “School is a 12-y ear jail sentence where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned.” It is no wonder that most of us carry massive self-doubt and have tremendous difficulty thinking independe ntly and challenging authority. Another factor contributing to this problem of crushed creativity and original thinking is propaganda. Leonard Frank (1995) incl udes a wonderful quotation from Aldous Huxley regarding what happened to a movement at the advent of Worl d War II intended to facilitate critical thinking and what he called “Propaganda Analysis.” Certain educators disapproved of the tracki ng of propaganda analysis on the grounds that it would make adolescents unduly cynical. Nor was it welcomed by the milit ary authorities, who were afraid that recruits might start to analyze the utterances of drill sergeants. And then there were the clergymen and advertisers. The cl ergymen were against propaganda analysis as tending to undermine belief and diminish churchgoi ng; the advertisers objected on the grounds that it might undermine brand lo yalty and reduce sales. (On the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, which was founded in t he United States in 1937 and folded in 1941, “Education for Freedom.”). It is instructive to combine Gatto's concept of the modern “psychopa thic” school with the BioPsychiatric concept of individual “psychopat hology.” I suggest the following conclusions as more valid than those of BioPsychiatry: • Psychopathology does not cause children to fail. • Psychopathic schools, having no conscienc e and insensitive to the needs and motivations of children, are a failure to children. What we call childhood psychopathology (e.g., AD HD) is a result. “Disruptive Behavior Disorders” are a distorted way of describing the effect, not the caus e, of a bankrupt philosophy of education. Schools and Shame"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" 42 A basic reality about sc hools is that the vast majority of young people have no choice about attendance. Home schooling is growing in this country , but for most families it is not an option; the same is true for other alternativ e modes of schooling. It is vitally important that parents find ways to protect children from the neg ative effects of our current education system. When Gatto was speaking in Austin, Texas, an audience member asked him what could be done to help a child who had to go to a traditional school. I will paraphrase Gatto's response, as his view is very much like my own. The thing about schools as we k now them is that they are guaranteed to violate a child's natural instinct for curious, ze stful, self-directed learning. The inherently psyc hopathic structure and scheduling of our schools, dictated by an industrially ordered adult society, cannot help but clash with a child's natural needs, inclinat ions and interests. Therefore, it is absolutely inevitable that somebody has to be wrong . That somebody is either the child or the school (and its representatives such as teacher, coach, or principal). We are not applying the word “ wrong ” in the sense of making a mistake; the issue goes much deeper than that. We are saying that either the child or the school is fundamentally flawed. Given the enormous dis parity in power, and children's natural tendency to experience themselves as re sponsible centers of t he universe, unprotected children will inevitably assume that they are defective for not fitting in. This unfortunate sense of self is often referred to as poor self -esteem. The emotional concept that one is fundamentally flawed or defective is called SHAME. It is an awful feeling. It makes one want to hide because it feels unbearable to be exposed. You hide . You don't speak out. You worry what others think. You feel miserable. Boredom There are many factors that contribute to ch ildren's experience of school-related shame, including Gatto's seven lessons outlined above and th e overall disruption of self-directed learning. I want to emphasize boredom now because I think we tend to underestimate just how stressful and suppressive boredom can be. In so doing, I am well aware of an apparent contradiction in this book, since I later challenge the demand for const ant stimulation and enter tainment. I argue that we need to slow life down for our children, to allow relaxed, quie t time and time in nature. I discuss the concept of “down time” as a necessary condition of withdrawal from overstimulation and as a space for incubation of creative expression. Here I present an opposite face, arguing that"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" 43 we need to stimulate and ch allenge our children; both are true. It is said in Buddhist tradition that the guardians of truth ar e paradox and confusion. So it appears with q uestions of time and activity. I came across a passage recently from the autobiography of Jacques Lusseyran, a man blinded in an accident at age 8 who as a teenager was a key leader of the underground French resistance of Nazi Germany in Wo rld War II. Lusseyran's story is amazing. At the same time that he was leading the resistance work , he studied an intense curriculum at the French lycÈe, or preparatory school. What follows are the words of Lusseyran: I have already said that for blind people there is such a th ing as moral odor, and I think that was the case at school. A group of human beings who stay in one room by compulsion — or because of social obligation which comes to the same thing — begins to smell. That is literally the case, and with children it happens even faster. Ju st think how much suppressed anger, humiliated independence, frustrated vagran cy and impotent curiosity can be accumulated by forty boys between the ages of ten and fourteen! So that was the source of the unpleas ant odor and the smoke which, for me, was like a physical presence in class. What I saw there was confusion; colors were faded and even dirty. The blackboard was black, the floor was black, the tables were black and so were the books. Even the teacher, in terms of light, was no mo re than gray. To be otherwise he had to be remarkable, not only for what he knew (learning in those days gave me little light) but remarkable as a person as well. Boredom bound and gagged all my senses . Even sounds in class lost their volume and their depth and went lifeless. Every bit of my passion for living was needed to stand the test . At bottom I must have lacked discipline, not making up my mind to rebel, but still an incorrigible individualist. That was certainly part of my ma ke-up, but then too there was blin dness and its special world, to which school was doing violence. I had to wait years , at least until adolescence, to quiet the scandal which started in side my head at school . I doubt whether I have made peace with it even now.

I underst ood that the teacher coul d not or did not wish to talk about what was going on inside him. That was his affair, and af ter all I was not anxious myself to talk about what went on in me. But the inner life was so much more than a personal thing. There were a thousand desires and goals my co mpanions shared with me, and I knew it. To accumulate knowledge was good and beautiful, but the reason for men to acquire it would have been more meaningful, and no one spoke of that. I could not help thinking that in t he whole business someone was cheating somewhere . I felt I had to defend myself, and I did so by mobilizing a ll the images of my inner world, all the ones bound up with living cr eatures or living things. Sitting on my dark chair in front of my sickening table, under the gray downpour of learning, I set myself to weavin g a kind of cocoon. Still, while I was a good boy I was sly, and m anaged it so that no one would guess I was hostile. This interior world of mine was so important to me that I was determined to prot ect it from shipwreck, and to rescue it I never stopped making concessions to t he public, to books, to my parents and teachers. I owe my brilliance as a student to this rescue operation. In order to be left in peace I undertook to learn everyt hing they wanted me to, Latin, entomology, geometry and the history of t he Chaldeans. I learned to type on an ordinary typewriter so I could hand my homework directly to the teachers like the others. Every day I carried my Braille typewriter to school, and put it on a felt cushion to deaden the sound, and then I took my notes. I listened, responded, listened, but was never in it heart and soul. As a boy I was cut in two. I was there and else where, always going and coming between the important and the meaningless. Now that the experience is behind me — the boredom thick as oil, t he moral curvature which lasted for years — I can see that I ow e them something, as the sign that some vital spirit in me refused to turn its back on childhood , and would never admit that truth was ready-made. There was no going back on it. I would never relinquish the sense of wonder I felt when I went blind. Even if there were not a book in the world to record it, I should still feel it.

He could not help but think that “s omeone was cheating somewhere;” this is the violation that leads to shame. “S ome vital spirit” in Lusseyran preva iled, after he “had to wait years to quit the scandal that started inside my head at school.” Even looking back as a university professor writing his autobiogr aphy, Lusseyran doubts he had made peace with it. Hopefully your child's school is more humane that the French l ycÈe; I don't know. I am sure, however, that the eloquent words of this brilliant blind man are still relevant. I hope they inspire you to think well and help protect your child from sh ame. The following dial ogue is intended to assist you toward this end. A Little Dialogue About Handling School Shame PARENT So, what can a parent do to give a child some protection from taking on this shame? JOHN Well, it's really tricky. What makes it tricky is that your child has to go to school and you don't want to spoil it for your child by judgi ng and condemning the people and place where you are sending her to grow and develop. You want your child to do well, enjoy learning, have excellent relationships with caring teachers, and be happy about getting up in the morning to go to school. Furthermore, you don't want to torment yourself with feelings of dread and guilt over this awful thing you are forcing on your child. PARENT So, come on already, what can a parent do? JOHN Well, it's really tricky. What makes it tricky is that you don't want to spoi l it for your child by making him into a victim. Yes, it is tricky, but you have an extremely fortuna te piece of information on your side that is rock-solid. You and your child are extremely in telligent and completely capable of handling the greatest of cha llenges. With good information and good support, together you can handle just about anything really well; that most definitely includes the challenge of school. PARENT All right already, would you pleas e get to the point. What can I do? "},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" 46 JOHN Bear with me. One more tricky part. I detect a little tension here; it's a good creative tension; carpe diem . Let's seize the day and use this tension to bring to life the challenging task of teaching independence and responsibility. What's tric ky is that you want to help your child and you want to foster your child's inde pendent handling of school as his responsibility. Just on that edge of tension in \"All right already, w hat can I do?\" is a great place to be, right on the dynamic edge of those perilous illusions to whic h we fall prey in struggling wi th independence and responsibility. Too much support? (Doing it for your child?) Too little support? (Abandoning your child on an unequal playing field?) Unresolved guilt? (Am I forc ing my poor baby to participate in an abusive situation?). A key point to remember is that y ou need support to process these tense feelings. You're doing a great job and you deserve support. The attitude to r each for and embrace is one of relaxed confidence , for yourself and for your child. Once again , the absolute truth is that your child is completely intelligent and capable of handling life's challe nges—with your best thinking, support, encouragement and active involvement as ally. PARENT OK, but you still haven't told me what I can do to protect my child from shame. JOHN My apologies for going on and on. The biggest thi ng, really, is that there is no formula. The greatest wisdom, and perhaps the greatest contr adiction to our educational heritage of the received thought of others, is that you really can TRUST YOUR OWN THINKING. Get support for thinking out loud as you figure it out, and know t hat your child and your situation are unique. Beyond this, here is Gatto's point. What you nee d to do is to give your child a buffer or shield for protection against personally taking on the inevit able failures of school to support her inherent nature and self-direc ted learning. What you need to do is to figure out a way to let y our child know that yes, there is something wrong, but not with you! I hope you understand why I needed such a le ngthy preamble to this deceptively simple advice. Your child needs to know that there are problems with ho w schooling is done; that his or her feelings are understandable; that it's regrettable we don't have a better alternative; that it's not the child's fault. To have such an enlightened witness can make al l the difference for a child and prevent the shame from penetrating quite as deeply into a child's core."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":" 47 To communicate this well requires great cr eativity and flexibility in th inking. It requires being sensitive to children's thinking and development; it is important to give information according to their need, not your own. Your judgments about the school may not correlate very well with your child's experience. Most important is that f eeling attitude of relaxed confidence! Your child is great. She'll do well. Together, you'll handle whatever co mes up, whatever it takes. Mi stakes are OK. Children don't need perfect parents. Your child needs a really good, involved, imper fect parent. You're the one. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":" 48 Chapter 3 Schools Continued: A Few Ideas This book is not primarily about education. In this brief secti on, I simply offer a few ideas that have proven helpful over the years. My personal view aligns with those who deeply value self-directed learning. As described in the previous chapter, Gatto’s work reveals the ot her-directed structure of our educational system. Many of the two-million home schooling children in our country are learning at home because their parents are determined to let their children set their own educational age nda. The rhetoric of many “alternative” schools is all a bout self-directed learni ng. Schools vary in their ability to match reality with rhetoric, but there are some very good ones out there. In another of my books, True Nature and Great Misunderstandings, I describe two—the Albany Free School and the Austin Montessori School—that do real ly well in that regard. Many great teachers heroically try to give children some authority even in the face of a structure that demands sa meness and conformity. No easy solution here, but it definitely helps to know that one core quality of inherent human nature is se lf-determination. When Chris Mercogliano is asked to describe his Albany Free Sc hool, the first thing that very often comes out of his mouth is, “We take no hostages.” Contrast this with the comment made to me two years ago when I was teaching a community college psychology cl ass for upper level students at one of the area high schools. A school counsel or pointed out to me that, “T he students are captives.” He really wanted me to understand the effect of this, and I do. I also learned a related aphorism years ago from psychologist and author Arnold Mindell, of the Process Work Center in Portland, Oregon, that has been very useful to me: “Unfair use of rank causes revenge.” It seems many young people consider it unfair to make them go to school against their will. Tough job. Chapter___, “Working with chall enging young people in schools and other inst itutions,” holds a few ideas that are directly relev ant to this structural dynamic. Small is Beautiful: Class and School Size There is one very simple way to help promot e and allow more self-direc ted learning, and at the same time impact other difficulties. I think cla ss size is hugely important . Smaller classes allow more attention, greater flexibility, more slack to deal with unique indi viduals. Similarl y, school size"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":" 49 is a crucial variable. We tend to almost take t hese huge schools for granted as inevitable. Not so. It is as if the gradual trend of doing away with small schools a nd creating these huge schools with vast bureaucracies was not just that—a systematic change, driven by policymakers form above. It used to be the main cost of a school was the t eacher; today, building and administrative costs are a gigantic portion of the budget. Ther e are very many adults working in schools that have nothing to do with teaching, and I do not think the schools are better fo r it. I am far from alone in my conviction that when it comes to schools, small is beautiful. I highly value the notion of being a big fish in a small pond. Please see John Gatto’s book, The Underground History of Modern American Education, for a full story about how schools came to be the way they are. LD and DBD: A Big Excuse There has been an amazing increase in the number of children labeled as learning disabled (LD) or diagnosed with “disruptive behavior disor ders” (DBD). These children are generally placed in special education. Federal legi slation in the early 1960s created a big push for the growth of special education, spending reac hing $1 billion in 1977; by 1994 th is was a $30 billion industry. The 1991 expansion of the Individuals with Dis abilities Education Act (ID EA) to include so-called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) as a qualifying disa bility was a huge spark in this growth. A key to understanding this incredible phenomenon is that the original intenti on of federal efforts to meet the needs of physically handicapped children with objective disabilit ies, like hearing and visual problems, has been systematically broadened to include ever more subjective diagnoses, such as non-specific learning disabilities and ADD. It is absolutely asto unding that today about 60% of children qualifying under IDEA have no verifiable phy sical disability. These children are selected solely on the basis of subjecti ve criteria, given labels such as LD, ADD or ED (emotionally disturbed). Could it be that these diagnoses are a m odern way of “blaming the victim?” It seems to me that labels like LD and ADD serve to justif y our school and community failures to meet our children’s real educational needs, and absolve us adults from responsibility to figure out and make the necessary changes to meet those needs. A Note on Reading There are, of course, m any dimensions of need for children—th is book addresses a few. In our educational system, one necessary condition for succ ess stands out above all— the ability to read. Illiteracy is an absolute guarantee of school failure . And in our rigid age-graded curriculum, failure"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" 50 to keep up with expected reading levels will usually result in an LD diagnosis and special education placement by age 7 or 8. In my view, this is terribly wrong as many children, often boys, are not interested or ready to re ad until age 8 or even later—yet alr eady they are a failure, a child with “special needs,” labeled LD or ADD, and generally turned off to school. This is very sad, and one big reason so many home school. Many today point to the colossal failure of so-called whole language le arning. As an example, they point to California, where the literacy rate in schools dr opped dramatically as a result of wholesale implementation of whol e language reading instruction in the 1990s. It seems that basic phonics instruction works much better. Progr ams like Sam Blumenfeld’s Alphaphonics (http://www.howtotutor.com/) are r eadily available and simple to im plement at home or school. To my mind it certainly makes sense to look at r eading failure as an underlying cause of a child’s hard time in school, and to ensure they get the basics of phonics as a foundation. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" 51 Study Technology Children are born able to learn with unbeliev ably absorbent minds. I love this quote from John Holt’s book, How Children Fail: Nobody starts off stupid. You have only to watch babies and infants, and think seriously about what all of them l earn and do, to see that, except fo r the most grossly retarded, they show a style of life, and a desir e and ability to learn, that in an older person we might call genius. Hardly an adult in a thousand, or ten t housand, could in any three years of his life learn as much, grow as much in his underst anding of the world around him, as every infant learns and grows in his first three years. But what happens, as we get older, to this extraordinary capacity for lear ning and intellectual growth? (p. 273) The question of why so much failure and str uggle in schools is the source of countless books. Writers such as John Taylor Gatto, John Holt, Ma ria Montessori, Rudolf Stei ner, are full of wisdom on education. I barely even scratch that surface, but I do want to share a teaching about study technology that has been quite helpful. It is the basis of the work of Applied Scholastics (http://www.appliedscholastics.org/), an educational resources group. Their study technology is largely based on three simple ideas considered keys to learning. These are the concepts of mass, gradient and misunderstood word. Mass refers to somethi ng you can get your eyes and ha nds on, that you can physically demonstrate, that gets you beyond purely abstract ideas or princi ples into concrete manipulation and demonstration. The notion is very simple—you can read a book or listen to the very best lecture about how to ride a bike, but unless y ou see and touch and m anipulate and get on and pedal, you will never learn about bikes. Getting “mass” on a subject of study is considered a basic necessity of learning. Gradient refers to the idea that learning bu ilds on itself, and that a good way to create failure in a student is to teach something for which the necessary prerequisites are missing. The use of training wheels on a bike woul d demonstrate a graded approach to bike riding. Baking an elaborate soufflé when you’ve never cr acked an egg would likely be a disaster. "},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" 52 The third concept in this trilogy of st udy technology, the misunderst ood word, is of profound importance. The teaching is that one of the main reasons people fail to learn or give up on a course of study is because they have gone past a word they do not understand. The very strong recommendation is never to go past a word you do not understand. Use a dictionary! He looked upon his couchant son. If you are not clear on the meaning of the word couchant , this sentence will not communicate its message. Continuing on without su ch clarity leads to confusion and loss of interest. Learn that couchant means “lying down with the head up” and the mind beco mes clear, and attention and energy pick up. One does not lear n well with holes in m eaning and understandin g. Remediation of learning difficulties or discouragement should incl ude a systematic search for prior concepts in the relevant area that were missed or not clearly l earned by the student. Getting clear on this missing data is a huge, necessary step in reclaiming one’ s natural ability and zest for learning. Homework Any discussion of schools and earning ought to at least wei gh in on the subject of homework. It is my ongoing observation that many young people are overly burdened with homework. I think this is an issue on all levels as I have seen m any stressed-out, over-tired teenagers hit the wall, often in so-called middle school, where a good percentage, close to 1/3 in my observations, struggle and, to varying degrees, experience failure. In this brief commentary, however, I want only to focus on elementary school. We are not talking about a half hour of reading. These y oung children very often rece ive a very great deal of homework; it is not unusual to se a 7 or 8-y ear-old spending 2-3 hours a night on homework. In my view, this is terribly wrong for two reasons. Fi rst, there is no evidence that all this homework enhances learning, which is, of c ourse, the claim to virtue for giving the children this onerous burden. If this claim is false, then what is the r eal reason? Following Gatto’s lead on the 7 lessons of compulsory education, I suppo se it might be that school and learning are not enjoyable, but a burden, that life is about doi ng busy work for others. I have also frequently observed another troubling phenomenon related to homework—parents pitted against their children in tense, angry, su llen conflicts about homewor k. To my parenting"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":" 53 mind and heart, this is tragic—the little time left in da y to be with your beloved child is lost in a tense struggle! The schools have our children for 8 hours a day—that is enough. I don’t like it that parents are pressured to serve as after hours agent s for the schools. Especially with our young children, the rest of the day shou ld be for play and free choice of activity. And we adults deserve to be enjoying our little ones, and having fun with them! Recess Speaking of play, how many of you remember recess at school—a chance to take a break, run around, talk, and play with your friends? How many of you, like me, have seen the impending death of recess in the schools? Extraneous, expendable. Taken away as control or punishment. Very often, I see recess taken away from the restless child who needs it most. Talk about a teacher shooting himself in the foot! I strongly advise that recess be valued as much as reading, holding a treasured, unalterable place in the daily schedule—not optional, not a rewa rd, but a simple and necessary given. This is common sense. Yet it is a common sense so distort ed by our high stress, pr essured world, that I want to end this chapter with a long excerpt from my book, True Nature and Great Misunderstandings : Adults tend to be very serious about work. Children can be very serious about their own work, reacting intensely when it is dist urbed or doesn’t go right. To be the best ally for children, it is necessary to be crystal clear about the following: The work of children is play. Play is their work. It is not a waste of time. It is not unproductive. It is not somethi ng to grow out of. Play is about learning and power. It is about working out upsets. It is most especially about connection, for our children and us. Children connect in play, and they work out difficulties in connection thorough play. If we want to know the delights and pleasures of real intimacy with our children (and all of life), we best follow their example and be sure that we can play."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":" 54 Joseph Chilton Pearce has spent a large part of his life trying to figure out children, and defending play. In writing his most famous work, Magical Child , he spent months grappling with the question of why children want to play all the time, from birth on, while we adults have such a different agenda for them. As he describes in his latest book, The Biology of Transcendence , his intense query caused him to experience this truth: “I knew that play was the whole reason for and essence of life—and not just for children, but for all God’s chil dren, whatever their age; and I understood that our great model’s [Jesus] observation that we must become again as little children meant precisely what it sa id. But I also knew that our refu sal to play and our prevention of play in children, our insistenc e on forcing them into defensive procedures, were evils of long standing.” (p. 181) For support in understanding more about the im portance of play, and for support to help adults reclaim the ability to play, I strongly recomm end the works of Patty Wipfler and her Parents Leadership Institute (www.par entleaders.org), and the book, Playful Parenting , by Lawrence Cohen. Lest this remain an intellectual concep t, I also recommend the resources of the Re- Evaluation Counseling Community (www.rc.org) as on e place that provides real experiences in the form of playdays and family workshops; I am one individual who will testify that this community helped me enormously as a parent with my own children. "},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":" 55 CHAPTER 4 An Alternative 3 Rs Tammy Cox, dire ctor of The Redirection Connection in Austin, Texas, proposed these alternative 3 Rs: Respect, Responsibility and Relati onship. A woman of great spirit and thought, Tammy's mission is to educate adults in the ways of democratic, respectful parenting and child- raising. I believe that a clear understanding of these three c oncepts helps ensure a rich and successful experience as adults and young people grow toget her. What follows is my attempt to help create this clear understanding and attitude. Respect Complete and unqualified respect is and must be the foundation stone of any mutually satisfying relationship, and must be the basis from which we enter into relationships with our children. Without it, we all inevitably end up in humiliation and disgrace . As I said above, the pattern of adultism is one of massive disrespect. I think adultism — treating young people with less than complete respect—is grounded in a fundamental distortion in how we see and experi ence the nature of the world and especially the nature of human beings. In the following sections (especially t hat on relationship), I have included suggestions to help you correct this distorted per ception. For now, it is enough to say that we carry a heavy load of shame about our nature and a horrible wound from being torn apart from our naturally complete interconnectedne ss with all of life. The sum total of our experience has resulted in an awful misunderstanding about the nature of being human. Incredi bly, we are pulled to view our children as inherently lazy, ir responsible, stupid and manipulative in the worst sense of these words. So we justify disrespectful attempts to c ontrol or punish them as necessary to shape them properly or correct their brutish, natural tendencies; all this is done “for their own good,” of course. Children are already completely good, just as, by nature, are you. All of us are born good, always have been good, and are good now. Anything else is a result of having been hurt. You will see in the next section on responsib ility that I do not equate permissiveness with respect. It is useful to view children as comi ng into the world with great intelligence, but with equally great lack of information and experience in t he ways of the world. Furthermore, there is an"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" 56 obvious, dramatic inequity in size and power. So being a parent is a tremendous responsibility, and we need all the help we can get. Developing is a tremendous challenge for young people. They need all the help we can provide — thoughtful, well-consid ered help, tempered by a good understanding of human nature and development. Just now, I want to offe r four suggestions in thinking about re spect. First and foremost, always remember that your child, however small and dependent, however emotionally vehement about his frustrating and helpless condition, is not only what he appears to be as a little, needy, emotional human animal. S he is, in essence, a vast spirit ual being undergoing the immensely challenging task of learning to live and master the ways of being in a physical body in this physical world. I offer the wisdom of Kahlil Gibran, from The Prophet , as a reminder: And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children. And he said: Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you ye t they belong not to you. You may give them your lo ve but not your thoughts, For their souls dwell in the house of to morrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your childr en as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness; For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable. Let's replace adultism with awe. My next three suggestions form a set of in terrelated basic teachings about respect. A frequent complaint of parents, and one whic h we all experience at times and to varying degrees, is that, in Rodney Daingerfield's famous tr ademark, “We Get No Respect!” “My child is impolite, rude,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" 57 disrespectful, etc. to me! He be tter learn respect.” “If she expect s me to treat her with respect, she's going to have to show me some respect.” This ubiquitous phenomenon offers a great focal point for clarification a bout respect and parenting. The second teaching I offer is this: The way to teach respect is to give it . The only way your child will learn the true meaning and experience of respect is through being consistently treated with respect. Please know here that the type of l earning to which I refer is not a disembodied, conceptual-intellectual knowledge; it is a learning at the core of one's beingness about respect as the natural order of one' s inner and outer worlds. Our job as parents specifically, and as human beings in general, is to do whatever it takes to heal and release our cynicism and move into a place of Sacred Respect for ourse lves, our children, our world. The next teaching follows naturally. It is the nature of human beings that we come into the world expecting (experienced parents know that “ demanding” is a more appropriate word here!) to be treated with complete respect. Anything less nat urally evokes outrage and indignation. Imagine a 2-year-old child standing in the middle of your living room with a glass of juice. You notice her and she spills some on your newly cleaned, beautiful r ug. Without even thin king, you naturally react; words come out of your mouth something like \"Daughter, you know better!\" or worse, or simply \"Daughter!\" Difficult to co nvey on paper, but essential to my point here, is that the words per se are less important than the t one and energy of your voice. Th ink about it and you will know whether there was an edge, or more than an edge, of shame (accusatory judgment, disgust, disrespect ) in your reaction. What's interesting is this. A child who has al ready been sufficiently co wed by fear and shame may very well respond timidly and fearfully to your reaction, pe rhaps obeying and moving off the rug, perhaps dropping the glass in startled fear. A child who ha s not been shamed, however, will very likely respond something like this. Imagine th at two-year-old again. Sh e hears your voice and her body naturally reacts with a startle. She does not cow and comply, however. Rather, she regains her composure and looks at you defiantly. Then, lookin g you right in the eye, she ceremoniously pours out the rest of the juice on your precious rug! Raising a child to be proud and to know their inherent worth often does not make parenting easy. In fact, it seems to force an ongoing process of humble acknowledgment and working"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" 58 through of the places we've bee n hurt, where we carry shame and are overcome by patterns of disrespect. Tammy Cox summarized this particular teaching for me in these words: It is more important for your child to defy and resist disrespec tful efforts to control him than it is to have things work well in his life . Self-respect and autonomy are very high prioriti es in the order of yo ur child's existence; order and flow in worldly affair s are most definitely a notch lo wer in the hierarchy of needs. Understanding this point will go a long way in understanding your ex perience as a parent. It also explains a great deal about young people's so-called “rebellion” in our society. It may feel like a sad truth, but that sadness is really a grief ca rried over many years from the ways we were suppressed as children. The truth is that our young people's resistance is cause for celebration. We cannot control our children, but t hey will respond well to our respect. With respect as the basis of our relationship, they may at times accept, and at the very least consider, our stumbling efforts to provi de them with loving guidance. The final teaching I offer here goes deep into the heart of that oft en anguishing phenomenon of being treated “badly” by our ch ildren. I choose the word “badly” and put it in quotes to bring attention. “Bad” needs to be seen clearly for what it is: a judgment in the language of shame. Such a judgment has only negative value as a motivato r for responsive parenting; it can only bring trouble in our relationships with our children. It is useful only as a signal to activate our own “shame sirens” and help us work on healing our own shame. Your child is not bad. She is showing you so mething — a place where it is hard and she needs to work. And do you know what? As so often is the case, it is very likely true that things are not even close to what they appear to be. A great teacher of mine emphasiz ed over and again that things are fundamentally upside down and backwards in the outer world. Whether this makes sense to you or not, whether you belie ve it or not, it is worth consid ering in various situations that are presented in everyday life. In the case of your disrespectful ch ild, I am suggesting that much of the time, bad does indeed mean good! Let me explain. The core of this teaching is about SAFETY. We are inevitably hurt as we go about living in this world. Children are inevitably hurt (treated with disrespect, rejected , frustrated, made to do things"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 59 they don't want to do, etc.) as they go about t heir lives. Fortunately, we humans have a built-in mechanism for healing from these hurts that has to do with emot ional expression. The hurts do not just go away; they must be healed and releas ed by expression. And guess what? Safety is required for that expression to take place. Childr en are extremely intelligent; they quickly learn to suppress their expression if it is going to lead to greater hurts. So who is the most likely candidate fo r safest person in a child's life? You are. That disrespectful \"bad\" behavior is very often a child's attempt to, in effect, use you as a counselor. Their \"bad\" behavior, then, may best be interpret ed as a wonderful acknowle dgment that you are a safe haven for them to show where they're hav ing difficulty, release their frustrations and discharge their rejections by acting this out on you. It feels like hell at times, but it really is an honor. God knows we all need a lot of help with it, but it is a great gift you give your child. By allowing her to use you as a counselor this way, you are helping your chil d enjoy the world outside your home. How many of you have shaken y our heads in wonder at another adult's comments (especially during a time when your child is challenging you big-time at home) about how wonderful, thoughtful, considerate, mature and well-behaved your child was in their presence? Amazing. Responsibility The first key in thinking about responsibility is to remember that children are inherently responsible. Young people nat urally view themselves as the c enter of the universe and assume that whatever happens is because of them. This is why, beyond any direct attributions by the perpetrator, an abused child feels gu ilty and blames himself for the abuse. Bad things happen to me; therefore I must be bad. A view of childr en as inherently irresponsible and needing to be taught responsibility is dangerous; adul t perceptions and expectations exert a powerful influence on young people's self-image and behavio r. Children don't need to be trained to be responsible, but they do need information and guidanc e, opportunity and encouragement. The second key is based on the simple truth that what you do far outweighs what you say. As the old proverb goes, “Actions Speak Louder Than Words”; the be st way to teach your child responsibility is to be responsible. As you model responsibility, you provide a family environment in which your child will thrive. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":" 60 The third key is this: You teach a child responsibil ity by giving him responsibility. Better said, a young person learns to express her inherent natural responsibility in this world by being given responsibility. A trust is given, an expectati on is conveyed, encouragements are ever-present, support and understanding are available when the going gets hard and frustrating. Not only is it our inherent nature to be respons ible, but it truly spoils us to be denied the opportunity to develop and express this gift. L. Ron Hubbard, father of Dianetics, proposes that natural law involves energy exch ange. You can't really just give something away; you can't really just take something. To attempt to do so corrupt s our nature, inducing false pride in the giver and false entitlement in the taker. It seems to me that this is one law that pr ovides a particularly challenging experience for parents. I maintain that the par ent-child relationship is unique because, in many respects— economically, structurally, and em otionally—it is truly one-way. This unique relationship between parents and chil dren is natural and inevitable. Human beings require a long period of absolute dependency; failure to provide for this results in the kinds of lifelong dependency so pervasi ve in our society today. However, it is our job as parents to recognize that our children need and want responsib ility and to provide experiences and support appropriate to their age level and maturity to help them master th e ways of this world. My friend Donna Goertz referred to this learning as a spir itual incubation period, a natural extension of physical incubation in the womb. I confess that my thinking about responsibilit y has been confused. As most people, I had learned to view responsibility as a burden, a pressu re, a dreadful obligation. This has colored my experience as a parent. As a result, all too o ften I have seen my family through the eyes of resentment rather than the glorio us “Eyes of Delight.” In so doing, I have missed out on the daily gifts my children offer. My challenge now, and I ex tend this challenge to all of you, is to fully embrace my role as a parent, not as an obligati on, but as one of the greatest opportunities and contributions a man can make. I give to my ch ildren with open heart. I ta ke delight in their presence. I willingly sacrifice. I allow myself to be imperfect, and I get support from others during my inevitable emotional upheavals. I know what an incredibly ha rd job parenting is, and maybe some day I'll get some rest ! "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":" 61 One word of caution to parents: We get stuck in our attempts to parent well in places where we have “frozen needs” (unmet dependen cy needs from our own childh oods). We are unconsciously pulled to look to our children to help us heal from the hurts of these unmet needs. However, our responsibility as adults is to seek counseling and support elsewhere. Do not expect your children to meet your emotional needs; your job is to meet theirs . Relationship Respect, responsibility and relationship are all in ter-related. Respect is the foundation of all relationship, and responsibility is the ongoing action that maintains the relationship. Throughout this book I emphasize the personal relationship betwe en parent and child. I am aware that I do not address what we usually refer to as our “relations hip,” our primary signifi cant other. I know how profoundly children are affected by the quality of their par ents' relationship. We must, married or not, do everything within our power to make this good, to be loving and cooperative co-parents for our children. In this section, however, I urge you to glimpse the bigger pictur e of your child's life. Our children have and need us as parents, but t hey also have extended families and friends, communities of people, plants, animals, the waters, the air, the trees, the earth and sky. It is our job as parents to hold a big enough s pace for all of this in our children's development and to help them be in relationship with all these forms of life and with the spirit wh ich sustains us all. In order to most effectively help our young people, we must get really cl ear about where we stand, which, in our modern world, feels like extremely shaky ground. The fundamental root of our problem with relationship is that we are out of balance wit h the natural order of our existence. We are living in the midst of a shar ed delusion that I call “consensua l madness.” This means that we have created and allow ourselves to live in a world of massive disorder. Nucl ear proliferation, war and famine, desertification and pollution and other forms of environmental degradation shape our daily lives. We inhabit a world in which masses of people live in decaying urban centers. Human beings are wonderfully loving, highly intelligent creatures. It is a gr eat violation of the human spirit that we give toxic, mood-alteri ng drugs to hundreds of thousands of our precious children. Things have to be seriously out of balance for this to occur. Chellis Glendinning wrot e a book recently with a powerfully evocative title, one that, if you allow, will resonate as truth inside your body: My Name Is Chellis and I'm in Recovery from Western Civilization . Her thesis, with which I obviously agree, is that simply by virtue of living in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" 62 today's disjointed, alienat ed, frenetic society, we are all to some degree suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress. Most of us feel like the proverbial “strangers in a world we never made.” It is difficult, when we feel so much like passive victim s, to reclaim our power and our responsibility to act consciously for ourselves, fo r our children, and for our planet. So how do we move toward a ri ght experience of relationship? It is important to realize that any attempt to do so will unavoidably bring us face to face with the intense psychological conditioning that forms the basis of the diso rdered and imbalanced existence we see today. My clear conviction is that, as with any teaching we wish to offer our childre n, we must become the teaching (or at least be open to and involved in th e process of becoming the teaching) in order to pass it on. We convey to our children who we ar e. A good beginning is to explore the conditioning that affects us so deeply. Our Philosophical Soil We can go back just a bit in history to the 16t h Century time of the Inqu isition and to the horrific torture and killing of women as witches. A guiding theology set b ody and nature apart from soul and attacked women as embodiments of sinful nat ure. The official cosmology can be briefly summarized. Heaven and the angels in perfection we re at the distant per imeter. Human beings, flawed and fallen creatures, were at the bottom of the univers e. Earth was the cesspool of creation; the lowest level was Hell, the c enter of the Earth. An image from Dante's Divine Comedy may be used to highlight the situat ion; the precise center of the universe and of Hell was Satan's anus, frozen forever. This is the soil out of which our environmental cr isis has grown. Human beings are fallen sinners, guilty and ashamed. The Harvest Environmental degradation, ecol ogical disasters, global warming, polluted air, fouled waters, overflows of toxic wastes, nuclear proliferation and radiation po isoning, pesticide and chemical intrusion at every level of our fo od chain, planet desertification, er adication of our rain forests, a shrinking biodiversity with daily extinction of species—the lis t goes on and on and is all too familiar. This is a huge share of the harvest grown from t he ground of Dante's Divine Comedy . It is the fulfillment of a prophe cy; it has become “the cesspool of creation.” "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" 63 The age of reason and its scientific revolution gradually replaced theology as our primary way of viewing the world. Un fortunately, this view led us to deny our animal nature. Judeo-Christian attitudes about humans and nature transferred very well to the new scientific paradigm. If anything, the insults of Copernicu s, that Earth was not the center of the Universe, and of Darwin, that humans were not specially created, only provided fuel for the fire. As the age of Newton provided the possibility, Americ an historian Theodore Roszak, in his book on EcoPsychology, The Voice of the Earth (1992), persuasively argues that industri al progress could only and still can only foul the Earth since its guiding pr inciples are so inherently m ad. To quote Roszak, “The species that destroys its own habitat in pursuit of false values , in willful ignorance of what it does, is ‘mad’ if the word means anything.” (p. 68) Restoration to sanity requir es a radical reordering of the consensual madness. I have already said much about the incr edibly distorted worldview of BioPsychiatry and its reduction of human beings to a soulless physio-c hemical-mechanical existence. The history of psychology is also understandably ske wed; how could it not be, giv en the philosophical soil out of which it grew? How could it not be, given the recent historical realities of the I ndustrial Revolution? I am laying groundwork here necessary for an effect ive response to the question of how to move toward a healthy experience of balance and orde r in relationship. I believe the growing development of what we call EcoP sychology is part of our answer. The Heart of EcoPsychology The heart of EcoPsychology involves a colossal re -ordering of our inherited understanding and experience of human nature. We began the recent history of Wester n society from a ground of Judeo-Christian theology in which human beings were shameful, fallen sinners living in the cesspool of creation. In this view, the only hope for clear, clean, saving energy was by a God who was “wholly other,” separate from nature and separate from our own natural bodies. The age of scientific reason only transferred this core state of sin to a denatur ed objectivity; the technological revolution provided incredible means to feed this consensual delusi on that we are separate from nature. The recent blips in our planet's history, which Roszak calls City Pox, are “declarations of wishful biological i ndependence from the natural environment. . . the modern city. . . the ancient dream of a totally encapsulated ex istence free of disease, dependency, the dirt and discomfort of organic life, perhaps even finally of death” (Roszak, pp. 219-220). No wonder this is the result"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 64 when reared on a vision that we are fallen sinners or mere accidents in a random mechanistic universe, “strangers and afraid in a world we never made.” Psychology developed in the contex t of a shift in worldview from theology to science, the main assumptions about human nature remaining intact. T he task of socialization (formerly salvation) was to harness or tame or civilize the unruly forc es of our inherently danger ous animalistic drives or instincts (fallen sinners in foul bodies). The best to hop e for was adequate adjustment to consensual reality, which was not to be questi oned. So human nature wa s fundamentally flawed (original sin). More and more people today are beginning to r ealize the truth about human beings—that our nature is inherently good, innocent, caring, compassionate, intelligent and completely worthy. This is a great step for psychology, but it is still a long way from EcoPsychology. Psychology still has incredible difficulty seeing its way out of a huge and fundamental error. It is like the fish knowing the nature of its water. Modern psychological theory is and always has been an artifact of urban- industrial life. It was built on the premise of an autonomous psyc he (soul), independent not only from its surroundings but from its own body. Some psychological theories have reclaimed the body. Others have gradually expanded a relational worl d to include first the mother, then others, but almost always only humans. With no place fo r non-human life, we live and develop apart from the natural world. Roszak agrees that this is the fundamental error of psychology. This apartness is the essence of our consensual madness. Furthermore, as fish can do little about foul ed water, psychotherapy in urban-industrial office buildings is inherently lim ited in its ability to rest ore human beings to their rightful minds. Roszak returns to his beloved Ro mantic poets for inspirat ion and to another poet, Thomas Traherne, who predated them by two generations: All mine! And seen so easily! How great, How Blest! How soon am I of all possest! My Infancie no sooner Opes its Eyes, But Straight the Spacious Earth Abounds with Joy Peace Glory Mirth And being Wise,"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":" 65 The very Skies, And Stars do mine becom; being all possest Even in that Way that is the Best! (p. 298) The environment that matters mo st is not the one we construct for our children; it is the one given them by nature. EcoPsychol ogy is grounded in the reality t hat human beings are not apart from nature by theological design or cosmic error. Nature contains us and, borrowing a Native American expression, each of us is born with a capacity to expe rience awe and wonder for “All my relations.” Our task is to reclaim or redevelop this natural capacity and to protect and nurture its reality for our children. From this place flows an enduring and abundant spring of clear, clean motivation as we live in our natural state of connectedness, of cari ng, of compassion, of love and reverence, knowing beyond any doubt that all life is sacred. It is undoubtedly true that, as parents, we must do our best to ensure that our children experience a relationship with us , their primary caregivers, that is nurturing, comforting, encouraging, affectionate, delightful, completely close, fully human in the best sense. Much of this book, and certainly most of par enting/child-rearing gui dance, stresses the importance of the human bond between parent and child. We know its power and significance. Chellis Glendinning and Roszak and the theor y of EcoPsychology remind us, however, that it is not enough to be the best lover and provider fo r your children. In order to respond to the challenge of being pressured to drug your child for “ADHD,” you must first recognize what is really going on with BioPsychiatry and education and drugging ch ildren. In order to gu ide your child into a healthy experience of relationship, it is necessary first to recognize what is really going on with modern urban-industrial existence, to see and accept and feel the truth of Chellis Glendinning's teaching that we are all suffering some degree of chronic post-traum atic stress by virtue of living in a world out of balance. We must recognize and feel and respond to the reality of being torn apart from our natural relationship of co mplete interdependence. We must recover from our family of origin childhood wounds and make progress in treating ou r children well and with great respect. We must also move into “Recovery From Western Civilization” and learn or re-learn a respect that knows that all life is sacred. As awkward as it may feel, we must strive to know and experience complete connectedness with the natur al world.

"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" 67 CHAPTER 5 Remembrances as Keys to Parent Heaven Remember to Relax Let go of any sense of urgency and pressure. Such feelings stem from adult fear and the need to avoid even more disturbing feelings of guil t, inadequacy, and loss of control. These are adult responses that have nothing to do with your child. Remember that you have all the time in the world . You are committed to and involved with your child for the long haul. Reme mber the big picture, even as y ou sometimes struggle to make it through one day at a time: You and your chil d, working it out together, forever. Remember also that these Disruptive B ehavior Disorders are “funny diseases.” They often disappear at the end of a school day or a school y ear. Present with one teac her, they mysteriously go into remission with another teac her. You have many years to watch your child grow and change as he develops and matures. Remember the True Nature of Your Child Children are neither small adults nor untrai ned animals needing to be disciplined and shaped. They are young human beings with enormous dependency needs. Co mpletely dependent on adults for survival and proper development, ch ildren need abiding protec tion, nurturance and encouragement. Remember that the inherent nature of children is that they are exceedingly intelligent, zestful, loving, and cooperative . Children are born with an expectation that caring adults will respond to their needs in a good, loving, thoughtful way. Please do not allow this trust to be violated! Remember also, and remember we ll, that our nature is that we are completely connected with all of life ! An ancient Chinese saying is that in pluc king a blade of grass, one strokes the stars. The ecological concept is calle d interdependence. There is an absurdly simple way to refute our cultural notion of rugged inde pendence, of pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps, of not needing anybody or anything. Simply ask this perso n or yourself to stop breathing. There is no getting around the simple truth that in living we are inextricab ly and unavoidably interdependent"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" 68 with all of life. This is our true nature. To act as if it were different, to hold a vision of anything less than this profound and simple truth, is to violate our children's trust. Remember to have great empathy for your child; she has taken on a tremendous task. The early years of learning to be in this body in this world are a prof ound challenge. Steven and Ondrea Levine, in their 1995 book, Embracing The Beloved: Relations hip as a Path of Awakening , remind us of a saying in the Sufi tradition that “T his is not a world of my making or even of my choosing, but this is the world into which I am born to find the Beloved.” The Levi nes go on to say that: Few would choose this realm of impermanence and holding as a rest stop, but many have discovered its value as a classroo m. Birth is our painful initiati on into the often awkward realm of relationship and dualit y. Sliding sideways into whatever niche is av ailable in the family matrix we attempt to fit our whole ghost into an ever-shifting world of people and things, of liking and disliking, of gain and loss. Born into a realm where most have denied happiness, clinging to momentary enjoyment, we often w ander hopelessly between pleasure and pain, at times unable to distinguish bet ween the two. (pp. 109-110) Have great compassion for yourself and for your child. We tend to think of ourselves as human beings seeking a spiritual experience. As usual, the truth seems to be op posite and upside down from the appearance of things. Jacquie Sm all passed on this teaching to me: We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; rather , we are spiritual beings having a human experience. Consider that this may be the true nature of your child. Parenting is a tough job. We need to keep the big picture in mind as we grappl e with the endless details and challenges. Remember the Importance of Mo vement and Physical Activity Remember how important movement and physical activity is to your developing child. This is such an integral aspect of your child’s true nature that it deserves a section of its own. Our bodies are meant to move; this is es pecially important with children. Physiolog ical and neurological development requires incredibly high levels of physical activity, from the infant’s need to be"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" 69 carried in arms to the baby's crawling, the t oddler’s exploring and all the way through our development. Preschoolers and early school age children need to move, a lot. I personally recommend the martial arts as an ac tivity for young people. My own children have benefitted enormously from participation in kara te. When properly taught, karate provides a wonderfully integrative experience of mind, body and spir it. On the physical level, flexibility, agility and power are developed. Emotional ly, self-confidence and a sense of mastery come forward. Mentally, students develop great focus and concentrati on. With a good teacher, values of self and other respect and support are t horoughy ingrained. I have been extremely fortunate to have Suzanne Pinette of Sun Dragon Dojo in Austin, Texas, as my children's teacher. She is a highly skilled black belt with great values. She provi des my children not only excellent technical guidance, but also promotes exce llent values. Perhaps most import ant for my children, she makes it fun! My strong advice is to avoi d a martial arts environment where emphasis is placed on competition. Also, avoid any teacher who is into “di scipline” of students. Gene rally, “discipline” is a code word that really means punishment. Ma king students do pushups or other tasks as punishment (for being silly or not doing something we ll or any reason) is not about discipline in the sense of self-regulation and commitment. It is about authoritarian c ontrol; humiliating and disrespectful, such “discipline” instills fear and s hame in a child. Let there be respect, let there be mastery, and let there be play. Make sure that an abiding teaching involv es consistent support and respect for all peers and teachers—all for one and one for all. I believe that movement and physical activity are vastly more important than academic and “so-called” intellectual development for children in the 4 to 8-yea r-old age group. I say “so-called” intellectual development because I think it is absurd to correlate intellect with academics, to reduce the concept of intelligence to the “mental” domain of life. I really agree with Joseph Chilton Pearce, author of The Magical Child , that tasks involving abstract inte llectual activity (the use of symbols as in academia) are meant to come in a bit later, after age 8 on the average, in terms of cognitive development. The task of 4 to 8-year-olds is to fully develop their relationships with their bodies, with the earth, with the natur al world. Pearce describes the task as a transfer from the matrix of “Mother” to that of “E arth.” We are meant to experience ourselves as fully connected to the natural world. This connection is establish ed by long, uninterrupted experience of active"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" 70 physical interaction with the natural world. The alte rnative, so common in urban existence as to be the norm, is to go through life feeling like we don't belong in the world, let alone our own bodies. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of our education system is that we have instilled a sense of failure and a self-image as failure in extremely large numbers of ch ildren. In reality, these children are “canaries in the coal mine,” indicators of a l eaky poisonous gas that is affecting all of us. To violate the nature of children by forcing standar ds and behavior that are not suited to their developmental needs is cruel; to saddle them wit h blame and shame for the results is a tragedy. Remember again to relax. Trust that your children are completely equipped to develop in astounding, wonderful ways. Give them the incredible gift of a relaxed, confident, unpressured environment in which to explore and grow. The result will be a young person who is relaxed, confident, and at ease, completely connected with you and with the world. Remember that Energy is a Key to Happiness When I turned 40, I became very sick and [sent many years dealing with the consequences. Life powerfully revealed to me the intense mi sery of having dynamo children full of abundant energy and zest, at the same time that I was in chronic fatigue. Do you agree with me that energy is a great key to happine ss, and to enjoying your children? That we are happier when we feel good and have energy? That we have so much more fun with young people when we can at least approximately match their energy? We must take care of ourselves if we want to be happy parents and allies of young people. Admittedly this is often very hard. It is typica lly not hard because we are doing anything wrong; our society is simply not conducive to the communi ty experience that enhanc es life with children. . Work and school are stressful. We are bombarded with st imulating nonsense that does not nourish us. And children are very needy. It is hard not because you are doing anything wrong, but simply because it is hard. You will be tired, and you must not be harsh on yourself. Just know that it is tr uly important and makes great sense to do what you can to take care of yourself. Physically, that means nourishing food, regular exercise and as much rest as you can get. Emotionally, it means connection and suppor t, and opportunities to express feelings."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" 71 Mentally, it means both accurate information and positive ideas. Spiritua lly, we thrive when we know connection, meaning and purpose. For our children, life especia lly means play, play, play! To fully enjoy our life with children, as I hope I have conveyed in the spirit of this book , we must uncover and free up any hurts and inhibitions we have about play. Many of us have to relearn how to play. As we reclaim our inherent playful nature, our energy is restored, and everyone is happier . We delight in our children’s play, and even sometimes get right in ther e with them in a great chase, drenching water play, or a rousing pillow fight. The world gets hea vy. Living, loving, and l aughing with our children is such a gift. May all who read these words be blessed with the energy to receive the gift! Remember the Importance of Rhythm (A Second Alternative 3 Rs for Childr en: Rhythm, Routine, and Regularity) My friend Donna Goertz, owner and di rector of Austin Montessori School, reviewed my booklet that was the precursor of the book you are readi ng now. She loved it and was most encouraging. At the same time, she pointed out one most signi ficant area I had failed to address. Donna has worked with children for three decades and has ra ised two generations of her own biological children and step-children. Her ob servation has to do with RHYTHM. Children need rhythm. They need routine. They need regularity. Donna bears witness to the unfortunate fact that la rge numbers of children today are sleep- deprived. Today's hectic world is one of working parents and attempts to meet adult individual needs within highly demanding schedules. In this world, what we see happening so often is that parents fail to establish a rhythm of regular routines for their ch ildren; dinners and bedtimes are a ll too often determined by parental needs and whims. Although this makes our generati on of parents sound irresponsible and selfish, I think much of this is actually a positive attempt to correct our own childhood experience of having been suppressed and controlled. For many of us, routi ne and regularity were there, but it was not a gentle, thoughtful and considerate est ablishment of rhythm in our live s. Many of us experienced a rigid and controlling imposition of our parents' will, coming from a pl ace of anxiety, tension, anger and stress. The phenomenon of generational pendulum swings between authoritarian and permissive childrearing is common in families."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" 72 Consistency is important in est ablishing the rhythm necessary for your child to develop good, positive habits. At the same time, consistency is not a supreme value in and of itself. Someone once observed Mahatma Gandhi's inconsistencies an d pointed them out to him in an accusatory tone. Gandhi's benign response was that the observer was accurate : that his commitment was to TRUTH, that truth was determined by the unique circumstances of each individual situation, and therefore was quite often not consistent. Donna Goertz really br ought home what I think is the key ingredient that must be added to bring forward the alchemical transformation that turns the base metal of consistency into a philosopher's stone of life-enhanci ng rhythm. Donna had just sent her youngest child to college; she was free to live a big part of her life accordi ng to her own desires. So what did she do? She fell in love with her current husband who happened to have two children of his own still many years away from leaving the nest. Donna made this choice from a place of experience (no naivetè here), and consciously embraced the need to c ontinue determining a great part of her life according to the needs of t he young people in her family. Loving, conscious self-sacrifice, determined according to the need s of our developing children , is the necessary approach to guide and complement consistency and creat e a healthy rhythm for your child . He will feel safe. She will thrive. Remember that the intention of Bi oPsychiatry is to drug your child The effect of this so-called tr eatment is to absolve the adults on whom your child depends of all responsibility. Once your ch ild is labeled as defective and placed on drugs, then a STOP sign is placed on the need to figure out what might r eally be going on. The prob lem is defined as a sick child needing medicine—no need to look further. Remember that these drugs are not a legitimate medical treatme nt of a medical disease or disorder from which your child suffers; that is a dangerous illusion. The dr ugs are a mechanism of social control and classroom engine ering. All too often, their authentic function is to punish children who cannot or will not play the role we adults would like to impose on them. Remember to NEVER GIVE UP"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":" 73 Labeling and drugging your child is a clear si gnal that adults have given up. Perhaps the most important thing you can ever do for a young person is to demons trate again and again and again that you will never give up on him. Remember to KEEP THINKING Related to never giving up is to never st op thinking about the needs of your child; a parent’s job never ends. Another of the most important things for y oung people to know is that you care enough to keep thinking as well of them as you possibly can. Mistakes are inevitable. Children have no need for perfect parents; they need really good, imperfec t parents who keep thinking and never give up. Remember to view your child through the EYES OF DELIGHT To see your child through the Eyes of De light is the greatest gift in the world you can give to your child and to yourself. As with the feeling of urgency and pressure, viewing a child with anything other than delight really says more about the viewer than t he child. Obviously children do experience distress and they do act this out; it means they need good attent ion from aware adults to help work something out. They are still inherent ly delightful. Adult responses of judgment and shame are not about the chil d; these responses are projections of feelings the adult carries inside himself. Remember NOT to trust the thinking of anyone who sees your child through anything other than the eyes of delight. There r eally are no “bad” children. Your child is completely good and delightful.

Support Get SUPPORT for yourself. I’m not talking about supp ort for your child, but for you . Parenting is an incredibly demanding job, and our society offers precious littl e by way of support. Figure out ways to get practical support such as child care, help with home responsibilities, transportation, etc. You also need emotional support. Raising a child inevitably and without fail triggers your own distress . It is the law that your ow n unresolved childhood i ssues will come up in dealing with your children. This can place incredible stress on you. The best thing you can do for your child is to get help for yourself in the areas where it gets hard and you get emotionally activated. Explore and express thoughts and feelings coming up for you in present time. If you think you need to seek professional help or attend a support or therapy group, do not hesitate to do so. Get support specifically wit h the parenting or caregiving expe rience. Adults listening to each other talk about relating to children is incredi bly valuable. Find other par ents, and talk and listen. Sharing with other adults helps discover common ground and possibl e solutions, release feelings and receive validation and support. We tend to get extr emely isolated; it is so important and such a relief to connect with other adults who care for children. The best support and thinking I know of around children and parenting is through a grassr oots peer counseling organization called Re- Evaluation Counseling (RC).

Time"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" 76 \"Nobody sees a flower—really—it is so small it takes time—we haven't time—and to see takes time, like to have a friend take s time.\" (Georgia O'Keeffe) It has been said that slowing down is the greatest act of civil disobedience one can commit in our society. Slow down and take time for your child. Quality time is good, but much more important is just time. Young pe ople need time to be nurtured, su pported, loved and involved with you. They need enough time without pressure to show you their distress. If they canít get it out with you, where can they? For your sake and your child's, it is im portant that you create a relaxed atmosphere free of pressure. All the forces of our market economy are geared to keep everyone going at an ever-increasing pace. It's profitable and counter-revolutionary. To quote my friend Leon ard Frank (personal communication), “Those who dare to slow down invite such labels as 'depression' (i.e., depressed or slowed activity). And off y ou go to the funny farm where the ex perts will try to get you up to speed again with—of all thi ngs—'speed,' which is not at all funny. . . . People who 'slow down' just may be reflecting. And to reflect seriously about one's place in soci ety and about society itself is the beginning of wisdom. ” For a child, slow time is essential. From a BioPsychiatr ic point of view and from a classroom teacher's point of view, daydreaming is as equal ly a “symptom” as is a high activity level. For a child, however, both are e ssential expressions of th eir naturally developing selves. A Note on Punishment I view punishment as mostly an act of despair. Is n't it tragic when relationships with our fellow human beings (and other life forms ) degenerate into an interaction based on retribution and retaliation? Did you know that for a long time t he United States has had by far the largest per capita prison population in all t he world—easily exceeding the former USSR and South Africa in its heyday of Apartheid?

Hell is when your vision is so distracted by demons that you see the sa cred being who is your child as shameful and disgusting. You are in hel l when you are overtak en by your own unhealed shame (the Devil) and fall victim to the tormenting emotions of embarrassment, anger and loathing. You are in hell when you buy into the lies that it is for your child's good that you be in this hell together and that you punish him for his wickedness. I think the truth is that we punish our children when they need our love more than ever. When they are having a hard time and showing us their di stress, they most cert ainly need our attention, but our loving and thoughtful attention. Time is a huge factor in whet her we punish our children. Responsible limit-setting and discipline require relaxed tho ught. Punishment, on the other hand, is easily done in haste and tension. Dan Jones' observation, and it tracks with my own, is t hat more than 90 percent of punishment incidents occur in situations where t here is pressure about time. Check this out for yourself. Punishment tends to take place when a child is being forced to adhere to the adult's externally imposed schedule to be somewhere or get the child somewhere. I think we need to understand this and, given the pr essures of modern-day life, vi ew ourselves with compassion. We know that prisons don't work except in a very narrow sense of removing someone from society; the prices we pay are enormous. One way to determine rationality is to look at whether there is flexibility to try other alternatives when something is no t working. Our society's current response to disintegration is to keep building more prisons. Our society's response to failures in nurturing the development of our young people is to drug more of them. I believe that punishment is not only tragic and pathetic, it simply doesn't work. Based on results, punishment begets more punishment, as well as fear, secrecy, shame and tense separation from the ones we ar e meant to love and cherish. Down Time"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" 78 It is important to allow our children down time. Cons tant activity and stimulation from radio, TV, video, computer, and other exter nal sources allow no space for quiet and stillness needed for inner seedlings to grow. Parents can help create this state by letting go of the belief that they are responsible for keeping their children busy and entertained . Consider the following dialogue: Child: “I want to watch TV.” Parent: “No.” Child: “I’m bored. What ar e we going to do now?” Parent: “Nothing.” Child: “I’m bored!” (restless, banging around, complaining. . .) Parent: “I’m sure you’ll think of something to do. . ., etc.” By placing the responsibility back on the child , one of two things will probably happen. Most of the time he will eventually pick something up or start drawing or reading or go outside and play. However, be prepared because sometimes it gets wo rse before it improves. If she is not used to down time, she will show withdrawal symptoms of i rritability and crankiness. Try to wait it out, knowing that it will get better. By doing this, you are preparing fertile ground for your childís development. One other thing can happen that may lo ok like withdrawal sympt oms. Your child will use you as a counselor. I say more about this in the next section. Special Time All young people need special time alone with their parents, especially when they are having a hard time. This means that you, as a loving par ent, care enough to set aside time (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, every night, once a week or whatever you can do) from your busy life for you and your child to be al one together. During this time, you do exactly what your child wants (it's OK to set limits on spending m oney according to your resources), and you are delightfully involved . If anything gets in the way of your delightfu l involvement with your child, you will need to come back later and get support to work on the underlying cause. "},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" 79 Attention Remember that “attention deficit disorder” is an extremely peculiar “disease” in which the distressing symptoms reside not in t he “patient” but in the adults who interact wit h the “patient.” It is useful to follow this awareness a bit further to propose the following maladies. TADD—Teacher Attention Deficit Disorder 2 (see footnote p. 69) Teaching is an incredibly difficult and under s upported job. A stressed teacher whose time and attention are overly taxed is more likely to have difficulty being flexible and creative enough to deal with demanding children. As a parent, one thing you can do to support your children's teachers is to act as a counselor. Allow them to unload their compla ints and difficulties on you; sym pathize and give them all the encouragement and support you can. Keep in mind that a teacher who accept s the erroneous BioPsychiatric interpretation of children’s behavior can be dangerous. Be firm and st and strong in your own decisions regarding your child's long-term welfare. DADD - Dad Attention Deficit Disorder Our society makes it extremely difficult for men to make time fo r their children, and fathers are often absent. I can only emphasize what an incredibl e difference it makes to a youngster to have his or her father actively interested and involved in his child's life. As a father, do everything you can to make this happen. SADD - School/Societal Atte ntion Deficit Disorder Matthew Fox, Dominican priest, and major literary proponent of Creation Spir ituality, said that “We are a nation that hat es its enemies more than we love our young people.” It is extremely sad, indeed, to give up on our childre n and drug them by the hundreds of thousands. No easy solutions here. As the Breggi ns pointed out in War Against Children , in raising childr en, there are many times for responsible adults when a decisi on must be made: EITH ER SUPPRESS THE CHILD OR TRANSFORM THE WAY YOU DO YOUR LIFE. On the Nature of Attention"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":" 80 I have deliberately played with the above acronyms in an attempt to shake loose the absurd belief that attention is a disorder ed deficit of a defective child. Th e fact that attention has become a commodity in our society, something we pay m ental health professionals for, is a symptom not of mental illness, but of a dist ressed alienated society. Our lack of good available attention for our children is sad; let's tackle t hat problem, rather than label, st igmatize and drug our children. I recently received a great gift t hat I want to share with you. It is a long excerpt from Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way, a pr ofound statement about attention. Very often, a creative block manifests itself as an addiction to fanta sy. Rather than working or living the now, we spin our wh eels and indulge in daydreams of c ould have, would have, should have. One of the great misconcepti ons about the artistic life is t hat it entails great swathes of aimlessness. The truth is that a creative life involves great swathes of attention. Attention is a way to connect and survive. “Flora and fauna reports,” I used to call t he long, winding letters from my grandmother. “The forsythia is starting and this morn ing I saw my first robin. . . . The roses are holding even in this heat. . . . The sumac has turned and that little m aple down by the mailbox. . . . My Christmas cactus is getting ready. . . .” I followed my grandmother's life like a long home movie: a shot of this and a shot of that, sliced together with no pattern that I could ever see. “Dad's cough is getting worse. . . . The little Shetland looks like she'll drop her foal early. . . . Joanne is back in the hospital at Anna. . . . We named the new boxer Trixie and she likes to sleep in my cactus bed—can you imagine?” I could imagine. Her letters made that easy. Life through grandma's eyes was a series of small miracles: the wild tiger lilies under the cott onwoods in June; the quick lizard scooting under the gray river rock she admired for its satiny finish. Her letters clocked the seasons of the year and her life. She lived until she was eighty, and the le tters came until the very end. When she died, it was as suddenly as her Christmas cactus: here today, gone tomorrow. She left behind her letters and her husband of sixty-two y ears. Her husband, my grandfather Daddy Howard, an elegant rascal with a gambler's smile and a loser's luck, had made and lost several fortunes, the last of them permanently. He drank them away, gambled them away, tossed them away the way she"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 threw crumbs to her birds. He squandered life's big chances the way she savored the small ones. “That man,” my mother would say. My grandmother lived with that man in tiled Spanish houses, in trailers, in a tiny cabin halfway up a mountain, in a railroad flat, and, finally, in a house made out of ticky-tacky where they all looked just the same. “I don't know how she stands it,” my mother would say, furious with my grandfather for some new misadventure. She meant she didn't know why. The truth is, we all knew how she stood it. She stood it by standing knee-deep in the flow of life and paying close attention. My grandmother was gone before I learned the lesson her letters were teaching: survival lies in sanity, and sanity lies in paying attention. Yes, her letters said, Dad's cough is getting worse, we have lost the house, there is no money and no work , but the tiger lilies are blooming, the lizard has found that spot of sun, the roses are holding despite the heat. My grandmother knew what a painful life had taught her: success or fa ilure, the truth of a life really has little to do with its quality. The quality of life is in proporti on, always, to the capacity for delight. The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention. In a year when a long and rewarding love affa ir was lurching gracelessl y away from the center of her life, the writ er May Sarton kept A Journal of a Solitude . In it, she records coming home from a particularly painful weekend wit h her lover. Entering her empty house, “I was stopped by the threshold of my study by a ray on a Korean chr ysanthemum, lighting it up like a spotlight, deep red petals and Chinese yellow center . . . . Seeing it was like getting a transfusion of autumn light.” It's no accident that May Sarton uses the wo rd transfusion. The loss of her lover was a wound, and in her responses to that chrysanthemum, in the act of paying attent ion, Sarton's healing began. The reward for attention is always healing. It may begin as the healing of a particular pain—the lost lover, the sickly child, the shattered dream. But what is healed, finally, is the pain that underlies all pain: the pain t hat we are all, as Rilke phrases it, “unutterably alone.” More than anything else, attention is an act of connection."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 Writing about attention, I see that I have written a good deal about pain. This is no coincidence. It may be different for others, but pain is what it took to teach me to pay attention . In times of pain, when the future is too terrifying to contempl ate and the past too painful to remember, I have learned to pay attention to right now. The precise moment I was in was always the only safe place for me. Each moment, taken alone, was always bearable. In the exact now, we are all, always, all right . Yesterday the marriage may have ended. Tomorro w the cat may die. The phone call from the lover, for all my waiting, may not ever come, but just at the moment, just now, that's all right. I am breathing in and out. Realizing this, I began to notice that ea ch moment was not without its beauty. (pp. 52-55, italics mine). All this psychiatric hoopla about attention di sorders is a great distortion and perversion of a very basic and fundamental human experience, an experience that Julia Cameron writes about in a particularly eloquent way. Our children are showing us their pain . As parents we are feeling pain related to our own struggles to live well in an extremel y stressful society, and related to the anguish we feel when we see our children suffer. Our children are hurting and we are hurting. On t op of this, we feel fear in the midst of a highly fearful society; out of such fear comes the suppressive and despair ing BioPsychiatric practice of putting our children on drugs. It trul y is a tragic irony and perversion of the truth about attention to label children as attention-disor dered and give them drugs . The irony is that we label pain as a disorder of the very quality we most need to heal—the quality of attention. Also an irony is that, as Cameron stated, “ pain is what it took to teach me to pay attention .” Our pain commands our attention. Our children's pain co mmands our attention. It seems to me that these “ADHD” children are forcing us to pay attention to them, to ourse lves, and to the many ways in which our current ways of living and raising childre n cause pain. Let's not respond by suppressing the cries of our children. Let's do respond by paying attention; bette r yet, by giving our attention, freely and with love. “ Attention is a way to connect and survive .” In essence, to pay att ention to your child is to connect with and be in relationship with your child. Good, aware, loving att ention is good, aware, loving relationship."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" 83 “ The capacity for delight is the gift of paying attention .” To see your child through the eyes of delight is the greatest gift you can give yourself and your child.

I think it is a tragic mistake to act as if academic, behavioral and social chall enges are a result of biologic al or genetic defects and to drug children with stimulants for “treatment” of those defects. At the same time, it is import ant to know that behavior (includi ng attention) cannot exist without its physiological, neurological an d biochemical correlates, since em otional distress greatly affects all these factors. I have already suggested ways to help children wit h emotional distress, and Part III is entirely devoted to this topic. Now I want to briefly mention four very specific, common-sense areas to examine in exploring ways to affect the biochemistry of your children in a positive way. There is a simple law about being in a human body: “ What Goes In Must Come Out. The Quality of What Comes Out is Relate d to the Quality of What Goes In .” (Corollary: “Garbage in garbage out”). This simple truth has pr ofound implications. Once understood, it imparts great responsibility. I encourage you as parents to think of this respons ibility as an opportunity to provide five very special gifts to yourselves and your children. These gifts are quality Food, Light, Sound, Talk and Touch. Food The place we have the greatest control and influence in the quality of our child’s health, attention and behavior has to do with nutrition. The ev idence is very clear that food affects health, mood and behavior. A lot has been written about the s pecific link between food and hyperactivity. The amount of junk food t hat children in the Unit ed States eat is appalling. As a parent, you can help your child's biochemistry by restricting the following two items:"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" 85 1) Sugar (in all its disguises)—w hite sugar, brown sugar, sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, etc. (Please note that substitutes such as Nutrasw eet are also toxic and hav e been linked directly to problems with child ren.) (See Crook, 1991) 2) Chemical Additives and Preservati ves—Read the labels and be selective. You should be aware that some children have specific food allergies. These are often related to sugar and/or chemical additiv es, but can definitely include ot her foods. Dairy products, in particular, have been shown to be a major negative factor in m any children’s health and behavior. Always consider this where there are recurrent congestive problems or ear infections (Oski, 1977). Encourage your children to eat fresh fruit. Fresh food is always the best choice. Select foods that are organic and free of pesti cides and other chemicals and have received as little processing as possible. The closer the food to its whole, natur al state, the more nutri tious and healthy it is for your child. Whole grains and vegetables ar e good food for the body. I know from personal experience that it is extremely difficult to feed child ren well in a society that is so nutritionally out of balance. Do the best you can. It ís worth the effort. There are health providers who offer biochemical alternatives that may be helpful to your child. Doris Rapp, M.D. (1991) offers an allergy-extract therapy. Billie Jay Sahley, Ph.D. (1994) distributes a blend of vitamins, minerals, herbs and amino acids called “Calm Kids.” Dr. Mary Ann Block (www.blockcenter.com) treat s allergy and nutritional deficits, and helps families wean their children off of psychiatric drugs. Some parent s swear by blue green al gae. Homeopathic medicine has helped many children. There is a urine te st available nowadays th at measures certain neurotransmitter levels in the body, and various practitioners use amino acid supplements to remedy perceived “imbalances.” Some people thin k this has helped them. These treatments are benign for the most part, but see the note on neurot ransmitters below, and keep in mind that most of the time, there really is not hing abnormal going on in t he child. Please see the references at the back of this book for information on resources. My view is that it makes sense to think well about biochemistry. There is a dangerous tendency, however, to get just as caught up in the “a lternative” biological tr eatments as we do with psychiatric biological treatment s. A narrow focus on “fixing” a defective child, whether it be"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" 86 through psychopharmacology or through “natural” alte rnatives still tends to blame the child and move the helper away from acceptanc e and delight in the child, just as he is. It also distracts the helper from the big pictur e of other possibilities regarding lif e style, family, sc hool and society. Please remember the essential nature of your child and his on going need and demand to fully express himself physically, emotionally and verbally. It is important to know that suppression of emotion or be havior does alter biochemistry. Similarly, release of suppressed feeling or action often affects a profound healing alteration of deranged biochemistry. Exercise and a renewed sens e of purpose also have a great effect on our physiology. A Note on Neurotransmitters In today’s United States, child (and adult) struggles and di fferences are generally interpreted as evidence of genetic or biological pathology (a.k.a. mental illness). Hence, a conservative estimate is that the United St ates has 10 million young people, maybe 1 out of 7, on mind and body altering psychotropic drugs. Given that the rhetor ical justification for these drugs, in the guise of science, is that they correct some sort of chemical imbalance having to with too many or too few neurotransmitters, a comment on these mysteri ous chemical substances is both necessary and appropriate. My purpose is not to provide the neuropha rmacological dynamics of neur otransmitters. I refer the reader to Grace Jacks on’s excellent new book, Rethinking Psychiatric Drugs , or the work of any number of others, including Pe ter Breggin and David Healy for that explanation. (See also the websites listed in the resources of this book.) My purpose in this short note is only to put in place another speed bump against the tendency to readily trust government medical authority, and especially against the uninform ed drugging of our children. The basic argument is simple, outlined in ch apter 1; social failures are due to biologically based mental illness. The main psychiatric postula te is that these mental illnesses consist of chemical imbalances, mostly havi ng to do with these neur otransmitters, of which there are many. Psychiatry has selected a small number as subjects of its “treatments; most Americans have heard about serotonin, and likely dopamine and norepinephrine, the designated culprits for the most popular psychiatric diagnoses. Various drugs are said to target these chemicals in a"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":" 87 therapeutic way, usually having to do with production or re -uptake (absorption in to a cell) of the relevant chemical. There is also a huge market for alternative, non-pharmaceutical products that are said to affect t hese neurotransmitters. My objective is to share my discernment of fact versus opinion in just a few areas. Please note that what I call opinions are us ually presented as facts by the gov ernment, media and psychiatry. I ask not that you believe what I say; my hope is simply that this note will influence you to slow down enough to reconsider expe rt or media opinions, hold off on the drugs, and do your own research. I am guided by the truth of a saying I first heard attributed to American humorist Josh Billings: “The problem is not that people don’t know anything—it’s that they know so many things that ain’t so!” 1) OPINION: Mental illnesses lik e depression and ADHD and bipola r disorder are due to chemical imbalances. FACT: None of the problems rout inely seen by psychiatry has been scientifically demonstrated to be of biological or genetic origin. There is no validated and replicated research that identifies an objective abnormality that denotes disease. In the case of depression, for ex ample, the low serotonin hypothesis simply does not hold up. 2) OPINION: Psychiatric drugs are sm art, or selective, as their name indicates (SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor); they “sel ectively” target specific chemicals in the brain. FACT: The chemical dynami cs of the human body are very complex and little understood. Psychotropic drugs radically affect these comp lex dynamics. Serotonin is not even primarily in the brain; for example, it is abundant in the gut, and alteri ng the chemistry of the gut has serious consequences. As another example, have you ever wondered why sexual dysfunction is such a common SSRI drug e ffect? Various organ systems are obviously affected. 3) OPINION: It is safe to treat “mental illness” with psychotropic drugs."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 88 FACT: A) Remember, there is no evidence of defect — psychiatric diagnoses are entirely subjective and based on behavior; B) The drugs adversely affect various organ systems of the body, including metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal and central nervous system functions. 4) OPINION: The drugs correct an unnatural, pat hological neurological condition or a chemical imbalance. FACT: The only demonstrated pathol ogy begins upon drug treatmen t. A dramatic example is with the so-called antipsychotic drugs, like Thorazine, Haldol, Zyprexa and Risperdal. This class of drugs is known to have created one of the lar gest epidemics of neurological disease in the history of the world — Tardive Dyskinesia. In short, to see the truth about biopsychia try, one must become thor oughly disillusioned of any simpleminded trust in medical, government and m edia authority. I have wr itten about the need to confront our condi tioned denial in Eyes Wide Open , which is available as an ebook (www.wildestcolts.com). The woman primarily responsible for the discovery of neurotransmitters, Candace Pert, calls them “molecules of emotion,” the title of her book on that discovery. She was head of the brain chemistry department at NIH for 13 years and one of the two discover ers of the serotonin binding process that made many of thes e drugs possible. To facilitate the relevant disillusionment, consider that just a few years ag o, Pert stated about t hese drugs, “I am alarmed at the monsters I created!” One ought to stand up and take notice of the fact that neve r before has a discoverer of a group of drugs come out so strongly against them. In a more recent interview with Davi d Jay Brown, when asked about the potential for new psychoactive drugs in the future, Pe rt said, “I’m never moving in that direction...we’re at our best when we have our natural drugs. It’s like our own nat ural chemicals, unadultera ted, are just totally amazing.” She goes on to say that, “Anything you take changes your brain, because there’s a law that a natural system wil l always compensate when you perturb it.” When you take a psychiatric drug, it literally changes the brain. Light"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" 89 Along with the rising incidence of so-called “attention disorder s,” you may have noticed that more and more Americans are wearing glasses (I’ve heard estimates of 70 percent), and an increasing number of children are experiencing vision problems. No t long ago Americans spent 90 percent of their time outdoors. Today, the average U.S. citizen s pends 97 percent of his time indoors. Research indicates that the quality of light in a classroom directly affects attention and behavior (see Liberman, 1991). We cert ainly know it affects the ey es. It is recommended that we keep TV and video watching at a minimum and reme mber that a computer screen has a similar effect on the eyes. Make sure your children spend as much time outdoors as possible. Give them the gift of full-spectrum light! Sound How often has your child experienced the gift of quiet? Or sat in a place free of man-made noise and listened to the wind and the water and other sounds in natur e? I realize many of us in the cities cannot easily provide this gift, but it is so important. Research and experience have clear ly demonstrated the effects of sound on mood, behavior, health, thinking and learning (see Halpern,_1985). Pl ease do the best you can to provide your child as much time as possible in an environment where the quality of sound is calm, quiet, soothing, peaceful. Our children are greatly over-stimulated. This over-stimulation interferes with their ability to be self-directed, with the quality of their awareness and attention, and with their physiology, neurology and biochemistry. An over-stimulated mind and body cannot rest, does not know calm. It’s true that children love excite ment; give them that. You can do your child a great service, however, by providing time in an environment wit h good food, good light an d good sound. This is healthy stimulation. Talk As Jane Healy descri bes it in her book Endangered Minds , talk is “the magic formula.” Conversation builds the “executive brain.” In order to sustain attention and concentration, young people must have experienced the “rich broth of lang uage and reflection.” This “inner speech”"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" 90 experience, or mental dialogue with one's self, is necessary to develop a capacity for personal thought and problem solving. It is really quite simple. You must talk with your child—a lot! Help your children talk and think their way through a problem. Adults must act as coaches to show childr en how to internalize speech, as this teaches them strategies for th inking. Personal thought and problem solving result. There are at least three prerequisites for the development of inner speech and the executive brain. First is quiet. A child mu st have time in an environment fr ee of over-stimulating background noise and programming. Second is competent and caring adults to act as coaches. You model reflective thought and coach your child, asking questions that will help her think through problems. Third, you listen. By listening to and drawing out your child's own thinking, you prov ide support and encourage independence. This mutually shared responsibility creates a learning environment that is optimal for your child’s development. A recent interaction with my daughter, Vanessa, provides an example of what I mean by coaching your child on reflective thought. V anessa found my hammer and started banging around the house. Fortunately I had some available attent ion, so rather than reacting by ordering an immediate return of my tool, I asked what she was doing. With a slight tone suggesting how stupid I was for asking such a question, she said “I'm hammering.” A pleasant reply of “I'm working” would not have been unusual. Ei ther way, if your attention is good, you're in good shape to keep asking questions. You may ask, “How's it goi ng?” She may respond with “Good.” or she may ignore you. You might ask, “What do you do with a hammer?” She mi ght answer, “Hit with it.” or “Hammer.” or “Bu ild something.” My interaction with V anessa went something like this. Vanessa: I want to build something. Dad: Good idea! What do you need? Vanessa: Nails."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" 91 Dad: We don't have any. Vanessa: Oooh, pooh. Dad: What can we do? Vanessa: Go buy some? Dad: Great idea. When we pick up your brother we 'll go to the hardware store. (At the store, Vanessa picks out the nails she wants with discussion of size and amount. We return home and she goes out to bu ild with her brother, Eric, who has an ongoing tree house/fort project. Mom entarily she returns). Vanessa: I can't find any wood. Dad: For what? Vanessa: I want to build a prayer. Dad: What? Vanessa: A prayer. Dad: What do you mean? Vanessa: (She shows me with her arms. Eric notices and knows immediately she means a cross.) Dad: Aha!

Dad: How about asking your brother. Vanessa: (She goes out again and in a little while returns with a completed “prayer.”) I’ll conclude this section by quoting Kenneth Kliv ington, editor of The Brain, Cognition and Education . When asked how he would advise parents, he immediately responded: I continue to place the emphasis on the need to generate language and t hought, not just listen and watch . If we consider the brain as an organ of though t, it has to be structured to work right. If you don’t wire your computer righ t, it isn’t going to work right. A Special Note On TV By now you have no doubt realized that I see television as a ha rmful technology. The average American spends five hours daily in front of the TV, making TV wa tching, after work and sleep, the"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" 92 main activity everyday in many of our lives. For five hours every day, we choose to watch instead of participate. The average child spends 1,680 minut es per week watching TV. In contrast, the number of minutes per week that parents spend in meaningful conv ersation with their children is 38.5. The pervasive use of TV makes it probably the greatest single influence on our young people's lives today. What a shame. I am not talking about the content. Much has been said about the violence, sex, advertising, insanity and values of TV programming—PBS or MTV, sports or drama, sex or sitcom, no matter. Nor am I talking about the insidious and conscienc eless manipulation of young people’s minds by a corporate world whose primary guiding value is and always will be a profit motive, although I do address it later. What I am talking about is the very act of watching any TV. My purpose is to draw your attention to the fundamental nature of the technology and how it acts on the minds of children. I will use three of the subtitles from Jerry Mander’s chapter on TV as audiovisual training in his book, In the Absence of the Sacred . Freedom of Speech for the Wealthy This point is quite simple. Only the larg est corporations in the world dominate the broadcast signals for the obvious reason that only they can affo rd it. TV is a private system in the hands of the largest corporations. Freedom of speech in TV broadcasting could not be further from the truth; it is no more than an il lusion for the general public. Mander shares the most shocking statistic: The average American who watches five hours of television per day sees approximately 21,000 commercials per year. This translates into 21,000 identical mess ages about life, all aggressively saying, “Buy something—do it now!” The Technology of Passivity The fact that TV is on for an average of eigh t hours a day in American homes is proof of its hypnotic quality. The term “Zombi e” has been used by many parents to describe TV’s effects on their children. Scientists have studied this phen omenon and found that the brain slips into an “alpha” brainwave mode after watc hing TV. This is a noncognitive mode, meaning no thinking, no filtering. Information can be placed directly into the mind, without viewer participation."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" 93 Mander cites three reasons why TV viewing causes the brain to slip into this mode. One is the lack of eye movement. When an image does not ha ve to be sought, a key aspect of mental stimulation is lost. The second factor, according to psychologists who use hypnotism, is that TV very effectively induces a hypnotic trance. Looking at a flickery TV screen (60x/second) is just like staring at a hypnotistís candle. Mander considers his third factor most im portant. Images come from the TV screen at their own speed as an image “stream” outside the vi ewer’s control. No pulling out images. No contemplation. No active participation. If you attempt to do so, you fall behind. In order to watch TV, you have to surrender to t he images; you must allow the images to enter at their speed. The only other choice is to withdraw from the experience . Comparing television viewing to the use of drugs , Mander concludes that TV has many of the characteristics of Valium and other tranquilizers. He goes on to say that this is only half the story, however. If TV is a drug, says Mander, it is not really Valium, it is Speed . For our purposes, the equation goes like this: TV is Speed Ritalin is Speed Therefore, TV is Ritalin Acceleration of the Nervous System I conclude this section on the effects of TV viewing by quoting Mander on how TV directly promotes hyperactivity. In their famous study of the effects of television , researchers at Australian National University predicted that as television bec ame more popular in Australia, there would be a corresponding increase in hyperactivity among children. I found this prediction alarming because many parents of hyperactive children place their kids in front of the television set, where they seem to calm down. Apparently, the opposite effect is what finally results. Here’s how it works: While sitting quietly in front of the TV, the child sees people punching each other on the screen. There is the impulse to reac t as the fight-or-flight in stinct is activated,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" 94 but since it would be absurd to react to a televisi on fight, the child suppresses the emotion. As the fighting continues, so does the cycle of impulse and suppressi on. Throughout the television- viewing experience, the child is drawn back and forth on this se e-saw of action and suppression, all the while appearing z apped and inactive. When the set goes off, this stored-up energy bursts forth in the disorganized, frant ic behavior that we associate wit h hyperactivity. Often, the only calming act is to again put the se t on, which starts the cycle anew. Please consider that TV trains children for drug and commodity dependenc ies. I very highly recommend that you read Mander’s work (see re ferences) and allow yourself to think the unthinkable: What about the elimination of television? I saw a client recently whose presenting probl em was a scuffle with her husband over a gun when she threatened to shoot their TV. When presented with a similar dilemma, Swami Beyondananda (Steve Bhaerman, New Texas Magazine ) recommended that the couple go ahead and shoot the TV. His advice was to substitute two hours of television each evening with two hours of Tell-A-Vision in which fam ily members take turns sharing their dreams and visions for life. What a gift! Jane Healy, in her book, Endangered Minds , concludes a chapter called “Sesame Street and the Death of Reading” this way: Children immersed from birth in the spicy se nsory bouillabaisse of vi sual immediacy will not become readers unless they have also s oaked up the Rich Br oth of Language and Reflection. Preschoolers who have been sold gi mmicks in the name of learning and school- age children whose needs are h abituated to the easy pleasures of viewing may well find the culture of school an alien o ne. Their brains, shaped by vi sual novelty, may gradually lose the ability to bend themselves inte lligently around the written word. (P. 234) Leonard Frank has written a lot on thinking and propaganda and brainw ashing. His most recent publication is called Influencing Minds: A Reader in Quotations . After reading the above section on TV, Leonard wrote: “TV pr omotes hyperactivity. No doubt about it. It's also a marvelous brainwashing tool. It gives you no time to think, unlike books which because they allow you to use them at your own pace are a great aid to re flection, knowledge, self-knowledge and wisdom."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" 95 Descartes once wrote ( Discourse on Method , 1637) 'The reading of good books is like conversing with the best people of earlier times!' What be tter way to sharpen our wits and raise our consciousness.” Touch Jean Liedloff, in The Continuum Concept , coined a phrase that puts a name on something that deeply affects most of us as parents. Itís called “In- Arms Deprivation.” What this means is that we are deeply affected by our unmet need to be held as babies. Babies need to be held constantly in the first six months of life, and a great deal of t he time thereafter. Fortunat ely we have recovered some from the professional advic e that our own parents received, which was to leave babies in their cribs, let them cry themselv es to sleep, feed them on schedule, et c. However, this fact of our own upbringing, together with the bu syness and demands of life, still ma kes it very difficult for us to wholeheartedly meet t he needs of our children. The way to sp oil children is by neglecting their needs. Always remember that meeting a child’s needs is all to the good . Another “alternative” treatment of “ADHD” is a type of ph ysical therapy called Sensory Integration (Ayres, 1979), which involves a lot of movement and physical co ntact. My own limited anecdotal evidence suggests it can be helpful. My problem with this and other approaches such as “neurotherapy” (EEG brain wave biofeedback) is that they tend to be based on the premise that not only is there a legitimate di fference between children, but that the ones called “ADHD” are “pathological” and need to be corrected back to “no rmal.” Thus, the physical therapy is not framed as a way of responding to a basic human need for t ouch and contact, or to def icits or hurts around touch and closeness. Rather, the problem is “tac tile defensiveness” which sounds very clinical pathological to me. The actual modalities of movement—touching, banging, crashing, jumping, chewing, etc.,—are great. My main warning is once again about labeling your child's unique expressions as a clinical disorder; the subsequent tendency is to relate to her as an object or a syndrome, rather than as a uni que, delightful young person. It should also be noted that many young people , just as adults, der ive great benefit from massage. Craniosacral work, which involves mani pulation guided by the craniosacral pulse or rhythm, has been reported to help many children.

This chapter contains theory and tips from the teachings of Re-Evaluation Counseling, a grassroots peer counseling organization which has developed some of the clearest thinking I have seen anywhere on children and parenting. While the writing is ori ented toward parents, the principles ap ply for all adult allies of young people. Theory 1) Human beings are inherently zestfu l, intelligent, loving, and cooperative. 2) When human beings are hurt physically or em otionally, they experi ence distress. This distress is then recorded and stored in the body , and interferes with all the above qualities of our inherent nature (that is , we become less intelligent and cooperative). 3) Fortunately, human beings hav e a built-in mechanism for healin g from the effects of having been hurt. This mechanism can be called emotional discharge; our hurt is healed by expressing our feelings. 4) Children will use their parents as a primary resource to express themselves if it feels safe and their parents support them. Tips 1) Know that children (like adults) are not “reas onable” when upset. They generally don’t “talk it out.” 2) Your attention is essential. Counsel your child when you feel pretty awake and aware. Don’t try to counsel your child when you are em otionally upset, over-tired or distracted by other concerns. 3) Emotional expression (crying, shaking from fear, angry talk) is not the hurt, it is the release of the hurt. We often confus e the hurt with the release of t he hurt. When a child cries, for example, (unless she is in acute response to pai n such as being stuck by a diaper pin), she is releasing a hurt that was alr eady there before she cried. The emotional discharge, the expression of the feelings, is what allows the child to heal from the hurt."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" 99 4) Do not interfere with the discharge by trying to get the child to laugh or be distracted, by shaming the child for showing feelings, or in any other way. Instead, relax, stay close, encourage discharge. Keep reaching in. Know that your child wants to be completely close to you. It is only the distress that makes the child push you away (or makes you want to get away!). 5) Remember that when a child shows anger that he really doesn’t want to hurt anyone or anything. Protect your child from doing harm and be confident that she is doing what she can to express some really difficult feelings. 6) Few in our parents’ generation had this info rmation, so few of us were supported to express ourselves emotionally. Doing this for your child will not be easy. Counsel your child, but get help when you feel that the job is more than y ou can handle by yourself. A Note on Seeking Professional Help If you decide to get prof essional help, be sure you know t he approach and perspective of those you consider. Ask the professi onals tough questions about how they see children and families. Make sure they whole-heartedly support your dec ision to avoid drugging your child. Make sure that they think about young people in a way that really makes sens e and is consistent with what you are doing as a parent. Expect complete respect for you and your child. "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" 100 CHAPTER 9 Shame: A Legacy of Misery Shame is the awful feelin g that you are bad, wicked, defecti ve, incompetent, or in some way fundamentally flawed. Shame is t he belief not that you did someth ing wrong, but that there is something wrong with you. Shame is t he worst feeling in the world. It feels so bad you just want to hide. John Bradshaw (1988), in his book Healing the Shame That Binds You , clued me into this. A defining characteristic of shame is that it feels unbearable to be exposed. Shame thrives as a hidden secret and compels the bearer to isolate and avoid confrontiv e situations that threaten to expose the unbearable feeling and conviction of fundamental worthl essness. So how does a child acquire this terrible feeling that he is flawed and defective? How does a child come to carry a conviction that she is bad, wrong and undeserving? It comes from outside. Instilling Shame: On the Psychodynamics of Abuse Alice Miller (1990) presents one of the clearest explanations of the psychodynamics of child abuse. According to Miller, children see themselves as the responsible centers of the universe and their parents as omnipotent and all-knowing. Lacking the informa tion and power available to adults, when a child is hurt by a parent, the ch ild unavoidably interna lizes the experience. Strangely enough, the ch ild internalizes both sides of the experience, as victim and as powerful adult perpetrator. Naturally, the prim ary identification is that of victim, afraid and ashamed. When a child is not supported and not allo wed to express and work through the effects of such a hurt, he will protect himself intrapsychically through the mec hanism of \"splitting.\" This means that in order to function without feeling constantly overwhelmed by fear and shame, the ch ild will \"split off\" the internalized experience of being a powerless, te rrified victim and banish th is knowledge as deeply as possible into the unconscious mind. Just as it is natural for a child to initially see herself as a terrified victim, it is equally natural that, given a later opportunity, that sa me child will choose to identify with a powerful perpetrator in a relational world in which abusive inequities of power are the norm. The final psychodynamic of this process is that the split -off internalized victim self is projected from the unconsci ous depths of the psyche onto the other person in an interaction. We feel bad deep inside, but long ago learned how to protect ourse lves by keeping the feelings deep down out of conscious awareness. So instead of recognizing and ow ning our shame, we turn around and blame another, one who is weaker, less powerful. We project our shame onto our child."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" 101 The process includes four stages: (1) An act of abus e, (2) internalization of both sides of that abusive interaction, (3) splitting and unconscious denia l of victimization, and (4) projection of the denied powerless and shame-filled victim sel f. Now the stage is set for re-enactment and perpetuation of the abusive patte rn. To the individual who unc onsciously projects his own internalized terror and shame onto another, that other is bad and powerless, fully deserving and in need of correction. The orig inal victim acts on such a conviction and is fully justified in whatever act is perpetrated. The cycle of abuse is complete. My description of Alice Miller's psychodynamic in terpretation of abuse emphasizes shame as a potent factor in human relations . The child always carries a hea vy load of shame. Viewing the world from a responsible center, a child natura lly accepts and believes a parent's assertion by word and action that the child is deserving of whatever abuse the parent commits. He naturally accepts whatever labels and \"treatments\" the adults of the systems in which he is involved give him. That we are able to transform the moral language of “bad, wicked, sinful child” to that of “needy, dependent, biogenetically defective ADHD mental patient” conc eals the above dynamic. The core emotional states of fear and shame are unaltered in this transla tion and reside in the experience of powerlessness and helplessness. Fear and shame remain fully intact in the \"patient\" child/professional interactional dynami cs of our coercive education and mental health systems. A distorted view of human nature makes it easier to perpetuate the legacy of shame by providing wonderful protection against the inevitable tinges of discomf ort that surface in the midst of harmful activity. Adultism is perfectly fine when children are seen as born in original sin, or fundamentally lazy and unmotivated, or as untamed animals needing to be civilized. Our education and mental health systems can easily perpetuate shame and do great harm without having to agonize in guilt, without feeling their own shame. They can put two million of our children on Ritalin without qualm; all that is necessary is to be convinced that these massive numbers of young people are inherently flawed, biologically and genetically defective. "},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" 102 Theodore Roszak (1992), in his book on EcoPsychol ogy, argues that this quality of shame, manifested as a guilty conscience and fundamental distrust of se lf, is absolutely necessary to ensure that humans operate as cogs in a system that is basica lly anti-human. According to Roszak, The politics of domination begins when some people teach other people that the body, the psyche, the community, and nature-at -large are unreliable, incompeten t, hostile, therefore in need of top-down supervision. Authoritarian politi cs roots itself as the guilty conscience. It begins by convincing people they cannot trust one another, that they ca nnot trust themselves. (p. 230) (italics mine). Our competitive system of compulsory age-segregated education is designed to fulfill this function well. What Roszak is real ly talking about here is now comm only referred to as a feeling of shame. He quotes Gary Snyder, ecology's poet laureate, to summarize the issue: A ruling class, to survive, must propose a Law: a law to work mu st have a hook into the social psyche—and the most effective way to achieve this is to make people doubt their natural worth and their instincts, especially sexual. To make 'human nature' suspect is also to make Nature—the wilderness—the adversary. Hence the ecological crisis of today. (p. 230). And hence the crisis and \"War Against Ch ildren\" today. Our Judeo-Ch ristian heritage does much of the work. Shame-based child rearing creates the interp ersonal dynamics. Our mental health system with its BioPsychiatric basis fits right in. And shame is a steel thread that powerfully reinforces it all. On Shame and Suppressing Our Children's Joy and Zest It is humbling and saddening to rea lize that an inevitable result of our carrying shame is that we suppress our children. Just as it feels unbearable to expose sham e, it also feels unbearable to be around shameless people. When we are carrying shame, it is unbearable to be around people who are zestful and enthusiastic and love life and unconditionally love themselves. Exuberant joy in our children is excruciating! "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":" 103 Why is this? Remember that shame is the most awful feeling in the worl d. Remember that we split it off, banish it into our unconscious to pr otect ourselves. Remember that shame thrives in secrecy, that it feels unbearable to be exposed. Remember t hat we were shamed not only for our defiant self-defense, but for our exuberance and enthusiasm. Take a look at how your own family of origin handled “braggi ng,” how you feel about singing your own praises. Shame is attached to all the feelings we need to express in order to heal. The many prohibitions, punishments and admonitions against expressi ng our feelings when we were children make it very difficult for us to do so now. Each time we releas e our buried feelings, we also ex perience the ugly shame that is bound to these feelings, making recovery work all the more difficult. It was not only the so-call ed negative feelings that were bound in shame. So was the joy, the zest, the exuberance, the enthusiasm ! We were shamed for all our fee lings. The result is that we can hardly stand it now when ou r naturally outrageous, dynamic and enthusiastic children hold themselves out as the most va luable center of the universe. The Way Out: Complete Self-Appreciation It makes sense, then, that it's hard to see our children through “The Eyes of Delight” when they're showing us their distress or their zest. What I want you to cons ider now is that it is vital to delight in their delight! The way out is simple. Yet it is probably the mo st profound, powerful, difficult and challenging tool we have in our recovery. It is to ruth lessly expose the shame, to give no quarter to embarrassment. And the most effective way to acco mplish this is, as Walt Whitman modeled, to sing \"A Song of Myself.\" To proudly and joyfully si ng our own praises is to challenge every bit of shameful conditioning we've received from our fa milies, our churches, ou r schools, all of our socio-cultural heritage. The fact is that we must delight in and love ourselves unconditionally in order to truly delight in and apprecia te our children. The alternative is to suppress them so that we won't feel so bad.

"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" 110 CHAPTER 10 Basic Principles and Phenomena Three of the most important and challenging areas in which y oung people need our counseling help are (1) Crying, (2) Working on Fear, and (3) Anger. Before di scussing these, however, I want to stress some basic principles that parents and other adults working with young people need to understand. First and foremost, always remember that th is job of caring for and supporting the development of our young people is profoundly si gnificant, important and valuable. This may seem obvious and in truth it is obv ious; yet it seems that much of the function (based on results) of modern urban-industrial existence is to obscure the obvious. One of the best ways to create obscurity and confusion is to say one thing and do another—the old “Do as I say, not as I do.” Double messages to children creat e great distress, uncertainty an d confusion: a parent who says “I love you” while a tone of voice and posture reveals an inner experience of tense anger; a teacher who lectures again and again on respect, but is condescending and patronizing in tone and action. Another pointed example is a society that extols “family values” while at the same time failing to provide for the needs of families and young people. There is very little slack, very little flexibility, very little financial support for us as parents. Based on a look at resource allocation, Matthew Fox, American theologi an and writer, has said that “W e are a nation that hates our enemies more than we love our young people.” Similarly, I would say that we are a nation not of family values, but of corporat e values; rather than well-supporte d parents and sweetly cared for young people, the bottom line is corporate profit. The point of all this is to acknowledge two related truths: (1) Parenting is a crucially important and valuable job, and (2) There is precious little support in our society for the job of parenting. This second truth is especially important to remember when it gets r eally hard and we fail to act according to the standards we hold for oursel ves as parents. When we'r e frustrated, impatient, scolding, disrespectful, patronizing, sarcastic, la cking good attention, we te nd to forget what a good job we've done, what sacrifices we're making, how tired we ar e, what we're up against. We"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":" 111 are apt to judge ourselves and conclude that it 's hard because something is wrong with us. The truth is that much of the time it's hard not be cause something is wrong wi th us, but because it's just plain hard. And it's especially hard because we are parenting in the contex t of a society that is highly distressed and generally not conducive to quality parenting and meeting family needs. You're doing a good job; no doubt y ou are passing on to your children as few of your own hurts as you possibly can. A Death Walk for Parents (and anyone who intends to stay close to our children) Another basic phenomenon is that much of what we see in this world is backward or upside down, like a mirror that reflects r eality in a distorted way. Remember that we are still coming out of a legacy that views the natural world and the nature of human bei ngs as flawed and sinful. The recent history of advice on how to care for child ren is founded on the belie f that human nature is basically bad: lazy, undi sciplined, wild, irresponsible, selfish, etc. Children must be tamed and civilized. Deep distrust and fear drive our desperate need to control our young people. While small segments of our society have made great progr ess in contradicting this conventional wisdom and our unconscious conditioning, there is still great pressure to “control your child.” Looks and gestures of disapproval from others are not unc ommon when you allow your child to complain, to tantrum, to whine, to talk back to you. Control or suppression of emotional expression is still a primary value in our society. What I propose in counseling our young people violates this valu e. To allow, honor, and encourage emotional expre ssion in our young people is a direct affront to external and internal advocates of em otional denial and self- control. The teaching that emot ional expression is a natural, bu ilt-in mechanism for healing the effects of being physically or emotionally hurt is not well understood or accepted by most of our society. Be prepared for a challenge. It takes great strengt h to violate a group no rm or expectation. As an illustration, Arnold Mindel l (1993) tells the story of a powerfu l, tribal mountain group that forced any member who violated a gro up law or norm to undergo a “Death Walk.” The offender had to pass through a gauntlet of tribal me mbers who took shots at him. One unlikely way to survive the Death Walk was if all the gunshot wounds did not kill you. Of particular interest was the rare individual who could “walk in su ch a way that the group members could not pull the trigger.” How"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 to walk in such a way is not clear. I suggest t hat, as a parent, it means clearing enough of your own shame that others' criticism of your parenting does not “kill” you. Be prepared to receive some shots—o f judgment, disapproval, doubt, and skepticism from others in your social group. Expect your own internal critics to begin shooting away at you as well with self-criticism, self-doubt, and that most distressing feeling of all, unhealed shame. The Principle of Unraveling Suppression Be warned that, once you decide to challenge the norm, it may very well get a lot worse before it gets much better . I haven't yet come up wit h the best name for this phenomenon, so I have called it “The Principle of Un raveling Suppression.” When matter or energy is compressed, a powerful, potential force is creat ed that needs to be released to avoid an explosion, the way a pressure cooker allows steam to escape. In order to heal, we must release or discharge our hurtful experiences through emotional expression. Hurt and loss ar e healed by crying; fear by shaking, trembling and sweati ng; anger by heat and vociferous expression; physical pain and tension by yawning. When a child 's natural inclination to expr ess feelings in these ways is suppressed, order and surfac e calm may eventually appear; the hurt, however, does not go away, even after many years. A part of the child may go into a chronic sho ck condition involving constricted awareness, emotional numbing and rest ricted range of emotional expression. Chronic physical tension and/or chronic alteration of physiological arousal system s will often occur. Limitations on the child's naturally flexible and creative intelligence are part and parce l of unhealed hurts. Suppression of feelings takes its toll. When the door is opened, when the pressure valve is released, it can get quite messy. Reactions appear to be over-reactions, out of proporti on to present time events, as they often are. A child is denied an ice cream cone and acts as if it were the end of the world. As a parent, you are accused by your child of al l manner of evil int ent and told that you don't care, that you never give her anything, that it's all your fault, that she hates you, and so forth. But if you understand that your child is using you as a co unselor to work on unresolved feelings of denial, frustration or rejection, then you can help your child enormously. When you are"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" 113 able to remain calm and loving, your child will heal through her stormy behavior. Remember that, no matter what she is saying, deep down she dearly loves you; she's simply working out some distress. Your Child Will Use You Human beings are extremely intelligent; young people are brilliant. They know, at a very deep level, to take advantage of good adult attention when it is available. Offer this to your child, and your child's natural intelligence and built-in mechanisms for heali ng will combine to take full advantage of this gift. He will use the slightest pr etext (e.g., you cut his pancake the “wrong” way) to express pain around a whole legacy of hurts and disappointments. Some of these may be past experiences with you; many you ac tually had nothing to do with. You may or may not discover the sources. Most likely you won't, but it really doesn't matter. What does matter is that you are assisting your child to release and heal the many hurts associated with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, the insults, frustrations and disappointments of a small being in an adult- oriented world. All this will test your mettle; I guarantee it. You will react and be imperfect, but don't be hard on yourself. Remember that you are doing important work, handling a very tough job in a very tough situation. Commend yourself for all you are doing. Safety One final piece remains to be considered in regards to th is phenomenon of your children “taking out” their problems on you. As I've al ready mentioned, a child, (and an adult for that matter) will use the safest person in her life to show and work on her greatest distresses, the places where it's really hard. Children (and adults) need safety in order to heal and grow. When it comes to letting it all hang out, it's going to be with Mom or Dad. Think about it this way: if not you, then who? Again, the outside is upside down from the insi de. Oftentimes, what looks and feels like disrespect is really a gift of trust coming from a pl ace of safety built on the child's knowing that you have shown him respect. He is using you as a coun selor because you are the safest person in his life. I know this is difficult and an ongoing chall enge. It's good to model respect. It's also good to expect respect. Consider, however, that when a child is using you as a counselor, that is not the time to think about courtesy and manners. Interrupti ng disrespectful patterns is good; they don't serve your child. Nevertheless, resist the urge to dismiss or suppress your child's need to work this stuff out with you. I'll say more about this in the upcoming section on anger.

Although we've made some progress in the last two gener ations in allowing children to express their feelings, we still have a long way to go. Such expressions as “Big boys don't cry,” “Stop that whining,” “Crybaby,” “Be a big girl ,” “Stop crying or I'll give yo u a reason to cry about,” and “Go to your room and come out when you're decent to be around,” are still commonplace in our society. That's what's on the outside. What 's inside is especially challe nging, often excruciating, for most of us. Think about yourself. How do you f eel when a baby is cryi ng or screaming? Is it comfortable for you or do you feel a need to get away or shut the baby up? Or do you desperately need to soothe, comfort, quiet the baby? What about an older child? Is it OK for babies, but not for an older child to keep crying? Do you hear an inner voice judging that as whining or manipulating? Does that inner voice sometimes leak out in a shaming voice to suppress the child? Do you ever feel a sickening sensation upon recognizing a tone or phrase that sounds like something your own parents would say? This last one never fails to humble me right down to the ground. It's difficult. Let's look at theory again. Reme mber the basic teaching that hurts go in and are stored in the body/psyche. Emotional expression is a natural, built-in mechanism fo r releasing and healing from the effects of these hurts. Crying is an especially impor tant expression for healing from hurt, loss, or disappointment. What makes this challenging for us is that we were taught and have learned to confuse the hurt with the discharge or heal ing expression of the hurt . We confuse crying with hurt. There are times, of course, when hurt and crying are simultaneous; for exampl e, a baby is acutely hungry or has a diaper pin sticking him in the bottom. So we check before we rule out physical causes. Most of the time, however, emotional expression is the healing or release ; the hurt is already in there. Think about a time when you've cri ed about someone you lov ed and lost. The loss is in the past; it happened, it's over, and you're still carrying t he hurt. The tears are a healing expression and"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" 116 working through of your grief. To try to think about it or to beat yourself up because you haven't gotten over it doesn't change the hurt. Usually it only delays the healing. So this is what happens. We confuse the hurt with th e discharge of the hur t. Having accepted a dull numbing as normal, we avoid the acute pain of feeling, expr essing and working through the hurt. Control Patterns As parents, we need to be able to recognize control patterns. Anything you do to or for your child to stop his crying is very likely a control patte rn. Anything your child does to control or stop her own crying is very likely an internalized cont rol pattern. Once a child learns that crying is upsetting to nearby adults and is discouraged or punished, she quickl y learns ways to put a halt to it. Please note that I'm not talking about the o ccasional need or desirab ility of pragmatic distraction or redirection of att ention; this is part and parcel of pa renting. When it is systematic, however, there is a problem. When there is insuffi cient time and space to encourage and allow the healing experience of emotional expression, there is a probl em. And any mechanism that enforces and ensures the perpetuity of this problem of suppressed emotion is a control pattern. Control patterns have many faces. Some appear benign: a toy, a joke, a game, or sending the child out to play. Some appear as parent res ources: a pacifier, educational programming, a Disney video. Some are recomm ended disciplinary techniques: “tim e-out,” banishment to the bedroom, loss of a privilege or, on the “positive” side, praises, rewa rds, gold stars, money, etc. Some appear harsh: spanking and ver bal shaming. Some appear under the guise of responsibility and maturity: “big boys don't cry,” “use your words, ” “you can handle that no w,” “I never saw tears get anything done.” It is probably quite obvious to you by now that I view the drugging of hundreds of thousands of children in our society as a mass societal co ntrol pattern, and a particularly dangerous one. For adults in our society, we hav e electroshock as a backup control pattern. Control patterns range from behaviors that are of themselves loving (feeding, comforting) and benign (joking, distracting) to the outright cruel ty of overt physical abuse. The prevalent use of pacifiers for infants and toddlers is a clear ex ample of how far we have gone to suppress our"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":" 117 children's feelings. What possible good is a pacifier other t han to promote docility, passivity and quietude in a child meant to express l oudly and boisterously much of the time? The best approaches I know to h andle this problem of control patte rns require giving your child time and attention. Be sure to spend your Special Time together doing what she wants to do . Rather than always attempting to soothe, distract or punish away your child's crying, move in close and take an interest, listen to and support him in his expression, keep bringing his attention back to the hurt, back to the situation, back to the complaint. I think this is especially important with boys who by a very early age are already internalizing our soci etal prohibition on crying for males. It is helpful to slow them down, to gently restrain them from bouncing up, brushing off the hurt and getting back into the game. Be aware of how well we re ward and celebrate our young male athletes for “playing with pain”; be aware of the shame and stigma on those who don't. Most of all, remember to take delight in your child's ability to heal by crying. You have learned that the emotional expression is not the hurt; it is the release of the hurt. The tear s are the healing. I recently received the gift of a poem by my friend Bill Jeffers that I want to share with you now. It conveys the spirit of The Wildest Colts wonderfully and illustrates the lesson of control patterns. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":" 118 DON'T BE NICE By Bill Jeffers Don't be nice. .

So we respond very differently to our child depending on our judgment of the situation. If it is a good enough reason (perhaps an obvi ous physical trauma like a brok en leg), we are supportive and understanding. If it's “nothing to cry about” (the proverbial sp ilt milk), we are impatient, shaming, scolding, admoni shing. Most of the time, however, t he truth of the matter is that our judgments are irrelevant to the child's needs. Our judgments refl ect our distress; they influence us"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" 121 to act in a way that reveals a fun damental distrust of our child's na tural intelligence and instincts to work on her needs. As a parent, your challenge is to extend trust and respect toward your child. The good news is that, in many ways, it really makes your job easier. You are relieved of the onerous burden of judging and evaluating the worthiness of your child's expressi on. Instead, you only need to keep showing up with good attention, relaxed confidenc e, and trust that your child will use you as a resource to work things out in the very best way. At the very best, we can only make semi- informed guesses as to the nature of our child's inner reality and w hat he is working on. Big tears about an “ apparently ” insignificant incident may mean there's something far from insignificant in that experience for her; or it ma y mean that he's using a trivial incident to counsel on something that happened at school that morn ing or with a neighbor last week. No matter. Relax, trust and enjoy your child. Congratulate yourself for being there. "},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 122 CHAPTER 12 Fear Whenever I think about fear, Geor gia O'Keefe immediately comes to mind. This magnificent artist was quoted as saying, “There was never a day in my life when I wasn't absolutely terrified, but it never kept me from doing anything I want ed to do!” What an amazing statement. There seems to be great confusi on in our society about fear. We extol fearlessness, placing great value on the person (generally a man) who “know s no fear.” At the same time, we tend to be very fearful and manifest this fear in how we treat our children. I challenge you to notice how often you say “Be careful” to your child. Think about it. Jean Liedloff, in The Continuum Concept , gives a wonderful illustrati on of childrearing in a nature-based tribal society. The children are free to range the edges of steep cliffs and fire pits without concern. They are expected to learn awareness, not caution. In our own society, we teach our children to be afraid. Notice the mailings and late ni ght TV spots depicting lost children. The impression is that childr en are in great danger of abduction; yet t he actual number of abductions is very small and, in fact, more than 90 percent of these so-cal led “abductions” are committed by parents who have been denied lega l custody. The way mass media handles “News” in this country saturates us with fear. S ensationalist journalis m takes a horrific incident from anywhere in the state, country or worl d and brings it into your home and into your mind. You feel as if these daily horrors were happening ri ght next door and you were i ndeed living in an extremely dangerous neighborhood. In our confusion about fear, we tend to think that we should not be afraid, yet we feel fear. This apparent contradiction leaves us feeling wrong and ashamed. Then we have not only fear to contend with, but also shame. This confused and shame-filled condition is reflected in our parenting. As with crying, we end up making judgments about what is a good enough reason to be afraid. What we judge to be a genuine threat is acceptable: a fierce pit bull dog shows up in your yard, and you comfort your child. A “silly” fear ( perhaps seeing an imaginary figure, perhaps falling off an 18-inch high stool, or asking a neighbor for a cup of milk), however, is lightly dismissed, laughed at or scorned. "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":" 123 Fearlessness—living without the f eeling of fear—is ce rtainly a wonderful state to experience. Yet we do know fear. Remember that bravery does not mean we ac t without fear. On the contrary, bravery means we act in spite of our fear. Did you know that the wo rd courage is of French derivation and means “big heart”? To be brave requires a big heart. It means you care enough to walk toward and through that which you fear. We think of fear as a result of our minds liv ing in the future and generate fear when we anticipate or expect bad things to happen. Perhaps you've heard t hat FEAR is an acronym for F antasy E xpectations A ppearing R eal. There is some truth in this, and it is reflected in the way we respond to our children's fears. It seems the most common adult reaction to children's fears is to reassure, reinterpret, ex plain away, logically show why t he fear is irrational: “You can't really hurt yourself falling 18 inches.”; “There really are no ghosts in the closet.”; “June bugs really don't bite.” One thing most people don't know about fear is that fear is more an emotional memory of threatening past experiences than it is about the future . For example, our intense fear of death comes not so much from our antic ipation of dying as it does from our memory of past experiences when we thought and felt that we might die (and, if you believe in reincarnation, where we did die). Our life and death struggle just to be born left a very powerful imprint on us. Another thing few people know is that fear has more to do wit h the body than with the mind. Fear is a tension held in the body as an unreleased memory of terrifying past experiences. Therefore, it is basically impossi ble to heal fear by talk. We ma y distract ourselves and focus our attentions elsewhere, but as wit h other hurts, healing of fear requires emotional expression. Fear is discharged from the body by shaking, trembling and sweating. Physical pushing is often necessary to unstick and release the frozen energy of fear; squeezing or holding on tight to someone usually helps; screamin g often helps, as well. The best way to help a child release fear is to have a relaxed, confident adult get in close and stay close . Safety, protection and physical closeness are essential to working with a child's fear. As with crying, or any emotion for that matt er, our adult judgment about a “good enough” reason is at best irrelevant and at worst do wnright harmful. Trust your child, be grateful that she is working this out and take pride in the fact that you have made it safe enough for her to counsel on this with you. "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" 124 Heavy Fears and Light Fears It is useful to make a distinction between hea vy fears and light fears. Much of what I just shared with you is about heavy fear: where a child is really stuck or frozen and just can't move, where you see that look of te rror flash on his face. If he shows anger, he needs to push against you. The discharge will be heavy: s haking, trembling, sweating. Light fears can often be worked with in a light way. They frequently show up as embarrassment. Because the discharge is much light er, they can often be dissolved by laughter. Use humor, play and silliness; your child will love it. For instance, if your daughter is afraid of climbing on an 18-inch ladder, you can make a great game of this by gently encouraging, celebrating and catching the child again and again. Or you climb and you fall; make it a big dramatic pratfall. Your child will laugh exuberantly as she watches you fall time after time. Dramatize! Be a ham! If your son is working on his fear of looking cl umsy while playing ball with his friends, make a game of it. You play and you be excruc iatingly embarrassed as you goof up. Let hi m laugh at you . This is the key: it is a great service to help your child work on his issues through you. Help Your Child We have the erroneous idea in our society that children should be able to work out their peer issues on their own. As always, truth is a double-edged sword: independence and dependence, overprotection and abandonment. It's good to be aware of the need to let your child work things out and have his own experiments, tr ials and mistakes. At the same time, as parents, we all too often take our child to the par k or some other play environmen t, send her off and expect her to handle what comes up while we take a well-deserved break. Well, she may handle it very we ll and she may not. Have you ever expected your child to easily manage an area that is excruciatingly difficult for you, or which you are simply not handling? Observing social interaction on the playground has been good for me, since I have struggled with shyness for some time. I still have a hard time with social play, especially with new people, so it's been a challenge for me to suppor t my children on this issue. "},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" 125 Our children need our help in social situations with their peers. It truly makes sense to be their ally at these times. Play with them and other ch ildren. Ask the other children's names, introduce them, initiate some play activity. Expect to be a magnet. Children will grav itate towards you as an adult who pays them attention, enj oys them, plays with them, has fun with them. Your child will love you for it, albeit, perhaps only after she works on her fear, humiliation and rejection by laughing at you, mocking you, acting indi fferent, or showing some other behavior. Be prepared also for this to be very hard at times. Any feelings you still have of embarrassment from past hurts and re jections will likely surface. Most of us adults have been hurt in such a way that, rather than being sheer joy, play is excruciating. LEARNING TO PLAY AG AIN MAY VERY WELL BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AN D POWERFUL ACTION WE CAN TAKE TO BECOME MO RE EFFECTIVE PARENTS, TO GET CLOSER TO OUR CHILDREN AND TO EXPERIENCE GREATER JOY IN OUR LIVES! It is important that you get su pport for yourself in learning to play. The Re-Evaluation Counseling Community is a great resource (see Res ource Section at end of bo ok). As hard as it is, it really is good news that by helping your child in play, yo u will help yourself enormously. Active, involved parenting is one of the most pow erful and effective ways on the planet to achieve personal growth. In order to help your child discharge and walk through fear, you must discharge and walk through fear. The best way to counsel your child on an area of distress is to challenge yourself in that same area. Take a Risk Remember Georgia O'Keefe. You hav e fear, but it is just a fee ling memory, an artifact of the past that is largely irrelevant except to indicate a place that needs specia l attention and healing. Don't let fear stop you. Take strong action and get good support to help you express and release the old hurts as you go along. I asked you earlier to notice how often you said “Be careful!” or some related admonition like “Watch out!”, “Play it safe!”, “Don 't hurt yourself!” or “Don't fall!” Did you know that children (and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":" 126 our own “inner children”) tend not to process negat ives? That means that “Don't fall!” becomes “Fall!” “Don't hurt yourself!” becomes “Hurt yourse lf!” Even more significant is that our energetic communication carries a much greater potency t han our words. Frequent admonitions of caution convey your expectation that yo ur child will be hurt or will hurt himself. Such messages tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies as your child trie s to oblige you by meeting your expectations. This point is most especially important with our daughters, since we are apt to cut our sons more slack. Generally speaking, with boys we need to do more pr otecting, cuddling, pulling them in close. With girls, however, we are required to do the opposite to combat the effects of gender conditioning in our society. With our daughters, we need to enc ourage boldness and adventure. When your child leaves the hous e, resist the temptation to advise caution and encourage her to be bold and brave by sending her off with a zest y “Take a Risk!” Replace “Be Careful.” with “BE AWARE!” Trust your child's intel ligence and judgment. Know that y our relaxed confidence will be rewarded as she counsels with you on the issues where it gets hard for her, and as she shares the richness of her life with you. Remind your children that they can play rough and tumble and get hurt and recover completely. Encourage your child to be aware, awake and fully alive. "},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":" 127 CHAPTER 13 Anger Our society also fosters many misconceptions about anger. Because fe w of us had healthy role models as children, most of us don't have a clue about how to handle anger when it arises in our relationships now, especially within our immediate fa milies. Think about your own parents and how they handled anger. Eith er it was such a potent force that we were not ev en allowed to acknowledge its existence, or we became victims of or witnesse s to the great harm caused by misdirected and inappropriate anger . Many of us were injur ed as children by big people expressing the hateful, hurtful energi es of their repressed rage. No wonder we are afraid of anger and conditioned to view and experienc e it as highly dangerous. No wo nder we get stuck here with our children. No wonder that one of the big gest challenges for parents is children's “disrespect.” I am convinced that this is the ar ea in which our parenting breaks dow n the most and where we most unleash our repressed anger on our children. It is one of the hardest problems to see clearly and change and one of the most distressed areas in our society. A good way to identify patterns of societal di stress is to notice wh en we most strongly experience feelings of shame, j udgments and disapproval. An d when is this? Most often it is when a child delays, questions, looks defiant, disobeys, talk s back, yells back, makes fun of, hits or hits back, or in some other way acts “disrespectfully .” These behaviors toward another child are “bad” enough, but when directed toward a parent or other adult evoke incredible feelings of shame, judgments and actions from the adults . Notice where you draw your own “line in the sand” on the ascending, but quite incomplete list of “disrespectfu l” behaviors that I just provided. Notice your judgments in relationship to yourself and your child . Notice also your judgm ents in relationship to other parents and their children. Ther e is a treasure here to be uncove red if you are feeling a little bold and adventurous. Notice what happens inside yourself when you ar e angry with your child. A basic teaching of Buddhism is that anger comes fr om blocked desire. When we des ire something and our desire is frustrated, we get angry. When we desire and expect a certain behav ior or attitude from our child"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" 128 and we don't get it, we get angry. When we desire to be seen by our friends as “good” parents of a “well-mannered” child and our child tal ks back, we get angry with our child. Parental Heaven and Hell There is a Zen story of a pilgri m who approached a master, asking him to reveal the nature of Heaven and Hell. The master, without hesitation, told the pilgrim how gross and stupid he was for asking such a question. The pilgri m was furious. His face became r ed and grotesquel y distorted in rage as he raised his sword to st rike the master dead. The mast er remained calm and without hesitation said, “That's Hell, ” whereupon the pilgrim was enli ghtened. His countenance was immediately transformed, and he bowed in deep, heartfelt gratitude. The mast er responded, “And that is Heaven.” I think as parents we all know Hell; it is when we are angry and disgusted with our children, when our sword is raised to gi ve them a “well-deserved” punishment. Think about what image you hold of a spiritual teacher; perhaps you envision a wise old Zen master or sage, the priest, pastor or minister of your church, perhaps a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King, Jr., or a Mother Teresa. Did you know that your child is one of your greatest spiritual teachers? There is no such being as a sinful, bad or wicked chil d. Any such feelings and judgments come from within you; they are from your own past. Parental hell is when you have banished painful feelings into your unconscious and you are projecting them onto your child. The pilgrim's intense fury was well justified at su ch an insult; his enlightenment came from the realization that his grot esque “hell” came from within. Your ch ild is your great spiritual teacher because, just as the Zen master, she brings this tr uth to your attention. You can slay your child with your sword of righteous ang er, shame and judgment; or you c an step back, count to 10 and resolve to work on your own inner hell. As with the pilgrim, the natural result of transcending this Hell is to enter the kingdom of Heaven. Parental heaven is when you see your child through the eyes of delight . Your attitude is one of joy, respect and heartfelt gratitude to be in the presence of such a wonderful being. You are probably familiar with the often quoted words of Jesus Chri st that we must become as little children to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Do you think he meant that only in reference to quiet, gentle, happy, obedient, well-mannered chil dren? Although we usually interpret this comparison in terms of innocence, trust and bei ng in the present moment, I think two of the greatest virtues children possess ar e their integrity and aut henticity. Yet, how much of our anger is"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 129 directed toward our children because they are not yet conditioned to be duplicitous, to lie, to be polite even when they ar e angry, to say “Yes, Sir” when they really don't agree, to smile and say “Thank You” when they don't feel grateful? Jesus im presses me as a man of integrity. Wasn't he crucified by an angry mob for his outspoken civil disobedience? As your great teacher, your child will show you, most vividly, the places where you are inauthentic or out of integrity. A spirited child will force you to either suppress him, or be ex cruciatingly honest with yourself when your words and deeds, or your words and feelings, are not congruent. On Desire The Buddha taught that there was suffering, that suffering came from desire, that Enlightenment, or liberation from suffering, came by letting go of desire. In the West, we come out of a Puritan ethic wher e desire is frowned upon; our insanely materialistic, consumer-oriented society is a wildly out-of-control caricature , a horrific shadow form of repressed desire. The messages we give our children about des ire, about needs and wa nts, are incredibly conflicted and confusing. On t he one hand, we constantly overwhel m them with gross materialistic excess—the media, the stores, entertainment, Gr andma and other relatives, birthdays, holidays. It's crazy. On the other hand, we shame them for bei ng greedy or selfish or “throwing a fit” when they don't get what they want, or more of what they already have. Non-attachment is, indeed, a co re teaching of spiritual development. It is not, however, recommended as a primary focus for child developmen t. This is a place for you to examine your own life as an adult, to figure out your own relations hip to this grossly mate rialistic society. Until you do this, you really don't have a ghost of a chance to provide a healthy ho me for your child and a healthy example for her to watch. This is Step One. It makes good sense to protect your children fr om the relentless onsl aught of consumer excess driven by perverted values of mindless gr eed and short-term profit. At the same time, we are deluded as parents if we think we can provide a glass bubble or pristine flower garden that will obviate the need for our child to struggle thr ough the confusing and hurtfu l effects of Western Civilization. As with your self, your child will need to be “in reco very from Western Civilization.” He can be in great shape to handle this, however, with you as thoughtful ally. "},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" 130 I think it is harmful and unwise to expect any degree of Buddhist-like non-attachment and equanimity from your young child. I also think it is harmful and unwise to give up, to passively surrender to the relentless forces of the ma rketplace and permissively allow all manner and amount of nonsensical media and products into your life, your child's life in particular. This is where active parenting can make the differ ence. I strongly recommend interruption and curtailment of media input (see section on TV). Give thought to food and other consumer activities and exert a positive influence on your child in that area. I urge you to think deeply about established holidays and perhaps discover alternative ce lebrations. Don't expect to figure it all out or to find a right and wrong way of doing it. Just keep thinki ng and share your thoughts with others. Include your child in experi menting to learn what works best. I think it is helpful and wise to expect your child to passionately desire everything and more of everything . The everythings come and go and are insi gnificant in any lasting sense. The passionate desire, however, is another story. Passion is to be treasured and celebrated. Passion means the ability to be affected. It is about relat edness, about caring. One of our greatest hurts is the suppression of our caring; it is our nature to deeply care about everyone and everything. ALL LIFE IS SACRED! How can we know this without passion? Say YES to your child's desire! Frequently say NO to the objects of her desire , but say it lightly, with delight. And don't expect your child to like it. On Disappointment I'll give you another key here to put in your parent survival h andbook; I think I first heard it put just this way by Dan Jones. You have two choices as a parent: either accept and embrace the fact that you will disappoint your child again and again and again, or go crazy! The nature of being human is to desire. As par ents, we are the ones wit h whom our children work out this inevitable suffering of frustrated desire. It is one of the primary dut ies in our job description. Counseling on Needs and Wants I want now to share a few more principles and techniques that I hope will be helpful. Getting back to anger, remember that frustration is a fo rm of anger and that anger is a basic emotion in the repertoire of our survival nature. Anything that interferes with getting our desires met is experienced as an insult and a th reat to our being. Remember that children are completely"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":" 131 intelligent, but highly inexperienced. Being in a body on this earth is new, confusing and uncertain. Growing up is challenging and ve ry often extremely frustrating. Remember also the idea of Adultism: adult's world, ch ildren's place. Take a close look and be amazed at how often your child is forced to accommodate himself to the needs and whims of adult schedules and demands: going to school, being here and there, doing this and that , none of which probably fits your child's agenda, timing or preference. I have seven suggestions in counseling your ch ild on desire, frustration and disappointment. (1) Make sure your own attention is good ; be relaxed, aware, av ailable. Don't try to counsel your child on this har d stuff when you're tense, angry or in some other way upset. (2) Encourage and allow emotional expression . Remember the hurt (frustration, disappointment) is already there; the expression of the hurt (tantru m, crying) is the release of the hurt. It's healing. (3) Keep reaching fo r your angry child. There is anger and it needs to be allowed and supported. Know, however, that underneath anger is hurt; fear and sadness are waiting to be shown and released. This is a r eally tough one. Children work out rejection (and this includes denial or rejection of their desires ) by rejecting back; you, of c ourse, are the safe st and therefore most likely target. Often a child will say “Go aw ay” or “Leave me alone,” and perhaps slam his door and hold it shut to keep you out. There are ti mes when a child needs some space, but such times are less frequent than you might imagine. Most of the time when y our child is angrily rejecting you is when he needs you the most. We are just beginni ng to understand that abandonment means much more than rejecting t he needs of a child who reaches for food or comfort; abandonment also applies to the ch ild who actively rejects and pushes you away. Your daughter may experience abandonment on a very deep level when you accept her rejecting declaration and leave her alone in her distress. She needs you to push against in order to work this thing out. She badly needs you to remember her true nature, that deep down inside she wants to be completely close to you. She needs you to remember this, to counsel her on her distress and not to confuse it with rea lity. Keep reaching for your angry child.

Please be sure you have very good support in place before you attempt to counsel your children in this way. (4) Get help in working with heavy anger. Get good, aware help . Remember to watch out for psychiatric pathologizi ng of your child's behavior. Wo rking with your child's anger is extremely difficult to do on your own, especially when the child is a bit older (by age 4 or 5). Children are strong and rage lends an unbelievably great deal to one' s physical power. Further, there is little so restimulating (bringing up one' s own distress, fear, anger, whatever) as your beloved child kicking, screaming, pulling your hair out , etc. It is so impor tant to have good adult allies here. I strongly recommend connecting wit h the great support and parenting information of the Re-Evaluation Couns eling Communities (see Re sources at end of book). (5) Protect your child from harming self, others, property . Your child needs protection at this time; she needs safety and control. It is your job as parent and counselor to prevent her from hurting herself, you, anyone or anything. It's called “I know you're angry, keep going, express it, and I'm not going to let you hit me, hurt me, bite me, kick me, pull my hair, tear your brother's face off, break my new lamp, your to y, his model airplane, . . ., etc.” Obviously this is easier said than done; the overall approach an d attitude is the key. Remember the underlying sweet and cooperative nature of y our child; stay relaxed and confident as you help her get this stuff out. That 's the ideal; we often can't meet the ideal. We need help and we need to remember that children don't need perfect parents; they need parents who keep thinking and never give up. So you do your best to provide safety and protect your child, your self and your property from harm. Yet harm will inevitably come ; anger is strong energy and you are not god, neither omnipotent nor imnipresent. My si xth suggestion is ex tremely important. (6) Counsel on fear of getting hurt, getting hit. This is a big one for many of us. We have been physically hurt; many of us were hit by our parents or others and not allowed to show how much it hurt, to fully discharge and heal. We have been conditioned to “Be careful,” to be timid, fearful. Women espec ially have been conditioned against physical power and active"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" 133 use of their bodies. For most women, a crucia l aspect of re-emergence and liberation from internalized sexism is to re claim physical power. The Re-Evalu ation Counseling Communities are one good resource for this work. Women' s martial arts can be another great approach. In any event, the idea is to counsel on anything that keeps you from reaching in for your child, in this case, your angry, physically powerfu l child. Remember that you can play rough and tumble, get hurt, and recover completely. (7) Remember that your child really doesn't want to hurt you or any one or anything. I know this is hard to believe in the midst of a full-blown tantrum or rage; nevertheless, it is an absolute truth. It is his distress talkin g; he's letting it all hang out and he desperate ly needs your help. He badly needs you to remember his true natu re and not confuse his toxic, hateful anger with who he really is. A big part of parenting is damage control: Gotta do it, never ending job, not much fun. Once the damage is done, it's usually too late to effe ctively counsel the wrongdo er. Once big brother clobbers his little sister, it's the sister who gets support. Even if we do manage not to shame brother too heavily, it's still very hard to counsel him—not just because of our anger or disappointment or overwhelm as parents, but because he will be high ly defensive. He feels so bad deep down that he does anything and everything to protect against th is feeling—more defiance, indifference, withdrawal, shut down, refusal to talk, guilt, you name it. A key to effective counseling is to interrupt the hurtful patte rn just before the actual hurt . If you can catch him just before he clobbers sister, you're in great s hape to work on this together. Then you stay in close and really pay attention. You let him know that you know he really doesn't want to hurt his sister. You encourage his expression. You may keep him just at arm's length as he tries to kill sister, or he may turn on you. You let him know that you're not going to let him hurt you. (If he gets in a punch and you have to stop, that's OK. Y ou'll get another chance, and this is the kind of work where we really do need help. In fact, I don't recommend you do this until you feel really strong in counseling your child on crying and fear, and until you've recl aimed the ability to pl ay and are having some good, close, affectionate time with your child. I also strongly recommend getting help .) As you remind him that you know he really doesn't want to hurt you, he may respond with a screaming “Yes I do! I want to tear your @#*#!@ face off!” Then you can give yourself an internal pat on the back for your good counseling! It's true; this heavy stuff looks awful and can be extremely hard, but it's such a gift to help a child get this out safely. "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" 134 Often times, your child will move from rage in to fear. I'm not talking about the light fears discharged through play; I'm talking about terror, heavy fear. Refer back to the previous chapter for advice on how to work with fear. Remember that the most important factor in helping a child release fear is to have a relaxed, confident adult who gets in close and stays close. A Note on Restraint In reading this chapter on anger, I'm sure you have noticed the cautionary emphasis about doing such intense work with your child. Permissi ve counseling is when you lend support and encouragement to a child who is hurting and who overtly wants your attention—holding a child in your lap while she cries or tells you about being afraid of the dark. Non-permissive counseling, however, is another story. The child is hurting, but she is telling you to go away and leave her alone. Non-permissive counseling is based on the premise that a child re ally needs and wants your attention even when overtl y saying she doesn't. Her overt re jection of your attention when she is hurting is usually an expression of distre ss; she really needs your help at this time. This book is about challengi ng the oppression and control of children. The concept of non- permissive counseling can easily be used as a tool for control or punishment. It requires great awareness and sensitivity to avoi d falling into this pit. Especia lly examine your motives and actions when you feel tense or irritable; remember that the attitudes of relaxed confidence and loving delight are the best indicators of a good time to counsel your child. I must acknowledge that it feels strange to emphasize caution; after all, I have throughout this book advised you to encourage your children to be bold and to take risks. I also encourage you to take risks in your parenting. Remember that ch ildren don't need perfect par ents and that they are robust. The keys are to stay awake and awar e, keep thinking and get lots of support. With all this in mind, I now directly address t he concept of restraint—holding a child, preventing his leaving, or his striking out at someone or something. Non-permi ssive by nature, restraint is a primary tool of coercive author ity. Police do it, soldiers do it, psychiatrists do it. Restraint is historically, and still today, mostly a practice of authoritar ian control. It easily serves that purpose with children. I feel like I could go on and on. What I want to make clear is that restraint can also be used with awareness and thoughtfulness to help a child release hurt and pain. In fact, I would"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":" 135 go so far as to say that restraint is at times a necessary technique for helping a child deal with heavy fear and anger. My advice about using restraint is as follows: (1) Make sure your attention is good—aware, thoughtful, relaxed, confident, loving—before you attempt to counsel yo ur child on strong feelings. (2) Get as much help and support as po ssible from other aware adults. (3) First try to exhau st permissive counseling strategies—talking, gentle attention, playfulness, expressions of concern, invitations to cl oseness, approaching the ch ild, light touch, etc. (4) Remember the inherent nature of your child—that she is inte lligent, cooperative and loving, and, underneath the distress, wants to be co mpletely close and affectionate with you. (5) Monitor your own emotions and attitudes—if at all possible, avoid counseling your child when you are tense, angry, needy or otherwise emotional ly stimulated. (6) Use the minimum amount of restraint required to ensure safety and to facilitate emotional expression. Holding a child too rigidly usua lly results in a shutdown of expression. Allow as much movement as possible withi n your protective holding —active struggle is usually most helpful in facilitating your child's emotional discharge. Beyond Words I have one last, most important po int to make about this type of work with children; it is WAY BEYOND WORDS. I am writing in an attempt to pr ovide a mental explanation of an intense physical and emotional experience, an experience to which we al l bring loads of conflicting feelings and values. You will not learn to do this work effect ively by reading this book. My final advice for those of you who want to try this approach is this: Find and participate with other adults who are doing this work. Let them be models for you and support you in counseling on t he feelings that such intense conflict and emot ional discharge bring up for you. The play groups and family workshops of the Re-Evaluation Counseli ng Community are the best places I know of to learn and practice counseling children. "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":" 136 CHAPTER 14 About Eric I had a very hard time with my son, Eric, w hen he was between the ages of 4 and 7. He was angry a lot, demanded a lot of attenti on, and was seldom content or satisfied. As a father, I was taxed to my limits again and ag ain, especially by his anger, def iance and obstinacy. A session might begin when I would interrupt hi s attempt to hit his li ttle sister or throw a toy or other object. When I stayed close and did not accept his rejection or allow him to isolate into his room or run away outside, he would turn his fury on me and hit me or pull my hair. I would do my best to thoughtfully restrain him, but I inevitably took some shots. I had some fear of him, but I think my biggest fear was about him—that he would never get through this, that he was and would be “emotionally disturbed,” that we were creating a monster. I was furious with him. There were times when I felt like killing him. By the grace of God, I never struck out at him, but I hav e to admit that there was a time or two when I was overzealous in restraining him during a session. I yelled at him more than I like to admit. In retrospect, this is what I think happened. His mother and I made Eric go to pre-school/day care when he clearly didn't want to. Many times over he furiously resisted as I carried him to the car and st rapped him into his carseat. Part of the difficulty was probably his parents' insecurity about being separated from him. I am sure, however, that an even greater part was Eric's spir ited fight for what he want ed and knew was best for him—to stay home! We finally accepted that and he has thrived. Only this year, at age 9, is Eric back in school and doing great! I am convince d that Eric would have been considered an ideal candidate for psychiatric labeling and druggi ng. Now his teacher considers him a model of good attention for t he other students! But as I take a deeper look at the struggle we we nt through, I am convinced that my own difficulty with anger was a big fa ctor. My anger was suppressed; I was a “passive passive” in many ways. I would sacrifice my own needs and wi thdraw from conflict. I have no doubt that Eric was picking up on and expressing my anger as well as his own. Children do that. "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" 137 It's also true that Eric was born angry. Though born at home wit h loving support and without drugs, his birth was hard. He had a big head and was stuck in hard labor for several hours. When he finally emerged, he was wide awake, aware and alert, and he looked intense, as if he'd been through a fight—which he had. Then he and his mo ther had difficulty getting the nursing established for a day, and Eric r aged and raged. What a relief when t hey finally got that handled! We were learning. Our daughter, Vanessa, had a much easier birth. She also got the benefit of the experience we had gain ed with Eric. Typically, we spent a gr eat deal more time in the attitude of “relaxed confidence” in Vanessa's earliest years than we had in Eric's. We were exposed to and learning good counseling theory as we went along with Eric. We liked what we saw and heard. It made good sense, but we were like a pilot program. We heard about people who allowed ch ildren to “be the boss,” to be “disre spectful” and “out-of-control,” but we had no real, live models to follow. It was ve ry hard to trust that our wild child, easily diagnosable by mental health prof essionals as some kind of “disru ptive behavior disorder,” would turn out loving, cooperative, swee t, sensitive and powerful in a good way. Now I can tell you in all truth and sincerity that this is exactly how I would describe my son, Eric. He is still a pistol and still challenging, and he is such a joy! But when he was angry, for so long and with such intensity, I often felt overwhelmed. As we counseled him during his angry sessions by physically restraining him, we began to see the fear flash on his face. He would star t to panic and say we were hurti ng him. He would have difficulty breathing and begin to choke. It ev entually became clear to me that he was working on his birth trauma. Fortunately I had a lot of experience counseling adults on birt h trauma, so I could see this and accept it. Even so, I promise you that counseling an aw are and cooperative adult is very different from counseling your own panicky child who is fighting you and projecting the whole experience onto you (blaming you). It was so hard. We had a lot of help or we wouldn't have been able to work with Eric the way we did. I want to share with you one more amazing phenom enon that kept surfacing in my work with Eric and continues today. Although it seemed that much of the ti me Eric was incredibly angry and difficult, the truth is his “big” sessions really only occupied a small percent age of his life. At the “worst” times, I'm sure that no more than 10 perc ent of the time was he directly confrontive and challenging. Even this amount was largely due to our inexperience an d uncertainty as parents in"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":" 138 effectively responding to and counseling him well . I know I have observed this same phenomenon in other parents. As difficult as Eric's emotional distress was to handle, it is ironic that his natural, undistressed state was really my greatest chall enge! This is hard to admit, but I bel ieve it's true. So much of the time, I felt (and honestly still do to some degree) that the only time I could be with Eric in a relaxed and comfortable way was when he was sick. (T his was especially true when I was suffering through an extended illness of my own, but it was generally tr ue at all times.) Eric's naturally robust energy, zest and power is in credible; he simply felt like wa y too much for me to handle. From these experiences has come the rea lization and acceptance of the profound but uncomfortable truth: Much of the suppression we do to our children is not in response to the hurts they show us; the greater part (and this definitely in cludes the drugging of our childr en) is our pathetic attempt to control, slow down, rein in their dynamic aliveness! But I haven't yet told you the most amazing part of all this—the realizat ion that possibly I am just like my son and that, as a child, I may have been as robus t, zestful, challenging, energetic and alive as he is now. I have noticed this phenomenon in other parents as well. For example, I have a friend who has long believed t hat she is very much like her s on, but very different from her daughter. It is her relationship with her daughter (like mine with Eric ) that's most challenging, however; this is where the emotional intensity lies and where the sparks tend to fly. Of special interest is the fact that as my friend is curr ently experiencing a major phase in her own personal growth, she has spontaneously awoken to the possibility that she r eally is quite like her daughter. The difference was that this woman's challe nging, robust aliveness had been so effectively suppressed as a child that it seemed completely fo reign and not a part of he r true nature. This is how it was for Eric and me. I still don't know how much like Eric I am. I do know that the very idea has been extremely useful in my own personal c ounseling and that recovering my own emotional energy has helped me relate to my son more effectively. Please get all the help you can. I am convinced that the years of intensive parenting were a major factor in my eventual divorce from Eric and Vanessa's mother.

"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":" 140 CHAPTER 15 Four Techniques I have said much about counseling theory and about various faces of emotional distress. This chapter offers four techniqu es that will help to bring this theory to life for you. (1) The Three Times (3X) Rule I learned this one by experience with my son, Er ic. There was a long period when he was often unhappy. I really tried to accommodate him, honor his desires, “correct for” the apparent rigidity in my own upbringing. Food and eating was a focal point where we worked this one out. I would prepare something for Eric, often something he had requested, but then I served it on the “wrong” plate, cut it up “wrong,” or poured the syrup “wrong,” or whatev er. The same phenomenon could happen with this toy or that toy, or this T-shirt or that underwear. It took me quite awhile, but I eventually learned to discern whet her or not Eric was expressing a genuine desire. I wanted to honor his preferences and not impose my own tastes or conditions on him. What I learned was that o ftentimes Eric's want, need or desire was unrelated to food or clothing or whatever the apparent task at hand. I say “apparen t” most deliberately because it became quite clear that no matter what I did or gave, no matter how I accommodated him, he was still angry and unsatisfied. Remember what I said earlier about disappointment; Eric was going to be disappointed no ma tter what I did. So eventually it dawned on me that Eric was clearly showing his real need at these times, which was to counsel on his disappointment and dissati sfaction, or to counsel on his felt rejections by actively rejecting whatever I might do for him. This was an extremely helpful insight for me, and I learned that I could use this 3x phenomenon as a rule of thumb. It works like th is. If I accommodate him three times and he is still griping, moaning, complaining, or verbally insulting me, then ther e's a very good chance this has little or nothing to do with food or clothes. If you are responsive to your child's expressed wishes and he is still out of sorts and ups et with you, then he is pro bably asking for, demanding, a counseling session. I use the 3x rule as a guide , especially when my own intuition is not very strong."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":" 141 At this point, it is better not to accommodate. It is the time to clearly say no and, with relaxed confidence, counsel your child by listening to her complain ts, encouraging her expression, acknowledging how hard and frustrating it is, or how greatly disappointed she is. If your attention is good, this is a great time to counsel your child because her distress is just right there and she is showing you how hard it is. (2) Encouraging Your Child's Desire This is an excellent tec hnique to use at the above juncture wh en you give a clear NO to your child's further requests or in general when you are clear and relaxed about a refusal of what your child wants. Remember what I said before; the direction is called Say YES to your child's desire while saying NO to the object of her desire. It's called “No, Darlin g we're not buying that new toy, but I can see you really want it.” This is the opposite of suppressing your child and making her wrong for wanting things so bad, judging her or tryi ng to socialize her out of being greedy, selfish, or materialistic. The idea is to encourage her to express how badly she wants it, how frustrated and disappointed she is t hat she can't have it because you won't buy it for her. Do not expect her to sympathize with your financial concerns! When y ou counsel this way, a key is not to distract your child so she won't think or feel about the desired object. This ma y be a useful ploy to get out of the store, but it is not counseling on the distress. Rather than distract, you keep gently bringing your child's attention back to her desire . Say things such as, “You really want that doll, don't you!” or “I'm sorry you can't have that toy you really want!” or “I know how much you want that neon telephone.” Sometimes, it is most helpful just to place a hand between your child and the desired object. You let her want it, allo w and encourage her reaching while y ou gently hold her back, just out of reach. There are times w hen a child will very effectively get her frustration out this way. So you encourage her expression, her greed, her lust, her dramatic heart-breaking suffering at not getting that neon telephone! Re member that it's really not about the neon telephone. She's working out her desire and frustrat ion. Counseling her this way w ill help her find a rational ground on which to stand in the midst of a society that so mindlessly drifts on the polluted waters of crass materialism! (3) Role Reversal"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":" 142 This means you play the child. This useful and versatile technique is best used when you sense that you can handle your ch ild's unmet desires with lightness. If your child is expressing heavy feelings, encourage that. But if the feelings are not so inte nse, you can try having fun with the situation. Be like a child; play with it. For example, say “I want i t! It's mine!” “No, it 's mine!” “No, you can't have it. MINE!” Wrestle over it. Have fun with it. Be greedy. Be silly. This can also mean that the child plays you, or a teacher or other aut hority with whom she is displeased. It means encouraging your child to imitate, make fun of or otherwise get into the character who is denying her desires. It will li kely mean that you allow and encourage a most “disrespectful” attitude toward aut hority on the part of your child. Re member that this is counseling to release emotional distress; it is not about the moral educat ion of your child. It can actually be great fun and can result in tremendous li ghtening up of the situation for your child. (4) Dramatized Grievances Encouraging your child to dramatize his anger when he feels wronged is very helpful. Let's say his teacher has acted unjustly; he is furious and he wants revenge. He wants to kill her. As individuals, our tendency is to be afraid of such intense rage and do whatever we can to discourage its expression. Particul arly as parents, we are strong ly affected when we see the face of unsocialized aggression in our sweet child. We may be afraid, asha med, or a ppalled and aghast. We may react with our own rage. Certainly we are concerned. This technique of dramatizing a grievance is a way to work wi th clearing and releasing your child's emotional energy. No judgment is necessary. For future reference, as your child's ally, you may wish to discern whether or not your child's grievance is part of an ongoing situation with which she needs help. For the purpose of this counseling moment, however, your judgments about the rightness of her rage are irrelevant. Some thing big is up for her and she needs to get it out. A dramatized grievance means to dramatize t he grievance. Act it out. Exaggerate it. Really get into it. If she wants to kill the teacher, enc ourage her to go into how and include the grisly details. Remember, however, that this is not your rage, your drama, so watch out about “stealing your child's thunder.” Relax. Reme mber your child's true loving and cooperative nature. Trust that expressing feelings, even rage, in a safe and appropriate way ( with you and not by stabbing the teacher or vandalizing the classr oom) will not lead your child to a homicidal future. Emotional"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":" 143 release in the presence of a loving , supportive ally/parent will do the opposite, in fact, by helping restore your child to her nat ural zest and intelligence. Addendum to Technique: Remi nders of Inher ent Reality These techniques can be very powerful. Better said, the distressing feelings which the techniques help release are often extremely intens e. The feelings distor t perception and promote confusion; residual thoughts relat ed to hurt or revenge can remain. It is very important to spend a little time with your child talking about the ex perience, fishing for the unclear residue or misperception that it is his fault. After a session, ask your child how he views the situation and the people involved. This is a great time to count eract two huge oppressions of children. One is inadequate information; use the opportunity to encourage the understand ing that people are always inherently good, but act in hurtful ways as a result of carrying unreleased distress from their own past hurts. Two is disrespect; disrespect l eads to internalized sh ame, the feeling that comes from a message that the child is to blame for being treated badly. Here is an opportunity to contradict this feeling by letting your child k now that there is never any reason for him to be treated badly and without respect. Remind him once again of his inherent goodness and lovability, and enjoy once more the vision of your child through the Eyes of Delight! "},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":" 144 CHAPTER 16 Working with Challenging Children in Schools and other Institutions. This book shares a lot of id eas about the nature and developm ent of children. I emphasize the role of adults who work with these young people. I share a few ideas about psychological distress and recovery and suggest a few approac hes, but I especially emphas ize the need for us adults to do what we need to do to be in a loving and thoughtful state of mind so that we can trust and effectively cooperate with the natura l tendencies of the ch ildren. Although I do share ideas about societal trends and instit utional structures---for example, Gatto’s ideas about schools—the book is mostly about psychology and relationships. This little chapter takes a different approach. One of my later life teachers is a man named Ed Young. Ed is a fellow psycholog ist. Like me, he became quite dis illusioned with the general trends in psychology and mental health, but in a very diffe rent path. One of Dr. Young’s first jobs as a psychologist was in a state mental hospital, w here he worked on a so-called “chronic” ward with those considered severely mentally ill—“schizophr enics” with extremely limited and stereotypical social roles and the like. They were all on hea vy doses of neuroleptic drugs that left them heavily sedated with zombie-like effects. The attitude, then, like now, is that t hese individuals would be chronic mental patients for life. Most of them lived t heir lifetime or for long terms in the state mental hospitals. The main difference is that nowadays the patients are more likely to live in assisted living or group homes. Ed’s assignment in that state mental hospital was unique, however, in that he was an assistant to a Superintendent who was a tr ue reformer, a man who changed the dynamics of the ward by treating the patients like real people. Ed had ever yone, patients and staf f, dress alike. He instituted self-governance for t he patients. He facilitated a lo t of group interaction, and created prosocial roles: job training, and other roles with staff-like responsib ilities. Ed’s approach certainly did contradict the basic belief that the best thes e severely mentally ill folks could do was to function at a low level on heavy dut y drugs. Therefore, when after just a couple of weeks, an observer could not tell the patients from the staf f without their medical char t, and when the “sick” individuals became “well” in such a short time and were able to function normally, get off their medications, and leave the hospital, Ed was si mply astounded. His entire professional belief"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" 145 system required an overhaul. Those of you reader s who have been through such an overhaul, at whatever level, know how trying and unsettling such a process can be! Dr. Young’s career took some dramatic turns ov er the years, but the heart of is that he went from institution to institut ion—psychiatric hospitals, adult pris ons and juvenile detention, to name a few, applying the same general philosophy. The pattern was that he was only invited in when the institutional l eadership was desperate enough to try anything. After a period of getting through the expected massive resistance to r adical change, each experience was met with dramatic success similar to the hospital situ ation just described. Visit the website, www.dredyoung.com, for a look at Ed’s story and ideas. One of the core ideas that Ed re-eva luated is that the main dynamics of behavior and behavioral change are within the indivi dual. Ed laughingly, or not, refe rs to psychology as “the cult of the individual.” His initial psychiatric hospital experience, and subsequently in the prison system, showed him differently. So Dr. Young’s life work was about changing institutions to bring about dramatic behavior change in those confined. Not satisf ied with merely doing it, Ed determined to figure out the dynamics and to de scribe them in a way that he could share and teach to others. The end result is his Natural Systems Institute, which can be studied at the website, www.thenaturalsystemsinstitute.org. The pr inciples apply to any school, institution, or other organization. Dr. Young developed one exemplary program in the mid-nineties fo r the Youth Village, a juvenile correctional inst itution for the most severe juvenile offenders of the Harris County, Texas Juvenile Probation Department. Th is program, called Stars and Stri pes, clearly shows that even the most wayward young people can be guided to re claim their inherent natur e if the program has a structure that elicits growth and maturity. ‘Stars and Stripes’ has consistently demonstrated very significant positive results compared to other Texa s juvenile correctional facilities. Performance indicators have demonstrated, over every year since its inauguration, a near zero rate of runaways; improved academic progr ess; far less incidence of viol ence; and, consequently, an abandonment of the use of mechanical restraint. The use of c hemical restraint, also known as psychiatric drugs, is used rarely and much less t han the typical juvenile correctional program in today’s world of ubiquitous drugging of the nation’s youth. In the context of our failed criminal justice system, it is of special si gnificance that the rate of recidi vism was dramatically reduced."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":" 146 Before describing key aspects of ‘Stars and Stripes’, let me first emphasize that however simple or appealing these concepts might be to our common sense, t hey typically meet at first with great resistance. Initially the staff complains that we are coddling the yo ung people; that it is just impractical as everyone is just too busy; that it is too complic ated; that it invites anarchy. These are just a few of the obj ections one might encount er while implementing the program in a new institution. Ed’s exper ience, nevertheless, is t hat if the program directo r-initiator is willing and takes the time to really hear and listen to the conc erns and objections made by the staff, it is very possible to gradually win people over. Listening to Ed, I am always impressed with how tickled and satisfied he is that folks do come around onc e they begin to see their successes and how the program really works. Typically, says Ed, his most vociferous objectors end up as his greatest allies! Again, refer to the natural systems website for instructions on how to implement these ideas in an organization. Just now, I will share five co re concepts that make the difference. Local Support Teams If we do only one thing on behalf of a young per son, it would be to have an older adult taking a genuine interest in their lives. This simple, yet profound practice gets the best results. Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education’s Ri sk and Resiliency program maintains that the primary intervention for children at risk is “one interested adult ot her than the child’s parent”. Young people do better when an older person takes an interest. In the Stars and Stripes program, every youth in the facility has a local support t eam of 2 or 3 adult staff members who talk with them regularly; listen to t hem; ask open-ended questions; and pr ovide them with ongoing support and encouragement. This approach is not about telli ng the young person what to do or how to do it. It is simply demonstrating an authentic inte rest and enthusiasm for the young person’s well- being and progress. Student Government Self-determination is a profound quality of our i nherent nature as human s, and a real key to success. Psychologist Arnold Mindell, of the Process Work Center in Portland, Oregon, taught me the aphorism that, “Unfair use of rank causes re venge.” Human nature rails against coercion and the undermining of autonomy. Young peop le dislike being controlled. T hey thrive with positive role"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" 147 models, and tend to appreciate limited, reasonabl e guidance and direction, but they will rebel, directly if safe and covertly if not safe. Ed tells a great story of the Harri s County youth who, prior to implementation of Stars and St ripes when the program was a ty pical Texas boot camp model, would obsequiously defer to author ity when present, but urinated a ll over the school’s computer keyboards when authority was absent! Anythi ng that thoughtfully supports autonomy and decision-making is one of the major keys to success. Student government takes time to initiate but in the long run it helps the institution run more efficiently and it really works to promote that needed sense of self-determination and community responsibility. Young people love being given official, respon sible roles. They love being entrusted with and taking responsibility and demonst rating their capacity for cooperation and mutual respect. Their social skills grow and flourish in this environment. Prosocial Roles Psychology knows, ever since Philip Zimbar do’s famous “Prison Experi ment” at Stanford, that the roles people take on are a ma jor determinant of their behavior . An institution that has a shortage of positive social roles fo r its members is asking for trouble. The possibilities here are as rich as your own imagination a nd creativity. Remember John Taylor Gatto, whose work I have profiled in this book—he was New Yo rk state teacher of the year a couple of times. His program was known as the guerrilla curriculum, meaning the students spent very little time at school—they were mostly in the field (community). A big par t of Gatto’s role involv ed engaging the community to find mentors and apprenticeships for his students. In this ki nd of environment, the students consistently excelled on tr aditional academic outcomes. Sim ilarly, at ‘Stars and Stripes’, there are real job opportunities and training for the resi dents. A key aspect of t he program is a structure in which advanced residents become mentors who are responsible for the success of less advanced residents, or apprentices. Residents advanc e through a series of le vels which are tied, not only to the individual’s own success, but to the success of those for whom he is responsible. They begin to understand that, “I succeed by ensuring the success of others”! This is also a basic tenet of The Outward Bound programs. Trained Resident Mediators Residents are trained in nonviolent conflict resolution or mediation. Th eir progress in mediation is also on the level track. Those residents who ar e most advanced in their mediation training are"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 supposed to exercise this skill by intervening in conflicts between residents instead of the staff doing so. What a great thing, as opposed to the adult enforcers always struggling to keep things under control. Karen Wagner deve loped and directed one of Massachusetts's first charter high schools, The Lowell Middlesex Academy Charter School, for students who had been labeled \"at- risk\". The school was very successful; Karen’s wo rk there and subsequent research indicates that when a successful mediation program is an integral part of the school or pr ogram culture it very quickly becomes superfluous. Many practitioners will a ttest to the fact that their mediators many times need to mock role play mediations to st ay in practice because their services become unnecessary after a short time. Maturity Coaching I love this last concept. It is a great contra st for a so-called mental hea lth professional like me, schooled in notions of psychopat hology and attendant psychotherapy. Maturity coaching is not about fixing a psychologically sick individual, nor the work of a non-sick expert who knows best. Rather, it is all about supporting the young pers on to set his own goals and figure out his own strategies for meeting those goal s. There is no “You s hould do it this way,” “I told you so.” Mistakes or failures are not j udged or criticized. A ‘Support Gr oup’, functioning somewhat like surrogate parents, simply acknowledges these mist akes or failures and instead focuses on what worked and what did not work. Most adults need some training and practice in adopting a non- judgmental, adult-adult manner of re lating to teenagers to perform this role. The young person evaluates himself and, in an adult manner, comes up with a revised goal an d strategy. Ultimately it is a relief and a joy to see young people flouris h as self-determined agent s of their own lives!

The Spoiled Family Outing Below is one more item from Patty Wipfler's wo rk, an excerpt from her booklet on “Crying.” Patty describes a phenomenon that is a huge, ongoing cha llenge and is like a rite of passage into parenthood. It has to do with the fact that, to quote Patty, “Happy Times Often Bring Up Unfinished Griefs.” As if to make parenting even more of a te st of character, children often choose happy, close times with you to bring up feelin gs of upset. I call this the “s poiled outing” phenomenon. You have just spent a happy day with your ch ildren, perhaps at the park or with their cousins, playing and doing the things they love. As you head fo r home, your children become unhappy and easily upset. They cry about having to sit in the back s eat, over your request that each child carry his own jacket, or because you've stopped at McDonalds, not Burger King. A parent's mood at moments like these tends to be gr im. “If this is how you act, I' m not bringing you to the park again!” What the children are actually doing is taking advantage of the extra feelings of safety and closeness they have gathered throughout the day. The backdrop of a day's satisfaction makes the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 imperfections in life stand out, like spaghetti stains on a white tablecloth. Because he's had such a happy day, your child now turns to address sadness he still carries. For your child, this is an efficient way to flush out stored upsets. If you don' t expect it, however, a “spoiled outing” can be frustrating or even infuriating. Once you realize that it happens li ke clockwork you are in a much better position to listen as your child cries his upsets into peace of mind. For instance, you can begin to head for home before all your energy is spent, knowing that alo ng the way there will be some constructive falling apart to be done. Words From Diane Shisk I close Part III of this book, On Counseling Child ren, by sharing with y ou a little list provided by Diane Shisk, another intern ational leader in the Re-Evaluat ion Counseling Community. It is taken from the October 1995 issue of Present Time, the Journal of the Re-Evaluation Counseling Communities. I think it is a wonderful summary of this work and a great guide to communicating with your children. Beloved Child, You Are Wanted Here are some things to communicate to your children everyday, in your own words, and in ways that communicate from you to them: You are wanted. I am very happy to have you in my life. I want you to be close with me forever. I love you. I will always love you. Noth ing will ever stop me from loving you. You can make a difference in any situation. Your feelings are important. I wa nt to know how you feel, no ma tter what the feelings are. You are unique and special. No one else is y ou.

"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" 153 APPENDIX A An Introduction to Patty Wipfler's Work (Taken from Listening to Parents, pp. 15 - 20) A Summary of Emotional Heali ng and Listening Partnerships To explain this healing process, we shall begin by talking about the liv es of children, because children are real experts at heali ng from upset feelings. We also refer to childhood because, if you are like most people, you wi ll find as you talk in your sessions that many of the tensions you now battle have their roots in your early years, when you were most easily hurt. People are naturally trusting, loving, cooperative and eager for challenges. Do you remember how t oddlers tend to approach their lives? They are ready for adventure the moment they wake up in the morning. They trust you and the other people they know, offering friendship and fun to anyone who wi ll play with them thoughtfully. They have boundless energy. Nothing daunts them. They can fa ll hundreds of times as they learn to walk and run, but they never even think of giving up. When you sweep the kitchen floor, they are right there, eager to do this important work. After they've pushed the broom around with great c oncentration, they are proud of themselves for a job well done. Their faith in their own goodness is strong. Their delight in life is enormous. Your confidence and pr ide in yourself was once this complete. Every hurt hits a young child hard. The minute you scold a toddler, it's as if his world has caved in. He might look stricken for a second, then burst out crying. Or if you get irritated and try to take his broom away, he might throw himself on the ground in a st ormy tantrum. When he is sunny and confident, there are few people who are more aware and alive than a t oddler. When he feels hur t, there are few people more completely unhappy. Even small incidents of hurt are deeply felt, an d can leave a lasting effect on a child. You probably remember how thor oughly hurt you felt at times when you were young. When you were a child, many incidents of hurt hit you hard. Children blame themselves for the hurts they suffer. When children get hurt by thoughtlessness, mi streatment or circumst ance, they are saddled with emotional tension caused by the hurt. A hurtful experience, no matter ho w insignificant it may"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":" 154 seem to an adult, always makes a child feel bad about himself. Children interpret the incidents that hurt them in a thor oughly personal way. They a ssume that the troubles that befall them are a sign that there is something very wrong with them. Hence, when a child is made fun of by a jealous sibling, t he child can't see that he is being hurt because his sibling is full of tension. He be lieves he is being called names because something about him really is \"stupid,\" \"dumb\" or \"bratty.\" Every time a child feels hurt, he internalizes a strong impression that something is wrong with him. This impressi on causes his behavior to lose flexibility, much like a pebble in your shoe hampers your stride as you walk. You, too, will tend to blame yourself for your difficultie s. You have been hurt through no fault of your own. However, because your troubles have endured, you are pulled to believe that your bad feelings and inability to th ink are \"just the way you are.\" Unhealed hurts leave scars in the fo rm of rigid, i rrational behavior . Every hurt that goes unres olved robs the child of some of his wonderfully flexible, inventive intelligence. For example, instead of resuming pl ay with his brother, the child who was called names might withdraw from him or become consist ently aggressive in his own defense. The child will lose his ability to notice the times when his brother is relaxed and able to play well with him. The stored hurts cut the child's behavior options down to one or two set approaches. They block his ability to understand the nuances of the present situation. Instead of learning, he is set up to react in a stereotyped way, because of the unhealed hurt of earlier incidents. Children naturally know ho w to heal from a hurt. If a child has a parent who will stop, listen and st ay close when things go wrong, he will do his best to shed the bad feelings he is saddled with. He will cry if he is sad, tremble and perspire and struggle if he has been fri ghtened, have a tantrum if he is frustrated, laugh away his light fears and embarrassments, and yawn to re lease physical tension. As th ese somewhat messy and time- consuming activities take place, the hurtful impre ssion left by the incident (for example, \"What you want is unimportant,\" \"You are t oo much trouble,\" \"Brother can't stand you\") is gradually erased from the child's experience. If he is allowed to cry, tremble, and storm all the way through the upset, his full confidence and pleas ure in himself will return. W hen he is finished, he sees the hurtful incident as a harmless glitch in his life, not as a permanent setback. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":" 155 For example, I know two brothers who were two and four when they decided to race each other. Their mother was outside too, playing attentively with them. The older brother won the first race, and the mother cheered for him, and then em braced the younger son, telling him that he had run very well. They raced again, and this time, the younger son w on. The mother came over and hugged him with warm congratulations for coming in first. He turned to her and burst into tears, saying \"No! No! No, Mommy !\" The mother continued to hold hi m, mystified by his outburst. She didn't understand what he meant by \"No!\" so she listened and told him now and then that she was glad he came in first. Finally, he looked at her and said, \"No, I'm second! Tommy is first, and I'm second!\" He continued to cry hard, while she repeat ed a few more times that he had come in first, and that his brother had been second. After 15 minutes, he stopped crying , relaxed with her a minute, and asked, \"Was I first?\" When his mother answered \"Yes,\" he went off serenely to play. What had happened? Over time, t he younger child had internalized the rigid impression that he was always second, and carried some sadness about his supposed limitation. When he won the race and his mother was de lighted, the feelings of hurt behind this rigid impression were contradicted, or counterbalanced, by the reality of coming in first. He cried hard, because his put- down of himself could no longer exist side-by-side wit h his clear victory. Str ong feelings were shed and the hurt was lifted. He was t hen able to gain the fresh under standing that he, the second child, could actually be \"first.\" Th is is how the healing process works. Like children, when adults laugh, cry, tremble and perspire, ha ve a tantrum, or yawn while they talk about their troubles, they are relieved of the tensions associated with those hurts. Their ability to think and act more flexibly is restored. T hey become more reasonable, more fun-loving, more sure that t hey are good people, inside and out. The healing process is often interrupted. Under most circumstances, adults rarely find enough safety to use this simple, powerful healing process. Most of us had parents who thought that it was t heir responsibility to stop our deeply felt emotions, or who look ed upon this healing process as \"misbehavior.\" We had to learn to stop ourselves from crying, having tantrums , and showing our fear. With no chance to shed feelings of upset, we had greater and greater di fficulty recovering our self-respect and enthusiasm for life each time we were hurt. "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":" 156 Although you don't often see adults making use of it, this healing process is natural. Every child is born knowing how to use it. Every infant assu mes that her parents will list en with care while she cries through her upsets at the end of each challenging day. The listening partnership is an environment in which an adult can re learn the use of this natural process, and put it to work to resolve the tensions that interf ere with loving, playi ng, learning, and taking full charge of life. Listening gets this healing process started. The listening partnership cr eates a framework in which, much of the time, this healing process begins by itself. Simple, respectful listening, over a period of time, allows a person to come to trust the listener. This trust gradually a llows the client to lo osen the tight control she has had to keep over her tears, tremb ling, and laughter. To get the healing process started, simply keep your attention on your listening partner in a friendly and persistent way, session after listening session. Your attitudes of love, respect, affection, hope, delight, and confidence to ward your client will powerfully contradict the impressi ons left by the hurtful experiences in her life. For example, with you there letting her know she's good and courageous, y our client won't be able to blindly assume that she is a timid person. S he can perspire and laugh as she ma kes plans to speak up for the first time at the upcoming parent meeting at her child's school. With you telling him confidently that he is a loving father, your client might at first laugh in disbelie f, but soon begin to cry because he trusts you, and you have brought into question his rigid conviction that he is entirely to blame for his child's difficulties. To repeat: the attitudes an attentive counse lor adopts toward the client are a powerful force in a listening partnership session. These attitudes, consistently hel d over time, provi de the client with the support she lacked when she was first hit by hur t. As she talks about her difficulties now, your attention fills an unmet need. The healing proce ss that was interrupted for lack of a committed listener many years ago can now proceed at last. This process of tension release takes ti me, but it is very dependabl e. With enough release of emotional tension, adults can tr ansform their approach and attitudes in life very thoroughly, from the inside out. They can overcome irrationalities that have burdened them si nce their early years. After several listening sessions, you will probably find that, now a nd again, your listening partner has begun to laugh, tremble and persp ire, tantrum, cry, or yawn.

School trains children to be employees and consumers; teach your own to be leaders and adventurers. School trains child ren to obey reflexively; teach your own to think critically and independently. Well-sc hooled kids have a low threshold for boredom; help your own to develop an inner life so that they’ll never be bored. Urge them to take on the serious material, the grown-up material, in history, literat ure, philosophy, music, art, economics, theology — all the stuff schoolt eachers know well enough to avoid. Challenge your kids with plenty of solitude so that th ey can learn to enjoy their own company, to conduct inner dialogues.
