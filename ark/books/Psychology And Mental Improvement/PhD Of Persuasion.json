This book explores all the hidden techniques of influence employed by compliance specialists, professional negotiators and neurolinguists. It reveals strategies, from the benevolent to the unethical, which promise compliance from those it is used upon. Many of the techniques contained herein developed from centuries of human evolution. To survive, man learned to convince others to his way of thinking. A man either commands, or submits. Greater advantages can be reaped by the leader of a commune; this makes mastery over others so seductive. This need to dominate spawned in man a natural tendency to exert influence over his neighbors. The skill to influence exists in varying potencies within everyone. This book labels the various methods of persuasion, influence and attraction. It also defines the optimal procedure to put these \"weapons of influence\" to bear. There are many powerful techniques! Some techniques come from modern company strategies geared to increase sales. Most production-oriented firms developed subtle but devastating techniques to override resistance from customers and elicit favorable responses. Other techniques, however, developed in the clinics of neurolinguists. These scientists make it their sole business to develop the art of persuasion. Through prescribed language patterns and subtle body postures, they advanced powerful methods that can endow anyone with the power to convince masterfully. Great lovers and master sociologists have also contributed to the arsenal of techniques.

Driving Force Rapport Verbal Persuasion Understanding Body language Body Language vs. Verbal Language Are you frustrated by lies - white or otherwise? Deliberately misrepresented information, concealed emotions, and hidden motives wreck havoc on daily conversations as well as on critical business negotiations. Most individuals cannot detect poisoned facts smothered with silken words and laced with an impressive vocal tone. Well-placed words hide duplicity so well that even average individuals get away with it. Concealing fabrications with words is easy. No doubt, even a child can do it. For the layman, trying to detect lies by analyzing the words that carry them is futile. Judging the validity of a statement based on the sentence structure cannot yield much unless one wields background knowledge of the topic in question. But while verbal language can hide the truth, body language cannot. Note how our speech is peppered with colorful speech like Recoil in anger l Grit his teeth l Freeze with terror l Tremble with rage l Shudder with fear. l The body conveys how a person feels. Someone doesn't say \"I'm shaking in fear\". His body does this automatically to convey that he is indeed afraid. The body reveals more than such obvious emotions, however.

It bares and reveals innermost thoughts. Anyone can tell a tall tale in a flat tone and appear credible. The tongue is so glib it can make the most outrageous appear factual. The body is not as endowed in trickery, however. Your tongue may say one thing, and your body may say the exact opposite. It very rarely lies. Studying the body can identify whether an individual believes in what he utters. It also reveals how he may feel at the moment. In fact, it lays before you an entire range of emotions unconveyed by his faculty of speech. But understanding body language does more than help identify the current mental state of others. Expert knowledge of this nonverbal form of communication empowers you to project any image desired. This is where its study becomes so invaluable. Body language helps set the appropriate environment to persuasion. A master uses body language to subliminally influence his prospects. He creates irresistible messages that subconsciously persuade and control. Through special gestures, he communicates in a very subtle, yet forceful way. By combining verbal persuasion with subtle non-verbal persuasion, compliance becomes all too easy to obtain. Body language can identify you as calm, confident, and credible. Just as easily, it can reveal you to be shaky, unstable and questionable. The objective is to use body language that identifies you as cooperative, likeable, charming and authoritative. Three Powerful Benefits You Gain From Body Language Mastery You quickly identify the hidden emotions of others. Negotiations become easier when you instantaneously identify areas of discussion that causes discomfort. Normally, emotions are kept in check. Disagreement, for instance, can be manifested externally by continuous rejection of an idea. Body language pinpoints right away the topic provoking uneasiness and causing the rejection of valid ideas. Once identified, the area of concern can be subjected to compromise. l Body Language 101 file:///D|/pdf/body1.htm (2 of 6) [12/28/2000 1:48:33 PM]"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"You armor yourself with a perfectly tailored image. By knowing which body language adds or detracts from your desired image, you create the perfect \"you\" in the eyes of others. l You can create an environment of instant rapport between yourself and your prospects by adopting bodily postures that subtly conveys openness, trustworthiness, confidence and credibility. l Grasping the fundamentals and the benefits now empowers you to start using the potent force of body language. How to “Listen” with the Eyes The cardinal rule when reading the body is to look out for a coherent cluster of any of the following: Facial expressions l Gestures, body movements l Tone of voice/ pace of voice l Taken by themselves, individual expressions or gestures mean nothing. But a group of them, occurring simultaneously, can positively identify significant emotions. Take its analogy in verbal communications where a word conveys nothing; a sentence says something. In non-verbal communications, a cluster of gestures and expressions which all betray a single disposition strongly indicate the current mood or mindset of your prospect. Before concluding that someone experiences a certain emotion, check the whole range of gestures, expressions and tones of voice. Ensure that the facial expressions, gesture and voice tone all reveal the same message and do not give conflicting signals. Once you discern your prospect’s disposition, you will know exactly how to modify your approach. The following sections cover: The specific body parts and its hidden language. l The emotions conveyed by certain body language clusters. l Body Language 101 file:///D|/pdf/body1.htm (3 of 6) [12/28/2000 1:48:33 PM]"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":" Brief Body Language Alphabet Body Language of the Head Eyes Direct eye contact occurring 60% of the time indicates that the prospect is very interested in what you have to say. Eye contact occurring 80% of the time tells that the prospect is interested in you sexually. 100% eye contact indicates aggression. Be forewarned of resistance. Frequent avoidance of eye contact reveals that a prospect may be hiding something. It may also reveal subordination and lack of confidence. Dilated pupils indicate great interest, either in what you said or in you. Lock eye contact with a woman's gaze. If she drops it instantly and gazes downward to the left or to the right, it indicates that she is interested in you. If, on the other hand, she merely glances to the left or the right (without first dropping her eyes) in order to avoid your gaze, she simply finds you uninteresting. Rapid blinking is a warning sign. If it forewarns that your prospect may provide resistance to what you have just said. The Head When your prospect's head is tilted towards you, it indicates his interest. When his head is tilted away at an angle, such that he glances from the corner of his eye, he sends signals of suspicion, mistrust and disbelief. Be forewarned; he doesn't find your idea appealing. The head, supported on the hand indicates boredom. Nodding indicates interest and agreement. It is a good sign. Someone who keeps looking around says \"let me go.\" Body Language of the Hands The hand holds telling stories... When a prospect's hands are open and palms up, he conveys truthfulness and openness.

Hidden palms indicate something held back. Clenched hands indicate tension, discomfort or anger. The hand, when placed to cover the mouth or the nose or to tug at the ear, reports that a lie may be concealed. A limp handshake palm up betrays submission. A firm handshake palm down conveys strength and confidence. A hand gripping the other hand, wrist or elbow attests a desire to quell rising anxiety. Change your tact or risk killing the conversation! A hand behind the head betrays a need to fend anxiety, danger or discomfort. Steepled hands bear power and proclaims confidence and business. The hand stroking the chin indicates ongoing evaluation of something just said. The hands flat on the table indicate readiness to agree. The hands clenched behind the back project a desire to show control and power. The foot, when tapping, says \"Let me speak\" or \"I am bored.\" Hands on the hips show a defiant, commanding demeanor. Body Language of the Arms The arms can communicate aggression. When crossed across the chest, it signifies resistance to the conversation or to the speaker. Body Language of the Torso When the prospect leans towards you he sends signals of interest. By leaning away, he announces disinterest or resistance. A prospect sucking in his belly betrays signals of sexual interest. Body Language of the Legs When a prospect 's feet points at you it indicates that he is interested in what you are saying.

Authoritative people audibly and punctuate sentences with a period. To convey even more power, they speak at a pace much slower than normal. In contrast, a tone that increases in speed and rises in pitch indicates escalating nervousness and perhaps that something is hidden. Avoid this at all costs. It betrays a weak position and that someone is lying. [ Home ] [ Up ] Send mail to Joseph R Plazo with questions or comments about this book.

Driving Force Rapport Verbal Persuasion Instant Impact Emotions Conveyed by Body Language Clusters To persuade someone, you must use body language that conveys not just openness, but authority as well. Great care must be taken to avoid body language that betrays anxiety, suspicion, resistance or untrustworthiness. By allowing your prospect to perceive you as likeable and competent, on a subtle level, you gain compliance with your persuasion. Detecting Resistance to Your Idea Resistance can be easily detected in your prospect. Check if your companion's body, leans away from you. Observe whether he faces you obliquely. His arms, legs or both are crossed. He may glance from the corner of the eye; furthermore, eye contact is minimal. He taps his finger or foot; his feet points away from you. He may refuse to unbutton his jacket. Generally, the posture is closed and leans away from you. When you persuade, avoid adopting this body language. When your prospect adopts this pose, modify your tact to bring ease. Whatever you are saying may be causing discomfort. Body Language Depicting Openess to Your Idea An accommodating prospect adopts an open posture to signify acceptance. He indulges in considerable eye contact. He frequently strokes his chin. His hands may be steepled. Notice that his feet point towards you. This body language cluster promotes an ambiance of openness between both parties. This is an ideal posture to adopt for persuasion.

Once both of you adopt this posture, agreement is inevitable. Body Language Depicting Depicting Readiness to Agree / Cooperation Cooperation is signified by a prospect when eye contact occurs 70% of the time. Smiling is frequent. A cooperative prospect leans and tilts his head towards you. He faces you directly; he nods frequently. His hands may be flat upon the table. His palms may be open and visible while his arms and legs are uncrossed. His feet face towards you. He may also sit at the edge of the chair. A cooperative prospect exhibits body posture that is generally open and he leans towards your direction. As with the \"Evaluating Your Idea\" pose, this body language cluster boosts your chances of successful persuasion. Apply it when listening and speaking. Detecting Suspicion Suspicion is conveyed by a closed posture. The prospect may keep his hands in his pockets and orient his body and feet oblique to yours. He may look at you from the corner of his eye and cross his arms. Those who adopt this posture cease listening and tend to be disagreeable. It is hard to convince those who adopt this pose. When influencing, avoid taking this pose. Prospects will reject you if you do. It is hard to believe in someone who manifests suspicion. Detecting Lying Recognizing liars takes little effort. When someone lies, he minimizes eye contact. He is usually downcast. A lying person glances from the corner of the eye. You can also spot dubious statements by watching hand movements. Notice when someone’s hand covers the mouth, rubs the nose or tugs the ear – it betrays something fishy. A liar experiences obvious discomfort; he may shift in his seat or shuffle his feet. His feet may point towards a door signifying a desire to escape interrogation. Never take this posture when persuading. No one likes liars. No one follows the suggestions of liars.

Eye contact is steady and frequent; it never drops below the bridge of the nose. His shoulders are thrown back slightly, with the chin up. His posture is erect, yet comfortable. Movements are slow and deliberate. The tone of voice flows deep and resonant; speech does not exceed 100 words per minute. Each sentence ends with a downward inflection; pauses punctuate phrases and sentences. Every statement sounds like a statement and not a question (upward inflection). Even questions sound like statements. Normally, the leader takes the head of the table. When he sits, he may steeple When standing, his arms may be held behind his back. He may also rest them on his hips. Gestures are emphatic and carried out in sweeping or thrusting motions. His overall aura emanates sizzling power. This is the best pose to adopt for persuasion. The Power of Body Language Everyone communicates through body language. While we may be consciously unaware of the meaning of body language, we are subconsciously fully cognizant of its message. We react to how someone behaves before us on a subliminal level. For instance, we automatically feel uneasy if our companion crosses his arms and legs and narrows his eyes. Subconsciously we interpret the body signals as beacons of resistance, even though we may never have studied this arcane subject. The resistance of our partner tends to incubate resistance within ourselves as well; this causes us to cross our arms and legs in order to \"protect ourselves.\" The cycle of resistance ensues. The subsequent failure of the conversation looms imminently. Being knowledgeable of body language grants greater control to those wishing to influence any conversational ambiance. Through our actions we can set the tone - positive or negative - of any negotiation, meeting or one-on-one conversation. A master of this art will always adopt an open, non-hostile body posture to encourage cooperation. Also, he will scrutinize his partner's body posture for signs of discomfiture in order to reassess topics that cause unease. Knowledge of body language minimizes conflict and allows conversationalists to be sensitive to each other's needs.

This ownership grants us specific rights -- they endow us with dignity. Dignity demands an obligation to safeguard our rights. No one can impinge upon them. Others possess these very same rights. We cannot encroach upon these rights. While we expect others to respect our rights, we must also respect others. This principle enshrines the core of assertive behavior. Assertive behavior sows confidence. Confidence prevents us from yielding weakly in the face of pressure and it puts our needs forward. Anytime, anywhere. We feel good about ourselves because we send a clear message as to how people should treat us. Assertive behaviour requires that we act politely, reasonable and objective. Assertive behaviour requires that we let others know exactly what we want and feel. As a natural consequence, persuasion cannot occur in the absence of assertive behavior. To convince others, we must be naturally assertive. A weakling cannot sway the mind of an opponent. Victorious persuasion can be easy. First, know your rights. Be aware of where you stand. Then deploy the tools of scientific persuasion. Be forcefully assertive. The first shot fired in the war of wills comes only after invoking the proper mental disposition - through assertiveness.

The following techniques enable you to parry such people and deal with common tough situations. Getting Compliance to a Justified Request The Broken Record Technique Have you ever stated a request and were turned down? Did it frustrate you to receive a no to a perfectly legitimate petition? The Broken Record Technique allows you to gain compliance. Many of us have unknowingly employed it before. Applying it is easy. Here is the secret: simply decide on the desired outcome then unceasingly repeat the request or statement geared to spawn that desired outcome until you get it . While using this verbal tool, maintain firm determination and an unwavering tone tempered with politeness. Where possible, rephrase the statement each time to avoid awkwardness.

Here's an example. Valan, a 4th year medical student, can no longer tolerate his roommate's messy attitude. His dorm rivals a dumpsite because of littered cans and unwashed underwear. He resolves to end the matter via dialogue. Valan : I can no longer concentrate in this room. Everything is topsy turvey. Since this is you mess, kindly attend to it now. Marick : I don't have time. I'm sleepy right now and have an exam tomorrow. Valan : I understand that you would like to sleep, but please fix the room first. Marick : I'd rather do that tomorrow after I'm well rested. Valan : I appreciate that you don't feel up to it, but I want the room done today. Marick : Oh, c-mon. cut me some slack. Aren't teen-agers supposed to be messy now and then? Valan : I hear you. We are teen-agers, but we aren't messy ones. And I'd like this room done today. Please. Marick : Okay okay. Don't you realize you sound like a broken record? I'll do it. Valan : I realize that. But thanks for agreeing to fix the room. Handling Criticism The Clouding Technique We all hate criticism. It stings, it scathes. It hurts. It comes our way at least once a day. We can deal with it emotionally, escalate it and risk fraying a relationship. The alternative is to handle it assertively. The Clouding Criticism Technique defangs fighting words. To \"cloud\" the criticism is to diffuse it's potential for all out verbal war. The criticism is taken, absorbed, and rendered impotent. Rolling with the punches in this manner yields more results than countering with outright denial. Assert 102 file:///D|/pdf/assert_102.htm (2 of 5) [12/28/2000 1:48:34 PM]"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"To cloud the criticism takes six steps: From the very beginning, focus on the content of the criticism , not the behavior of the critic. Listen emotionlessly. Yielding to emotion leaves you vulnerable to further criticism. Anger and fury attract further criticism as blood lures sharks. l Calmly let the opponent talk till satisfied. Allow him to vent his ire into the stream of criticism. Do not interrupt. Be stone-cold silent. This allows him to assuage his fury and gives you the time to assemble a well crafted rebuttal, if need be. Allowing the opponent to lash out unhindered drains him emotionally, leaving him open to a well planned counter-attack. l Eliminate all embers. To further decreases his emotional turmoil and kill the fire, ask if there is anything else they might want to add. l Acknowledge having heard it. State \"I understand that you are concerned about...\" This negates the danger of letting the criticism looming indefinitely in everyone's mind. l Cloud the Statements. Take the criticism and AGREE with it partially or in principle. This is a very effective method to derail any follow up attacks meant to reinforce angry words. By rolling with the punches instead of countering, you foster a friendlier environment. Agree with some truth in the criticism. Here's the technique: l Clouding the Criticism by Agreeing Partially entails taking his criticism and agreeing with some parts of it. This is effective when being criticized with words that involve sweeping adjectives like \"always, never, and forever. Through partial agreement, the attacker's fury diminishes and this leads to more open discussion. For example: Criticism : You're always out of town. You never see your friends anymore. Reply : I agree. I have little time for my friends these days. (agreeing partially) Clouding the Criticism by Agreeing in Principle , entails fully agreeing with the principle of the criticism but not with the accusation leveraged against you. You admit that the principle is valid, but you nimbly sidestep blame. Agreeing in Principle lessens conflict because the critic gets confused with the quick acceptance of his point.

Before he can think of a reply, you can work to defuse further conflict. Criticism : You're always out of town. You never see your friends anymore. Reply : I agree. Distance takes away much time for friends. (you agree that out of town trips minimizes time with friends; however you don't accept fault.) Finally, after clouding the criticism, ask what would make things better. Tell him \"What would make this situation better for both of us?\" Listen to the reply and give your own input. The last step snuffs all residual negativity and focuses the situation of problem solving. If outright lies pepper the criticism use a secret technique. The technique of Presuming Innocence parries the criticism while allowing the critic to save face. l The Technique: Rapport cannot be built by pointing out errors in the logic of the criticism leveraged against you. Allow your prospects to save face by asking questions until you lose imagination or control. Presuming Innocence calls for incessant interrogation of the opponent on the reason, motive, factual basis, etc. for his accusation. Say, for instance, \"How does that relate to the . . .\" (then state the apparently conflicting information). Sometimes, you might find you were wrong, and you \"save face.\" Or, by continued non threatening questions, you can gently corner the other person into self-correcting.

Remember always, that each one has the right to say no. When pressured for an unwanted \"yes\", practice the Broken Record technique when declining with a no. Repeat your no's with as few excuses as possible. While doing so, keep in mind the cost (such as time, stress, resources) an unwanted \"yes\" might extract from you. Hang on to your no firmly. Ensure that the \"no\" is accompanied with a calm posture and even tone of voice. To build up your capacity to say no, practice stating no in easy situations to build confidence. In cases where an outright yes or no is not required, such as when there is partial agreement, state a qualified yes. Simply put, agree to the request but set clear boundaries as to what is acceptable and not acceptable to you. This is your right. For example, your boss requires that you stay overtime. You agree, but only until 9:00pm, so you state, \"Yes, I can take some extra work tonight. I'll stay until 9:00pm tonight.\" Situations which call for the expression of boundaries include instances when generosity is taken advantage of and welcome is overstayed.

Creating a new assertive personality takes longer. Through constant practice of assertive behavior, our personalities evolve and eventually become naturally assertive. Three weeks of constant behavioral modification through conscious replacement of weak and passive conduct with stronger ones make the change permanent. In this book, behavior modification entails incorporating certain new vocabulary, avoiding the use of certain sentences, adopting new habits and solving special problem situations in a specific manner. The practice of the following exercises firmly entrench assertive behavior consciously and subconsciously. Behavior Building Exercises For Increased Influence and Power Avoid the use of the word \"should\" and use \"will\" instead. Say, \"I will finish the project at 9:00.\" Avoid saying the weaker, \"I should finish the project by 9:00\" Constant use of the word, \"will\" develops decisiveness and subliminally diminishes dependency on fate and on the expectations of others. Using \"will\" empowers us to accept that we are the final judges of our action and are ultimately l Hot Wire! file:///D|/pdf/hot_wire!.htm (1 of 4) [12/28/2000 1:48:34 PM]"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" responsible for the results. Hence, we strive to live up to what we state will happen. Avoid the word, \"can't\" like the plague; firmly say you \"can.\" When asked if you can accomplish a task or responsibility, say you \"can.\" Say, \"I can do it.\" If you believe you really \"can't\", then say that you can do something else similar or something better. They key is to eliminate the \"can't\" from your vocabulary. Ultimately, you develop a \"you can\" attitude which lets you negate all opposition with ease. Others will perceive you to be unstoppable, competent and confident. Case study: Your boss inquires whether an additional marketing project will tax your already chaotic schedule. You know accepting the proposition will jeopardize the quality of your work. So you reply that you can handle the additional job once the critical segments of your current project has been accomplished. Your reply saves you the burden of additional load while making your boss perceive you to be controlled and eager for responsibility. l When asking questions, formulate your queries that do not elicit yes or no responses. Give questions that demand open ended questions or forces the other person to choose from a multiple choice of answers. We frequently hear the question, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Weak and almost rhetorical, this question demands a yes or no response. It could effectively be rephrased, \"What can I do for you?\" The latter emphasizes that you mean it. It also forces the listener to give a specific reply. Constant practice of this manner of questioning ingrains a no-nonsense, confident personality. l Forget that the word \"but\" exists; replace all occurrences with the word \"and.\" Frequently, we hear someone say, \"You did a good job, but....\", or \"My team accomplished the mission, but....\", or, \"We can do it for you, but....\" The sound of \"but\" rings ominously. It negates whatever good news came before it with bad news. By replacing the word \"but\" with \"and\", a sentence sounds more optimistic. Consider the following examples: \"You did a good job, and I feel there are ways you could do it more efficiently.\" \"My team accomplished the mission, and there remains some kinks that can be solved immediately.\" Notice that even though the second part of each statement is negative, the \"and\" makes the speaker sound more optimistic and in control. It also enables him to assert facts that he'd rather remain hidden. In the long run, speakers using \"and\" mature assertively. l Apply the 180 Degree Mindset. Perhaps one of the most powerful mental exercises, this way of thinking replaces fear with power. A lot of us approach a negotiation quaking and fretting.

These reactions occur naturally, spurred by thoughts of failure. We are preoccupied too much with thoughts of ourselves - we worry about what blunder we might make or whether we might succeed. We overcome this common malady by thinking 180 degrees. Instead of focusing a single thought on ourselves, focus completely on the person before you. Push out all anxiety of how we may behave or what might be the outcome of the engagement; instead, make a complete 180 degree shift in thinking. Flood your awareness upon the other person, trying to empathize with what he may be feeling and seeking to understand his or her position. Push out any thought that has you in it. The key is to lose total awareness of yourself. Lose this self-absorption - and you vanquish your fear. Apply the Tiger Mindset- A vigorous and dynamic thought form, the tiger mindset consists of having the inner confidence that you can never fail , regardless of all outside factors. This mental stance protects you against fears of failure. Simply believe that nothing can cause you failure. Nothing. l Pace your voice slowly and evenly. End all statements with a downward inflection. Fast voices tend to rise in pitch. High pitched voices betray anxiety and degrade the aura of command. We lose our credibility when we sound whiny and incapable of controlling our rate of speech. When attempting persuasion, speak 40% slower than normal, drop the tone by making the voice emanate from the stomach and end each statement with a downward inflection and pause. Furthermore, punctuate each comma with appropriate pauses. This tone of voice endows instant authority to the speaker. l Use gestures and speech in a controlled manner. Don't make extravagant and wasteful movements. Move with silent precision. Punctuate points with well placed gestures. l Defend your personal space at all costs. There surrounds an invisible territory that accompanies us wherever we go. The bigger this perceived territory, the more assertive we're perceived to be and the greater the respect we command. Make efforts to increase this hidden sphere of space. When seated on a desk, clear as much room around you. Use personal accessories, like briefcases and dining implements to stake as much desk space surrounding you. When standing, take as much room. Spread your feet shoulder width apart. Square you shoulders. Fill the area around you with sweeping gestures when necessary. l Eye Contact. The eyes wield much power.

The effects can be tremendous. Exercised frequently, eye contact imbues one with actual and perceived authority and generates a forceful character. A person's name is the best tool to cut short an unpleasant meeting. Suffering the company of an insufferable bore can drive anyone mad. How often have we sat through a meeting in which someone inconsiderate hogged the whole conversation and wherein the only word you can utter is an \"uhu\"? Cut short that conversation! First, grab his attention by calling his name. That will throw him off balance. In the subsequent silence, seize the initiative and summarize his points before he can continue. Discuss the points as though the conversation had ended. End with a friendly acknowledgement and indicate your desire to continue another time. Then exit.

Driving Force Rapport Verbal Persuasion Understanding The Human Driving Force Wielding Irresistible Control The Five Most Important Words in the Human Vocabulary In the human vocabulary there are five most important words. These words represent an ever-present disposition that dictate the way we behave the way we do. The words are: What's In It For Me? A government employee spends hours sorting files to get his daily wage. A philanthropist donates huge sums to charity in order to get that \"good-feeling.\" A missionary worker travels into jungles to achieve a divine sense of fulfillment. A chief executive duels with tremendous pressure to acquire a fortune. We do things because we have something to gain. Whatever this gain is, it is the reason we go through the trouble of stressful labor. The temptation of a reward spurs action. Understand now the prime importance of those five powerful words. If you can answer \"What Is In It For Him.\" every time you enter a dialogue, you can win over anyone. To win a debate or argument or to gain concessions you must make the other person see that he has something to gain from doing as you ask. Speak of what you want in terms of what your prospect wants.

The Top Ten Human Needs –Satisfy Them To Gain Compliance Human beings possess ten psychological needs. At specific times, some needs press more heavily than others. To persuade, first attempt to discern which general need preoccupies your prospect the most. Upon identifying the general need, discern the specific need spawned by the general need. When you discover the needs that press most strongly, word your request, proposal or idea in such a way that agreement to your proposal will satisfy his needs. This is the second golden key of persuasion. The general needs are: Affection: a desire to belong Excellence: the drive to win Esteem: a passion to be admired Security: a need for protection Greed: a want for more than the right amount Recognition: a need for personal worth Power: a desire for supremacy Privacy: an urge to protect personal space Ego: a sense of pride Liberty: a craving to control one's fate.

Esteem. Should you fail to identify a specific need, work on the need for esteem. Feed your prospect's feeling of importance. You can get anyone to do virtually anything if it makes him feel important. Arrange matters such that someone can achieve that feeling only by acceding to a request you give. The acronym PRiNCeS arms you with a toolbox to use whenever seeking to satisfy the Feeling of Importance. Feed this need for importance, and doors open to you. Praise . Praise someone sincerely to boost his esteem. When requiring better work quality from a subordinate, announce that he works in a unique and efficient manner and say that you expect better output from his unique process. Stand back and watch him prove you right. Remember that praise works best only when complimenting a characteristic or trait that is not obvious. When praised, the target of your praise basks in the compliment and does everything in his power to live up to the praise, and to acquire more praise. Subconsciously, he fears doing something that will retract the praise. For you, the persuader, the implication is that your prospect will fulfill your requests or accede to your ideas simply to be worthy of the praise. If someone constantly criticizes your manner of dress, kill further criticism by praising his good style and taste. This paradoxical behavior has a 75% chance of killing any further reproach from him How can he criticize you for something you laude him for? Reputation. Giving someone an alleged 'good' reputation to live up to is a powerful technique to gain concessions. A common example would involve a subordinate requesting for a raise. He may appeal to the boss's good nature by saying: \"I've always known you to be a fair man and that you reward the diligence of your employees. Today, I would like to request for a salary increase because of the sudden bills that piled up.\" By declaring the boss to have a reputation of fairness, the subordinate boosted his chances of getting what he wanted. The boss would find it hard to turn down a just request when he realizes that he holds the distinction of being a rewarding and fair employer. Need. We love to help when we feel needed. If we know that our personal actions contribute greatly to a cause or effort and are noticed by those we help, we are more than willing to give in to a request. When attempting persuasion, make your prospect feel that his help is very much desired; that his hand is vital to the success of our endeavors, that he contributes a great deal. Politicians understand this principle.

This 'personal touch' increases the morale of even the lowliest supporter to give his all for a victorious election. Being needed is a wonderful thing. Challenge. What's our reflex when someone doubts our ability to do something? Prove them otherwise! Throwing a Challenge is a manipulative tool whereby you politely voice doubt about someone's ability to accomplish a task. This doubt spurs zealous action to prove it false. To persuade a lagging supervisor to, say, whip his employees into shape, you might say: \"I'm not sure you have the capacity to get those bums of yours to increase production, so I'm thinking of getting a consultant to do the job instead.\" Watch the recipient of this reverse psychology get right down to work! To prove his capabilities, your unwitting supervisor will exhaust all resources on his own initiative. Superiority. If you need someone's staunch support or competent help, acknowledge their superiority. For the moment, assume that you are running a production deadline. Your men are behind schedule and you badly require assistance from a think tank in another department. Inter-department rivalry normally hinders such cooperation so you attack the matter smartly. You approach an able and quick thinking candidate who may just solve the bottlenecks and say, \"I've always admired your work; you're the best project manager this entire division has and no problem has ever stumped you. Right now, I need your expertise which I cannot get elsewhere. May I have a few hours of your time?\" Play on someone's pride this way, and you're bound to reap bountiful concessions. When someone is acknowledged as superior, he'll go all the way to prove it. As you read the previous paragraphs, and realize that man possesses certain innate psychological needs, you acquire mastery of the human driving force. Knowledge of how people think and act is important; more significant is knowing that people act to fulfill specific needs. This knowledge enables you to convince effectively. By knowing what others need and crave for, and by putting your position, or idea in a deftly worded request that compliments someone's needs, your chances for successful persuasion skyrockets. Remember this key always. Elicit the belief that your idea is to his or her benefit. Create this belief in his or her mind by feeding their feeling of importance: use praise, show that they are needed, acknowledge their superiority, give them a reputation to live up to, or give a challenge to prove their skills.

Physical attraction plays little role in this. What is important is the psychic bond that heightens from being on the same wavelength. When in rapport, ideas that are shared between two individuals are readily accepted by both parties. For this reason, intense rapport can be similar to a light trance. Rapport can be artificially generated prior to a \"persuasive encounter.\" To generate rapport similar to the situation illustrated two paragraphs ago requires a little knowledge of the human psyche. There are two psychological principles that have been studied and verified. These rules are: We like those who like us. l We like those similar to us and who validate us. l These principles (together with the rest of the unstated and voluminous supporting evidence) state that we like those who are similar to us. We gravitate to those who validate the way we think or feel, because they mirror us. Essentially we like them because they remind us of ourselves! Once \"liking\" comes in to the picture, persuading glides in very easily. The task of convincing someone who likes you takes virtually no effort. Furthermore, convincing someone who sees himself in your person makes the task an even simpler, delightful game! Rapport is the third golden key to persuasion. There are three separate methods of rapport generation. Each one attempts to increase someone's attraction to you. Combine all three in one attempt and persuasion becomes ninety-nine percent successful. Mirroring and Matching Neurolinguistic programmers, psychologists adept at persuasive techniques, discovered a magical tool. They uncovered the secret used by compliance professionals that guarantee almost unbeatable results. They discovered that by exactly mirroring the person you attempt to persuade, you can generate a very deep sense of rapport in that person. Rapport file:///D|/pdf/rapport.htm (2 of 10) [12/28/2000 1:48:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"To mirror someone is to do exactly as they do - 100%. This means that you mirror their posture, their gestures, their body language, their tone of voice, inflection and speaking rate, their disposition and even the way they breathe. Mirroring is simple. When he or she leans forward, you lean forward. When he gazes into your eyes, return with like intensity. When he crosses his arms, you fold yours. When he smiles, you smile. When he lifts the cup to drink, you do the same. Match the speed of his voice. Speak as fast or as slowly as he does; incorporate his words and phrases. Mirror the vocal inflections. Mirror the rhythm and speed of his movement. Breathe when he breathes by inhaling and exhaling as he does. Be as outgoing or as reserved as he is. Mirror his moods as well to intensify the rapture of the bond. If he feels down, validate his moods by mirroring it. Let him see his moods reflected from your person. For instance, say, \" I can see that you're disappointed and that everything went wrong. I feel bad for you.\" The worse thing to do when attempting to mirror someone is to invalidate and belittle the feelings of someone. Never say, \" Oh, you shouldn't worry about it! Things will look up soon!\" Such a disastrous statement breaks the rapport because you are effectively saying that he is wrong to feel that way. When mirroring, you should be \"validating\" everything he does-making a conscious effort to show that you are in agreement with him. Mirror his beliefs and opinions. Validate his notions. Take care on matters of contention. It is important to establish a strong similarity between the both of you. The importance of mirroring is this: When you mirror another person, you are in effect saying, “ We are alike. You are safe with me. You can trust me!” By mirroring, you build trust and establish credibility. It is an exceptionally reliable method that can bring compliance. It works magnificently because the mind is affected on the subconscious level. Once you have mirrored someone for about ten minutes, the magic begins: you can begin leading your prospect to compliance. Mirroring establishes a subtle bond that makes it easy for you to gain agreement. After that short period of mirroring, begin suggesting options for your prospect to follow. You will find that your prospect will attempt to continue the artificially generated rapport by giving in to your suggestions. The reason? The act of mirroring induced psychological feelings of pleasure. To maintain that pleasure entails maintaining the mirror. Thus, he now begins to mirror you by following your suggestions. Following your suggestions heightens the similarity between the both of you, which is the root cause of the pleasure and which is the sole objective of the mirroring effort. Rapport file:///D|/pdf/rapport.htm (3 of 10) [12/28/2000 1:48:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"At this sweet point you no longer need to persist to actively maintain the mirror; your prospect willfully undertakes that burden. But before attempting to lead or persuade the other person, find out first if you have successfully established rapport. Do this subtly at a nonverbal level by first synchronizing with some aspects of the other person’s body language like facial expression, posture, or speech rate. Mirror that person briefly. After awhile, change your posture and wait to see if the other person responds. Rapport has been generated if the person moves to a mirror position of your new posture. If you get this complementary and positive response, it indicates that rapport exists and that persuasion efforts are primed for execution. If, however, the other person resists your lead and indicates that rapport doesn’t exist yet, continue mirroring and test again for rapport. Once rapport is verified, proceed making suggestions in line with your objective. As you make these suggestions, persist testing for rapport. When rapport is broken, back track and seek for new opportunities to suggest after agreement has been reestablished. The concept may appear ludicrous and the practice seems strange. To you, it does, but to the person you persuade, it is the magic spell that lowers the drawbridge. This technique summons power by appealing to his subconscious. Consciously, he is not aware of your mirroring; unconsciously, he sees someone who reminds him of himself. A tip when mirroring: commence mirroring about three minutes after the conversation begins to avoid being too obvious. Because of the subtlety involved, the power is multiplied. As your prospect speaks with you, he grows more and more comfortable because he feels he is speaking with himself. Furthermore, by mimicking his each and every action, you subliminally broadcast to his psyche that you are not just another entity.... You are an extension of his personality. This instantaneously forges the bond of liking and trust and the bridge of rapport magically rises. Try it. It's easy. Mind Linking Rapport file:///D|/pdf/rapport.htm (4 of 10) [12/28/2000 1:48:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Another easy method to induce telepathic rapport exists. While not as simple as mirroring and matching, proficiency at this skill adds to the increasing arsenal of tools that enable you to be a successful persuader. Mirroring induces a subliminal bond because the mind is fooled into believing it sees an exact replica of itself in someone else. Mind linking works through similar principles, except that it concentrates on generating mental wavelengths that fuse the consciousness of both individuals. What it does is to erode all mental barriers such as distrust, suspicion, fear, disgust. The objective of mind linking is to subliminally convince someone else that you have nothing but the best intentions for him. This paves the way to persuasion because your prospect then believes you to be credible and trustworthy. How can this powerful technique be placed to bear? The first step is to relax your face and clear your mind of all thoughts of yourself and of anything you may intend to selfishly gain from the person you will persuade. Clearing the mind can be easily done by mentally repeating a mantra such as, \"beep...beep...beep...\" or \"dot...dot...dot.\" This step is important because any selfish thought wave can be subconsciously perceived by people who are intuitive or psychically enhanced. Most women are gifted with intuition and can sense guises. Quick witted and savvy businessmen can detect questionable or dubious individuals. A clear and mental blank gets around this hindrance. Establish the mind-link by creating an empathic bond. This link grows through thought waves. Generate these thought waves by first defocusing your eyes on the person. What this means is that, instead of staring at one specific body part, focus on the whole person, the whole body. Notice all parts of his body by extending the range of your awareness. Allow your unconscious to put in the parts that you are not consciously aware of. From there, allow your mind to build a life-size, three-dimensional image of the person before you and really be aware of the totality of his presence. See and feel his presence. This trick is easily accomplished by martial artists who are simultaneously mindful of every aspect of his opponent's body and position without looking at every part. Once this tangible image is created before you, step into that image. Step into that life-like, three dimensional picture and begin to get a sense of what they might be feeling. You must feel them and imagine what they might be experiencing. Unleash your senses and make it highly receptive. Sense what it must be like to be them, looking from their eyes, standing from their position. Feel their clothing against your skin, feel the wind brush against their hair. Intensify the link. Project yourself mentally into the other person, so that you begin to really see what they see, feel how they feel, etc. When the bond can be felt, imagine a golden cord of light flowing from your heart and connecting his. Feel the surging might of the cord.

By then, your body may start trembling from the wash of mental energy (known as prana to the Indians and pneuma to the Jews). This energy makes rapport intensify. At this point, consolidate the rapport session by projecting powerful thoughts that directly bind him to you. There is only one thought form that can nurture receptivity and erode barriers. This thought form is the \"selfless\" thought form. To generate it, fill yourself with an overpowering desire to help the other person. Look at him calmly and think out to him, \" I want you to do all the good I can\", or \" I want to help you.\" Quietly visualize to him the gains that he will realize from your thought command. These thought forms can penetrate any psyche because it is awash with positive energy. The mind easily absorbs anything that it perceives to redound to its benefit. By flooding mind with such thoughts, he gains an instant liking to you, the source of such telepathic thoughts. Amazingly, it is this last step that neutralizes the last mental defenses that he may have against you. The thought forms you generated are processed by his mind on a very subtle level. Upon reception, his mind lowers its defenses and allows you to enter. Once you sense that rapport, you know that he is open to persuasion. The final step to rapport generation is to picture him actively subscribing to your idea, to your command. Picture him carrying out your requests. Fill the picture with energy and life. See it real. See it living and moving. When it bursts with energy, think it out to him. Project it consciously for a maximum of four seconds into his mind. Longer than that and the thought will backfire because the mind will bore of the picture and reject it. Congratulations. Venture forth and be confident of success, for the living energy of rapport flows and cascades like waterfalls between you. Strategy Mirror To explain this method requires another brief psychology review. There are three kinds of persons: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Visual people process thoughts and ideas visually. You know that someone is visually oriented when he uses words like, \" Can you picture that?\", \"Do you see what I mean?\", \"Please focus on what I'm saying.\" Rapport file:///D|/pdf/rapport.htm (6 of 10) [12/28/2000 1:48:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Auditory people process thoughts through their hearing faculties. You can find a lot of people like these; discerning them is simple. Listen for statements like, \" That's clear as a bell\", \"Can you hear what I'm saying?\", \" How does that sound to you?\" Kinesthetics are \"feeling\" people who process through their gut feel. Listen for statements like, \" I can sense it!\", \" Do you feel that?\", \" I can grasp the idea\". Everyone thinks in a predominantly visual, auditory or kinesthetic manner. However, everyone does mix all methods at the same time, in varying degrees. To generate rapport using the Strategy Mirror, first understand that for every decision one makes, an internal \"thinking\" template is followed. Everyone processes thoughts in a certain pattern. For instance, he may first do it visually, then kinesthetically then auditory. He may mix it up in whatever combination. The key to mirroring under this method is to decipher your prospect's decision making process and then to mirror it back to him. The principle is essentially similar to the mirror and matching technique, except that you mirror thought forms and decision making processes instead of body language. To convince someone of your idea or thought, you first determine how a person arrives at a conclusion, action or decision. This is done by asking four carefully phrased questions geared to elicit this information. After you gain this information, you play back the decision making strategy he just revealed, this time inputting the ideas you are trying to \"sell\". At this point the concept may appear vague. An illustration will shed light on this powerful technique. For the example, assume you are selling a piece of real estate. You want to convince someone to buy , and for that purpose, you decide to generate rapport through the Strategy Mirror method. For the opening salvo, ask four questions along the following lines: Q1: Tell me, do you remember a time when you bought a piece of real estate and were truly satisfied? Listen for the response then follow up with the following three important questions. Q2: So, tell me what was the first thing that drew you to that piece of land? Was it something you saw? Something you heard? Something you felt? This question reveals the first decision making strategy your prospect employs when choosing real estate. It reveals whether he uses a visual, Rapport file:///D|/pdf/rapport.htm (7 of 10) [12/28/2000 1:48:36 PM]"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"auditory or kinesthetic method. For this case assume he answers that it was the green grass and sweeping roof that he saw. This statement reveals that his first strategy is visual. Q3: After that striking thing that you (saw, heard or felt), what was the very next thing that appealed to you? Something else that you may have seen? Heard? Felt from the house? This question reveals the 2nd strategy technique he uses when buying houses. For this case, assume that he replies that the sound of the rustling brook nearby attracted him next. This reveals that his second decision making step is auditory. Q4: After that, what was the next thing that attracted you? Was it something else that you saw? That you heard? That you felt? This question reveals the 3rd strategy technique he subconsciously employs when buying homes. For this case, assume that he responds that he loved the feeling of warmth inside the home. After the fourth question, you have deciphered the decision making process your prospect normally uses to purchase homes which eventually satisfy him. You discovered that he first processes information visually (the green grass and sweeping roof), then auditory (the rustling brook), then kinesthetically (the warmth of the home). For the previous example, you know his psychological process is V-A-K, or visual, auditory, kinesthetic. This information can now be used to elicit rapport. Play back the discovered strategy to your client when selling him a piece of real estate. Phrase your persuasive speech to sell your idea following the V-A-K sequence. Here's an example: \"Mr. Smith, I have a wonderful piece of property for you. It's a breathtaking (V) piece of land with a great sunset (V). At night, you can hear the rustle of trees (A) that gives you a warm cozy feeling (K).\" By replaying his decision making strategy, and this time, inputting your own content into the framework of his strategy, you persuade him to your idea. The impact is subtle yet effective because your ideas reach him in the pattern that he uses to reach favorable conclusions. A word of warning . The decision making strategy varies from instance to instance. Your prospect uses different sequences for different situations. Do not assume that the discovered strategy will be the same for other decision making problems. He may use a K-A-V approach for purchasing a car, and the V-K-A approach for buying clothes.

This technique can be applied to other situations other than acquisitions. For instance, you can discover how someone gets attracted to others of the opposite sex. For such a situation, you may modify your questions in the following manner: Q1: Can you remember a time you were totally attracted to someone? Q2: What was the very first thing that attracted you? Was it something that you saw? Did he say something that inspired you? Was it his touch? Something he felt? Q3: After that, as you realized that he was so attractive, what was the very next thing that you noticed of him? What it something you saw in him? Something you heard? You felt? Q4: This really interests me! So what else pulled you to this mystery man? Something he may have said? Did you see him move in a certain way? Did a fuzzy feeling seem to grow inside you?

This method, the simplest of all the persuasive techniques, consists of three steps. · Presuppose that what you want has already been agreed upon, and that the outcome is good. Word your pitch using the past tense. · Presuppose that your prospect has accepted the proposal. · Presuppose that your prospect enjoyed the proposal. An example can elaborate this technique. Assume that you want to ask someone out. To word your elevator speech using the three steps might go along the following lines: \"Won't it be great after we've had dinner at the Ritz? The dining would be superb, with the glimmer of candles, sparkling wine and soothing music. After dinner, you'd smile to yourself and think that this must be the highlight of your week. See! You're already thinking about how much fun we'll have. The more you try to think of reasons why you can't accept my offer, the more you realize how much you'd love to come.\" This method energizes a powerful picture in your prospect's mind. Putting it in the past tense and in such glowing images make it hard to resist. By further presupposing that your prospect already accepted and enjoyed the idea makes the persuasive technique unbeatable. An ideal situation to apply this would be in business proposals. Businessmen enjoy dynamic, moving images painted in their minds. The Principle of Reciprocity Being human, we feel the need to repay favors given to us. It's our nature. A favor can trigger a feeling of indebtedness, and in effect, we develop a great need to relieve ourselves of the psychological burden of debt. To unload this burden, we become more than willing to return a favor almost larger than the one given us. The Principle of Reciprocity states that if someone grants us favors, invited or uninvited, an overpowering need to repay that favor immediately blooms within the recipient of that favor. This human trait transcends all cultures and races. Consider the following example: A child you don't know walks up and hands you a flower. It would be considered impolite to reject such a Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (2 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"thoughtful action, so you take it. Shortly after, the child asks if you would like to buy a cookie for her girl scout class. Because you just received a \"favor\" from the child, saying no to her request would have been tough because it would go against natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation arrangements. You buy a boxful of cookies. Notice how when someone smiles, you smile in return, or when someone compliments a personal characteristic, you return in kind? This is the power of reciprocation. A favor granted must be repaid. How often have we received small gifts through the mail: small keys, greeting cards, personalized address labels.... usually attached with a note requesting for funds to a popular charity? Big organizations have discovered that by giving a small favor or gift, the recipient of the gift develops a more pressing need to repay the favor. Repaying the favor entails complying with the request. The rule of the principle is simple: Give a favor, expect a return-favor. Business meetings tend to produce more favorable results if the project proponent treats the client to lunch. The lunch is a favor extended, and what is implicitly requested in return is a favorable contract. To use this Principle, one simply extends a small favor or gives a small gift prior a negotiation. Gifts are usually accepted since cultural norms dictate that recipients accept out of courtesy. Once accepted, the psychological need to repay the debt germinates. This raises the chances of later gaining what will be asked. The ethical overtones of using this principle, must be taken into proper perspective, however. Favors can constitute anything given \"out of good will\": § Little material trinkets. § Compliments § Food § Promises § Smiles § Drinks § Physical labor § Concessions Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (3 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Door-In-The-Face Method Another way to use the Principle of Reciprocity is by deploying the Door-In-The-Face technique. More devastating than the straightforward approach of giving a gift and receiving a return favor, this technique takes a subtle approach. Supposing you want to make a request \"B.\" One way to increase your chances of receiving compliance to that request \"B\" is to first make a much larger request \"A.\" Request \"A\" is similar to request \"B\", except that because of its magnitude, compliance to it is almost impossible. This much larger request is expected to be rejected. After the rejection, you immediately retreat to your originally planned request \"B\". Statistically, the request \"B\" has an almost 95% chance of receiving compliance because of this linguistic framework. This so effective because social norms dictate that a concession must be exchanged with a concession. By allowing your request \"A\" to be rejected, you gave a concession. Therefore the person you persuade must respond with a concession.... that of complying with your allegedly smaller request \"B\"! Why does it work so well? Cultural norms tend to override even logic and inner resistance. The Door-In-The-Face Method takes two steps: First Step : Make a large request (this elicits a No!) Second Step : Make the real, and smaller request: (this gets the Yes!) Labor negotiators frequently deploy this tool. They begin with extreme demands expected to be turned down. Abruptly, they repeat to a series of smaller demands, or concessions which will then be more easily accepted. These smaller demands are the real target of the labor group. The larger requests were merely decoys meant to provide smokescreens. Children use this technique very well. Sometimes, a child may desire a small item like a cassette. To increase his chance of getting it, he makes huge requests, like a CD player or arcade game. The parents expectedly turn it down. What does the child do then? He retreats to his real request and says that if he can't get a CD, can he get a cassette tape instead? The response to such a comparatively trifling request is evident. The Principle of Commitment and Consistency Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (4 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"We all fool ourselves from time to time to keep our thoughts and beliefs consistent with what we have already done and decided. When we publicly take a stand on something, our subsequent actions must be in harmony with what we have previously made manifest. This quirk in human behavior is described by the Commitment and Consistency Principle. We commit to something that we willingly make known and then, we remain consistent in behavior to it. Inconsistent behavior produces psychological tension that must be avoided at all costs. The Foot in the Door technique applies this principle. The Foot-In-The-Door Technique To use this technique, you must first decide on an outcome you want (this is your major request). Upon deciding your outcome, you create a series of small, related requests that are easy to say yes to. After stating these two or three requests, you pop the big question. Because of the first \"yes's\" that were easily solicited, your prospect is mentally conditioned to say yes to the primary and real request. The small requests are created to elicit \"commitment\" to a certain related idea or request to be given in the end. This technique works by conditioning the mind to be consistent with the previous stance of saying yes repeatedly. It's that simple. The series of small requests create commitments to a certain action. The final request requires an action of similar nature, and thus, to be consistent, compliance with the final request is necessary. First get someone to commit (say yes!) to a series of thoughts, ideas or actions. Your prospect will then automatically comply with any final thought, idea or action that is related, just to be consistent. The technique is simple: 1st Step : Make a very small request (Get an easy yes response and first commitment!) 2nd Step : Make another very small request (Get another easy yes response and the second commitment!) 3rd Step : Make your real request, a bigger one. (Get a yes response!) The important step is to ensure that all the requests are related in nature. If the last request is environmentally themed, so should the previous two requests. This allows the Principle to be mustered effectively. Sometimes, prior to making the request, it is good to give an \"enticing Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (5 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"motivator\" to set the stage. Car salesmen have been guilty of using this technique to sell cars. What they do is to advertise a car at a magnificently low price (the \"enticing motivator\") A buyer comes, drawn by the price. The salesmen and the buyer start discussing terms of payment, signing documents and filling forms. These acts of discussion and writing constitute the various \"small commitments\" leading to the act of closing the deal (the major request of the salesman). By discussing and writing for at least an hour before the end of the sale, the buyer is subconsciously committing to consummate the transaction. Before the consummation, the salesman disappears and comes back with news that there was an error in calculation. He reveals that the car had a price tag a few hundred dollars more. Despite the sudden price increase, and because of the various little commitments made, the buyer has no choice but to push forward with the deal. Pacing and Leading Method of Persuasion The Rhythm To Success The method of Pacing and Leading derives its power from the Principle of Consistency. Similar to the Foot-In-The-Door Technique, it follows a rhythmical pattern of pace and lead statements designed to create almost irrational beliefs in a proposed idea. Like the previous technique, the theory involves eliciting enough 'yes' during the course of the conversation so your prospect will automatically agree when you make the primary request/s. Verbal pacing and leading sets up an unconscious yes-set which contribute to its effectiveness. By making a series of statements or questions that elicit a yes, you condition your prospect's mind to continue saying yes even up to the point of your real request or idea. It works even if the request is hard, or the idea is abhorrent. The Pace-Lead Method associates things that are obviously and irrefutably true with what you'd like people to believe as true. When you use this technique you first create Pace Statements. These statements are statements or questions that can immediately be proven as true or are commonly accepted as true. You also create Lead Statements. Leads are statements or requests that you want your prospect to comply with. Lead statements talk about things you want your prospect to believe in and that hasn't been commonly accepted as true. Once you arrive at the appropriate pace and lead statements, you link the Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (6 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"pace statements to the lead statements in the following manner to generate belief and compliance: Pace, Pace, Pace, Lead Pace, Pace, Lead, Lead Pace, Lead, Lead, Lead Lead, Lead, Lead, Lead By mixing the Pace statements with the Lead statements in this manner, you blur the distinction between what is obviously true and what is not really so true.

By the time we come to the leads, it's easier to say yes without noticing that the leads are no longer undeniably true. Remember that you should not sound stilted or artificial. When speaking in this manner, make the conversation as spontaneous as can be. Ask for short responses from your prospect for your pace statements. Select pace statements that he or she is almost guaranteed to believe in. Here's a final example. This time the pace statements utilize facts that are observable sensually (visual, auditory, kinesthetic). Hence they create a powerful influencing effect.

The Principle of Attribution Giving Explanations to Invoke Sustained Behavior People frequently do something because they believe in a certain truth about themselves. An internal attribution about who they are causes certain types of behavior. If someone makes an internal attribution (\"I will sign this petition because I am this kind of person\") then he will most likely perform a future, related action because, \"I am still that kind of person.\" A person who believes himself to be neat will pick up trash today, tomorrow and next month. Additionally, he will do all kinds of orderly things. He does this to be consistent with the internal attribution he creates for himself. The Principle of Attribution allows us to modify people's behavior by merely giving an attribution. If you want someone to do something, not just now, but always, proclaim to him a certain \"perceived\" attribution. He will come to see himself as that type of person and behave Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (8 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"accordingly. To create an attribution, apply it in a situation where people are thinking about why things are happening. Second, give an explanation that is an internal attribution for the desired behavior. State that things are happening because \"that person is like that.\" The Explanation you give is the attribution that will enforce the desired behavior from that moment on. For instance, a teacher hopes to increase the grades of her students. After a successful quiz, she makes an attribution, saying, \"My! These quizzes have been well answered! I wonder... I think you've all been studying very hard and you've gotten brighter!\" With this simple sentence, the teacher attributes the quiz scores to initiative and studying hard. The students realize this might be so, and regardless of whether they studied before or not, they do start studying to be consistent with the attribution. They think, \"I got a good grade coz I study hard. Therefore, I must study hard for the next quiz.\" A boss can also elicit greater productivity from his workers. He might say to an employee, \"Mark, you've been at this desk for hours and I can see results. You must be a hardworking person with your sights on your goal! Keep up the good work.\" The boss attributes the good business results to hard work and prioritizing. Mark will subconsciously make the internal attribution that he is indeed hardworking and act consistently with this belief. A simple declaration yields a field of surprises. The Charmer Method This last technique, unlike the previous methods, does not rely on sleight of tongue or verbal acrobatics. It works because you openly offer concessions, manifest a willingness to listen, and validate your prospect's beliefs. Your prospect has a free choice to decide. You do not cloud his mind with verbal mists. Of all the techniques discussed, it is the most ethical. Additionally, it takes the longest to carry out, but it can produce lasting relationships. Like the previous systems, this method is also devastatingly effective. Mastery of this method can lead to satisfying friendships as well as giving you what you want. The Charmer can be applied in four steps. Step 1. Create the Initial Benefit Statement. The Initial Benefit Statement, or IBS consists of two parts. Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (9 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"First, you state an Opener which consists of a current need, problem or desire that your prospect would like to satisfy. Second, you close with a Benefit Statement that includes specific idea or solution (your request) that answers that need. Stating the IBS is done using the pace-lead rhythm previously discussed in order to maximize its effectiveness. The IBS acts to whet the appetite of your prospect to listen and pay heed. When you formulate your IBS, you can use the following examples: Openers: \"It is my understanding that you....\" \"We've found that most people are looking for...\" \"I hear you have a problem in the area of...\" \"What most people want...\" \"What if I could show you a way...\" \"It's hard to be unproductive because....\" Benefit Statement: \"This is why many normally do this....\" \"X works specially well in this scenario...\" \"In such situations, x is the best possible solution...\" \"In other words, what you're looking for is....\" When making the initial benefit statement, be certain to point out that your idea does solve his problem. If you can accomplish this, you have enticed your prospect. This would be a sample IBS using the Pace-Lead Rhythm. \"Mr. Richards, times have been bad and money doesn't flow so well anymore, specially for small firms such as yours. We know that your operations are no longer very efficient and it cuts back on your profits. We can provide you with the necessary computerized networking solution that can cut wastes 90% and boost profits 70%. How does that sound to you? The IBS certainly grabbed his attention, didn't it? He saw that he had Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (10 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"something to gain. Step 2. Ask questions to elicit information on his needs which you seek to address . No matter how well worded your IBS, your prospect holds many pressing needs begging to be filled. By careful questioning, you can get people to reveal their hidden needs and reconsider their position in light of what you have to offer. It is important that you choose your questions well. Raise questions that will lead to revealing hidden needs which your idea, proposal or product can directly address. Raise questions that will direct you to proclaiming more of the benefits of your idea. Step 3. Agree Agree Agree. Whenever the other person responds in such a way that offers you an opening to reinforce your proposal's benefits, agree with his remarks, and develop his thought with the benefits that logically flows from his statement. Ensure that your benefits include feeling benefits, such as feelings of security, comfort, pride...etc. Benefits such as these persuade very strongly. To illustrate Step 2 and Step 3, assume that you are selling brand new computers, so you ask a question that will lead to a specific benefit you offer. You : \"So Mr. Richards, I can see that you distrust computerization. Why is this the case?\" Richards : \"I've tried it before and it was a nightmare. Something always broke down! Whenever we called technical support, they placed us on hold. We ended up with a white elephant.\" You : \"I agree with you. Computers do break down and most companies fail to respond to their customers. It's a big problem in the industry. We can guarantee you against this problem because we have over 350 technical staff on our roster working night and day. You'll never have a problem again. The agreement with your prospect's statements clarify in his mind that you are considering his concerns very carefully. This heightens his receptivity to your proposals. Each time you agree with his concerns, and raise a benefit to absorb his anxiety, you edge a step closer to successful persuasion. Step 4 Ask for what you want. Finally, when you sense a good deal of rapport and agreement to your Verbal Persuasion file:///D|/pdf/verbal_persuasion.htm (11 of 12) [12/28/2000 1:48:37 PM]"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"proposal, make the request. Close the deal. A positive mind set helps. Make the assumption that the deal has been accepted prior to asking. Behave in a confident manner. First, summarize the benefits you offered. Second, state the confident request using the following formula: \"Based on what you've told me... I'm going to suggest that the best course of action for us is....\" Or \"I can see you've reached your decision... I guess what we should do now is.....\" Take heed of the italicized words. Emphasize that the decision flows logically from his facts. Emphasize also the us/we involvement. The prospect will feel more at ease knowing that both you and he embark on that decision together. From there, you can cap it all up with this standard close: “We guarantee that you'll love the results. It's so easy. It's really works, its your best option not just now, but in the future.” [ Home ] [ Up ] Send mail to Joseph R Plazo with questions or comments about this book.

Beating Other Masters of Persuasion Overcoming Impossible Prospects Certain stubborn or skilled individuals make it hard for even the most persuasive speaker. At some point, you will encounter another master of persuasion. The following assorted verbal tools can overcome staunch resistance to your charms. Feel Felt Found Technique When an objection is raised, you can quell further escalation by letting your prospect see that others have traveled that path and saw that your way was truly the best way. Before you answer an objection, you can minimize tension by saying: \"I understand how you feel. My previous clients felt the same way, and when they first began to realize that they should get involved as I am proposing, they found that the decision was sound after all! When you get right down to it, I'm your ally. We're in this together.\" This type of speech can dispel negative vibes very easily since you empathize with the anxieties of your prospect. Isolate Objections Technique Out of the ten or twenty objections aimed your way. One or two are true. Keep Winning! file:///D|/pdf/keep_winning!.htm (1 of 4) [12/28/2000 2:03:00 PM]"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The rest are false. If you can discern the core objection, and rebut it masterfully you can persuade effectively even if the rest of the objections remain unanswered. When you hear an objection, you may reply: \"You raised an important question. Is this your primary concern?\" (listen to the response, then say:) \"If that is your only concern, I'm going to suggest that you realize the fact that .... (overcome the objection.) Yes - No Transformations Sometimes, you sense your prospect visibly agitated, itching to say NO right in your face. Getting rid of that negative tension must be attended to prior to continuing the persuasion process. Surprisingly, you can get your prospect to say NO out loud and still leave the door open to further negotiation. This technique allows your subject to relax by saying NO out loud: \"Do you have any objection:  ... discussing this further?  .... A fair analysis of the pros and cons?\" \"Do you mind if...  ...I ask you a favor?  ...we continue this discussion?\" The Reverse Psychology Sometimes you have to force your prospect to admit that they are ultimately responsible for making the crucial decision to proceed with a proposal, and that you will not wait for them any longer to continue delaying. This is reverse psychology. Reverse Psychology makes your prospects feel that should they fail to agree with your idea, they are making a major mistake and that they lack the cleverness to see the benefits of your offer. With this tactic, you create a powerful guilt trip which leads your prospect to falling into your hands like putty.

Seduction The Principles of Romance For many of us, the world is filled with strangers. Romance is an elusive dream that flits away the harder we try. A loveless destiny. Condemned to such a fate, can one bear to live on? Men are social beings. Food, water, and shelter are vital to survival. These alone cannot bring happiness, though -- not even owning a private yacht nor the entire Bank of England. Men and women thrive on love. Each one has a deep psychological need to be cared for. Love is a potent force. Poets immortalized its power in ballade, song, parchment and story. Love launched ships, caused the division of clans and brought ruin to nations. The power of love cannot be underestimated. Man breathes love as surely as he breathes oxygen. Love gives life. To be loved is to be cared for in a special way that is uniquely different from the next person. Loving is caring and satisfying deep emotional needs. Show this care with special words and actions that fill these needs, and that special person you care for will start caring back. This is the principle of romance. Give and you receive. Romance Theory holds three tenets, based soundly upon psychological principles. Seduction! file:///D|/pdf/seduction.htm (1 of 7) [12/28/2000 2:03:34 PM]"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":" Romance Theory - · We like people who like us first. We tend to get attracted to someone who displays attraction to us. Also, we prefer that people like us first before we like them. The best way to get the ball rolling is to start manifesting attraction instead of hiding it. · Romance begins with someone initiating contact; once someone has taken the initiative, there will exist a natural urge in the other person to respond positively. This principle declares that a relationship begins only with someone taking the first step. No--it doesn't have to be the man to do so. Women can initiate by engaging the man in lighthearted conversation. · An upbeat personality allures. We love happy people. We bask in their presence. One can be more attractive by acting happy. The quickest way to add ten more points to your allure quotient is by smiling and radiating bliss. Negative opinions, and beak outlooks should be minimized at the start of a romantic escapade. Conversation should include positive and optimistic material. The first contact is not yet the time to discuss debts, a pending murder trial or a recent AIDS infection. Winning the Love Game The previous principles underlie the up-coming techniques that make falling in love and attracting others a painless and delightful game. It is a timeless game that reaps happiness for the victorious. Flirting, attracting and mesmerizing -- this is the game of seduction. Those unskilled at this art behave boorishly, often repelling instead of attracting. Seduction, despite it's contaminated connotation, is pure. It is an innocent act whereby one identifies the secret needs of the other and satisfies these needs. Flirtation is just the beginning phase of seduction. During this phase, the man or the woman makes obvious his or her attraction. Once successful, the true seduction occurs. Seduction occurs at an emotional, physical and spiritual level. That is why seduction ends with two people falling in love. Seduction! file:///D|/pdf/seduction.htm (2 of 7) [12/28/2000 2:03:34 PM]"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Romance theory must now give way to technique. Use these techniques and reap the bounty of romance. The Techniques of Seduction. Make the First Move. People can die waiting. It doesn't pay to hunker by the sidelines. Keep waiting, and not just life, but love will pass you by. Patience is a virtue, but it doesn't help to keep waiting till old age. The right man or woman may never approach you. They may also be waiting to be approached! Remember that to get a reaction, you must act first. Seize the initiative and you will get a positive response. Romeo, Don Juan and James Bond never waited to be approached. They made the first move. Someone has to make the first move. It might as well be you. Energize yourself with optimistic thoughts. Relax. Adrenalin tends to rush in these instances. Adrenalin is necessary to outrace rabid dogs, but it can mess up your chances of charming the object of your desire. Notice how clammy your hands get, how your pulse quickens? Breathe deeply for 15 seconds as slowly as you can. This will lower your heart rate. Apply the 180 degree think method mentioned earlier in this book. When your systems normalize, make the approach. Don't use any of the passé, corny pick-up lines. They are degrading. The best opening gambit would be: \"Hi! I can't help but notice you. My name is ___________. May I have the pleasure of your company?\" Believe it or not, this line works better than all the rest. Simple, and direct, it communicates sincerity. If you can, spice it with a dash of humor. To buttress your chances of getting even more noticed, following up with a compliment or a question can help. Observe her carefully and decide upon a not-so-obvious character trait or accessory that you can compliment on. Make your compliment sincere. False flattery always fails. Study the body language of your prospect. Should it be closed, mirror that closed posture, then slowly open up yours. Subconsciously, she will follow suit, and when she does, so will her frame of mind. It's a sly move used by specially trained individuals to promote receptivity.

Let your eyes sparkle. Smile. Grin broadly. Happiness is contagious. Be glad to be around that person. Let your intonation drip with mirth. Two happy people can discover miracles in each other. Happy people create relationships. When we choose a partner, we look for someone we foresee will make us happy. You have a greater chance wooing that girl with a grin, rather than a grimace. Appear enthusiastic, as well as happy. Show that you have a passion for life. Manifest your zest. Discuss each thing as though it meant much to you. Make an effort to recognize that there are dark and bright sides to life, but you will be willing to dwell only about the lighter side of things. Be upbeat and win her heart! Let her talk. You do the listening. Men talk too much. They brag about their achievements, their objectives, the many girls they slept with. Discussing these in detail, and at length will not only bore, it will repel even the most patient girl. Seduction is a form of yielding and giving. Give in to the other person. Satisfy her ego. Satisfy her needs to tell her own stories, to narrate her triumphs. A great seduction technique is to encourage the object of your affection to keep talking. Formulate open-ended questions and listen in rapture to her responses. Lean forward as you listen. Gaze into her eyes with interest. Pretend that no one else is in the room -- not even if a dazzling blonde sits next to you. Never interrupt as you listen. Pause for two seconds at the end of her statements then gently prod with more open ended questions. Your respectful silence will let her feel more understood, more loved. As you listen, overwhelm her with positive body language. Lean forward slightly, uncross your arms and legs. Nod frequently. Maintain non-aggressive eye contact. When she requests feedback, simply paraphrase her statements. Echo your understanding of what she said. Don't go off-topic. You will kill the developing rapport. Be patient. Listen expectantly. Don't rush her. Accept what is being said without approval or criticism. The time for that will come later. At this early stage, you must show how well you listen! Listening works miracles because you satisfy deep psychological needs. Listening can be the most potent aphrodisiac. Women (men, all the more) crave to share about themselves.

About sixty percent of conversational statements have the word \"I\" in it; this signifies just how important the ego is to each human being. When women talk, they love to talk about themselves and seek validation and agreement from their listeners. By listening silently and attentively, you validate what is being said. Listen intently and you broadcast a hidden message: I love what I'm hearing; go on!! Listen with all your heart. It is the highest praise. Without uttering a single word, the simple act of listening can win you intense admiration -- and her heart! Emphasize similarity. Listening is important. When you listen with your entire being, you render the supreme worship. The act of listening demonstrates profound respect and sensitivity. Listening wins half the battle in the quest for romance. However, listening alone is not enough. You must prove that both of you are alike. Remember one of the basic rules of psychology: we like those who are like ourselves. Assume that you've listened all night, paraphrased her statements and prodded with information seeking questions. Your date will marvel at how thoughtful you were. You've satisfied her ego and bolstered her self esteem. When she gets home, she'll bask in the afterglow of that wonderful conversation. She'll think that she's had a great time sharing about herself. Then, she'll think about you. Try as she might, her recollection of you will be vague. Why? Because you haven't mentioned a word about yourself. She will just remember how well you've listened. Being a good listener won't encourage her to see you again. Once the memory of how well you've listened fades, she may move on, seeking men who possess wonderful qualities other than listening. Listening is therefore just part of the formula to complete seduction. To attract her totally, you must convince her that you are worthy of her love. The best way to carry out this urgent mission is to show her that you are just like the person she loves most: herself! People love those who are like themselves.

Paying attention to details that she reveal becomes critical at this point. Mentally tag down her hot buttons -- subjects she loves discussing and express your enthusiasm for them. Emphasizing similarities guarantee that the relationship will continue beyond this first encounter. This act cements friendship not only between members of the opposite sex, but between same sex acquaintances as well. Stand your ground. Claim your independence. Make it clear that you have goals. You will strive for your aspiration, despite the outcome of your relationship. Independent men and women are very attractive. Exhibit decisiveness. Move with purpose and vigor. Allow a little flexibility, but show that you will not compromise your inner principles. Principled men and women are sexy. Exhibit that you are opinionated. Make it clear that you sit no fences. Should you disagree on a topic hang on to your point while making it clear that her views are as valid as yours. Disagree agreeably. Accept that many sides surround an argument. Listen to her points then thank her for presenting a side that enlightened and complimented your understanding! Praise. Don't flatter. Do praise. Seek obscure aspects about your date that you may praise. It may be her manner of walking, her bag or that little tattoo on the shoulder. Praise should be moderated. Too much and you risk dampening its effects. Too little, and you might be perceived. as hard to please. Whet her appetite with just enough praise. Sprinkle it when she least expects it.

But in its present condition, I'd say it's Intercontinental Style.\" Let her interpret it as praise or criticism! Of course you could always be safe and say, \"No Comment!\" In summary: Life and love bring so much anxiety! To succeed in a job, at academics, in love or at whatever endeavor requires initiative. You can't harvest the farm till after you've sowed, watered and fertilized. In the garden of love, you take the first steps. You initiate contact. Rejection is still a possibility. That's the catch. But nothing in life is without risk. Taking the first step gives you 99% chance of success. Sitting and waiting gives you a .05% probability of getting a lifetime partner.

Advanced Techniques to Induce Liking and Attraction Establishing Contact, Building Friendship and Creating Intimacy About 75% of the world's population quivers at the prospect of striking up conversations with a stranger. The reason? Shyness. Shyness can be attributed to cultural factors. Being raised in conservative environments or living in harsh communes makes people timid. Having critical friends and domineering colleagues can further aggravate shyness. Shyness can also be genetic. There's a joke that goes: The gene for shyness has been discovered. Scientists at MIT discovered it hiding behind a set of other genes. Nevertheless, shyness poses a problem for those who want to persuade. This malady prevents persuasion by aborting communication. Fortunately, techniques to combat shyness do exist. With constant practice, anyone can learn to \"break the ice\", establish rapport, and make new friends. Once you have won trust, you can persuade much more easily. Notice how salesmen always attempt friendship before selling. The Principle of Liking states that we are more easily persuaded by those whom we like. This chapter concentrates on teaching the essentials of striking up a conversation with perfect strangers, then making a friend out of them. It provides formulas necessary to minimize, then eliminate entirely, shyness.

Paint a New Self-Image on your Canvass Your first problem: discarding that negative image of yourself. Many men and women are critical of themselves. They feel that they are \"ugly\", \"dull\", \"boring\". These devastating thought forms hinder communication! How can you convince others otherwise if this was your mindset? Paint a much better image of yourself! Whatever you may feel inside, it is important to project a positive and charming image. Your projected image is the sum total of the appearance and personality by which you are judged by others. Your projected image depends on the way you stand, speak, dress, smile, walk, make eye contact.... You package yourself to others this way; and the more beautiful the package, the more readily accepted it is. The first step to packaging yourself properly comes from your beliefs. Picture yourself as you want to be and project it forcefully. Believe that you have charm, wit and confidence. Believe that you are attractive, commanding and likeable. Day by day, your inner mental picture will take shape and manifest itself externally. You will become who you picture yourself to be. Eventually no effort will be necessary to maintain this image. Here are some techniques to bolster your image building efforts. Use smiles like a magic wand to gain trust. Greet people in a friendly way regardless of their attitude towards you. Remember the principle of reciprocity? Smile at others and chances are, they'll smile back. Frown, and people will snarl back. Take the initiative: smile and be pleasant. In return, you'll receive wonderful reactions: smiles, laughter, a handshake and perhaps a new friend. Life is a chain of action and reaction. Begin everything with positive action! l Be presentable. Appear kept, neat and tasteful. You can wear simple clothes, but carry yourself with dignity. Stand straight, indulge in eye contact. Move with confidence and a sense of purpose. Act as though you know where you're going and that you have plans in life. To attract other winners, you must look like a winner. l Be enthusiastic. Brim with life. Look alive and be alive.

The effort pays off in spades. Once you've acquired that new image don't fall back to old habits of fading into the background and being a negative sourpuss. You've earned that million dollar image.

These unfortunate people adopt non-receptive body language (discussed earlier in the book) and stifle conversation before it even commences. To make non-verbal communication work for you, you can use a \"softening\" technique. The softening technique makes your initial impression work for you. The softening technique consists of a set of handy body language gestures that will make people more receptive to your attempts at contact. Initiating conversations become easier. S O F T E N A genius came up with this mnemonic (not me). Sometimes, remembering the entire body language alphabet can be overwhelming. This mnemonic lets you remember the most vital gestures that allow receptivity and openness. Deployed before any conversation, these body language gestures create the proper ambiance for friendship. S - Smile. Smile at someone . Do it sincerely. A positive non-verbal signal, this gesture communicates a willingness to communicate. The other person will consider it a compliment, allowing him to feel good. He will most likely smile back. When you send friendly messages, you get friendly messages back. Couple this smile with a warm hello. It indicates approval of the other person. Remember the basic theory on psychology 101? People like those who like them. Here's a little exercise. Smile at the mirror. After you smile, give your best grimace. With whom with you rather talk with? O - Open posture . Poor conversationalists frequently give off \"stay away\" signals by crossing their legs and arms. Because closed postures indicate a defensive frame of mind, these people appear unapproachable. Open that posture! Keep your arms and legs uncrossed. Don't cover your mouth or your chin with your hands. Appear at ease. Open postures send signals of receptivity and it beckons, \" I'm open for contact --- let's talk!\" F - Forward Lean . Learn forward in a natural and casual way when your prospect speaks. It indicates interest in your part and encourages him to continue talking. By appearing interested in what he may have to say, you Attraction Secrets file:///D|/pdf/attraction.htm (4 of 9) [12/28/2000 2:04:09 PM]"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"win the confidence and liking of your companion. You broadcast to him, \"Keep talking-- this is good stuff!\" Never lean back or put your hands behind your head. Don't mount your head on your chin (the famous \"thinking pose\"). You will appear disinterested. T - Touch . At some point early in the conversation, initiate a hand shake. This is a wonderful step to opening channels for communication. Energize the handshake; grip warmly, yet firmly. Touching breaks down the distance barrier between two individuals. E - Eye Contact . Direct eye contact further indicates interest in the other person. By gazing into someone's eyes you manifest willingness to talk and to know him better. Eye contact should be friendly, and non-aggressive. Allow your eyes to travel from his pupils, to his forehead, to his nose, then to his ears. Varying where you look makes your gaze softer and less forced. You can then concentrate on gazing upon the spot between his eyes for the rest of the conversation. For those still shy of eye gazing, maintain your gaze directly between the eyes. It gives the appearance of eye contact despite looking elsewhere. Eye contact is vital. It encourages your companion and he gazes back just as earnestly. If you minimize eye contact, you appear bored, or worse, dishonest. Little or no eye contact spells doom for communication. N - Nod . Nod when your companion speaks. Nodding shows that you listen. As with the previous gestures, nodding lets you appear friendly and open. Your companion will feel eager to go on talking because he senses your approval. The SOFTEN technique makes a good preparation for communication. The next step is to circulate, looking for receptive-looking individuals. Once you find someone open for contact, be the first to initiate conversation and apply the following techniques for the Conversation Phase. The Conversation Phase Here's where verbal communication comes in. The scientific procedure of conversation consists of the following steps: Be the first to say hello. l It is tough to make the first move. Unfortunately, if you wait for others to make the first move, chances are, you'll be waiting till the cows home. Take the risk and be the first to test the waters. Approach a friendly prospect. Establish eye contact. Smile, then introduce yourself warmly.

You give the impression that you are friendly, outgoing and open. By initiating, you also flatter the other person by signifying interest. Once you get the hang of it, play this game wherever you go. Approach people in the bank while waiting in line. Chatter with the receptionist at the hotel. You'll make friends in high and low places. Contacts are invaluable. This first step entails taking an active stance. Once you diminish passive behaviour towards meeting new people, not only will your number of friends increase, so will your confidence and ego. Deploy ritual questions to melt the ice. l Once you've squeezed out that hello, you can begin the conversation in two effective ways: 1) Give a compliment. Find and mention something praiseworthy of your prospect. You might say, \"That is a striking Bugs Bunny tie you're wearing! Did your wife give that to you?\" After the compliment, give a follow up question directly related to the compliment. This ensures that your conversation continues. Another way of complimenting is mentioning something your prospect is carrying. Mention how unusual it is and follow up with more questions. 2) Comment or make a question based on the situation . A good place for such an opening gambit would be in a restaurant. Upon entry, seek for a solitary diner. Approach him and mention, \"I'm trying out a new restaurant this week because the old one was closed by the health inspectors. They found a rat in the stew. Could you recommend something here?\" Focus on the situation that you are in. Identify yourself in your immediate environment. Take note of the place you're traveling, the people around you, and the events going on. What is happening. Why are you here? There are hundreds of questions and comments you may make about your situation. Use the situation to fuel conversation. Be aware of the vast details abounding. These can be talked about. Once your discussion on the immediate environment dries up, expand and broaden the conversation to include events happening outside of where you are. You can discuss issues concerning a restaurant in the next town or a school in the next province. Ritual Questions Attraction Secrets file:///D|/pdf/attraction.htm (6 of 9) [12/28/2000 2:04:09 PM]"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Ritual questions must always follow the compliment or comment you make. Ritual questions are directly related to whatever your prospect may respond with. These questions can be closed or open. Closed questions are answered with one word replies. Examples can be, \"Do you like the food?\", \"So, you are a lawyer?\", \"What is that?\" Closed questions tend to begin with \"are\", \"who\", \"where\" and \"do\" Open questions encourage multi-paragraph replies and frequently begin with \"how\" or \"why.\" A typical open question can be, \"Why did you choose the ravioli?\" , \"How do you cope with those kids next door?\", \"In what ways do you think the tax budget can be decreased?\" Ritual questions break the ice and send the signal that you are deeply interested. It fuels conversation. A good practice would be to begin by making three or four closed questions. Once you have listened and opened up your prospect, begin asking open questions. Probe him for details that can fuel further questions, thus prolonging and energizing the conversation. Listen actively. l A problem plaguing many is not knowing what to say next. When our turn comes to speak, we clam up. This mental blank can be easily remedied. Do not worry about what to say! Simply listen carefully to whatever your companion says. When your turn comes to speak, make a follow up question related to his last few paragraphs. You may also paraphrase his last statement in a question format so as to invite him to continue talking. For instance, your companion may say ,\"I feel unappreciated at work and I want to quit!\" A good paraphrase will be, \" You don't think you'll work there anymore because your efforts are not recognized?\" or \" Now if I understand correctly, you don't find contentment in your job anymore?\" or \" Do you imply that....?\" Paraphrasing this way or making follow-up questions encourages your companion to keep speaking and relieves you of the burden of having to think of your own subjects. It demonstrates your attentiveness and interest. Remember that as you listen, lean forward slightly, nod at pertinent points and maintain eye contact. Follow up with questions to seek more information. l Attraction Secrets file:///D|/pdf/attraction.htm (7 of 9) [12/28/2000 2:04:09 PM]"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Seek more information. The more, the better. Use previously revealed data to uncover personal facts, opinions and dreams. It would help to seek common interests as well. You won't have to speak much by asking questions. In fact, the general rule for good conversationalists is the 70-30 Rule. The rule states that to be a brilliant conversationalist, you must listen 70% of the time and speak 30% of the time. By letting your companion speak more, you appear witty, charming, attentive and engaging. This secret can let you get away looking wonderful while doing very little. Pass the conversational ball back and forth. l You can't remain silent forever! When the time comes, reveal to your companion that you are just like him in certain ways. You do this by disclosing free information about yourself. The best time to do this would be when he reveals personal information similar to yours. For instance, you might say, \"Me too! I also love skiing in the Alps!\", or \"Likewise! I hate chilidogs because they burn my stomach.\" or \"That sound's like me! I just got beaten by a cop.\" With this opening, continue to elaborate on the similarity between you. You could further enrich the conversation by delving on other matters similarly related to the current topic. Once you disclose a paragraph or so about yourself, don't hog the conversation. Pass the ball back to your companion by giving another question. You may request for his opinion, comment or advice based on what you've just said. When your companion responds, share a little more about yourself, then pass the ball back to him. This act of passing the conversational ball back and forth balances the discussion and makes it ultimately satisfying. After the encounter, your new-found friend will crave to talk with you again! In summary: Engaging in conversation is the first step to realizing success. You must initiate contact in order to get your ideas across. Once you have made a prospect your friend, the miracles of social interaction will never cease cascading.

Defusing the Emotion Bombs Negating resentment and resistance. Encouraging Cooperation and Trust Negative emotions destroy communications. It hampers understanding, prevents trust and promotes simmering resentment. Most interpersonal relationships can be frayed by negative emotions. Anger, hatred, jealousy, and suspicion manifest obviously. When someone resists you for no apparent logical reason, a hidden emotion lurks behind it. Resistance and rejection is a tell tale sign of a hidden barrier that must be removed before successful communication can continue. Hidden barriers. They take many forms. Worry surfaces in secretiveness, obsession and withdrawal. Anger manifests in quarrels, gossip and lack of cooperation. Hurt masquerades as temper tantrums and the propensity to lash out. These emotions hinder progress! Arguing logically cannot quell someone's emotionally driven resistance. To break down the resistance requires identifying, then defusing the emotion. Once the emotions have been smoothed out, positive, constructive discussions can take place. To facilitate counseling, effective methods to neutralize negative emotions have been devised. These are Emotion Neutralizers. Emotion Neutralizers - Techniques to Deal with Emotions Technique 1: Use the AAAA attack. The mnemonic signifies :Agree, Apologize Act Appreciate. When someone lashes out and complains, agree with him that there is a problem. Say, \"It's alright to feel that way... I would, in the same position.\" or, \"I agree! That's a big problem, and you don't deserve to suffer it.\" By agreeing, you dispel further resistance.

The author of the well-written book Tongue Fu! developed this technique and discussed fine examples for its deployment. After agreeing , apologize that the situation is causing him discomfort. Whether you are directly or indirectly responsible is unimportant. He needs to hear someone feel sorry for his state. By apologizing, you satisfy that need. You can say, \"I'm sorry you feel that way!\" Act quickly. Offer some form of remedy to appease his emotions. If a customer is complaining of a defective product, offer a replacement. Appreciate . When applicable, verbally say thank you for any complaint. Explain that any criticism or complaint helps you to act quickly. For instance, you may say, \"I appreciate that you brought this matter to my attention.\" Once the situation has reached green light status, you may feel that you've apologized and given in too much. You may feel wimpy! Don't. Remember that your goal is to achieve a stable, emotionally positive situation. Once you have that positive ambiance, you can start getting what you want. Technique 2: Get the other person to keep talking. Emotional distress, like a fire, must be vented. The best technique to smother the coals of heated emotion is to encourage open expression. Resist the temptation to speak or butt in. Pay attention and listen till your angry prospect burns out his emotional flames. Eventually, the harangue will reveal the source of his distress. Identifying this source empowers you to act from the right angle. At one point, your companion may lapse into silence and his emotion may yet continue blazing bright. Encourage him to continue talking. Say \" Tell me some more! Your case concerns me.\" Elaborating more on his problem, your worrisome companion will release his anxiety until he is purged of emotion. This state is called catharsis. This is your objective. Listen. Simply by listening, you aid the diffusion of tension. Technique 3: Never say that you \"understand how someone feels\". No one can fully comprehend what is going on inside someone's heart. To claim to understand will brand you as insincere. Assume that a soldier goes to you, complaining how miserable his life had been since he lost his legs in a war. You can't say, \"I understand how you feel,\" because you have two perfectly good legs! The soldier will dislike you for pretending to know. He will wonder just how much Emotion Bombs file:///D|/pdf/emotion_bombs.htm (2 of 4) [12/28/2000 2:04:09 PM]"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"\"understanding\" you truly have. Instead of falsely \"understanding\" someone, demonstrate that you accept what the other person is going through. Show that you see he has a problem. This key works wonders. In the previous scenario you could have demonstrated your awareness of the soldier's problem by saying, \"I have a friend who's crippled for life because of a car wreck. He can't ever walk despite numerous operations. I saw how tough his life had become because of his diminished capacity. You have a similar problem. I pray that just as he had gotten over his difficulty, you can devote your energies to other endeavors and get on with life.\" This last statement gets the idea across that you are attuned to the soldier's quandary. Without saying, \"I know how you feel,\" you demonstrated your sympathy and awareness in a single, dramatic flourish. Technique 4: Show acceptance and understanding by paraphrasing. Mirror the feelings of your companion. Play it back to them by paraphrasing what the say. Reflect the other person's emotions in a way that demonstrates acceptance and understanding. To paraphrase, take the emotionally charged statements of the other person and express it in your words. Usually, end it in an upward inflection so it sounds like a question. This will encourage him to continue elaborating. Somebody may say, \" I think I'm gonna quit school. My parents don't care whether I get good grades or not. So what is the point? I enjoy the teachers and friends, but the whole point is the approval of my parents\" You can reply, \" School is fun, but because your parents don't give a damn, you want out?\" By paraphrasing, you signal understanding. Nevertheless, you must remain neutral. Neither agree nor disagree with his statements. When you paraphrase, the other person will continue elaborating until you have \"walked him through\" his emotional turmoil. Technique 5: Empathy - Platinum Rule. Worth a million dollars, the secret of empathy building can help you in tough spots, attract others to you and win the agreement of opponents. When you empathize, you wholly step into the other person's shoes and see thing from his perspective as well as grasp why he thinks and feels that way. Unconditionally, you focus on his feelings. You pretend that you are that other person. Empathizing requires full detachment from an your Emotion Bombs file:///D|/pdf/emotion_bombs.htm (3 of 4) [12/28/2000 2:04:09 PM]"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"awareness of yourself. You replace your personal frame of reference with that of your companion. Master persuaders go as far as to imagine that they are wearing the same clothes as the other person. They step into the other person's bodies and try to get a tangible feel as to what it would be like to see from out their eyes and feel the clothes that they wear. To facilitate empathy, imagine that there is a line on the ground between the both of you. Imagine crossing that line and being that other person. What you now feel and say are what the other person would say. Having this grasp enables you to have a broad understanding of the entire situation. This method of empathizing forces you to be aware of details that you were formerly oblivious to. Empathizing allows you to see and sense things from your prospect's perspective. This helps you word your statements aptly and to further develop conversations. Empathy helps you attract just about anybody. Empathy is the ultimate form of acceptance. It makes others feel special. It is hard to maintain an adversarial stance with someone who strives to be understanding. When you show people that you are capable of seeing things from their point of view, they will begin to listen and open up. This occurs since you have put their feelings before yours. Aside from stepping into the other person's shoes, you empathize by talking about what the other person wants to talk about. Show interest in his interest. Find common preference, experiences, and opinions. Listen carefully to his replies and respond with empathizing statements such as: \"I see that you....\" \"No wonder you feel...\" \"I can understand that... \" \"I'm concerned that...\" \"I appreciate that....\" \"I can identify with that....\" Cultivate the skill of empathy.

Leveraging Your Vocal Power The Golden Tongue We do most of our communication with our voice. To convey thoughts, ideas and needs we use our facility of speech. Does your voice work for or against you? Persuasive speakers know that vocal quality ranks just as importantly as the speech content. Tempo, speed, timbre, resonance, inflection... all these factors influence how well your message is received. It is important to put your best voice forward. A weak voice undermines your assertion and dulls your persuasive edge. Whether you are persuading, wooing or ordering, learn to speak with confidence. You can radiate charm with your voice! This chapter teaches essential voice enhancing techniques that can make your pitch irresistible. Most of the advice draw from common sense -- we consistently need to be reminded of what we already know. Your Voice on Steroids - Pump Up the Charm! Speak from the stomach. Untrained speakers normally breathe from the upper part of their chest when articulating, thereby robbing power from their full vocal potential. l By exhaling from the stomach as you speak, you can add Golden Tongue file:///D|/pdf/golden_tongue.htm (1 of 4) [12/28/2000 2:04:10 PM]"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"luster and gusto to your vocal quality. You voice instantly lowers and acquires a fuller and richer tone. To harness this method of speaking, practice talking while pressing your hand against your stomach. Feel yourself exhaling from your abdomen as you breathe out your words. Experience the rumbling of your stomach as you enunciate. When you get the hang of it, listen to yourself in a voice recorder. You'll be pleasantly surprised by the change. Whiny, high pitched speakers can dramatically improve their vocal tone through this simple exercise. Charge your words emotionally. A flat voice bores and annoys. Vary your vocal quality by making emotionally charged words sound emotional. When you say, \"enticing\", do make it sound enticing. Curl your tongue and breathe out the word \"enticing\" enticingly. l When you utter \"excited,\" do sound excited. Ring out with eagerness. Squeal a bit. When you say \"confidence,\" brace yourself and thunder the word confidence in a firm tone. Speakers who employ this technique easily gain followers. Their enthusiasm resounds clearly, shrouding them in a mantle of charisma. Use proper inflection. Learn to end statements, orders and declaratives with a downward inflection. This entails ending your statements with a period. Queries can also be ended with a downward inflection. Upward inflections weaken a statement. Questions normally end in upward inflections. Notice how weak questions sound. l Match your prospect's tone and tempo. A great way to build rapport is to match the rate at which your prospect speaks and to mimic his inflections. By approximating his manner of speech, you subconsciously gain his trust and approval. Persuasion becomes a lot easier. l Stand properly. Air cannot travel well if you slouch. Clear your throat, stand tall and proud.

Show, Don't Tell. Charge your speech with color and \"visuals.\" Visual snapshots enervate and persuade more effectively than a thousand words. Instead of labeling a person, situation or object, describe it objectively to drive home your message. This is the art of word painting. l Compare the drab version and the colorful, restated version: (labeling) \"The day was so beautiful. I enjoyed it!\" versus--> (describing) \"I saw fleecy clouds sailing across a sea-blue sky. The birds kept knocking at my window. Later, the afternoon brought gentle rains that watered the carpet of flowers outside. Rather than labeling, report what you see, hear or feel! When praising someone's handiwork, don't say ,\"That is quality work.\". Instead, say, \"Your craftsmanship shows meticulous attention to design as well as smooth plaster finishing.\" It is up to the other person to interpret your objective reports. The Show Don't Tell technique also works great when correcting others. Report the facts as you see them. Don't color it with judgments. When you receive an unsatisfactory repair job, don't say, \"My mechanic is lousy; he does a terrible job.\" Instead, say, \"My mechanic forgot to replace the oil hose, which led to the breakdown of the internal combustion engine. Now I have a useless vehicle.\" Those whom you complain to will appreciate your objectivity and respond receptively. In Summary: What you say is important. How you say it is all the more crucial.
