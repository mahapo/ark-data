I wish I could go back in time and thank them all, and I take delight in this chance to thank the people who most helped and supported me during the year I wrote The Sociopath Next Door. For her commentary and utter indispensability, and her patience, I thank my friend and colleague Carol Kauffman, she of the legendary creativity at solving problems, whose generosity never skipped a beat, even though she was in the middle of writing Pivot Points . Because none of this would have been possible without her mov­ ing commitment to her mission, and for her having been always a deep well of grace, comprehension, and heart in a wide desert, I thank my agent and treasured friend, Susan Lee Cohen. If I had attempted to design the world's most superb editor, I could not have done nearly so well as Kristine Puopolo at Broadway Books, and I thank her for her intelligence, her precision, and her ex­ traordinary ability to be quietly right, always, without ever being in­ trusive. I thank Diane Wemyss for her caring and her organizing, and for having suggested one of the events I write about, and Elizabeth Haymaker for her charm across the miles. - XI"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I thank Steve Stout and Darcy Wakefield, for making me believe in love again.

At the very heart of psychotherapy is the precept of confiden­ tiality , and as usual I have taken the most exacting measures to preserve the privacy of all real persons. All names are fictitious, and all other recognizable features have been changed. Some individuals who appear in the book willingly gave their consent to be anony­ mously portrayed. In these cases, no information has been included that might in any way identify them. The story in the chapter entitled \"Groundhog Day\" is fiction. Otherwise, the people, events, and conversations presented here are taken from my twenty-five-year practice of psychology. However, be­ cause of my commitment to confidentiality , the people and circum­ stances portrayed in these pages are composite in nature; that is to say, each case represents a great many individuals whose character­ istics and experiences have been adopted conceptually , carefully altered in their specifics, and combined to form an illustrative char­ acter.

ImagIne Minds differ still more than fa ces. -Voltaire I magine-if you can-not having a conscience, none at all, no feel­ ings of guilt or remorse no matter what you do, no limiting sense of concern for the well-being of strangers, friends, or even family members. Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken. And pretend that the concept of responsibil­ ity is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools. Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological . makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply as­ sumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless. You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal ex­ perience, that they seldom even guess at your condition."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MART HA STOUT In other words, you are completely free of internal restraints, and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please, with no pangs of conscience, is conveniently invisible to the world. You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences, will most likely remain undiscovered. How will you live your life? What will you do with your huge and secret advantage, and with the corresponding handicap of other peo­ ple (conscience)? The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be, because people are not all the same. Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same. Some people­ whether they have a conscience or not-favor the ease of inertia, while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions. Some human beings are brilliant and talented, some are dull-witted, and most, conscience or not, are somewhere in between. There are violent peo­ ple and nonviolent ones, individuals who are motivated by blood lust and those who have no such appetites. Maybe you are someone who craves money and power, and though you have no vestige of conscience, you do have a magnificent IQ. You have the driving nature and the intellectual capacity to pur­ sue tremendous wealth and influence, and you are in no way moved by the nagging voice of conscience that prevents other people from doing everything and anything they have to do to succeed. You choose business, politics, the law, banking, or international develop­ ment, or any of a broad array of other power professions, and you pursue your career with a cold passion that tolerates none of the usual moral or legal incumbrances. When it is expedient, you doctor the accounting and shred the evidence, you stab your employees and your clients (or your constituency) in the back, marry for money , tell lethal premeditated lies to people who trust you, attempt to ruin colleagues who are powerful or eloquent, and simply steamroll over groups who are dependent and voiceless. And all of this you do with 2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR the exquisite freedom that results from having no conscience what­ soever. You become unimagina bly, unassaila bly , and maybe even globally successful. Why not? With your big brain, and no conscience to rein in your schemes, you can do anything at all. Or no--let us say you are not quite such a person. You are am­ bitious, yes, and in the name of success you are willing to do all man­ ner of things that people with conscience would never consid er, but you are not an intellectually gifted individual. Your intelligence is above average perhaps, and people think of you as smart, maybe even very smart. But you know in your heart of hearts that you do not have the cognitive wherewithal, or the creativity , to reach the careening heights of power you secretly dream about, and this makes you resentful of the world at large, and envious of the people around you. As this sort of person, you ensconce yourself in a niche, or maybe a series of niches, in which you can have some amount of control over small numbers of people. These situations satisfy a little of your desire for power, although you are chronically aggravated at not hav­ ing more. It chafes to be so free of the ridiculous inner voice that in­ hibits others from achieving great power, without having enough talent to pursue the ultimate successes yourself. Sometimes you fall into sulky, rageful moods caused by a frustration that no one but you understands. But you do enjoy jobs that afford you a certain undersupervised control over a few individuals or small groups, preferably people and groups who are relatively helpless or in some way vulnerable. You are a teacher or a psychotherapist, a divorce lawyer or a high school coach. Or maybe you are a consultant of some kind, a broker or a gallery owner or a human services director. Or maybe you do not have a paid position and are instead the president of your condo­ minium association, or a volunteer hospital worker, or a parent. 3"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MA RTHA STOUT Whatever your job, you manipulate and bully the people who are un­ der your thumb, as often and as outrageously as you can without get­ ting fired or held accountable. You do this for its own sake, even when it serves no purpose except to give you a thrill. Making people jump means you have power-or this is the way you see it-and bul­ lying provides you with an adrenaline rush. It is fun. Maybe you cannot be the CEO of a multinational corporation, but you can frighten a few people, or cause them to scurry around like chickens, or steal from them, or-maybe best of all-create sit­ uations that cause them to feel bad about themselves. And this is power, especially when the people you manipulate are superior to you in some way. Most invigorating of all is to bring down people who are smarter or more accomplished than you, or perhaps classier, more attractive or popular or morally admirable. This is not only good fun; it is existential vengeance. And without a conscience, it is amazingly easy to do. You quietly lie to the boss or to the boss's boss, cry some crocodile tears, or sabotage a coworker's project, or gas­ light a patient (or a child), bait people with promises, or provide a little misinformation that will never be traced back to you. Or now let us say you are a person who has a proclivity for vio­ lence or for seeing violence done. You can simply murder your coworker, or have her murdered-or your boss, or your ex-spouse, or your wealthy lover's spouse, or anyone else who bothers you. You have to be careful, because if you slip up, you may be caught and punished by the system. But you will never be confronted by your conscience, because you have no conscience. If you decide to kill, the only difficulties will be the external ones. Nothing inside of you will ever protest. Provided you are not forcibly stopped, you can do anything at all. If you are born at the right time, with some access to family fortune, and you have a special talent for whipping up other people's hatred and sense of deprivation, you can arrange to kill large numbers of unsuspecting people. With enough money, you can accomplish this 4"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE SOCIO PATH NEXT DOOR from far away , and you can sit back safely and watch in satisfaction. In fact, terrorism (done from a distance) is the ideal occupation for a person who is possessed of blood lust and no conscience, because if you do it just right, you may be able to make a whole nation jump. And if that is not power, what is? Or let us imagine the opposite extreme: You have no interest in power. To the contrary , you are the sort of person who really does not want much of anything. Your only real ambition is not to have to ex­ ert yourself to get by. You do not want to work like everyone else does. Without a conscience, you can nap or pursue your hobbies or watch television or just hang out somewhere all day long. Living a bit on the fringes, and with some handouts from relatives and friends, you can do this inde finitely . People may whisper to one another that you are an underachiever, or that you are depressed, a sad case, or, in contrast, if they get angry , they may grumble that you are lazy. When they get to know you better, and get really angry, they may scream at you and call you a loser, a bum. But it will never occur to them that you literally do not have a conscience, that in such a fun­ damental way, your very mind is not the same as theirs. The panicked feeling of a guilty conscience never squeezes at your heart or wakes you in the middle of the night. Despite your lifestyle, you never feel irresponsible, neglectful, or so much as em­ barrassed, although for the sake of appearances, sometimes you pre­ tend that you do. For example, if you are a decent observer of people and what they react to, you may adopt a lifeless facial expression, say how ashamed of your life you are, and talk about how rotten you feel. This you do only because it is more convenient to have people think you are depressed than it is to have them shouting at you all the time, or insisting that you get a: job. You notice that people who do have a conscience feel guilty when they harangue someone they believe to be \"depressed\" or \"troubled.\" As a matter of fact, to your further advantage, they often feel obliged to take care of such a person. If, despite your relative poverty , you 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOU T can manage to get yourself into a sexual relationship with someone, this person-who does not suspect what you are really like-may feel particularly obligated. And since all you want is not to have to work, your financier does not have to be especially rich, just reliably conscience-bound. I trust that imagining yourself as any of these people feels insane to you, because such people are insane, dangerously so. Insane but real-they even have a label. Many mental health professionals refer to the condition of little or no conscience as \"antisocial personality disorder, \" a noncorrectable disfigurement of character that is now thought to be present in about 4 percent of the population-that is to say, one in twenty-five people. This condition of missing con­ science is called by other names, too, most often \"sociopathy ,\" or the somewhat more familiar term, psychopathy. Guiltlessness was in fact the first personality disorder to be recognized by psychiatry , and terms that have been used at times over the past century include manie sans d€lire, psychopathic inferiorit y, moral insanity, and moral im­ becility. According to the current bible of psychiatric labels, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders N of the American Psychiatric Association, the clinical diagnosis of \"antiso­ cial personality disorder\" should be considered when an individual possesses at least three of the following seven characteristics: (1) failure to conform to social norms; (2) deceitfulness, manipulative­ ness; (3) impulsivi ty, failure to plan ahead; (4) irritability , aggres­ siveness; (5) reckless disregard for the safety of self or others; (6) consistent irresponsibility; (7) lack of remorse after having hurt, mis­ treated, or stolen from another person. The presence in an individ­ ual of any three of these \"symptoms,\" taken togeth er, is enough to make many psychiatrists suspect the disorder. Other researchers and clinicians, many of whom think the APA's definition describes simple \"criminality\" better than true \"psychopa­ thy\" or \"sociopathy ,\" point to additional documented characteristics 6"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE SOCIO PATH NEXT DOOR of sociopaths as a group. One of the more frequently observed of these traits is a glib and superficial charm that allows the true so­ ciopath to seduce other people, figuratively or literally-a kind of glow or charisma that, initially, can make the sociopath seem more charming or more interesting than most of the normal people around him. He or she is more spontaneous, or more intense, or somehow more \"complex,\" or sexier, or more entertaining than everyone else. Sometimes this \"sociopathic charis ma\" is accompa­ nied by a grandiose sense of self-worth that may be compelling at first, but upon closer inspection may seem odd or perhaps laughable. (\"Someday the world will realize how special I am,\" or \"You know that after me, 'no other lover will do,\") In addition, sociopaths have a greater than normal need for stim­ ulation, which results in their taking frequent social, physical, finan­ cial, or legal risks. Characteristically, they can charm others into attempting dangerous ventures with them, and as a group they are known for their pathological lying and conning, and their parasitic relationships with \"friends. \" Regardless of how educated or highly placed as adults, they may have a history of early behavior problems, sometimes including drug use or recorded juvenile delinquency, and always including a failure to acknowledge responsibility for any prob­ lems that occurred. And sociopaths are noted especially for their shallowness of emo­ tion, the hollow and transient nature of any affectionate feelings they may claim to have, a certain breathtaking callousness. They have no trace of empathy and no genuine interest in bonding emo­ tionally with a mate. Once the surface charm is scraped off, their marriages are loveless, one-sided, and almost always short-term. If a marriage partner has any value to the sociopath, it is because the partner is viewed as a possession, one that the sociopath may feel an­ gry to lose, but never sad or accountable. All of these characteristics, along with the \"symptoms\" listed by the American Psychiatric Association, are the behavioral manifesta- 7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT tions of what is for most of us an unfathomable psychological con­ dition, the absence of our essential seventh sense-conscience. Crazy, and frightening-and real, in about 4 percent of the pop­ ulation. But what does 4 percent really mean to society? As points of ref­ erence to problems we hear about more often, consider the follow­ ing statistics: The prevalence rate for anorexic eating disorders is estimated at 3.43 percent, deemed to be nearly epidemic, and yet this figure is a fraction lower than the rate for antisocial personality. The high-profile disorders classed as schizophrenia occur in only about 1 percent of us-a mere quarter of the rate of antisocial per­ sonality-and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the rate of colon cancer in the United States, considered \"alarmingly high,\" is about 40 per 100, 000-one hundred times lower than the rate of antisocial personality. Put more succinctly, there are more sociopaths among us than people who suffer from the much-publicized disorder of anorexia, four times as many sociopaths as schizophrenics, and one hundred times as many sociopaths as people diagnosed with a known scourge such as colon cancer. As a therapist, I specialize in the treatment of psychological trauma survivors. Over the last twenty-five years, my practice has in­ cluded hundreds of adults who have been in psychological pain every day of their lives on account of early childhood abuse or some other horrendous past experience. As I have detailed in case studies in The Myth of Sanity, my trauma patients suffer from a host of torments, including chronic anxiety, incapacitating depression, and dissocia­ tive mental states, and, feeling that their time on earth was unbear­ able, many of them have come to me after recovering from attempts to commit suicide. Some have been traumatized by natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes and wars, but most of them have been controlled and psychologically shattered by individual human perpetrators, often sociopaths-sometimes sociopathic strangers, but more typically sociopathic parents, older relatives, or 8"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR siblings. In helping my patients and their families cope with the harm done to their lives, and in studying their case histories, I have learned that ' the damage caused by the sociopaths among us is deep and lasting, often tragically lethal, and startlingly common. Working with hundreds of survivors, I have become convinced that dealing openly and directly with the facts about sociopathy is a matter of ur­ gency for us all. About one in twenty-five individuals are sociopathic, meaning, essentially, that they do not have a conscience. It is not that this group fails to grasp the difference between good and bad; it is that the distinction fails to limit their behavior . The intellectual difference between right and wrong does not bring on the emotional sirens and flashing blue lights, or the fear of God, that it does for the rest of us. Without the slightest blip of guilt or remorse, one in twenty-five peo­ ple can do anything at all. The high incidence of sociopathy in human society has a pro­ found effect on the rest of us who must live on this planet, too, even those of us who have not been clinically traumatized. The individu­ als who constitute this 4 percent drain our relationships, our bank accounts, our accomplishments, our self-esteem, our very peace on earth. Yet surprisin gly, many people know nothing about this disorder, or if they do, they think only in terms of violent psychopa­ thy-murderers, serial killers, mass murderers-people who have con­ spicuously broken the law many times over, and who, if caught, will be imprisoned, maybe even put to death by our legal system. We are not commonly aware of, nor do we usually identify , the larger num­ ber of nonviolent sociopaths among us, people who often are not blatant lawbreakers, and against whom our formal legal system pro­ vides little defense. Most of us would not imagine any correspondence between con­ ceiving an ethnic genocide and, say, guiltlessly lying to one's boss about a coworker. But the psychological correspondence is not only there; it is chilling. Simple and profound, the link is the absence of 9"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT the inner mechanism that beats up on us, emotionally speaking, when we make a choice we view as immoral, unethical, neglectful, or selfish. Most of us feel mildly guilty if we eat the last piece of cake in the kitchen, let alone what we would feel if we intentionally and methodically set about to hurt another person. Those who have no conscience at all are a group unto themselves, whether they be homi­ cidal tyrants or merely ruthless social snipers. The presence or absence of conscience is a deep human division, arguably more significant than intelligence, race, or even gender. What differentiates a sociopath who lives off the labors of others from one who occasionally robs convenience stores, or from one who is a contemporary robber baron�or what makes the difference be­ tween an ordinary bully and a sociopathic murderer-is nothing more than social status, drive, intellect, blood lust, or simple oppor­ tunity. What distinguishes all of these people from the rest of us is an utterly empty hole in the psyche, where there should be the most evolved of all humanizing functions. For something like 96 percent of us, conscience is so fundamen­ tal that we seldom even think a bout it. For the most part, it acts like a reflex. Unless temptation is extremely great (which, thankfully , on a day-to-day basis it usually is not), we by no means reflect on each and every moral question that comes our way. We do not seriously ask ourselves, Shall I give my child lunch money today, or not? Shall I steal my coworker's briefcase today, or not? Shall I walk out on my spouse today, or not? Conscience makes all of these decisions for us, so quietly , automatically, and continually that, in our most creative flights of imagination, we would not be able to conjure the image of an existence without conscience. And so, naturally, when someone makes a truly conscienceless choice, all we can produce are explana­ tions that come nowhere near the truth: She forgot to give lunch money to her child. That person's coworker must have misplaced her briefcase. That person's spouse must have been impossible to live with. Or we come up with labels that, provided we do not inspect too - 10 -"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOPATH NEXT DOOR closely, almost explain another person's antisocial behavior: He is \"eccentric, \" or \"artistic, \" or \"really competitiv e, \" or \"lazy, \" or \"clue­ less, \" or \"always such a rogu e. \" Except for the psychopathic monsters we sometimes see on tele­ vision, whose actions are too horrific to explain away , conscienceless people are nearly always invisible to us. We are keenly interested in how smart we are, and in the intelligence level of other people. The smallest child can tell the difference between a girl and a boy . We fight wars over race. But as to what is possibly the single most mean­ in gf ul characteristic that divides the human species-the presence or absence of conscience-we remain effectively oblivious. Very few people, no matter how educated they are in other ways, know the meaning of the word sociopathic. Far less do they under­ stand that, in all probability, the word could be properly applied to a handful of people they actually know. And even after we have learned the label for it, being devoid of conscience is impossible for most human beings to fantasize about. In fact, it is difficult to think of another experience that quite so eludes empat hy. To tal blindness, clinical depression, profound cognitive deficit, winning the lottery, and a thousand other extremes of human experience, even psy­ chosis, are accessible to our imaginations. We have all been lost in the dark. We have all been somewhat depressed. We have all felt stu­ pid, at least once or twice. Most of us have made the mental list of what we would do with a windfall fortune. And in our dreams at night, our thoughts and our images are deranged. But not to care at all about the effects of our actions on society , on friends, on fami ly, on our children? What on earth would that be like? What would we do with ourselves? Nothing in our lives, waking or sleeping, informs us. The closest we come, perhaps, is the experi­ ence of being in so much physical pain that our ability to reason or act is temporarily paralyzed. But even in pain there is guilt. Absolute guiltlessness defies the imagination. Conscience is our omniscient taskmaster, setting the rules for our - 11 -"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT actions and meting out emotional punishments when we brea � the rules. We never asked for conscience. It is just there, all the time, like skin or lungs or heart. In a manner of speaking, we cannot even take credit. And we cannot imagine what we would feel like without it. Guiltlessness is uniquely confusing as a medical concept, too. Quite unlike cancer, anorexia, schizophrenia, depression, or even the other \"character disorders,\" such as narcissism, sociopathy would seem to have a moral aspect. Sociopaths are almost invariably seen as bad or diabolical, even by (or perhaps especially by) mental health professionals, and the sentiment that these patients are somehow morally offensive and scary comes across vividly in the literature. Robert Hare, a professor of psychology at the University of B ritish Columbia, has developed an inventory called the Psychopathy Checklist, now accepted as a standard diagnostic instrument for re­ searchers and clinicians worldwide. Of his subjects, Hare, the dis­ passionate scientist, writes, \"Everyone, including the experts, can be taken in, manipulated, conned, and left bewildered by them. A good psychopath can play a concerto on anyones heartstrings .... Your best defense is to understand the nature of these human predators.\" And Hervey Cleckley, author of the 1941 classic text The Mask of Sanity, makes this complaint of the psychopath: \"Beauty and ugli­ ness, except in a very superficial sense, goodness, evil, love, horr or, and humor have no actual meaning, no power to move him. \" The argument can easily be made that \"sociopathy\" and \"antiso­ cial personality disord er\" and \"psychopathy\" are misnomers, reflect­ ing an unstable mix of ideas, and that the absence of conscience does not really make sense as a psychiatric category in the first place. In this regard, it is crucial to note that all of the other psychiatric di­ agnoses (including narcissism) involve some amount of personal dis­ tress or misery for the individuals who suffer from them. Sociopathy stands alone as a \"disease\" that causes no dis-ease for the person who has it, no sub jective discomfort. Sociopaths are often quite satisfied with themselves and with their lives, and perhaps for this very reason - 1 2 -"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOPATH NEXT DOOR there is no effective \"treatment. \" Typically, sociopaths enter therapy only when they have been court-referred, or when there is some sec­ ondary gain to be had from being a patient. Wanting to get better is seldom the true issue. All of this begs the question of whether the absence of conscience is a psychiatric disorder or a legal designa­ tion-or something else altogether. Singular in its ability to unnerve even seasoned professionals, the concept of sociopathy comes perilously close to our notions of the soul, of evil versus good, and this association makes the topic diffi­ cult to think about clear ly. And the unavoidable them-versus-us na­ ture of the problem raises scientific, moral, and political issues that boggle the mind. How does one scientifically study a phenomenon that appears to be, in part, a moral one? Who should receive our pro­ fessional help and support, the \"patients\" or the people who must endure them? Since psychological research is generating ways to \"di­ agnose\" sociopathy, whom should we test? Should anyone be tested for such a thing in a free society? And if someone has been clearly identified as a sociopath, what, if anything, can society do with that information? No other diagnosis raises such politically and profes­ sionally incorrect questions, and sociopathy, with its known relation­ ship to behaviors ranging from spouse battering and rape to serial murder and warmongering, is in some sense the last and most fright­ ening psychological frontier. Indeed, the most unnerving questions are seldom even whis­ pered: Can we say for sure that sociopathy does not work for the in­ dividual who has it? Is sociopathy a disorder at all, or is it functional? Just as unwelcome is the uncertainty on the flip side of that coin: Does conscience work for the individual, or group, who has it? Or is conscience, as more than one sociopath has implied, simply a psy­ chological corral for the masses? Whether we speak them out loud or not, doubts like these implicitly loom large on a planet where for thousands of years, and right up to the present moment, the most universally famous names have always belonged to those who could - 13 -"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT manage to be amoral on a large-enough scale. And in our present­ day culture, using other people has become almost tren dy, and un­ conscionable business practices appear to yield unlimited wealth. On a personal level, most of us have examples from our own lives in which someone unscrupulous has won, and there are times when having integrity begins to feel like merely playing the fool. Is it the case that cheaters never prosper, or is it true, after all, that nice guys finish last? Will the shameless minority really inherit the earth? Such questions reflect a central concern of this book, a theme that occurred to me just after the catastrophes of September 11, 200 I, propelled all people of conscience into anguish, and some into despair . I am usually an optimistic person, but at that time, along with a number of other psychologists and students of human nature, I feared that my country and many others would fall into hate-filled conflicts and vengeful wars that would preoccupy us for many years to come. From nowhere, a line from a thirty-year-old apocalyptic song invaded my thoughts whenever I tried to relax or sleep: \"Satan, laughing, spreads his wings. \" The winged Satan in my mind's eye, roaring with cynical laughter and rising from the wreckage, was not a terrorist, but a demonic manipulator who used the terrorists' acts to ignite the kindling of hatred all over the globe. I became interested in my particular topic of sociopathy versus conscience during a phone conversation with a colleague of mine, a good man who is normally upbeat and full of encouragement but who was at that moment stunned and demoralized along with the rest of the world. We were discussing a mutual patient whose suici­ dal symptoms had become alarmingly worse, apparently on account of the disasters in the United States (and who has improved a great deal since then, I am relieved to report). My colleague was saying how guilty he felt because he was torn apart himself and might not have the usual amount of emotional energy to give to the patient. This extraordinarily caring and responsible therapist, overwhelmed - 14 -"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR by events, like everyone else, believed he was being remiss. In the middle of judging himself, he stopped, sighed, and said to me in a weary voice highly uncharacteristic of him, \"You know, sometimes I wonder, Why have a conscience? It just puts you on the losing team. \" I was very much taken aback by his question, mostly because cynicism was so unlike this man's usual hale and hearty frame of mind. After a moment, I replied with another question. I said, \"So tell me, Bernie. If you had a choice, I mean really, literally had a choice in the matter-which you don't, of course-would you choose to have a conscience like you do, or would you prefer to be sociopathic, and capable of ... well, anything at all?\" He considered this and said, \"You're right\" (although I had not meant to imply telepathy).

He sounded slightly less defeated, and we started to talk about what one of our professional organizations planned to do for the people in New York and Washington. After that conversation, and for a very long time, I remained in­ trigued by my colleague's question, \"Why have a conscience?\" and by his preference to be conscience-bound rather than conscience-free, and by the fact that he did not know why he would make this choice. A moralist or a theologian might well have answered, \"Because it's right, \" or \"Because I want to be a good person.\" But my friend the psychologist could not give a psychologi cal answer. I feel strongly that we need to know the psychological reason.

In part, this book is my answer, as a psychologist, to that question, \"Why have a conscienc e? \" To get to the reasons, I first discuss people who are without conscience, the sociopaths-how they behave, how they feel-so that we can look more meaningfully into the value, for the other 96 percent of us, of possessing a trait that can be aggravating, painful, and-yes, it is true-limiting. What follows is a psycholo­ gist's celebration of the still small voice, and of the great majority of human beings who find themselves graced with a conscience. It is a book for those of us who cannot imagine any other way to live. The book is also my attempt to warn good people about \"the so­ ciopath next door, \" and to help them cope. As a psychologist and as a person, I have seen far too many lives nearly obliterated by the choices and acts of a conscienceless few . These few are both dan­ gerous and remarkably difficult to identify . Even when they are not physically violent-and especially when they are familiar and close to us-they are all too capable of mangling individual lives, and of mak­ ing human society as a whole an unsafe place to be. To my mind, this dominance over the rest of us by people who have no conscience at all constitutes an especially widespread and appalling example of what novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald referred to as \"the tyranny of the weak. \" And I believe that all people of conscience should learn what the everyday behavior of these people looks like, so they can recog­ nize and deal effectively with the morally weak and the ruthless. Where conscience is concerned, we seem to be a species of ex­ tremes. We have only to turn on our televisions to see this bewilder­ ing dichoto my, to encounter images of people on their hands and knees rescuing a puppy from a drainage pipe, followed by reports of other human beings slaughtering women and children and stacking the corpses. And in our ordinary daily lives, though perhaps not so dramatica lly, we see the contrasts just as plentifully.

Given the radically contradictory behavior we witness every day, we must talk openly about both extremes of human personality and behavior. To create a better world, we need to understand the nature of people who routinely act against the common good, and who do so with emotional impunity . Only by seeking to discover the nature of ruthlessness can we find the many ways people can triumph over it, and only by recognizing the dark can we make a genuine affirma­ tion of the light. It is my hope that this book will play some part in limiting the so­ ciopath's destructive impact on our lives. As individuals, people of conscience can learn to recognize \"the sociopath next door,\" and with that knowledge work to defeat his entirely self-interested aims. At the very least, they can protect themselves and their loved ones from his shameless maneuverings. - 17 -"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"the se venth se nse � . ��/C. .

He needs to keep up a good impression with the more senior members of his firm, which means just about everybo dy, and he would like to have the first word with these wealthy clients, whose concerns include Joe's budding specialty of estate planning. He has been preparing his agenda for days because he feels there is a lot at stake, and he very much wants to be in the conf erence room at the start of the meeting. Unfor tunatel y, the furnace in Joe's town house sudde nly stopped making heat in the middle of the night. Freezing and pacing, afraid the pipes would burst, he had to wait for the emergency repairman from the fuel company before he could leave for work this morning. When the man showed up, Joe let him in and then, desper ate to get to the meeting, abandoned him in the toWn house to fix the furnace , hoping the fellow would prove reasonably honest. At last, Joe was - 19 -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT able to race to his Audi and set off for the office, but with only twenty-five minutes left to make a thirty-minute drive. He resol ved to bend the rules a little and make up the time. Now Joe is speeding along a fa miliar route to work, clenching his teeth and swearing under his breath at the slow drive rs, at all the driv­ ers really. He reinterprets a couple of red lights, passes a line of traf­ fic by using the breakdo wn lane, and clings frantically to the hope that he can somehow make it to the office by 8:00. When he hits three green lights in a row, he thinks that he may just succe ed. With his right hand, he reaches over to touch the overnight bag in the pas­ senger's seat, to reassure himself that he remembered to bring it. In addition to everything else, he has to catch a 10: 15 plane to New York this morning, a trip for the firm, and there will certainly not be time after the meeting to go back home for his things. His hand con­ tacts the cushiony leather of the bag-it is there and packed. And at this very moment, Joe remembers. He forgot to feed Reebok. Reebok is Joe's three-year-old blond Labrador retrie ver, so named because, before he got too busy at the firm, Joe used to take early-mo rn: ing runs with his enthusiastic new pet. When work took over and the morning routine changed, Joe fenced in the small back­ yard and installed a doggy door in the basemen t, allowing the dog solo access to the outside. At this point, runs together in the park are weekends only. But exercise or not, Reebok consumes several pounds of Science Diet every week, along with a huge assor tment of ' leftove r human food and at least one full box of jumbo bone treats. The young dog's appetite is stupendous, and he seems to live quite happily for two pleasures alone-his time with Joe, and his food. Joe got Reebok as a puppy, because when Joe was a boy, his fa­ ther would not let him have a pet, and he had vowed to himself that when he was grown up and succes sful, he would have a dog, a big one. At first, Reebok had been not very different from the Audi, an­ other acquisition, a marker of Joe's independence and material pros­ perity. But soon Joe had fallen in love with the animal himse lf. How - 20 -"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR , could he not? Reebok adored Joe unconditio nally, and from puppy­ hood had followed him around the house as if Joe were the cente r of .. all that was good in the unive rse. As his puppy grew to doghood, Joe realized that this creature had as distinct and individual a personal­ ity as any human being, and that his liquid brown eyes containe d at least as much soul. Now, whenever Joe looks into those eyes, Reebok wrinkle s his soft beige brow into several folded-carpet furrows and stares back. In this way, the sweet, ungainly dog appears preternatu­ rally thoughtf ul, as if he can read Joe's mind and is concern ed. Sometimes when there is a business trip, like toda y, Joe is gone from home for a day and a half, or even a little longer, and each time he comes back, Reebok greets him at the door with bounding joy and instant aneous forgive ness. Before he takes one of these trips , Joe always leaves large mixing bowls full of food and water for Reebok to consume in his absence, which Reebok does easily. But this time, between the furnace problem and his panic about the 8:00 meeting, Joe forgot. The dog has no food and maybe even no water, and no way to get any until tomorrow evening, when Joe returns from his trip. Maybe I can call someone to help out, Joe thinks despe rately. But no. He is between girlfriends at present, and so no one has a key to his house. The imposs ibility of his situation begins to dawn on him, and he grips the steering wheel even harder. He absolutely must make this _ meeting, and he can be there on time if he just keeps going. But what about Reebok? He will not starve to death in a day and a half, Joe knows , but he will be miserable-and the water-how long does it take an animal to die of dehydration? Joe has no idea. Still driving as fast as the traffic will bear, he tries to think about his options. The available choices tumble over one another in a rush. He can attend the 8:00 meeting and then go home and feed the dog, but that will make him miss his 10: 15 flight , and the trip is even more important than the meeting.

For exam ple, perhaps Joe simply cannot stomach the thought of returning from his New Yo rk trip to find a Labrador retriever dehydrated and dead on his kitchen floor. Not knowing how long a dog can survive without water, he is unwilling to take the risk, but his aversion to the horrifying scenario is noyxactly conscien ce.

I>' _ Or maybe Joe is motiv ated by what the neighbors will think if they hear Reebok howling in hunger, or, worse, if they learn the dog has died, alone and trapped, while Joe was on a business trip. How will he ever explain himself to his friends and acquaintan ces? This worry is not really Joe's conscience, either, but rather his anticipation of serious embarrassment and social re jection. If this is why Joe goes back home to feed his dog, he is hardly the first human being to make a decision based on the dread of what others will think of him, rather than on what he might do if he were sure his actions would remain a complete secret. The opinions of other people keep us all in line, arguably better than anyth ing else. Or maybe this is all a matter of the way Joe sees himself. Perhaps Joe does not want to view himself, in his own mind's eye, as the kind of wretch who would commit animal abuse, and his self-image as a decent person is crucial enough to him that, when he has no other altern ative, he will forgo an important meeting in the service of pre­ serving that image . This is an especially plausible explanation for Joe's behavior. The preser vation of self-image is a motivator of some notoriety .

This would be laudable and very human -but it is not conscience. The intriguing truth of the matter is that much of what we do that looks like conscience is motivated by some other thing alto­ gether-f ear, social pressure, pride, even simple habit. And where Joe is concerne d, a number of readers will strongly favor an expla­ nation other than conscience because some of his behaviors are al­ ready questionable. He routinely leaves his young dog alone for many hours at a time, sometimes for nearly two days.

And on account of this attachment , 1 believe that when Joe gave up his morning plan and went home to take care of his dog, he may possibly have been acting out of conscience. If we could give Joe a truth serum and ask him what was going on inside him at the moment he decided to turn the car around, and he were to say some­ thing like, \"I just couldn't stand it that Reebok was going to be there hungry and thirsty all that time,\" then 1 would be reasonably con­ vinced that Joe was conscience-dr iven in this situation. 1 would be basing my evaluation of Joe on the psy chology of con­ science itself.

The History of Conscience Not everyone has a conscien ce, this intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments to others. Some people will never experience the exquisite angst that results from letting others down, or hurting them, or depriving them, or even killing them. If the first five senses are the physical ones-sight , hearing, tou�h, smell, taste-and the \"sixth sense\" is how we refer to our intuition, then conscience can be numbered seventh at best.

Could the powerful political leader of a whole nation of people have a con­ science? Certainl y. Or, contrastin gly, could any of these people be utterly without con'science? The answer is once again, unnervingl y, yes . . ' The anonymity of \"evil\" and its maddening ref usal to attach itself 'reliably to any particular societal role, racial group, or physical type has always p lagued theologians and, more rece ntly, scientists . Throughout human history, we have tried mightily to pin down \"good\" and \"evil,\" and to find some way to account for those in our midst who would seem, to be inhabited by tne latter. In the fourth century, the Christian scholar Saint Jerome introduced the Greek word synderesis to describe the innate God-given ability to sense the difference betwe en good and evil. He interpreted Ezekiel's biblical . vision of four living creatures emerging from a cloud \"with brightness round about it, and fire flashing forth continuall y.\" Each creature had the body of a man, but each had four different faces. The face in front was human, the face on the right was that of a lion, the left face was that of an ox, and the face in back was an eagle's . In Jerome's in terpretation of Ezekiel's dream, the human face repre­ sented the rational part of man, the lion reflected the emotions, the ox symbolized the appetite s, and the lofty eagle was \"that spark of conscience which was not quenched even in the heart of Cain ... that makes us, too, feel our sinfulness when we are overcome by evil Desire or unbridled Spirit .. , . And yet in some men we see this con­ science overthrown and displaced; they have no sense of guilt or shame for their sins.\" Jerome's illustrious contempor ary, Augustine of Hippo, agreed with Jerome concerning the nature of conscience . Augustine assured his followers that \"men see the moral rules written in the book of light which is called Truth from which all laws are copied.\" But a conspicuous problem remain ed. Since the Truth-the ab­ solute knowle dge of good and evil-is given by God to all human be- - 27 --"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT ings, why are all human beings not good? Why do we \"see this con­ science overthrown and displaced\" in some people? And this ques­ tion remained at the center of the theological discussion about conscience for many centuries. Despi te the sticky wicket , the alter­ native suggestio n-the proposal that only some people had con­ science-was impossible to make, because it would have meant that by withholding the Truth from a few of His servants, God Himself had created evil in the world and had distributed it, in seeming ran­ domness, among all the types and enterprises of humanity. Asolution to,the theological dilemma over conscience seemed to come in the thirteenth century, when Thomas Aquinas proposed a roundabout distinction betwe en synderesis, Saint Jerome's infallible God-g iven knowl edge of right and wrong, and conscientia, which was comprised of mistake-prone human reason as it struggle d to reach decisions about behavior. To make its choices . concerning which ac­ tions to take, Reason was supplied with perfect inf ormation from God, but Reason itself was rather weak. In this system, fallible hu­ man decision making, not a lack of conscience, is to blame for wrong decisions and actions. Doing wrong is simply making a mistake . In contrast , according to Aquinas, \"Synderesis cannot err; it provides principles which do not vary, just as the laws that govern the physi­ cal unive rse do not vary. \" To apply this view to our contemporary example-w hen Joe re­ members that his dog is without food and water, God- given innate synderesis (conscien ce) immediately informs . him that the absolute right action is to return home and take care of the dog. Conscientia, a mental debate about how to behave , then takes this Truth into con­ sideration. The fact that Joe does not tum the car around instanta- ' neously but, instead, spends a few minutes deliber ating is the result of the natural weakne ss of human reason. That Joe does make the right decision in the end means, in Aquinas's scheme, that Joe's ' . moral virtue s are, through strengt hened Reason, developing in the right direction. Had Joe decided to let the dog go hungry and thirsty , , - 28 - o j '"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR his thereby weakene d Reason would have been directing his moral virtue s to Hell, theologically speaking. Getting down to theology's brass tacks , according to the early church fathers, (1) the rules of morality are absolute; (2) all people innately lmow the absolute Truth; and (3) bad behavior is the result of faulty thinking, rather than a lack of synderesis, or conscien ce, and since we all have a conscience , if only human reason were perfect, there would be no bad behavior. And indeed, these are the three be­ liefs l about conscience that have been held by much of the world throughout most of modem history. Their influence on the way we think about ourselves and other people, even today, is inestimable. The third belief is especial ly hard to let go of. Nearly a millennium after Aquinas made his pronouncement about synderesis, when someone consisten tly behaves in ways we find unconscionable, we . call on an updated version of the \"weak Reason\" paradigm. We spec­ ulate that the offender has been depriv ed, or that his mind is dis­ turbed, or that his early background makes him do it. We remain extremely reluctant to propose the more straightforward explanation that either God or nature simply failed to provide him with a con­ science. For several hundred years, discussions about conscience tended to center around the relationship between human reason and di­ vinely given moral know ledge. A few corollary debates were added, . most recen tly the one over proportionalism, a divine loophole wherein Reason asks us to do something \"bad\" in order to bring about some- thing else that is \"good\"-a \"just war,\" for example . But at the beginning of the twentieth century, conscience itself underwent a fundamental transforma tion, due to . the growing ac­ ceptance in Europe and the United States of the theories of physi­ cian/scientist (and atheist) Sigmund Freud. Freud proposed that in the normal course of development, young children's minds acquired an internalized authority figure , called a superego, that would in time replace the actual external autho rity-the actual external authority - 29 -"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT being not God but one's . own human parents. With his \"disco very\" of the superego, Freud effectively wrested conscience out of the hands . ' of God and placed it in the anxious clutches of the all-too-human family. This change of address for conscience required some datlnt- . ing shifts in our centu ries-old worldview. Suddenl y, our moral guides had feet of clay, and absolute Truth began to submit to ,the uncer­ tainties of cultural relati vism. , \" '. Freud's new structural model of the mind did not involve a hu- man part, a lion part, an ox part, and an eagle. Tr ipartite instead, his vision was of the superego, the ego, and the id. The id was composed of all the sexual and unthinking aggressi ve instincts we are born with, along with the biological appetite s. As such, the id was often in conflict with the demands of a civilized society. In t � ntra st, the ego was the rational, aware part of the mind. It could think logica lly, make plans, and remember, and because the ego was equipped in these ways, it could interact . directly with society and, to varying de- . grees, get things done for the more primitive id. The supereg o grew out of the ego as the child incorporated the external rules of his or her parents and of society. The supereg o eventually became a free- . standing force in the developing mind, unilaterally judging and di­ recting the child's behaviors and thoughts . It was the commanding, guilt-brandishing inner voice that said no, even when nobody was around. The basic concept of super ego makes common sense to us. We ' often observe children internalizing and even enforcing their par­ ents' rules. (Mother frowns and says, to her four-year-old daughter; �'No shouting in the car.\" A few minute s later, the same four-ye ar-old points imperiously at her noisy two-year-old sister and shouts, \"No shouting in the carl\") And most of us, as adults, have heard our own supereg o. Some of us hear it quite often,in fact. It is the voice in our heads that says to us, Idiot! Why'd you do that? or You know, if y(!)u don't finish this report t<;might, you'll be sorry, or You'd better get your cholesterol checke d.

A dog is a tremendous responsibi lity. When you have a dog, you always have to interrupt what you're doing and take care of it.\" Joe's adult decision to turn his car around could well have been directed by his superego, which insisted that he fulfill this very dictum. In a more abstruse manner, Freud himself might have wondered whethe r Joe's superego had caused Joe to set up his whole morning, unconsciously of course-being in too much of a hurry, forgetting to put out the dog food-such that his father's rule could be \"prov ed,\" and Joe \"punished\" for getting a pet.

From this point on, should any sexual fe elings arise toward the parent of the opposite sex, or any rivalrous feelings toward the par\" ent of the same sex, these feelings will be vanqu ished by the dreaded, ruthless w.eapon of the newly fortified supereg o-immedi­ ate, unbearable guilt. In this way, the superego gains its autonomy and its crown ing advantage inside the mind of the child. It is a se� vere taskmaster . installed to serve our need to remain a part of the . gtoUp. Whatever else one may think of such theorizing, credit must be given to Freud for understanding that our moral sense was not a one-s ize-fits�all hermetic code, but was instead dynamic, and intti- . cately tied up with essential family and societal bonds. With his writ� , ings on the superego, Freud imparted to an awake ning scientific \" world that our usual respect for law and order was not simply im- \" posed on us from the outs ide. We obey the rules, we honor the ' virtue s, primarily from an internal need that begins in infancy al'ld early childhood to preserve and remain embraced by our families and the larger human society in which we live . : Conscience Versus Superego Whether or not one believes that superego is an intrapsYchk schemer, or that it is, to use Freud's words , \"the heir to the Oedipus complex ,\" superego itself must be acknow ledged as a rich and useflill . concept.

And some people's superegos are rather more insulting than others. Still, superego is not the same thing as conscience. It may feel like conscience sub jectively, and may be one small part of what con­ science is, but superego by itself is not conscience. This is because Freud, as he tonceptu alized the superego, threw out the baby with the bathwater, in a manner of speaking. In ejecting moral absolutism from psychological thought , he counte d out something else too. Quite simpl y, Freud counted out love, and all of the emotions re­ lated to love. Though he often stated that children love their parents in addition to fearing them, the superego he Wf?te about 'Yas en � j:�rely fe�r-b��� _d. In his view, just as ';'e fear our parents' stem criti­ cisms when we are children, so do we fear the excoriating voice of superego later on. And fear is all.

There was always someone, usually an older girl, who was willing to succumb to Skip's flattery and his charming smile. Often the girl would sneak him into her room, but sometimes he and a girl would simply find a secluded spot · on a playground or under the bleachers at the softball field . As for his grade s, he really was ex­ tremely smart-he could have made straight A-plusses -but get­ ting C's was completely effortless, and so that was what he did. Occasionall y, he would even get a E, which amused him, since he ne,:,er studie d. The teachers liked him, seemed to,be almost as vul­ nerable to his smiles and his compliments as the girls were, and everyone assumed that young Skipper would end up at a good high school and then a decent co�lege, despi te his grades. His parents had a great deal of money, were \"megarkh ,\" as the other kids put it. On several occasions when he was about twelve , Skip sat at the antique rolltop desk his parents had bought for his bedroom, trying to calculate how much money he would get when they died. He based his calculations on some financial records he had stolen from his father's study. The records were conf using and incomple te, but even though he could not arrive at an exact figure, Skip could see clearly that someday he would be quite rich. . Still, Skip had a problem. He was bored most of the time. The am�sements he pursued, even the girls, eve� fooling the teachers, even thinking about his money, did not keep him energized for longer than half an hour or so. The family wealth held the most promise as an enterta inment, but it was not under his control yet­ he was still a child. No, the only real relief from boredom was the fun he could have in Virginia . Vacations Were a very good time. That first summer, when he was eight, he had simply stabbed the bullfrogs with a scissors, for want of anothe r method.

He could spend hours at a time killing them, and still it looked as if there were hundreds and hundreds of them left for tomo rrow. But by the end of that first summer, Skip had decided that he could do better. He was tired of stabbing the frogs. It would pe so great to blow them up, to have something that would make the fat little squirmers explode, and toward this end he had a really good plan. He knew plen t y of older boys back home , and one in particular he knew took a fa mily trip to South Carolina during spring break every April. Skip had heard that fireworks were for sale and easy to get in South Carolina. With a lit­ tle bribe from Skip, his friend Tim would buy him some fireworks there and smuggle them home in the bottom of his suitcase. Tim would be scared to do it, but with a pep talk fr om Skip, and enough money, he would. Next summer, Skip would have not scissors but fireworks ! Finding cash around the house was no problem, and the plan worked like a chaJ;'tn. That April, he came up with two hundred dol­ lars for a fireworks variety pack called \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" which he had seen in a gun magazine, and anothe r one hundred dollars to sweeten the deal for Tim. And when Skip finally got his hands on the package, it was a beautiful thing. He had chosen \"Star-Spangled Banner\" because it contained the largest number of devices small enough to fit, or almost fit, into the mouth of a bullfrog. There was a supply of tiny Roman candles; and some \"Lady Fingers,\" which were slim little red firecracke rs; and a bunch of one-inch shells called \"Wizards \"; and his favorite, some two-inch shells in a box labeled \"Mortal Destruct ion,\" which had a skull and crossbones blazoned on the front. - 38 -"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR That summer, he shoved the devices, one by one, into the mouths of the captured frogs, ignited them, and threw the frogs high into the air over the lake. Or sometimes he would put the ignited frog down , run off, and watch from a distance as the animal ex­ ploded on the ground . The displays were. magnificen t-blood, goo, lights , sometimes a big noise and those colorful flowerlike shapes. So wonderful were the results that soon he began to crave an audience for his genius. One afternoon, he enticed his six-ye ar-old sister, Claire, down to the lake , let her help him capture one of the frogs, and then before her eyes, made an airborne explosion of it. Claire screamed hysterica lly and ran as fast as her legs would carry her back to the house. The family's stately \"cottage\" sat about half a mile from the lake, beyond a serene stand of hundred-foot hemlocks. This was not so far away that Skip's parents had not heard explosi ve noises, and they imagined that Skipper must be setting off fireworks by the lake. But they had long since realized that he was not the sort of child who could be contr olled, and that they needed to choose their battles very carefully. The fireworks issue was not one they chose to deal with, not even when six-year-old Claire came running in to tell her mother that Skipper was blowing up frogs.

Amoral and uncaring, does he end up isolated on the edges of society? Does he constan tly threaten and snarl and quite possibly drool, devoid as he is of such a fundamental human characteristic? One might easily imagine that Skip· grew up to be a killer. In the end, perhaps he murdered his par­ ents for their money. Maybe he wound up dead himself, or in the bowels of a maximum-security prison. Sounds likely, but nothing of the kind actually happened. Skip is still alive, he . has never killed any­ one, not directly at least, and-so far-he has not seen the inside of any prison. To the contrary , though he has not yet inherited his par­ ents' mOney, he has become successf ul and richer than a king.

How could this possibly be? Did he have a reco very? Did he get better? No. In truth, he got worse. He became Super Skip. With passing, if not stellar, grades, his charm, and his fa mily's in­ fluence, Skip did indeed get into that good boarding school in Massachusetts , and his family breathed a sigh of relief, both for his acceptance by the school and for his relative absence from their lives. His teachers still found him charismatic, but his mothe r and si�ter had learned that he was manipula tive and spooky .

When he was twenty- six, he joined the Arika Corporation, a company that made blasting, drilling, and loading equipment for metal-ore mines. He had intense blue eyes and a stunning smile at all the right moments, and to his new employers he seemed almost magica lly talented at motivating sales represen tatives and influenc­ ing contac ts. For his part, Skip had discovered that manipulating ed­ ucated adults was no hard e r than it had been to convince his young friend Tim to buy fireworks in South Carolina, and of course lying, in increasing ly elegant ways, came as easily as breathing. Even bet­ ter, chronically bored Skip relished the pressures of fast-track risk taking and was more than willing to take the big chances that no one else would. Before his third anniv ersary at the compan y, he had gone after the copper in Chile and the gold in South Africa, eventually making Arika into the world's third-largest vendor of both shaf t and open-pit mining equipment.

By this time, he and Juliette had two little girls, completing his public dis­ guise as a family man. His contributions to the business came with a certain price, but nothing that could not be handled i� a cost­ efficient manner. Employees sometimes complained that he was \"in­ suIting\" or \"vicious ,\" and Arika was sued when a secretary claimed he had broken her arm while trying to force her to sit in his lap. The case was settled .out of court with fifty thousand dollars and a gag or­ der for the secretary . Fifty thousand dollars was nothing to the com­ pany, relatively speaking. He was \"Super Skip,\" and his employer understood that he was well worth the upkeep. Of the incident, Skip later remarked privatel y, \"She's insane . She broke her own arm. She struggle d with me, the stupid bitch.

In fact, he is rich and, in many circles, respected-or at least feared, which masquerades brillian tly as respect. So what-is wrong with this picture? Or perhaps the ques- , tion should be: What is the worst part of this picture, the central flaw in Skip's life that makes him into a tragedy despi te his success, and into the maker of tragedies for so many others? It is this: Skip has no emotional attachments to other people, none at all. He is cold as ice. His mothe r is there to be ignore d, or sometimes baited. His sis­ ter is there to be' tormente d. Other women are sexual plunder and nothing more. He has been waiting since childhood for his fa ther to do only one thing-to die and leave his money to Skip.

Robert Hare writes, \"Many people find it difficult to deal with the intense, emotion less, or 'predatory' stare of the psychopath ,\" and for some of the more sensitive people in his life, Skip's intense blue eye�, the ones his sister sees as \"weird ,\" may well be those of the dispas­ sionate hunter gazing at his psychological prey.

He was not inte rested in possessing the stamps, or in selling them for cash. His only ambition was to execute a simple break-in at night and then find a spot a little distance from the post office he had just robbe d, where he could watch the frenzy of the first employees to enter the building in the morning, followe d by the eme rgency arrival of the police.

In the study, two men, strangers to each other, arrive at a psychology laboratory to participate in an experiment that has been advertised as having to do with memory and learning. Participation is rewarded with four dollars, plus fifty cents for carfare.

The other person is told that he is to be the \"teacher\" in this learning experiment . After the teacher has watched the learner get strapped to a chair and wired for electric shock, the teacher is taken into a different room and asked to take a seat in fr ont of a large, omi­ nous machine called a \"shock generator. \" The shock generator has thirty switches, arranged horizontally and labeled by \"volts ,\" from 15 volts all the way to 450 volts, in IS-volt increments . In addition to the numbers, the swi tches are branded with descriptors that range from SLIGHT SHOCK to the sinister appellation of DANGER---' SEVERE SHOCK.

When the learner gets an answer right-for example, teacher calls out \"blue,\" and learner answers \"box\"-the teacher can move on to the next test item. But when the learner gives an incorrect answer, the teacher must push a switch and give him an electric shock. The experimenter instructs the teacher to begin at the lowest level of shock on the shock generator, and with each wrong answer, to increase the shock level by one increment. The le�rner in the other room is actually the experimenter's trained confederate, an actor, and will receive no shocks at all. But of course the teacher does not know this, and it is the teacher who is the real subject of the experiment. The teacher calls out the first few items of the \"learning tes t,\" and then trouble begins, because the learner -Milgram's accomplice, unseen in the other room-starts to sound very uncomfor table.

So please go on.\" Milgram repeated this procedure forty times using forty different , subjects- people who were \"in everyday life responsible and de­ cent\"-including high school teachers, postal clerks, salesmen, manual laborers , and engineers. The forty represented various edu­ cational levels, from one man who had not finished high school to others who had doctoral or other professional degrees. The aim of the experiment was to discover how long the subjects (the teachers in this experiment) would take to disobey Milgram's authority when presented with a' clear moral imperative . How much electric shock would they administer to a pleading, screaming stranger merel y be­ qmse an authority figure told them to do so?

He wrote of many World War II incidents in which almost all soldiers obeyed and fired their weapons while their leaders were present to command them, but when the leader s left, the firing rate dropped immed iately to between 15 and 20 percent. Marshall believed that the great re­ lief disp layed by soldiers in a sector where they were not being di­ rectly ordered to fire \"was due not so much to the realization that things were safer there as to the blessed knowle dge that for a time they were not un d er t h e compu l sion to ta k e l i f e. \" In his book On Ki ll ing: T h e Psyc h o l ogica l C ost o f Learning to Ki ll in Wa r an d S ociet y, former u.s. Army Ranger and paratrooper Lt. CoL Dave Grossman reviews Marshall's observations, along with the FBI's studies of nonfiring rates among law-enf orcement officers in the 1950s and 1960s, and observations of nonfiring from a long list of wars, including the American Civil. War, World Wars I and II, the Vietnam War, and the Falklands War. He concludes that \"the vast majority of combatants throughout history , at the moment of truth when they could and should kill the enem y, have found themselves to be 'conscientious objecto rs.' \" Mter weighing the considerable historical evidence that ground soldiers often resist and quietly sab­ otage opportunities to kill, Grossman comes to a \"novel and reas­ suring conclusion about the nature of man: despi te an unbroken . . � tradition of violence and war, man is not by nature a killer.\" To suf3 ,l � \" vert the bottom line of conscience, to be able to thrust a bayonet or pull a trigger to kill a stranger, normal human beings must be care­ fully taught, psychologically conditioned, and commanded by au­ thorities on the battlefie ld. Also, it helps to encourage moral exclus ion, to remind the troops that the enemy soldiers are nothing but its, Krauts , slants, gooks. As Peter Watson writes in Wa r on t h e Min d : Th e Mi l itary Uses an d A b uses o f Psyc h o l ogy, \"the stupidity of local customs is ridicu led,\" and \"local pe.rsop.alities ate presented as evil demigods . \" On and off the battlefield, for both the troops and the people 66"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":", THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOO,R back home, the particular war being fought must be portrayed as a , . crucial or even a sacred struggle betwe en good and eV il, which is. ex­ , actly the message that authori ties-on all sides of the conflic t-have . tried to convey during every major war in history . For examp le, , ' though it is now difficult to remember anything but the moral out- , . rage that exploded during the final phases of the. Vietnam War, as ' that war began, Americans were repeatedly assured that they and only they could save the South Vietnamese people from a future of terror and enslavement . Speeches by leader s during wartime , in modem times broadcasted into our living rooms, have always pushed hard o� this theme of an absolutely necessary mission, the high call­ ing that justifies the killing. And paradoxica lly, authority can more \" readily project this take on reality for the very reason that conscience ,,' ' cherishes a high calling and a sense of membership in the right­ minded group. In other words, conscience can be tricked, and when . it comes to killing strange rs, trickery is usually requir ed. That psychology can provide the military with techniques to make killers out of nonkillers, and that the military is , using these procedures, is dispiriting news. But behind the bad news is a parti­ cle of hope that glints like a diamond in a sea of darkness. We are beginning to learn that human beings are not the natural killing ma­ chines we have at times believed ourselves to be. Even under the \" desper ate pressures of combat, we have often left our weapons un- fired, or taken poor aim, for when it was not silenced under the bell jar of authori ty, there was always an outcry from our human con­ nectedness-there has always been the voice of conscien ce-re­ minding us that we must not kill. Because its essence is killing, war is the ultimate contest between conscience and authori ty. Our seventh sense , demands that we not take life, and when authority overrules conscience and a soldier is in­ duced to kill in combat, he is very likely to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder immediately and for the remainder of his life, along with the depression, divorces, addictions, ulcers, and heart disease � 67 -"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MART HA STOUT that attend traumatic memory. In contrast, research involving Vietnam vet erans has shown that soldiers who are not placed in sit­ uations where they are forced to kill are no more likely to develop the symptoms of PTSD than are those who spend their entire en­ listment at home . This crippling competition between our moral sense and our au­ thority figures has gone on almost unceas ingly since human beings began to live in hierarchical societie s, for the past five thousand years during which a -king or a land-hung ry nobleman, or the leader of a state or a nation could order less powerful individ uals to enter a battle and kill. And appare ntly it is a struggle of conscience that will not be resolved in our children's or our grandchildren's lifetimes. Obedience 6, Conscience 4 Stanley Milgram, who demonstrate d that at least six out of ten peo­ ple will tend to obey to the bitter end an of ficial-looking authority who is physically present, pointed out that people who disobey de­ structive authority suffer psychologica lly, too. Often a person who disobe ys finds himself at odds with the social order, and may fit;td it hard to shake the feeling that he has been faithless to someone or something to whom he pledged allegian ce. Obedience is passive, and it is only the disobedien t one who must bear the \"burden of his action,\" to use Milgram's words. If courage is acting according to , one's conscience despite pain or fe ar, then strength is the ability to keep conscience awake and in force despi te the demands of author­ ities to do otherwise. And strength is important , because in championing the various causes of conscience , the odds are against us.

This leaves thirty-six people who have both conscience and the strength to bear the burdens of their actions, a '\\ little more than a third of the group. These are not impossible odds, but they are not easy ones, either. And there is yet another challenge for the conscience-bound, . which is that , strange as it seems, most of the sociopaths are invisi­ ble.

But first, let us return to the hospital once more, this time -- to see Dr. Jackie Rubenstein's miracle, two miracles in fact. It is now four days after Dennis was boarded to a locked unit, it Sunday, and the hospital grounds are empty except fof ' a small · car that travels up the narrow drive to Dennis's building and stops by the front door. Dr. Rubenstein steps out and digs in her coat pocket for the tremendous, almost medieval master key that will let her both in and out of the three-story stone building. Even now, after eight years of work at the hospital, she clutche s the heavy passkey in her hand, . rather than putting it back in her pocket, after she enters a unit like this one and hears the door lock behind her. She has come to try, one more time, to get her terrified patient Dennis to talk to her: When . she walks onto the ward itself-and yet another metal door closes behind her and locks-she sees Dennis sitting on a green vinyl sofa and staring at a television that has not been turned on. He looks up, their eyes meet for a moment, and, to her surprise and relief', he mo­ tions for her to come and sit down . Then the first miracle happens: Dennis talks. He talks and he I talks, and he tells Jackie Rubenstein everything Doreen Littlefield said. And the second miracle is that Jackie believes him. Ftom home that night , she phones Doreen and confronts her. Doreen denies everything, and disdainfully accuses her of being drawn into her patient's paranoia. When Jackie refuses to back down , Doreen Warns her that she will be damaging her own career if she goes to anyone else at the hospital with such a wild tale. When she hangs up the phone after talking with Doreen, Jackie calls a good friend back in Los Angeles for support. She tells him, only half kidding, that she thinks she may be losing her mind. Jackie does not know that Doreen is a fraud, and so from Jackie's perspec tiv e , she and Doreen are peers at the hospital. For this rea­ son, Jackie realizes that she will have a hard time pressing her point with the more senior staff. They will assume this is just some kind of dispute between her and Jackie.

Gaslight Being targeted by a sociopath is a very frightening experience, even when that sociopath is not of the violent variety. In 1944, George Cukor directed a psychological thriller entitled Gaslight, in which a beautiful young woman, played by Ingrid Bergman, is made to feel she is going insane . Her fear that she is losing her mind is inflicted on her systematically by Charles Boyer, who plays her evil but charming new husband. Among a number of other dirty tricks , Boyer arranges for Bergman to hear sounds in the attic when he is absent, and for the gaslight to dim by itself, in a menacing house where her aunt was mysteriously murdered years before . Of course, no one believes Bergman about the noises in the attic or the gaslight or much of anything else, and her graduql , .. descen t into doubting her own reality has found . its way into English idiom as \"to be gaslighte d.\" Boyer is not violent . He;: never strikes Bergman. Much more sinister-he causes her to lose faith in her own perceptjons .

At forty-five , she had dirty blond hair that was turning gray and a round motherly body that had never been glamor ous. But she owned a fine intellect and a long list of academic and professional accomplishments. At a university in her home state of Florida, she had been promoted to an associate professorship in epidemiology before she was thirty . She studied the population effects of substances used in indigenous medicines, and before her marriage she had traveled extensively in Malaysia, South America, and the Caribbean. When she move d from Florida to Massachusetts, she became a consultant to an ethnopharmacology group based in Cambridge. But I liked her most for her gentle de­ meanor and the thoughtf ul, introspe ctive approach she took to her life. One of the things I remember best about her was the soft warmth of her speaking voice during the brief fifteen therapy ses­ sions we had together. Sydney was divorced from a man named Luke. The divorce had drained her life savings and caused her to go into debt, because she had needed to make sure she got custody of her son, Jonathan, who was eight when I knew Sydney, and only five at the time of the di­ vorce. Luke had put up an expensi ve struggle , not because he loved Jonathan, but because he was enraged with Sydney for making him move out of her house. The house in South Florida had a swimming pool.

Is he quite all right, ma'am?\" -the sitter cautiously asked Sydney. Using a variant of the excuse Luke had provided, an embarrassed Sydney told her, \"He's going through a hard time in his life right now.

He used his wife's dearest and most private dreams to manipulate her, and their son was an aggravation he moodily tolerated only be­ cause the baby seemed to seal her acceptance of his presence. Otherw ise, he ignored his own child. Soon he began to ignore Sydney as well. \"It was kind of like having a boarder, a boarder you don't like very I . much and who doesn't pay rent.

I'm ashamed to tell you this, but I slept in my own guest room for a year.\" Overall, the greatest difficul ty Sydney had in telling me her story was her painful embarrassment about what had happened to her life; . As she put it, \"You can't imagine how humiliating it is to admit, even just to admit to yourself, that you actually married somebody like that. And I wasn't a kid when I did it, either.

He did not go about cutting throats , either literally or figurative ly, in an attempt to achie ve power or wealth . He was no corporate shark, and certainly no fast-t alking, high-octane Skip. He did not have enough vitality even to be an or­ dinary con man, or enough physical courage to rob -banks (or post offices). He was not a mover, He was, in effect, a nonmover.

We have already discussed what causes sociopa thy, and so it is only fa ir to address the twin question: What causes conscience? From a certain point of view, this inquiry is not merely parallel; it is actually the better and more baffling question. Since Darwin pub­ lished The Origin of Species, in 1859, much of scien tific theorizing has considered that all living things, including human beings, have evolved according to the law of natural selection. According to this law, known more popularly as \"the law of the jungle ,\" any character­ istic that enhances survival and reproduction (and therefore the con­ tinuance of its own genetic components ) will tend to remain in the - 16 4 -"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE SOC,lOPATH NEXT' DOO.R . population. If a phys ical trait ' or a behavioral tendency bestows this fe licitous survival advantage on individuals for countless generations, in many situations and across habitats, it may, incremen tally and in the course of time immemorial, become part of the standard genetic blueprint for the species. According to the law of natural selection, tigers have claws , chameleons change colors, rats avo id open spaces, possums play dead, and apes have big brains because tigers with claws , camou­ flaged lizards, secreti ve rodents, play acting possums, and very smart . primates tend to survive longer and so make more babies than their peers do. In turn, these babies su rvive better and reproduce more of ten than their less - fo rtunate playmates who are not ge­ netica lly endo wed with natural weapons, camouflage techniques, su rviva l-promoting anxi ety, theatrical abili ty, or superior inte lligence. But according to this utterly amoral law of the jungle, of what possible use to the individual members of a predatory specie s-for human be ings are technically predators-are the limitations and in­ terruptions of a powerful moral sen .se? Imagine , for example, a great white shark with a demanding conscience. How long would she live ? What , then, can concei vably be the evolutionary origins of human conscience? Let us put this eitraordinary questiori another way. Picture peo­ ple stranded on a small, remote island with limited resour ces. In the long run, �hat kind of individual is more likely to survive�an hon­ est, moral person, or someone ruth less like Skip? The kind and empathic Jac kie , Rubenste in, or Doreen Lit tlefield?

If there were a few others on the island for the survivors to make ba­ bies with-and given that socio pathy is at least partially genetical ly determined -over a great many generations, might we not end up with an island populated mainly by people who possessed no con ' ­ science?

And if, to the contrary , people with conscience were still to be fo und on the island, wh �r � lif e was fr agile and ruthle ssness paid off, what in the natural world could possibly have been fo ster­ ing their moral sense? Precisel y on account of this seemi ngly imposs ible challenge to ev olutionary theory, natur alists, sociobiologists, comparative psy­ chologists, and philosophers have long been interested in the origins of unselfishness in humans and in other animals. Whenever we care­ fu lly observe the actions of the so-called higher animals, we see an apparen tly irreconcilable dichotomy betw een selfish surviv alism and intense social intere st. And of course, nowhere is this dichotomy more ext reme than in the human species. We compete feroc iousl y, and we teach our children to compete . We finance wars and weapons of mass destruc tion. And we also fund fo undations, social welfare program s, and homeless shelters, and try to teach our children­ those very same children-to be kind. Our species has produced both a Napoleon and a Mother Te resa. But according to fu ndamentalist ev olutionary theory , Mother Te resa should never have been born, because neither charity nor a sense of good and evil would seem to have ahyth ing at all to do with the law of the jungle. So what is going on here? As David Papineau asked in his New Yo r k Times review of Matt Ridley's book Th e Origins o f Virt ue, \"If nice guys always finished last when our ancestors were scrabbling around for fo od on the Mr ican savanna, why does moral­ ity come so naturally to us now? \" And humans are hardly the only animals who can be unselfish.

Group selection, and all it implies about our true nature , has ' been an extremely controv ersial idea among evolu tionists, reflecting the fact that the theory of evolution itself is still evol ving. Early the­ ories of group selection assumed the possi bility that, in the be­ ginning, there had been cohesi ve gro up� of altr uistic individuals (m ammals that emitted warning behaviors , birds that would signal fo od to the flock, primates who were genero us, and so fo rth) for group selection to favor in the first place. This poorly explained as­ sumption-aggregations of altruists fro m the clear blue sky-was ir­ ritating to many scholars, who bestowed on it the damning label of weak science. In 1966, George C. Williams of the University of Chicago pub­ lished a now- classic text entitled A d aptation an d Natura l S e l ection, in 167"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT which he argued that although group selection was theoretically pos­ sible , it was unlikely to occur in nature. Williams wrote that neither the group nor the individual was the fu ndamental unit of natural se­ lection, maintaining that the true unit of selection was the gene it­ self. For creatures that reproduce sexua lly, as opposed to organisms that generate clones, the ' gene is the only unit that self-replicates ex­ actly (m ore or l� ss) through time. Children are not exact copies of their parents, but genes are fairly precise replicas of themselves. And so, William!, insisted, the gene must be the only unit that natural se� lection can effic ien tly use. In other words, \"s urvival of the fitte st\" meant survival of the fitte st genes (o r rather, the information coded in them ), not necessar ily the survival of the fitte st individual animals or groups. For Wi lliams , individuals and groups were there only to serve as temporary environments fo r genetic inf ormation. \\ And ten years later, in 1976, in a still-popular book called Th e S e l fi s h Gene, Richard Dawkins extended Williams's gene-centered theory and biologist W. D. Hamilton's notion of k in se l ection, which paradoxical ly reexplains the evolution of unselfish behaviors at the level of the individual by inv oking the idea of \"selfishness\" at the leve l of the gene. This is a rather strange notion, and deser ves some ex­ planation. Kin selection means that pieces of the individual's genetic blue­ print (the only biological aspect of the individual that stands a chance of being \"immort al, \" so to speak) will fare better if the indi­ vidual guards not only his own survival and reproduction odds but also those of other individuals who share some of his genetic makeup. If he behaves generously and protecti vely toward his blood relativ es, their enhanced sur vival and reproduction rate will increase the numbers of his own genes in fu ture generations, since his rela­ tives and he have many genes in common. Of cour se , the expression \"selfish gene\" is not intended to imply that DNA is a thinking, fe eling thing with its own desires. Dawkins uses \"selfish gene\" as 'a metaphor. He means that ,the characteristics - 168 -"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR of a species are determined by genes that cause individuals to think, fe el, and behave in ways that maximize the existence of those same genes in the gene pool, regardless of the effects of those thoughts , , fe elings, and behaviors on the individuals themselv es.

As in the fa mous quota tion by Samuel Butler, \"A chicken is an egg's way of making another eg g.\" According to many evolu tionists , because we share the greatest percentage of our genetic complement with our parents, our sib­ lings, and our children, kin selection accounts fo r the fact that we tend to be more selfless toward our parents, siblings, and children than towa r d more distant relatives and strang ers. Furthermore , kin . selection explains why we nurture and protect our children despi te the fact that doing so lessens our own energies and our individual survival resources.

These behaviors would be mediated by emotions ,such as grati tude, compassion, and con­ science , and so emotions such as these would have had an advantage where the natural selection of genes was concern ed. But in a revival of the idea of group selection, other evolutionary theorists, among them David Sloan Wi lson and Stephen Jay Gould, have implored both the biological and the behavioral sciences to consider that evolu tion may in fact have taken place on more levels than just the gene-centered one. Naturalist Gould reexamines the evidence from paleontology and maintains that natural selection op­ erates on ..multiple lev els, from the gene to the individual to the group, and even-or especia lly-t he species. In addition, he makes the case that fo rces operating in a much less incremental fa shion than natural selection, and fa r more rapidly than time immemorial­ events that include global or near-global catastrophe s-:-have signifi­ cantly affected the course of evolution and may do so again. The various leve ls of natural selec tion are likely at odds with one another, particular ly with respect to altru istic behaviors and emo­ tions such as conscience. At the level of the gene and also at the level of the group, conscience is ada ptive , and natural selection would fa­ vor it.

That is what the words 'selfish' and 'unselfish ,' 'moral' and 'immoral' are all about in everyday language .\" What Wi lson describes in fhis way is the same bewild ering and all-too-f amiliar dich otomy: the majority, - 17 0 -"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR who think and fe el in terms of minimizing conflict, sharing when necessary , and living out their lives with the people they love , and the mino rity, who prosper from conflict, and for whom life is no more and no less than a constant competition fo r dominance.

Heinz's Dilemma Tu rning now fr om evolu tionary psy chology to deve lopmental psy­ chology, we come to the interesting question of how conscience de­ velops in human children. Does conscience flower naturally in children's minds as their other mental abilities incr ease, or do chil­ dren acquire and adjust their moral sense as they experience life , fro m lessons taught by fa mil y, soc iety, and cultu re? Conscience as an emotion has not been studied in this way, but we can learn much from what is known about its intellectual partner, mora l rea soning. Moral reasoning is the thought process that atte nds conscience and helps it decide what to do. If we try, we can express our moral reasoning in wor ds, concepts ' , and principl es.

C ons cience, as we know, was Joe's in­ tervening sense of obligation based in his emotional attachment to his dog. Mora l reasoning was the process by which he determined just what that obligation consisted of, and how to accomplish it. (E xactly how hungry will the dog be? Could he die of thirst? Which is more important, the meeting or Reebok? What is the right thing to do?) Where does it come fr om, this nea rly universal abili ty to ask moral and ethical ' questions of ourselv es, about everyth ing fr om whethe r or not · to fe ed the dog to whethe r or not to launch a nuclear missile? The syste matic study of moral reasoning began in the 19 30s 'with Swiss psycho logist Jean Pia get. In one of his most influential works , Th e Mora l Ju d gment o f t h e C h i l d , Pia get analyzed children's perspec­ tives on authori ty, ly ing, stealing, and the concept of justice. He be­ gan by recording detailed observations of how children at dif fe rent ages concei ve d of rules and played games, and of how they inter­ preted moral dilemmas. Piaget's approach was \"structura l,\" meaning that he believed human beings dev eloped psychologically and philo­ sophic ally in a progressi ve fa shion, each cognitive -developmental step building on the previous one, and that the course of this \"devel­ opment proteeded in the same order for all children. Pia get described two general stages of moral dev elopment. The · first stage is the \"morality of constraint ,\" or \"moral realism ,\" in which children obey rules because rules are regarded as inalterable. At this black-and-white stage of reasoning, young children believe that a particular deed is either abso lutely right or absolutely wrong and that people will inevitably be punished fo r wrong behavior that is discov­ ered, an expectation Piag et called \"imminen t justi ce .\" The second Piag �tian stage is the \"morali ty of coopera tion ,\" or \"recipr oc ity. \" At this stage , children view rules as relat ive and subject to alteration un­ der certain circums tances, and their concept of justice gives consid- - 17 2 -"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOPATH NEXT DOOR . eration to people's inten tions.

Continuing in the Piagetian tradition, and influenced also by the , work of the American philosopher John Dewey, psychologist and ed- \\ \" ucator Law rence Kohlberg began his work on moral judgment in the .late 1960s, at Harvard University's Cen ter fo r Moral Education. Kohlberg's ambition was to discover whethe r or not there truly were ,univ ersal stages of moral dev elopment. Kohlberg's theory is based on interviews with boys , ages six to ,sixt een, in the United State s, Ta iw an, Mexico, Tu rkey, and the Yu catan. During these interviews , the children listen�d to ten sto­ . ries, each invol ving a moral dilemma of some kind. The best known of these stor ies, a little vignette composed nearly fo rty years ago, is strikingly evocative of the current controversy surrounding pharma­ ceutical corporations and the cost of prescription medications. It is Hei nz's dilemma, which, in paraphrase, is this: Heinz's wife is dying from a rare form of cancer. According to the doctors , there is one drug that could save her, a radium com­ pound that a druggist in Heinz's town has rece ntly dis covere d. The ingredients for the drug are expensiv\\! to begin with , and the druggist is charging ten times what it costs him to make the medicine . The druggist pays two hundred dollars ·for the radium and charges his customers two thousand dollars for a small dose. Heinz goes to everyone he can think of and asks to borrow money. Still, he ends up with only about one thousand dollars. Heinz ex plains to the druggist that his wife will die without the drug, and asks him to sell the medicine at a cheaper price or to . take payment later. But the druggist replies, \"No, I discovered the drug, and I'm going to make money from it. \" Heinz becomes 17 3 -"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT desper ate . He breaks into the druggist's store and steals the drug for his wife . Should Heinz have done that? Kohlberg was primarily interested not in the children's yes or no answers to \"Sh ould Heinz have done that?\" but in the reasoning be­ hind their responses, which he recor ded. Based on his many inter­ views , he proposed that children fo llow a univ ersal course fro m self-interest to principled behavior that can be described by a three­ level scheme of- moral dev elopment. The three leve ls of moral devel­ opment require increas ingly complex and abstract thought patte rns, each leve l displacing the previous one as the child mature s cogni­ tivel y. According to Kohlberg's theory of moral deve lopment, seven- to ten-year -old children reason on the \"precon ventional lev el,\" at which they defer to adult authority and obey rules based only on expecta­ tions of punishment and rew ard. Kohlberg considered that the pre­ conve ntional reasoning of yo ung children was essen tially \"premor al. \" The most typical \"premoral\" response to He inz's dilemma would be .. \"No, Heinz shouldn't have done that, because now he'll be punish ed.\" Beginning at about age ten, children move to the \"c onventi onal level\" of moral reasonipg (con ventional in the societal sense ), when their behavior is guided by the opinions of other people and a desire to confo rm. At this lev el, obeying authority becomes a value in itself, without ref erence either to immedi ate rewards and punishmen ts or to higher principles. Kohlberg believed that by the time a child was thirteen, most moral questions were answ ered on the conven tional lev el. The conve ntional reasoning about Hein z's thef t would be, ' \"No, he shouldn't have stolen the drug. Stealing is against the law. Everyone knows that .\" . Sometime during adolescence , according to Kohlberg, a few peo­ ple develop beyond the conventi onal leve l to the third and highest lev el, which he called \"postconventional moral ity. \" This third level re- - 17 4 -"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR quires the individual to fo rmulate abstract moral principles ' and to act on them to satisfy his own conscience , . rather than to gain the ap­ proval of others .

And what , most likel y, is the ma jor flaw in Kohlberg's ov erall research design? It is that when he originally asked his moral ques­ tions , he asked them only of boys . Kohlberg, a brilliant social scien­ tist, somehow managed to ov erlook half the human race. This ove rsight was addressed in 19 82 , in a groundbreaking book by Carol Gilligan, entitled In a Di ff erent Vo ice: Psyc h o l ogica l T h eory an d Wo mens Deve l opment. A student of Kohlber g's, Gilligan too was interested in adv ancing a universal stage theory of moral develop­ ment, but she strongly disagreed . with the limited content of the moral levels Kohlberg had proposed. Kohlberg, she said, had pro­ duced a model of moral reasoning that was based on an \"ethic of jus­ tice ,\" a preoccupation with \"the rul es,\" be they concrete or abstract. Gilligan believed that Kohlberg had deri ved only an \"ethic of justice\" because he had interviewed only males, and that if women were in­ terviewe d, a very different syst em of ideals would emerge. She inter­ viewed women who were making momentous' decisions in their lives and discovered that these women were thinking about the caring thing to do, rather than pondering \"the rules .\" Wo men, decided Gilligan, reasoned morally �ccording to an \"ethic of car e,\" rat her than a male \"ethic of justi ce .\" She theorized that this was so because girls identify with their mothers and tend to have experiences within the fa mily that emphasize interpersonal responsi ve ness. Gilligan argued eloquen tly that neither vantage point was supe­ rior to the other, but that the two ethics simply informed two dif fer­ ent voice s. Men spoke of at tachment to societal and personal rules, and women spoke of at tachment to people . Wo men's moral dev el­ opment, Gilligan said\" was based not solely on changes in cogni tive capability but also on maturational changes in the way the self and the social envi ronment were perceiv ed. A woman's postconv entional judgment regarding Heinz's dilemma would refer to the importance of his relationship with his 17 6"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR wife , and might asser t as well that the druggist's claim was immoral because he was allowing someone to die when he could do some­ thing to prevent it. Gillig an was persuaded that postconve ntional reasoning in wo men fo cused on the value of doing no harm to self or others, which is more specific and relational, and in many ways more demanding, than a principle such as the general sanctity of lif e. Thanks to Carol Gilligan, psychologists and educators now un­ derstand that moral reasoning has more than onje dimension and . that people develop morally in much more complex ways than we first believed. In the last twenty years, newer studies have shown us that both women and men may use both an \"ethic of care\" and an ' \"ethic of justice\" in their moral reasoning. These two voices speak in complex choruses, and gender dif ferences are far more intricate than a single unambiguous line betw een all women and all men. We now know also that there are probably no universal stages of moral development through which all human be ings evetyWhere pass, even when we divide the human race in half by gender. Cultural relativism exists even in the moral domain. And if moral reasoning has two dimensions, one of justice and one of care, then why not three dimensions, or hundreds, or more? Why not as many perspe ctives as there are human situations, value s, and ways to raise children? One illustration of the sig nificance of context and culture in moral judg ment is the work of Joan Miller and David Bers off of Ya le Univers ity. Miller and Ber soff have studied American children and adults from New Haven, Connecticut, as compared with Hindu children and adults fr om Mysore Ci ty, in southern India .

The same situation would be seen by a Hi ndu Indian as a nonnegotiable moral impe rative (d harma ), along with an expectation that the family would compel the fu lfillment of this duty if necess ary. Furthe rmore, Indians bel ieve that interpersonal duty is a natural part of what most individuals are inclined to do an yway, as opposed to Americans, who believe that social expectations and per­ sonal wishes are almost always opposed to each other and that one must somehow strike a \"balance\" between them. Such dif ferences in belief and earl y instruction are large , and they tend to create substantial cross:c ultural diversity in moral rea­ soning. Miller and Bersoff report that Hindu Indians, both men and wome n, develop according to a \"du ty-based perspe ctive ,\" a dimen­ sion of moral judgment that is diff erent from both the \"ethic of justice\" and the \"ethic of care .\" They conclud e, \"We interpret our re­ sults as implying that qual itatively distinct types of interpersonal moral codes develop in American and Hindu In dian culture s, re­ flecting the contrasting cultural views of the self emphasized in each set ting.\" And ye t, despi te the many and diverse processes of moral judg­ ment spun off by our various human cult ures, in the final analysis there is something more to the heart of the matter, something deeper and much less variab le.

To make matters worse, brutal conquerors a Y{ d empire builders are usually held in awe by their contempora ries, and during their life­ times they are often seen as role models for the entire human race. No doubt countless thirte enth-century Mongol boys were put to bed with tales of the indomitable Genghis Khan, and one wonders which of the modem heroes we tout to our own children will ultimately be remembered by history as motiv ated by ruthless self-inte rest. Sexual conquest also is served rather well by the absence of con­ science. To illustrate this point using the offspring of the same fa­ mous tyrant , Genghis Khan's eldest son, Tushi Khan, is said to have sired forty sons via his birthright to pick from the most beautiful women of the conquere d. The remainder of the vanquishe d, along with their sons, were routinely slaughtere d. One of Genghis's many grandsons, Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty, had twenty­ two legitimate sons, and added thirty virgins to his harem every year. And as of the time I write these words, virtually identical Y chromo­ somes are carried by .almost 8 percent of the men living in the region of the former Mongol Empire, 16 million of them. Geneticists be­ lieve this means that some 16 million people living in the twenty-first century are stamped with Genghis Khan's thirteenth-century legacy of genocide and rape. Genghis Khan was exceptional among sociopathic tyrants in that · he did not die a violent or an ignominious death. Instead, he fell off a horse during a hunt, in 1227. By far most perpetrators of genocide and mass rape eventually take their own lives or are kill<?d, often by enraged followers who have had enough. Caligula was assass inated by one of his own guards.

Cambodia' s Pol Pot died in a two-room hut, held prisoner by former associates, his body burned under a pile of garbage and rubber tires. Global sociopaths most typically come to no good end, and this sharply downward tendency is displayed by the more local ones as well. In the final analy sis, sociopa thy appears to be a losing game, re­ gardless of its scale. ' Hannah's father, for example, lost every thing that should have been precious to him. By the time he was fifty, he had fo rfeited his job, his position in the communi ty, his beautiful wife, and his loving daughter, all for the exhilaration of being a mi­ nor player in the heroin game , and in the end, he is likely to die from iil bullet to his own head, from the gun of some other small-time criminal. Luke , my patient Sydney's deadbeat ex, also lost everything that was valuable-his wife, his son, and even his swimming pool. Super Skip, though he blithely deems himself to be too unassailable and too smart to be brought down by the likes of the Securities and Exchange Commission, probably will prove to be neither when the SEC finally sets upon him in earnest. \"Dr.\" Doreen Little field, even with a mind fully sharp enough to pursue a real Ph:D., will instead migrate as a fake to more and more obscure locations, playing the same tedious games with the decent people she envies, until she runs I -- out of places to hide.

Does she really possess what you would love to have in your life, or, instead, is she isolate d, burned-out, and bored? Is it perhaps stunning the way the mighty have fallen? Since we began to record wars, occupations, and projects of genoci de, historians have often remarked that a certain type of cat­ astrophic, amoral villain seems to be born over and over into the human race. No sooner are we rid of one than anothe r appears somewhere else on the planet. From the point of view of population genet ics, there is probably some truth to this legend. And since we do not understand these people, since their psychology is so alien to most of us, we often do not recognize or stop them until after they have damaged humanity in unfath omable ways . But, as Gandhi pointed out with such wonder and relief, \"in the end, they always fall-think of it, always !\" 1be same phenomenon occurs on smaller scales too. Ordinary people without conscience visit pain on their families and communi­ ties, but in the end, they tend to self-destruct . Small-time sociopaths would surVive long enough to dominate some of the others on our imaginary deser t island, maybe promulgate some genes, but at the end of the day, they would probabl y be hung up by their heels. Part of the reason for this eventual failure is obvious, espec ially in cases where infamo us despots such as Mussolini or Pol Pot have been killed and mutilated by angry ex-followe rs. If you oppress, rob, murder, and rape enough people, eventually some of them will gang up on you and take their revenge . We can see this in the much less epic story of Doreen Little field as well. The odds were always against her, and finally she just happened to make the wrong person mad. But there are additional reasons, less obvious, for the long-term fail­ ure of living without a conscience, reasons that are endemic to the psychology of socio pathy rather than the rage of other people. And the first of these is boredom, plain and simple. - 185 -"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"\" 1 MARTHA STOUT Is That All There Is? Though we all know what bored ? m is, most normal adults do not ex­ perience sheer boredom very often. We are stressed, rushed, and worried, but we are seldom purely bored-in part because we are so stressed, rushed, and worried. Time without anything we must at­ tend to usual ly feels like a breather, not like monoton y. To get a feel for what sheer boredom is like, we must hearken back to childhood. Children and adolescents are frequently bored, so bored they can hardly even stand it. Their perfectly normal developmental need for constant stimula tion, for exploring and ongoing learning, is of ten thwarted in a world of long trips, rainy afternoons, and study halls. In childhood, boredom can be excrucia ting, like a chronic spiritual headache , or a powerful thirst with no beverage to be had. It can hurt so bad that the poor kid feels like yelling out loud, or throwing something noisy at a wall. Extreme boredom is arguably a form of pain. Lucky for us, adults do not have the same need for constant stimulati on. Despite our stresses, we tend to live within a fairly man­ ageable window of arousal, neither unbearably overstimulated nor understimulated-except for sociopaths. Pe � ple who are sociopaths report that they.crave extra stimulation almost continua lly. Some use the wqrd a dd icte d , as in a dd icte d to thrills , a dd icte d to risk. Such ad­ dictions occur because the best (maybe the only) consistent cure for understimulation is our emotional life, so much so that in many psy­ chology texts, the terms arousa l and emotiona l resp onse are used al­ most interchangea bly. We are st.imula ted by our mean ingful ties to, negotiations with, and happy and unhappy moments alongside other people , and sociopaths do not have this emotional life to live. They do not experience the' sometimes harrowing, sometimes thrilling, ever-present arousal that unavo idably attends genuine attachments to other people. - 186"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR Labo ratory experiments using electric shocks and loud noises have found that even the physiological reactions (sweating, racing heart, and so forth) normally associated with anxious anticipation and learned fear are far less pronounced in sociopaths. For adequate stimula tion, sociopaths have only their games of domination, and these games get old and stale very quickl y. Like drugs, the games have to be done over and over, larger and better, and depending on the resources and talents of the particular sociopath, this may not be possible. And so in socio pathy, the pain of boredom can be nearly constant. The inclination to dilute boredom chemically for a while is part of the reason sociopaths tend to be alcohol and drug abusers. A major comor b idity study published in 19 90 in the Jo urnal o f t h e A merican Me d ical A sso ciation estimates that as many as 75 percent of sociopaths are dependen t. on alcohol, and 50 percent abuse other drugs. And so sociopaths are often addicts in the usual sense, in ad­ dition to being figuratively addicted to risk. With its \"peak experi­ ences\" and its dangers, the drug culture holds more than one form of appeal for the consciencel ess, and the drug culture is where many sociopaths feel most at home. Another study, published in 19 93 in the A merican Journal o f Psyc h iatry, found that 18 percent of intraveno � s-drug abusers diag­ nosed with antisocial persona lity disorder were H IV -positive , while only 8 percent of intrav enous-drug abusers without antisocial per­ sonality disorder tested positive for HIV. The higher odds ratio of HIV inf ection among sociopa ths is presumably due to their greate r risk-taking behaviors. These statistics bring qs back to a question I posed in the first chapter: Is the absence of conscience an adaptive condition, or is it a mental disorder?

Common sense tells us that the pres­ ence of any of the recognized mental disorde rs-maj or depression, chronic anxiety , paranoia, and so forth- would likely cause woeful \"life disrupti on.\" But what about the a b sence of something we usually regard as a strictly moral trait? What about the absence of con­ science? We know that sociopaths almost never seek treatment, but do they suffer \"life disruption\" noneth eless? A way of approaching this issue is to consider what is meaning­ ful in life to the 'sociop ath- winning and domination-and then to ponder the following odd question: Why are all sociopaths not in po­ sitions of great power? Given their focused motiv ation, and granted the freedom of action that results from having no conscience what­ soever, they should all be formidable national leaders or interna­ tional CEOs, or at . least high-ranking professionals or dictators of small count ries. Why do they not win all the time? For they do not. Instead, most of them are obscu re people , and limited to dominating their young children, or a depressed spouse , or perhaps a few employees or cowor kers. Not an insignificant num­ ber of them are in jail, like Hannah's father, or in: danger for their ca­ reers or their lives. Very few are fabulously wealthy like Skip. Even fewer are famous. Having never made much of a mark on the world, the majority are on a downward life course, and by late middle age will be burned out completel y. They can rob and torment us tem­ poraril y, yes, but they are, in ef fect, failed lives.

The absolute self-involve ment of socio pathy creates an in­ dividual consciousness that is aware of every little ache and twitch in the body, every passing sensation in the head and chest, and ears that orient with acute personalized concern to every radio and television report about every thing from bedbug s to ricin. Because his concerns and awareness are geared exclusi vely toward himself, the person without conscience sometimes lives in a torment of hypochondriacal reactions that would make even the most fretful anxiety neurotic appear rational. Gettidg a paper cut is a major event, and a cold sore is the beginning of the end. Perhaps the most famous historical example of the sociopath's obsession with his body is Adolf Hitler, who was a lifelong hy­ pochondriac with an overpowe ring fear of developing cancer. In an attempt to keep cancer at bay, and to cure a long list of other imag­ inary health problems, he swallowed \"remedies\" formulate d specially by h is favorite personal physician, Dr. Theodore Morell. Many of these tablets contained hallucinogenic toxins. In this way, Hitler . gradually poisoned himself into actual illness. Most likely on account of this, a tremor (a real one) in his right hand became conspicuous, and by mid-1944, he was disall owing photographs . Sociopaths sometimes use their hypochondriasis as a strategy to get out of doing work. One moment they are fine, but then it is time to pay the bills or look for a job or help a friend move to a new apart­ ment, and sudde nly they have chest pains or a limp. And imaginary medical concerns and infirmities often secure special treatment, , such as the one last chair in an overcrowd ed room.

Getting up . every single morning and working for a long succession of hours is I almost never considered.

In such settings , a smart sociopath can some­ times keep things going with an occasional splashy perf ormanc e, or by schmoozing and being charming, or by being intimidating. She poses herself as the absentee super visor, or the \"rainmaker,\" or the invaluable \"high-strung genius .\" She requires frequent vacations, or sabba ticals in which · her actual activit ies are somewhat mysterious. Sustained work, the true key to lasting success -keeping one's nose to the grindstone , tolerating tedium, seeing to the details-is a little too close to responsib ility. Sadly, this same self-limiting factor tends to apply even to so­ ciopaths who are born with special gifts and talents. The kind of in­ tense commitment and daily work required to develop and promote one's art, one's music, or any other creative project is. typically im­ possible for a sociopath. If success can be acquired fortu itously, with only episodic input, then perhaps. But if the art requires a prolonged personal investment , it is lost. In the end, a person Without con­ science has the same relationship to her own gifts as she does to other people . She does not take care of them. And sociopathy is almost always a solo routine , another strate gy that may sometimes work temporarily but not often in the long run. For the obvious reason of unremitting self-inte rest, people without conscience make lousy team players., The sociopath is out for him­ self alone. When he deals with another person, or with a group of people, he attempts to do so by lies, flatte ry, and the creation of fear. These approaches to success are far weaker and more short-lived than are genuine relating, leadership, and personal involve ment, and goals that might have been reached in a partnership, or in a sus­ tained group effort, are usually scuttled by the soci0 path's exclusi ve concern with himself.

When the thrill of manipulating other people takes over, as it does in sociopa thy, all other objectives are eclipsed, and the result­ ing \"life disrupti on,\" though of a different sort, can be just as severe as the limitations imposed by major depression, chronic anxiety , paranoia, and other mental illnesses. And the emotional bankruptcy of sociopathy means that the sociopath is forever deprived of an au­ thentic emotional intelligence, a capacity for understanding how people work that is an irreplaceable guide for living in the human world. Like Doreen, who actually believes she can increase her per­ sonal power by diminishing others, like Skip, who imagines himself permanently immune to society and its rules, like the defeated dic­ tator who is bewildered because the hate-filled mob composed of \"his people\" will not allow him to negotia te, a person without con­ science , even a smart one, tends to be a shortsighted and surpris ingly naIve individual who eventually expires of boredom, financial ruin, or a bullet. Extreme Conscience Still, the most compelling reason for desiring to have conscien ce, rather than wishing to be free of it, is not the list of ruinous disad­ vanta ges that accrue to sociopa thy. No, the best part of possessing a moral sense is the deep and beautiful gift that comes to us inside, and on l y inside, the wrappings of conscien ce.

Now we turn this psychologi­ cal equation around. The other truth is that should a person have no conscien ce, he. could never truly love. When an impe rative sense of responsibili ty is subtracte d from love, all that is left is a thin, tertiary thing-a will to possess, which is not love at all. Just after September 11 , 2001, even as a D: especial ly dark and ag­ gressi ve chapter . in our history began, my psychologist friend Bernie told me without he,sitation that he would choose conscience over the apparent expediency of being without conscience, but that he could not articulate why. I believe Bernie's intuitive preference was due to the inextricable link between conscience and the ability to love, and that if given the choice between all the power, fame, and money in the world and the privilege of loving his own children, Bernie would choose the lat ter in a heartbeat. In part, this is because Bernie is a good person. Also, this is because Bernie is a good psychologist, and he knows something about what actually makes people happ y. There is the will to possess and to dominate, and then there is love. Whether or not he could express his reasons at that moment, in choosing conscience , Bernie the psychologist effectively chose love, and this does not surprise me. Dominating cim constitute a temporary thrill, but it does not make people happy. Loving does. But is it not possible to have too much conscience? Are there not psychologists who have said that, far from happin ess, people can be tyrannized and driven into serious depression by their consciences? .Yes and no. Freud observed that an overactive superego CO \\lId bully its owner into depression and possibly even suicide .

When contempo­ rary psychologists say that too much conscience is toxic , their vo­ cabulary is careless. They are referring instead to unhealthy shame, or to a strident superego working overtime . Conscien ce, our seventh sense, is a different phenomenon alto­ gether. It is a feeling of obligation based in love. So the question lingers: Is extreme conscience debilitating or elevating? / To understand what a great deal of conscience does to the psy­ che, we can observe the lives and the happiness level of people who , have deve loped their innate Sense of conscience into an especial ly powerful emotional muscle . Each one of us might name different in­ dividuals as our moral hero es, from historical or public figures to people we have known personally who have impressed us with their moral commitment. In a systematic study of such people, Anne Colby of Radcl iffe's Henry Murray Research Center and William Damon of Brown Univers ity's Department of Education made choices of their own. Concerned about what they perceived as our current scarcity of moral leadership, Colby and Damon selected twenty-t hree individuals whom they considered to be \"moral exem­ plars ,\" eleven men and twelve women whose moral commitment has resulted in signal contributions in many areas, including civil rights and civil liber ties, the reduction of poverty and hunger, religious freedom, environmental protec tion, and peace. These twenty-t hree people are diverse in terms of race, religion, socioeconomic status, o and specific goals, but all have one thing in common.: an extra ordi­ narily powerful sense of conscience, an \"overdev eloped\" sense that , they are responsible for the welfare of their fellow human beings. They represent, from a psychologist's vantage point, the diametric emotional and mental opposite of the sociopaths we have been dis­ cussing. 0_ 193 -"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Colby and Damon's \"moral exemplars\" include Virgiriia Foster Durr, the Southern belle turned civil rights activist who was the first person to hug Rosa Parks when she stepped out of jail; Suzie Valadez; who has spent many years feeding, clothing, and providing medical care to thousands of poor Mexicans in Ciudad Juarez; Jack Coleman, a former president of Haverford College, noted for his \"blue- collar sabbaticals\" as a ditch digger, ,a garbag eman, a homeless person; businessman Cabell Brand, who devoted himself to the cre­ ation of Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke, Virginia ; and Charles zetta Waddles, fo under of the Perpetual Mission, who .dedi­ cated her life to helping the elderly and the poor, the unwed moth­ ers, the prostitute s, and the abused children of Detroit, Michigan.

In a book that documents their findings, entitled S ome Do C are: C ontemporary Lives o f Mora l C ommitment, they report three striking commonalities among individuals of ex­ treme conscience . The authors label these shared characteristics as (1) \"certa inty, \" (2) \"posi tivity, \" and (3) \"unity of self and moral goals .\" \"Cer tainty\" refers to an exceptional clarity concerning what the exemplars belie ve to be right , and also their sense of an un­ equivocal personal responsibility to act on those beliefs. \"Posi tivity\" expresses the e�emplars' affirmative approach to life, their extraor­ dinary enjoyment of their work, and their marked optimism, often despi te hardship or even danger.

When conscience grows sufficie ntly strong, apparen tly it unifies the human psyche in a unique and beneficial way, and rather than caus­ ing \"life disrupti on,\" extreme conscience significantly enhances life satisfact ion. Colby and Damon write, \"Our exemplars ,have been in­ vulnerable to the debilitating effects of privation because all they have needed for personal success is the productive pursuit of their moral mission .\" In unself -conscious defiance of our cultural ten­ dency to set conscience and self-interest in opposition to each other, Colby and Damon's exemplars \"defined their own welfare and self­ interest in moral terms and were , with very ' few excep tions, ex­ tremely happy and fulfille d.\" Far from causing them suffering, or making them into dupes, their exceptional sense of obligation to other people made them happ y.

At this very moment, . though she cannot actually see Tillie on her back deck like Greta and Jerry can, Sunny too is thinking about how mean Tillie is. Yesterd ay, Tillie called the police because Sunny had parked her car on the . stre<;!t in front of her own house.

And that car was ' nowhere near Tillie's house! As Sunny laments across the street, Tillie, on her backyard deck, decides that the groundhog is not going to reappear right now. She goes back into her house, where she can no longer be seen by the breakf asting Greta and Jerry up the hill. While Greta and Jerry drink the rest of their coffee and try to talk about something else, Tillie, in her kitchen, picks up the phone and calls Catherine, the next-door neighbor with whom she now shares a groundhog. Catherine teaches the sixth grade. She has taught school since she was twenty-two , and now her sixtieth birthday is coming. She thinks she ought to retire, but the notion only makes her sad. Her teaching, her kids, mean the world to her, and she really does not want to stop working. Her husband, Fred, who is seven years older and already retired, understands this and is patient with her. \"Whenever you're ready,\" he always says. \"I like to putter around the house and fix things anyway. \" And then they both laugh. Fred can barel y replace burned-out lightb ulbs. Until he reluctantly gave up the mantle a year ago, he was the editor of their regional news­ paper. He is a good, quiet, bookish man who loved his work , too, and still contributes an \"eme ritus\" human-interest column called \"People You Should Know. \" When the phone rings, Fred is reading in the living .room, and Catherine is in the kitchen, getting ready to go to work early. The trill of the phone at such an hour makes Catherine jump. She answers it quickly. \"Hel lo?\" \"Catherine ,\" says Tillie abruptl y, snipping the word as if she were angry. \"Yes, this is Catherine. Tillie? Tillie, my goodness, it's seven in the morning.

As she finishes her morning routine , Catherine feels conf used and slightly & at ease, knowing that with Tillie there is always a thickening plot, and that the denouemen t is likely to be controlling , and upsetting.

How about lunch time? Also, Fred knows the chief of police very well, and maybe something can be done about the problem with Sunn y's parking space .. Te aching her class of sixth graders all day, Catherine forgets about Tillie, but �hen she gets home at about 4: 30, she remembers the early-morning phone call and begins to feel uneasy all over again. She was planning to take a nap before dinner, but as she sits down on the bed, her uneasiness gets suddenly stronger, and she is drawn to the window. The bedroom is on th� second floor, and from here, Catherine has a clear view of the whole backyard, and Tillie's as well. The day has been unseasonably warm, and all those nice forsythias Fred planted at the back edge of their yard are beginning to bloom. There is the wide back lawn, and beyond that the long row of little yellow forsyth ia blossoms, and then the gray�brown shadow of the · still-leafless conser vation forest that borders all the backyards on this side of the street. And also, rather strangel y, there is Tillie, standing right in the middle of her lawn . She is still wearing her checkered blue-an d-white dress and has added a wide-brimmed straw hat, as if she were about to do some ladylike gardening. But Tillie never gardens. As Catherine watches from her bedroom window, Tillie looks around the yard , seems to spy something she wants , and marches ov�r to it. She bends and, with obvious effort, lifts an object from the ground that looks to Catherine like a large white rock, about the size and shape of a small watermelon.

A phrase from the morning's phone conversation echoes in Catherine's head-\"in the back! betw een our properties\"-and in this same moment, Catherine knows exactly what Tillie is doing. The groundhog's burrow! Tillie is going to use that rock to plug up the den of the groundhog she told her about. Catherine is appalled. She feels light- headed and sick, almost as if she were witne ssing a murder. She needs to do something, but go­ ing out and confront ing Tillie direc tly would be like arguing with a rabid wolve rine. In truth , though Catherine does not like to admit this to herself, Tillie frightens her in general, ,for reasons she cannot even put into words. Why should a rather insignificant seventy-year­ old woman frighten her? And how did Tillie know she would be watching from the house right now? Did she know? Catherine begins to pace across the bedroom, from the window to the old oak dresser and back to the wind ow. She sees TiUie drop the rock clumsily onto a spot just beyond the forsythias, midway be­ tween two small willows at the edge of the woods, and she marks the location caref ully in her mind. Then she paces back to the dresser and stares at herself in the antique mirror. While Tillie swipes , at loose dirt on the front of her dress and parades back across the lawn to her deck, Catherine continues to stare into her own eyes in the mirror. That poor little animal, she keeps thinking. What if he's trapped? Fina lly, Catherine knows what she wants to do. And she must tell Fred. He can help.

They make dinner together, as is their habit, and wait until about nine o'clock, when it is completely dark outside. Fred suggests flash­ lights , but Catherine thinks Tillie would see them. \"She'll know we liberated him, and she'll just cover him again to­ morrow. \" \"We'll have to take at least one, to find the burrow once we get there .\" \"Yes. Right. Okay, maybe a penlight? For when we get there .\" They set out across the yard at a snail's pace, so as not to trip in the dark ness. Fred takes the lead, and Catherine follows , arms held out in front of her like a sleep walke r's, to keep her balance. When they get to the far end of the lawn , they follow along the row of for­ sythia bushes until there are no more forsyt hias.

The good-f or-nothing real estate agent keeps telling her that not using a sign is shooting herself in the foot, and that he really thinks she should wait for a higher offer.

They were not being pious or courag eous, not particula rly effective , and certain ly not rational. It was simply that trying to help the animal seemed right and somehow made them fe el good. Moving that rock was, to use an old and universally understood expres sion, \"good for their souls .\" Where conscience is concerne d, over the centuries Western cul­ ture has progressed from faith in an immutable God-sen t knowledge of right and wrong to a belief in Freud's concept of a punitive super­ ego to an understanding that conscience is based in our normal and positive relatedness to one another. As an interv ening sense of re­ sponsibility seated in our emotional attachments , conscience has . evolved into a purely psychological construct. But, in a kind of philo­ sophical full circle back to its beginnings in the church, conscience is also the place where psychology and spirituality meet, an issue on which the recommendations of psychology and the teachings of the major religious and spiritual traditions of the world completely con­ cur. In a remarkable confluence-even the radical materialists and the mystics in a tacit meeting of the minds-behavioral science, evo­ lutionary psychol ogy, and all traditional theologies agree that having a strong conscience is extremely advantage ous, and that not having one at all most commonly leads to disaster, for groups and also for individ uals. A psychologist would say that when we take some responsibility for the welfare of others, our actions feel natural (or \"ego-s yntonic\") and our own life satisfaction is enhanc ed. The Bible says simpl y, \"It is more blessed to give than to recei ve.\" As a psychologist, I can tell you that the absence of an interv ening sense of responsibility based in emotional attachment is associated with an endless, usual ly futile preoccupation with domination, and results in substantial life dis­ ruption and eventual deterioration. Buddha put it this way: \"All that we are is the result of what we have thought . If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him. If a man speaks or acts with -· 210 -"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR . a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.\" In their psychological study of individuals with .exce ptional con­ science, Anne .Colby and William Damon write , \"A pos itivity that in­ .cludes optimism, love, and joy is ... closely linked with moral ity, as we see in the lives of our exemplars .\" Buddha again agrees. He says, \"To walk safely through the maze of human life, one needs the light of wisdom and the guidance of virtue.\" And, of cour se, there is the Golden Rule , which is humankind's most ancient ethic of reciprocity, and perhaps the most succinct and clear ly operationalized moral philosophy ever concei ved. Confucius was merely recording an even older Chinese saying when he wrote, \"Do not do to others what you would not want done to you,\" and when Jesus said, \"Do unto others as you would hllVe them do unto you,\" he was referring to an already time-honored Jewish proverb that instructe d, \"What is hatef ul to you, do not to your fello� man. This is the law: all the rest is commen tary. \" The Mah abharata tells followers of Hinduism, \"This is the sum of the Dharma: Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you.\" And in in­ digenous traditions as well-the Yoruba of Nigeria say, \"One going to take a pointed stick to pinch a baby bird should first try it on him­ self to feel how it hurts .\" And the Lakota religious leader Black Elk taught , \"All things are our relativ es; what we do to everything, we do to ourselv es. All is really One.\" The smattering of religions that do not adhere to moral reci- , procity are contemporary, and tend to make the moral warmth of the ancient Golden Rule seem even more attractive by their own blood­ chilling nature . As an illustratio n, one can cite the Creativity Movement, a milita ntly anti-Semitic and anti-Christian group for- . merly called the World Church of the Creator, which is a religion founded on the love of the \"White Race\" and the prescribed hatred of everyone else. Within this doctrine , everyone who is not \"White\" is by definition a member of one of the \"mud races.\" The central - 211 -"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOUT moral precept of the Creati vity Movement is expressed as follows : \"What is good for the White Race is the highest virtue ; what is bad for the White Race is the ultimate sin.\" Unsurprisingl y, the long-term goal of the Creati vity Movement is to organize the \"White Race\" to achie ve world domination. . In welcome contra st, most religions and spiritual traditions sub­ scribe to the Golden Rule, and also to some form of Black Elk's be­ lief that \"All is really One.\" Oneness is a more fundamental tenet for some religions than · others. For example, while the Judea-Christian tradition instructs its followers to love their neighbors, Eastern mys- . ticism teaches that indiv iduality, the ego, is an illusion to begin with , that we are not distinct from God or from one another, and there­ fore, in a spiritual sense , we are our neighbors. In Peace Is Every Step, Vietn amese Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh tries to explain this aspect of Eastern thought for Westerners by telling us that we \"inter-are .\" We are ineluctably and inextricably bound up with every­ one and everything in the universe, and this state of interbeing is the reason we should not selfishly (and vainly) chase our goals of indi­ vidual acquisition and power. Though less conspicuousl y, a belief in oneness is part of the Judeo-C hristian tradition as well. In 19 39, as yet another shatte ring attempt at world domination rumbled in Europe, Jewish theologian and philosopher Martin Buber addressed the National Conference of Palestinian Te achers in Tel Aviv. He concluded his address by say­ ing, \"Nothing remains but what rises above the abyss of today's mon­ strous problems, as above every abyss of every time: the wing-beat of the spirit and the creative word. But he who can see and hear out of unity will also behold and discern again what can be beheld and dis­ cerned eterna lly. The educator who helps to bring man back to his own unity will help to put him again face to face with God.\" In whatever traditibn they occur, spiritual practices focused on an aware ness of interbeing tend to have the intriguing psyc hological 212"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE SOCIOP ATH NEXT DOOR side effect of bringing significant earthly happiness to their most de­ voted practi tioners, almost regardless of external circumstance s. In a book that is a collaboration betwe en psychologist Daniel Goleman and His Holiness the Dalai Lama, entitl ed Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama, Goleman write s, \"The very act of concern for othe rs' well-being, it seems, creates a greater state of well-being within oneself. :' In recent years, increasing numbers of scientists have echoed this impression. At a 2002 conference on science aQd the mind, attended by the Dalai Lama, distinguished Austra lian neurobiologist Jack Pettigrew remarke d, \"If you go to Dharamsala [Indian home of the Tibetan community in exile ], you go up through the fog in midwinter and you come out in the bright sunshine , it's like going to heav en. What strike s you immediately is the happy, smiling faces of the Tibetans , who don't have much, have been terribly depriv ed, and yet they are hap py. Well, why are they happy? \" The Dalai Lama himself is interested in answering this question scientifica lly, and in finding a secular way to create the compassion­ ate sense of interbeing that is ashieved by devout practitioners of Tibetan Buddhist meditation. To this end, he has launched an inter­ national series of dialogues between scien tists and Buddhist schol­ ars, the most recent of which, in 2003, was cosponsored by the Mind and Life Institute in C o lorado and the McGovern Institute of the Massac husetts Institute of Te chnology . He intends these dialogues to yield practical solutions to the destructive state s of mind that both the Buddhists and the scientists view as the root of human conflict and suffering. . As a psychologist, I am particularly taken with the Dalai Lama;s description of those whom I might refer to as sociopaths, or as peo­ ple devo id of an inter vening sense of obligation based in connected­ ness to others. He refers to such individuals as \"people who don't have well-dev eloped human lives.\" Mor e specifically, the Dalai Lama - 213 -"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"MARTHA STOU T said of the World Trade Center attacks , \"Technology is a good thing, but the use of technology in the hands of people who don't have well-deve loped human lives can be disastr ous.\" To the extent that a person's capacity to have a well-dev eloped human life is facilitate d or limited by his or her particular gray mat­ ter, this Buddhist conception of sociopa thy highlights what is one of the most interesting confluences of all, that between religion and neuropsychology: Perhaps sociopa thy is a life lesson that is taught not by some phys ical facility or limitati on, but by an emotional de­ bility. In other words, some people must learn what it is like to live with extreme beauty, or no legs, or as a beggar, and ot�e rs, those with no conscience, m,ust learn what it means to live without being able to care about others . There is an irony here, in that this karmic state , if you will, may indeed be a reason to find sociopaths pitiable, as we might pity blind orphans, whether or not we belie ve in the de­ vices of karma. Though psychology recognizes the value of . compassion and of sensing oneness, psychologists have so far not researched any direct methods to achieve these, thus leaving sociopaths and especially our healthier disciples somewhat in the lurch where the heightening of conscience is concern ed. As ways to increase life �atisfa ction, psychol­ ogists increas ingly recommend moral education for nonnal children and giving and volunte erism for adults , but psychologists 'have tradi­ tionally been much more intereste d in endeavors such as \"strengthen­ ing interpersonal boundar ies\" and \"asser tiveness training .\" In this regard , psychology relative to spirituality reminds me of the hungry trave ler in an ancient parable from India calle d \"The Wise Woman's Stone.\" A version of this parable , the author of which is long lost to an- ,tiquity, can be found in a collection of stories compiled by Arthur Lenehan , published in 1994 by, ironica lly, The Economics Press: A wise woman who was trave ling in the mountains found a pre- ' cious stone in a stream.

He knew the stone was worth enough to give him security for a lifet ime. But a few days later he came back to return the stone to the wise wo man. \"I' ve been think ing,\" he said, \"I know how valuable the stone is, but 1 give it back in the hope that you can give me something even more prec ious. Give me what you have within you that en­ abled you to give me the stone . \" The wise and happy Tibetan Buddhists, and cer tainly the ' Dalai Lama himself, are reminiscent of Col by and Damon' s exemplars of extre me conscience , such as Suzie Va ladez, who fe eds the poor in Mexico, and fo rmer college president Jack Coleman, who tried to fo ster his own sense of interb eing and compassion by being a ditch digger, a garbage collector, a homeless person. Both the Buddhist monks and the psychological exemplars illustrate that the awareness prov ided by extre me conscience improves people's lives and makes them happ y. This happiness is not the product of any co gnitive strat­ egy or reattribution of temporary failures to the cosmos and long­ term successes to oneself. In fa ct, Colby and Damon report that most of their moral exemplars are insistent realists regarding the cir­ cumstances of human life and their own limited potential to alter these cond . iti ons. No, rather than mere cogni tive adaptation, excep­ tional cons .cience involves the strong and steadying sen sation of be­ ing part of something greater than oneself.

Whateve ,r its name, it is a powerful integrator of human thought, emotion, and ac­ tion that knew its origins in our primeval biological past. Through our genes, our brains, and perhaps our very souls, it has become a protective , prod uctive , and mood-s ustaining force in our psychblog­ ical and social lives, and for thousands of years has spoken to our most transcendent traditions and to the most admirable members of our race. Conscience is the still small voice that has been trying since the infancy of our species to tell us that we are evolutionaril y, emo­ tiona lly, and spiritually One, and that if we seek peace and happi­ ness, we must behave that way. Conscience , and uniquely conscience, can compel us out of our own skins and into the skin of another, or even into contact with the Absolute. It is based in our emotional ties to one another. In its purest form, it is called love. And wonderf ully; both mystics and evo­ lutionary psychologists , who concur on not much else, agree that people by their normal nature are more likely to be loving than malevolent. This conclusion signifies a breathtaking departure from our usual, more cynical view of ourselv es. Theologians and scientists agree ' also that the human mistakes tending to contravene our normally benevolent nature are twof old; The first mistake is the desire to be personal ly in' control of others and of the world . This motiv ation involves the illusion that domina­ tion is a wort hwh.i le goal, an illusion that is most fixed in the socio­ pathic mind. And the second tragic error is moral exclusion. We know there to be endless danger in'deciding that the \"other\" is some­ thing less than human -the other gender, the other race, the . for­ eigner, the \"enem y,\" and perhaps evert the sociopath himself -wh ich is why the question of what to do with the moral outlaw is such an uneasy one in theology and also in psy'chology. How do we face the potentially catacly smic challenge of people who simp'ly \"don't have well-developed human lives\"?

Try to picture that same face-a parent's, or a daughter's, or a son's-we eping in grief, or smiling in peace and joy. And now imagine for a moment that you could look fo rever and feel absol utely nothing, no love, no desire to help or even to smile back.
