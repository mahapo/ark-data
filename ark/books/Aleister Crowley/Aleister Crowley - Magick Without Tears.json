This chance connection resulted in a stimulating exchange of letters. Crowley then asked others to put similar questions to him. The result was this collection of over eighty letters which are now being issued over the title that he chose, \"MAGICK WITHOUT TEARS\". Crowley did not keep copies of his early letters to the abo ve - mentioned lady, so was unable to include them in the collection that he planned"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 3 to publish. Fortunately they have been preserved and are now included in the introduction to this book. Their original form has been retained with the opening and closing formulae which Crowley used in all his letters. Crowley at first intended to call the book \"ALEISTER EXPLAINS EVERYTHING\", and sent the following circular to his friends and disciples asking them to suggest subjects for inclusion. ALEISTER EXPL AINS EVERYTHING.  __________ \"Much gratified was the author of THE BOOK OF THOTH to have so many letters of appreciation, mostly from women, thanking him for not 'putting it in unintelligible language', for 'making it all so clear th at even I with my limited intelligence can understand it, or think I do.' \"Nevertheless and notwithstanding! For many years the Master Therion has felt acutely the need of some groundwork - teaching suited to those who have only just begun the study of Mag ick and its subsidiary sciences, or are merely curious about it, or interested in it with intent to study. Always he has done his utmost to make his meaning clear to the average intelligent edu - cated person, but even those who understand him perfectly an d are most sympathetic to his work, agree that in this respect he has often failed. \"So much for the diagnosis --- now for the remedy! \"One genius, inspired of the gods, suggested recently that the riddle might be solved somewhat on the old and well - trie d lines of 'Dr. Brewer's Guide to Science'; i.e., by having aspirants write to the Master asking questions, the kind of problem that naturally comes into the mind of any sensible enquirer, and getting"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 4 his answer in the form of a letter. 'What is it?' 'W hy should I bother my head about it?' 'What are it's principles?' 'What use is it?' 'How do I begin?', and the like. \"This plan has been put into action; the idea has been to cover the subjects from every possible angle. The style has been collo - qui el and fluent; technical terms have either been carefully avoided or most carefully explained; and the letter has not been 4 admitted to the series until the querent has expressed satisfaction. Some seventy letters, up to the present have been wr itten, but still there seem to be certain gaps in the demonstration, like those white patches on the map of the World, which looked so tempting fifty years ago. \"This memorandum is to ask for your collaboration and support. A list, indicating briefly the subject of each letter already written, is appended. Should you think that any of those will help you in your own problems, a typed copy will be sent to you at once ... Should you want to know anything outside the scope, send in your question (stated as fully and clearly as possible) ... The answer should reach you, bar accidents, in less than a month ...

Your criticisms of previous experience in the course of your ad - ventures appeared to be singularly sane and just. As I promised I am writing this letter to cover a few practical points which we had not time to discuss and which in any case I think it better to arrange by correspon - dence. 1) It is of the first importance that you should understand my personal position. It i s not actually wrong to regard me as a teacher, but it is certainly liable to mislead; fellow - student, or, if you like, fellow - sufferer, seems a more appropriate definition. The climax of my life was what is known as the Cairo Working, described in the minutest detail in the Equinox of the Gods. At that time most of The Book of the Law was completely unintelligible to me, and a good deal of it - especially the third chapter - extremely antipathetic. I fought against this book for years; but it proved i rresistible. I do not think I am boasting unfairly when I say that my personal researches have been of the greatest value and importance to the study of the subject of Magick and Mysticism in general, especially my integration of the vari - ous thought - sys tems of the world, notably the identification of the system of the Yi King with that of the Qabalah. But I do assure you that the whole of my life's work, were it multiplied a thousand fold, would not be worth one tithe of the value of a single verse of T he Book of the Law. I think you should have a copy of the Equinox of the Gods and make The Book of the Law your constant study. Such value as my own work may possess for you should amount to no more than an aid to the interpretation of this book. 2) It may be that later on you will want a copy of Eight Lectures on Yoga so I am putting a copy aside for you in case you should want it."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 7 3) With regard to the O.T.O., I believe I can find you a typescript of all the official documents. If so, I wil l let you have them to read, and you can make up your mind as to whether you wish to affiliate to the Third Degree of the Order. I should consequently, in the case of your de - ciding to affiliate, go with you though the script of the Rituals and ex - plain the meaning of the whole thing; communicating, in addition, the real secret and significant knowledge of which ordinary Masonry is not possessed 4) The horoscope; I do not like doing these at all, but it is part of the agreement with the Grand Treasu rer of the O.T.O. that I should under - take them in worthy cases, if pressed. But I prefer to keep the figure to myself for future reference, in case any significant event makes consulta - tion desirable. 6 Now there is one really important matter . The only thing besides The Book of the Law which is in the forefront of the battle. As I told you yester - day, the first essential is the dedication of all that one is and all that one has to the Great Work, without reservation of any sort. This must be kept constantly in mind; the way to do this is to practice Liber Resh vel Helios, sub figura CC, pp. 425 - 426 - Magick. There is another version of these Adorations, slightly fuller; but those in the text are quite al - right. The important thing is not to forget. I shall have to teach you the signs and gestures which go with the words. It is also desirable before beginning a formal meal to go through the fol - lowing dialogue: Knock 3 - 5 - 3: say, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 8 of the Law.\" The person at the other end of the table replies: \"What is thy Will?\" You: \"It is my Will to eat and drink.\" He: \"To what end?\" You: \"That my body may be fortified thereby.\" He: \"To what end?\" You: \"That I may accomplish the Great Work.\" He: \"Love is the law, love under will.\" You, with a single knock: \"Fall to.\" When alone make a monologue of it: thus, Knock 3 - 5 - 3. Do what, etc. It is my Will to, etc., that my body, etc., that I may, etc., Love is, etc. Knock: and begin to eat. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of performing these small ceremonies regularly, and being as nearly accurate as possible with regard to the times. You must not mind stopping in the middle of a crowded thor - oughfare --- lorries or no lorries --- and saying the Adorations; and you must not mind snubbing your guest --- or your host --- if he or she should prove ig - norant of his or her share of the dialogue. It is perhaps because these matters are so petty and trivial in appearance that they afford so excellent a training. They teach you concentration, mindfulness, moral and social courage, and a host of other virtues. Like a perfect lady, I have kept the tit bit to the last. It is absolutely essential to begin a magical diary, and keep it up daily. You begin by an account of your life, going back even before your birth to your ancestry. In conformity with the practice which you may perhaps choose to adopt later, given in Liber Thisarb, sub figura CMXIII, paragraphs 27 - 28, Magick, pp. 420 - 422, you must find an answer to the question: \"How did I come to be in this place at this time, engaged in this particular work?\" As you will see from the book, this will start you on the discovery of who you really are, and eventually lead you to your recovering the memory o f pre - vious incarnations. As it is difficult for you to come to Town except at rare and irregular"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 9 intervals, may I suggest a plan which has previously proved very useful, and that is a weekly letter. Eliphas Lâvi did this with the Baron Spedalieri, and the correspondence is one of the most interesting of his works. you ask such questions as you wish to have answered, and I answer them to the best of my ability. I, of course, add spontaneous remarks which may be elicited by my observations on your progr ess and the perusal of your magi - cal diary. This, of course, should be written on one side of the paper only, so that the opposite page is free for comments, and an arrangement should be made for it to be inspected at regular intervals.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally, 7   666  Letter No. B   April 20, 19 43 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law I was very glad to have your letter, and am very sorry to hear that you have been in affliction. About the delay, however, I think I ought to tell you that the original Rule of t he Order of A.'. A.'. was that the introducer read over a short lection to the applicant, then left him alone for a quar - ter of an hour, and on coming back received a \"yes\" or \"no.\" If there was any hesitation about it the applicant was barred for life. The reason for the relaxation of the rule was that it was thought better"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 10 to help people along in the early stages of the work, even if there was no hope of their turning out first - class. But I should like you to realize that sooner or later, whether in t his incarnation or another, it is put up to you to show perfect courage in face of the completely unknown, and the power of rapid and irrevocable decision without without counting the cost. I think that it is altogether wrong to allow yourself to be worri ed by \"psychological, moral, and artistic problems.\" It is no good your starting anything of any kind unless you can see clearly into the simplicity of truth. All this humming and hawing about things is moral poison. What is the use of being a woman if you have not got an intuition, an instinct en - abling you to distinguish between the genuine and the sham? Your state of mind suggests to me that you must have been, in the past, under the influence of people who were always talking about things, and neve r doing any real work. They kept on arguing all sorts of obscure phil - osophical points; that is all very well, but when you have succeeded in analyzing your reactions you will understand that all this talk is just an excuse for not doing any serious work . I am confirmed in this judgment by your saying: \"I don't know if I want to enter into a great conflict. I need peace.\" Fortunately you save yourself by adding: \"Real peace, that is living and not stagnant.\" All life is con - flict. Every breath that you draw represents a victory in the struggle of the whole Universe. You can't have peace without perfect mastery of circum - stance; and I take it that this is what you mean by \"living, not stagnant.\" But it is of the first consequence for you to summon up the resolution to stamp on this sea of swirling thoughts by an act of will; you must say: \"Peace be still.\" The moment you have understood these thoughts for what they are, tools of the enemy, invented by him with the idea of preventing"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 11 you from under taking the Great Work --- the moment you dismiss all such con - siderations firmly and decisively, and say: \"What must I do?\" and having discovered that, set to work to do it, allowing of no interruption, you will find that living peace which (as you seem t o see) is a dynamic and not a static condition. (There is quite a lot about this point in Little Essays Toward Truth, and also in The Vision and the Voice.) Your postscript made me smile. It is not a very good advertisement for the 8 kind of peo ple with whom you have been associated in the past. My own posi - tion is a very simple one. I obeyed the injunction to \"buy a perfectly black hen, without haggling.\" I have spent over 100,000 pounds of my in - herited money on this work: and if I had a t housand times that amount to - day it would all go in the same direction. It is only when one is built in this way, to stand entirely aloof from all considerations of twopence halfpenny more or fourpence halfpenny less, that one obtains perfect free - dom o n this Plane of Discs. All the serious Orders of the world, or nearly all, begin by insisting that the aspirant should take a vow of poverty; a Buddhist Bhikku, for example, can own only nine objects - his three robes, begging bowl, a fan, tooth - brush, a nd so on. The Hindu and Mohammedan Orders have similar regulations; and so do all the important Orders of monkhood in Christianity. Our own Order is the only exception of importance; and the reason for this is that it is much more difficult to retain one 's purity if one is living in the world than if one simply cuts oneself off from it. It is far easier"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 12 to achieve technical attainments if one is unhampered by any such considera - tions. These regulations operate as restrictions to one's usefulness in hel ping the world. There are terrible dangers, the worst dangers of all, associated with complete retirement. In my own personal judgment, moreover, I think that our own ideal of a natural life is much more wholesome. When you have found out a little about your past incarnations, you should be able to understand this very clearly and simply.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally,  666  Letter No. C   April 30, 1943 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law Thank you for your long letter of no date, but received two days ago. I am very sorry you are still feeling exhausted. I am not too good myself, for I find this weather very trying. I will answer your various points as best I can. I am arranging to send you the official papers connected with the O.T.O., but the idea that you should meet other members first is quite impossible. Even after affiliation, you would not meet anyone unless it were necessary for you to work in cooperation with them. I am afraid you have still got the idea that the Great Work is a tea - party. Contact with other students only means that you criticize their hats, and then their morals; and I am not going to encourage this. Your work is not anybody else's; and undirected chatter is the worst poisonous element in human society. When you talk of the \"actual record\" of the \"Being called Jesus Christ,\" I don't know what you mean. I am not aware of the existence of any such re -"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 13 cord. I know a great many legends, mostly borrowed from previous legends of a similar character. 9 It would be better for you to get a copy of the Equinox of the Gods and study it. The Great Work is the uniting of opposites. It may mean the uniting of the soul with God, of the microcosm with the macrocosm, of the female with the male, of the ego with the non - ego --- or what not. By \" love under will\" one refers to the fact that the method in every case is love, by which is meant the uniting of opposites as above stated, such as hydrogen and chlorine, sodium and oxygen, and so on. Any reaction what - ever, any phenomenon, is a phenomeno n of \"love\", as you will understand when I come to explain to you the meaning of the word \"point - event\". But love has to be \"under will,\" if it is to be properly directed. You must find your True Will, and make all your actions subservient to the one gre at purpose. Rahoor is the Sun God; Tahuti is the Egyptian Mercury; Kephra is the Sun at midnight. About your problems; what I have to do is to try to teach you to think clearly. You will be immensely stimulated by having all the useless trim - mings stri pped from your thinking apparatus. For instance, I don't think you know the first principles of logic. You apparently take up a more or less Christian attitude, but at the same time you like very much the idea of Karma. You cannot have both. The questi on about money does not arise. This old and very good rule (which"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 14 I have always kept) was really pertinent to the time when there were actual secrets. But I have published openly all the secrets. All I can do is to train you in a perfectly exoteric way. My suggestion about the weekly letter was intended to exclude this question, as you would be getting full commercial value for anything paid. Your questions about the Spirit of the Sun, and so on, are to be answered by experience. Intellectual satisfac tion is worthless. I have to bring you to a state of mind completely superior to the mechanism of the normal mind. A good deal of your letter is rather difficult to answer. You always seem to want to put the cart before the horse. Don't you see that, i f I were trying to get you to do something or other, I should simply return you to the kind of answer which I thought would satisfy you, and make you happy? And this would be very easy to do because you have got no clear ideas a - bout anything. For one th ing, you keep on using terms about whose signifi - cance we are not yet in agreement. When you talk about the \"Christian path,\" do you believe in vicarious atonement and eternal damnation --- or don't you? A great deal of the confusion that arises in all these ques - tions, and grows constantly worse as fellow - students talk them over --- the blind leading the blind --- is because they have no idea of the necessity of defining their terms. Then again, you ask me questions like \"What is purity?\" that can be an - swered in a dozen different ways; and you must understand what is meant by a \"universe of discourse.\" If you asked me --- \"Is this sample of clo - ride of gold a pure sample?\" I can answer you. You must understand the value of precision in speech. I could go on rambling about purity and selflessness for years, and no one would be a penny the better. P.S. --- or rather, I did not want to dictate this bit. --- Your ideas about"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 15 the O.T.O. remind me of some women's idea of shopping. You want to 10 maul about the stock and then walk out with a proud glad smile: NO. Do you really think that I should muster all the most distinguished people alive for your inspection and approval? The affiliation clause in our Constitution is a privilege: a courtesy to a sympathetic body. Were you not a Mason, or Co - Mason, you would have to be proposed and seconded, and then examined by savage Inquisitors; and then --- probably --- thrown out on to the garbage heap. Well, no, it's not as bad as that; but w e certainly don't want anybody who chooses to apply. Would you do it yourself, if you were on the Committee of a Club? The O.T.O. is a serious body, engaged on a work of Cosmic scope. You should question yourself: what can I contribute? Secrets. There is one exception to what I have said about publishing everything: that is, the ultimate secret of the O.T.O. This is really too dangerous to disclose; but the safeguard is that you could not use it if you knew it, unless you were an advanced Adept; and yo u would not be allowed to go so far unless we were satisfied that you were sincerely devoted to the Great Work. (See One Star in Sight). True, the Black Brothers could use it; but they would only destroy themselves.  Love is the law , love under will.

Thanks for your letter. I couldn't find the O.T.O. typescript --- and then it struck me that it would be useful to await your reactions. If I were expecting some presumably important papers by post, I should g et anxious after 24 hours delay (at most) and start enquiries. Anyhow, I can't find them for the moment; but Mr. Bryant said he would lend you his Blue Equinox: pages 195 - 270 give what you require. But the real point of your affiliating is that it saves me from constantly being on my guard lest I should mention something which I am sworn not to reveal. As in every serious society, members are pledged not to disclose what they may have learnt, whom they have met; it is so, even in Co - Mason - ry: isn't it: But one may mention the names of members who have died. (See Liber LII, par. 2.) Be happy then; the late X... Y... was one of us. I hope that he and Rudolph Steiner will (between them) satisfy your doubts. The A.'.A.'. is totally different. One Star in Sight tells you every - thing that you need to know. (Perhaps some of these regulations are hard to grasp: personally, I can never understand all this By - Law stuff. So you must ask me what, and why, and so on.) There is really only one point for your ju dgment. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" You have read Liber LXV and Liber VII; That shows you 11 what states you can attain by this cirriculum. Now read \"A Master of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 17 Temple\" (Blue Equinox, pp. 127 - 170) for an account of the early stag es of training, and their results. (Of course, your path might not coincide with, or even resemble, his path.) But do get it into you head that \"If the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch.\" If you had seen 1% of the mischief that I have seen, you would freeze to the marrow of your bones at the mere idea of seeing another member through the telescope! Well, I employ the figure of hyperbole, that I admit; but it really won't do to have a dozen cooks at the broth! If you're working w ith me, you'll have no time to waste on other people. I fear your \"Christianity\" is like that of most other folk. You pick out one or two of the figures from which the Alexandrines concocted \"Jesus\" (too many cooks, again, with a vengeance!) and neglect the others. The Zionist Christ of Matthew can have no value for you; nor can the Asiatic \"Dying - God\" --- compiled from Melcarth, Mithras, Adonis, Bacchus, Osiris, Attis, Krishna, and others --- who supplied the miraculous and ritualistic elements of the f able. Rightly you ask: \"What can I contribute?\" Answer: One Book. That is the idea of the weekly letter: 52 of yours and 52 of mine, competently edited, would make a most useful volume. This would be your property: so that you get full material value , perhaps much more, for your outlay. I thought of the plan because one such arrangement has recently come to an end, with amazingly happy results: they should lie open to your admiring gaze in a few months from now. Incidentally, I personally get nothin g out of it; secretarial work costs money these days. But there is another great advan - tage; it keeps both of us up to the mark. Also, in such letters a great deal of odds and ends of knowledge turn up automatically; valuable stuff, frequent enough; yes , but one doesn't want to lose the thread, once one starts. Possibly ten days might be best."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 18 But please understand that this suggestion arose solely from your own statement of what you thought would help in your present circumstances. Anyway, as you say, decide! If it is yes, I should like to see you before June 15 when I expect to go away for a few days; better to give you some groundwork to keep you busy in my absence.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally,  666  Letter No. E   Aug. 18, 1943 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Much thought has gone into the construction of your Motto. \"I will become\" can be turned neatly enough as \"Let there be;\" by avoiding the First Pro - noun one gets the idea of \"the absorption of the Self in the Beloved,\" 12 which is exactly what yo u want. \"The creative Force of the Universe\" is quite ready - made. Pyramis1, a pyramid, is that Force in its geometrical form; in its biological form it is Phallus2, the Yang or Lingam. Both words have the same numerical value, 831. These two words can therefore serve you as the secret object of your Work. How than can you construct the number 831? The Letter Kaph3, Jupiter (Jehovah), the Wheel of Fortune in the Tarot ---"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 19 the Atu X is a picture of the Universe built up and revolving by virtue of those Three Principles: Sulphur, Mercury, Salt; or Gunas: Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas --- has the value 20. So also has the letter Yod4 spelt in full. One Gnostic secret way of spelling and pronouncing Jehovah is IAO5 and this has the value 811. So has \"Let there b e,\" Fiat, transliterating into Greek. Resuming all these ideas, it seems that you can express your aspiration very neatly, very fully, by choosing for your motto the words FIAT YOD.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally,  666 P.S. Please study this letter, and these explanatory figures (the author, BAPHOMET XÃ¸ O.T.O., in the original spells each word, giving the numerical equivalent of each let ter in puramis, etc. This is here not copied.) and meditate upon them until you have fully assimilate not only the matter under immediate consideration, but the general method of Qabal - istic research and construction. Note how new cognate ideas arise to enrich the formula.  666  Letter No. F   Aug. 20, 1943 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Le t me begin by referring to my letter about the motto and make clear to you the working of this letter. In this motto you have really got several ideas combined, and yet they are"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 20 really, of course, one idea. Fiat, being 811, is identical with IAO, and the refore FIAT YOD might be read not only as \"let there be\" (or \"Let me become\"), the secret source of all creative energy, but as \"the secret source of the energy of Jehovah.\" The two words together, having the value 1* In the original in Greek 2* In the original in Greek. 3* In the original in Hebrew. 4* In the original in Hebrew. 5* In the original in Greek. 13 of 831, they contain the secret meanings Pyramis and Phallos, which is the same idea in different forms; thus you have three ways of exp ressing the creative form, in its geometrical aspect, its human aspect, and its divine aspect. I am making a point of this, because the working out of this motto should give you a very clear idea of the sort of way in which Qabalah should be used. I thin k it is rather useful to remember what the essence of the Qabalah is in principle; thus, in your correspondence for Malkuth, Yesod, and Hod you are simply writing down some of the ideas which pertain to the numbers 10, 9, and 8 respectively. Naturally, th ere is a great deal of re - dundancy and overloading as soon as you get to ideas important enough to be comprehensive; as is mentioned in the article on the Qabalah in Equi - nox Vol. I, No. 5, it is quite easy to prove 1 = 2 = 3 = 4, etc. On the other hand , you must be careful to avoid taking the correspondences given in the books of reference without thinking out why they are so given. Thus, you find a camel in the number which refers to the Moon, but the Tarot card \"the Moon\" refers not to the letter Gime l which means camel, but to the letter Qoph, and the sign Pisces which means fish, while the letter"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 21 itself refers to the back of the head; and you also find fish has the meaning of the letter Nun. You must not go on from this, and say that the back of you r head is like a camel - the connection between them is simply that they all refer to the same thing. In studying the Qabalah you mention six months; I think after that time you should be able to realize that, after six incarnations of uninterrupted study , you may realize that you can never know it; as Confucius said about the Yi King. \"If a few more years were added to my life, I would devote a hundred of them to the study of the Yi.\" If, however, you work at the Qabalah in the same way as I did myself, in season and out of season, you ought to get a very fair grasp of it in six months. I will now tell you what this method is: as I walked about, I made a point of attributing everything I saw to its appropriate idea. I would walk out of the door of my h ouse and reflect that door is Daleth, and house Beth; now the word \"dob\" is Hebrew for bear, and has the number 6, which refers to the Sun. Then you come to the fence of your property and that is Cheth - number 8, number of Tarot Trump 7, which is the Cha riot: so you begin to look about for your car. Then you come to the street and the first house you see is number 86, and that is Elohim, and it is built of red brick which reminds you of Mars and the Blasted Tower, and so on. As soon as this sort of work, which can be done in a quite lighthearted spirit, becomes habitual, you will find your mind running naturally in this direction, and will be surprised at your progress. Never let your mind wander from the fact that your Qabalah is not my Qabalah; a good many of the things which I have noted may be useful to you, but you must construct your own system so that it is a living weapon in your hand. I think I am fair if I say that the first step on the Qabalah which may be called success, is when you make an a ctual discovery which throws light on"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 22 some problem which has been troubling you. A quarter of a century ago I was in New Orleans, and was very puzzled about my immediate course of action; in fact I may say I was very much distressed. There seemed literal ly no - thing that I could do, so I bethought myself that I had better invoke Mercury. As soon as I got into the appropriate frame of mind, it naturally occurred to me, with a sort of joy, \"But I am Mercury.\" I put it into Latin --- Mercurius sum, and sud denly something struck me, a sort of nameless reaction which said: \"That's not quite right.\" Like a flash it came to me to put 14 it into Greek, which gave me \"Hermes Eimi\", {Keynote: may wish to convert to true Greek} and adding that up rapidly, I got the number 418, with all the marvellous correspondences which had been so abundantly useful to me in the past (See Equ. of the Gods, p. 138). My troubles disappeared like a flash of lightning. Now to answer your questions seriatum; it is quite all right to put ques - tions to me about The Book of the Law; a very extended commentary has been written, but it is not yet published. I shall probably be able to answer any of your questions from the manuscript, but you cannot go on after that when it woul d become a discussion; as they say in the law - courts, \"You must take the witness' answer.\" II. The Qabalah, both Greek and Hebrew, also very likely Arabic, was used by the author of The Book of the Law. I have explained above the proper use of the Qabal ah. I cannot tell you how the early Rosicrucians used it, but I think one may assume that their methods were not dissimilar to our own. Incidentally, it is not very safe to talk about Rosicrucians, because"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 23 their name has become a signal for letting loose the most devastating floods of nonsense. What is really known about the original Rosicrucians is prac - tically confined to the three documents which they issued. The eighteenth century Rosicrucians may, or may not, have been legitimate successors of the original brotherhood - I don't know. But from them the O.T.O. derived its authority; The late O.H.O. Theodor Reuss possessed a certain number of documents which demonstrated the validity of his claim according to him; but I only saw two or three of them, and they were not of very great impor - tance. Unfortunately he died shortly after the last War, and he had got out of touch with some of the other Grand Masters. The documents did not come to me as they should have done; they were seized by his wife who had an idea that she could sell them for a fantastic price; and we did not feel inclined to meet her views. I don't think the matter is of very great importance, the work being done by members of the Order all over the place is to me quite sufficient. I II. The Ruach contains both the moral and intellectual worlds, which is really all that we mean by the conscious mind; perhaps it even includes certain portions of the subconscious. IV. In initiation from the grade of Neophyte to that of Zelator, one pass es by this way. The main work is to obtain admission to, and control of, the astral plane.

Incidentally, most of the Eastern cults fall down when they come West, simply because they make no allowance for our different tempera - ments. Also they set tasks which are completely unsuitable to Europeans - an immense amount of disappointment has been caused by failure to recognize these facts. Your sub - questions a, b, and c are really answered by the above. All the terms you use are very indefinite. I hope it will not take too long to 15 get you out of the way of thinking in these terms. For instance, the word \"initiation\" includes the whole process, and how to distinguish between it and enlightenment I cannot tell you. \"Probation,\" moreover, if it means \"proving,\" continues throughout the entire process. Nothing is worse for the student than to indulge in these mild speculations about ambiguous terms. V. Y ou can, if you like, try to work out a progress of Osiris through Amennti on the Tree of Life, but I doubt whether you will get any satis - factory result. It seems to me that you should confine yourself very closely to the actual work in front of you. At the present moment, of course, this includes a good deal of general study; but my point is that the terms employed in that study should always be capable of precise definition.

In India, by the way, no attempt is ever made to use these vague terms. They always have a very clear idea of what is meant by words like \"Buddhi,\" \"Manas\" and the like. Attempts at tran slation are very unsatisfactory. I find that even with such a simple matter as the \"Eight limbs of Yoga,\" as you will see when you come to read my Eight Lectures. I am very pleased with your illustrations; that is excellent practice for you. Presently y ou have to make talismans, and a Lamen for yourself, and even to devise a seal to serve as what you might call a magical coat - of - arms, and all this sort of thing is very helpful.

Still, yours the gain! 1. That verse (AL. I, 44) condenses the whole ma gical technique. It makes clear --- when you have understood it --- the secret of success in the Great Work. Of course at first it appears a paradox. You must have an aim, and one aim only: yet on no account must you want to achieve it!!! Those chapte rs of the Book of Lies quoted in my last letter6 do throw some light onto this Abyss of self - contradiction; and there is meaning much deeper than the contrast between the Will with a capital W, and desire, want, or velleity. The main point seems to be tha t in aspiring to Power one is limited by the True Will. If you use force, violating your own nature either from lack of understanding or from petulant whim, one is merely wasting energy; things go back to normal as soon as the stress is removed. This is one small case of the big Equation \"Free Will = Necessity\" (Fate, Destiny, or Karma: it's all much the same idea). One is most rigid - ly bound by the causal chain that has dragged one to where one is; but it is one's own self that has forged the links. P lease refrain from the obvious retort: \"Then, in the long run, you can't possibly go wrong: so it doesn't matter what you do.\" Perfectly true, of course! (There is no single grain of dust that shall not attain to Buddha - hood:\" with some such words did the debauched old reprobate seek to console himself when Time began to take its revenge.) But the answer is simple enough: you happen to be the kind of being that thinks it does matter what course you steer; or, still more haughtily, you enjoy the pleasur e of sailing. No, there is this factor in all success: self - confidence. If we analyze"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 29 this, we find that it means that one is aware that all one's mental and physical faculties are working harmoniously. The deadliest and subtlest enemy of that feeling i s anxiety about the result; the finest gauze of doubt is enough to dim one's vision, to throw the entire field out of focus. Hence, even to be aware that there is a result in prospect must militate against that serenity of spirit which is the essence of se lf - confidence. As you will know, all our automatic physiological functions are deranged if one is aware of them. This then, is the difficulty, to enjoy conscious - ly while not disturbing the process involved. The obvious physical case is the sexual act: perhaps its chief importance is just that it is a type of this exceptional spiritual - mental condition. I hope, however, that you will remember what I have said on the subject in paragraphs 15 - 17 of my 3rd Lecture on Yoga for Yellowbellies (pp. 71 - 72); t here is a way of obtaining ecstacy from the most insignificant physiological function. Ob - serve that in transferring the whole consciousness to (say) one's little finger or big toe is not trying to interfere with the normal exercise of sits activities, b ut only to realize what is going on in the organism, the 6* A letter dated Oct. 12, '43 constituted No. 48 in Magick Without Tears and the following chapters from the Book of Lies: - \"Peaches\", \"Pilgrim - Talk\", \"Buttons and Rosettes\", \"The Gun - Barrel and th e Mountaineer\". 18 exquisite pleasure of a function in its normal activity.

Is it too bold to suggest that the gradual merging of all these Ways into an interwoven unity may be taken as one mode of presentation of the Accom - plishmen t of the Great Work itself? At least, I feel fairly satisfied the meditation of them severally and jointly may help you to an answer to your first question. 2. Most people in my experience either cook up a hell - broth of self - induced obstacles to success in Astral traveling, or else shoot forth on the wings of romantic imagination and fool themselves for the rest of their lives in the manner of the Village Idiot. Yours, luckily, is the former trouble. But --- is it plain obstinacy? --- you do not exerci se the sublime Art of Guru - bullying. You should have made one frenzied leap to my dying bed, thrust aside the cohorts of Mourning Archimandrites, and wrung my nose until I made you do it. And you repeatedly insist that it is difficult. It isn't. Is th ere, how - ever, some deep - seated inhibition - a (Freudian) fear of success? Is there some connection with that sense of guilt which is born in all but the very few? But you don't give it a fair chance. There is, I admit, some trick, or knack, about gett ing properly across; a faculty which one acquires (as a rule) quite suddenly and unexpectedly. Rather like mastering some shots at billiards. Practice has taught me how to communicate this to students; only in rare cases does one fail.

The arrogance! How do you know, pray madam? (Dial numbers at random: the results are often surprisingly delightful!) Besides, I didn't ask you to invoke a supersensible (what a word! Meaning?) Being right away, or at any time: that supersensible is getting on my nerves: do you mean \"not in normal circumstances to be ap - prehended by the senses?\" I suppose so. In a word: do fix a convenient season for going on the Astral Plane under my eye: half an hour (with a bit of luck) on not more than four ev enings would put you in a very different frame of mind. You will soon \"feel your feet\" and then \"get your sea - legs\" and then, much sooner than you think \"Afloat in the aethyr, O my God! my God!\". . . . . \"White swan, bear thou ever me up between thy wings !\" 3.

I have"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 32 very little sympathy with Jewish Theology or ritual; but the Qabalah is so handy and congenial that I use it more than almost any --- or all the oth ers together --- for daily use and work. The Egyptian Theogony is the noblest, the most truly magical, the most bound to me (or rather I to it) by some inmost instinct, and by the memory of my incarnation as Ankh - f - n - Khonsu, that I use it (with its Graeco - Phoenician child) for all work of supreme import. Why stamp my vitals, madam! The Abramelin Operation itself turned into this form before I could so much as set to work on it! like the Duchess' baby (excuse this enthusiasm; but you have aroused the Bri tish Lion - Serpent.) Note, please, that the equivalents given in 777 are not always exact. Tahuti is not quite Thoth, still less Hermes; Mercury is a very much more comprehensive idea, but not nearly so exalted: Hanuman hardly at all. Nor is Tetragrammato n IAO, though even etymology asserts the identity. In these matters you must be catholic, eclectic, even syncretic. And you must consider the nature of your work. If I wanted to evoke Taphthartharath, there would be little help indeed from any but the Q abalistic system; for that spirit's precise forms and numbers are not to be found in any other. The converse, however, is not so true. The Qabalah, properly understood, properly treated, is so universal that one can vamp up a ritual to suit almost \"any n ame and form.\" But in such a case one may expect to have to reinforce it by a certain amount of historical, literary, or philosophic study --- and research. 4. Quite right, dear lady, about your incarnation memories acting as a \"Guide to the Way Back.\" Of course, if you \"missed an Egyptian Incarnation,\" you would not be so likely to be a little Martha, worried \"about much serv - ing.\" Don't get surfeited with knowledge, above all things; it is so very"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 33 fascinating, so dreadfully easy; and the danger of be coming a pedant --- \"Deuce take all your pedants! say I.\" Don't \"dry - rot at ease 'till the Judgment Day.\" No, I will NOT recommend a book.

You only make yourself ridiculous by trying to do at 50 what you ought to have done at 15. As you didn't --- tant pis!

Is x an R - ancestor of y if y has every R - hereditary that x has, provided x is a term which has the relation R to something or to which something has the relation R? (Enthusiastic cries of \"Yes, it is!\") He says \" A number is anything which has the number of some class.\" Feel better now? Still, it would be kind of you to go through a page or so with me, and tell me where the shoe pinches.

Here we are! I. DEF INITION: Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will. (Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge. I therefore take \"magical weapons,\" pen, ink, and paper; I write \"incantations\" --- these sentences - -- in the \"magi - cal language\" i.e. that which is understood by people I wish to instruct. I call forth \"spirits\" such as printers, publishers, booksellers, and so forth, and constrain them to conve y my message to those people. The composition and distribution is thus an act of --- MAGICK --- by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will.8) II. POSTULATE: ANY required Change may be effected by application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner through the proper medium to the proper object. (Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid, nitro - hydrochloric and no other, in s ufficient quantity and of adequate strength, and place it, in a vessel which will not break, leak or corrode, in such a manner as"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 38 will not produce undesirable results, with the necessary quantity of Gold, and so forth. Every Change has its own conditions. In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possible in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is theoretically possi ble to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature; and the conditions are covered by the above postulate.) III. THEOREMS: 1. Every intentional act is a Magical Act.9 (Ilustration: See \"Definition\" above .) 2. Every successful act has conformed to the postulate. 3. Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postu - late have not been fulfilled (Illustrations: There may be failure to understand the case; as when a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatment injures his patient. There may be failure to apply the right kind of force, 8* By \"intentional\" I mean \"willed\". But even unintentional acts so seem - ing are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will - to - live. 9* In one sense Magick may be defined as the name given to Science by the vulgar. 23 as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light. There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as when a wrestler h as his hold broken. There may be failure to apply the force in the"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 39 right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of the Bank. There may be failure to employ the correct medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci found his mas terpiece fade away. The force may be applied to an unsuitable object, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut.) 4. The first requisite for causing any change is thorough qualita - tive and quantitative understanding of th e condition. (Illustration: The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of one's own True Will, or of the means by which to fulfill that Will. A man may fancy himself a painter, and waste his life trying to become one; or he may be really a painter, and yet fail to understand and to measure the difficulties peculiar to that career.) 5. The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability to set in right motion the necessary forces. (Illust ration: A banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situa - tion, yet lack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take advantage of it.) 6. \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" That is to say, every human being is int rinsically an independent individual with his own proper character and proper motion. 7. Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on the self, and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each. Anyo ne who is forced from his own course, either through not understanding himself, or through external opposition, comes in - to conflict with the order of the Universe, and suffers accordingly. (Illustration: A man may think it his duty to ac t in a certain way, through having made a fancy picture of himself, instead of investi - gating his actual nature. For example, a woman may make herself"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 40 miserable for life by thinking that she prefers love to social con - sideration, or vice versa. One woman may stay with an unsympathetic husband when she would really be happy in an attic with a lover, while another may fool herself into a romantic elopement when her only true pleasures are those of presiding at fashionabl e functions. Again, a boy's instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parents insist on his becoming a doctor. In such a case, he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in medicine. 8. A man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting his strength. He cannot hope to influence his environment efficiently. (Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in no condi - tion to undertake the invasion of other countries. A man with cancer employs his nourishment alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is part of himself. He soon fails to resist the pressure of his environment. In practical life, a man who is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong wil l do it very clumsily. At first!) 24 9. A man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universe to assist him. (Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that the individual should be true to his o wn nature, and at the same time adapt himself to his environment.) 10.

We may then say that our consciousness is ca usally connected with the re - motest galaxies; yet we do not know even how it arises from --- or with --- the molecular changes in the brain.) 11. Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by the empirical applic ation of certain principles whose interplay involves different orders of idea, connected with each other in a way beyond our present comprehension. (Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule - of - thumb methods. We do not know wh at consciousness is, or how it is connected with muscular action; what electricity is or how it is connected with the machines that generate it; and our methods depend on calcula - tions involving mathematical ideas which have no corresponden ce in the Universe as we know it.10) 12. Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his idea of his limitations is based on experience of the past. and every step in his progress extends his empire. There is, ther e - fore, no reason to assign theoretical limits11 to what he may be, or to what he may do. (Illustration: Two generations ago it was supposed theoretically impossible that man should ever know the chemical composition of the fixe d stars.

As Tyndall said, man might at any moment learn to per - ceive and utilize vibrations of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds. The qu estion of Magick is a question of discovering and em - ploying hitherto unknown forces in nature. We know that they exist, and we cannot doubt the possibility of mental or physical instru - ments capable of bringing us in relation with them.) 13. Every man is more or less aware that his individuality comprises several orders of existence, even when he maintains that his subtler principles are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle. A similar order may be as sumed to extend throughout nature. 10* For instance, \"irrational,\" \"unreal,\" and \"infinite\" expressions. 11* i.e. except --- possibly --- in the case of logically absurd questions, such as the schoolmen discussed in connection with \"God.\" 25 (Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of toothache with the decay which causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain physical forces, such as electrical and thermal conductivity; but neither in us nor in them --- so far as we know --- is there any direct conscious perception of these forces. Imperceptible influences are therefore associated with all material phenomena; and there is no reason why we should not work upon matter through those subtle ener - gies as we do through their material bases. In fact, we use magnetic force to move iron, and solar radiation to reproduce images.) "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 43 14. Man is capable of being, and using, anything which he perceives; for everything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being. He may thus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is con - scious to his individual Will. (Illustration: Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personal conduct, to obtain power over his fe llows, to excuse his crimes, and for innumerable other purposes, including that of realizing himself as God. He has used the irrational and unreal conceptions of mathe - matics to help him in the construction of mechanical devices. He has used his moral force to influence the actions even of wild ani - mals. He has employed poetic genius for political purposes.) 15. Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into any other kind of force by using suitable means. There is thus an inexhaustible supply of any particular kind of force that we may need. (Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and power by using it to drive dynamos. The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by so ordering them in speech as to inflame war - like passions. The hallucinations connected with the mysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species.) 16. The application of any given force affects all the ord ers of being which exist in the object to which it is applied, whichever of those orders is directly affected. (Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not his body only, is affected by my act; although the d agger, as such, has no direct relation therewith. Similarly, the power of my thought may so work on the mind of another person as to produce far - reaching physical changes in him, or in others through him.)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 44 17. A man may learn to use any force so as to serve any purpose, by taking advantage of the above theorems. (Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his speech, by using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedly utters a chosen word. He may serve the same purpose by resolving that every incident of his life shall remind him of a particular thing, Making every impression the starting point of a connected series of thoughts ending in that thing. He might also devote his w hole energies to some particular object, by resolving to do nothing at variance therewith, and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.) 18. He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by making himself a fit rec eptacle for it, establishing a connection with it, 26 and arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flow to - ward him. (Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a place where there is undergroun d water; I prevent it from leaking away; and I arrange to take advantage of water's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.) 19. Man's sense of himself as separate from, and opposed to, the Universe is a bar to his conduct ing its currents. It insulates him. (Illustration: A popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself, and remembers only \"The Cause.\" Self - seeking engenders"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 45 jealousies and schism.

Yet even in this case self - assertion bears witness to its. dissatisfaction with itself, since in cann ot fulfill its function until completed by its counterpart in another organism.) 20. Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he is really fitted. (Illustration: You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. A tru e man of science learns from every phenomenon. But Nature is dumb to the hypocrite; for in her there is nothing false12.) 21. There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man with the Universe in essence; for as soon as man make s himself one with any idea, the means of measurement cease to exist. But his power to utilize that force is limited by his mental power and capacity, and by the circumstances of his human environment. (Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes, to him, nothing but love boundless and immanent; but his mystical state is not contagious; his fellow - men are either amused or an - noyed. He can only extend to others the effect which his love has had upon himself by means of his mental and physical qualities. Thus, Catullus, Dante, and Swinburne made their love a mighty mover of mankind by virtue of their power to put their thoughts on the subject in musical and eloquent language. Agai n, Cleopatra and other people in authority moulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence their political actions. The Magician, however well he succeeds in making contact with the secret sources"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 46 of energy in n ature, can only use them to the extent permitted by his intellectual and moral qualities. Mohammed's intercourse with Gabriel was only effective because of his statesmanship, soldier - ship, and the sublimity of his command of Arabic. Hertz '; discovery of the rays which we now use for wireless telegraphy was sterile until reflected through the minds and wills of the people who could take his truth, and transmit it to the world of action by means of mechanical and economic instruments.) 12* It is no objection that the hypocrite is himself part of Nature. He is an \"endothermic\" product, divided against himself, with a tendency to break up. He will see his own qualities everywhere, and thus obtain a radical misconception of phenomena. Most religions of the past have failed by expecting Nature to conform with their ideals of proper conduct. 27 22. Every individual is essentially sufficient to himself. But he is unsatisfactory to himself until he has esta blished himself in his right relation with the Universe. (Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, is useless in the hands of savages. A poet, however sublime, must impose himself upon his generation if he is to enjoy (and even t o understand) himself, as theoretically should be the case.) 23. Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one's condi - tions. It is the Art of applying that understanding in action. (Illustration: A golf club is intended t o move a special ball in a"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 47 special way in special circumstances. A Niblick should rarely be used on the tee, or a Brassie under the bank of a bunker. But, also, the use of any club demands skill and experience.). 24. Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is. (Illustration: To insist that anyone else shall comply with one's own standards is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, since both parties are equally born of necessity.) 25. Every man must do Magick each time that he acts or even thinks, since a thought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action, thought it may not do so at the time. (Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man's own body and in the air around him: it disturbs the balance of the entire universe and its effects continue eternally throughout all space. Every thought, however swiftly suppressed, has its effect on the mind. It stands as one of the causes of every s ubsequent thought, and tends to influence every subsequent action. A golfer may lose a few yards on his drive, a few more with his second and third, he may lie on the green six bare inches too far from the hole; but the net result of t hese trifling mishaps is the difference of a whole stroke, and so probably between having and losing the hole.) 26. Every man has a right, the right of self - preservation, to ful - fill himself to the utmost.13. (Illustration: A functi on imperfectly performed injures, not only itself, but everything associated with it. If the heart is afraid to beat for fear of disturbing the liver, the liver is starved for blood, and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting digestion, w hich disorders respiration, on which cardiac welfare depends.) "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 48 27. Every man should make Magick the keynote of his life. He should learn its laws and live by them. (Illustration: The Banker should discover the real meaning of his existence, the real motive which led him to choose that profession. He should understand banking as a necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind, instead of as merely a business whose objects 13* Men of \"criminal nature\" are simply at issue with their true Wills. The murderer has the Will - to - live; and his will to murder is a false will at variance with his true Will, since he risks death at the hands of Society by obeying his criminal impulse. 28 are independent of the general welfare. He should learn to distin - guish false values from real, and to act not on accidental fluctua - tions but on considerations of essential importance. Such a banker will prove himself superior to others; because he will not b e an individual limited by transitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and eternal as gravitation, as patient and irresistible as the tides. His system will not be subject to panic, any more than the law of Inver se Squares is disturbed by Elections. He will not be anxious about his affairs because they will not be his; and for that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, clear - headed confidence of an onlooker, with intelligence un - clouded by self - interest and power unimpaired by passion.) 28. Every man has a right to fulfill his own will without being afraid that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 49 his proper path, it is the fault of others if they interfere with him. (Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to control Europe, he should not be blamed for exercising his rights. To oppose him would be an error. Anyone so doing would have mad e a mistake as to his own destiny, except in so far as it might be necessary for him to learn the lessons of defeat. The sun moves in space without interference. The order of Nature provides a orbit for each star. A clash proves that one o r the other has strayed from its course. But as to each man that keeps his true course, the more firmly he acts, the less likely are others to get in his way. His example will help them to find their own paths and pursue them. Every man that becomes a Magician helps others to do likewise. The more firmly and surely men move, and the more such action is accepted as the standard of morality, the less will conflict and confusion hamper humanity.) Well, here endeth the Fi rst Lesson. That seems to me to cover the ground fairly well; at least, that is what I have to say when serious analysis is on the agenda. But there is a restricted and conventional sense in which the word may be used without straying too far from the ab ove philosophical position. One might say: - \"Magick is the study and use of those forms of energy which are (a) subtler than the ordinary physical - mechanical types, (b) accessible only to those who are (in one sense or another) 'Initiates'.\" I fear tha t this may sound rather obscurum per obscurius; but this is one of these cases --- we are likely to encounter many such in the course of our researches --- in which we understand, quite well enough for all practical purposes,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 50 what we mean, but which elude us more and more successfully the more accurately we struggle to define their import. We might fare even worse if we tried to clear things up by making lists of events in history, tradition, or experience and classifying this as being, and that as not bei ng, true Magick. The borderland cases would confuse and mislead us. But --- since I have mentioned history --- I think it might help, if I went straight on to the latter part of your question, and gave you a brief 29 sketch of Magick past, presen t and future as it is seen from the inside. What are the principles of the \"Masters\"? What are They trying to do? What have They done in the past? What means do They employ? As it happens, I have by me a sketch written by M. Gerard Aumont of Tunis some twenty years ago, which covers this subject with reasonable adequacy. I have been at the pains of translating it from his French, I hope not too much reminiscent of the old traduttore, traditore. I will revise it, divide it (like Gaul) into Three Parts a nd send it along.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally,  666 CHAPTER II  THE NECESSITY OF MAGICK FOR ALL Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 51 Right glad am I to hear that you have been so thoroughly satisfied with my explanation of what Magick is, and on what its theories rest. It is good, too, hearing how much you were interested in the glimp se that you have had of some of its work in the world; more, that you grasped the fact that this apparently recondite and irrelevant information has an immediate bearing on your personal life of today. Still, I was not sur - prised that you should add: \"Bu t why should I make a special study of, and devote my time and energy to acquiring proficiency in, the Science and Art of Magick? Ah, well then, perhaps you have not understood my remarks at one of our earliest interviews as perfectly as you suppose! For the crucial point of my exposition was that Magick is not a matter extraneous to the main current of your life, as music, gardening, or collection jade might be. No, every act of your life is a magical act; whenever from ignorance, carelessness, clumsines s or what not, you come short of perfect artistic success, you inevitably register failure, discomfort, frustration. Luck - ily for all of us, most of the acts essential to continued life are in - voluntary; the \"unconscious\" has become so used to doing its \"True Will\" that there is no need of interference; when such need arises, we call it disease, and seek to restore the machine to free spontaneous fulfillment of its function. But this is only part of the story. As things are, we have all adventured into an Universe of immeasurable, of incalculable, possibilities, of situ - ations never contemplated by the trend of Evolution. Man is a marine monster; when he decided that it would be better for him somehow to live on land, he had to grow lungs instead of g ills. When we want to travel over soft snow, we have to invent ski; when we wish to exchange thoughts, we must arrange a conventional code of sounds, of knots in string, of"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 52 carved or written characters --- in a word --- embark upon the boundless ocean of hieroglyphics or symbols of one sort or another. (Presently I shall have to explain the supreme importance of such systems; in fact, the Universe itself is not, and cannot be, anything but an arrangement of 30 symbolic characters!) Here we are, t hen, caught in a net of circumstances; if we are to do anything at all beyond automatic vegetative living, we must consciously apply ourselves to Magick, \"the Science and Art\" (let me remind you!) \"of causing change to occur in conformity with the Will.\" Observe that the least slackness or error means that things happen which do not thus con - form; when this is so despite our efforts, we are (temporarily) baffled; when it is our own ignorance of what we ought to will, or lack of skill in adapting our means to the right end, then we set up a conflict in our own Nature: our act is suicidal. Such interior struggle is at the base of nearly all neuroses, as Freud recently \"discovered\" --- as if this had not been taught, and taught without his massed errors, by the great teachers of the past! The Taoist doctrine, in particular, is most pre - cise and most emphatic on this point; indeed, it may seem to some of us to overshoot the mark; for nothing is permissible in that scheme but frictionless adjustment and adapt ation to circumstance. \"Benevolence and righteousness\" are actually deprecated! That any such ideas should ever have existed (says Lao - tse) is merely evidence of the universal disorder. Taoist sectaries appear to assume that Perfection consists in the ab sence of any disturbance of the Stream of Nescience; and this is very much like"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 53 the Buddhist idea of Nibbana. We who accept the Law of Thelema, even should we concur in this doctrine theoretically, cannot admit that in practice the plan would work out; ou r aim is that our Nothing, ideally perfect as it is in itself, should enjoy itself through realizing itself in the fulfillment of all possibilities. All such phenomena or \"point - events\" are equally \"illusion\"; Nothing is always Nothing; but the projection of Nothing on this screen of the phen - omenal does not only explain, but constitutes, the Universe. It is the only system which reconciles all the contradictions inherent in Thought, and in Experience; for in it \"Reality\" is \"Illusion\", \"Free - will\" is \"De stiny\", the \"Self\" is the \"Not - Self\"; and so for every puzzle of Philosophy. Not too bad an analogy is an endless piece of string. Like a driving band, you cannot tie a knot in it; all the complexities you can contrive are \"Tom Fool\" knots, and unravel a t the proper touch. Always either Naught or Two! But every new re - arrangement throws further light on the possible tangles, that is, on the Nature of the String itself. It is always \"Nothing\" when you pull it out; but becomes \"Everything\" as you play ab out with it,14 since there is no limit to the combinations that you can form from it, save only in your imagination (where the whole thing belongs!) and that grows mightily with Experience. It is accordingly well worth while to fulfill oneself in every c onceivable manner. It is then (you will say) impossible to \"do wrong\", since all phenomena are equally \"Illusion\" and the answer is always \"Nothing\". In theory one can hardly deny this proposition; but in practice --- how shall I put it? \"The state of Il lusion which for convenience I call my present conscious - ness is such that the course of action A is more natural to me that the course of action B?\" "},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 54 Or: A is a shorter cut to Nothing; A is less likely to create internal conflict. 14* N Ã± N = Two or Naug ht; one is the Magical, the other the mystical, process.

Now then, what bothers me it this: Have I or have I not explained this matter of \"Magick\" - \"Why should I (who have only just heard of it, at ;east as a serious subject of study) acquire a knowledge of its principles, and of the powers conferred by its mastery?\" Must I bribe you with pro - mises of health, wealth, power over others, knowledge, thaumaturgical skill, success in every worldly ambition - as I could quite honestly do?

Surely the subject is difficult enough in any case --- must you put on a mask to make it clear? I know you well enough by now to be sure that you will not fob me off with any Holy - Willie non sense about the ineffable, about human language being inadequate to reveal such Mysteries, about the necessity of constructing a new language to explain a new system of thought; of course I know that this had to be done in the case of chemistry, of higher mathematics, indeed of almost all technical sub - jects; but I feel that you have some other, deeper explanation in reserve. After all, most of what I am seeking to learn from you has been familiar to many of the great minds of humanity for many centuries. Indeed, the Qabalah is a special language, and that is old enough; there is not much new material to fit into that structure. But why did they, in the first place, resort to this symbolic jargon?\" You put it very well; and when I think it over, I feel f ar from sure that the explanation which I am about to inflict upon you will satisfy you, or even whether it will hold water! In the last resort, I shall have to maintain that we are justified by experience, by the empirical success in communicating though t which has attended, and continues to attend, our endeavors. But to give a complete answer, I shall have to go back to the beginning, and restate the original problem; and I beg that you will not suppose that I am evading the question, or adopting the Ir ish method of answer - ing it by another, though I know it may sound as if I were. Let me set out by restating our original problem; what we want is Truth; we want an even closer approach to Reality; and we want to discover and discuss the proper means of achieving this object. Very good; let us start by the simplest of all possible enquiries --- and the most difficult --- \"What is anything?\" \"What do we know?\" and other questions that spring naturally from these."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 57 I see a tree.. I hear it --- rustling or creaking in the wind. I touch it --- hard. I smell it --- acrid. I taste it --- bitter. Now all the information given by these five senses has to be put together, although no two agree in any sort of way. The logic by which we build up our complex idea of a tree has more holes than a sponge. But this is to jump far ahead: we must first analyze the single, simple impression. \"I see a tree.\" This phenomenon is what is called a \"point - event.\" It is the coming together of the t wo, the seer and the seen. It is single and simple; yet we cannot conceive of either of them as any - thing but complex. And the Point - Event tells us nothing whatever about either; both, as Herbert Spencer and God knows how many others have shown, unknowa ble; it stands by itself, alone and aloof. It has happened; it is undeniably Reality. Yet we cannot confirm it; for it can never happen again precisely the same. What is even more bewildering is that since it takes time for the eye to convey an impressi on to the conscious - ness (it may alter in 1,000 ways in the process!) all that really exists is a memory of the Point - Event. not the Point - Event itself. what then is this Reality of which we are so sure? Obviously, it has not got a name, since it never happened before, or can happen again! To discuss it at 33 all we must invent a name, and this name (like all names) cannot possibly be anything more than a symbol. Even so, as so often pointed out, all we do is to \"record the behaviour"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 58 of our ins truments.\" Nor are we much better off when we've done it; for our symbol, referring as it does to a phenomenon unique in itself, and not to be apprehended by another, can mean nothing to one's neighbors. What happens, of course, is that similar, though no t identical, Point - Events happen to many of us, and so we are able to construct a symbolic language. My memory of the mysterious Reality resembles yours suffi - ciently to induce us to agree that both belong to the same class. But let me furthermore ask you to reflect on the formation of language itself. Except in the case of onomato - poetic words and a few others, there is no logical connection between a thing and the sound of our name for it. \"Bow - wow\" is a more rational name than \"dog\", which is a mer e convention agreed on by the English, while other nations prefer chien, hund, cane, kalb, kutta and so on. All symbols, you see, my dear child, and it's no good your kicking! But it doesn't stop there. When we try to convey thought by writing, we are b ound to sit down solidly, and construct a holy Qabalah out of nothing. Why would a curve open to the right, sound like the ocean, open at the top, like you? And all these arbitrary symbolic letters are combined by just as symbolic and arbitrary devices to take on conventional meanings, these words again combined into phrases by no less high - handed a proce - dure. And then folk wonder how it is that there should be error and misunder - standing in the transmission of thought from one person to another! Rathe r regard it as a miraculous intervention of Providence when even one of even the simplest ideas \"gets across.\" Now then, this being so, it is evidently good sense to construct one's own alphabet, with one's own very precise definitions, in order to handle an abstruse and techni - cal subject like Magick. The \"ordinary\" words such as God, self, soul,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 59 spirit and the rest have been used so many thousand times in so many thousand ways, usually by writers who knew not, or cared not for the necessity of definiti on that to use them to - day in any scientific essay is almost ludicrous.

But our Magical Alphabet is primarily not letters, but figures, not sounds"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 60 but mathematical ideas. Sir Humphrey Davy16, coming out of his famous illumination (with some help from Nitrous Oxide he got in) exclaimed: The Universe is composed solely of ideas. We, analyzing this a little, say: The Universe is a mathematical expression. Sir James Jeans might have said this, only his banker advised him to cash in on God. The simplest form of this expression is 0 = 2, elsewhere expounded at great length. This 2 might itself be expressed in an indefin - itely great number of ways. Every prime number, including some not in the series of \"natural numbers\", is an individual. The other nu mbers with perhaps a few exceptions (e.g. 41817) are composed of their primes. Each of these ideas may be explained, investigated, understood, by means very various. Firstly, the Hebrew, Greek and Arabic numbers are also letters. Then, each of these let ters is further described by one of the (arbitrarily composed) \"elements of Nature;\" the Four (or Five) Elements, the Seven (or Ten) Planets, and the Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. All these are arranged in a geometrical design composed of ten \"Sephiroth\" (n umbers) and twenty - two \"paths\" joining them; this is called the Tree of Life. Every idea soever can be, and should be, attributed to one or more of these primary symbols; thus green, in different shades, is a quality or function of Venus, the Earth, the S ea, Libra, and others. So also abstract ideas; dishonesty means \"an afflicted Mercury,\" generosity a good, though not always strong, Jupiter; and so on.

Let me direct your spiritual attention to AL I, 54; I, 56; II, 54 - 55; II, 76; III, 47. Now there was enough comprehensible at the time to assure me that the Author of the Book knew at least as much Qabalah as I did: I discovered subsequently more than enough to make it certain without error that he knew a very great deal more, and that of an altogether higher order, than I knew; finally, such glimmerings of light as time and desperate study have thrown on many other obscure passages, to leave no doubt whatever in my mind that he is indeed the supreme Qabalist of all time . . . . \"I asked you how to work it.\" Don't be so peevish, querulous, and impatient; your zeal is laudable, but it's wasting your own time to hurry me.

Every word you come across, add it up, stick it down against that number in a book kept for the purpose. That may seem tedious and silly; why should y ou do all over again the work that I have already done for you? Reason: simple. Doing it will teach you Qabalah as nothing else could. Besides, you won't be all cluttered up with words that mean nothing to you; and if it should happen that you want a wo rd to explain some particular number, you can look it up in my Sepher Sephiroth. By this method, too, you may strike a rich vein of words of your own that I have altogether missed. No doubt, a Really Great Teacher would have said: \"Beware! Use my Dictio nary, and mine alone! All others are spurious!\" But then I'm not a R.G.T. of that kind. For a start, of course, you should put down the words that are bound to come in your way in any case: numbers like 11, 13, 31, 37, and their multiples; the names of God and the principal angels; the planetary and geomantic names; and your own private and particular name with its branches. After that, let your work on the Astral Plane guide you. When investigating the name and other words communicated to you by such b eings as you meet there, or invoke, many more will come up in their proper connections. Very soon you will have quite a nice little Sepher Sephiroth of your very own. Remember to aim, above all things, at coherence.

I ask myself why. It is exceedingly strange, because every time I think of the Equa - tion, I am thrilled with a keen glow of satisfaction that this sempiternal Riddle of the Sphinx should have been answered at last. So then let me now give myself the delight, and you the comfort, of stat - ing the problem from its beginning, and proving the soundness of the solution --- of showing that the contradiction of this Equation is unthink - able. --- --- Are you ready? Forwar d! Paddle! A. We are aware. B. We cannot doubt the existence (whether \"real\" or \"illusory\" makes no difference) of something, because doubt itself is a form of awareness. C. We lump together all that of which we are aware under the convenient name of \" Existence\", or \"The Universe\". Cosmos is not so good for this purpose; that word implies \"order\", which in the present stage of our argument, is a mere assumption. D. We also tend to think of the Universe as containing things of which we are not aware; b ut this is altogether unjustifiable, although it is difficult to think at all without making some such assumption. For 18* See Crowley, Collected Works. 38 instance, one may come upon a new branch of knowledge --- say, histology or Hammurabi or t he language of the Iroquois or the poems of the Herma - phrodite of Panormita.

Then again, does a thing cease to exist if we forget it? The answer is that one cannot be sure. Personally, I feel convinced of the existence of an Universe outside my own immediate awareness; but it is true, even so, that it does not exist for me unless and until it takes its place as part of my consciousness. E. All this paragrpah D is in the nature of a digression, for what you may think of it does not at all touch the argument of this letter. But it had to be put in, just to prevent your mind from raising irrelevant objections. Let me continue, then, from C. F. Something is19. This something appears incalculably vast and complex. How did it come to be? This, briefly, is the \"Riddle of the Universe,\" which has b een always the first preoccupation of all serious philosophers since men began to think at all. G. The orthodox idiot answer, usually wrapped up in obscure terms in the hope of concealing from the enquirer the fact that it is not an answer at all, but an evasion, is: God created it. Then, obviously, who created God? Sometimes we have a Demiurge, a creative God behind whom is an eternal formless Greatness --- anything to confuse the issue! Sometimes the Universe is supported by an elephant; he, in turn, stands on a tortoise . . . by that time it is hoped that the enquirer is too tired and muddled to ask what holds up the tortoise. Sometimes, a great Father and Mother crystallize out of some huge cloudy confusion of \"Elements\" - and so on.

It has of necessity been divided into these schools: the Nihilist, the Monist, and the Dualist. I. The last of these is, on the surface, the most plausible; for almost the first thing that we notice on inspecting the Universe is what the Hindu schools call \"the Pairs of Opposites.\" This too, is very convenient, because it lends itself so readily to ortho - dox theology; so we have Ormuzd and Ahriman, the Devas and the Asuras, Osiris and Set, et cetera and da capo, personifications of \"Good\" and \"Evil.\" The foes may be fairly matched; but more often the tale tells of a revol t in heaven. In this case, \"Evil\" is temporary; soon, espe - cially with the financial help of the devout, the \"devil\" will be \"cast into the Bottomless Pit\" and \"the Saints will reign with Christ in glory 19* You must read The Soldier an The Hunchback: ! and ? in the Equinox I, 1. 39 for ever and ever, Amen!\" Often a \"redeemer,\" a \"dying God,\" is needed to secure victory to Omnipotence; and this is usually what little vulgar boys might call a \"touching story!\" J. The Monist (or Advaitist) school , is at once subtler and more refined; it seems to approach the ultimate reality (as opposed to the superficial examination of the Dualists) more closely. It seems to me that this doctrine is based upon a sorites of doubtful validity. To tell you the hid eously shameful truth, I hate this doc - trine so rabidly that I can hardly trust myself to present it fairly!"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 69 But I will try. Meanwhile, you can study it in the Upanishads, in the Bhagavad - Gita, in Ernst Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe, and dozens of other classics. The dogma appears to excite its dupes to dithyrambs. I have to admit the \"poetry\" of the idea; but there is something in me which vehemently rejects it with excruciating and vin - dictive violence. Possibly, this is because part of our o wn system runs parallel with the first equations of theirs. K. The Monists perceive quite clearly and correctly that it is absurd to answer the question \"How came these Many things (of which we are aware) to be?\" by saying that they came from Many; and \"M any\" in this connec - tion includes Two. The Universe must therefore be a single phenomenon: make it eternal and all the rest of it --- i.e. remove all limit of any kind --- and the Universe explains itself. How then can Opposites exist, as we observe the m to do? Is it not the very essence of our original Sorites that the Many must be reducible to the One? They see how awk - ward this is; so the \"devil\" of the Dualist is emulsified and evaporated into \"illusion;\" what they call \"Maya\" or some equivalent t erm. \"Reality\" for them consists solely of Brahman, the supreme Being \"without quantity or quality.\" They are compelled to deny him all attributes, even that of Existence; for to do so would instantly limit them, and so hurl them headlong back in to Dual ism. All that of which we are aware must obviously possess limits, or it could have no intelligible meaning for us; if we want \"pork,\" we must specify its qualities and quantities; at the very least, we must be able to distinguish it from \"that - which - is - not - pork.\" But - one moment, please! L. There is in Advaitism a most fascinating danger; that is that, up to a certain point, \"Religious Experience\" tends to support this theory."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 70 A word on this. Vulgar minds, such as are happy with a personal God, Vish nu, Jesus, Melcarth, Mithras, or another, often excite themselves - call it \"Energized Enthusiasm\" if you want to be sarcastic! --- to the point of experiencing actual Visions of the objects of their devotion. But these people have not so much as asked the mselves the original question of \"How come?\" which is our present subject. Sweep them into the discard! M. Beyond Vishvarupadarshana, the vision of the Form of Vishnu, beyond that yet loftier vision which corresponds in Hindu classification to our \"Knowl edge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\", is that called Atmadarshana, the vision (or apprehension, a much better word) of the Universe as a single phenomenon, outside all limitations, whether of time, space, causality, or what not. 40 Ve ry good, then! Here we are with direct realization of the Advaitist theory of the Universe. Everything fits perfectly. Also, when I say \"realization,\" I want you to understand that I mean what I say in a sense so intense and so absolute that it is impos sible to convey my meaning to anyone who has not undergone that experience20. How do we judge the \"reality\" of an ordinary impression upon conscious - ness? Chiefly by its intensity, but its persistence, by the fact that nobody can argue us out of our bel ief in it. As people said of Berkeley's 'Idealism' - \"his arguments are irrefutable but they fail to carry con - viction.\" No sceptical, no idealist queries can persuade us that a kick"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 71 in the pants is not 'real' in any reasonable sense of the word. More - over memory reassures us. However vivid a dream may be at the time, however it may persist throughout the years (though it is rare for any dream, unless frequently repeated, or linked to waking impressions by some happy conjunction of circumstances, to r emain long in the mind with any clear - cut vision) it is hardly ever mistaken for an event of actual life. Good: then, as waking life is to dream, so --- yes, more so! --- is Religious Experience as above described to that life common to all of us. It is not merely easy, it is natural, not merely natural, but inevi - table, for anyone who has experienced \"Samadhi\" (this word conveniently groups the higher types of vision21) to regard normal life as \"illusion\" by comparison with this state in which all probl ems are resolved, all doubts driven out, all limitations abolished. But even beyond Atmadarshana comes the experience called Sivadarshana22, in which this Atman (or Brahman), this limit - destroying Universe, is itself abolished and annihilated. (And, with its occurrence, smash goes the whole of the Advaitist theory!) It is a commonplace to say that no words can describe this final destruc - tion. Such is the fact; and there is nothing one can do about it but put it down boldly as I have done above. It do es not matter to our present purpose; all that we need to know is that the strongest prop of the Monist structure has broken off short. Moreover, is it really adequate to postulate an origin of the Universe, as they inevitably do? Merely to deny that the re ever was a beginning by saying that this \"one\" is eternal fails to satisfy me. What is very much worse, I cannot see that to call Evil \"illusion\" helps us at all.

N. It has taken a long while to clear the ground. That I did not expect; the above propositions are so familiar to me, they run so cleanly through my mind, that, until I came to set them down in order, I had no idea what a long and difficult business it all was. Still, it's a long lane, etc. We have seen that \"Two\" (or \"Many\") are 20* I have discussed this and the following points very fully in Book 4 Part I, pp. 63 - 89 21* \"V ision\" is a dreadfully bad word for it; \"trance\" is better, but idiots always mix it up with hypnotism. 22** Possibly almost identical with the Buddhist Neroda - Samapatti. 41 unsatisfactory as origin, if only because they can always be reduced to \"O ne\"; and \"One\" itself is no better, because, among other things, it finds itself forced to deny the very premises on which it was founded. Shall we be any better off if we assume that \"Ex nihilo nihil fit\" is a falsehood, that the origin of All Things is Nothing? Let us see! O. Shall we first glance at the mathematical aspect of Nothing? (Including its identical equation in Logic.) This I worked out so long ago as 1902 e.g. in Berashith, which you will find reprinted in The Sword of Song, and in my Co llected Works, Vol. I. The argument may be summarized as follows. When, in the ordinary way of business, we write 0, we should really write 0n23. For 0 implies that the subject is not extended in any dimen - sion under discussion. Thus a line may be two feet in length, but in"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 73 breadth and depth the coefficient is Zero. We could describe it as 2f + 0b + 0d, or n2f + 0b + 0d. What I proposed in considering \"What do we mean by Nothing?\" was to consider every possible quality of any object as a dimension. F or instance, one might describe this page as being nf + n'b + n\"d + 0 redness + ) 0 amiability + 0 velocity + 0 potential and so on, until you had noted and measured all the qualities it possesses, and excluded all that it does not. For convenience, we ma y write this expression as Xf+b+d+r+a+v+p --- using the initials of the qualities which we call dimensions. Just one further explanation in pure mathematics. To interpret X1, X1+1 or X2, and so on, we assume the reference to be to spatial dimen - sions. Thus suppose X1 to be a line a foot long, X2 will be a plane a foot square, and X3 a cube measuring a foot in each dimension. But what about X4? There are no more spatial dimensions. Modern mathemat - ics has (unfortunately, I think) agreed to consider t his fourth dimen - sion as time. Well, and X5? To interpret this expression, we may begin to consider other qualities, such as electric capacity, colour, moral attributes, and so on. But this remark, although necessary, leads us rather away from our main thesis instead of toward it. P. What happens when we put a minus sign before the index (that small letter up on the right) instead of a plus? Quite simple. 23^ WEH NOTE: Add comments to distinguish indices (Abstract Algebra) from powers of numbers. {Ke ynote: I shouldn't, but as a physicist, I have to say} {that Crowley is giving an erroneous layman's opinion } {and his usage of math notation cannot be considered } {correct.

With a minus, we divide instead of multiplying. Thus, X3 - 2 = X3 Ã¶ X2 = X1, just as if you had merely subtracted the 2 from the 3 in the index. Now, at last, we come to the point of real importance to our thesis: how shall we in terpret X0? We may write it, obviously, as X1 - 1 or Xn - n. Good, divide. Then X1 Ã¶ X1 = 1. This is the same, clearly enough, whatever X may be. Q. Ah, but what we started to do was discover the meaning of Nothing. It is not correct to write it simply as 0; for that 0 implies an index 01, or 02, or 0n. And if our Nothing is to be absolute Nothing, then there is not only no figure, but no index either. So we must write it as 00. What is the value of this expression? We proceed as before; divide.  0n 1 0 = 0n - n = 0n Ã¶ 0n = -- x -- . Of course 0n Ã¶ 1 remains 0;  1 0n but 1 Ã¶ 0n = Ã¬ {Keynote: this last is an elongated infinity symbol}. That is, we have a clash of the \"infinitely gre at\" with the \"infinitely small;\" that knocks out the \"infinity\" (and Advaitism with it!) and leaves us with an indeterminate but finite number of utter variety.

They say \"Nothing obviously means Nothing; it has no qualities nor quantities.\" (The Advaitists27 said the same, and then stultified the mselves completely by calling it One!) \"But,\" con - tinue the sages of the Middle Kingdom, \"it is always possible to reduce any expression to Nothing by taking any two equal and opposite terms.\" (Thus n = ( - n) = 0.) \"We ought therefore to be able to get a ny expres - sion that we want from Nothing; we merely have to be careful that the terms shall be precisely opposite and equal.\" (0 = n + ( - n). This then they did, and began to diagrammatize the Universe as the Å {S.B. cap \"I\"} - a pair of opposites, the Y ang or active male, and the Yin or passive Female, principles. They represented the Yang by an unbroken ( ---- --- ), the Yin by a broken ( --- --- ), line. (The first manifestation in Nature of these two is ThÆi Yang, the Sun, and the ThÆi Yin, the Moon .)

To"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 78 remind you, and to amplify certain points of the above, let me quote from Magick pp. 152 - 3 footnote 2. \"All elements must at one time have been separate --- that wou ld be the case with great heat. Now when atoms get to the sun, we get that immense extreme heat, and all the elements are themselves again. Imagine that each atom of each element possesses the memory of all his adventures in combination. By the way, tha t atom (fortified with that memory) would not be the same atom; yet it is, because it has gained nothing from anywhere except this memory. Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by virtue of memory, a thing could become something more than itself; thus a re al development is possible. One can then see a reason for any ele - ment deciding to go through this series of incarnations, because so, and only so, can he go; and he suffers the lapse of memory which he has during these incarnations, because he knows he will come through un - changed. \"Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods, individual and equal though diverse, each one supreme and utterly indestructible. This is also the only explanation of how a \"Perfect Being\" could create a world in which war, evil, etc., exist. God is only an appearance, because (like \"good\") it cannot affect the substance itself, but only multiply its combinations. This is something the same as mystic monotheism; but all parts of himself, so that their interplay is fals e.

Gerard Aumont's promised essay28; it was originally called \"The Three Schools of Magick\". (Don't be cross, please, becaus e it is not in the form of a personal letter!) There is today much misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \"Magick\". Many attempts have been made to define it, but perhaps the best for our present purpose of historical - ideological exposition will be t his -- Magick is the Science of the Incommensurables. This is one of the many restricted uses of the word; one suited to the present purpose. It is particularly to be noted that Magick, so often mixed up in the popular idea of a religion, has nothing to do with it. It is, in fact,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 80 the exact opposite of religion; it is, even more than Physical Science, its irreconcilable enemy. let us define this difference clearly. Magick investigates the laws of Nature with the idea of making use of them. It only dif fers from \"profane\" science by always keeping ahead of it. As Fraser29 has shown, Magick is science in the tentative stage; but it may be, and often is, more than this. It is science which, for one reason or another, cannot be declared to the profane. R eligion, on the contrary, seeks to ignore the laws of Nature, or to escape them by appeal to a postulated power which is assumed to have laid them down. The religious man is, as such, incapable of understand - ing what the laws of Nature really are. (They are generalizations from the order of observed fact.) The History of Magick has never been seriously attempted. For one reason, only initiates pledged to secrecy know much about it; for another, every historian has been talking about some more or less c on - ventional idea of Magick, not of the thing itself. But Magick has led the world from before the beginning of history, if only for the reason that Magick has always been the mother of Science. It is, therefore, of extreme importance that some effort s hould be made to understand something of the subject; and there is, therefore, no apology necessary for essaying this brief outline of its historical aspects. There have always been, at least in nucleus, three main Schools of Philosophical practice. (We use the word \"philosophical\" in the old good broad sense, as in the phrase \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society for the Advancement of Knowledge.\") It is customary to describe these three Schools as Yellow, Black, and White. The first thing n ecessary is to warn the reader that they must"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 81 by no means be confounded with racial distinctions of colour; and they correspond still less with conventional symbols such as yellow caps, yellow robes, black magick, white witchcraft, and the like. The dange r 28* A few amendments - very few - have been necessitated by the lapse of time. 29^ WEH NOTE: Mention Fraser source, locate it in G.B. 46 is only the greater that these analogies are often as alluring as the prove on examination to be misleadin g. These Schools represent three perfectly distinct and contrary theories of the Universe, and, therefore, practices of spiritual science. The magical formula of each is as precise as a theorem of trigonometry. Each assumes as fundamental a certain law o f Nature, and the subject is complicated by the fact that each School, in a certain sense, admits the formulae of the other two. It merely regards them as in some way incom - plete, secondary, or illusory. Now, as will be seen later, the Yellow School sta nd aloof from the other two by the nature of its postulates. But the Black School and the White are always more or less in active conflict; and it is because just at this moment that conflict is approaching a climax that it is necessary to write this essay . The adepts of the White School consider the present danger to mankind so great that they are prepared to abandon their traditional policy of silence, in order to enlist in their ranks the profane of every nation. We are in possession of a certain mysti cal document30 which we may describe briefly, for convenience sake, as an Apocalypse of which we"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 82 hold the keys, thanks to the intervention of the Master who has appeared at this grave conjuncture of Fate. This document consists of a series of visions, in which we hear the various Intelligences whose nature it would be hard to define, but who are at the very least endowed with knowledge and power far beyond anything that we are accustomed to regard as proper to the human race. We must quote a passage from one of the most important of these documents. The doctrine is conveyed, as is customary among Initiates, in the form of a parable. Those who have attained even a mediocre degree of enlight - enment are aware that the crude belief of the faithful, and the c rude infidelity of the scoffer, with regard to matters of fact, are merely childish. Every incident in Nature, true or false, possesses a spiritual significance. It is this significance, and only this significance, that possesses any philosophical value to the Initiate. The orthodox need not be shocked, and the enlightened need not be contemp - tuous, to learn that the passage which we are about to quote, is a parable based on the least decorous of the Biblical legends which refer to Noah. It simply captu res for its own purposes the convenience of Scripture. (Here follows the excerpt from the Vision.) \"And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the Most High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the adepts. And B ABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she hath fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called her children together saying: Come up with me, and let us make a mock of the naked - ness of the Most High. \"And the first of the adepts covere d His shame with a cloth, walking backwards, and was white. And the second of the adepts covered his shame with a cloth, walking sideways, and was yellow, And the third of"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 83 the adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walking forwards, and was black. And thes e are the three great schools of the Magi, who are also the three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not 30* Liber CDXVIII, The Vision and the Voice, edition with Introduction and Commentary by 666. Thelema Publishing Co., Barstow, California. 47 wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if the three schools be not one.\" We are now ready to study the philosophical bases of these three Schools. We must, however, enter a caveat against too literal an interpretat ion, even of the parable. It may be suspected, for reasons which should be apparent after further investigation of the doctrines of the Three Schools, that this parable was invented by an Intelligence of the Black School, who was aware of his iniquity, an d thought to transform it into righteousness by the alchemy of making a boast of it. The intelligent reader will note the insidious attempt to identify the doctrine of the Black School with the kind of black magic {sic} that is commonly called Diabolism. In other words, this parable is itself an example of an exceedingly subtle black magical operation, and the contemplation of such devices carried far enough beings us to an understanding of the astoundingly ophidian processes of Magicians. Let not the pr ofane reader dismiss such subtleties from his mind as negligible nonsense. It is cunning of this kind that determines the price of potatoes. The above digression is perhaps not so inexcusable as it may seem on a"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 84 first reading. Careful study of it should reveal the nature of the thought - processes which are habitually used by the secret Masters of the human race to determine its destiny. When everyone has done laughing, I will ask you to compare the real effects produced on the course of human affairs by C aesar, Attila, and Napoleon, on the one hand; of Plato, the Encyclopaedists, and Karl Marx31 on the other. The Yellow School of Magick considers, with complete scientific and philosophical detachment, the fact of the Universe as a fact. Being itself apar t of that Universe, it realizes its impotence to alter the totality in the smallest degree. To put it vulgarly, it does not try to raise itself from the ground by pulling at its socks. It therefore opposes to the current of phenomena no reaction either o f hatred or of sympathy. So far as it attempts to influence the course of events at all, it does so in the only intelligent way conceivable. It seeks to diminish internal friction. It remains, therefore, in a contemplative attitude. To use the terms of Western philosophy, there is in its attitude something of the stoicism of Zeno; or of the Pickwickianism, if I may use the term, of Epicurus. The ideal reaction to phenomena is that of perfect elasticity. It possesses something of the cold - bloodedness of mathematics; and for this reason it seems fair to say, for the purposes of elementary study, that Pythagoras is its most adequate exponent in European philosophy. Since the discovery of Asiatic thought, however, we have no need to take our ideas at secon d - hand. The Yellow School of Magick possesses one perfect classic. The Tao Teh King32. 31* It is interesting to note that the three greatest influences in the world today are those of Teutonic Hebrews: Marx, Hertz, and Freud."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 85 32* Unfortunately there is no translation at present published which is the work of an Initiate. All existing translations have been garbled by people who simply failed to understand the text. An approximately per - fect rendering is indeed available, but so far it exists only in manu - script. One object of this letter is to create sufficient public interest to make this work, and others of equal value available to the public. 48 It is impossible to find any religion which adequately represents the thought of this masterp iece. Not only is religion as such repugnant to science and philosophy, but from the very nature of the tenets of the Yellow School, its adherents are not going to put themselves to any inconvenience for the enlightenment of a lot of people whom they cons ider to be hopeless fools. At the same time, the theory of religion, as such, being a tissue of falsehood, the only real strength of any religion is derived from its pilferings of Magical doctrine; and, religious persons being by defini - tion entirely uns crupulous, it follows that any given religion is likely to contain scraps of Magical doctrine, filched more or less haphazard from one school or the other as occasion serves. Let the reader, therefore, beware most seriously of trying to get a grasp of thi s subject by means of siren analogies. Taoism has as little to do with the Tao Teh King as the Catholic Church with the Gospel. The Tao Teh King inculcates conscious inaction, or rather unconscious inaction, with the object of minimizing the disorder of the world.

Hoping that you are now recovered from the devastating revelations in the matter of the Yellow School, I must ask you to brace yourself for disclosures even more formidable about the Black. Do not confuse with the Black Lodge, or the Black Brothers. The terminology is unfortunate, but i t wasn't I that did it. Now then, to work! The Black School of Magick, which must by no means be confused with the School of Black Magick or Sorcery, which latter is a perversion of the White tradition, is distinguished fundamentally from the Yellow Scho ol in that it considers the Universe not as neutral, but as definitely a"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 88 curse. Its primary theorem is the \"First Noble Truth\" of the Buddha --- \"Everything is Sorrow.\" In the primitive classics of this School the idea of sorrow is confused with that of sin. (This idea of universal lamentation is presumably responsible for the choice of black as its symbolic colour. And yet? Is not white the Chinese hue of mourning?) The analysis of the philosophers of this School refers every phenomenon to the catego ry of sorrow. It is quite useless to point out to them that certain events are accompanied with joy: they continue their ruth - less calculations, and prove to your satisfaction, or rather dissatis - faction, that the more apparently pleasant an event is, t he more malignantly deceptive is its fascination. There is only one way of escape even conceivable, and this way is quite simple, annihilation. (Shallow critics of Buddhism have wasted a great deal of stupid ingenuity on trying to make out that Nirvana or Nibbana means something different from what etymology, tradition and the evidence of the Classics combine to define it. The word means, quite simply, cessation: and it stands to reason that, if everything is sorrow, the only thing which is not sorrow is nothing, and that therefore to escape from sorrow is the attain - ment of nothingness.) Western philosophy has on occasion approached this doctrine. It has at least asserted that no known form of existence is exempt from sorrow. 50 Huxley says, in his Evolution and Ethics, \"Suffering is the badge of all the tribe of sentient things.\" "},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 89 The philosophers of this School, seeking, naturally enough, to amend the evil at the root, inquire into the cause of this existence which is sorrow, and arrive immedi ately at the 'Second Noble Truth' of the Buddha: \"The Cause of Sorrow is Desire\". They follow up with the endless conca - tenation of causes, of which the final root is Ignorance. (I am not concerned to defend the logic of this School: I merely state thei r doctrine.) The practical issue of all this is that every kind of action is both unavoidable and a crime. I must digress to explain that the confusion of thought in this doctrine is constantly recurrent. That is part of the blackness of the Ignorance w hich they confess to be the foundation of their Universe. (And after all, everyone has surely the right to have his own Universe the way he wants it.) This School being debased by nature, is not so far removed from conven - tional religion as either the W hite or the Yellow. Most primitive fetishistic religions may, in fact, be considered fairly faithful representatives of this philosophy. Where animism holds sway, the \"medicine - man\" personifies this universal evil, and seeks to propitiate it by human sac rifice. The early forms of Judaism, and that type of Christianity which we associate with the Salvation Army, Billy Sunday and the Fundamentalists of the back - blocks of America, are sufficiently simple cases of religion whose essence is the propitiation o f a malig - nant demon. When the light of intelligence begins to dawn dimly through many fogs upon these savages, we reach a second stage. Bold spirits master cour - age to assert that the evil which is so obvious, is, in some mysterious way, an illusion. They thus throw back the whole complexity of sorrow to a single cause; that is, the arising of the illusion aforesaid. The problem then assumes a final form: How is that illusion to be destroyed. "},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 90 A fairly pure example of the first stage of this type of thought is to be found in the Vedas, of the second stage, in the Upanishads. But the answer to the question, \"How is the illusion of evil to be destroyed?\", depends on another point of theory. We may postulate a Parabrahm infi - nitely good, etc. etc. etc ., in which case we consider the destruction of the illusion of evil as the reuniting of the consciousness with Parabrahm. the unfortunate part of this scheme of things is that on seeking to define Parabrahm for the purpose of returning to Its purity, it is discovered sooner or later, that It possesses no qualities at all! In other words, as the farmer said, on being shown the elephant: There ain't no sich animile. It was Gautama Buddha who perceived the inutility of dragging in this imaginary pachyderm. Since our Parabrahm, he said to the Hindu philosophers, is actually nothing, why not stick to or original perception that everything is sorrow, and admit that the only way to escape from sorrow is to arrive at nothingness? We may complete the whole tradi tion of the Indian peninsula very simply. To the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Tripitaka of the Buddhists, we have only to add the Tantras of what are called the Vamacharya Schools. Paradoxical as it may sound the Tantrics are in reality the most advanced of the Hindus. Their theory is, in its philosophical ultimatum, a primi - tive stage of the White tradition, for the essence of the Tantric cults is that by the performance of certain rites of Magick, one does not only escape disaster, but obtains positiv e benediction. The Tantric is not 51 obsessed by the will - to - die. It is a difficult business, no doubt, to"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 91 get any fun out of existence; but at least it is not impossible. In other words, he implicitly denies the fundamental proposition that exi stence is sorrow, and he formulates the essential postulate of the White School of Magick, that means exist by which the universal sorrow (apparent indeed to all ordinary observation) may be unmasked, even as at the initiatory rite of Isis in the ancient d ays of Kehm. There, a Neophyte presenting his mouth, under compulsion, to the pouting buttocks of the Goat of Mendez, found himself caressed by the chaste lips of a virginal priestess of that Goddess at the base of whose shrine is written that No man has lifted her veil. The basis of the Black philosophy is not impossibly mere climate, with its resulting etiolation of the native, its languid, bilious, anaemic, fever - prostrated, emasculation of the soul of man. We accordingly find few true equivalents of this School in Europe. In Greek philosophy there is no trace of any such doctrine. The poison in its foulest and most virulent form only entered with Christianity33. But even so, few men of any real eminence were found to take the axioms of pessimism se riously. Huxley, for all of his harping on the minor key, was an eupeptic Tory. The culmination of the Black philosophy is only found in Schopenhauer, and we may regard him as having been obsessed, on the one hand, by the despair born of that false scepti cism which he learnt from the bankruptcy of Hume and Kant; on the other, by the direct obsession of the Buddhist docu - ments to which he was one of the earliest Europeans to obtain access. He was, so to speak, driven to suicide by his own vanity, a curious parallel to Kiriloff in The Possessed of Dostoiewsky. We have, however, examples plentiful enough of religions deriving almost exclusively from the Black tradition in the different stages.

But in the same class, we must place Christian Science, so grotesquely afraid of pain, suffering and evil of every sort, that its dupes can think of nothing better than to bleat denials of its actuality, in the hope of hypnotizing themselves into anaesthesia. Practically no Westerns have reached the third stage of the Black tradi - tion, the Buddhist stage. It is only isolated mystics, and those men who rank themselves with a contemptuous compliance under the standard of the nearest religion, the one which will bother them least in their quest of nothingness, who carry the sorites so far. T he documents of the Black School of Magick have already been indicated. They are, for the most part, tedious to the last degree and repulsive to every wholesome - minded man; yet it can hardly be denied that such books as The Dhammapada and Ecclesiastes are masterpieces of literature. They represent the agony of human despair at its utmost degree of intensity, and the melancholy contemplation which is induced by their perusal is not favourable to the inception of that mood which should lead every truly coura geous intelligence to the determination to escape from the 33* Anti - semite writers in Europe --- e.g. Weininger --- call the Black theory and practice Judaism, while by a curious confusion, the same ideas are called Christian among Anglo - Saxons. In 1936 e.v. the \"Nazi\" School began to observe this fact. 34* N.B.

Let us leave the sinister figure of Schopenhauer for the mysteriously radiant shape of Spinoza! This latter philosopher, in respect at least of his Pantheism, represents fairly enough the fundamental thesis of the White tradition. Almost the first observ ation that we have to make is that this White tradition is hardly discoverable outside Europe. It appears first of all in the legend of Dionysus. (In this connection read carefully Browning's Apollo and the Fates.) The Egyptian tradition of Osiris is no t dissimilar. The central idea of the White School is that, admitted that \"everything is sorrow\" for the profane, the Initiate has the means of transforming it to \"Every - thing is joy\". There is no question of any ostrich - ignoring of fact, as in Christia n Science. There is not even any more or less sophisti - cated argument about the point of view altering the situation as in Vedantism. We have, on the contrary, and attitude which was perhaps first of all, historically speaking, defined by Zoroaster, \"na ture teaches us, and the Oracles also affirm, that even the evil germs of Matter may alike become useful and good.\" \"Stay not on the precipice with the dross of Matter; for there is a place for thine Image in a realm ever splendid.\" \"If thou extend the F iery Mind to the work of piety, thou wilt preserve the fluxible body.\"35 It appears that the Levant, from Byzantium and Athens to Damascus, Jerusalem, Alexandria and Cairo, was preoccupied with the formulation of this School in a popular religion, beginni ng in the days of Augustus Caesar. For there are elements of this central idea in the works of the Gnostics, in certain rituals of what Frazer conveniently calls the Asiatic God, as in the remnants of the Ancient Egyptian cult. The doc -"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 94 trine became abom inably corrupted in committee, so to speak and the result was Christianity, which may be regarded as a White ritual over - laid by a mountainous mass of Black doctrine, like the baby of the mother that King Solomon non - suited. We may define the doctrine o f the White School in its purity in very simple terms. Existence is pure joy. Sorrow is caused by failure to perceive this fact; but this is not a misfortune. We have invented sorrow, which does not matter so much after all, in order to have the exubera nt satis - faction of getting rid of it. Existence is thus a sacrament. Adepts of the White School regard their brethren of the Black very much as the aristocratic English Sahib (of the days when England was a nation) regarded the benighted Hindu. Nietzs che expresses the philosophy of this School to that extent with considerable accuracy and vigour. The man who denounces life merely defines himself as the man who is unequal to it. The brave man rejoices in giving and taking hard knocks, and the brave ma n is joyous. The Scandinavian idea of Valhalla may be primitive, but it is manly. A heaven of popular concert, like the Christian; of unconscious repose, like the Buddhist; or even of sensual enjoyment, like the Moslem, excites his nausea and contempt. He understands that the only joy worth while is the joy of continual victory, and victory itself would become as tame as croquet if it were not spiced by equally contin - 35* This passage appears to be a direct hint at the Formula of the IXÃ¸ O.T.O., and th e preparation of the Elixir of Life. 53 "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 95 ual defeat. The purest documents of the White School are found in the Sacred Books of Thelema. The doctrine is given in excellent perfection both in the book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent and the book of Lapis Lazuli. A single passage is adequate to explain the formula. 7. Moreover I beheld a vision of a river. There was a little boat thereon; and in it under purple sails was a golden woman, an image of Asi wrought in finest go ld. Also the river was of blood, and the boat of shining steel. Then I loved her; and, loosing my girdle, cast myself into the stream. 8. I gathered myself into the little boat, and for many days and nights did I love he r, burning beautiful incense before her. 9. Yea! I gave her of the flower of my youth. 10. But she stirred not; only by my kisses I defiled her so that she turned to blackness before me. 11. Yet I worshipped her, and gave her o f the flower of my youth. 12. Also it came to pass, that thereby she sickened, and corrupted before me. Almost I cast myself into the stream. 13.

There is thus in this School no attempt to deny that Nature is, as Zoroaster said, \"a fatal and evil force\"; but Nature is, so to speak, \"the First Matter of the Work\", which is to be transmuted into gold.

The formula is evidently one of dauntless co urage. It expresses the idea of vitality and manhood in its most dynamic sense. The only religion which corresponds to this School at all is that of ancient Egypt; possibly also that of Chaldea. This is because those religions are Magical religions in t he strict technical sense; the religious component of them is negligible. So far as it exists, it exists only for the uninitiate. There are, however, traces of the beginning of the influence of the School in Judaism and in Paganism. There are, too, cert ain documents of the pure Greek spirit which bear traces of this. It is what they called Theurgy. The Christian religion in its simplest essence, by that idea of over - coming evil through a Magical ceremony, the Crucifixion, seems at first sight a fair e xample of the White tradition; but the idea of sin and of propitiation tainted it abominably with Blackness. There have been, however, certain Christian thinkers who have taken the bold logical step of regarding evil as a device of God for exercising the joys of combat and victory. This is, of course, a perfectly White doctrine; but it is regarded as the most dangerous of heresies. (Romans VI. 1,2, et al.) For all that, the idea is there. The Mass itself is essentially a typical White ritual. Its purp ose is to transform crude matter directly into Godhead. It is thus a cardinal operation of Talismanic Magick. But the influence of the Black School has corroded the idea with theological accretions, metaphysical on the one hand, and superstitious on the other, so completely as to mask the Truth altogether.

The Protestant thinkers did their best to get rid of the idea of sin, but it was soon seen that the effort could only lead to antinomian - ism; and they recognized that this would infallibly destroy the religious idea as such. 55 Mysticism, both Catholic and Protestant, made a further attempt to free Christianity from the dark cloud of iniquity. They joined hands wit h the Sufis and the Vedantists. But this again led to the mere denial of the reality of evil. Thus drawing away, little by little, from clear appreciation of the facts of Nature, their doctrine became purely theoretical, and faded away, while the thunder cloud of sin settled down more heavily than ever. The most important of all the efforts of the White School, from an exo - teric point of view, is Islam. In its doctrine there is some slight taint, but much less than in Christianity. It is a virile relig ion. It looks facts in the face, and admits their horror; but it proposes to overcome them by sheer dint of manhood. Unfortunately, the meta - physical conceptions of its quasi - profane Schools are grossly material - istic. It is only the Pantheism of the S ufis which eliminates the conception of propitiation; and, in practice, the Sufis are too closely allied to the Vedantists to retain hold of reality.

It has been a long --- I hope not too tedio us --- voyage; but at last the harbour is in sight. Our Essay approaches its goal; the theory of Life to which initiation tends. Let us continue! There is in history only one movement whose object has been to organize the isolated adepts of the White Sc hool of Magick, and this movement was totally unconnected with religion, except in so far as it lent its influence to the reformers of the Christian church. Its appeal was not at all to the people. It merely offered to open up relations with, and communi cate certain practical secrets of wisdom to, isolated men of science through Europe. This movement is generally known by the name of Rosicrucianism. The word arouses all sorts of regrettable correspondences; but the adepts of the Society have never worri ed themselves in the least about the abuse of their name for the purposes of charlatanism, or about the attacks directed against them by envious critics. Indeed, so wisely have they concealed their activities that some modern scholars of the shallower typ e have declared that no such movement ever existed, that it was a kind of practical joke played upon the curiosity of the credu - lous Middle Ages. It is at least certain that, since the original 56 "},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 100 proclamations, no official publications have been put forward. The essential secrets have been maintained inviolate. If, during the last few years, a considerable number of documents have been published by them, though not in their name, it is on account of the impending crisis to civilization, of whic h mention will later be made. There is no good purpose, even were there license, to discuss the nature of the basis of scientific attainment which is the core of the doctrines of the Society. It is only necessary to point out that its correspondence with alchemy is the one genuine fact on the subject which has been allowed to transpire; for the Rosicrucian, as indicated by his central symbol, the barren cross on which he has made a rose to flower, occupies him - self primarily with spiritual and physiologi cal alchemy. Taking for \"The First Matter of the Work\" a neutral or inert substance (it is con - stantly described as the commonest and least valued thing on earth, and may actually connote any substance whatever) he deliberately poisons it, so to speak, b ringing it to a stage of transmutation generally called the Black Dragon, and he proceeds to work upon this virulent poison until he obtains the perfection theoretically possible. Incidentally, we have an almost precise parallel with this operation in mod ern bacteriology. The apparently harmless bacilli of a disease are cultivated until they become a thousand times more virulent than at first, and it is from this culture that is prepared the vaccine which is an efficacious remedy for all the possible rava ges of that kind of micro - organism. . . . .  . . . . We have been obliged to expose, perhaps at too considerable a length, the main doctrines of the three Schools. The task, however tedious, has been necessary in order to explain with reasonable lucidity their"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 101 connection with the world which their ideas direct; that is to say, the nature of their political activities. The Yellow School, in accordance with its doctrine of perfectly elastic reaction and non - interfer ence, holds itself, generally speaking, entirely apart from all such questions. We can hardly imagine it sufficiently interested in any events soever to react aggressively. It feels strong enough to deal satisfactorily with anything that may turn up: and generally speaking, it feels that any conceivable action on its part would be likely to increase rather than to diminish the mischief. It remains somewhat contemptuously aloof from the eternal conflict of the Black School with the White. At the same tim e, there is a certain feeling among the Yellow adepts that should either of these Schools become annihilated, the result might well be that the victor would sooner or later turn his released energy against themselves. In accordance, therefore, with their general plan of non - action, as expressed in the Tao Teh King, of dealing with mischief before it has become too strong to be dangerous, they interfere gently from time to time to redress the balance. During the last two generations the Masters of the Yell ow School have been compelled to take notice of the progressive ruin of the White adepts. Christianity, which possessed at least the semblance of a White formula, is in the agonies of decomposition, even before it is 57 actually dead. Materialist ic science has overwhelmed the faith and"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 102 hope of the Christians (they never possessed any charity to overwhelm) with a demonstration of the sorrow, transitoriness and cruel futility of the Universe. A vast wave of pessimism has engulfed the fortress of Ma nsoul. It was indeed a deadly blow to the adepts of the White School when Science, their own familiar friend in whom they trusted, lifted up his heel against them. It was in this conjuncture that the Yellow adepts sent forth into the Western world a mess enger, Helena Petrowna Blavatsky, with the distinct mission to destroy, on the one hand, the crude schools of Christianity, and, on the other, to eradicate the materialism from Physical Science. She made the necessary connection with Edward Maitland and A nna Kingsford, who were trying rather helplessly to put the exoteric formulae of the White School into th hands of students, and with the secret representatives of the Rosicru - cian Brotherhood. It is not for us in this place to estimate the degree of suc cess with which she carried out her embassy; but at least we see today that Physical Science is at last penetrating to the spiritual basis of material phenomena. The work of Henry PoincarÅ , Einstein, Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell is sufficient evidence of this fact. Christianity, too, has fallen into a lower degree of contempt than ever. Realizing that it was moribund, it made a supreme and suicidal effort, and plunged into the death - spasm of the first world - war. It was too far corrupt to react to the injections of the White formula which might have saved it. We see today that Christianity is more bigoted, further divorced from reality, than ever. In some countries it has again become a persecuting church. With horrid glee the adepts of the Black Sc hool looked on at these"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 103 atrocious paroxysms. But it did more. It marshalled its forces quietly, and prepared to clean up the debris of the battlefields. It is at present (1924 e.v.) pledged to a supreme attempt to chase the manly races from their spirit ual halidom. (The spasm still [1945 e.v.] continues; note well the pro - German screams of Anglican Bishops, and the intrigues of the Vatican.) The Black School has always worked insidiously, by treachery. We need then not be surprised by finding that its most notable representative was the renegade follower of Blavatsky, Annie Besant, and that she was charged by her Black masters with the mission of persuading the world to accept for its Teacher a negroid36 Messiah. To make the humiliation more complete, a wretched creature was chosen who, to the most loath - some moral qualities, added the most fatuous imbecility. And then blew up! . . .  . . . This, then, is the present state of the war of the Three Schools. We cannot suppose that humanity is so entirely base as to accept Krishna - murti; yet that such a scheme could ever have been conceived is a symptom of the almost hopeless decadence of the White School37. The 36^ WEH NOTE: Inject something about Krishnam urti here, and soften the racial remark made above. 37* Note. This passage was written in 1924 e.v. The Master Therion arose and smote him.

It is only one step to the stage when the annihilation of all life and thought will appear as a fatal necessity. The materialism and vital scepticism of the present time, its frenzied rush for pleasure in total disregard of any idea of building for the future, testifies to a condi - tion of complete moral disorder, of abject spiritual anarchy. The White School has thus been paralysed. We are reminded of the spider de scribed by Fabre, who injects her victims with a poison which paralyzes them without killing them, so that her own young may find fresh meat. And this is what is going to happen in Europe and America unless some - thing is done about it, and done in very sh ort order. The Yellow School could not remain impassive spectators of the abomina - tions. Madame Blavatsky was a mere forerunner. They, in conjunction with the Secret Chiefs of the White School in Europe, Chiefs who had been compelled to suspend all att empts at exoteric enlightenment by the general moral debility which had overtaken the races from which they drew their adepts, have prepared a guide for mankind. This man, of an extreme moral force and elevation, combined with a profound sense of worldly realities, has stood forth in an attempt to save the White School, to rehabilitate its formula, and to fling back from the bastions of moral freedom the howling savages of pessimism. Unless his appeal is heard, unless there comes a truly virile reaction a gainst the creeping atrophy which is poisoning them, unless they enlist to the last man under his standard, a great decisive battle will have been lost. This prophet of the White School, chosen by its Masters and his brethren, to save the Theory and Pract ice, is armed with a sword far mightier than Excalibur. He has been entrusted with a new Magical formula, one which can be accepted by the whole human race. Its adoption will strengthen"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 105 the Yellow School by giving a more positive value to their Theory; w hile leaving the postulates of the Black School intact, it will transcend them and raise their Theory and Practice almost to the level of the Yellow. As to the White School, it will remove from them all taint of poison of the Black, and restore vigour to t heir central formula of spiritual al - chemy by giving each man an independent ideal. It will put an end to the moral castration involved in the assumption that each man, whatever his nature, should deny himself to follow out a fantastic and impracti - cabl e ideal of goodness. Incidentally, this formula will save Physical Science itself by making negligible the despair of futility, the vital scepticism which has emasculated it in the past. It shows that the joy of existence is not in a goal, for that indee d is clearly unattainable, but in the going itself. This law is called the Law of Thelema. It is summarized in the four words, \"Do what thou wilt.\" It should not be necessary to explain that a full appreciation of this message is not to be obtained by a hasty examination. It is essential to study it from every point of view, to analyse it with the keenest philosophical acumen, and finally to apply it as a key for every problem, internal and external, that exists. This key, applied with skill, will open every lock. From the deepest point of view, the greatest value of this formula is that it affords, for the first time in history, a basis of reconciliation 59 between the three great Schools of Magick. It will tend to appease the"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 106 eternal conflic t by understanding that each type of thought shall go on its own way, develop its own proper qualities without seeking to inter - fere with other formulae, however (superficially) opposed to its own. What is true for every School is equally true for every individual. Success in life, on the basis of the Law of Thelema, implies severe self - discipline. Each being must progress, as biology teaches, by strict adaptation to the conditions of the organism. If, as the Black School continually asserts, the cause of sorrow is desire, we can still escape the conclusion by the Law of Thelema. What is necessary is not to seek after some fantastic ideal, utterly unsuited to our real needs, but to discover the true nature of those needs, to fulfill them, and rejoice th erein. This process is what is really meant by initiation; that is to say, the going into oneself, and making one's peace, so to speak, with all the forces that one finds there. It is forbidden here to discuss the nature of The Book of the Law, the Sacre d Scripture of Thelema. Even after forty years of close expert examination, it remains to a great extent mysterious; but the little we know of it is enough to show that it is a sublime synthesis of all Science and all ethics. It is by virtue of this Book that man may attain a degree of freedom hitherto never suspected to be possible, a spiritual development altogether beyond anything hitherto known; and, what is really more to the point, a control of external nature which will make the boasted achievement s of the last century appear no more than childish preliminaries to an incomparably mighty manhood. It has been said by some that the Law of Thelema appeals only to the âlite of humanity. No doubt here is this much in that assertion, that"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 107 only the highes t can take full advantage of the extraordinary opportuni - ties which it offers. At the same time, \"the Law is for all.\" Each in his degree, every man may learn to realise the nature of his own being, and to develop it in freedom. It is by this means tha t the White School of Magick can justify its past, redeem its present, and assure its future, by guaranteeing to every human being a life of Liberty and of Love. Such, then, are the words of Gârard Aumont. I should not like to endorse every phrase; but t he whole exposition is so masterly in its terse, tense vigour, and so unrivalled by any other document at my disposal, that I thought it best to let you have it in its own original form, with only those few alterations which lapse of time has made necessar y.  Love is the law, love under will.  Fraternally,  666 P.S. Our own School unites the ruby red of Blood with the gold of the Sun. It combines the best characteristics of the Yellow and the White Schools. In the light of M. Aumont's exposition, it is easy to under - stand. To us, every phenomenon is an Act of Love, Every experience is necessary, 60 is a Sacrament, is a means of Growth. Hence, \" ...existence is pure joy;...\" (AL II, 9) \"A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture!

CHAPTER IX  THE SECRET CHIEFS Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Very glad I am, since at one time I was obliged to be starkly stern about impertinent curiosity, to note that your wish to be informed about the Secret Chiefs of the A.'.A.'. is justified; it is most certainly of the first importance that you and I should be quite clear in our minds about Those under whose jurisdiction and tutelage we both work. The question is beset with thickets of tough thorn; what is worse, the path is so slippery that nothing is easier than to tumble head first into the spikiest bush of them all. You justly remind me that one of my earliest slogans was \"Mystery is the enemy of Truth;\" how then is it what I acquiesce in the policy of con - cealment in a mat ter so cardinal? Perhaps the best plan is for me to set down the facts of the case, so far as is possible, from them it may appear that no alternative policy is feasible. The first condition of membership of the A.'.A.'. is that one is sworn to identify one's own Great Work with that of raising mankind to higher levels, spiritually, and in every other way. Accordingly, it stands to reason that those charged with the conduct of the Order should be at least Masters of the Temple, or their judgment would be worthless, and at least Magi (though not that particular kind of Magus who brings the Word of a New Formula to the world every 2,000 years of so) or they would be unable to influence events on any scale commensurate with the scope of the Work."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 109 Of what na ture is this Power, this Authority, this Understanding, this Wisdom --- Will? (I go up from Geburah to Chokmah.) Of the passive side it is comparatively easy to form some idea; for the qualities essential are mainly extensions of those that all of us pos sess in some degree. And whether Understanding - Wisdom is \"right\" or \"wrong\" must be largely a matter of opinion; often Time only can decide such points. But for the active side it is necessary to postulate the existence of a form of Energy at their dis posal which is able \"to cause change to occur in conformity with the Will\" --- one definition of \"Magick\". 61 Now this, as you know, is an exceedingly complex subject; its theory is tortuous, and its practice encompassed with every kind of difficu lty. Is there no simple method? Yes: the thaumaturgic engine disposes of a type of energy more adaptable than Electricity itself, and both stronger and subtler than this, its analogy in the world of profane science. One might say, that it is elec - tric al, or at least one of the elements in the \"Ring - formula\" of modern Mathematical Physics. In the R.R. et A.C., this is indicated to the Adept Minor by the title conferred upon him on his initiation to that grade: Hodos Camelionis: --- the Path of the Cha meleon.

It is of this universally powerful weapon that the Secret Chiefs must be supposed to possess complete control. The y can induce a girl to embroider a tapestry, or initiate a political movement to culminate in a world - war; all in pursuit of some plan wholly beyond the purview or the comprehension of the deepest and subtlest thinkers. (It should go without saying that t he adroit use of these vibrations enables one to perform all the classical \"miracles.\") These powers are stupendous: they seem almost beyond imagination to conceive. \"Hic ego nec metas rerum nec tempora pono; Imperium sine fine ded i.\" as Vergil, that mighty seer and magician of Rome at her perihelion says in his First Book of the Aenead. (Vergil whose every line is also an Oracle, the leaves of his book more sacred, more significant, more sure than those of the Cumaean Sibyl!) Th ese powers move in dimensions of time and space quite other than those with which we are familiar. Their values are incomprehensible to us. To a Secret Chief, wielding this weapon, \"The nice conduct of a clouded cane\" might be infinitely more important th an a war, famine and pesti - lence such as might exterminate a third part of the race, to promote whose welfare is the crux of His oath, and the sole reason of His existence!

Well, the \"invisible\" and \"inaccessible\" criticism may equally be 62 leveled at Captain A. and Admiral B. of the Naval Intelligence De partment.

Again, They may send an ordinary living man, whether one of Themselves or no I cannot feel sure, to instruct me in some task, or to set me right when I have erred. Then there have been messages convey ed by natural objects, animate or inanimate39. Needless to say, the outstand - ing example in my life is the whole Plan of Campaign concerning The Book of the Law. But is Aiwaz a man (presumably a Persian or Assyrian) and a \"Secret Chief,\" or is He an \"an gel\" in the sense that Gabriel is an angel? Is Ab - ul - Diz an Adept who can project himself into the aura of some woman with whom I happen to be living, although she has no pre - vious experience of the kind, or any interest in such matters at all?

More largely, one cannot judge how a plan is progre ssing when one has no precise idea what it is. A soldier is told to \"attack;\" he may be intended to win through, to cover a general retreat, or to gain time by deliberate sacrifice. Only the Commander in Chief knows what the order means, or why he issues it; and even he does not know the issue, or whether it will display and justify his military skill and judgment. Our business is solely to obey orders: our responsibility ends when we have satisfied ourselves that they emanate from a source which has the right to command. P.P.S. A visitor's story has just reminded me of the possibility that I am a Secret Chief myself without knowing it: for I have sometimes been recognized by other people as having acted as such, though I was not aware of the fact at th e time.

All the su bsidiary work --- awareness, one - pointedness, mind - fullness and the rest --- is intended to train you to this. All the greetings, salutations, \"Saying Will,\" periodical adorations, even saying \"apo pantos kakodaimonos\" with a downward and outward sweep o f the arm, the eyes averted, when one sees a person dressed in a religious (Christian) uniform: all these come under \"Don't stroke the cat the wrong way!\" or, in the modern pseudo - scientific journalese jargon \"streamlining life.\" Let us see if Frater Perd urabo has anything to the point! Of course, Part I of Book 4 is devoted to it; but there is too much, and not enough, to be useful to us just now. What your really need is the official Instruction in The Equinox, and the very fullest and deepest understa nding of Eight Lectures on Yoga; but these lectures are so infernally interesting that when I look into the book for something to quote, it carries me away with it.

I must keep always in mind that you are assumed to know nothing whatever about Yoga and Ma gick, or anything else beyond what the average educated person may be assumed to have been taught. What is the problem? There are two. Beta: To train the mind to move with the maximum speed and energy, with the utmost possible accuracy i n the chosen direction, and with the minimum of disturbance or friction. That is Magick. 1 Alpha: To stop the mind altogether. That is Yoga. The rules, strangely enough, are identical in both cases; at least, until your \"Magick\" is perfect; Yoga merely goes on a step further. In Beta you have reduced all movements from many to One; in Alpha you reduce that One to Zero. Now then, with a sigh of relief, know you this: that every possible inci - dent in the Beta training is mutatis mutandis, perfectly familiar to the engineer. The material must be chosen and prepared in the kind and in the manner, best suited to the design of the intended machine; the various parts must be put together with the utmost precision; every obstacle to t he function must be removed, and every source of error eliminated.

So you have no reason to be discouraged if success does not smile upo n you in the first week or so of your Work, starting as you do with material of whose properties you are miserably ignorant, with means pitifully limited, with Laws of Nature which you do not understand; in fact, with almost everything against you but indo mitable Will and unconquerable courage. (I know I'm a poor contemptible Lowbrow; but I refuse to be ashamed for finding Kipling's If and Henley's Don't remember - the title; they may not be poetry --- but they are honest food and damned good beer for the pl ebeian wayfarer. It was such manhood, not the left - wing high - brow Bloomsbury sissies, that kept London through the blitz. Pray forgive the digression!) There is only one method to adopt in such circumstances as those of the Aspirant to Magick and Yoga: the method of Science. Trial and error. You must observe. That implies, first of all, that you must learn to ob - serve. And you must record your observations. No circumstance of life is, or can be irrelevant. \"He that is not with me is against me.\" I n all these letters you will find only two things: either I tell you what is bad for you, or what is good for you. But I am not you; I don't know every detail of your life, every trick of your thought. You must do ninety percent of the work for yourself. Whether it is love, or your daily avo - cation, or diet, or friends, or amusement, or anything else, you must find out what helps you to your True Will and what hinders; cherish the one and eschew the other. I want to insist most earnestly that concentra tion is not, as we nearly"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 122 all of us think, a matter of getting things right in the practices; you must make every breath you draw subservient to the True Will, to fertilize the soil for the practices. When you sit down in your Asana to quiet your mind, it is much easier for you if your whole life has tended to relative quietude; when you knock with your Wand to announce the opening of an Invocation, it is better if the purpose of that ceremony has been simmer - ing in the background of your thought since ch ildhood! Yes indeed: background! Deep down, on the very brink of the subconscious, are all those facts which have determined you to choose this your Great Work. 2 Then, the ambition, conscious, which arranges the general order and dispo - sition of your life. Lastly, the practices themselves. And my belief is that the immense majority of failures have their neglect to brush up their drill to thank for it. For technical advice on all these subjects, I shall refer you to those official works ment ioned in the early part of this letter; I shall be happy if you will take to heart what I am now so violently thrusting at you, this Middle Work of Concentration.

HOW TO DO IT:  HOW TO VERIFY YOUR EXPERIENCES"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 123 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. The re is no better way of training the memory than the practice of the Holy Qabalah. The whole mechanism of memory depends on joining up independent data. You must go on adding a little to little, always joining the simple impres - sions by referring them to others which are more general; and so on until the whole of your universe is arranged like the brain and the nervous system. This system in fact, becomes the Universe. When you have got everything properly correlated, your central consciousness understan ds and controls every tiniest detail. But you must begin at the beginning --- you go out for a walk, and the first thing you see is a car; that represents the Atu VII, the Chariot, referred to Cancer. Then you come to a fishmonger, and notice certain crus tacea, very mala chostomous. This comes under the same sign of Cancer. The next thing you notice is an amber - coloured dress in Swan and Edgar's; amber also is the colour of Cancer in the King's Scale. Now then you have a set of three impressions which i s joined together by the fact that they all belong to the Cancer class; experience will soon teach that you can remember all three very much more clearly and accurately than you could any one of the three singly. You have not increased the burden on your memory, but diminished it. What you say about tension and eagerness and haste is very true. See The Book of the Law, Chapter I, 44. \"For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.\" This, from a practical point of view, is one of the most important verses "},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 124 3 in the book. The unusual word \"unassuaged\" is very interesting. People generally suppose that \"will\" is the slave of purpose, that you cannot will a thing properly unless you are aim ing at a definite goal. But this is not the case. Thinking of the goal actually serves to distract the mind. In these few words is included the whole method without all the bombastic piety of the servile doctrine of mysticism about the surrender of the Will. Nor is this idea of surrender actually correct; the will must be identified with the Divine Will, so - called. One wants to become like a mighty flowing river, which is not consciously aiming at the sea, and is certainly not yielding to any external influence. It is acting in conformity with the law of its own nature, with the Tao. One can describe it, if necessary, as \"passive love\"; but it is love (in effect) raised to its highest potential. We come back to the same thing: when passion is purged of any \"lust of result\" it is irresistible; it has become \"Law.\" I can never understand why it is that mystics fail to see that their smarmy doctrine of surrender actually insists upon the duality which they have set out to abolish! I certainly have no in tention of \"holding you down\" to \"a narrow path of work\" or any path. All I can do is to help you to understand clearly the laws of your own nature, so that you may go ahead without extraneous influence. It does not follow that a plan that I have found s uccessful in my own case will be any use to you. That is another cardinal mistake of most teachers.

Most teachers, consciously or unconsciously, try to get others to follow in their steps. I might as well dress you up in my cast - off clothing! (In the steps of the Master. At the feet of the Master. Steward!) Please observe that the further you get on, the higher your potential, the greater is the tendency to leak, or even to break the containing vessel. I can help you by warning you against setting up obstacles, real or imaginary, in your own path; which is what most people do. It is almost laughable to think that the Great Work consists merely in \"letting her rip;\" but Karma bum ps you from one side of the toboggan slide to the other, until you \"come into the straight.\" (There's a chapter or two in the Book of Lies about this, but I haven't got a copy. I must find one, and put them in here. Yes: p. 22) O thou that settest out upon the Path, false is the Phantom that thou seekest. When thou hast it thou shalt know all bitterness, thy teeth fixed in the Sodom - Apple. Thus hast thou been lured along that Path, whose terror else had driven thee far away. O thou that stridest upon the middle of the Path, no phantoms mock thee. For the stride's sake thou stridest. Thus art thou lured along that Path, whose fascination else had driven thee far away. O thou that drawest toward the E nd of The Path, effort is no more. Faster and faster dost thou fall; thy weariness is changed into Ineffable Rest. 4"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 126 For there is no Thou upon that Path: thou hast become The Way. As in the Yi King, the 3rd hexagram has departed fr om the original perfec - tion, and it takes all the rest of the hexagrams to put things right again. The result, it is true, is superior; the perfection of the original has been enhanced and enriched by its experience. There is another way of defining the Great Work. That explains to us the whole object of manifestation, of departing from the perfection of \"Nothing\" towards the perfection of \"everything\", and one may consider this advan - tage, that it is quite impossible to go wrong. Every experience, wha tever may be its nature, is just another necessary bump. Naturally one cannot realize this until one becomes a Master of the Temple; consequently one is perpetually plunged in sorrow and despair. There is, you see, a good deal more to it than merely lear ning one's mistakes. One can never be sure what is right and what is wrong, until one appreciates that \"wrong\" is equally \"right.\" Now then one gets rid of the idea of \"effort\" which is associated with \"lust of result.\" All that one does is to exercise pleasantly and healthfully one's energies. It will not do to regard \"man\" as the \"final cause\" of manifestation. Please do not quote myself against me.  \"Man is so infinitely small,  In all these stars, determinat e.  Maker and master of them all,  Man is so infinitely great.\" The human apparatus is the best instrument of which we are, at present, aware in our normal consciousness; but when you come to experience the Conver sation of the higher intelligences, you will understand how imper - fect are your faculties.

The important thing is to make contact with beings, whatever their nature, who are superior to yourself, not merely in degree but it kind. That is to say, not merely different as a Great Dane dif fers from a Chihuahua, but as a buffalo differs from either. Of course you are perfectly right about the senses, though I would not agree to confine the meaning to the five which are common to most people. There must, one might suspect, be ways of apprehe nding directly such phenomena as magnetism, electrical resistance, chemical affinity and the like. Let me direct you once more to The Book of the Law, Chapter II, vs. 70 - 72. \"There is help & hope in other spells. Wisdom says: be strong! T hen canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein! \"But exce ed! exceed! \"Strive ever to more! and if thou art truly mine --- and doubt it not, an if thou art ever joyous! --- death is the crown of all.\" 5 The mystic's idea of deliberately stupefying and stultifying himself is an \"abominatio n unto the Lord.\" This, by the way, does not conflict with the rules of Yoga. That kind of suppression is comparable to the restric - tions in athletic training, or diet in sickness. "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 128 Now we get back to the Qabalah --- how to make use of it. Let us suppo se that you have been making an invocation, or shall we call it an investigation, and suppose you want to interpret a passage of Bach. To play this is the principal weapon of your ceremony. In the course of your operation, you assume your astral body and rise far above the terres - trial atmosphere, while the music continues softly in the background. You open your eyes, and find that it is night. Dark clouds are on the horizon; but in the zenith is a crown of constellations. This light helps you, especial ly as your eyes become accustomed to the gloom, to take in your surroundings. It is a bleak and barren landscape. Terrific mountains rim the world. In the midst looms a cluster of blue - black crags. Now there appears from their recesses a gigantic being. His strength, especially in his hands and in his loins, it terrifying. he suggests a combination of lion, mountain goat and serpent; and you instantly jump to the idea that this is one of the rare beings which the Greeks called Chimaera. So formidable is his appearance that you consider it prudent to assume an appropriate god - form. But who is the appropriate god? You may perhaps consider it best, in view of your complete ignorance as to who he is and where you are, to assume the god - form of Harpocrate s, as being good defence in any case; but of course this will not take you very far. If you are sufficiently curious and bold, you will make up your mind rapidly on this point. This is where your daily practice of the Qabalah will come in useful. You ru n through in your mind the seven sacred planets. The very first of them seems quite consonant with what you have so far seen. Everything suits Saturn well enough. To be on the safe side, you go through the others; but this is a very obvious case --- Satu rn is the only planet that agrees with everything. The only other possibility will be the Moon; but there is no trace noticeable of any of her more amiable"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 129 characteristics. You will therefore make up your mind that it is a Saturnian god - form that you nee d. Fortunate indeed for you that you have practiced daily the assumption of such forms! Very firmly, very steadily, very slowly, very quietly, you transform your normal astral appearance into that of Sebek. The Chimaera, recognizing your divine authorit y, becomes less formidable and menacing in appearance. He may, in some way, indicate his willingness to serve you. Very good, so far; but it is of course the first essential to make sure of his integrity. Accordingly you begin by asking his name. This is vital; because if he tells you the truth, it gives you power over him. But if, on the other hand, he tells you a lie, he abandons for good and all his fortress. He becomes rather like a submarine whose base has been destroyed. He may do you a lot of mischief in the meantime, of course, so look out! Well then, he tells you that his name is Ottillia. Shall we try to spell it in Greek or in Hebrew. By the sound of the name and perhaps to some extent by his appearance one might plump for the former; bu t after all the Greek Qabalah is so unsatisfactory. We give Hebrew the first chance --- we start with Ayin Teth Yod Lamed Yod Aleph Hay {render in Hebrew}. Let us try this lettering for a start. It adds up to 135. I daresay that you don't remember what the Sepher Sephiroth tells you about the number; but as luck will have it, there is no need to inquire; for 135 = 3 x 45. Three is the number, is the first number of Saturn, and 45 the last. (The sum of the numbers in the magic {sic} square 6 of Saturn is 45.) That corresponds beautifully with everything you have"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 130 got so far; but then of course you must know if he is \"one of the beliv - ing Jinn.\" Briefly, is he a friend or an enemy? You accordingly say to him \"The word of the Law is Thelema {sp ell it in Greek}\" It turns out that he doesn't under - stand Greek at all, so you were certainly right in choosing Hebrew. You put it to him, \"What is the word of the Law?\" and he replies darkly. \"The word of the Law is Thora.\" That means nothing to you; any one might know as much as that, Thora being the ordinary word for the Sacred Law of Israel, and you accordingly ask him to spell it to make sure you have heard aright; and he gives you the letters, perhaps by speaking them, perhaps by showing them: Te th, Resh, Ayin. You add these up and get 279. This again is divisible by the Saturnian 3, and the result is 93; in other words, he has been precisely right. On the plane of Saturn one may multiply by three and therefore he has given you the correct word \"Thelema\" in a form unfamiliar to you. You man now consider yourself satisfied of his good faith, and may proceed to inspect him more closely. The stars above his head suggest the influence of Binah, whose number also is three, while the most striking th ing about him is the core of his being: the letter Yod. (One does not count the termination \"AH\": being a divine suffix it represents the inmost light and the outermost light.) This Yod, this spark of intense brilliance, is of the pale greenish gold whic h one sees (in this world) in the fine gold leaf of Tibet. It glows with ever greater intensity as you concentrate upon observing him, which you could not do while you were preoccupied with investigating his credentials. Confidence being thus established , you inquire why he as appeared to you at this time and at this place; and the answer to this question is of course your original idea, that is to say, he is presenting to you in other terms that \"mountainous Fugue\" which invoked him. You listen to"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 131 him w ith attention, make such enquiries as seem good to you, and record the proceedings.

From time to time I have exhorted you with mine accustomed matchless eloquence never to neglect the prescribed Greetings: but I think it just as well to collect the various considera tions connected with their use --- and in \"Greetings\" I include \"saying Will\" before set meals, the four daily adorations of the Sun (Liber CC, vel Resh) and the salutation of Our Lady the Moon. I propose to deal with the general object of the combined ri tuals, not with the special virtues of each separately. 7 The practice of Liber III vel Jugorum1 is the complement of these grouped customs. By sharp physical self - chastisement when you think, say, or do whatever it is that you have set yourself to avoid doing, you set a sentry at the gate of your mind ready to challenge all comers, and so you acquire the habit of being on the alert.

When you are practic ing Dharana2 concentration, you allow yourself so many minutes. It is a steady, sustained effort. The mind constantly struggles to escape control. (I hope you remember the sequence of \"breaks.\" In case you don't, I summarize them. (1) Immediate ph ysical interruptions: Asana should stop these. (2) Things that are \"on you mind.\" (3) Reverie, and \"Wouldn't it help if I were to --- ?\" (4) Atmospherics --- e.g. voices apparently from some alien source. (5) Aberrations of the cont rol itself; and the result itself. (Remember the practice of some Hindu schools: \"Not that, not that!\" to whatever it is the presents itself as Tat Sat --- reality, truth). Need I remind you how urgent the wish to escape will as suredly become, how fantastic are the mind's devices and excuses, amounting often to deliberate revolt? In Kandy I broke away in a fury, and dashed down to Colombo with the intention of painting the very air as red as the betel - spittle on the pavements! But after three days of futile search for satisfying debauchery I came back to my horses, and, sure enough, it was merely that I had gone stale; the relaxation soothed and steadied me; I resumed the discipline with redoubled energy, and Dhyana dawned befo re a week had elapsed. I mention this because it is the normal habit of the mind to organize these counter - attacks that makes their task so easy. What you need is a mind that will help rather than hinder your Work by its normal function. This is where t hese Greetings, and Will - sayings, and Adorations come in. "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 133 It is not a concentration - practice proper; I haven't a good word for it. \"Background - concentration\" or \"long - distance - concentration\" are clumsy, and not too accurate. It is really rather like a pu blic school education. One is not constantly \"doing a better thing that one has ever done;\" one is not dropping one's eye - glass every two minutes, or being a little gentleman in the act of brushing one's hair. The point is that one trains oneself to react properly at any moment of surprise. It must become \"second nature\" for \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" to spring to the forefront of the mind when one is introduced to a stranger, or comes down to breakfast, or hears the telephone bell , or observes the hour of the adoration, (these are to be the superficial reactions, like instinctively rising when a lady enters the room), or, at the other end, in moments of immediate peril, or of sudden apprehension, or when in one's meditation, one ap proaches the deepest strata. 1* See Magick in Theory and Practice, pp. 427 - 429. 2** Book 4, Part I. 8 One need not be dogmatic about the use of these special words. One might choose a formula to represent one's own particular True Will.

As I said above, Adam Qadman is not my middle name. Well now, have I any shadow of an excuse? Yes, I have, after a fashion; I don't think it good manners to force my idiosyncrasies down people's throats, and I don't want to appear more of an eccentric than I need.

It seems that last Wednesday I so far forgot myself as to refer to the \"Act of Truth\" in conversation, and never mentioned what it is when it's at home, or why anyone should perform it, or what happens when one does perform it! All right, I will remedy that; luckily, it is a very simple matt er; very important, perfectly paradoxical and devastatingly effective. Analysed, it is to make the assumption that something which seems very wrong is actually all right, that an eager wish is an accomplished fact. a reasonable anxiety, entirely unfounded --- and to act accordingly. For instance, I'm in some desolate place, dependent for my food supply on a weekly messenger. If he is a day late, it is awkward; if two, it means hardship; if three, serious risk. One is naturally anxious as the"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 136 day approac hes; perhaps the weather, or some similar snag, makes it likely that he will be late. From one cause or another, I have rather exceeded my ration. There is nothing I can do about it, materially. The sensible course of action is to draw in my horns, live on the mini - mun, necessary to life, which involves cutting the day's work down to almost noting, and hope for the best, expecting the worst. But there is a Magical mode of procedure. You say to yourself: I am here to do this Work in accordance with my true Will. The Gods have got to see to it that I'm not baulked by any blinking messenger. (But take care They don't overhear you; They might mistake it for Hybris, or pre - sumption. Do it all in the Sign of Silence, under the aegis of Harpocrates, the \" Lord of Defence and Protection\"; be careful to assume his God - form, as standing on two crocodiles. Then you increase your consumption, and at the same time put in a whole lot of extra Work. If you perform this \"Act of Truth\" properly, with genuine convic tion that nothing can go wrong, your messenger will arrive a day early, and bring an extra large supply. This, let me say at once, is very difficult, especially at first, until one has gained confidence in the efficacy of the Formula; and it is very nasti ly easy to \"fake.\" Going through the motions (as they say) is more futile here than in most cases, and the results of messing it up are commonly disastrous.3 You must invent your act to suit your case, every time; suppose you expect a cable next Friday w eek, transferring cash to your account. You need $500 to make up an important payment, and you don't know whether they will send even $200. What are you going to do about it? Skimp, and save your expenses, and make yourself miserable and incapable of 3* Do not be misled by any apparent superficial resemblance to \"Christian"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 13 7 Science\" and \"Coueism\" and their cackling kin. They miss every essential feature of the formula. 10 vigorous thought or action? You may succeed in saving enough to swing the deal; but you won't get a penny beyond the amount actually needed --- and look at the cost in moral grandeur! No, go and stand yourself a champagne luncheon, and stroll up Bond Street with an 8 1/2 \"Hoyo de Monterey,\" and squander $30 on some utterly use less bauble. Then the $500 will swell to $1000, and arrive two days early at that! There are one or two points to consider very carefully indeed before you start: --- 1. The proposed Act must be absurd; it won't do at all if by some fluke, however unlikely, it might accomplish your aim. For instance, it's no use backing an outsider. there must be no causal link. 2. The Act must be one which makes the situation definitely worse. E.g.: suppose you are counting o n a new dress to make a hit at a Reception, and doubt whether it is so much better than your present best, or whether it will be finished in time. Then, wear that present best to - night (wet, of course), knowing you are sure to soil it. 3. Obviously, all the usual conditions of a Magical Operation apply in this as in all cases; your aim must conform with your True Will, and all that; but there is one curious point about an"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 138 Act of Truth: this, tha t one should resort to it only when there is no other method possible. In the explorer's case, above, it won't do if he has any means of hurrying up the messenger. It seems to me that the above brief sketch should suffice an intelligent a nd imaginative student like yourself; but if any point remains darkling, let me know, and I will follow up with a postscript. Love is the law, love under will.  Yours fraternally,   666 P.S. --- I thought it might help you if I were to make a few experiments. I have done so. Result: this is much more difficult and delicate an affair than I had thought when I wrote this letter.

Really you comfort me when you turn from those abstruse and exalted themes with which you have belaboured me so often of late to dear cuddlesome 11 little questions like this in our let ter received this morning: \"Do please, dear Master, give me some hints about how to make Talismans (that's"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 139 the same as Telesmata, isn't it? Yes, 666) and the Pantacle. The official instructions are quite clear, of course; but somehow I find them just a l ittle frightening.\" Well, I think I know pretty well what you mean; so I will try to imitate the style of Aunt Tabitha in \"The Flapper's Fireside.\" For one thing, you forgot to mention the Lamen. Now what are these things when they are at home? That's easy enough. The Lamen is a sort of Coat of Arms. It expresses the character and powers of the wearer. A talisman is a storehouse of some particular kind of energy, the kind that is needed to accomplish the task for which you have constructed it. The P antacle is often confused with both the others; accurately, it is a \"Minutum Mundum\", \"the Universe in Little\"; it is a map of all that exists, arranged in the Order of Nature. There is a chapter in Book 4, Part II, devoted to it (pp. 117 - 129); I cannot make up my mind whether I like it. At the best it is very far from being practical instruction. (The chapter on the Lamen, pp. 159 - 161, is even worse.) An analogy, not too silly, for these three; the Chess - player, the Open - ings, and the Game itself. But --- you will object --- why be silly at all? Why not say simply that the Lamen, stating as it does the Character and Powers of he wearer, is a dynamic portrait of the individual, while the Pantacle, his Universe, is a static portrait of him? And tha t, you pursue flattering, is why you preferred to call the Weapon of Earth (in the Tarot) the Disk, emphasizing its continual whirling movement rather than the Pantacle of Coin, as is more usual. Once again, exquisite child of our Father the Archer of Lig ht and of seaborn Aphrodite, your well - known acumen has \"nicked the ninety and nine and one over\" as Browning says when he (he too!) alludes to the Tarot."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 140 As you will have gathered from the above, a Talisman is a much more restricted idea; it is no more t han one of the objects in his Pantacle, one of the arrows in the quiver of his Lamen. As, then, you would expect, it is very little trouble to design. All that you need is to \"make consi - derations' about your proposed operation, decide which planet, sig n, element or sub - element or what not you need to accomplish your miracle. As you know, a very great many desirable objects can be attained by the use of the talismans in the Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon the King; also in Pietro di Abano and the dub ious Fourth Book of Cornelius Agrippa. You must on no account attempt to use the squares given in the Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage until you have succeeded in the Opera - tion. More, unless you mean to perform it, and are prepared to go to any length to do so, you are a fool to have the book in your possession at all. Those squares are liable to get loose and do things on their own initiative; and you won't like it. The late Philip Haseltine, a young composer of genius, used one of thes e squares to get his wife to return to him. He engraved it neatly on his 12 arm. I don't know how he proceeded to set to work; but his wife came back all right, and a very short time afterwards he killed himself. Then there are the Elemental Tab lets of Sir Edward Kelly and Dr. John Dee. From these you can extract a square to perform almost any conceivable operation, if you understand the virtue of the various symbols which they"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 141 manifest. They are actually an expansion of the Tarot. (Obviously, the Tarot itself as a whole is a universal Pantacle --- forgive the pleonasm! Each card, especially is this true of the Trumps, is a talisman; and the whole may also be considered as the Lamen of Mercury. It is evidently an Idea far too vast for any human mind to comprehend in its entirety. For it is \"the Wisdom whereby He created the worlds.\") The decisive advantage of this system is not that its variety makes it so adaptable to our needs, but that we already posses the Invocations necessary to call for th the Energies required. What is perhaps still more to the point, they work without putting the Magician to such severe toil and exertion as is needed when he has to write them out from his own ingenium. Yes! This is weakness on my part, and I am very naughty to encourage you to shirk the hardest path. I used often to make the background of my Talismans of four concentric circles, painting then, the first (inmost) in the King (or Knight) scale, the second in the Queen, the third in the Prince, and the outermost in the Princess scale, of the Sign, Planet, or Element to which I was devoting it. On this, preferably in the \"flashing\" colours, I would paint the appropriate Names and Figures. Lastly, the Talisman may be surrounded with a band inscribed with a suit - able \"versicle\" chosen from some Holy book, or devised by the Magician to suit the case. In the British Museum (and I suppose elsewhere) you may see the medal struck to commemorate the victory over the Armada. This is a reproduction, perhaps mo dified, of the Talisman used by Dee to raise the storm which scattered the enemy fleet. You must lay most closely to your heart the theory of the Magical Link (see Magick pp . 107 - 122) and see well to it that it rings true; for"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 142 without this your talisma n is worse than useless. It is dangerous; for all that Energy is bound to expend itself somehow; it will make its own links with anything handy that takes its fancy; and you can get into any sort of the most serious kind of trouble. There is a great deal of useful stuff in Magick; pp. 92 - 100, and pp. 179 - 189. I could go on all night doing nothing but indicating sources of information. Then comes the question of how to \"charge\" the Talisman, of how to evoke or to invoke the Beings concerned, and of - -- oh! of so much that you need a lifetime merely to master the theory. Remember, too, please, what I have pointed out elsewhere, that the greatest Masters have quite often not been Magicians at all, technically; they have used such devices as Secret Soci eties, Slogans and Books. If you are so frivolous as to try to exclude these from our discourse, it is merely evidence that you have not understood a single word of what I have been trying to tell you these last few hundred years! 13 May I close with a stray example or so? Equinox III, 1, has the Neophyte's Pantacle of Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. The Fontispiece of the original (4 vol - ume) edition of Magick, the colors vilely reproduced, is a Lamen of my own Magick, or a Pantacle of the Science, I'm su re I'm not sure which!

A few well - chosen words about Astrology? Madam, I am only too happy to oblige: our aim is to serve. The customer is usually wrong; but statis - tics indicate that it doesn't pay to tell him so. It seems a long while since I set up your Nativity, and read it, but it is very clear in my mind that you were as tonished, as so many others have been, by the simplicity and correctness of my reading. It began, you remember, by your giving me the usual data when we dropped in for tea at the Anglers' Rest,. I calculated the Ascendant on the spot, and remarked \"Rubbi sh!\" I looked at you again very carefully; and, after many grunts, observed, \"More likely half - past ten --- within an hour one way or the other.\" You insisted; I insisted. Unwilling to make a Fracas in the Inn, we decided to put you to the trouble of wr iting to your mother to settle the dispute. Back came the answer: \"within a few minutes of eleven. I remember because your father had hung on as long as he could --- he had to take the morning service.\" This occurrence is very common in my experience; I have contradicted what sounded like ascertained fact and proved on enquiry to have been right; so, considering that the statistics I made many years ago showed me to have been right 109 times out of 120, I think two things are fairly near probation; first ly, I am not guessing --- that doesn't matter much; but, secondly, which is of supreme importance, there is a definite con - nection between the personal appearance and manner of the native, and"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 144 the Sign of the Zodiac which was rising when he first drew air into his lungs. Let me add, to strengthen the argument, that on the few occasions where I have erred there has been a good astrological reason for it. E.g. I might plump for Pisces rising when it was actually Capricornus; but in that case Saturn would h ave been afflicted by being in Cancer, with bad aspects from Venus and the Moon, thus taking away all his rugged, male, laborious qualities, and in the Ascendant might have been Jupiter, suggesting many of the qualities of Pisces: and so forth. 14 Now let me start! You want me to explain the system --- or no - system! --- which I use. I do not \"move in a mysterious way My wonders to perform;\" for nothing could be simpler. For its origin I have to thank Abramelin the Mage, who empties the vials of his scorn upon the astrologers of his time with their meticulous calculations of \"the hours of the planets\" and so on. I think he goes too far when he says that a planet can have no influence at all, or very little, unless it is above the horizon; but he meant well, bless him! And, though he does not say so, I believe that I do my stuff in very much the same way as he did. Modern astrologers multiply their charts until their desks remind me of a Bargain Basement in the rush hour! They compare and contra st until they are in bat - eyed bewilderment bemused; and when the answer turns out absolutely false, exclaim, what a shout: \"By Ptolemy, I forgot to look at the last Luniation for Buda - Pesth!\" But then they can always find something or other which will exp lain how they came to go wrong:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 145 naturally, when you have several hundred factors, helplessly bound and gagged, it would be just too bad if you couldn't pick out one to serve your turn --- after the event! No, dear girl, it should be obvious to an unweaned brat: (a) they can't see the wood for the trees, (b) they are using Ruach on a proposition which demands Neschamah. Intellect is quite inadequate; the problem requires mother - wit, intuition, understanding. Here is my system in a Number 000 Ampoule. P ut up the figure at birth: study it, make notes of the aspects and dignities, concentrate --- and turn on the Magical Tap! Occasionally, when I began, I set up the \"progressed figure\" to see how the patient was doing this week, but it never seemed to help enough to compensate for the distraction caused by the complication. What I do observe to examine the situation of to - day is Transits. These I have found very reliable; but even with these I usually ignore aspects of minor importance. Truth to tell, co njunctions mean very much more than the rest put together. Talking of aspects, I think it ridiculous to allow vast \"orbs\" like 15Ã¸ for Luna, and 12Ã¸ for Sol. Astrologers go to extreme lengths to calculate the \"solar revolution\" figure not to a degree, no t to a minute, but to a second: and that when they don't know the exact time of birth within half an hour or more! Talk about straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel! Then what does an hour or so matter anyhow, if you are going to allow an aspect, whe ther it is 2Ã¸ or 10Ã¸ off? This even with delicate aspects like the quintile or semi - sextile. What would you think of a doctor who had a special thermometer made to register - 1/100 of a degree, and never took notice of the fact that the patient had just s wallowed a cupful of scalding hot tea? In my own work, I disallow a deviation of 5Ã¸ or 6Ã¸ from the exact aspect,"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 146 unless there is some alien reason for thinking that it is actually opera - tive. With the minor aspects, I dislike reckoning with them if they are even 3Ã¸ away. Nor do I see any sense in marking the odd minutes in the Ascendant, when one is not sure even of the decan. That seems to be about all that is necessary for my \"morning hate;\" suppose we go on to the question of interpretation. 1 5 Thousands of books have been written on Astrology; nobody could possible read them all thoroughly, and he would be a great fool to try. But he may do little harm by going into them far enough to observe that hardly any half - dozen are agreed even on t he foundations of their system, hardly any two upon the meaning of any given aspect, dignity, or posi - tion; there is not always agreement even upon what questions pertain to which houses. There are a few completely quack systems, such as those which mix up the science with Toshosophical4 hypotheses; naturally you discard these. But even of generally acceptable forms of Astrology, such as Mundane and Horary, I tend to be distrustful. I ask, for instance, why, if Taurus rules Poland and Ireland, as is no d oubt the case, the crash and massacres of 1939 e.v. and later in the one did not take place in the other. All the seaports of the world naturally come under one of the three watery signs; but we do not find that an affliction of Pisces, which hits Tunis, should do harm to all the other harbours similarly ruled. "},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 147 This brings us to the first Big Jump in the steeplechase of the whole science. We hear of thousands of people being killed at the same time (within an hour or two, perhaps a minute or two) by eart hquake, ship - wreck, explosion, battle or other form of violence. Was the horoscope of every one of the victims marked with the probability of some such end? I have known very strange cases of coincidence, but not to that extent! The answer, I believe, is manifold. It might be, for example, that Poland and Ireland are ruled by different degrees of Taurus; that there are major and minor figures, the former overruling the latter, so that the figure of the launching of the \"Titanic\" swallowed up the nativi ties of the victims of her wreck. Something of this sort is really an obvious truth. Flood in China, famine in India, pestilence anywhere, evidently depend on maps of a scale far more enormous than the personal. Then --- on this point I feel reasonably sure --- there may be one or more factors of which we know nothing at all, by which the basic possibilities of a figure are set to work. (Just as a car with engine running will not start until the clutch is put in.) I will conclude by announcing a rather remarkable position. 1. I see no objection at all to postulating that certain \"rays,' or other means of transmitting some peculiar form or forms of energy, may reach us from the other parts of the solar system; for we can in fact point to perfectly analogous phenomena in the discoveries of the last hundred years or so. But that is no more than a postulate. 4^ WEH NOTE: By now this term has appeared several times, and it will be going by more than a few times ahead.

He coined the word \"TOSHosophical\" to replace \"Theosophical\" in these references. 16 2. The objections to As trology as such, indicated by what I have already pointed out, and several others, would suffice to place me among the most arrogant disbelievers in the whole study, were it not for what follows. 3. The facts with regard to th e Ascendant are so patent, so undeni - able, and so inexplicable without the postulate in (1), that I am utterly convinced of the fundamental truth of the basic principles of the science. I said, \"I will conclude\"; and I meant it. For now that (or so I hope) you respect sufficiently my conviction that Astrology is a genuine science and not a messy mass of Old Wives' Tales, you will obviously demand instruction as to how to learn it, that you may verify my opinion in the light of you r own experiments. This will look much better if I put it in a separate letter. 'Till then ---  Love is the law, love under will.

They are practically all in The Book of Thoth; but \"i f anyone anything lacks,\" look for it in 777. Then, get a book on Astrology, the older the better. Raphael's Shilling Handbook is probably enough for the present purpose. Get well into your head what the menu says about the natures of the planets, the i nfluence of the aspects, what is meant by dignities, the scope of the houses, and so on. Dovetail all this with your classical knowledge; the character and qualities, the powers and the exploits, of the several deities concerned. Next, learn how to set u p a figure of the heavens. This need not take an average intelligent person more than an hour at the most. You can learn it from a book. Lastly, get Barley's 1001 Notable nativities and More Nativites. Also any other collections available. Practice se tting up the horoscopes. Use the Chaldean square system; it shows at the first glance what is happening in the angular houses, which are the keys of the whole figure. compare and contrast what you know of the natives, from history, with what is said of t he aspects (and the rest) in the books you have read.

Don't be afraid to criticise; on the contrary, do some research work on your own, and find cases which seem to contradict tradition. Instance: Saturn in the M.C. is said to cause a spectacular rise in a man's career , ending in an equally notable crash. Examples: Napoleon I and III, Oscar Wilde, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Northcliffe, Hitler. Look for figures with Saturn thus placed, whose natives have jogged along equably and died in the odour of sanctity. Find out why what worked in some cases failed in the others. By the time you have studied (say) 500 nativities you will be already a fairly competent judge. Work your bloody guns! as Kipling says; get a friend --- just this once I allow you human intercourse --- to s et up for you figures of historical importance, or with some outstanding characteristic (e.g. murderers, champions of sport, statesmen, monsters, philanthropists, heresiarchs) without telling you to whom it refers. Build up the character, profession, stor y from the nativity. It sounds incredible; but more than a score of times I have been actually able to name him! By the time you have got good at this game --- and a most amusing game it is --- you may call yourself a very competent astrologer. Sometime s, even now, you may assign the figure of the Archbishop of York to Jabez Balfour or Catherine de Medici; or mix up Moody and Sankey with Brown and Kennedy; don't be discouraged; perhaps there may be something to be said for you after all!

Again, you can practise this in cafâs, when you visit civilized countries, and it is often possibl e to scrape acquaintance with people who look specially interesting, and do not, as in England, instantly suspect you of dishonourable advances, and get them to play up. This is sometimes easier when you are already with that friend which I was so lax as to allow you; and it is, I own, very helpful to discuss strange faces if only to make it quite clear to your own mind why you decide on one as Virgo, another as Taurus. A strange thing happened once; I had explained all this to the girl that I happened to be living with: that is, I taught her the names of the signs; she knew no Astrology, net even the simple correspondences. After about a month, she was better at it than I was! (\"Why strange?\" you mutter rudely. \"Quite right, my dear! I have always been a wretched reader of character.

If you propose to erect a regular Temple, the most precise instructions in every detail are given in Book 4, Part II. (But I haven't so much as seen a copy for years!) There is a good deal sca ttered about in Part III (Magick, which you have) especially about the four elemental weapons. But if circumstances deny you for the moment the means of carrying out this Aedification as the Ideal would have it, you can certainly do your best to create a fairly satisfactory --- above all, workable --- substitute. (By the way, note the moral aspect of a house, as displayed in our language. \"Edification\" -- \"house - making\": from Latin Aedes, \"house\". \"Economy\" --- \"house - ruling\": from the Greek \"OIKOC\", \" House\" and \"NOMOC\", \"law\".) I was often reduced to such expedients when wandering in strange lands, camping on glaciers, and so on. I fixed it workably well. In Mexico, D.F. for instance, I took my bedroom itself for the Circle, my night - table for the Altar, my candle for the Lamp; and I made the Weapons compact. I had a Wand eight inches long, all precious stones and enamel, to represent the Tree of Life; within, an iron tube containing quick - silver --- very correct, lordly, and damsilly. What a clu b! Also, bought, a silver - gilt Cup; for Air and Earth I made one sachet of rose - petals in yellow silk, and another in green silk packed with salt. In the wilds it was easy, agreeable and most efficacious to make a Circle, and build an altar, of stones; m y Alpine Lantern served admirably for the Lamp. It did double duty when required: e.g. in partaking of the Sacrament of the Four Elements, it served for Fire. But your conditions are not so restricted as this. "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 155 Let us consider what one can do with an ordi nary house, such as you are happy enough to possess. First of all, it is of immense advantage to have a room specially conse - crated to the Work, never used for any other purpose, and never entered by any other person than yourself, unless it were another Initiate, either for inspection or in case you were working together. The aura accumulates with the regularity and frequency of Use. 20 The first point is the Banishing: Everything is to be removed from the room which is not absolutely necessar y to the Work. in this country, one must attend to the heating. An electric stove in the East or the South, is best: it must not need attention. One can usually buy stoves with excellent appropriate symbolism. (Last time I did this --- 13 e.v. --- I g ot a perfect Ferranti at Harrods. The circular copper bowl, with the central Disk as the source of heat, is unsurpas - sable.) The walls should be \"self - coloured,\" a neutral tint --- green, grey or blue - grey? and entirely bare, unless you put up, in the p roper quarters, the proper designs, such as the \"Watch Towers\" --- see The Equinox I, 7. Remember that your \"East,\" your Kiblah, is Boleskine House, which is as near as possible due North from Plymouth. Find North by the shadow of a vertical rod and noon , or by the Pole - Star. Work out the angle as usual. The Stâlâ of Revealing may be just on the N. Wall to make your \"East.\" "},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 156 Next, your Circle. The floor ought to be \"Earth\" green; but white will serve, or black. (A Masonic carpet is not at all bad.) T he Circle it - self should be as shown in Book 4, Part II; but as this volume is probably unavailable, ask me to show you the large painted diagram in my portfolio when next you visit me, and we can arrange for it to be copied. This should then be painted in the correct colours on the floor: the Kether Square to the North, your \"East.\" The Altar must fit exactly the square of Tiphareth; it is best made as a cupboard; of oak or acacia, by preference. It can then be used to hold reserves of incense and othe r requisites. Note that the height of the Altar has to suit your convenience. It is consequently in direct relation with your own stature; in proportion, it is a double cube. This then determines the size of your circle; in fact the entire apparatus and furniture is a geometrical function of yourself. Consider it all as a projection of yourself in terms of these conventional formulae. (A convention does really mean \"that which is convenient.\" How abject, then to obey a self - styled convention which is actually as inconvenient as possible!) Next, the Lamp. This may be of silver, or silver - gilt, (to represent the Path of Gimel) and is to be hung from the ceiling exactly above the centre of the altar. There are plenty of old church lamps which serve very well. The light is to be from a wick in a floating cork in a glass of olive oil. (I hope you can get it!) It is really desirable to make this as near the \"Ever - burning Lamp of the Rosicrucians\" as possible; it is not a drawback that this implies freque nt attention. Now for the Weapons! The Wand.

What ingenuity of \"considerations!\" With what fatally sure steps marches his preparation! With what superb tech - niq ue does he carry out his energized enthusiasm! And, finally, with what exact judicial righteousness does he sum the results of his great Evocation of Apollonius of Tyana! "},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 166 Contrast with this elaborate care, rightness of every detail, earnestness and inten tness upon the goal --- contrast, I say, the modern Spiritist in the dingy squalor of her foul back street in her suburban slum, the room musty, smelling of stale food, the hideous prints, the cheap and rickety furniture, calling up any one required from J esus Christ to Queen Victoria, 6* Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, by Eliphas Lâvi. 26 all at a bob - a - nob! Faugh! Let us return to clean air, and analyse Lâvi's experiment; I believe that by the application of the principles set forth in my ot her letters on Death and Reincarnation, it will be simple to explain his par - tial failure to evoke Apollonius. You had better read them over again, to have the matter clear and fresh in your mind. Now then, let me call you attention to the extreme care which Lâvi took to construct a proper Magical Link between himself and the Ancient Master. Alas! It was rather a case of building with bricks made without straw; he had not at his command any fresh and vital object pertaining intimately to Apollonius. A \"relic\" would have been immensely helpful, especially if it had been consecrated and re - consecrated through the centuries by devout veneration. This, incidentally, is the great advantage that one may often obtain when invoking Gods; their images, constant ly revered, nourished by continual sacrifice, serve as a receptacle for the Prana driven into them by thousands or millions of worshippers. In fact, such idols are often already consecrated talismans; and their possession and daily use is at least two - thi rds of the battle. "},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 167 Apollonius was indeed as refractory a subject as Lâvi could possibly have chosen. All the cards were against him. Why? Let me remind you of the sublimity of the man's genius, and the extent of his attainment. Apollonius must certain ly have made the closest links between his Ruach and his Supernal Triad, and this would have gone seeking a new incarnation elsewhere. All the available Ruach left float - ing around in the Akasha must have been comparatively worthless odds and ends, true Qlippoth or \"Shells of the Dead\" --- just those parts of him, in a word, which Apollonius would have deliberately discarded at his death. So what use would they be to Lâvi? Even if there were among them a few such elements as would serve his purpose, they would have been devitalized and frittered away by the mere lapse of the centuries, since they had lost connection with the reality of the Sage. Alternatively, they might have been caught up and adopted by some wandering Entity, quite probably some malign ant demon. Qlipoth --- Shells of the Dead --- Obsessing Spirits! Here we are back in the pestilent purlieus of Walham Green, and the frowsty atmosphere of the frowsy \"medium\" and the squalid sâance. \"Look! but do not speak to them!\" as Virgil warned Dan te. So let us look. No! Let us first congratulate ourselves that this subject of Necromancy is so admirably documented. As to the real Art, we have not only Eliphas Lâvi, but the sublimely simple account in the Old Testament of the Witch of Endor, her conjuring up of the apparition of Samuel to King Saul. A third classic must not be neglected: I have heard or read the story else - where --- for the moment I cannot place it. But it is so brilliantly told in I Write as I Please by Walter Duranty that not hing could be happier than to quote him verbatim. "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 168 \"It was the story of a Bolshevik who conversed with a corpse. He told it to me himself, and undoubtedly believed it, although he was an average tough Bolshevik who naturally disbelieved in Heaven and Hell and a Life beyond the Grave. This man was doing 'underground' revolutionary work in 27 St. Petersburg when the War broke out; but he was caught by the police and exiled to the far north of Siberia. In the second winter of the War he escaped from his prison camp and reached an Eskimo village where they gave him shelter until the spring. They lived, he said, in beastly condi - tions, and the only one whom he could talk to was the Shaman, or medicine man, who knew a little Russian. The Shaman once boasted that he could foretell the future, which my Bolshevik friend ridiculed. The next day the Shaman took him to a cave in the side of a hill in which there was a big transparent block of ice enclosing the naked body of a man --- a white man, not a nat ive --- apparently about thirty years of age with no sign of a wound anywhere. The man's head, which was clean - shaven, was outside the block of ice; the eyes were closed and the features were European. The shaman then lit a fire and burnt some leaves, thr ew powder on them muttering incantations, and there was a heavy aromatic smoke. He said in Russian to the bolshevik, 'Ask what you want to know.' The Bolshevik spoke in German; he was sure that the Shaman knew no German, but he was equally sure he saw th e lips move and heard it answer, clearly, in German. He asked what would happen to Russia, and what would happen to him. From the moving lips of the corpse came the reply that Russia would be defeated in war and that there would be a revolution; the Tzar would be captured"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 169 by his enemies and killed on the eve of rescue; he, the Bolshevik, would fight in the Revolution but would suffer no harm; later, he would be wounded fighting a foreign enemy, but would recover and live long.\" \"The Bolshevik did not real ly believe what he had seen although he was certain that he had seen it. I mean that he explained it by hypnotism or auto - suggestion or something of the kind; but it was true, he said, that he passed unscathed through the Revolution and the Civil War and was wounded in the Polish War when the Red Army recovered Kiev.\" So also we are most fortunate in possessing the account almost beyond Heart's desire of Spiritism, in Robert Browning's Mr. Sludge the Medium. You see that I write \"Spiritism\" not \"Spiritual ism.\" To use the latter word in this connection is vulgar ignorance; it denotes a system of philosophy which flourished (more or less) is the Middle Ages --- read your Erdmann if you want the gruesome details. But why should you? The model for Mr. Sludg e was David Dunbar (? Douglas) Home, who was really quite a distinguished person in his way, and succeeded in pulling some remarkably instructed and blue - blooded legs. Personally, I believe him to have been genuine, getting real results through pacts with elementals, demons or what not; for when he was in Paris, arrangements were made for him to meet Eliphas Lâvi; forthwith \"he abandoned the unequal contest, and fled in terror from the accursed spot.\" What annoyed Browning was that he had added to his col lection of \"Femora I have pulled\", those appendages of Elizabeth Barrett; and where R.B. was there was no room for anyone else --- as in the case of Allah! R.B. was accordingly as spiteful as he could be, and that was not a little. It is not fair to tar a ll mediums with the Sludge brush; there are many"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 170 who could advance quite sincerely some of the apologia of Sludge. Why should a medium be immune to self - deception spurred by the Wish - Fiend? While there are people walking about outside the Bug - house who ca n find Mrs. Simpson and Generals de Gaulle, Franco, Allenby, Montgomery and who else in the \"Centuries\" of Nostradamus, we should be stupid to assign everything to conscious fraud. 28 In that case what about poor Tiny Aleister? Do please allow me the happy young Eagles of the Old Testament; what clearer prophecy of psychoanalysis, it's only the English for Freud and Jung and Adler! No, by no means always fraud. Yet at any sâance the \"investigators\" take no magical precautions soever --- against, say, the impersonation of Iophiel by Hismael, or the Doves of Venus by the A'arab Zareq. All they attempt especially at \"demonstrations\" and \"materializations,\" is to guard with great elaboration and (as a rule) complete futility against the deceptions o f the common conjuror. They are not expecting any genuine manifestation of the \"Spirit World;\" and this fact makes clear their true subconscious attitude. As for those mediums who possess magical ability, they almost always come from the most ignorant cl asses --- Celts are an exception to this rule --- and have no knowledge whatever of the technique of the business. Worse, they are usually of the type that delights in the secret dirty affinities, and so naturally and gladly attract entities of the Qlipho thic world to their magical circle.

The hollow shells glow with infernal fire . Also, of course, they soak up vitality from the sitters, and from the medium herself. Altogether, a most poisonous performance. And what do they get out of it? Even when the \"Spirits\" are really spirits, they only stuff the party up with a lot of tra shy lies.

Many of such thaumaturgic phenomena contain elements of illusion in greater or less degree; if the maraclee's mind is 100% responsible, I think the business becomes a mere conjuring trick. My dictionary defines the verb: \"to charm, to enchant; to act on by some irresistible influence; to captivate; to excite and allure irresistibly or powerfully.\" For the noun it gets even deeper into technical Magic {sic}: \"the act or power of fascinating or spell binding, often to one's harm; a mysterious, irre - sistible, alluring influence.\" (Personally, I have always used, or heard, it much less seriously: \"attractive\" hard ly more). Skeat, sur - prisingly, is almost dumb: p. part. of \"to enchant\" and \"from L. fascinum, a spell.\" Yes, surprisingly; for the word is one of the many that means the Phallus. The implication is that there is some sexual element in the exciting and alluring quality, which lifts it altogether above mere \"pleasing.\" To my mind the implication is that there is some quality inherent which is cognate to that too totally irrational quasimagnetic force which has been responsible not only for innumerable p ersonal tragedies --- and comedies --- but for the fall of dynasties and even the wreck of Empires. \"Christ\" is reported as having said: \"If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto me.\" Interpret this in the light of the Cross as a Phalli c emblem, and --- how lurid a flash!

But be car eful not to overdo it; for if the source of the perfume is recognized the consciousness takes charge, and the result is antipathy. Many years ago I composed a scent based on similar principles, which I intended to market under the title \"Potted Sex Appeal .\" We tried it out with the assistance of a certain noble Marquess, whose consequent mis - adventures --- won't he laugh when he reads this! But there are other senses: \"l'amour de l'oreille\" may refer not only to Othello's way of snaring Desdemona, but s ubtleties of timbre in the voice...

I realized I was alone; and thinking he was dead or gone --- or some other terrible thing --- I lost consciousness.\" This discourse has been thus left unfinished: but it is only necessary to add that the capacity to extract such spiritual honey from these un - promising flowers is the mark of an adept who has perfected his Magick Cup. This method of Qabalistic exegesis is one of he best ways of exalting the reason to the higher consciousness. Evidently it started Fra. P. so that in a moment he becom e completely concentrated and entranced. Note that this has nothing at all to do with any Pranayama. It seems a matter of ecstatic concentration, which chose this mode of expression instead of bringing on Samadhi --- though that, too, occurred in some of the cases. By the way, there is a fairly full account of the whole business; I have just remembered --- it is in my Autohagiography. \"Pranayama produced, firstly, a peculiar kind of perspiration; secondly, an automatic rigidity of the muscles; and third ly, the very curious phenomenon of causing the body, while still absolutely rigid, to take little hops in various directions. It seems as if one were somehow raised, possibly an inch from the ground, and deposited very gently a short dis - tance away.

When Allan was meditating, it was my duty to bring his food very quietly (from time to time) into the room adjoining that where he was working. One day he missed two successive meals, and I thought I ought to loo k into his room to see if all was well. I must explain that I have known only two European women and three European men who could sit in the attitude called Padmasana, which is that usually seen in seated images of the Buddha. Of these men, Allan was one . He could knot his legs so well that, putting his hands on the ground, he could swing his body to and fro in the air between them. When I looked into his room I found him not seated on his meditation mat, which was in the centre of the room at the end fa rthest from the window, but in a distant corner ten or twelve feet off, still in his knotted position, resting on his head and right shoulder, exactly like an image overturned. I set him right way up, and he came out of his trance. He was quite unconscio us that anything unusual had happened. But he had evidently been thrown there by the mysterious forces generated by Pranayama. \"There is no doubt whatever about this phenomenon; it is quite common. But the Yogis claim that the lateral motion is due to la ck of balance, and that if one were in perfect spiritual equilibrium one would rise directly in the air. I have never seen any case of levitation, and hesitate to say that it has happened to me, thought I have actually been seen by others, on several occa sions, apparently poised in the air. For the first three phenomena I have found no difficulty in devising quite simple physiologi - 32 "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 178 cal explanations. But I can form no theory as to how the practice could counteract the force of gravitation, and I am unregenerate enough to allow this to make me sceptical about the occurrence of levitation. Yet, after all, the stars are suspended in space. There is no ... priori reason why the forces which prevent them rushing together should not come into operati on in respect of the earth and the body.\" The Allan part of this is the best evidence at my disposal. He couldn't have got where he did by hopping, and he couldn't have got into that position intentionally; he must have been levitated, lost balance, and dropped upside down. In any case, there is no trace of fascination about it, as there may have been in Soror Virakam's observation. About invisibility, now? Of this I have so much experience that the merest outline could take us far beyond the limits of a letter. In Mexico D.F., I worked at acquiring the power by means of ritual. I worked desper - ately hard. I got to the point where my image in a pier - glass flickered, rather like the very earliest films did. Possibly more work, after more skill had c ome to me, might have done the whole trick. But I did not persist when I found out how to do it by fascination. (Here we are at last!) Roughly, this is how to do it. If one is concentrated to the point when what you are thinking of is the only reality i n the Universe, when you lose all awareness of who and where you are and what you are doing, it seems as though that unconsciousness were in some way contagious. The people around you just can't see anybody. At one time, in Sicily, this happened nearly e very day.

Suddenly he lost sight of me, and actually cried out in alarm. I said: \"What's wrong?\" That broke the spell; there I was, all present and correct. Did I hear you mutter \"Transmutations? Werwolves? Golden Hawks?\" Likely enough; it's time we touched o n that. In certain types of animal there appears, if tradition have any weight, to be a curious quality of --- sympathy? I doubt if that be the word, but can think of none better --- which enables them to assume at times the human form. No. 1 --- and th e rest are also rans --- is the seal. There is a whole body of literature about this. Then come wolves, hyaenas, large dogs of the hunting type; occasionally leopards. Tales of cats and serpents are usually the other way round; it is the human (nearly a lways female) that assumes these shapes by witchcraft. But in ancient Egypt they literally doted on this sort of thing. The papyri are full of formulas for operating such transmutations. But I think that this was mostly to afford some relaxa - tion for t he spirit of the dead man; he nipped out of his sarcophagus, and painted the town all the colours of the rainbow in one animal shape or another. 33 The only experience I have of anything of this sort was when I was in Pacific waters, mostly at Hon olulu or in Nippon.

I was to visit her, and the token of perfect success was to be that I should knock a vase off the mantel - piece. We appointed certain days and hours --- with some awkward - ness, as my time - distance from her was constantly growing shorter --- for me to pay my visit. We got some remarkable results; our records of the inter - view used to tally with surprising accuracy; but the vase remained intact ! This is not one of my notorious digressions; and this is how transmu - tation comes into it. I found that by first taking the shape of a golden hawk, and resuming my own form after landing in her \"temple\" --- a room she had fitted ad hoc --- the whole o peration became incomparably easier. I shall not indulge in hypotheses of why this should have been the case. A little over four years later --- in the meantime we had met and worked at Magick together --- we resumed these experiments in a somewhat differ ent form. The success was much greater; but though I could move her, and even any objects which she was touching, I could make no impression on inanimate objects at a distance from her. The behaviour of her dogs, and of her cat, was very curious and inte resting. Strangest of all, there appeared those \"kinks in Time\" which profane science is just beginning to discuss. Example: on one occasion our records of an \"interview\" agreed with quite extraordinary precision; but, on comparing notes, it was found th at owing to some stupid miscalculation of mine, it was all over in Hong Kong some hours before I had started from Honolulu! Again, don't ask me why, or how, or anything!

I was living at 125 Victoria Street, in a studio converted into a Temp le by means of a Circle, an Altar and the rest. West of the Altar was a big fireplace with a fender settee; the East wall was covered with bookshelves. Enter the late Theodor Reuss, O.H.O. and Frater Superior of the O.T.O. He wanted me to join that Orde r. I recommended him, in politer language to repeat the Novocastrian Experi - ment. Undeterred, he insisted: \"But you must.\" (Now we go back, or forward, I know not which, to a night when I found myself stranded in London. I asked hospitality of a strang er; it was readily afforded. Some hours later my hostess fell asleep; I could not do so; something was nagging me. I suddenly took my notebook, and wrote a certain passage in a certain book, since published.) \"Must, my foot!\" He persisted: \"You have pu blished the secret of the nth degree of O.T.O., and you must take the corresponding oaths.\" \"I have done nothing of the sort. I don't know the secret. I don't want to know it. I don't . . . \" He interrupted me; he strode across the room; he plucked a book from the shelves; he opened it; he thrust it under my nose; he pointed out a passage with a minatory index. I began to stammer. \"Yes, I wrote that. I don't know what it means; I don't like it; I only put it in because it was written in rather curiou s cir - cumstances, and I was too lazy --- or perhaps a little afraid --- to reject it and write what I wanted.\" He fastened on one point: \"You don't know what it means?\" I repeated that I did not, even now that he had claimed 34 it as important. He explained it to me, as to a child. I was merely"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 182 surprised; it didn't sound possible. (Sister, all this while I've been lying to you like an Archbishop; it is connected wit fascinations; indeed, it has very little to do with anything else!) Finally, he won me over, I went down to his G.H.Q., took the Oaths, was installed in the Throne of the XÃ¸ of O.T.O. as National Sovereign Grand Master General, and began to establish the Order as a going concern. Well, you say, that is a very simple story, nothing specially hard to believe in it. True, but consider the dates. That scene in Victoria Street, is as clear and vivid in my mind, in every detail, as if it were yesterday. That secret is published only in that passage of that book. And --- the book was not published until three years later, and from an address of which in 1910 I had not so much as thought of. The date of my adhesion to the O.T.O. (which, by the way, upset every principle and plan that I had ever held) is equally certain by virtue of sub sequent published writings. Now go away and explain that! Well I've given you a fair account of some of the principal fascinations; as to the rest, bewitchments, sorceries, inhibitions and all that lot, it is enough if I say that they follow the regular Laws of Magick; in some, fascination proper plays a prominent part; in others, it is barely more than walking on to say \"My lord, the carriage waits!\" But - -- even that can be done well or ill, and a small mistake may work a mighty mischief.

For one thing, its subject - matter includes the whole of philosophy, from ontology and metaphysics down to natural history. More, the most rarefied and recon - dite of these has a direct bearing upon the conduct of life in its most material details, and the simplest study of such apparently earthbound matters as botany and mineralogy leads to the most abstruse calculations of the imponderables. With what weapons, then, are we to attack so formidable a fortress? The first essential is clear thinking. In a previous letter I have dealt to some extent with this subject; but it is so important that you must forgive me if I return to it, and 35 that at length, from the outset , and in detail. Let us begin but having our own minds clear of all ambiguities, ignoring for the purpose of this argument all metaphysical subtleties.7 I want to confine it to the outlook of the \"plain man.\" What do we do when we \"think?\" There are tw o operations, and only two, possible to thought.

You can examine A, and find that it is composed of B and C. A = B + C. 2. You can find out what happens to B when you add C to it. B + C = A. As you notice, the two are identical, after all; but the process is different. Example: Raise Copper Oxide to a very high temperature; you obtain metallic copper and oxygen gas. Heat copper in a stream of oxygen; you obtain copper oxide. You can complicate such experiments indefinitely, as when o ne analyzes coal - tar, or synthesizes complex products like quinine from its elements; but one can always describe what happens as a series of simple operations, either of the analytical or the synthetic type. (I wonder if you remember a delightful passage in Anatole France where he interprets an \"exalted\" mystical statement, first by giving the words their meaning as concrete images, when he gets a magnificent hymn, like a passage from the Rig - Veda; secondly, by digging down to the original meaning, with a n effect comical and even a little ribald. I fear I have no idea where to find it; in one of the \"odds and ends\" compilations most likely. So please, look somebody; you won't have wasted your time!) This has been put in a sort of text, because the first stumbling - block to study is the one never has any certainty as to what the author means, or thinks he means, or is trying to persuade one that he means. Try something simple: \"The soul is part of God.\" Now then, when he writes \"soul\" does he mean Atma, or Buddhi, or the Higher Manas, or Purusha, or Yechidah,or Neschamah, or Nepheshch, or Nous, or Psyche, or Phren, or Ba, or Khu, or Ka, or Animus, or Anima, or Seele, or what?

The fact is that very few of us know what words mean; fewer still take the trouble to enquire. We calmly, we carelessly assume that our minds are identical with that of the writer, at least on that point; and then we wonder that there should be misunderstandings! The fact is (again!) that usually we don't really want to know; it is so very much easier to dri ft down the river of discourse, \"lazily, lazily, drowsily, drowsily, In the noonday sun\". Why is this so satisfactory? Because although we may not know what a word means, most words have a pleasant or unpleasant connotation, each for himself, either beca use of the ideas or images thus begotten, of hopes or memories stirred up, or merely for the sound of the word itself.

I think one may take it that the good writer makes use of such artifice to make his meaning clear; the bad writer to obscure it, or to conceal the fact that he has none. One of the best items of the education system at the Abbey in Cefal â was the weekly Essay. Everyone, including children of five or six, had to write on \"The Housing Problem,\" \"Why Athens Decayed,\" \"The Marriage System,\" \"Buddhist Ethics\" and the like; the subject didn't matte r much; the point was that one had to discover, arrange and condense one's ideas about it, so as to present it in a given number of words, 93 or 156, or 418 as like as not, that number, neither more nor less. A superb disci - pline for any writer. I had a marvellous lesson myself some years earlier. I had cut down a certain ritual of initiation to what I thought were the very barest bones, chiefly to make it easy to commit to memory. Then came a candidate who was deaf --- not merely \"a little hard of hea ring;\" his tympana were rup - tured --- and the question was How? All right for most of it; one could show him the words typed on slips. But during part of the ceremony he was hoodwinked; one was reduced to the deaf - and - dumb alphabet devised for such occa sions. I am as clumsy and stupid at that as I am at most things, and lazy, infernally lazy, on top of that.

This is where clean thinking --- a subject whose fringes I seem to remember having touched --- wins the Gold Medal of the Royal Humane Society. It is surely the wis e course to accept the plain facts; to try to explain them away, or to excuse them, is certain to involve one in a maelstrom of sophistry; and when, despite these laudable efforts, the facts jump up and land a short jab to the point, one is even worse off than before. This has to be said, because Sammasati is assuredly one of the most useful, as well as one of the most trustworthy and most manageable, weapons in the armoury of the Aspirant. You stop me, obviously with a demand for a personal explanation. \"How is it,\" you write, \"that you reject with such immitigable scorn the very foundation - stones of Buddhism, and yet refer disciples enthusiasti - cally to the technique of some of its subtlest super - structures?\" I laff."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 188 It is the old, old story. When t he Buddha was making experiments and recording the results, he was on safe ground: when he started to theorize, committing (incidentally) innumerable logical crimes in the process, he is no better a guesser than the Arahat next door, or for the matter of t hat, the Arahat's Lady Char. So, if you don't mind, we will look a little into this matter of Samma - sati: what is it when it's at home? It may be no more than a personal fancy, but I think Allan Bennett's translation of the term, \"Recollection,\" is as n ear as one can get in English. One can strain the meaning slightly to include Re - collection, to imply the ranging of one's facts, and the fitting of them into an organized structure. The term \"sati\" suggests an identification of Being with Knowledge --- see The Soldier and the Hunchback ! -- ! and ? (Equinox I, 1). So far as it applies to the Magical Memory, it lays stress on some such expedient, very much as is explained in Liber Thisarb (Magick, pp. 415 - 422). But is it not a little strange that \"The Abomination of Desolation should be set up in the Holy Place,\" as it were? Why should the whole - bearted search for Truth and Beauty disclose such hateful and such hideous elements as necessary components of the Absolute Perfection?

He discovered, and he demonstrated, that the history of any animal throughout the course of its evolution is repeated in the stages of the individual. To put it crudely, the growth of a child from the fertilized ovum to the adult repeats the adventures of its species. This doctrine is tremendously important, and I feel that I do not know how to emphasize it as it deserves. I want to be exceptionally accurate; yet the use of his meticulous scientific terms, with an armoury of quotations, would almost certainly result in your missing the point, \"unable to see the wood for the trees.\" Let me put it that the body is formed by the super - position of layers, each representing a stage in the history of the evolution of the species.

The ready - to - hand, recent fugi - tive thoughts come first and fir st they go. Then the events of the previous day or so, and the preoccupations of the mind for that period. Next, one comes to the layer of reveries and other forms of wish - phanstasm; then cryptomnesia gets busy with incidents of childhood and the like; f inally, there intrudes the class of \"atmospherics,\" where one cannot trace the source of the interruption. All these are matters of the conscious rational mind; and when I explored and classified these facts, in the very first months of my serious prac - t ice of Yoga, I had no suspicion that they were no more than the foam on a glass of champagne: nay, rather of \"black wine in jars of jade 39 Cooled all these months in hoarded snow, Black wine with purple starligh t in its bosom, Oily and sweet as the soul of a brown maid Brought from the forenoon's archipelago, Her brows bound bright with many a scarlet blossom Like the blood of the slain that flowered free When we met the black men knee to knee.\" How apt the verses are!

(Capitals, please, or bang on something; that has got to sink in.) Just as your body was at one stage the body of an ape, a fish, a frog (and all the rest of it) so did that animal at that stage possess a mind correlative. Now then! In the course of that kind of initiation conferred by Samma - sati, the layers are stripped off very much as happens in elementary meditation (Dharana) to the conscious mind. (There is a way of acquiring a great deal of strange and unsuspected knowledge of these matters by the use of Sulphuric Ether, [C2H5]2O, according to a special technique.

You ask whether these remarks do not conflict with my repeated definition of Initiation as the Way In. Not at all; the Inmost is identical with the All. As you travel inward, you become a ble to perceive all the layers which surround the \"Self\" from within, thus enlarging the scope of your vision of the Universe. It is like moving from a skirmishing patrol to G.H.Q.; and the object of so doing is obviously to exercise constantly increasing control over the whole Army. Every step in rank enables you both to see more and to do more; but one's attention is inevitably directed outward. When the entire system of the Universe is conterminous with your compre - hension, \"inward\" and \"outward\" be come identical. But it won't do at all to seek anything within but a point of view, for the simple reason that there is nothing else there! It is just like all those symbols in The Book of Thoth; as soon as you get to the \"end\" of anything, you suddenly find it is the \"beginning.\" To formulate the idea of \"self\" at all, you must posit limitations; any - thing that is distinguishable is a mere temporary (and arbitrary) selection of the finite from the infinite; whatever you chose to think 42 of, it changes, it grows, it disappears.

It was in the Blossoms of Springtide, and in the chilling winds that swept over from Siberia, and in the Wi ld Geese that it bore Southward when their instinct bade them. In short, the catalogue began to look is if it were going to extend indefinitely; and an impatient disciple, pointing to certain traces left by a mule in its recent passage, asked: \"And is the Tao also in that?\" The Master nodded, and echoed: \"Also in that.\" . . . .  . . . .

Good: the field is clear for an enquiry into this word \"God\". We find ourselves in trouble from the start. We must define; and to define is to limit; and to limit is to reduce \"God\" to \"a God\" or at best \"the God\". He must be omnis cient ({symbol of alchemical mercury}) omnipotent, ({Al. Sulfur}) and omnipresent ({Al. Salt}); yet to such a Being no purpose would be possible; so that all the apol - ogies for the existence of \"evil\" crash. If there be opposites of any kind, there can b e no consistency. He cannot be Two; He must be One; 50 yet, as is obvious, he isn't. How do the Hindu philosophers try to get out of this quag? \"Evil\" is \"illusion;\" has no \"real\" existence. Then what is the point of it? They say \"Not that, no t that!\" denying to him all attributes; He is \"that which is without quantity or quality.\" They contradict themselves at every turn; seeking to remove limit, they remove definition. Their only refuge is in \"superconsciousness.\" Splendid! but now \"belief \" has disappeared altogether; for the word has no sense unless it is subject to the laws of normal thought...Tut! you must be feeling it yourself; the further one goes, the darker the path.

True, it's a slogan of A.'.

But it also implies a binding together i.e. of ideas; in fact, a \"body of doctrine.\" Not a bad expression. A religion t hen, is a more or less coherent and consistent set of beliefs, with precepts and prohibitions therefrom deducible. But then there is the sense in which Frazer (and I) often use the word: as in opposition to \"Science\" or \"Magic\". Here the point is that re ligious people attribute phenomena to the will of some postulated Being or Beings, placable and moveable by virtue of sacrifice, devotion, or appeal.

(You remember how this happened, and what came of it, in a rather clever short story by H.G.

To sum up, our system is a religion just so far as a religion mean s an enthusiastic putting - together of a series of doctrines, no one of which must in any way clash with Science or Magick. Call it a new religion, then, if it so please your Gracious Majesty; but I confess that I fail to see what you will have gained by s o doing, and I feel bound to add that you might easily cause a great deal of misunderstanding, and work a rather stupid kind of mischief.

Here (you put it in your more elegant prose) we ha ve a Yogi, nay more, a Paramahamsa, a Bodhisattva of the best: yea, further, we have a Master of the Temple --- and is not his Motto \"Vi veri vniversom vivus vici?\" and yet we find him fussing like an old hen over the most trivial of troubles; we find him wrapped in the lacustrine vapours of Avernus, fretting himself into a fever about imagi - nary misfortunes at which no normal person would do more than cast a contemptuous glance, and get on with the job. Yes, although you can scarcely evade indictment for unnecessarily employ - ing the language of hyperbole, I see what you mean. Yet the answer is adequate; the very terms of his Bargain with Destiny not only allow for, but imply, some such reaction on the part of the Master to the Bludgeon - ings of Fate. ( W. E. Henley15) There are two ways of looking at the problem. One is what I may call the mathematical.

To \"snap out of it\" and recover my normal serenity requires only a minute effort, and the whole of my m agical energy is earmarked for the Great Work. I have none left to make that effort. Of course, if the worry is enough to interfere with that Work, I must detail a corporal's file to abate the nuisance. The other way may be called the Taoist aspect. Fi rst, however, let me explain the point of view of the Master of the Temple, as it is so similar. You should remember from your reading what happens in this Grade. The new Master is \"cast out\" into the sphere appropriate to the nature of his own particula r Great Work. And it is proper for him to act in true accordance with the nature of the man as he was when he passed through that Sphere (or Grade) on his upward journey. Thus, if he be cast out into 3Ã¸ = 8Ã¾, it is no part of his work to aim at the virtu es of a 4Ã¸ = 7Ã¾; all that has been done long before. It is no business of his to be bothering his head about anything at all but his Work; so he must react to events as they occur in the way natural to him without trying to \"improve himself.\" (This, of c ourse, applies not only to worry, but to all his funny little ways.) The Taoist position differs little, but it is independent of all consi - derations of the man's attainment; it is an universal rule based on a particular theory of things in general. Thu s, \"benevolence and right - eousness\" are not \"virtues;\" they are only symptoms of the world - disease, in that they should be needed. The same applies to all conditions, and to all modes of seeking to modify them. There is only one proper reaction"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 216 to event ; that is, to adjust oneself with perfect elasticity to whatever happens. That tiger across the paddy - field looks hungry. There are several ways of dealing with the situation. One can run away, or climb a tree, or shoot him, or (in your case) cow him by the Power of the Human Eye; but the way of the Tao is to take no particular notice. (This, incidentally, is not such bad Magick; the diversion of your attention might very well result in your becoming invisible, as I have explained in a previous letter.) The theory appears to be that, although your effort to save yourself is successful, it is bound to create a disturbance of equili - brium elsewhere, with results equally disastrous. Even more so; it might be that to be eaten by a tiger is just what you n eeded in your career through the incarnations; at that moment there might well be a vacancy somewhere exactly where it will do most good to your Great Work. When you press on one spot, you make a corresponding bulge in another, as we often see a beautiful lady, unhappy about her waist - line, adopt drastic measures, and transform herself into the semblance of a Pouter Puffin! In theory, I am particularly pleased about this Method, because it goes for everybody, requires no knowledge, no technical training, \"no nuffin.\" All the same, it won't do for me, except in a much modified form, and in very special cases; because no course of action (or inaction) is conceivable that would do great violence to my nature. So let me worry along, please, with the accent on the \"along;\" I will grin and bear it, or, if it gets so bad that I can't do my Work, I will make the necessary effort to abate the nuisance, always most careful to do as little damage as possible to the main current of my total Energy.

Yours fraternally,  666 CHAPTER XXXIII  THE GOLDEN MEAN Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the w hole of the Law. You would think that one who like myself has the Sun, the Lord of His Horoscope, in Libra, with Venus who rules that sign in close conjunction with him, with Saturn trine, Uranus sextile, Mars square and Luna quincunx to him, would wear t he Golden Mean as a breastplate, flaunt it on my banneret, quarter it on my escutcheon, and grave it on the two - edged blade of my thrice trusty falchion! Just so, objects that instinct itself! \"Had you been born a few hours earlier, with Aries rising, its lord Mars aggravated by the square of Sol and Venus, you would indeed have bee a Wild Man of the Woods, arro - gant, bigoted, domineering, incapable of seeing a second side to any question, headstrong, haughty, a seething hell - broth of hate; and this fact disables your judgment.\" All perfectly true. My equable nature is congenitally hostile to extreme measures, except in imagination. I cannot bear sudden violent movements. Climbing rocks, people used to say that I didn't climb them, that I oozed over the m!

It answers your question about the value to be attached to this Golden Mean. There is no rule about it; your own attitude is proper for yourself, and has no value for anybody else. But you must make sure exactly what that attitude actually is, deep d own. Let us go back for a moment to the passage above quoted. The text goes on to give the reason for the facts. \"Because of me in Thee which thou knewest not. for why? Because thou wast the knower, and me.\" (AL II, 12 - 13) The unexpected use or dis use of capitals, the queer syntax, the unintelligibility of the whole passage: these certainly indicate some profound Qabalistic import in these texts. So we had better mark that Strictly Private, and forget it. One point, however, we have forgotten: alt hough my Libra inclinations do bias me personally, they also make me fair - minded, \"a judge, and a good judge too\" in the memorable phrase of the late William Schwenk Gilbert. So I will sum up what is to be said for and against this Golden Mean. As usual, nobody has taken the trouble to define the term. We know that it was extolled by both the Greek and the Chinese philosophers; but I 55 cannot see that they meant much more than to counsel the avoidance of extremes, whether of measures or of opinio ns; and to advocate modera - tion in all things.

It is unlikely that either you or I should come upon a copy of Max Beerbohm's portrait of Mathew Arnold; but Raven Hill's famous car - toon is history, and can be told as such without the illustration. We shall have to go into the matter, because of your very just criticism of my magical writings in general --- and these letters, being colloquial, are naturally an extreme case. Far - off indeed those sunny days when life in England was worth living; when one could travel anywhere in Europe --- excep t Russia and Turkey, which spiritually, at least, are in Asia --- or America, without a pass - port; when we complained that closing time was twelve - thirty a.m.; when there was little or no class bitterness, the future seemed secure, and only Nonconformists failed to enjoy the fun that bubbled up on every side. Well, in those days there were Music - halls; I can't hope to explain to you what they were like, but they were jolly. (I'm afraid that there's another word beyond the scope of your universe!)

But the enemies of life were on guard. They saw people enjoying them - selves, (shame!) and they raked through the mildewed parchments of obsolete laws un til they found some long - forgotten piece of mischief that might stop it. The withered husks of womanhood, idle, frustrated, spiteful and malignant, called up their forces, blackmailed the Church into supporting them, and began a senseless string of prosec utions.

Against this risk we look to our insurance; there are two infallible: Common Sense and the Sense of Humour. When you are lying exhausted and exenterate after the attainment of Vishvarupadarshana it is all wrong to think: \"Well, now I'm the holiest man in the world, of course with the exception of John M.

Herbert's Holy Deadlock; he makes a Mantram of it! \"I put it to you --- I put it to you --- I put it to you --- that you have got a boil on your bottom.\" To this rule there is, as usual with rules, an exception. Some states of mind are of the same structure as poetry, where the \"one step from the sublime to the ridiculous\" is an easy and fatal step. But even so, peda ntry is as bad as ribaldry. Personally, I have tried to avoid the dilemma by the use of poetic language and form; for instance, in AHA! It is all difficult, dammed difficult; but if it must be that one's most sacred shrine be profaned, let it be the clea n assault of laughter rather than the slimy smear of sactimoniousness!

Nay, but after When the song's light dissolves gently in laughter.\" Oh! \"One word more\" as Browning said, and poured forth the most puerile portentous piffle about that grim blue - stocking \"interesting invalid,\" his spouting wife.

I would add this: that I have not yet heard of anyone who has attained to any results of importance who does not attribute his success to devotion of quite similar quality. Here they are: 1. The Cloud on the Sanctuary. On reading this book, Mr. X., who was desperate from the conviction that no success in life wa s worth a tinker's dam, decided: \"This is the answer to my problem; the members of the Secret Fraternity which this book describes have solved the riddle of life. I must discover them, and seek to be received amongst them.\" 2. X., hearing a conversation in a cafâ which made him think that the speaker might be such an one as he sought, hunted him down - -- he had gone on his travels --- caught him, and made him promise an interview at the earliest possible date. 3. This interview leading to an introducti on to the Fraternity, he joined it, pledging his fealty. But he was grievously shocked, and nearly withdrew, when assured: \"There is nothing in this Oath which might conflict in any way with your civil, moral or religious obliga - tions.\" If it was not w orth while becoming a murderer, a traitor, and an eternally damned soul, why bother about it? was his attitude. The Head of the Fraternity being threatened with revolt, X. when to him, in circumstances which jeopardised his own progress, and offered his support \"to the last drop of my blood, and the last penny of my purse.\" Deciding to perform a critical Magical Operation, and being warned that serious opposition might come from his own friends, family, etc., he abandoned his career, changed his name, cu t himself off completely from the past, and allowed no alien interest of any sort to interfere with"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 229 his absorption in the Work. His journey to see the Head seemed at that time a fatal interruption; at the least, it involved the waste of one whole year. H e was wrong; his gesture of setting the interests of the Order before his personal advancement was counted unto him for right - eousness. 6 There should be no need to extend this list; it could be continued indefinitely. X. had one rule of life, a nd one only; to do whatever came first on the list of agenda, and never to count the cost. Because this course of conduct was so rigidly rational, it appeared to others irrational and incalculable; because it was so serenely simple, it appeared an insolub le mystery of a complexity utterly unfathomable! But --- I fear that you are only too likely to ask --- is not this system (a) absurd, (b) wrong, as certain in the long run to defeat its own object. Well, as to (a), everything is absurd. The Universe is not constructed to gratify the mania of \"social planners\" and their tedipus kind. As to (b), there you said something; the refutation will lead us to open a new chapter. Ought not X. to have laid down a comprehensive scheme, and worked out the details, so that he would not break down half - way through for lack of foresight and provision for emergencies? An example. Suppose that the next step in his Work involved the sacri - fice of a camel in a house in Tooting Bec, furnished in such fashion as his Grimo ire laid down, and that the purchase of the house left him with -"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 230 out resources to but that furniture, to say nothing of the camel. What a fool! No, that does not necessarily follow. If the Gods will the End, They also will the means. I shall do all tha t is possible to me by buying the house: I shall leave it to Them to do Their share when the time comes. This \"Act of Truth\" is already a Magical Formula of infallible puissance; the man who is capable of so thinking and acting is far more likely to get w hat he wanted from the Sacrifice --- when at long last the Camel appears on the premises --- then he who, having ample means to carry out the whole Operation without risk of failure, goes through the ceremony without ever having experienced a moment's anxi ety about his ability to bring it to a successful conclusion.

The injunction is \"to buy the egg of a perfectly black hen without haggling.\" You have no means of judging what is written in Their led ger; so \"...reason is a lie;...\", ...\" & all their words are skew - wise....\" AL II, 32. Let me add that it is a well - attested fact of magical experience --- beginning with Tarquin and the Sibylline books! --- as well as a fact of profane psychology, that if you funk a fence, it is harder next time. If the boy falls off the pony, put him on again at once: if the young airman crashes, send him up again without a minute's avoidable delay. If you don't, their nerve is liable to break for good and all.

There is some danger here; for the question is a booby trap for the noble, the generous, the high - minded. \"Selfishness,\" the great characteristic of the Master of the Temple, the very quintessence of his attainment, is not its contradictory, or even its contrary; it is perfectly compatible (nay, shall we say friendly?) with it.

No! but the highest are of us. They shall rejoice, our chosen: who sorroweth is not of us. \"Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious languor, force and fire, are of us. \"We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit: let them die in their misery. For they feel not. Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp 8 down the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong: this is our law and the joy of the world. ...\" That sets up a standard, with a vengeance! (Note \"they feel not,\" twice repeated. There should be something impor - tant to the thesis herein concealed.) "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 233 The passage becomes exalted, but a verse later resumes the theme, setting forth the philosophical basis of these a pparently violent and arrogant remarks. \"...It is a lie, this folly against self....\" (AL II, 22) This is the central doctrine of Thelema in this matter. What are we to understand by it? That this imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness --- democracy some call it --- is utterly false and vile. Let us look into the matter. (First consult AL II, 24, 25, 48, 49, 58, 59. and III, 18, 58, 59. It might be confusing to quote these texts in full; but they throw much further light on the subject.)

Of we go! What really is it? The word comes from Mos, Latin for custom, manner. Similarly, ethics: from Greek ES OC custom. \"It isn't done\" may be modern slang, but it's correct. Interesting to study the usage of \"moeurs\" and \"maniÅ res\" in French. \"Manner\" from \"manus\" --- hand: it is \"the way to handle things.\" But the theological conception has steered a very w rong course, even for theology; brought in Divine Injunction, and Conscience, and a whole host of bogeys.

But what you want t o know is the difference between (a) common or area morality, (b) Yogin -- or \"holy man's\" morality, and (c) the Magical Morality of the New Aeon of Thelema. 1. Area Morality: This is the code of the \"Slave - Gods,\" very thor - ougly analysed, pulverized, a nd de - loused by Nietzsche in Antichrist. It consists of all the meanest vices, especially envy, cowardice, cruelty and greed: all based on over - mastering Fear. Fear of the nightmare type. With this incubus, the rich and powerful have devised an engine to keep down the poor and the weak. They are lavish alike with threats and promises in Ogre Bogey's Castle and Cloud - Cuckoo - Land. \"Religion is the opium of the people,\" when they flinch no longer from the phantom knout. 2. Eight Lectures on Yoga gives a re asonable account of the essence of this matter, especially in the talks on Yama and Niyama. (A book on this subject might well include a few quotations, notably from paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 in the former). It might be summarized as \"doing that, and only t hat, which facilitates the task in hand.\" A line of conduct becomes a custom when experience has shown that to follow it makes for success. \"Don't press!\" \"Play with a straight"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 235 bat!\" \"Don't draw to five!\" do not involve abstract considerations 1 of right and wrong. Orthodox Hinduism has raped this pure system, and begotten a bastard code which reeks of religion. A political manoeuvre of the Brahmin caste. Suppose we relax a little, come down to earth, and look at what the far - famed morality of the Holy Man was, and is, in actual practice. You will find this useful to crush Toshophist and Antroposophagist1 cockroaches as well as the ordinary Christian Scolex when they assail you. In the lands of Hinduism and (to a less extent) of Islam, the S ultan, the Dewan, the Maharajah, the Emir, or whatsoever they call \"the Grand Pandjandrum Himself, with the little round button on top,\" it is almost a 100 per cent rule that the button works loose and is lost! Even in less exalted circles, any absolute r uler, on however petty a scale, is liable to go the whole hog in an unexceptionably hoggish fashion. He has none to gainsay him, and he sees no reason for controlling himself. This suits nearly everybody pretty well; the shrewd Wazir can govern while his \"master\" fills up on \"The King's Peg\" (we must try one when champagne is once again reasonably cheap) and all the other sensuous and sensual delights unstinted. The result is that by the time he is twenty --- he was probably married at 12 --- he is no lon ger fitted to carry out his very first duty to the State, the production of an heir. Quite contrary to this is the career of the \"Holy Man.\" Accustomed to"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 236 the severest physical toil, inured to all the rigours of climate, aloof from every noxious excess, he becomes a very champion of virility. (Of course, there are exceptions, but the average \"holy man\" is a fairly tall fellow of his hands). More, he has been particularly trained for this form of asceticism by all sorts of secret methods and practices; so me of these, but the way, I was able to learn myself, and found surprisingly efficacious. So we have the law of supply and demand at work as uncomplainingly as usual: the Holy Man prays for the threatened Dynasty, blesses the Barren Queen; and they all li ve happy ever after. This is not an Arabian Night's Tale of Antiquity; it is the same today: there are very few Englishmen who have spent any time in India who have not been approached with proposals of this character. Similar conditions, curiously enou gh, existed in France; the \"fils ... papa\" was usually a hopeless rotter, and his wife often resorted to a famous monastery on the Riviera, where was an exceptionally holy Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary, prayers unto whom removed sterility. But when M. Co mbes turned out the monks, the Image somehow lost it virtue. Now get your Bible and turn up Luke VIII, 2! When the sal volatile has worked, turn to John XIII 2,3 and ask a scholar what any Greek of the period would have understood by the technical expres sions there unambigu - ously employed. 1^ WEH NOTE: This is a reference to the school of thought of Rudolf Steiner. By the time of this writing, Steiner's students were being taught that Crowley was a \"bad man\". Tit for tat. Anthroposophy presents a mer ging of several branches of mysticism with dance and movement. It rewards study, but one shouldn't mention A.C. at the Steiner schools until one has acquired what one wants!

Please let me emphasize the fact that I have heard and seen these condi - tions in Eastern countries with my own ears and eyes. Vivekananda --- certainly the best of the modern Indian writes on Yoga --- complained bitterly that the old greymalkin witches of New York who called them - selves his disciples had to be dodged with infinite precaution whenever he wanted to spen d an evening in the Tenderloin. On the other hand, the Sheikh of Mish --- and a very holy Sheikh he was --- introduced his \"boy friend\" as such to me when I visited him in the Sahara, without the slightest shame or embarrassment. Believe me, the humbug a bout \"morality\" in this country and the U.S.A., yes, even on the Continent in pious circles, is Hobgoblin No. 1 on the path of the Wise. If you are fooled by that, you will never get out of the stinking bog of platitudinous mouthings of make - believe \"Mast ers.\" Need I refer to the fact that most of the unco' guid are penny plain hypocrites. A little less vile are those whose prejudices are Freudian in character, who \"compound for sins that they're inclined to, By damn - ing those they have no mind to.\" Eve n when, poor - spirited molluscs, they are honest, all that twaddle is Negation. \"Hang your clothes on a hickory limb, and don't go near the water!\" does not produce a Gertrud Ederle.

Perhaps we have now relaxed enough; we see that the \"Holy man\" is not such a fool as he looks; and we may get on with our excursions into the \"Morality\" of the Law of the New Aeon, which is the Aeon of Horus, crowned and conqueri ng child: and --- \"The word of the Law is Thelema{this word in Greek caps}.\" 3. So much of The Book of the Law deals directly or indirectly with morals that to quote relevant passages would be merely bewildering. Not that this state of mind fails to resul t from the first, second, third and ninety - third perusals! \"When Duty bellows loud 'Thou must!' The youth replies 'Pike's Peak or Bust!'\" is all very well, or might be if the bellow gave further particulars. And one's general impre ssion may very well be that Thelema not only gives general licence to to any fool thing that comes into one's head, but urges in the most emphatic terms, reinforced by the most eloquent appeals in superb language, by glowing promises, and by categorical as surance that no harm can possibly come thereby, the performance of just that specific type of action, the maintenance of just that line of conduct, which is most severely depreciated by the high priests and jurists of every religion, every system of ethics , that ever was under the sun! You may look sourly down a meanly - pointed nose, or yell \"Whoop La!\" and make for Piccadilly Circus: in either case you will be wrong; you will not have understood the Book. Shameful confession, one of my own Chelas (or so i t is rather incredibly "},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 239 3 reported to me) said recently: \"Self - discipline is a form of Restric - tion.\" (That, you remember, is \"The word of Sin ...\".) Of all the utter rubbish! (Anyhow, he was a \"centre of pestilence\" for discussing the Book at all.) About 90 % of Thelema, at a guess, is nothing but self - discipline. One is only allowed to do anything and everything so as to have more scope for exercising that virtue. concentrate on \"...thou hast no right but to do thy will.\" The point is that any possible act is to be performed if it is a necessary factor in that Equation of your Will. Any act that is not such a factor, however harmless, noble, virtuous or what not, is at the best a waste of energy. But there are no artificial barriers on an y type of act in general. The standard of conduct has one single touchstone. There may be --- there will be --- every kind of difficulty in determining whether, by this standard, any given act is \"right\" or \"wrong\": but there should be no confusion. No act is righteous in itself, but only in reference to the True Will of the person who proposes to perform it. This is the Doctrine of Relativity applied to the moral sphere. I think that, if you have understood this, the whole theory is now within your gr asp; hold it fast, and lay about you! Of course, there must be certain courses of action which, generally speaking, will be right for pretty well everybody. Some, per contra, will be generally barred, as interfering with another's equal right. Some cases will be so difficult that only a Magister Templi can judge them, and a Magus carry them wisely into effect.

The O.T.O. is a training of the Masonic type; there is no \"astral\" work in it at all, nor any Yoga. Ther e is a certain amount of Qabalah, and that of great doctrinal value.

Education means \"leading out\"; this is not the same as \"stuffing in\". "},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 248 I refuse to enlarge on this theme; it is all - important. To extract something, you should first know what is there. Here astrology ought to give useful hints; its indications give the mind somet hing to work on. Experience makes \"confirmation strong as Holy Writ;\" but beware of ... priori. Do not be dogmatic; do not insist in the face of dis - appointment. Astrology in education is useful as geology is to the prospector; it tells you the sort of t hing to look for, and the direction in which to explore. There are, however, two main lines of teaching which are of universal value to normal children; it is hardly possible to begin too early. Firstly, accustom his ear from the start to noble sounds; t he music of nature and the rhythm of great poetry. Do not aim at his understand - ing, but at his subconscious mind. Protect him from cacophonous noise; avoid scoring any cheap success with him by inflicting jingles; do not insult him by \"baby - talk.\" Sec ondly, let him understand, as soon as you start actual teaching, the difference between the real and the conventional in what you make him memorize. Nothing irritates children more than the arbitrary \"because I say so.\" Nobody knows why the alphabet has the order which we know; it is quite senseless. One could construct a much more rational order: e.g. the Mother, the Single and the Double letters, all in the natural order of the elements, planets and signs. Again, we have the \"Missionary\" Alpha - bet, a rranged \"scientifically\" as Gutturals, modified ditto, Dentals, Labials, vowels and so on; a most repulsive concoction! But I would not accept any emendation from the God Thoth himself; it is infinitely simpler to stick to the familiar order. But explain to the child that this is only for convenience, like the rule of the road; indeed, like"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 249 almost any rules! But when your teaching is of the disputable kind, explain that too; encourage him to question, to demand a reason and to disagree. Get him to fence with you; sharpen his wits by dialectic; lure him into think - ing for himself. I want tricks which will show him the advantages of a given subject of study; make him pester you to teach him. We did this most successfully at the Abbey of Thelema in Cefal u; let me give you an instance: reading. One of us would take the children shopping and bring up the subject of ice - cream. Where, oh where could we get some? Presently one would exclaim and point to a placard and say, \"I really do believe there'll be so me there\" --- and lo! it was so. Then they 9 would wonder how one knew, and one would say: Why, there's \"Helados\" printed on that piece of card in the window. They would want to learn to read at once. We would discourage them, saying what hard w ord it was, and how much crying it cost, at the same time giving another demon - stration of the advantages. They would insist, and we should yield --- to active, eager children, not to dullards that hated the idea of \"lessons.\" So with pretty well everyt hing; we first excited the child's will in the desired direction. But (you ask) are there any special branches of learning which you regard as essential for all? Yes. Our old unvalued friend St. Paul, the cunning crook who turned the"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 250 Jewish communism of the Apostles into an international ramp, saw in a vision a man from Macedonia who said \"Come over and help us!\" This time it has been a woman from California, but the purport of her plaints was identical. Much as I should like to see my Father the Sun o nce more before I die, nothing doing until --- if ever --- life recovers from the blight of regulations. Luckily, one thing she said helps us out: some - one had told her that I had written on Education in Liber Aleph --- The Book of Wisdom or Folly --- wh ich has been ready for the printer for more than a quarter of a century --- and there's nothing I can do about it! However, I looked up the typescript. The book is itself Education; there are, however, six chapters which treat of the subject in the Speci al sense in which your question has involved us.

And it is this, that since that wh ich can be thought is not true, every Statement is in some sense false. Even on the Sea of Pure Reason, we may say that every 10 Statement is in some Sense disputable.

And this Prac - tice will develop its Power of Thought, and its Confidence in itself, and its Interest in all Knowledge. But most of all beware against any Attempt to bias its Mind on any Point that lieth with - out the Square of ascertained and undisputed Fact. Remember also, even when thou art most sure, that so were they sure who gave Instruction to the young Copernicus.

Yet there remaineth Causality, which is the Root of the Actions a nd Reactions of Nature. This also shalt thou seek ardently, that thou mayest comprehend the Variety of the Universe, its Harmony and its Beauty, with the Knowledge of that which compelleth it. Yet this is not equal to the former two i n Power to reveal thee to thyself; and its first Use is to instruct thee in the true Method of Advancement in Knowledge, which is, fundamentally, the observation of the Like and Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee the Ecstasy of Wond er; and it shall bring thee to a proper Understanding of Art Magick. For our Magick is but one of the Powers that lie within us undeveloped and unanalysed; and it is by the Method of Science that it must be made clear, and available to the Use of Man. Is not this a Gift beyond Price, the Fruit of a Tree not only of Knowledge but of Life? For there is that in Man which is God, and there is that also which is Dust; and by our Magick we shall make these twain one Flesh, to the Ob - taining of the Empery of the Universe. I suppose I might have put it more concisely: Classics is itself Initiation, being the key of the Unconscious; Mathematics is the Art of manipulating the Ruach, and of raising it to Neschamah; and Scie nce is co - terminous with Magick.

His illiteracy had disqualified him when he applied for the job after landing. The story is not only true, but \"of all Truth;\" see my previous letter on \"Certainty. Books are not the only medium even of learning; more, what they teach is partial, prejudiced, meagre, sterile, uncertain, and alien to reality. It follows that all the best books are those which make no pretence to accuracy: poetry, theatre, fiction. All others date. Another point is that Truth abides abov e and aloof from intellectual expression, and consequently those books which bear the Magic Keys of the Portal of the Intelligible by dint of inspiration and suggestion come more nearly to grips with Reality than those whose appeal is only to the Intellect . \"Didactic\" poetry, \"realistic\" plays and novels, are contradictions in terms.

Short of the ideals above outlined, you may as well have a pis aller --- words of astonishing insight and wisdom, not alien to the Law Thelema, and written by one who was trained on The Book of the Law. \"Self - confidence must be cultivated in the younger members of the nation from childhood onwards. Their whole education and training must be directed towards giving them a conviction that they are superior to others\", wrote Hitler. \"In the case of female education,\" I read on, \"the main stress should be laid on bodily training, after that on character, and, last of all, on the intellect; but the one absolute aim of female education must be with a view to the fut ure mother.\" They are quoted as an extreme example of all that is horrible and evil by Mr. George E.

There is a game, an improvement on the \"Spelling Bee\" --- I have anti - christened it \"Fore a nd aft\" so as to be natty and naval --- which is in my opinion one of the three or four best indoor games for two ever invented., Here are the rules, in brief: any disputed points? Apply to me. 1. A \"Word\" consists of four or more letters. 2. It must be printed in big black type in the Dictionary chosen for reference. (Nuttall's is fairly good, though some very well - known words are omitted. The Oxford Pocket Dictionary is useless; it is for morons, illiterates, wallowers in \"Basic English\" --- and [I suppose] Oxonians. No proper names, however well - known, unless used as common: e.g. Bobby, a flatfoot, a beetlecrusher, a harness bull; or Xantippe, a shrew, a lady. X - rays is given in the plural only: ditto \"Rântgen - rays\", and they give \"Rântgenogram\" . \"You never can tell!\" Participles, plurals and the like are not \"words\" unless printed as such in big black type. E.g. Nuttall's \"Juttingly\" is a word; \"jutting\" is not, being in smaller type. \"Soaking\" is in small type, but also in big type as a nou n; so it is a word.) 3. The Dictionary is the sole and final arbiter. This produces blas - phemy, but averts assassination. 4. The first player starts with the letter A. The second may put any letter he chooses either before or after that A. The othe r continues as he will, and can. 5. The player who cannot add a letter without completing a \"word\" loses. They proceed to B, and so on to Z. "},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 259 14 6. A player whose turn it is must either add his letter within a reasonable (This is a matter of go od feeling, courtesy and considera - tion) time, may say \"I challenge\" or, alternatively, \"That is a 'word'.\" The other must then give the \"word\" that he intends, or deny that it is a \"word\" within the meaning of the Art, as the case may be. The Dictionary decides the winner. The challenged player may give one word only, and that in the form which is printed in the Dictionary; e.g. if he were challenged at BRUSS, and answered Brussels, he would lose; if BRUSSELS - SPROUTS, he would win. Hyphens need not be given. CASHMERE is a \"word\"; it is a kind of shawl, etc., so is CHARLEY, a night - watchman. Don't argue: the Dictionary decides. 7. This game calls not only for an extensive vocabulary but for courage; foresight, judgment, resource, subtlety and even low cunning. It can be played by more than two players, but the more there are, the more the element of chance comes in; and this is hateful to really fine players and diminishes the excitement. The rapier - play of two experts, when a word changes from one l ine of formation to another, and then again, perhaps even a third time, is as exhilarating as a baseball - game or a bull - fight.

And per contra, I doubt if there is any class which is not detestable to some other class. Artists, police, the clerg y, \"reds,\" foxhunters, Freemasons, Jews, \"heaven - born,\" women's clubwomen (especially in U.S.A.), \"Methodys,\" golfers, dog - lovers; you can't find one body without its \"natural\" enemies. It's right, what's worse; every class, as a class, is almost sure to have more defects than qualities. As soon as you put men together, they somehow sink, corporatively, below the level of the worst of the individuals composing it. Collect scholars on a club committee, or men of science on a jury; all their virtues vanish , and their vices pop out, rein - forced by the self - confidence which the power of numbers is bound to bestow. It is peculiarly noticeable that when a class is a ruling minority, it acquires a detestation as well as a contempt for the surrounding \"mob.\" In the Northern States of U.S.A., where the whites are overwhelming in number, the \"nigger\" can be more or less a \"regular fellow;\" in the South, where fear is a factor, Lynch Law prevails. (Should it? The reason for \"NO\" is that it is a confession of weak ness.) But in the North, there is a very strong feeling about certain other classes: the Irish, the Italians, the Jews. Why? Fear again; the Irish in poli - tics, the Italians in crime, the Jews in finance. But none of these phobias prevent friendship b etween individuals of hostile classes. I think that perhaps I have already written enough --- at least enough to start you thinking on the right lines. And mark well this! The submergence of the individual in his class means the end of all true human re lations between men. Socialism means war. When the class moves as a class, there can be no exceptions.

They picked individuals to rule under their autocracy, killed off those that wouldn't fit, destroyed the power of the Trades Unions or Soviets while pretending to make them powerful and prosperous, and settled down to the seri ous business of preparing for the war which both knew to be inevitable. It is this fundamental fact which ensures that every democracy shall end with an upstart autocrat; the stability of peace depends upon the original idea which aggrandized America in a century from four millions to a hundred: extreme individualism with opportunity.

How right politicians are to look upon their constituents as cattle!

And so, whenever we find one Man who has no fear like Ibsen's Doctor Stockmann or Mark Twain's Colonel Grainger that strolled out on his balcony with his shotgun to face the mob that had come to lynch him, he can get away with it. \"An Enemy of the People\" wrote Ibsen, \"Ye are against the people, O my chosen!\" says The Book of the Law.

A banker in New York once told me that the dollar circulated nine times as fast as the English equivalent, so that people seemed to themselves to be nine times as rich. (I told you about the Å100 note in a special letter on Money). But here I am stressing the spiritual effect; what happens is that anxiety vanishes; one feel that as it goes out, so it comes in. This view is not inco mpatible with thrift and prudence, and all that lot of virtues, far from it, it tucks in with them quite easily. You must practise this; there's a knack in it. Success in this leads to a very curious result indeed; not only does the refusal to count (Fou rpen'north or Yoga, please miss, and Mum says can I have a penny if I bring back the bottle!), bring about the needlessness of counting, but also one acquires the power to command!

It meant that the facts were so undeniable that the \"advertisement for Answer to Prayer\" outweighed the \"miracle by a heretic.\" I knew a poetess of great distinction who used to amuse herself by breaking off a conversation and saying, \"Give me a franc\" (or a shilling, or any small sum) and then going on with her previous remarks.

Cups: we are much more definite again. The great test is so well known, and accounts have already been published, that it can be here plainly stated. Early in his career, t he Aspirant is exposed to the seductions of a Vampire, and warned in due form and due season. \"Sleep with A,B,C,D,E and F, my lad, and our hearty best wishes! But not with G on any account, on peril of your work!\" So off he goes to G, without a second's hesitation. This test may be prolonged; the deadliness and subtlety of the danger has been recog - nized, and he may have half a dozen warnings, either direct or springing from his relations with her. And the penalty is not so drastically final; often he gets off with a term of penal servitude.

In the \"To - day and to - morrow\" series is an essay called Ouroboros, by Garet Garrett; one of the most shrewd and deep - delving analysis of economics ever written. May I condense him crud ely? Mass Production for profit fails when its markets are exhausted; so every effort is made to impose it not only on the native but the foreigner, and should guile fail, then force! But the process ineluctably goes on; when the whole world buys the nas ty stuff, and will accept no other, the exploiter is still faced by diminishing returns. No possibility of expansion; sooner or later dividends dwindle, and the Business is Bust. To even the most stupid it becomes plain at this stage that war is wholly r uinous; organization breaks down altogether; one meaningless revolution follows another; famine and pestilence complete the job. Last time --- when Osiris replaced Isis --- the wreck was limited in scope --- note that it was the civilized, the organized p art that broke down. (Jews and Arabs could remain aloof, and keep a small torch burning until Light returned with the Renaissance.) This time there is no civilization which can escape being involved in the totality of the catastrophe. Towards this colla pse all totalitarian movements inevitably tend.

If there is one barber for ten thousand men, most of them will remai n unshorn; if there are five thousand barbers, most of them will be out of a job.

Ad infinitum, like the fleas in the epig ram! When laws are reasonable in the eyes of the average man, he respects them, keeps them, does his best to maintain them; therefore a minute Police Force, with powers strictly limited, is adequate to deal with the almost negligibly small criminal class. A convention is laudable when it is convenient. When laws are unjust, monstrous, ridiculous, that same average man, will he - nill he, becomes a criminal; and the law requires a Tcheka or a Gestapo with dictatorial powers and no safeguards to maintain the farce. Also, corruption becomes normal in official circles; and is excused. I refer you to Mr. J. H.

No. It was needful to indicate this cumulative progression to social shipwreck,because, to - day an obvious peril of the most menacing, in 1904 no ordinary sane person foresaw anything of the s ort. But special knowledge alters things, and it is certain that the Masters anticipated, with great exactness of calculation, the way things would go in the political world. Practically all the messages received during the \"Cairo Working\" (March - April 1904 e.v.) came to me through Ouarda.

Putting two and two together, and making 718, it looks as if the Masters acquiesced in and helped to fulfill, the formula of the catastrophi c succession of the Aeons. An analogy. We have the secret of the Elixir of Life, and could carry on in the same body indefinitely; yet at least some masters prefer to reincarnate in the regular way, only taking care to waste no time in Amennti, but to ge t back to the Old Bench and pick up the New Tools with the minimum of delay.

THE GODS: HOW AND WHY THEY OVERLAP Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Your last letter. I am glad: it shows you have been putting in some genuine original work. Result! You make a very shrewd observation; you have noticed the curious fashion in which Gods seem to overlap. It is not the same (you point out) with Angels. In no other system do we find a parallel for the Living Creatures. Wheels, Wings, Fie ry Serpents, with such quasi - human cohorts as the Beni Elohim who beget the children on women, to whom the Qabalah has introduced us. The Beni Elohim is actually an exception; there is the Incubus and some of the Fairy Folk, as well as certain Gods and de mi - Gods, who act thus paternally. But you are right in the main. The Arabs, for example, have \"seven heavens\" and seven Orders of Angels, also Jinn; but the classes are by no means identical. This, even though certain Archangels, notably Gabriel, appear in both systems. But then Gabriel is a definite individual, a person --- and this fact is the key to your puzzle. For, as I have explained in a previous letter, Gods are people: macro - cosms, not mere collocations of the elements, planets and signs as a re most of the angels, intelligences and spirits. It is interesting to note that Gabriel in particular seems to be more than one of these; he enjoys the divine privilege of being himself. Between you and me and the pylon, I suspect that Gabriel who gave t he Q'uran to Mohammed was in reality a \"Master\" or messenger of some such person, more or less as Aiwass describes himself as \"...the minister of Hoor - paar -"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 288 kraat.\" (AL I, 7) His name implies some such function; for G.B.R. is Mercury between the Two Grea ter Lights, Sol and Luna. This seems to mean that he is something more than a lunar or terrestrial arch - angel; as he would appear to be from 777. (There now! That was my private fiend again --- the Demon of Digression. Back to our Gods!) 30 7 77 itself, to say nothing of The Golden Bough and the Good Lord knows how many other similar monuments of lexicography (for really they are little more), is our text - book. We are bound to note at once that the Gods sympathise, run into one another, coales ce much more closely than any other of the Orders of Being. There is not really much in common between a jackal and a beetle, or between a wolf and an owl, although they are grouped under Pisces or Aries respectively. But Adonis, Attis, Osiris, Melcarth, Mithras, Marsyas --- --- --- a whole string of them comes tripping off the tongue. They all have histories; their birth, their life, their death, their subsequent career; all goes naturally with them exactly as if they were (say) a set of warriors, paint ers, anything superbly human. We feel instinc - tively that we know them, or at least know of them in the same sense that we know of our fellow men and women; and that is a sense which never so much as occurs to us when we discuss Archangels. The great ex ception is the Holy Guardian Angel; and this as I have shewn in another letter is for exactly the same reason; He is a Person, a macrocosmic Individual. (We do not know about his birth and so on;"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 289 but that is because he is, so to speak, a private God; he o nly appears to the world at all through some reference to him by his client; for instance, the genius or Augoeides of Socrates). Let us see how this works in practice. Consider Zeus, Jupiter, Amon - Ra, Indra, etc., we can think of them as the same identi cal people known and described by Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and Hindus; they differ as Mont Cervin differs from Monte Silvio and the Matterhorn. (They are bound to appear different, because the mountain does not look the same from Zermatt as it does from D omodossola, or even as seen by a French - Swiss and a German - Swiss.) In the same way read the Life of Napoleon written by one of his marshals, by Michelet (a rabid Republi - can), by Lord Rosebery, by a patriotic Russian, and by a German poet and philosopher : one can hardly believe that the subject of any two of these biographies is the same man. But upon certain points the identity is bound to transpire; even when we read of his crushing and classic defeat at Waterloo by the Belgians, the man is detected. Transferring the analogy to the Gods, it is then open to us to suppose that Tahuti, Thoth, Hermes, Mercury, Loki, Hanuman and the rest are identical, and that the diversity of the name and the series of exploits is due merely to the accidents of time and s pace. But it is at least equally plausible to suggest that these Gods are different individuals, although of the identical Order of Being, characteristics and function. Very much as if one took Drake, Frobisher, Raleigh, Hood, Blake, Rodney and Nelson, as seen through the mists of history, tradition, legend and plain mythopoeia.

History lends its weight to my view. When the philosophic schools, unable to refute the charge of absurdity leveled at the orth odox devotee who believed that Mars actually begot Romulus and Remus on a Vestal Virgin, explained that Mars was no more than the martial instinct, and the Virgin a type of Purity, their faith declined, and with it Roman Virtue. \"Educate\" Colonel Blimp's children and we have the \"intelligentsia\" of Bloomsbury. I am very sorry about all this; but life must always be brutal and stupid so long as it depends upon 31 animals and vegetables for nourishment. How restore faith in the Gods? There is only one way; we must get to know them personally. And that, of course, is one of the principal tasks of the Magician. One further remark. I have suggested that all these \"identical\" gods are in reality distinct persons, but belonging to the same families. Can we follow up this line of thought? Yes: but I will defer it to a subsequent letter.  Love is the law, love under will.  Yours fraternally,  666 CHAPTER LXXXVII  WORK WORTH WHILE: WHY?

What follows is a rough outline of my argument. I began by pointing out that Nature exercises many forms of Energy, which are not directly observable by the senses. In fact, the History of Science for the last hundred and fifty years or so has consisted principally of the discovery of such types, with their analysis, measure - ment and manipulation.

At this point I want especially to call your attention to c ertain species of animals (bees and termites are obvious cases) where a collective consciousness seems to exist, since the community acts as a whole in evidently purposeful ways, yet the units of that community are not even complete in themselves. (Isn't there some series of worms, each sub - type able only to subsist on the excrement of its preserver in the series?)

In all such cases the operative consciousness does not reside in any single person, as one might argue that it did when an orator \"carries away\" his audience. But these remarks have rather shunted one into a siding away from the main line of argument. My most important point is to insist that even with the most familiar forms of energy, man has done no creative work so ever. He has discovered, examined, measured (rather clumsily) and used, but in no case has he understood, still less explained, the causes of phenomena. Sometimes he cannot even reconcile different \"laws of Nature.\" So we find J.W.N. Sullivan exclai ming \"The scientific adventure may yet have to be abandoned,\" and to me personally he confessed \"It may yet turn out that the mathe - matical approach to Reality may have to be supplanted by the Magical.\" Now in Nature it leaps at one that Will and Intelli gence are behind phenomena. My old friend and colleague Professor Buckmaster, who wrote a book on \"Blood\" which, he admitted, could not possibly be understood by more than six people, told me that the ingenuity of the structure of the human kidney \"almost frightened\" him. Yet in all Nature there is no trace whatever of any purpose such as human mentality can grasp. Again, apparent purpose often appears to be baffled. Take one example. Evolution, working through thousands of years to estab - lish a most subtle scheme of cross - fertilization, found, just as it was perfect, conditions so altered that it was completely useless. The \"law of cause and effect\" itself took a death - blow when Hesinger showed that the old formula \"If A then B\" was invalid, and must be altered to \"If A, then B or C or D or E or . . . \" But at least we know enough phenomena to make it certain that Will and"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 294 33 Intelligence do exist somehow apart from any nervous and cerebral system of which we are aware, and that these must be of a type which transcends our human consciousness as that does that of a limpet or a lichen. It follows that somehow, somewhere, there must be \"gods\" or \"Masters\" --- whatever name you like. And that, I suppose, is what you may call the premise major o f my syllogism. The minor, I confess, is not so apodeictic. No one, I suppose, is going to point proudly to the present state of human affairs, as evi - dence that we are all becoming wiser and nobler every minute, as people did seventy years ago.

Well, if we have to wait for the calamity, and for evolution to begin all over again in a number of centuries --- with luck! --- one thing is at least quite certain: we can do nothing about it.

Well, consider the cause of the impending collapse. It is quite simple: Knowledge is loose, without control o f Will and of Intelligence. (How clearly the Qabalah states and demonstrates this doctrine! But I musn't be naughty; let me stick to Common Sense!) Now, these qualities in us having failed to measure up to the situation of the world, one hope remains; t o get into communication with those \"gods\" or \"masters\" whose existence was demonstrated in my Premise Major and learn from Them. But is this possible? Tradition and experience unite to assert that it is so; moreover, various forms of technique for accom plishing this are at our disposal. This is what is called The Great Work; and it is abundantly clear that no other aim is worth pursuit. So much for the argument; it will be agreed readily enough that to put it into practice we shall need an Alphabet, a Grammar and a Diction - ary.

Oh, quite right, quite, quite right of you to remind me. \"Definition first!\" A \"sore spot\" is one which reacts abnormally and violently, however gently you touch it; more, all the other bits of you give a painful j erk, however disconnected they may seem. Still more, the entire System undergoes a spasm of apprehension; and the total result is that the mental as well as the physical system is quite unable to grasp the situation with any accuracy, and the whole man is temporarily engulphed in what is naturally not far from a condition of insanity.

I shall leave it to the psychoanalysts to demonstrate the reduction to Sex, merely r emarking that though I agree with their analysis as far as it goes, I do not allow it to stop where they do.

It is the True Will on the creative plane: \"By Wisdom formed He the worlds.\" So soon as its thau maturgy is accomplished, it is, through Binah, understood as the Logos. Thus in Sex we find every one of the primary Correspondences of Chokmah. Being thus inef - fable and sacrosanct, it is (plainly enough) peculiarly liable to profanation. Being profan ed, it is naturally more unspeakably nasty than any other of the \"Mysteries.\" You will find a good deal on this subject implied in Artemis Iota, attached to another of my letters to you. Before tackling \"Sore Spots\" seriously, there is after all, one poi nt which should be made clear as to this Trinitarian simplification. One of the most interesting and fruitful periods of my life was when 35 I was involved in research as to the meaning of Sankhara: \"tendencies\" may be, indeed is, a good enough tr anslation, but it leaves one very much as deeply in the dark as before. You remember --- I hope! --- that Sankhara lies between Vinnanam, Pure Consciousness, and Sanna, Percep - tion. For instance, an electric fan in motion: a house - fly \"tends\" to see the vanes as we do when they are still, we \"tend\" to see a diaphanous blur. Then, in delirium tremens, why do we tend to see pink rats rather than begonias or gazelles?"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 298 We tend to see the myriad flashing colours of the humming bird; the bird itself does not ; it has no apparatus of colour - sense; to him all appears a neutral tint, varying only in degrees of brightness. Such were some of the fundamental facts that directed the course of my research, whose results you may read in \"The Psychology of Hashish\", by Oliver Haddo in The Equinox, Vol. I, No. 2. The general basis of this Essay is Sankhara; it shows how very striking are the analogies between, (1) the results obtained by Mystics --- this includes the Ecstasy of Sexual Feeling, as you may read in pretty nearly all of them, from St. Augustine to St. Teresa and the Nun Gertrude. The stages recounted by the Buddha in his psychological analyses correspond with almost incredible accuracy. (2) The phenomena observed by those who use opium, hashish, and some o ther \"drugs\" (3) The phenomena of various forms of insanity. The facts of this research are infuriating to the religious mystic; and the fact of its main conclusion is liable to drive him into so delirious a frenzy of rage as to make one reach for one's n otebook --- one more typical extreme case! Now of course very few religious persons know that they are mystics --- already it annoys them to suggest it! --- but, whether the lady doth protest too much, or too little, the fact is that they are. There is n o true rational meaning in religion. consider the Athanasian Creed itself! Observe that the rationalist dare not yield a millionth of a millimetre. \"First cut the Liquefaction, what comes next But Fichte's clever cut at God himsel f? . . .

He feels the touch of the rapier, however shrewdly or cautiously wielded. The salute itself is more than enough; he feels already the thrust to his vitals. I remember sailing happily in to breakfast at Camberwell Vicarage, and saying cheerfully, in absolute good faith: \"A fine morning, Mr. Kelly!\" I was astounded at the reply. The dear old gentleman --- and he really was one of the best! --- half choked, then gobbled at me like a turkey! \"You're a very insolent young man!\" Poor, tin y Aleister!

Often enough, he does not mind gross jests which admit complicity on the part of the other; but any allusion to the Truth, and his soul shrieks: I am fo und out! Then apoplectic Fear puts on the mask of Indignation and Disgust. As for a serious discussion of anything concerned therewith, why, every word is a new rasping tear. The mind takes refuge in irrational and irrelevant outbursts of feigned rage a nd horror. In the case of religion, the consciousness of guilt extended to cover everything from \"playin' chuch - farden on the blessâd tombstones\" to \"the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.\" Against this vague and mon - strous bogey, religion is the only sa feguard, and therefore to suggest the unsoundness of the guarantee is to strike at the roots of all security. It is like hinting to some besotted and uxorious oldster, that his young wife may be unfaithful. It is the poison that Iago dripped so skillfull y into the long hairy ear of the dull Moor. So he reacts irrationally --- every bush conceals a bear --- nay, more likely a Boojum, or a Bunyip, or some other creature of fear - spurred Imagination! \"Monstrum informe, ingens, horrendum.\" Note well the \"inf orme.\" And because the guarantee is unsound (and must be, or where would be the point of \"Faith\"?) reassurance is in the nature of things impossible.

She drank to us, and clumped away downstairs. S he came out into the studio from under the gallery, braced herself and shook her mop of hair as if about to wrestle, waved to us and waited. A minute later a small trap at the far end of the studio was smartly pulled up; in rushed a hundred starving rats .

It was not so easy a victory as I have perhaps described it, once she slipped in the slime and came down with a thud; and at the end blood s purted from innumerable bites. The whole scene was too much for most of the men; they literally howled liked famished wolves, and shook the balustrade until it creaked and groaned. Presently one slipped over, let himself lightly to the floor and charged. Others followed. All had their heart's desire. I was reminded of Swinburn's Laus Veneris, \"I let mine eyes have all their will of thee I seal myself upon thee with my might.\" As for the women, the ferocious glitter of their eyes was almost terri - fying.

(wasn't he?) --- but not enough, and Industrialism, the mother and nurse of Socialism, was destroying the soul of the people. In my not very maternal remarks on Mother - love, was included the sub - stance of the one wise saying of my pet Ameri can lunatic \"You can't get past their biology.\" This is so true, and so disheartening, that it arouses me to combat. Must we for ever be bound to the inconvenient habit of sows and cabbages? I pick up the glove. Isn't it Aldous Huxley who says somewher e that some species or other can never develop higher powers because its brain is shut in by its carapace? I thought this too, long ago; and I went into interminable conferences with my old friend, Professor Buckmaster; I wanted to extend brain surgery to produce the phenomena of Yoga. Also, I wondered what would happened if we wedged apart the sections of the cranium at, or shortly after, birth, so as to prevent them closing and giving the brain a chance to grow. I suspect, by the way, that something of the sort is done in China and 43 Bruma; but the object is merely to produce megalocephalic idiots as a valuable addition to the financial resources of the family. I thought that modern physiology, with its great recent advances in knowledge of th e specialized functions of the brain, might quite possibly succeed in producing genius.

Qui vivra verra. Anyhow, all that I really want you to get into your head \"sunning over with little curls\" is that Progress demands Anarchy tempered by Common Sense, and that the most formidable obstacle is this Biology. The exp erience of the Magician and the Yogi does suggest that there is room in the human brain as at present constituted for almost limitless expansion.

In Macbeth we read ---  . . . . \"Security"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 314 Is mortals' chiefest enemy.\" but this is another kind of security; it is the Hubris which \" tempts Providence,\" the insolence of thinking that nothing can go wrong. Anyhow, there's no such thing as safety. Life is a gamble. From the moment of incarnation a million accidents are possible. Miscarriage, still - birth, abortion; throughout life, un til your heart beats for the last time, \"you never can tell\" - - - - - and then you start all over again with your next incarnation! (I wish I had a copy of a short story of mine called \"Every Precaution.\" 44 The gallant young Uplift Expert, the o ne hundred per cent red - blooded, clean - living, heir of the Eternities, takes his young fiancâe and female counterpart to the \"Old Absinthe House\" in New Orleans to show her the terrible results of Wrong - Doing.

Somehow, people got suspic ious, and sure enough, when they broke in, they found that she had pickled him! This story is founded on fact; damn it, why did the MS have to get lost?) Even suicide is not a \"dead bird.\" I knew a creature once - -- careless observers often mistook him of a man --- who tried three times, pistol, rope and poison. Something always went wrong.

Finally he did poison himself, by accident, when he had no inte ntion whatever of doing anything of the sort. \"Where's the Book of Lies? Ah, here we are. \"It is chance, and chance only, that rules the Universe; therefore, and therefore only, life is good.\" Then, is it mere fatuity and folly to make plans? Was not the IXth Atu, the Hermit, also at one time called \"Prudence?\" Of course. Abstract philosophy rarely coincides with common - sense. We should plan as carefully as we can; but we should always allow a margin for every conceivable accident. Nor should we tru st to luck, like England, when she goes to war. Bret Harte has an admirable story \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\" in which the \"bad man,\" the crooked gambler, gives his life for the safety of the rest of his party, and winds up all with the remark: \"Life isn 't in having the luck of the cards, but in playing a poor hand well.\" Yes, I daresay, all very fine; but what you wanted to know was about the propriety of taking risks in Magick. So off we go. Risks, we have agreed, are always unavoidable; but we can c alculate them. The best and wisest man I ever knew, the late Oscar Eckenstein, was once offered a job which gave him a fifty percent chance of survi - val. He calmly sat down, worked out his \"expectation of life,\" his \"expectation of income,\" and the Lord alone knows what other factors. It came out that the pay offered was a thousand pounds or so less than he might expect normally, so he turned down the offer. Not a trace of sentiment of any kind! Now let us consider an \"A.B. case.\" John Jeremiah Jenkin s sees a short"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 316 cut to his performance of the Great work. To seize this opportunity, he must give up a steady job with good prospects and as near safety as is possible in the nature of things, for a slim chance of a career in the most insecure of all the p rofessions. He can do it; that is at the mercy of his Will; but he risks something very close to the utter wreck and ruin of his future. Only a miracle 45 can bring him through. Just so! But is he not neglecting one factor in his problem? Who put this romantically insane opportunity in his way? The Gods: it must be, since he is performing the Great Work. Very well then! It is up to Them to watch: \"he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways: in their hands they sha ll bear thee up lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.\" What's more, he must leave it at that; he must not insult Them by constantly looking out for extra safeguards, or \"hedging.\" (You remember the Major in The Suicide Club when Prince Florizel was pi cking seconds for a duel? \"In all my life I never so much as hedged a bet.\") You must give Them plenty of opportunity to show Their approval by steering you miraculously through one crisis after another. This course of conduct may seem to you a little l ike the \"Act of Truth\" but this is only superficially the case. The latter is usually an emergency measure, and either not particularly serious or as serious as anything can be. But what I have said above amounts really to a regular Rule of Life.

In your well - worn copy of the Bagh - i - muattar you have no doub t triply underlined that great verse: \"Who hath the How is careless of the Why,\" which shows how cunning I was to induce you to put all your \"why\" questions first. But now let us get down to orichalc taques, as the Norman peasant might say. The first and absolutely essential task for the Aspirant is to write his Magical Record. You know some elementary Mechanics --- the Triangle of Forces, and all that. Well, if we have a body acted on by two equal forces, one pulling it East, the other sou th, it will tend to move in a south - Easterly direction. But if the \"south\" force is (say) twice as strong, it will move south of South - East. Now you, sitting in your study reading this letter, got there and were 46 "},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 318 compelled to do that, as the re sult of the impact upon you of countless quintillions of forces of every kind. I don't expect you to discover all these and calculate and report them; but I want you to set down all the main currents. For so you should be able to get some sort of answer to the question \"Where do we go from here, boys?\" I am not a guesser; and I cannot judge you, or advise you, or help you, unless and until I know the facts as thoroughly as you are able to allow me to do. The construction of this Record is, incidentally, the first step in the practice called Sammasati, and leads to the acquisition of the Magical Memory --- the memory of your previous incarnations. So there is another reason, terrifically cogent, for writing this Magical Record as clearly and as fully as you can. This best explanation of how to set about the task is given in Liber Thisharb. some of this sounds rather advanced and technical; but it ought to give you the general idea. You should begin with your parents and the family traditions; the circu mstances of your birth and education; your social position; your financial situation; your physique, health, illnesses; your vita sexualis; your hobbies and amusements; what you are good at, what not; how you came to be interested in the Great Work; what ( if you have been on false trails, Toshophists, Antroposophagists, sham Rosicrucians, etc.) has been \"your previous condition of servitude;\" how you found me, and decided to enlist my aid. That, by itself, helps you to understand yourself, and me to unders tand you. From that point the keeping of the Record is quite easy. All you have to do is to put down what practices you mean to begin, how you get on"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 319 with them from day to day, and (at intervals) what I have to say about your progress. Remember always t hat we have no use for piety, for vague chatter, for guesswork; we are as strictly scientific as biologists or chemists. We ban emotion from the start; we demand perception; and (as you will see later on) even perception is not acceptable until we have mad e sure of its bases by a study of what we call the \"tendencies.\" That is all about the Magical Record; the way is now clear to set forth our Method. This is two - fold. (1) Yoga, introversion, (2) Magick, extroversion. (These are rough but useful connota tions.) The two seem, at first glance, to be opposed; but, when you have advanced a little in both, you find that the concentration learnt in Yoga is of immense use in attaining the mental powers necessary in magick; on the other hand, the discipline of Magick is of the greatest service in Yoga. Let me remark, by the way, that to my mind one of the greatest beauties, and most encouraging confirmations of the validity of our system, is the matchless harmony of its elements. Always, when we pursue any one path to its end, we find that it has become one with some other path which at the outset appeared utterly irreconcilable with it. 47 (\"Write down that the tearing apart is the crushing together\" comes from an actual experience. See Liber 418, Th e Vision and the Voice, which teems with similar passages, and is itself an outstanding example of the unity of the Yogic and the Magical methods.) "},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 320 To study Yoga, you have my Book 4 Part I and my Eight Lectures on Yoga. Then there is Vivekananda's Raja Yo ga and several little - known Hindu writers; these latter are very practical and technical, but one really needs to be a Hindu to make much use of them. The former is very good indeed, if your remember to switch off when he slides into sloppiness, which luc kily is not often. To study Magick\" Book 4, Parts II, III (Magick in Theory and Practice) and IV (The Equinox of the Gods.) Add The Book of Thoth and the you are: --- \"Being furnished with complete armour and armed, he i s similar to the goddess.\" Of other writers, you have The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage,\" and any of the works of Eliphaz Lâvi. But that's all. But --- I suppose you knew all this long ago. It may help if I try to expound the essence o f these two Methods in very simple language, and very different language. By contrast and comparison, you should be able, without reading even one of all those books, to get a perfectly clear idea in perspective of \"what's coming to you!\" The process of analysing, developing and controlling the mind is the essence of all Yoga practices. Magick explores and learns to control those regions of Nature which lie beyond the objects of sense. Reaching the highest parts of these regions, called the divine, one proceeds by the exaltation (? = intoxi - cation? Yes, of a sublime sort) of the consciousness to identify oneself with those \"celestial\" Beings. In Yoga, various practices prevent the body and its functions from interrupting the mental process. Then, one inhibits that process"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 321 itself: the stilling of \"thoughts\" allows one to become aware of men - tal functions beyond the intellectual; these functions have their own peculiar properties and powers. Each sheath, as one goes deeper, is discarded as \"unreal;\" f inally one apprehends that nothing which is the only true and real form of existence. (But then it does not exist: in these regions of thought words always become nightmares of self - contradiction. This is as it should be.) In Magick, on the contrary, o ne passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes \"unreal\" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the body of Light; this one develops and con - tro ls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called \"initiation:\" finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe. The first step in Yoga is \"Keep sti ll.\" 48 The first step in Magick is \"Travel beyond the world of the senses.\" There, that is the whole business in a nutshell, and expressed so that anyone, however ignorant of the subject, may grasp the essentials (I hope). Love is th e law, love under will.  Yours fraternally. CHAPTER LXXXII EPISTOLA PENULTIMA: THE TWO WAYS TO REALITY"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 322 Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. How very sensible of you, though I admit somewhat exacting! You write --- Will you tell me exactly why I should devote so much of my valuable time to subjects like Magick and Yoga. That is all very well. But you ask me to put it in syllogistic form. I have no doubt this can be done, though th e task seems somewhat compli - cated. I think I will leave it to you to construct your series of syllogisms yourself from the arguments of this letter. In your main question the operative word is \"valuable.\" Why, I ask, in my turn, should you consider yo ur time valuable? It certainly is not valuable unless the universe has a meaning, and what is more, unless you know what that meaning is --- at least roughly --- it is millions to one that you will find yourself barking up the wrong tree. First of all le t us consider this question of the meaning of the universe. It is its own evidence to design, and that design intelligent design. There is no question of any moral significance --- \"one man's meat is another man's poison\" and so on. But there can be no po ssible doubt about the existence of some kind of intelligence, and that kind is far superior to anything of which we know as human. How then are we to explore, and finally to interpret this intelligence? It seems to me that there are two ways and only tw o. Imagine for a moment that you are an orphan in charge of a guardian, inconceivably learned from your point of view. Suppose therefore that you are puzzled by some problem suitable to your childish nature, your obvious and most simple way is to approac h your guardian and ask him to enlighten you. It is clearly part of his function as guardian to do his best to help you."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 323 Very good, that is the first method, and close parallel with what we understand by the word Magick. We are bothered by some difficult y about one of the elements --- say Fire --- it is therefore natural to evoke a Salamander to instruct you on the difficult point. But you must remember that your Holy Guardian Angel is not only far more fully instructed than yourself on every point that you can conceive, but you may go so far as to say that it is definitely his work, or part of his work; remembering always that he inhabits a sphere or plane which is entirely different 49 from anything of which you are normally aware. To attain to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is consequently without doubt by far the simplest way by which you can yourself approach that higher order of being. That, then, is a clearly intelligible method of procedure. We call it Magick. It is of course possible to strengthen the link between him and your - self so that in course of time you became capable of moving and, generally speaking, operating on that plane which is his natural habitat. There is however one other way, and one only, as far as I can see, of reaching this state. It is at least theoretically possible to exalt the whole of your own consciousness until it becomes as free to move on that exalted plane as it is for him. You should note, by the way, that in this case the p ostulation of another being is not necessary. There is no way of refuting the solipsism if you feel like that."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 324 Personally I cannot accede to its axiom. The evidence for an external universe appears to me perfectly adequate. Still there is no extra charge for thinking on those lines if you so wish. I have paid a great deal of attention in the course of my life to the method of exalting the human consciousness in this way; and it is really quite legitimate to identify my teaching with that of the Yogis. I must however point out that in the course of my instruction I have given continual warnings as to the dangers of this line of research. For one thing there is no means of checking your results in the ordi - nary scientific sense. It is always perfectly ea sy to find a subjective explanation of any phenomenon; and when one considers that the greatest of all the dangers in any line of research arise from egocentric vanity, I do not think I have exceeded my duty in anything that I have said to deter students f rom undertaking so dangerous a course as Yoga. It is, of course, much safer if you are in a position to pursue in the Indian Jungles, provided that your health will stand the climate and also, I must say, unless you have a really sound teacher on whom you can safely rely. But then, if we once introduce a teacher, why not go to the Fountain - head and press towards the Knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel? In any case your Indian teacher will ultimately direct you to seek guidance from that source, so it seems to me that you have gone to a great deal of extra trouble and incurred a great deal of unnecessary danger by not leaving yourself in the first place in the hands of the Holy Guardian Angel. In any case there are the two methods which stand as alternatives. I"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 325 do not know of any third one which can be of any use whatever. Logi - cally, since you have asked me to be logical, there is certainly no third way; there is the external way of Magick, and the internal way of Yoga: there you have your alternatives, and there they cease. Love is the law, love under will. 50 CHAPTER LXXXIII  EPISTOLA ULTIMA Cara Soror, Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. The suggestion in your last letter to me is a very sensible one. I do think that people in general would like to get some idea of my system of training as a whole, in a comprehensive form. In the past there has been far too much of referring them to one quite unprocurabl e document and then to another which probably has not even been written. No wonder that they go away sorrowful. So I am going to put in as the last of this series of Letters an account, as clear and as succinct as the gods enable me to do, of what they m ay expect to have to do to get good marks from Grandfather. Of course I shall not be able to avoid altogether reference to the various official documents, but I will make these as short and as few as I can. First of all then, my system can be divided int o two parts. Apparently diametrically opposed, but at the end converging, the one helping the other until the final method of progress partakes equally of both ele - ments."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 326 For convenience I shall call the first method Magick, and the second method Yoga. The opposition between these is very plain for the direction of Magick is wholly outward, that of Yoga wholly inward. I will deal first then with Magick. How do I define this word? Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in accordance with the will. (Obviously then all scientific methods can be included in this term.) I have to assume in all that follows that you have thoroughly under - stood the doctrine of 0 = 2. All Magical action may be classed as under the formula of progression from the \"0\" to the \"2\"; in other words it is complete extraversion. The aspiring Magician only analyses himself for the purpose of finding new worlds to conquer. His first objective is the astral plane; its discovery, the classification of its tenants, and their control. All his early practises therefore are devoted to exploring the worlds which surround (if you choose, or if your prefer --- are contained in) the object of sense. If there is a tree in your garden, you want to find out whether that tree is occupied by a nymph or a nat, and if so, what are they like? How do they act? How can you make them useful to your purpose? It is in fact the ordinary every - day scientific method of exploration. The only difference is that in the course of one's ex periments one becomes aware of parts of the nature of the object to be examined which are subtler and perhaps more powerful, nearer to reality, than those which ordinary scientific examination discloses. You will notice, however, that the qualities above - m entioned are iden - tical. The chemical elements which go to form a tree are subtler,"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 327 51 more powerful and nearer to reality than the tree as it is presented to the senses. Finally, we reach the conception of molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons and so on, and nobody needs telling nowadays what unfathomable potencies lie hidden in the atom. When I say subtler, moreover, I mean it. The analysis of matter has resulted in the extraordinary discovery that the definition of matter as given b y the physicist of to - day is very similar indeed to the definition of spirit as stated by the mystics of the middle ages. Henry Poincarâ has well pointed out that the results of scientific experiment as we know them, are altogether in their way dependant on the existence of our own peculiar natures. If, for example, we had no sense to use in our exploration but that of hearing, we should have worked out a classification of trees entirely different from that which we now possess. We should have taught our students how to distinguish the sounds made by an oak and an elm respectively in a storm; the differences in the rustling of various kinds of grass, and so on. Similarly the results of our magical experiments are naturally and necessarily very distinct f rom those which we obtain by ordinary methods. to begin with we must build up an apparatus of examination, and this we do by discovering and developing qualities in our own sturc - ture which ware suitable for the purpose. The first step is the separation of (what we call, for convenience) the"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 328 astral body from the physical body. As our experiments proceed, we find that our astral body itself can be divided into grosser and subtler com - ponents. In this way we become aware of the existence of what we call , for convenience, the Holy Guardian Angel, and the more we realise the implications of the theory of the existence of such a being, the clearer it becomes that our supreme task is to put ourselves into intimate communication with him. For one thing, we s hall find that in the object of sense which we examine there are elements which resist our examination. We must raise ourselves to a plane in which we obtain complete control of such. It is found furthermore in the course of experiment that a great many of the apparent differences in our study conceal a hidden unity, and vice versa. Like every other science, both the subject and the object of the work increase as that work proceeds. Take a simple matter like Mathematics as our analogy. The schoolboy st ruggling with the Rule of Three is a very rudimentary image of the advanced mathematician working on the differential calculus. From the above it ought to be clear to you that I have said all that really needs to be said in explaining the whole of Magick as the science and art of extending, first in oneself, one's own faculties, secondly in external nature their hidden characteristics. Before closing the subject entirely I think it well to point out that there are quite a number of worlds on which a good deal of work remains to be done. In particular I cannot refrain from mentioning the work of Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly. My own work on this subject has been so "},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 329 52 elaborate and extensive that I shall never sufficiently regret that I never had a n opportunity of completing it, but I should like to empha - size that the obtaining of a book like Liber 418 is in itself so outstanding an achievement that it should serve as an encouragement to all Magicians. In the case of many worlds, in particular th at of Abra Melin, of the greater and lesser Keys of Solomon, of Pietro di Abano, of Cornelius Agrippa, while we have perfectly adequate information as to the methods we have very meagre examples of the results, especially so far as refers to the technical side of the work. I must conclude with a warning. So many of these branches of magick are so fascinating that any one of them is liable to take hold of the Magician by the short hair and upset his balance completely. It should never be forgotten for a s ingle moment that the central and essential work of the Magicians is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversa - tion of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invari - ably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step --- crossing of the abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple. Anything apart from this course is a side issue and unless so regarded may lead to the complete ruin of the whole work of the Magician.  II The second part of this letter, which appears to be expanding into a sort of essay, will be devoted to Yoga. You will have noticed that the grade of Master of the Temple is itself intimately associated with Yoga."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 330 It is when one reaches this plane that the apparently contradictory forms of the Great Work, Magick and Yoga, begin to converge, though even earlier in the course of the work it must have been noticed that achieve - ments in Yoga have been of great assistance to magical operations, and that many of the mental states necessary to the development of the Magician are identical with those attained in the course of the strictly technical Yogic operations. The literature necessary to the study of Magick is somewhat variegated; there are quite a number of classics on the subject and though it would be easy enough for me to draw up a list of not more than half - a dozen which I consider really essential, there may be as many as an hund red which in the more or less subsidiary forms are useful to the magician. With Yoga the case is very different indeed. The literature on the subject is so enormous and contains so vast a number of more or less secret documents which circulate from hand to hand, that I believe that the best advice I can give anyone is to cut one's cloth very sparingly if one is to make a fitting suit. I do not think I am going too far if I say that Part I of Book 4 and my Eight Lectures on Yoga form an absolutely suffici ent guide to the useful practise of the subject; anything else is almost certain to operate as a distraction. Swami Vivekananda summarised Yoga under four headings, and I do not think that one can improve on that classification. His four are: Gnana, Raja , Bhakti and Hatha, and comprise all divisions that it is desirable to make. As soon as one begins to add such sections as Mantra Yoga, you 53"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 331 are adding to without enriching the classification, and once you begin where are you to stop? But I hon estly believe that the excessive simplication given in Eight Lectures on Yoga is a practical advantage. Any given type of Yogas is the work of a lifetime and for that reason alone it is desirable to confine oneself from the beginning to an absolutely simpl e programme. What then is the difference between Yoga and Magick? Magick is extra - verson, the discovery of and subsequently the classification of and finally the control of new worlds on new planes. So far as it concerns the development of the mind its object and method are perfectly simple. What is wanted is exaltation. The aim is to identify oneself with the highest essence of whatever world is under consideration. With Yoga you might easily slip into saying that it was identical, with the exception that the new worlds are from the start recognised as already existing within the human cosmos, but nobody is asked to extend these worlds in any way; on the contrary the object is to analyse ever more minutely, and the control to which one approaches is n ot external but internal. At all times one is concentrated on the idea of simpli - cation. The recognition of any new idea or form of ideas, is invariably the signal for its rejection: \"not that, not that.\" One might simplify this explanation by construc ting some sort of apophthegm; Magick is the journey from 0 to 2, Yoga from 2 to 0. It is a very good rule for the Yogi to keep this mind constantly fixed on the fact that any idea soever is false. There is actually a Hindu proverb \"That which can be thou ght is not true.\" consequently the existence of any idea in the mind is an immediate refutation of it, but equally the contraries as well as contradictory of that idea are"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 332 false, and the result of this is to knock the second law of formal logic to pieces. One puts up a sort of sorites --- A is B, therefore A is not B; therefore not A is not B; and all these contrary statements are equally false, but in order to realise this fact they must themselves be announced by the mind as ecstatic discoveries of trut h. The result of all this naturally is that the mind very rapidly becomes a discredited instrument, and one attains to a totally different and much more exalted type of mind, and the same destructive criticism which one applied to the original consciousne ss applies equally to this higher consciousness, and one gets to one higher still which is again destroyed. In The Equinox, Vol. I there is an essay called \"The Soldier and the Hunchback: ! and ?\" In Liber Aleph too there are several chapters about attai nment by what is called the Method of Ladders. All these operations are equally valid and equally invalid, and the result of this is that the whole subject of Yoga leads to constantly increasing confusion. The fineness of the analytical instrument seems to defeat its own purpose and it is perhaps because of that confession that I have always felt in my deepest consciousness that the method of Magick is on the whole less dangerous than that of Yoga. This is parti - cularly the case when discussing these ma tters with a Western mind. It is true that our 0 = 2 formula remains infinitely useful because it is of such potency in destroying the scepticism which so often dis - 54 "},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 333 heartens one, especially in the highest realms of Magick. The criticism which the enemy directs against your sun - kissed tower is thrown back from those glittering walls, You accept the criticism at the same time as you dismiss it with a laugh. On the whole therefore I continue to regard the discipline of Yoga as its most valuable feature. The results attained by pushing Yoga to its end are on their own showing worthless, whereas the attainment of Magick, however lofty, is still immune to all criticism and at every period of its construction has been perfectly sympathetic with the normal conscious - ness of man. On this view indeed, one might laughingly remark that Yoga at its best is a smoke - screen thrown out by a battleship in self - protection. It may seem to you strange as you read this letter to have watched how the pendulum ha s swung always a little more and more towards the side of Magick. I do not know why this should have been, but that it is so I have no doubt whatever. I see quite clearly now that Yoga from its very first beginnings is liable to lead the mind away into a condition of muddle, and though for each such state Yoga itself provides the necessary cure, may not one ask oneself if it is really wise to begin one's work with axioms and postulates which are inherently dangerous. The whole controversy might be express ed as a differential equation. Their curves become identical only at infinity, and there is no doubt, at least to my mind, that the curve of Magick follows a more pleasant track than that of Yoga. To take one point alone: it is evidently more satisfactory to have one's malignant demons external to oneself. As I have written it has become clearer to me that this is the case,"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"MAGIC WITHOUT TEARS Get any book for free on: www.Abika.com 334 but I should not like you to arise from its perusal with any idea that I have been in some way derogating Yoga. I would not like to maintain that it is necessary to Magick because there have been many very great magicians who knew nothing at all of the subject but I am just as strongly convinced as I was before that the practice of Yoga in itself is of enormous assistance to the Magici an in his more intelligible path, only adding that he should beware lest the logical antinomies inherent in Yoga divert him from or discourage him in his simple path.
