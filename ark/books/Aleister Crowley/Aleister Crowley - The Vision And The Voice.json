And the voice said: Thy fear is known; thine ignorance is known; thy weakness is known; but thou art nothing in this matter.

And now the lion passeth over through the ∆thyr with the crowned beast upon his back, a nd the tail of the lion goes on instead of stopping, and on each hair of the tail is something or otherósometimes a little house, sometimes a planet, at other times a town. Then there is a gr eat plain with soldiers fighting upon it, and an enormously high mountain carved into a thousand temples, and more houses and fi elds and trees, and great cities with wonderful buildings in them, statues and columns and public buildings generally. This goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on all on the hairs of this lion's tail. And then there is the tuft of hi s tail, which is like a comet, but the head is a new universe, and each hair streaming away from it is a Milky Way.

I stand in the shower of it. And a voice proceeds from the rose: Come away! Our chariot is drawn by doves.

It is surrounded by an innumerable company of angels; these angels are of all kinds,ósome brilliant and flashing as gods, down to elemental creatures. The light comes and goes on the tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive that each letter of the tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a language which looks like that of Honorius; but wh en I would read, the letter that I look at becomes indistinct at once. And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing. This Angel has all th e colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud and beautiful; his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and black, like cascad es of water, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of the seven holy metals, upon which he plays. I cannot tell you how wonderf ul the music is, but it is so wonderful that one only lives in oneís ears; one cannot see anything any more. Now he stops playing and moves with his finger in the air. His finger leaves a trail of fire of every colour, so that the whole Aire is become like a web of mi ngled lights. But through it all drops dew. (I can't describe these things at all. Dew doesn't represent what I mean in the least. For instance, these drops of dew are enormous globes, shining like the full moon, only perfectly transparent, as well as perfectly luminous.) And now he shows the tablet ag ain, and he says: As there are 49 letters in the tablet, so are there 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God. And there are 49 interpretations of every cosmos, and each interpretation is manifested in 49 ways. Thus also are the calls 49 , but to each call there are 49 visions. And each vision"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 28 is composed of 49 elements, except in the 10 th ∆thyr, that is accursËd, and that hath 42 . All this while the dewdrops have turned into cascades of gold finer than the eyelashes of a little child. And though the extent of the ∆thyr is so enormous, one pe rceives each hair separately, as well as the whole thing at once. And now there is a mighty concourse of angels rushing toward me from every side, and they melt upon the surface of the egg in which I am standing in the form of the god Kneph, so that the surface of the egg is all one dazzling blaze of liquid light. Now I move up against the ta blet,óI cannot tell you with what rapture. And all the name s of God, that are not known even to the angels, clothe me about. All the seven senses are transmuted into one sense, and that sense is dissolved in itself . . . (H ere occurs Samadhi.) . . . Let me speak, O God; let me declare it . . . all. It is useless; my heart faints, my breath stops. There is no link between me and P . . . I withdraw myself. I see the table again. (He was behind the table for a very long time. O.V.) And all the table burns with in tolerable light; there has been no such light in any of the ∆t hyrs until now. And now the table draws me back into itself; I am no more. My arms were out in the form of a cross, and that Cross was extended, blazing with light into infinity. I myself am the minutest point in it. This is the birth of form . I am encircled by an immense sphere of many-coloured bands; it seems it is the sphere of the Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions. This is the birth of death . Now in the centre within me is a glowing sun. That is the birth of hell . Now all that is swept away, wash ed away by the table. It is the virtue of the table to sweep ev erything away. It is the letter I in this ∆thyr that gives this vision, and L is its purity, and N is its energy. Now everything is confused, for I invoked the Mind, that is disruption. Every Adept who beholds this vision is corrupted"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 29 by mind. Yet it is by virtue of mi nd that he endures it, and passes on, if so be that he pass on. Yet there is nothing higher than this, for it is perfectly balanced in itsel f. I cannot read a word of the holy Table, for the letters of th e Table are all wrong. They are only the shadows of shadows. And whoso beholdeth this Table with this rapture, is light. Th e true word for light hath seven letters. They are the same as ARARITA, transmuted. There is a voice in this ∆thyr , but it cannot be spoken. The only way one can represent it is as a ceaseless thundering of the word Amen. It is not a repetition of Amen, because there is no time. It is one Amen continuous. Shall mine eye fade before thy gl ory? I am the eye. That is why the eye is seventy. You can never understand why, except in this vision. And now the table recedes from me. Far, far it goes, streaming with light. And ther e are two black angels bending over me, covering me with their wings, shutting me up into the darkness; and I am lying in the Pastos of our Father Christian Rosenkreutz, beneath the Table in the Vault of seven sides. And I hear these words: The voice of the Crowned Child, the Speech of the Babe that is hidden in the egg of blue. (Before me is the flaming Rosy Cross.) I have opened mine eye, and the universe is dissolved before me, for force is mine uppe r eye-lid and matter is my lower eye-lid. I gaze into the seven spaces, and there is naught. The rest of it comes without words; and then again: I have gone forth to war, and I have slain him that sat upon the sea, crowned with the winds. I put forth my power and he was broken. I withdrew my power and he was ground into fine dust. Rejoice with me, O ye Sons of the Morning; stand with me upon the Throne of Lotus; gath er yourselves up unto me, and we shall play together in the fields of light. I have passed into the Kingdom of the West after my Father. Behold! where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation?

In the nights we will dance together, and in the morning we will go forth to war; for, as my Father liveth that was dead, so do I live and shall never die. And now the table comes rushing back. It covers the whole stone, but this time it pushes me before it, and a terrible voice cries: Begone! Thou hast profaned the my stery; thou hast eaten of the shew-bread; thou hast spilt the consecrated wine! Begone! For the Voice is accomplished. Begone! For that which was open is shut. And thou shalt not avail to open it, saving by virtue of him whose name is one, whose spirit is one, whose individuum is one, and whose permutation is one; w hose light is one, whose life is one, whose love is one. For though thou art joined to the inmost mystery of the heaven, thou must accomplish the sevenfold task of the earth, even as thou sawest the Angels from the greatest unto the least. And of all this shalt thou take back with thee but a little part, for the sense shall be darkened, and the shrine re-veiled. Yet know this for thy reproof, and for the stirring up of discontent in them whose swords are of lath, that in every word of this vision is concealed the key of many mysteries, even of being, and of knowledge, and of bliss; of will, of courage, of wisdom, and of silence, and of that which, being all these, is greater than all these. Begone! For the night of life is fallen upon thee. And the veil of light hideth that which is. With that, I suddenly see the world as it is, and I am very sorrowful. BOU-SAADA.

A mighty wind rolls through all the ∆thyr; there is a sense of absolute emptiness; no colour, no form, no substance. Only now and then there seem as it were, the shadows of great angels, swept along. No sound; there is someth ing very remorseless about the wind, passionless, that is very te rrible. In a way, it is nerve- shaking. It seems as if someth ing kept on trying to open behind the wind, and just as it is about to open, the effort is exhausted. The wind is not cold or hot; there is no sense of any kind connected with it. One does not even feel it, for one is standing in front of it. Now, the thing opens behind, ju st for a second, and I catch a glimpse of an avenue of pillars, and at the end a throne, supported by sphinxes. All this is black marble. Now I seem to have gone through the wind, and to be standing before the throne; but he that sitteth thereon is invisible. Yet it is from him that all this desolation proceeds. He is trying to make me unde rstand by putting tastes in my mouth, very rapidly one after th e other. Salt, honey, sugar, assafoetida, bitumen, honey again, some taste that I don't know at all; garlic, something very bitter like nux vomica, another taste, still more bitter; lemon, cloves, rose-leaves, honey again; the juice of some plant, like a dandelion, I think; honey again, salt, a taste something like phosphorus, honey, laurel, a very unpleasant taste which I don't know, coffee, then a bur ning taste, then a sour taste that I don't know. All these tast es issue from his eyes; he signals them. I can see his eyes now. They are very round, with perfectly black pupils, perfectly white iris, and the cornea pale blue. The sense of desolation is so acute that I keep on trying to get away from the vision. I told him that I could not understand his taste-language, so instead he set up a humming very much like a big electric plant with dynamos going."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 32 Now the atmosphere is deep night-blue; and by the power of that atmosphere, the pillars kindle to a dull glowing crimson, and the throne is a dull, ruddy gold. And now, through the humming, come very clear, bell-like notes, and farther still a muttering, like that of a gathering storm. And now I hear the meaning of the muttering: I am he who was before the beginning, and in my desolation I cried aloud, saying, let me behold my countenance in the concave of the abyss. And I beheld, and lo! in the darkness of the abyss my countenance was black, and empty, a nd distorted, that was (once) invisible and pure. Then I closed mine eye, that I might not behold it, and for this was it fixed. Now it is writte n that one glance of mine eye shall destroy it. And mine eye I dare not open, because of the foulness of the vision. Therefor e do I gaze with these two eyes throughout the Êon. Is there not one of all my adepts that shall come unto me, and cut off mine eyelids, that I may behold and destroy? Now I take a dagger, and, searchi ng out his third eye, seek to cut off the eye-lids, but they are of adamant. And the edge of the dagger is turned. And tears drop from his eyes, and there is a mournful voice: So it hath been ever: so must it ever be! Though thou hast the strength of five bulls, thou shalt not avail in this. And I said to him: Who shall avail? And he answered me: I know not. But the dagger of pe nance thou shalt temper seven times, afflicting the seven courses of thy soul. And thou shalt sharpen its edge seven times by the seven ordeals. (One keeps on looking round to try to find something else because of the terror of it. But nothing changes at all. Nothing but the empty throne, and the eyes, and the avenue of pillars!)

He speaks; I cannot hear a wo rd; something about the Book of the Law. The answer is wr itten in the Book of the Law, or something of that sort. This is a long speech; all that I can hear is: From me pour down the fires of life and incr ease continually upon the earth. From me flow down the rivers of water and oil and wine. From me cometh forth the wind that beareth the seed of trees and flowers and fruits and all herbs upon its bosom. From me cometh forth the earth in her unspeakable variety. Yea! all cometh from me, naught cometh to me. Ther efore am I lonely and horrible upon this unprofitable throne. Only those who accept nothing from me can bring anything to me. (He goes on speaking again: I cannot hear a word. I may have got about a twentieth of what he said.) And I say to him: It was written that his name is Silence, but thou speakest continually. And he answers: Nay, the muttering that thou hearest is not my voice. It is the voice of the ape. (When I say that he answers, it means that it is the same voice. The being on the throne has not uttered a word.) I say: O thou ape that speakest for Him whos e name is Silence, how shall I know that thou speakest truly His thought? And the muttering continues: Nor speaketh He nor thinketh, so that which I say is true, because I lie in speaking His thoughts. He goes on, nothing stops him; and the muttering comes so fast that I cannot hear him at all. Now the muttering has ceased, or is overwhelmed by the bells, and the bells in their turn are overwhelmed by the whirring, and now the whirring is overwhelm ed by the silence.

The higher you go, the greater is the distance from one grade to another. I am being slowly pushed backwards down the avenue, out into the wind. And this time I am caught up by the wind and whirled away down it like a dead leaf. And a great Angel sweeps through the wind, and catches hold of me, and bears me up against it; and he sets me down on the hither side of the wind, and he wh ispers in my ear: Go thou forth into the world, O thrice and four times blessed who hast gazed upon the horror of the loneliness of The First.

And there cometh a peacock into the stone, filling the whole Aire. It is like the vision called the Universal Peacock, or, rather, like a representation of that vision. And now there are countless clouds of white angels filling the Aire as the peacock dissolves. Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets.

This one wheel is fort y-nine wheels, set at different angles, so that they compose a sphere; each wheel has forty-nine spokes, and has forty-nine concentric tyres at equal distances from the centre. And wherever the rays from any two wheels meet, there is a blinding flash of glory. It must be understood that though so much detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time the impression is of a single, simple object. It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand. Though the wheel fills the whole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel. And though this vision is so great and splendid, yet there is no seriousness with it, or solemn ity.

The rim of the wheel is a vivid emerald snake; in the centre of the wheel is a scarlet h eart; and, impossible to explain as it is, the scarlet of the heart and the green of the snake are yet more vivid than the blinding white brilliance of the wheel. The figures on the wheel are darker than the wheel itself; in fact, they are stains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and because of the whirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top seems to be the Lamb and Flag, such as one sees on some Christian medals, and one of the lower things is a wolf, and the other a raven. The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter than the other two. It keeps on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than the wheel itself, and occupies more space than it did. It speaks: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and innocence shall seduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come to the centre of the wheel. The wolf betrayeth only the greedy and the treacherous; the raven betrayeth only the melancholy and the dishonest. But I am he of whom it is written: He shall deceive the very elect. For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spirits that they might sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to the three impure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven for the lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all to simulate the pure prompting of the soul. Them that are fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven I have not scathed; but them that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrath of the raven and the wolf . And the jaws of the one have torn them, and the beak of the other has devoured the corpse. Therefore is my flag white, b ecause I have left nothing upon the earth alive.

(His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven sulphur.) Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel, and the hand that whirleth it. And I said: ìBy the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; by the word that is seve n, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible word 210 , I beseech thee, O my Lord, to grant me the vision of thy glory.î And all the rays of the wheel stream out at me, and I am blasted and blinded with the light. I am caught up into the wheel. I am one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel. In the midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face. (I am thrown viol ently back on to the earth every second, so that I cannot quite concentrate.) All one gets is a liquid flame of pale gold. But its radiant force keeps hurling me back. And I say: By the word and th e will, by the penance and the prayer, let me behold thy face. (I cannot explain this, there is confusion of personalities.) I who speak to you, see what I tell you; but I, who see him, cannot communicate it to me, who speak to you. If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be like the substance of him. But the light is without heat. It is the vision of Ut in the Upanishads. And from this vision have come all the legends of Bacchus and Krishna and Adonis.

Even the hand that turns the wheel is not hi s hand, but only a hand energized by him. And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his victim. My form is the form of the God Phtah, in my essence, but the form of the god Se b in my form.

I am only in the outer court of the vision, because I have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must retain sense and speech. No recorded vision is perfect, of high visions, for the seer must keep either his physical organs or his memory in working order. And neither is capable. There is no bridge. One can only be conscious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness move s nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and ment al. Even so, the body and the mind must be very perfect befo re anything can be done, or the energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and the mind into insanity. This is why the first visions give Ananda, which is a shock. When the adept is a ttuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace. This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is I. And herefore the human ego is being constantly excited, so that one comes back so often. An acentric meditation practice like mahasatipatthana ought to be done before invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, so that th e ego may be very ready to yield itself utterly to the Beloved.

I insist. The little gate is guarded by a great green dragon. And now the whole wall is suddenly fallen away; there is a blaze of the chariots and the horsemen; a furious battle is raging. One hears nothing but the clash of steel and the neighing of the chargers and the shrieks of the wounded. A t housand fall at every encounter and are trampled under foot. Yet the ∆thyr is always full; there are infinite reserves. No; that is all wrong, for this is not a battle between two forces, but a mélée in which each warrior fights for himself against all the others. I cannot see one who has even one ally. And the least fortunate, who fall soonest, are those in the chariots. For as soon as they are engaged in fighting, their own charioteers stab them in the back.

And now all the warriors are dead, and they are the ripe fruits that are fallenóthe ground is covered with them.

And dimly dawning in this unu tterable gloom, far, far above, is the face that is the face of a man and of a woman, and upon the brow is a circle, and upon the breast is a circle, and in the palm of the right hand is a circle. Gigantic is his stature, and he hath the Uraeus crown, and the leopard's skin, and the flaming orange apron of a god.

December 2, 1909. 4.50-6.5 p.m. T HE C RY OF THE 15 TH ∆ THYR , WHICH IS CALLED OXO There appears immediately in the ∆thyr a tremendous column of scarlet fire, whirling forth, rebounding, crying aloud. And about it are four columns of green and blue and gold and silver, each inscribed with writings in the ch aracter of the dagger. And the column of fire is dancing among the pillars. Now it seems that the fire is but the skirt of the dancer, and the dancer is a mighty god. The vision is over-powering. As the dancer whirls, she chants in a strange, slow voice, quickening as she goes: Lo! I gath er up every spirit that is pure, and weave him into my vesture of flame. I lick up the lives of men, and their souls sparkle from mine eyes. I am the mighty sorceress, the lust of the spirit. And by my dancing I gather for my mother Nuit the head s of all them that are baptized in the waters of life. I am the lust of the spirit that eateth up the soul of man. I have prepared a f east for the adepts, and they that partake thereof shall see God. Now it is clear what she has woven in her dance; it is the Crimson Rose of 49 Petals, and the Pillars are the Cross with which it is conjoined. And between the pillars shoot out rays of pure green fire; and now all the pillars are golden. She ceases to dance, and dwindles, gathering herself into the centre of the Rose. Now it is seen that the Rose is a vast ampitheatre, with seven tiers, each tier divided into seven pa rtitions. And they that sit in the Amphitheatre are the seven grades of the Order of the Rosy Cross. This Amphitheatre is built of rose-coloured marble, and of its size I can say only that the sun might be used as a ball to be thrown by the players in the arena. But in the arena there is a"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 55 little altar of emerald, and its top has the heads of the Four Beasts, in turquoise and rock-crystal. And the floor of the arena is ridged like a grating of lapis lazuli. And it is full of pure quicksilver. Above the altar is a veiled Figur e, whose name is Pan. Those in the outer tier adore him as a Man; and in the next tier they adore him as a Goat; and in the ne xt tier they adore him as a Ram; and in the next tier they adore hi m as a Crab; and in the next tier they adore him as an Ibis; and in the next tier they adore him as a Golden Hawk; and in the next tier they adore him not. And now the light streameth out from the altar, splashed out by the feet of him that is above it. It is the Holy Twelve-fold Table of OIT. The voice of him that is above the altar is silence, but the echo thereof cometh back from the walls of the circus, and is speech. And this is the speech: Th ree and four are the days of a quarter of the moon, and on the seventh day is the sabbath, but thrice four is the Sabbath of the Adepts whereof the form is revealed in the ∆thyr ZID; that is the eighth of the Aires. And the mysteries of the Table shall not be wholly revealed, nor shall they be revealed herein. But thou shalt gather of the sweat of thy brow a pool of clear water wherein this shall be revealed. And of the oil that thou burnest in the midnight shall be gathered together thirteen rivers of blessing; a nd of the oil and the water I will prepare a wine to intoxicate the young men and the maidens. And now the Table is become th e universe; every star is a letter of the Book of Enoch. A nd the Book of Enoch is drawn therefrom by an inscrutable Myst ery, that is known only to the Angels and the Holy Sevenfold Ta ble. While I have been gazing upon this table, an Adept has come forth, one from each tier, except the inmost Tier. And the first drove a dagger into my heart, and tasted the blood, and said: caqar“j , caqar“j , caqar“j , caqar“j , caqar“j, caqar“j . And the second Adept has been te sting the muscles of my right arm and shoulder, and he says: fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis, fortis."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 56 And the third Adept examines the skin and tastes the sweat of my left arm, and says: TAN, TAN, TAN, TAN. And the fourth Adept examines my neck, and seems to approve, though he says nothing; and he hath opened the right half of my brain, and he make s some examination, and says: ìSamajh, samajh, samajh.î And the fifth Adept examines th e left half of my brain, and then holds up his hand in protest, and says ìPLA . . .î (I cannot get the sentence, but the meaning is : In the thick darkness the seed awaiteth spring.) And now am I again rapt in cont emplation of that universe of letters which are stars. The words ORLO, ILRO, TULE ar e three most secret names of God. They are Magick names, each having an interpretation of the same kind as the interpretation of I.N.R.I., and the name OIT, RLU, LRL, OOE are other names of God, that contain magical formulae, the first to invoke fire; the second, water; the third, air; and the fourth, earth. And if the Table be read dia gonally, every letter, and every combination of letters, is the name of a devil. And from these are drawn the formulae of evil magick. But the holy letter I above the triad LLL dominateth the Table, a nd preserveth the peace of the universe. And in the seven talismans about the central Table are contained the Mysteries of draw ing forth the letters. And the letters of the circumference d eclare in glory of Nuit, that beginneth from Aries*. All this while the Adepts must have been chanting as it were an oratorio for seven instruments. And this oratorio hath one dominant theme of rapture. Yet it applieth to every detail of the universe as well as to the whol e. And herein is Choronzon brought utterly to ruin, that all hi s work is against his will, not only in the whole, but in every pa rt thereof, even as a fly that * Note that the corner letters in this table are all B = > ."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 57 walketh upon a beryl-stone. And the tablet blazeth ever br ighter till it filleth the whole Aire. And behold! there is is one God therein, and the letters of the stars in his crown, Orion, and the Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and Alpha Centauri, and Cor Le onis, and Cor Scorpionis, and Spica, and the pole-star, and He rcules, and Regulus, and Aquila, and the Ramís Eye. And upon a map of the stars shalt thou draw the sigil of that name; and because also some of the letters are alike, thou shalt know that the stars also have trib es and nations. The letter of a star is but the totem thereof. And the letter representeth not the whole nature of the star, but each star must be known by itself in the wisdom of him that hath the Cynocephalus in leash. And this pertaineth unto the grade of a Magusóand that is beyond thine. (All this is communicated not by voice, or by writing; and there is no form in the stone, but only the brilliance of the Table. And now I am withdrawn from all that, but the Rosy Cross of 49 petals is set upright upon the summit of a pyramid, and all is dark, because of the exceeding light behind.) And there cometh a voice: The fly cried unto the ox, ìBeware! Strengthen thyself. Se t thy feet firmly upon the earth, for it is my purpose to alight be tween thy shoulders, and I would not harm thee.î So also are th ey who wish well unto the Masters of the Pyramid. And the bee said unto the flower: ìGive me of thine honey,î and the flower gave richly ther eof; but the bee, though he wit it not, carried the seed of the flower into many fields of sun. So also are they that take unto them selves the Masters of the Pyramid for servants. Now the exceeding light that was behind the Pyramid, and the Rosy Cross that is set there on, hath fulfilled the whole Aire. The black Pyramid is like the back of a black diamond. Also the Rosy Cross is loosened, and the pe tals of the Rose are the mingled hues of sunset and of dawn; and the Cross is the Golden light of noon, and in the heart of the Rose th ere is the secret light that men call midnight."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 58 And a voice: ìGlory to God and thanksgiving to God, and there is no God but God.

And an angel clad in blue and scarlet, with golden wings a nd plumes of purple fire, comes forth and scatters disks of green and gold, filing all the Aire. And they become swiftly-whirling wheels, singing together. And the voice of the angel cries: Gather up thy garments about thee,* O thou that hast entered the circle of the Sabbath; for in thy grave-clothes shouldest thou behold the resurrection. The flesh hangeth upon thee like his rags upon a beggar that is a pilgrim to the shrine of the Exalted One. Nevertheless, bear them bravely, and rejoice in the beauty thereof, for the company of the pilgrims is a glad compa ny, and they have no care, and with song and dance and wine and fair women do they make merry. And every hostel is their place, and every maid their queen.

And the voice says, There is no light or knowledge or beauty or stability in the Kingdom of the Grave, whither thou goest. And the worm is crowned. All that thou wast hath he eaten up, and all that thou art is his pasture until to -morrow. And all that thou shalt be is nothing.

But I go on tearing down the veil that I may behold the vision of UTA, and hear the voice thererof. And there is a voice: He hath drawn the black bean. And another voice answers it: Not otherwise could he plant the Rose. And the first voice: He hath drunk of the waters of death. Th e answer: Not otherwise could he water the Rose. And the first voice: He hath burnt himself at the Fires of life. And the answer: Not otherwise could he sun the Rose. And the first voice is so faint that I cannot hear it. But the answer is: Not otherwise could he pluck the Rose. And still I go on, struggling with the blackness. Now there is an earthquake. The veil is torn into thousands of pieces that go flying away in a whirling wind. And there is an all-glorious Angel before me, standing in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.

And it shall not be spoken in sight of the sun. Therefore I withdraw myself. (Thus far the vision upon Da'leh Addin, a mountain in the desert near Bou-S‚ada.)

The blackness gathers about, so th ick, so clinging, so penetrating, so oppressive, that all the other darkness that I have ever conceived would be like bright light beside it.

O thou that art master of the Pentag ram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg? Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon.

This seems to be the chariot of the Seventh Key of Tarot. But it is drawn by four sphinxes, diverse, like the four sphinxes upon the door of the vault of the adepts, counterchanged in their component parts. The chariot itself is the lunar crescent, waning. The canopy is supported by eight pillars of am ber. These pillars are upright, and yet the canopy which they suppor t is the whole vault of the night. The charioteer is a man in golden armour, studded with sapphires, but over his shoulders is a white robe, and over that a red robe. Upon his goldenhelmet he beareth for his crest a crab. His hands are clasped upon a cup, from which radiates a ruddy glow, constantly increasing, so that everything is blotted out by its glory, and the whole Aire is filled with it. And there is a marvelous perfume in the Aire, like unto the perfume of Ra Hoor Khuit, but s ublimated, as if the quintessence of that perfume alone were burnt. For it hath the richness and voluptuousness and humanity of blood, and the strength and freshness of meal, and the sweetness of honey, and the purity of olive-oil, and the holiness of that oil which is made of myrrh, and cinnamon, and galangal. The charioteer speaks in a low, solemn voice, awe-inspiring, like a large and very distan t bell: Let him look upon the cup"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 68 whose blood is mingled therein, for the wine of the cup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, that ri deth upon the Beast, for she hath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth and lo! she hath mingled it in the cup of her whoredom. With the breath of her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become the wine of the Sacr ament, the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly ha th she poured it out for her worshippers, and they had become drunken thereon, so that face to face they beheld my Father. Thus are they made worthy to become partakers of the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the blood is the life. So sitteth she from age to age, and the righteous are never weary of her kisses, and by her murders and fornications she seduceth the world. Therein is manifested the glory of my Father, who is truth. (This wine is such that its virtue radiateth through the cup, and I reel under the intoxication of it. And every thought is destroyed by it. It abideth alone , and its name is Compassion. I understand by ìCompassion,î the sacrament of suffering, partaken by the true worshippers of the Highest. And it is an ecstasy in which there is no trace of pain. Its passivity (=passion) is like the giving-up of the self to the beloved.) The voice continues: This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of abominations, and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself to everything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its myster y. And because she hath made herself the servant of each, therefor e is she become the mistress of all. Not as yet canst thou comprehend her glory.

Now, through the ruddy glow of the cup, I may perceive far above, and infinitely great, the vision of Babylon. And the Beast whereon she rideth is the Lord of the City of the Pyramids, that I beheld in the fourteenth ∆thyr. Now that is gone in the glow of the cup, and the Angel saith: Not as yet mayest thou understand th e mystery of the Beast, for it pertaineth not unto the mystery of this Aire, and few that are new- born unto Understanding are capable thereof. The cup glows ever brighter and fierier. All my sense is unsteady, being smitten with ecstasy. And the Angel sayeth: Blessed ar e the saints, that their blood is mingled in the cup, and can ne ver be separate any more. For Babylon the Beautiful, the Mother of abomina-tions, hath sworn by her holy cteis, whereof every poi nt is a pang, that she will not rest from her adulteries until the blood of everything that liveth is gathered therein, and the wine thereof laid up and matured and consecrated, and worthy to gladden the heart of my Father.

And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of the blood of the Lamb being a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they have sealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter th erein. Thus do they shut themselves off from the company of the saints. Thus do they keep themselves from compassion and from under-standing. Accursed are they, for they shut up their blood in their heart. They keep themselves from the kisses of my Mother Babylon, and in their lonely fort resses they pray to the false moon. And they bind themselves t ogether with an oath, and with a great curse. And of their malice they conspire together, and they have power, and mastery, a nd in their cauldrons do they brew the harsh wine of delusion, mingled with the poison of their selfishness. Thus they make war upon the Holy One, sending forth their delusion upon men, and upon everything that liveth.

They have wings upon their helmets and th eir heels: they are clad in complete armour, and the least of their swords is like the breaking forth of a tremendous storm of li ghtning. The least of their spears is like a great water-spout. On their shields are the eyes of Tetragrammaton, winged with flame,ówhite, red, black, yellow and blue. On their flanks are va st squadrons of elephants, and behind them is their meteor-ar tillery. They that sit upon the elephants are armed with the thunderbolt of Zeus.

By three and by three and by th ree hath He made firm the foundation against the earthquake that is three. For in the number nine is the changefulness of th e numbers brought to naught. For with whatsoever number thou wilt cover it, it appeareth unchanged. These things are spoken unto him that understandeth, that is a breastplate unto the elephants, or a corselet unto the angels, or a scale upon the towers of iron; yet is this mighty host set only for a defense, and whoso passeth beyond their lines hath no help in them.

And thou, that art an heap of dry dust in the city of the pyramids, must understand these things. And now a thing happens, which is unfortunately sheer nonsense; for the ∆thyr that is the foundation of the universe was attacked by the Outermost Abyss, and the only way that I can express it is by saying that the universe was shaken. But the universe was not shaken. And that is the exact truth; so that the rational mind which is interpreting these spiritual things is offended; but, being trained to obey, it setteth down that which it doth not understand.

And since he reverenceth the Person of the Seer as his Teacher , let the Seer bind him with a great Oath to do this.

I have shut myself up from the spendthrifts, my gold is safe in my treasure-chamber, and I have made every living thing my concubine, and none shall touch them, save only I. And yet I am scorched, even while I sh iver in the wind. He hateth me and tormenteth me. He would have stolen me from myself, but I shut myself up and mock at him, even while he plagueth me.

(The Frater was seated in a secret place covered completely by a black robe, in the position called the ìThunderbolt.î He did not move or speak during the ceremony.) Next the Scribe was hallucinated, believing that before him was a beautiful courtesan whom prev iously he had loved in Paris.

If thou canst command me by the power of the Most High, know that I did indeed tempt thee, and it repenteth me.

For if thou commandest me to obedience in the Holy name s, I cannot swerve therefrom, for their first whispering is greater than the noise of all my temptests.

(Here Choronzon attempts to seduce the Scribe by appealing to his pride. But the Scribe refused to be tempted, and commanded the demon to continue with the ∆thyr. There was again a short delay.) Choronzon hath no form, because he is the maker of all form; and so rapidly he changeth from one to the other as he may best think fit to seduce those whom he hateth, the servants of the Most High. Thus taketh he the form of a beautiful woman, or of a wise and holy man, or of a serpent that writheth upon the earth ready to sting.

The demon replied:) Thinkest thou, O fool, that ther e is any anger and any pain that I am not, or any hell but this my spirit? Images, images, images, all without control, all without reason. The malice of Choronzon is not the malice of a being; it is the quality of malice, because he that boasteth himself ìI am I,î hath in truth no self, and these are they that are fallen under my power, the slaves of the Blind One that boasted himself to be the Enlightened One. For there is no centre, nay, nothing but Dispersion. Woe, woe, woe, threefold to him that is led away by talk, O talkative One.

By dint of anger and of threatening him w ith the Magick Staff did he accomplish this. He then repaired the circle. The discomfited demon now continued:) All is dispersion. These are the qualities of things. The tenth ∆thyr is the world of adjectives, and there is no substance therein. (Now returneth the beautif ul woman who had before tempted the Scribe.

I would bite off thine ears and nose before I began with thee. I would take thy guts for fiddle-strings at the Black Sabbath.

(Then the demon tried to make the Scribe laugh at Magick, and to think that it was all rubbi sh, that he might deny the names of God that he had invoked to protect him; which, if he had doubted but for an instant, he had leapt upon him, and gnawed through his spine at the neck.

NOTE BY SCRIBE Almost from the beginning of the ceremony was the Scribe overshadowed, and he spoke as it were in spite of himself, remembering afterwards scarcely a word of his speeches, some of which were long and seemingly eloquent. All the time he had a sense of being protected from Choronzon, and this sense of security prevented his knowing fear. Several times did the Scribe threaten to put a curse upon the demon; but ever, before he uttere d the words of the curse, did the demon obey him. For himself, he knoweth not the words of the curse. Also is it meet to record in this place that the Scribe several times whistled in a Magical manner, which never before had he attempted, and the demon was apparently much discomforted thereat. Now knoweth the Scribe that he was wrong in holding much converse with the demon; for Choronzon, in the confusion and chaos of his thought, is much terri fied by silence. And by silence can he be brought to obey. For cunningly doth he talk of many things, going from subject to subject, and thus he misleadeth the wary into argument with him. And though Choronzon be easily beaten in argument, yet, by disturbing the attention of him who would command him, doth he gain the victory. For Choronzon feareth of all things concentration and silence: he therefore who w ould command him should will in silence: thus is he brought to obey.

And from the key-hole issue flames, blue and green and violet , but without any touch of yellow or red in them. It seems as if there were a wind beyond the door, that is blowing the flame out. And a voice comes: ìWho is he that hath the key to the gate of the evening star?î"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 96 And now an Angel cometh a nd seeketh to open the door by trying many keys. And they are none of any avail. And the same voice saith: ìThe five and the six are balanced in the word Abrahadabra, and therein is the mystery disclosed. But the key unto this gate is the balance of th e seven and the four; and of this thou hast not even the first letter. Now there is a word of four letters that containeth in itself all the mystery of the Tetragrammaton, and there is a word of seven letters which it concealeth, and that again concealet h the holy word that is the key of the abyss.* And this thou shalt find, revolving it in thy mind. Hide therefore thine eyes. And I will set my key in the lock, and open it. Yet still let thine ey es be hidden, for thou canst not bear the glory that is within. So, therefore, I covered mine eyes with my hands. Yet through my hands could I perceive a little of those bowers of azure flame. And a voice said: It is kindled into fire that was the blue breast of ocean; because this is th e bar of heaven, and the feet of the Most High are set thereon. Now I behold more fully: Each t ongue of flame, each leaf of flame, each flower of flame, is one of the great love-stories of the world, with all its retinue of mise-en-scène . And now there is a most marvelous rose formed from the flame, and a perpetual rain of lilies and passion-flowers and violets. And there is gathered out of it all, yet identical with it, the form of a woman like the woman in the Apocalypse, but her beauty and her radiance are such that one cannot look thereon, save with sidelong glances. I enter immediately into trance. It seems that it is she of whom it is written, ìThe fool hath said in hi s heart ëthere is no God.í î But the words are not Ain Elohim, but La (=nay!) and Elohim contracted from 86 to 14 , because La is 31 , which × 14 is 434 , Daleth, Lamed, Tau.

It is impossible to describe how this vision changeth from glory unto glory, for at each glan ce the vision is changed. And this is because she transmitteth the Word to the Understanding, and therefore hath she many form s, and each goddess of love is but a letter of the alphabet of love. Now, there is a mystery in the word Logos, that containeth the three letters whose analogy ha th been shown in the lower heavens, Samech, and Lamed, and Gimel, that are 93 , which is thrice 31 , and in them are set the two eyes of Horus. (Ayin means an eye.) For, if it were not so, the arrow could not pierce the rainbow, and there could be no poise in the balance, and the Great Book should never be unsealed. But this is she that poureth the Water of Life upon her head, wh ence it floweth to fructify the earth. But now the whole ∆thyr is the most brilliant peacock blue. It is the Universal Peacock that I behold. And there is a voice: Is not this bird the bird of Juno, that is an hundred, and thirty, and six? And therefore is she the mate of Jupiter.* And now the peacock's head is again changed into a womanís head sparkling and coruscating with its own light of gems. But I look upwards, seeing that sh e is called the footstool of the Holy One, even as Binah is called His throne. And the whole ∆thyr is full of the most wonderful bands of light,óa thousand different curves and whorls, even as it was before, when I spake mysteries of the Holy Qabalah, and so could not describe it. Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormous deserts studded with great rocks; and I see little lonely souls, running helplessly about, minute black creat ures like men. And they keep up a very curious howling, that I can compare to nothing that I have ever heard; yet it is strangely human. And the voice says: These are th ey that grasped love and clung thereto, praying ever at th e knees of the great goddess. * The fourth of the mystic numbers of Jupiter is 136 ."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 98 These are they that have shut themselves up in fortresses of Love. Each plume of the peacock is full of eyes, that are at the same time 4 × 7 . And for this is the number 28 reflected down into Netzach; and that 28 is Kaph Cheth (Kach), power. For she is Sakti, the eternal energy of the Concealed One. And it is her eternal energy that hath made this eternal change. And this explaineth the call of the ∆thyrs, the curse that was pronounced in the beginning being but the creati on of Sakti. And this mystery is reflected in the legend of th e Creation, where Adam represents the Concealed One, for Adam is Temurah of MAD, the Enochian word for God, and Eve, whom he created for love, is tempted by the snake, Nechesh, who is Messiah her child. And the snake is the magical power, which hath destroyed the primordial equilibrium. And the garden is the supernal Eden, where is Ayin, 70 , the Eye of the Concealed One, and the creative Lingam; and Daleth, love; and Nun the serpent. And therefore this constitution was implicitly in the nature of Eden ( cf . Liber L., I., 29, 30 ), so that the call of the ∆thyrs could not have been any other call than that which it is. But they that are without understanding have interpreted all this askew, because of the Myster y of the Abyss, for there is no Path from Binah unto Chesed; a nd therefore the course of the Flaming Sword was no more a current, but a spark.

And the ashes thereof were dispersed throughout the whole of the 10 th ∆thyr. And for this, all knowledge is piecemeal, and it is of no value unless it be co-ordinated by Understanding.

Now again I see those wanderi ng souls, that have sought restricted love, and have not understood that ìthe word of sin is restriction.î It is very curious; they seem to be looking for one another or for something, all the time, consta ntly hurrying about. But they knock up against one another and yet will not see one another, or cannot see one another, because they are so shut up in their cloaks. And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut himself up and made hims elf fast against the universe. For they that sit encamped upon the sea in the city of the Pyramids are indeed shut up. But they have given their blood, even to the last drop, to fill the cup of BABALON. These that thou seest are indeed the Black Brothers, for it is written: ìHe shall laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh.î And therefore hath he exalted them unto the plane of love. And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his wickedness. Now, if one of these were to cast o ff his cloak he should behold the brilliance of the lady of the ∆thyr; but they will not. And yet again there is another cause wherefore He hath permitted them to enter thus far w ithin the frontiers of Eden, so that His thought should never swerve from compassion. But do thou behold the brilliance of Love, that casteth forth seven stars upon thine head from her right hand, and crowneth thee with a crown of seven roses. Behold!

And therefore was he a fool who uttered her name in his heart, for the root of evil is th e root of breath, and the speech in the silence was a lie. Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not. But from above he rejoiceth, for the joy of dissolution is ten thousand, and the pang of birth but a little. And now thou shalt go forth from the ∆thyr, for the voice of the ∆thyr is hidden and concealed from thee because thou hadst not the key of the door thereof, and thine eyes were not able to bear the splendour of the vision. But thou shalt meditate upon the mysteries thereof, and upon the la dy of the ∆thyr; and it may be by the wisdom of the Most High th at the true voice of the ∆thyr, that is continual song, may be heard of thee.

These symbols are f ound both in the name of AvÈ and in the name of the ∆thyr. Thus he is neither Horus nor Osiris.

These images are th e illusions made by the Ape of"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 101 Thoth. And this I understand, that I am not worthy to receive the mysteries of this ∆thyr. And all this which I have seen (being all the thoughts that I have ever thought) is, as it were, a guardian of the ∆thyr. I seem quite helpless. I am trying all sorts of magical methods of piercing the veil: and the more I strive, the farther away I seem to get from success. But a voice comes now: Must not understanding lie open unto wisdom as the pyramids lie open to the stars? Accordingly, I wait in a certain magical posture which it is not fitting to disclose, and above me appears the starry heaven of night, and one star greater than all the other stars. It is a star of eight rays. I recognize it as the star in the seventeenth key of the Tarot, as the Star of Mercury. A nd the light of it cometh from the path of Aleph. And the letter Cheth is also involved in the interpretation of this star, and the paths of hÈ and vau are the separations which this Star unites. And in the heart of the star is an exceeding splendour, óa god standing upon the moon, brilliant beyond imagining. It is like unto the vision of the Universal Mercury. But this is the Fixed Mercury, and hÈ and vau are the perfected sulphur and salt. But now I come into the centre of the maze, and whirling dus t of stars and great forgotten gods. It is the whirling Svastika wh ich throws off all these things, for the Svastika is in aleph by its shape and number, and in beth by the position of the arms of the Magician, and in gimel because of the sign of the Mourning of Isis, and thus is the Crown defended by these three thunderbolts. Is not thrice seventeen fifty- one, that is, failure and pain? Now I am shut out again by this black Svastika with a corona of fire about it. And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the Most High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the adepts. A nd BABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she hath fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called her children together, saying: Come up with"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 102 me, and let us make a mock of the nakedness of the Most High. And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking backwards; and was white. And the second of the adepts covered His shame with a clot h, walking sideways and was yellow. And the third of the adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walking forwards; and was black. And these are three great schools of the Magi, who ar e also the three Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not wisdom, thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if the three schools be not one. For the Black Brothers lift not up their heads thus far into the Holy Chokmah, for they were all drowned in the great flood, which is Binah, before the true vine could be planted upon the holy hill of Zion. Now again I stand in the centre, and all things whirl by with incessant fury. And the thought of the god entereth my mind, and I cry aloud: Behold, the volatile is become fixed; and in the heart of eternal motion is eternal rest. So is the Peace beneath the sea that rageth with her storms; so is the changeful moon, the dead planet that revolveth no more. So the far-seeing, the far-darting hawk is poised passionless in the blue ; so also the ibis that is long of limb meditateth solitary in th e sign of Sulphur. Behold, I stand ever before the Eternal One in the sign of the Enterer. And by virtue of my speech is he wrappe d about in silence, and he is wrapped in mystery by me, who am the Unveiler of the Mysteries. And although I be truth, yet do they call me rightly the God of Lies, for speech is two-fold, and tr uth is one.

But thou that art with me in th e spirit-vision art not with me by right of Attainment, and thou canst not stay in this place to behold how I run and return, and who are the flies that are caught in my web.

For I stand on every path, and turn them aside from the truth by my words, and by my magick arts. And this is the horror that wa s shown by the lake that was nigh unto the City of the Seven Hills, and this is the Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto mankind. Moses, and Buddha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus, and Osiris, and Mohammed; for all these attained unto the grade of Magus, and therefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians of the truth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such as understood; for the truth may not pass the Gate of the Abyss. But the reflection of the truth hath been shown in the lower Sephiroth. And its balance is in Beauty, and therefore have they who sought only beauty come nearest to the truth. For the beauty receiveth directly three rays from the supernals, and the others no more than one. So, therefore, th ey that have sought after majesty and power and victory and lear ning and happiness and gold, have been discomfited. And these sayings are the lights of wisdom that thou mayst know thy Master, for he is a Magus. And because thou didst eat of the Pomegranate in hell, for half the year art thou concealed, and half the year revealed. Now I perceive the Temple that is the heart of this ∆thyr; it is an Urn suspended in the air, without support, above the centre of a well. And the well hath eight pillars, and a canopy above it, and without there is a circle of marble paving-stones, and without them a great outer circle of pilla rs. And beyond there is the forest of the stars. But the Urn is the wonderful thing in all this; it is made of fixed Mercury; and with in it are the ashes of the Book Tarot, which hath been utterly consumed. And this is that mystery which is spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles; that Jupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chokmah) visited (that is, inspired), Ephesus, th e City of Diana, Binahówas not Diana a black stone?óand they burnt their books of magick."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 104 Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is the fire that hath burnt up the book Tarot. For in the book Tarot was preserved all of the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Book of Thoth), of the ∆on that is passed. And in the Book of Enoch was first given the wisdom of the New ∆on. And it was hidden for three hundred y ears, because it was wrested untimely from the Tree of Life by the hand of a desperate magician. For it was the Master of that Magician who overthrew the power of the Christian chur ch; but the pupil rebelled against the master, for he foresaw that the New ( i.e. , the Protestant) would be worse than the Old. But he understood not the purpose of his Master, and that was, to prepare the way for the overthrowing of the ∆on. There is a writing upon the Urn of which I can but read the (two) words: Stabat Crux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem. And there is writing in Greek above that. The word ënoxí written in Greek, and a circle with a cross in the centre of it, a St. Andrew's cross. Then above that is a sigil(?), hidden by a hand. And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who shall make the phoenix-wand? Not even he who by his understanding hath made the lotus-wand to grow in the Great Sea. Get thee back, for thou art not an Atheist, and though thou have violated thy mother, thou hast not slain thy father. Get thee back from the Urn; thy ashes are not hidden here. Then again arose the God Thoth, in the sign of the Enterer, and he drove the seer from befo re his face. And he fell through the starry night unto the little village in the desert.

And there is a voice: thou know est not how the Seven was united with the Four; much less then canst thou understand the marriage of the Eight and the Three. Yet there is a word wherein these are made one, and therein is contained the Mystery that thou seekest, concerning the rending asunder of the veil of my Mother. Now there is an avenue of pylons (not one alone), steep after steep, carved from the solid rock of the mountain; and that rock is a substance harder than diamond, and brighter than light, and heavier than lead. In each pylon is seated a god. There seems an endless series of these pylons. A nd all the gods of all the nations of the earth are shown, for there are many avenues, all leading to the top of the mountain. Now I come to the top of th e mountain, and the last pylon opens into a circular hall, with ot her pylons leading out of it, each of which is the last pylon of a great avenue; there seem to be nine such pylons. And in the centre is a shrine, a circular table, supported by marble figures of men and women, alternate white and black; they face inwards, and their buttocks are almost worn away by the kisses of those who have come to worship that supreme God, who is the single end of all these diverse religions. But the shrine itself is higher than a man may reach. But the Angel that was with me lifted me, and I saw that the edge of the altar, as I must call it, was surrounded by holy men. Each has in his right hand a weaponóone a sword, one a spear, one a thunderbolt, and so on, but each with his left hand gives the sign of silence. I wish to see wh at is within their ring. One of them bends forward so that I may whisper the pass-word. The Angel prompts me to whisper: ìThere is no god.î So they let me pass, and though there was indeed nothing visible therein, yet there was a very strange atmosphere, which I could not understand. Suspended in the air there is a silver star, and on the forehead of each of the guardians there is a silver star. It is a pentagram,ó"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 106 because, says the Angel, three a nd five are eight; three and eight are eleven. (There is another num erical reason that I cannot hear.) And as I entered their ring, they bade me stand in their circle, and a weapon was given unto me. And the pass-word that I had given seems to have been whispe red round from one to the other, for each one nods gravely as if in solemn acquiescence, until the last one whispers the same words in my ears. But they have a different sense. I had taken them to be a denial of the existence of God, but the man who says them to me evidently means nothing of the sort: What he does mean I cannot tell at all. He slightly emphasized the word ìthere.î And now all is suddenly blotte d out, and instead appears the Angel of the ∆thyr. He is all in black, burnished black scales, just edged with gold. He has va st wings, with terrible claws on the ends, and he has a fierce f ace, like a dragon's, and dreadful eyes that pierce one through and through. And he says: O thou that art so dull of understanding, when wilt thou begin to annihilate thyself in the mysteries of the ∆thyrs? For all that thou thinkest is but thy thought; and as there is no god in the ultimate shrine, so there is no I in thine own Cosmos. They that have said this are of them that understood. And all men have misinterpreted it, even as thou didst misinterpret it. He says some more: I cannot catch it properly, but it seems to be to the effect that the true God is equally in all the shrines, and the true I in all the parts of the body and the soul. He speaks with such a terrible roaring that it is impossible to hear the words; one catches a a phrase here and there, or a glimpse of the idea. With every word he belches forth sm oke, so that the whole ∆thyr becomes full of it. And now I hear the Angel: Ever y particle of matter that forms the smoke of my breath is a religion that hath flourished among the inhabitants of the worlds .

And he"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 107 says: Know thou that all the religions of all the worlds end herein, but they are only the smoke of my breath, and I am only the head of the Great Dragon that eateth up the Universe; w ithout whom the Fifth ∆thyr would be perfect, even as the first. Yet unless he pass by me, can no man come unto the perfections. And the rule is ended that hath bound thee, and this shall be thy rule: that thou shalt purify t hyself, and anoint thyself with perfume; and thou shalt be in the sunlight, the day being free from clouds. And thou shalt make the Call of the ∆thyr in silence. Now, then, behold how the head of the dragon is but the tail of the ∆thyr! Many are they th at have fought their way from mansion to mansion of the Ever lasting House, and beholding me at last have returned, declari ng, ìFearful is the aspect of the Mighty and Terrible One.î Happy are they that have known me for whom I am. And glory unto hi m that hath made a gallery of my throat for his arrow of truth, and the moon for his purity. The moon waneth. The moon wa neth. The moon waneth. For in that arrow is the Light of Truth that overmastereth the light of the sun, whereby she shines. The arrow is fledged with the plumes of Maat, that are the pl umes of Amoun, and the shaft is the phallus of Amoun, the Concealed One. And the barb thereof is the star that thou sawest in the place where was No God. And of them that guarded the star, there was not found one worthy to wield the Arrow. And of them that worshipped there was not found one worthy to behold th e Arrow.

Yet do thou distinguish between the upward and the downward Arrows, for the upward arro w is straitened in its flight, and it is shot by a firm hand, fo r Jesod is Jod Tetragrammaton, and Jod is a hand, but the downwar d arrow is shot by the topmost point of the Jod; and that Jod is the Hermit, and it is the minute"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"L IBER CDXVIII 108 point that is not extended, that is nigh unto the heart of Hadit.

December 12, 1909, 7-8.12 p.m. Now then art thou approached unto an august Arcanum; verily thou art come unto the ancient Marvel, the winged light, the Fountains of Fire, the Mystery of the Wedge. But it is not I that can reveal it, for I have never b een permitted to behold it, who am but the watcher upon the threshold of the ∆thyr. My message is spoken, and my mission is accomplished. And I withdraw myself, covering my face with my wings, before the presence of the Angel of the ∆thyr. So the Angel departed with bowed head, folding his wings across. And there is a little child in a mist of blue light; he hath golden hair, a mass of curls, and d eep blue eyes. Yea, he is all golden, with a living, vivid gold.

But thou who hast adored her without fear, who hast made thy life an initiation into her My stery, thou that hast neither mother nor father, nor sister nor brother, nor wife nor child, who hast made thyself lonely as the herm it crab that is in the waters of the Great Sea, behold! when the sistrons are shaken, and the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"T HE V ISION AND THE V OICE 109 trumpets blare forth the glory of Isis, at the end thereof there is silence, and thou shalt commune with Nephthys.

Take then the bow and th e quiver from my shoulders and slay me; for unless thou slay me, thou shalt not unveil the Mystery of the ∆thyr. Therefore I did as he commande d; in the quiver were two arrows, one white, one black. I cannot force myself to fit an arrow to the bow. And there came a voice: It must needs be. And I said: No man can do this thing. And the voice answered, as it were an echo: Nemo hoc facere potest . Then came understanding to me, and I took forth the Arrows. The white arrow had no barb, but the black arrow was barbed like a forest of fish-hooks; it was bound round with brass, and it had been dipped in deadly poison. Then I fitted the white arrow to the string, and I shot it against the heart of Eros, and though I shot with all my force, it fell harmlessly from his side. But at that moment the black arrow was thrust through mine own heart. I am filled with fearful agony. And the child smiles, and sa ys: Although thy shaft hath pierced me not, although the envenomed barb hath struck thee through, yet I am slain, and thou livest and triumphest, for I am thou and thou art I. With that he disappears, and the ∆thyr splits with a roar as of ten thousand thunders. And behold, The Arrow! The plumes of Maat are its crown, set about the disk. It is the Ateph crown of Thoth, and there is the shaft of burning light, and beneath there is a silver wedge.

For that silver wedge is like a lotus flower, and the Eye within the Ateph Crown crieth: I watch. And the Shaft crieth: I work. And the Barb crieth: I wait. And the Voice of the ∆thyr echoeth: It beams. It burns. It blooms. And now there cometh a strange thought; this Arrow is the source of all motion; it is infinite motion, yet it moveth not, so that there is no motion. And therefore th ere is no matter. This Arrow is the glance of the Eye of Shiva. But because it moveth not, the universe is not destroyed. The universe is put forth and swallowed up in the quivering of the plumes of Maat, that are the plumes of the Arrow; but those plumes quiver not. And a voice comes: That which is above is not like that which is below. And another voice answers it: That which is below is not like that which is bove. And a third voice answers these tw o: What is above and what is below? For there is the di vision that divideth not, and the multiplication that multiplieth not. And the One is the many. Behold, this Mystery is be yond understanding, for the winged globe is the crown, and the shaft is the wisdom, and the barb is the understanding. And the Arrow is one, and thou art lost in the Mystery, who art but as a babe that is carried in the womb of its mother, that art not yet ready for the light. And the vision overcometh me. My sense is stunned; my sight is blasted; my hearing is dulled. And a voice cometh: Thou didst seek the remedy of sorrow; therefore all sorrow is thy portion. This is that which is written: ìGod hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.î For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart.

But they send forth a wind that is a cl oud of Angels, and they beat the water with their feet, and little waves splash upóthey are memories. For the seer hath no head; it is expanded into the universe, a vast and silent sea, crowned with the stars of night. Yet in the very midst thereof is th e arrow.

I prayed unto the Lords of Vision, saying: O my Lords, take not away this wonder from my sight. And they said: It must needs be.

And also there is an Assyrian legend of a woman with a fish, and also there is a legend of Eve a nd the Serpent, for Cain was the child of Eve and the Serpent, and not of Eve and Adam; and therefore when he had slain hi s brother, who was the first murderer, having sacrificed living things to his demon, had Cain the mark upon his brow, which is th e mark of the Beast spoken of in the Apocalypse, and is the sign of initiation. The shedding of blood is necessa ry, for God did not hear the children of Eve until blood was sh ed. And that is external religion; but Cain spake not w ith God, nor had the mark of initiation upon his brow, so that he was shunned by all men, until he had shed blood.

They joined different fables together to try and make a connected story, and they sophisticated them to suit their social and political conditions.

All I can say is, that ther e is a sort of dew, like mist, upon the Stone, and yet it has become hot to the touch. All I get is that the Apocalyps e was the recension of a dozen or so totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down to make them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but mi racles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which only suited pedants. So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated the style of John. And this explains why the end of the world does not happen every few years, as advertised. There is nothing whatever in the Stone but a White Rose. And a voice comes: there shall be no more red roses, for she hath crushed all the blood of all things into her cup. It seemed at one time as if th e rose was in the breast of a beautiful woman, high-bosomed, tall, stately, yet who danced like a snake. But there was no subsistence in this vision.

A voice comes: When thy dust shall strew the earth whereon She walketh, then mayest thou bear the impress of Her foot. And thou thinkest to behold Her face! The Stone is become of the mo st brilliant whiteness, and yet, in that whiteness, all the other col ours are implicit. The colour of anything is but its dullness, its obstr uctiveness. So is it with these visions. All that they are is falsity. Every idea merely marks where the mind of the Seer was too stupid to receive the light, and therefore reflected it. Therefore, as the pure light is colourless, so is the pure soul black. And this is the Mystery of the incest of CHAOS with his daughter. There is nothing whatever visible. But I asked of the Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been duly performed. And he says: Yes, the ∆thyr is present. It is thou that canst not perceive it, even as I cannot perceive it, because it is so entirely beyond thy conception that there is nothing in thy mind on to which it can cast a symbol, even as the emptiness of space is not h eated by the fire of the sun. And so pure is the light that it preventeth the formation of images, and therefore have men called it darkne ss. For with any lesser light, the mind responds, and makes for itself divers palaces. It is that which is written: ìIn my Father's house there are many mansionsî; and if the house be destroyed, how much more the mansions that are therein!

Thus is she the synthesis of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 , which being added are 10 , therefore could she set her daughter upon her own throne, and defile her own bed with her virginity.
