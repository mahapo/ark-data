Whence magicians are profound a nd di ligent searchers into Nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shal l seem to be a miracle.\" \" The Goetia of the Lemegeton of King S olomon.\" \"Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pur e una dulterated form, it is assum ed that in na ture one event follows another necessarily and invariably without the intervention of any s piritual or personal agency. Thus its funda mental conception is identical with that of modern science; un derlying the whole system is a faith, implicit but real and f irm, in the order and uni formity of nature. The magician doe s not doubt that the same causes wil l always produc e the same effects, that the performance of the proper ceremony accompanied by t he appropriate spell, will inevitably be attended by t he desire d results, unl ess, indeed, hi s incantations shoul d chance to be thwarted and f o iled by t he more potent charms of another sorcerer. He suppl icates no hi gher p ower: he sues the favour of no f ickle and w ayward be ing: he abases himself befo re no a wful deity. Yet his pow er, great as he believes it to be , is by no m ean s arbitrary and unl imited. H e can wield it only so long a s he strictly conform s to the rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws of nature as conce ived by {I X} him. To ne glect these rules, to br eak these laws in the smallest particular is to incur failure, and m ay even expos e the uns kilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril. If he claims a sovereignty ove r nature, it is a c onstitutional sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and e xercised in exac t conformity with ancient usage. Thus the analogy be tween the magical and the scientific conceptions of the world is close. In bot h of them the succession o f events is perfectly regular and c ertain, be ing de termined by i mmutable laws, the ope ration of which can be foreseen and c alculated pr ecisely; the elements o f caprice, of chance, and of accident are banished from the course of nature. Both of them ope n up a seemingly boundl ess vista of pos sibilities to him who kn ows the causes of things and c an touch the secret springs that set in motion th e vast and intricate mechanism of the world. H ence the strong a ttraction w hich magic and s cience alike have exercised on t he hum an mind; hence the pow erful s timulus that both ha ve given to the pur suit of know ledge. They lure the weary enqui rer, the footsore seeker, on t hrough t he wilderness of disappoi ntment in t he present by t heir endless promises of the future: they take him up t o he top of an exceeding hi gh m ount ain and s hew him, beyond t he dark clouds and r olling mists at his feet, a vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be , but radi ant with une arthly splendour , bathed in the light of dreams.\" Dr. J.

M y former work ha s been misunde rstood, a nd its scope limited, by m y us e of t echnical terms. It has attracted onl y too m any di lettanti and e ccentrics, weak lings seeking in \"Magic\" an escape from reality. I myself was first consciousl y dr awn to the subject in this way. And it has repelled onl y too m any s cientif ic and pr actical minds, such as I most designed to influence. But  M AGICK is for  ALL. I have written this book t o he lp the Banker, the Pugilist, the Biologist, th e Poet, the Navvy, the Grocer, the Factory Girl, the Mathematician, the Stenogr apher, the Golfer, the Wife, the Consul --- and a ll the rest --- to fulfil them selves perfectly, each in his or her own pr oper function. Let me explain in a few words how it came about that I blazoned the word  M AGICK upon t he Banner that I have bor ne before me all my life. Before I touched my teens, I was already a ware that I was THE BEAST whose nu mber is 666. I did not unde rstand in the least {XI} what that implied; it was a passionately ecstatic sense of identity. In my third ye ar at Cambridge, I devoted myself consciously to the Great Wor k, unde rstanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being, f ree from the constraints, accidents, and de ceptions of material existence. I found m yself at a loss for a name to de signate my work, just as H. P. Blav atsky s ome years earlier. \"Theosophy\" , \"Spiritualism\", \"Occultism\", \"Mysticism\" , all invol ved unde sirable connot ations. I chose therefore the name.  \" MAGICK\" as essentially the most sublime, and a ctually the most discredited, of all the available terms. I swore to rehabilitate 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"  M AGICK to identify it with my ow n career; and to compel mankind to respect, love, and trust that which they scorned, ha ted and f eared. I have kept my Word. But the time is now come for me to carry my ba nner into the thick of the pre ss of hum an life. I must make  M AGICK the essential factor in the life of  ALL. In pr esenting this book t o the world, I must then explain and justify my pos ition by f ormulating a definition of  M AGICK and s etting f orth its main pr inciples in such a way that  ALL may unde rstand instantly that their souls, their lives, in every relation w ith every other hum an be ing a nd e very circumstance, depend upon  M AGICK and the right comprehension a nd r ight application thereof. I. \"DEFINITION.\"  M AGICK is the Science and Art of causing C hange to oc cur in conformity with Will. {XII} (Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my know ledge. I therefore take \"magical weapons \", pen, ink, a nd pa per; I write \"i ncantations\" --- these sentences --- in the \"magical langua ge\" i.e. that which is unde rstood by t he people I wish to instruct; I call forth \"spirits\", such as printers, publ ishers, books ellers, and s o forth, and c onstrain them to conve y my message to those people. The composition a nd di stribution of this book i s t hus an act of  M AGICK by w hich I cause changes to take place in conformity with my Will>) II. \"POSTULATE.\" ANY required Change may be effected by t he application of the proper kind a n d de gree of force in the proper manner through t he proper medium to the proper object. (Illustration: I wish to pr epare an ounc e of Chloride of Gold. I must take the right kind of acid, ni tro-hydr ochloric and no ot her, in sufficient qua ntity and of adequate strength, and pl ace it, in a vessel which will not break, leak , or corrode, in such a manner as will not produc e unde sirable results, with th e necessary qua ntity of Gold: and s o forth. E very Change has its own condi tion s. In the present state of our know ledge and pow er some changes are not pos sibl e in pr actice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into t in, or create men from mushroom s. But it is theoretically pos sible to cause in any obj ect any c hange of which that object is capable by na ture; and the condi tions are covered by t he above pos tulate.) III. \"THEOREMS.\" (1) Every intentional act is a Magical Act.> (Illustration: See \"Definition\" above .) {X III} (2) Every successful act has conformed to the pos tulate. (3) Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the pos tulate have not been fulfilled. 7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" (Illustrations: There may be failure to unde rstand the case; as when a doc tor makes a wrong di agnos is, and hi s treatment injures his patient. There may be f ailure to apply the right kind of force, as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light. There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, as wh en a wrestler has his hold br oken. There may be failure to apply the force in the right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong w indow of the Bank . There may be failure to employ the correct medium, as when Leonardo da Vinci found hi s masterpiece fade away. The force may be applied to an uns uitable ob ject, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut.) (4) The first requisite for causing a ny c hange is through qua litative and qu antitative unde rstanding of the condi tions. (Illustration: The most common c ause of failure in life is ignor ance of one ' s own True Will, or of the means by w hich to fulfil that Will. A man may fancy himself a painter, and w aste his life trying to be come one ; or he may be reall y a painter, and ye t fail to unde rstand a nd to measure the difficulties peculia r to that career.) (5) The second r equisite of causing a ny c hange is the practical ability to s et in right motion the necessary forces. (Illustration: A banker may ha ve a perfect grasp of a given situation, ye t l ack the qua lity of decision, or the assets, necessary to take advantage of it.) (6) \"Every man and e very woman is a star.\" That is to say, every hum an be in g is intrinsically an independent individual with his own pr oper character and proper motion. (7) Every man and e very woman ha s a course, depending pa rtly on t he self, and partly on t he environm ent which is natural and ne cessary for each. Anyone who is forced from his own course, either through not unde rstanding hi mself, or thr ough e xternal oppos ition, c omes into conflict with the order of the Universe, a nd s uffers accordingly. {X IV} (Illustration: A man may think it his duty to act in a certain way, through having m ade a fancy picture of himself, instead of investigating hi s actual nat ure. For example, a woman may make herself miserable for life by t hinking that she prefers love to social consideration, or \"vice versa\". One woman may stay with an uns ympathetic hus band w hen she would really be happy i n an attic with a lover, while another may fool herself into a romantic elopement when he r only true pleasures are those of presiding a t fashionable functions. Again, a boy' s instinct may tell him to go t o sea, while his parents insists on hi s becoming a doc tor. In such a case, he will be both uns uccessful and unha ppy i n medicin e.) (8) A Man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting hi s strength. H e cannot hope to influence his environm ent efficiently. (Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, i t is in no c ondi tion to un dertake the invasion of other count ries. A man with cancer employs his nour ish ment alike to his own us e and to that of the enemy which is part of himself. H e soon f ails to resist the pressure of his environm ent. In pr actical life, a m an who is doing w hat his conscience tells him to be wrong w ill do i t very clums ily. At first!) (9) A man who is doing this True Will has the inertia of the Universe to ass ist him. (Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that the indiv idual shoul d be true to his own na ture, and a t the same time adapt himself to h is environm ent.) (10) Nature is a continuous phe nom enon, t hough w e do not know in all cases h ow things are conne cted. (Illustration: Human consciousness depends on t he properties of protoplasm, the existence of which de pends on i nnum erable phys ical condi tions peculiar to t his planet; and this planet is determined by t he mechanical balance of the whol e universe of matter. We may then say that our consciousness is causally conne cted with the remotest galaxies; yet we do not know even how it arises from --- or with --- the molecular changes in the brain.) (11) Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by t he 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"empirical application of certain {X V} pr inciples whose interplay invol ves diffe rent orders of idea conne cted with each other in a way be yond our present compr ehension. (Illustration: We are able to light cities by r ule-of-thum b methods . We do not know what consciousness is, or how it is conne cted with muscular action; wh at electricity is or how it is conne cted with the machines that generate it; an d our methods depend on c alculations invol ving m athematical ideas which ha ve no corresponde nce in the Universe as we know it.>) (12) Man is ignor ant of the nature of his own be ing a nd pow ers. Even his id ea of his limitations is based on e xperience of the past, and e very step in his progress extends his empire. There is therefore no r eason to assign theoretic al limits> to what he may be , or to what he may do. (Illustration: A generation a go it was suppos ed theoretically impossible tha t man shoul d ever know the chemical composition of the fixed stars. It is know n that our senses are adapted to receive only an infinitesimal fraction of the possible rates of vibration. M odern instruments have enabled us to de tect some of these suprasensibles by i ndirect methods , and e ven to us e their peculiar qu alities in the service of man, as in the case of the rays of Hertz and R ontgen. As Tynda ll said, m an might at any m oment learn to pe rceive and ut ilise vibrat ions of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds. The que stion of Magick is a q uestion of discovering a nd e mploying hi therto unknow n forces in na ture. We kno w that they exist, and w e cannot doubt the pos sibility of mental or phys ical in struments capable of bringing us into relation w ith them.) (13) Every man is more or less aware that his individuality comprises sever al orders of existence, even when he maintains that his subtler principles are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle. A similar order may be assumed to extend throughout nature. (Illustration: One doe s not confuse the pain of toothache with {X VI} the dec ay which causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain phys ical forces , such as electrical and thermal conduc tivity; but neither in us nor in them -- - so far as we know --- is there any di rect conscious perception of these force s. Imperceptible influences are therefore associated with all material phe nom e na; and there is no r eason w hy w e shoul d not work upon m atter through t hose sub tle energies as we do t hrough t heir material bases. In fact, we use magnetic f orce to move iron, a nd s olar radiation to reproduc e images.) (14) Man is capable of being, a nd us ing, a nything w hich he perceives, for ev erything that he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being. H e may t hus subjugate the whole Universe of which he is conscious to his individual Wil l. (Illustration: Man ha s used the idea of God to dictate his personal conduc t, to obt ain pow er ove r his fellow, to excuse his crimes, and f or innum erable oth er pur poses, including that of realizing hi mself as God. H e has used the irrat ional and unr eal conceptions of mathematics to he lp him in the construction of mechanical devices. He has used his moral force to influence the actions even of wild animals. He has employed poe tic genius for political pur poses.) (15) Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into any ot her kind of force by us ing s uitable means. There is thus an inexhaustible supp ly of any pa rticular kind of force that we may ne ed. (Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and pow er by us ing it to d rive dyna mos. The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by s o or dering them in speech as to inflame war-like passions. The hallucinations conne cted with the mysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species.) (16) The application of any gi ven force affects all the orders of being w hic h exist in the object to which it is applied, w hichever of those orders is dire ctly affected. (Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not his bod y onl y, is affected by m y act; although t he dagger, as such, ha s no di rect rela tion therewith. S imilarly, the pow er of {XVII} my thought may so work on t he m ind of another person a s to pr oduc e far-reaching phys ical changes in him, or in others through hi m.) 9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" (17) A man may learn to us e any f orce so as to serve any pur pose, by t aking advantage of the above theorems. (Illustration: A man may us e a razor to make himself vigilant ove r his speec h, but using it to cut himself whenever he ungua rdedly utters a chosen word. H e may serve the same pur pose by r esolving that every incident of his life shall remind hi m of a particular thing, m aking e very impression the starting poi nt o f a conne cted series of thought s ending in that thing. H e might also de vote hi s whole energies to some one particular object, by r esolving to do not hing a t v ariance therewith, and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.) (18) He may attract to himself any f orce of the Universe by m aking hi mself a fit receptacle for it, establishing a conne ction w ith it, and a rranging c ondi t ions so that its nature compels it to flow toward him. (Illustration: If I want pur e water to dr ink, I dig a well in a place where there is unde rground w ater; I prevent it from leaking a way; and I arrange to ta ke advantage of water's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.) (19) Man's sense of himself as separate from, and oppos e to, the Universe is a bar to his conduc ting its currents. It insulates him. (Illustration: A popul ar leader is most successful when he forgets himself, and r emembers only \"The Cause\". Self-seeking e ngenders jealousies and s chism. When the organs of the body a ssert their presence otherwise than by s ilent sat isfaction, i t is a sign that they are diseased. The single exception is the or gan of reproduc tion. Yet even in this case its self-assertion be ars witness to its dissatisfaction w ith itself, since it cannot fulfil its function unt il com pleted by i ts count erpart in another organism. (20) Man can onl y attract and e mploy the forces for which he is really fitte d. (Illustration: You c annot make a silk pur se out of a sow's ear. A {XVIII} tr ue man of science learns from every phe nom enon. B ut Nature is dum b to the hypo crite; for in he r there is nothing f alse.>) (21) There is no l imit to the extent of the relations of any m an with the Un iverse in essence; for as soon a s man makes himself one with any idea the means of measurement cease to exist. But his pow er to utilize that force is limited by hi s mental pow er and c apacity, and by t he circumstances of his hum an enviro nment. (Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world be comes, to him, no thing but love boundl ess and immanent; but his mystical state is not contagious ; his fellow-men are either amused or annoye d. H e can onl y extend to others th e effect which his love has had upon hi mself by m eans of his mental and phys ica l qua lities. Thus, Catullus, Dante and S winbur n made their love a mighty mover of mankind by vi rtue of their pow er to put their thought s on t he subject in mu sical and e loque nt langua ge. Again, C leopatra and ot her people in authority mo ulded the fortunes of many ot her people by a llowing love to influence their pol itical actions.

(23) Magick is the Science of unde rstanding one self and one 's condi tions. I t is the Art of applying that unde rstanding in action. (Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a special ball in a special w 10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ay in special circumstances.

(Illustration: To insist that any one else shall comply with one 's own stand ards is to out rage, not only him, but one self, since both pa rties are equally b orn of necessity.) (25) Every man must do M agick each time that he acts or even thinks, since a t hought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action, t hought it may not do s o at the time. (Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man's own body a nd in the air around hi m; it disturbs the balance of the entire Universe, and its eff ects continue eternally throughout all space.

A golfer may lose a few yards on hi s drive, a few more with his second a nd third, he may lie on t he green six ba re inches too f ar from the hole; but the net result of these trifling m ishaps is the difference of a whole stroke, and s o pr obably be t ween ha lving a nd losing the hole.)

(27) Every man shoul d make Magick the keynot e of his life. He shoul d learn its laws and live by t hem. (Illustration: The Banker shoul d discover the real meaning of his existence, the real motive which led him to choos e that profession.

He shoul d learn to distingui sh false values from real, and to act not on a ccident al fluctuations but on c onsiderations of essential importance. Such a banker w ill prove himself superior to others; because he will not be an individual limi ted by t ransitory things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and e ternal as gravitation, a s patient and irresistible as the tides. His system wi ll not be subject to pa nic, any m ore than the law of Inverse Squares is disturb ed by E lections. He will not be anxious about his affairs because they will no t be his; and f or that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, cle ar-headed confidence of an onl ooke r, with intelligence unc loude d by s elf-intere st and pow er unimpaired by pa ssion.) (28) Every man ha s a right to fulfil his own will without being a fraid that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in his proper place, it is t he fault of others if they interfere with him. (Illustration: If a man like Napoleon w ere actually appoi nted by de stiny to co ntrol Europe, he shoul d not be blamed for exercising hi s rights. To oppos e him would be an error.

The more firmly and s urely men move, a nd the more such action is accepted as the standard of morality, the less will conflict and c onfusion ha mper hum anity.)  - ------------- 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" I hope that the above principles will demonstrate to  ALL that their welfare, their very existence, is bound up i n  M AGICK. I trust that they will unde rstand, not only the reasonableness, but the necessi ty of the funda mental truth which I was the means of giving to mankind: \"Do what thou w ilt shall be the whole of the Law.\" I trust that they will assert themselves as individually absolute, that they wi ll grasp the fact that it is their right to assert themselves, and to accomplis h the task for which their nature fits them. Yea, more, that this is their dut y, and that not only to themselves but to others, a duty founde d upon uni versal necessity, and not to be shirked on a ccount of any c asual circumstances of the moment which may seem to put such conduc t in the light of inconve nience or eve n of cruelty. I hope that the principles outlined above will help them to unde rstand this book, a nd pr event them from being de terred from its study by t he more or less t echnical langua ge in which it is written. The essence of  M AGICK is simple enough i n all conscience. It is not otherwise with the art of gove rn ment. The Aim is simply pr osperity; but the theory is tangled, and the practic e beset with br iars. In the same way  M AGICK is merely to be and to do. I shoul d add: \"to suffer\". For Magick is the verb; and it is part of the Training to us e the passive voice. This is, how ever, a matter of Initiation r ather than of Magick in {X XII} its ordinary sense. It is not my fault if being is baffling, a nd doi ng de sperate! Yet, onc e the above principles are firmly fixed in the mind, i t is easy enou gh to sum up t he situation ve ry shortly. One must find out for one self, and m a ke sure beyond doubt , \"who\" one is, \"what\" one is, \"why\" one is. This done , on e may put the will which is implicit in the \"Why\" into words, or rather into On e Word. B eing thus conscious of the proper course to pur sue, the next thing is to unde rstand the condi tions necessary to following it out. After that, one m ust eliminate from one self every element alien or hos tile to success, and de vel op those parts of one self which are specially ne eded to control the aforesaid c ondi tions. Let us make an analogy. A nation m ust become aware of its own character bef ore it can be said to exist. From that know ledge it must divine its destiny. It must then consider the political condi tions of the world; how other count rie s may he lp it or hinder it. It must then de stroy it itself any e lements discor dant with its destiny. Lastly, it must develop in itself those qua lities which will enable it to combat successfully the external condi tions which threaten t o oppos e is pur pose. We have had a recent example in the case of the young G er man Empire, which, know ing itself and its will, disciplined and trained itself so that it conque red the neighbour s which ha d oppr essed it for so many c enturie s. But after 1866 a nd 1870, 1914! It mistook i tself for superhum an, it willed a thing impossible, it failed to eliminate its own internal jealousies, it fai led to unde rstand the condi tions of victory,> it did not train itself to hol d t he sea, and thus, having vi olated every pr inciple of  M AGICK, it was pulled dow n and br oken into pieces by pr ovincialism and de mocracy, so th at neither individual excellence nor civic virtue has yet availed to raise it a gain to that majestic unity which made so bol d a bid for the mastery of the rac e of man.

The processes described will enable him to discriminate between what he actually is, and w hat he has fondl y imagined himself to be >. He must behold his soul in all its awf ul nakedness, he must not fear to look on t hat appalling a ctuality. He must di 12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"scard the gaudy ga rments with which his shame has screened him; he must accept the fact that nothing c an make him anything but what he is. He may lie to hims elf, drug hi mself, hide himself; but he is always there. M agick will teach him that his mind is playing hi m traitor. It is as if a man were told that tailor s' fashion-plates were the canon of hum an be auty, so that he tried to make hims elf formless and f eatureless like them, and s hudde red with hor ror at the idea o f Holbein making a por trait of him. M agick will show him the beauty and m ajest y of the self which he has tried to suppr ess and di sguise. Having di scovered his identity, he will soon pe rceive his pur pose. Another process will show him how to make that pur pose pur e and pow erful. He may then learn how to estimate his environm ent, learn how to make allies, how to make hi mself prevail against all pow ers whose error has caused them to wander across h is path.

It is impossible to enter into a discussion of their relative merits in a pop ular manual of this sort. They may be studied in Erdmann's \"History of Philoso phy\" and s imilar treatises. All are reconciled and uni fied in the theory which we shall now set forth. The basis of this Harmony i s given in Crowley's \"Berashith\" --- to which reference shoul d be made. Infinite space is called the godde ss NUIT, while the infinitely small and a t omic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT.> These are unm anifest. One conjun ction of these infinites is called RA-HOOR-KHUIT,> a unity which includes and h eads all things.> (There is also a particular Nature of Him, in certain condi t ions, such as have obtained since the Spring of 1904, e .v.) This profoundl y my stical conception {1} i s based upon a ctual spiritual experience, but the traine d reason> can reach a reflection of this idea by t he method of logical contradi ction w hich ends in reason transcending itself. The reader shoul d consult \"The Soldier and the Hunchback\" in Equinox I , I, and K onx O m Pax. \"Unity\" transcends \"consciousness\". It is above all division. The Father o f thought --- the Word --- is called Chaos --- the dya d. The num ber Three, the Mother, is called Babalon. I n conne ction w ith this the reader shoul d study \" T he Temple of Solomon the King\" in Equinox I , V, and L iber 418. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" This first triad is essentially uni ty, in a manner transcending r eason. The comprehension of this Trinity is a matter of spiritual experience. All true g ods are attributed to this Trinity.> An immeasurable abyss divides it from all manifestations of Reason or the lo wer qua lities of man. I n the ultimate analysis of Reason, w e find a ll reason i dentified with this abyss. Yet this abyss is the crown of the mind. P urely in tellectual faculties all obtain he re. This abyss has no num ber, for in it all is confusion. Below this abyss we find the moral qua lities of Man, of which there are six. The highest is symbolised by t he num ber Four. Its nature is fatherly>; Mercy and Authority are the attributes of its dignity. The num ber Five is balanced against it. The attributes of Five are Energy a nd J ustice. Four and F ive are again combined and ha rmonized in the num ber Six, whose nature is beauty and ha rmony, mortality and immortality. In the num ber Seven the feminine nature is again pr edom inant, {2} but it is the masculine type of female, the Amazon, w ho is balanced in the num ber Eight b y the feminine type of male. In the num ber Nine we reach the last of the pur ely mental qua lities. It ide ntifies change with stability. Pendant to this sixfold system is the num ber Ten> which includes the whole of Matter as we know it by t he senses. It is impossible here to explain thoroughl y the complete conception; for it cannot be too c learly unde rstood t hat this is a \"classification\" of the Univers e, that there is nothing w hich is not comprehended therein. The Article on t he Qabalah in Vol. I, No. V of the Equinox i s the best which has been written on t he subject. It shoul d be deeply studied, in conne ction w ith the Qabalistic Diagrams in Nos. II and I II: \"The Temple of Solomon the King \". Such is a crude and e lementary sketch of this system. The formula of Tetragrammaton is the most important for the practical magici an. H ere Yod = 2, H e = 3, Vau = 4 to 9, H e final = 10. The Number Two represents Yod, t he Divine or Archetypal World, and the Number One is only attained by t he destruction of the God a nd the Magician in Samadhi. The world of Angels is unde r the num bers Four to Nine, and that of spirits un der the {3} num ber Ten.> All these num bers are of course parts of the magician himself considered as the microcosm. The microcosm is an exact image of the M acrocosm; the Great Work is the raising of the whole man in pe rfect balance to the pow er of Infinity. The reader will remark that all criticism directed against the Magical Hiera rchy is futile. One cannot call it incorrect --- the only line to take might b e that it was inconve nient. In the same way one cannot say that the Roman alph abet is better or worse than the Greek, since all required sounds can be more o r less satisfactorily represented by e ither; yet both these alphabets were foun d so little satisfactory when it came to an attempt at phone tic printing of Ori ental langua ges, that the alphabet had to be expanded by t he use of italics and other diacritical marks. In the same way our magical alphabet of the Sephirot h and the Paths (thirty-two letters as it were) has been expanded into the four worlds correspondi ng to the four letters of the name Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh; and e ach Sephira is suppos ed to contain a Tree of Life of its own. Thus we obtain four hundr ed Sephiroth instead of the original ten, and the Paths being c apable of similar multiplications, or rather of subdi vision, t he num ber is still further extended. O f course this process might be indefinitely continued without destr oying the original system. The Apologia for this System is that our pur est conceptions {4} a re symbolize d in M athematics. \"God is the Great Arithmetician.\" \"God is the Grand G eomete r.\" It is best therefore to pr epare to apprehend H im by f ormulating our minds according to these measures.> To return, each letter of this alphabet may ha ve its special magical sigil. The student must not expect to be given a cut-and-dried de finition of what exa ctly is meant by a ny of all this. On the contrary, he must work ba ckwards, put 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ting the whole of his mental and m oral outfit into these pigeon-holes. You w ou ld not expect to be able to buy a filing c abinet with the names of all your pas t, present and f uture corresponde nts ready indexed: your cabinet has a system o f letters and num bers meaningless in themselves, but ready to take on a meaning to you, a s you f ill up t he files. As your bus iness increased, each letter and num ber would receive fresh accessions of meaning f or you; and by a dopt ing this orderly arrangement you w ould be able to ha ve a much more comprehensive grasp of your affairs than would otherwise be the case. By the use of this system th e magician is able ultimately to uni fy the whole of his know ledge --- to transm ute, even on t he Intellectual Plane, the Many into the One. The Reader can now unde rstand that the sketch given above of the magical Hie rarchy is hardly even an out line of the real theory of the Universe. This theo ry may indeed be studied in the article already r eferred to in No. V of the Equ inox, a nd, m ore deeply in the Book of the Law and the Commentaries thereon: but the true unde rstanding de pends entirely upon t he work of the Magician himself. Without magical experience it will be meaningless. In this there is nothing pe culiar. It is so with all scientific know ledge. A blind m an might cram up a stronom y for the pur pose of passing e xaminations, b ut his know ledge would be {5} a lmost entirely unr elated to his experience, and it would certainly not give him sight. A similar phe nom enon i s obs erved when a gentleman who ha s taken an \"honour s degree\" in modern langua ges at Cambridge a rrives in Paris, and is una ble to or der his dinner. To exclaim against the Mas ter Therion is to act like a person w ho, obs erving this, shoul d attack bot h the professors of French and the inhabitants of Paris, and pe rhaps go on t o de ny t he existence of France. Let us say, onc e again, that the magical langua ge is nothing but a conve nien t system of classification to enable the magician to doc ket his experiences as he obtains them. Yet this is true also, that, onc e the langua ge is mastered, one can divine t he unknow n by s tudy of the know n, just as one 's know ledge of Latin and G reek en ables one to unde rstand s ome unf amiliar English word de rived from those sources . Also, there is the similar case of the Periodic Law in Chemistry, which enab les Science to pr ophe sy, and s o in the end to discover, the existence of certai n pr eviously uns uspected elements in na ture. All discussions upon phi losophy a re necessarily sterile, since truth is beyond l angua ge. They are, how ever, use ful if carried far enough - -- if carried to the point when it become apparent t hat all argum ents are argum ents in a circle.> But discussions of the details o f pur ely imaginary qua lities are frivolous and m ay be deadly. For the great da nger of this magical theory is that the student may mistake the alphabet for th e things which the words represent. An excellent man of great intelligence, a learned Qabalist, onc e amazed the Master Therion by s tating that the Tree of Life was the framework of the Univer se. It was as if some one had seriously maintained that a cat was a creature c onstructed by pl acing the letters C. A. T. in that order. It is no w onde r that Magick ha s excited the ridicule of the unintelligent, since even its {6} e duca ted students can be guilty of so gr oss a violation of the first principles of c ommon s ense.> A synops is of the grades of the A.'. A.'. as illustrative of the Magical Hie rarchy in M an is given in Appendix 2 \" One Star in Sight.\" This shoul d be read before proceeding w ith the chapter. The subject is very difficult. To de al wi th it in full is entirely be yond t he limits of this small treatise. \" FURTHER CONCERNING THE MAGICAL UNIVERSE\" All these letters of the magical alphabet --- referred to above --- are like so many na mes on a map. M an himself is a complete microcosm. Few other being s have this balanced pe rfection. O f course every sun, e very planet, may ha ve b eings similarly constituted.> But when we speak of dealing w ith the planets in Magick, {7} t he reference is usually not to the actual planets, but to pa rts o f the earth which are of the nature attributed to these planets. Thus, when we say that Nakhiel is the \"Intelligence\" of the Sun, w e do not mean that he live 16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"s in the Sun, but only that he has a certain rank a nd c haracter; and a lthough w e can invoke him, we do not necessarily mean that he exists in the same sense o f the word in which our butcher exists. When we \"conjure Nakhiel to visible appearance,\" it may be that our process re sembles creation - -- or, rather imagination - -- more nearly than it doe s callin g-forth. The aura of a man is called the \"magical mirror of the universe\"; and , so far as any one can tell, not hing e xists outside of this mirror. It is at least conve nient to represent the whole as if it were subjective. It leads to less confusion. And, a s a man is a perfect microcosm,> it is perfectly easy to re-model one 's conception a t any m oment. Now there is a traditional corresponde nce, which modern experiment has show n to be fairly reliable. There is a certain na tural conne xion be tween certain l etters, words, num bers, gestures, shapes, perfumes and s o on, s o that any idea or (as we might call it) \"spirit\", may be composed or called forth by t he use o f those things which are harmonious with it, and e xpress particular parts of it s nature. These corresponde nces have been elaborately mapped in the Book 777 i n a very conve nient and c ompendious form. It will be necessary for the student to make a careful study of this book i n conne xion w ith some actual rituals of Magick, for example, {8} t hat of the evocation of Taphtatharath pr inted in Equi nox I , III, pages 170- 190, w here he will see exactly why these things are to be used. O f course, as the student advances in know ledge by e xperience he will f ind a progressive subtlety in the magical universe correspondi ng to his own; fo r let it be said ye t again! not only is his aura a magical mirror of the univer se, but the universe is a magical mirror of his aura. In this chapter we are only able to give a very thin out line of magical theo ry --- faint pencilling by w eak and w avering f ingers --- for this subject may a lmost be said to be co-extensive with one 's whole know ledge. The know ledge of exoteric science is comically limited by t he fact that we h ave no a ccess, except in the most indirect way, to any ot her celestial body t ha n our own. I n the last few years, the semi-educated ha ve got an idea that they know a great deal about the universe, and the principal ground f or their fine opinion of themselves is usually the telephone or the airship. I t is pitiful t o read the bom bastic twaddle about progress, which journalists and ot hers, who wish to pr event men from thinking, put out for consumption. We know infinitesi mally little of the material universe. Our detailed know ledge is so contemptib ly minute, that it is hardly worth reference, save that our shame may spur us t o increased endeavour . Such know ledge> as we have got is of a very ge neral and abstruse, of a philosophi cal and a lmost magical character. This consists prin cipally of the conceptions of pur e mathematics. It is, therefore, almost legit imate to say that pur e mathematics is our link w ith the rest of the universe an d with \"God\". Now the conceptions of Magick are themselves profoundl y mathematical. The w hole basis of our theory is the Qabalah, w hich corresponds to mathematics and g eometry. The method of ope ration in M agick is based on t his, in ve ry much the same way as the laws of mechanics are based on m athematics. So far, therefore as we can be said to pos sess a magical theory of the universe, it must be a mat ter solely of funda mental law, with a {9} f ew simple and c omprehensive propos it ions stated in ve ry ge neral terms. I might expend a life-time in exploring the details of one plane, just as an explorer might give his life to one corner of Africa, or a chemist to one subg roup of compounds . Each such de tailed piece of work may be very va luable, but it doe s not as a rule throw light on t he main pr inciples of the universe. Its truth is the truth of one angle. It might even lead to error, if some inferior person w ere to ge neralize from too f ew facts. Imagine an inhabitant of Mars who w ished to phi losophi se about the earth, an d ha d not hing to go by but the diary of some man at the North Pole! But the wo rk of every explorer, on w hatever branch of the Tree of Life the caterpillar he is after may ha ppen to be crawling, i s immensely he lped by a grasp of general principles. Every magician, therefore, shoul d study t he Holy Qabalah. O nce he has mastered the main pr inciples, he will find hi s work gr ow easy. 17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" \"Solvitur ambulando\" which doe s not mean: \"Call the Ambulance!\"  - ------------- {10}  C HAPTER I THE PRINCIPLES OF RITUAL. There is a single main de finition of the object of all magical Ritual. It is the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm. The Supreme and C omplete Ritu al is therefore the Invoc ation of the Holy Guardian Angel;> or, in the langua ge of Mysticism, Union w ith God.> All other magical Rituals are particular cases of this general principle, an d the only excuse for doing them is that it sometimes occurs that one particula r por tion of the microcosm is so weak that its imperfection of impurity would v itiate the Macrocosm of which it is the image, Eidolon, or Reflexion. F or exam ple, God is above sex; and therefore neither man nor woman as such can be said fully to unde rstand, m uch less to represent, God. I t is therefore incumbent on the male magician to cultivate those female virtues in which he is deficient, and this task he must of course accomplish without in any w ay impairing hi s vir ility. It will then be lawful for a magician to invoke Isis, and identify hims elf with he r; if he fail to do t his, his apprehension of the Universe when he a ttains Samadhi will lack the conception of maternity. The result will be a met aphys ical and - -- by c orollary --- ethical limitation in the Religion w hich he founds . Judaism and I slam are striking e xample of this failure. To take another example, the ascetic life which de votion to {1 1} m agick so o ften invol ves argues a pove rty of nature, a narrowness, a lack of generosity. Nature is infinitely pr odigal --- not one in a million s eeds ever comes to frui tion. Whoso fails to recogni se this, let him invoke Jupiter.> The danger of ceremonial magick --- the sublest and de epest danger --- is th is: that the magician will naturally tend to invoke that partial being w hich mo st strongl y appeals to him, so that his natural excess in that direction w ill b e still further exaggerated. L et him, before beginning hi s Work, endeavour to map out his own be ing, a nd a rrange his invoc ations in such a way as to redress the balance.> This, of course, shoul d ha ve been done in a preliminary fashion during the preparation of the weapons and f urniture of the Temple. To consider in a more particular manner this que stion of the Nature of Ritua l, we may suppos e that he finds himself lacking in that perception of the value of Life and D eath, alike of individuals and of races, which is characteristic of Nature. He has perhaps a tendency to pe rceive the \"first nobl e truth\" utter ed by B uddha , that Everything is sorrow. Nature, it seems, is a tragedy. He h as perhaps even experienced the great trance called Sorrow. He shoul d then con sider whether there is not some Deity who e xpresses this Cycle, and ye t whose n ature is joy. He will find w hat he requires in Dionys us. There are three main methods of invoki ng a ny D eity. The \"First Method\" consists of devotion to that Deity, and, be ing m ainly mys tical in character, need not be dealt with in this place, especially as a perfe ct instruction e xists in Liber 175 ( \"See\" Appendix). The \"Second m ethod\" is the straight forward ceremonial invoc ation. I t is the method w hich was usually employed in the Middle Ages. Its advantage is its di rectness, its disadvantage its {12} c rudity. The \"Goetia\" gives clear instruct ion in this method, a nd s o do m any ot her rituals, white and bl ack. We shall pr esently de vote some space to a clear expos ition of this Art. 18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" In the case of Bacchus, how ever, we may roughl y out line the procedure. We f ind that the symbolism of Tiphareth expresses the nature of Bacchus. It is the n ne cessary to construct a Ritual of Tiphareth. L et us ope n the Book 777; we s hall find in line 6 of each column the various parts of our required apparatus. Having or dered everything dul y, we shall exalt the mind by r epeated pr ayers o r conjurations to the highest conception of the God, unt il, in one sense or ano ther of the word, H e appears to us and f loods our consciousness with the light of His divinity. The \"Third M ethod i s the Dramatic,\" perhaps the most attractive of all; cert ainly it is so to the artist's temperament, for it appeals to his imagination t hrough hi s aesthetic sense. Its disadvantage lies principally in the difficulty of its performance by a single person. B ut it has the sanction of the highest antiquity, and is probab ly the most useful for the founda tion of a religion. I t is the method of Catho lic Christianity, and c onsists in the dramatization of the legend of the God. The Bacchae of Euripides is a magnificent example of such a Ritual; so also, th rough i n a less degree, is the Mass. We may also mention m any of the degrees i n Freemasonry, particularly the third. The 5 D egree = 6Square Ritual publ ished in No. III of the Equinox i s another example. In the case of Bacchus, one commemorates firstly his birth of a mortal mothe r who ha s yielded he r treasure-hous e to the Father of All, of the jealousy and rage excited by t his incarnation, a nd of the heavenly pr otection a fforded to th e infant. Next shoul d be commemorated the journeying w estward upon a n ass. No w comes the great scene of the drama: the gentle, exqui site yout h with his foll owing ( chiefly composed of women) seems to threaten the established or der of th ings, and that Established Order takes steps to put an end to the ups tart. We find D ionys us confronting the angry King, not with de fiance, but with meekness; yet with a subtle confidence, an unde rlying laught er. His forehead is wreathe d with vine tendrils. He is an effeminate figure with those broad leaves clust ered upon hi s brow? But those leaves hide {13} hor ns. King P entheus, represen tative of respectability,> is destroyed by hi s pride. He goe s out into the mou ntains to attack the women who ha ve followed Bacchus, the yout h whom he has moc ked, scourged, and put in chains, yet who ha s only smiled; and by t hose women, in their divine madness, he is torn to pieces. It has already s eemed impertinent to say so much when Walter Pater has told the story with such sympathy a nd insight. We will not further transgress by dw elling upon t he identity of this legend w ith the course of Nature, its madness, its prodigality, its intoxication, i ts joy, and a bove all its sublime persiste nce through t he cycles of Life and D eath. The pagan reader must labour to unde rstand this in Pater's \"Greek Studies\", and the Christian reader will recogni se it, incident for incident, in the story of Christ. This legend is but the dra matization of Spring. The magician who w ishes to invoke Bacchus by t his method m ust therefore arra nge a ceremony i n which he takes the part of Bacchus, unde rgoes all His trials, and e merges triumphant from beyond de ath. H e must, how ever, be warned against mistaking the symbolism. In this case, for example, the doc trine of individua l immortality ha s been dr agged in, to the destruction of truth. I t is not that utterly worthless part of man, hi s individual consciousness as John S mith, w hi ch de fies death --- that consciousness which dies and is reborn in every though t.

A chapter will be consecrated to removing the practical difficulties of this method of Invoc ation. I t will doubt less have been not ed by t he acumen of the reader that in the great essentials these three methods are one . In each case the magician identifies himself with the Deity invoke d. To \"invoke \" is to \"cal l in\", just as to \"evoke \" is to \"call forth\". This is the essential difference 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":" between the two br anches of Magick. I n invoc ation, t he macrocosm floods the c onsciousness. In evocation, t he magician, ha ving be come the macrocosm, creates a microcosm. You \" in\"voke a God into the Circle. You \" e\"voke a Spirit into t he Triangle. In the first method i dentity with the God is attained by l ove and by s urrender, by gi ving up or suppr essing a ll irrelevant (and illusionary) par ts of your self. It is the weeding of a garden. In the second m ethod i dentity is attained by pa ying s pecial attention to the desired pa rt of your self: pos itive, as the first method i s negative. It is th e potting-out and w atering of a particular flower in the garden, and the expos u re of it to the sun. In the third, identity is attained by s ympathy. It is very difficult for th e ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a nove l; but for those who c an do s o, this method i s unque stionably the best. Observe: each element in this cycle is of equal value. It is wrong t o say t riumphantly \"Mors janua vitae\", unl ess you a dd, w ith equal triumph, \" Vita janua mortis\". To one who unde rstands this chain of the Aeons from the point of vie w alike of the sorrowing I sis and of the triumphant Osiris, not forgetting thei r link in the destroyer Apophi s, there remains no s ecret veiled in Nature. He cries that name of God w hich throughout History ha s been echoed by one religion to another, the infinite swelling pa ean I.A.O.!> {15}  C HAPTER II THE FORMULAE OF THE ELEMENTAL WEAPONS. Before discussing m agical formulae in de tail, one may obs erve that most ritu als are composite, and c ontain many f ormulae which must be harmonized into one . The first formula is that of the Wand. I n the sphere of the principle which the magician wishes to invoke , he rises from point to poi nt in a perpendicular line, and then de scends; or else, beginning a t the top, he comes directly dow n , \"invoki ng\" first the god of that sphere by \" devout suppl ication\"> that He may deign to send the appropriate Archangel. He then \"beseeches\" the Archangel to send the Angel or Angels of that sphere to his aid; he \"conjures\" this Angel o r Angels to send the intelligence in que stion, a nd this intelligence he will \"c onjure with authority\" to compel the obe dience of the spirit and hi s manifestat ion. To this spirit he \"issues commands\". It will be seen that this is a formula rather of evocation than of invoc atio n, and f or the latter the procedure, though a pparently the same, shoul d be conc eived of in a different manner, which br ings it unde r another formula, that of Tetragrammaton. The essence of the force invoke d is one , but the \"God\" represe nts the germ or beginning of the force, the \"Archangel\" its developm ent; and s o on, unt il, with the \"Spirit\", we have the completion a nd pe rfection of that fo rce. {16} The formula of the Cup is not so well suited for Evocations, and the magical Hierarchy is not invol ved in the same way; for the Cup be ing pa ssive rather th an active, it is not fitting f or the magician to us e it in respect of anything but the Highest. In pr actical working it consequently means little but prayer, and that prayer the \"prayer of silence\".> The formula of the dagger is again uns uitable for either pur pose, since the na ture of the dagger is to criticise, to de stroy, to disperse; and a ll true magic al ceremonies tend to concentration. The dagger will therefore appear principa lly in the banishings, preliminary to the ceremony pr oper. The formula of the pantacle is again of no pa rticular use; for the pantacle is inert. In fine, the formula of the wand is the only one with which we need more particularly concern our selves.> 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":" Now in or der to invoke any be ing, i t is said by H ermes Trismegistus that the magi employ three methods . The first, for the vulgar, is that of suppl ication . In this the crude objective theory is assumed as true. There is a god na med A, whom you, B , proceed to pe tition, i n exactly the same sense as a boy m ight ask his father for poc ket-money. The second m ethod i nvol ves a little more subtlety, inasmuch as the magician endeavour s to ha rmonize himself with the nature of the god, a nd to a certain ex tent exalts himself, in the course of the ceremony; but the third method i s the only one worthy of our consideration. This consists of a real identification of the magician and the god. N ote th at to do t his in pe rfection invol ves the attainment of a species of Samadhi: an d this fact alone suffices to link irrefragably magick with mysticism. Let us describe the magical method of identification. The symbolic form of the god i s first studied with as much care as an artist would be stow upon hi s m odel, so that a perfectly clear and {17} uns hakeable mental picture of the god is presented to the mind. S imilarly, the attributes of the god a re enshrined i n speech, and s uch speeches are committed pe rfectly to memory. The invoc ation will then be gin with a prayer to the god, c ommemorating hi s phys ical attributes , always with pr ofound unde rstanding of their real meaning. I n the \"second pa r t\" of the invoc ation, t he voice of the god i s heard, and H is characteristic utt erance is recited. In the \"third por tion\" of the invoc ation the magician asserts the identity o f himself with the god. I n the \"fourth por tion\" the god i s again invoke d, but as if by H imself, as if it were the utterance of the will of the god t hat He sh ould manifest in the magician. At the conclusion of this, the original object of the invoc ation is stated. Thus, in the invoc ation of Thoth which is to be found i n the rite of Mercury (Equinox I , VI) and in Liber LXIV, the first part begins with the words \"Majes ty of Godhe ad, w isdom -crowned TAHUTI, Thee, Thee I invoke . Oh Thou of the Ibis head, Thee, Thee I invoke \"; and s o on. At the conclusion of this a mental ima ge of the God, i nfinitely va st and infinitely splendid, shoul d be perceived, in just the same sense as a man might see the Sun. The second pa rt begins with the words: \"Behold! I am yesterday, today, and the brother of tomorrow.\" The magician shoul d imagine that he is hearing this voice, and a t the same t ime that he is echoing it, that it is true also of himself. This thought shoul d so exalt him that he is able at its conclusion to utter the sublime words whi ch ope n the third pa rt: \"Behold! he is in me, and I am in him.\" At this moment , he loses consciousness of his mortal being; he is that mental image which he previously but saw. This consciousness is only complete as he goe s on: \"Mine i s the radiance wherein Ptah floateth ove r his firmament. I travel upon hi gh. I tread upon t he firmament of Nu. I raise a flashing f lame with the lightnings of mine eye: ever rushing on i n the splendour of the daily glorified Ra --- gi ving m y life to the treaders of Earth!\" This thought gives the relation of God and M an from the divine point of view. The magician is only recalled to himself at the conclusion of the {18} t hird p art; in which oc cur, almost as if by a ccident, the words: \"Therefore do a ll thi ngs obe y my word.\" Yet in the fourth pa rt, which be gins: \"Therefore do t hou c o me forth unt o me\", it is not really the magician who is addressing the God; it is the God w ho he ars the far-off utterance of the magician. I f this invoc ation has been correctly pe rformed, the words of the fourth pa rt will sound di stant and s trange. It is surprising that a dum my (so the magus now appears to Himsel f) shoul d be able to speak! The Egypt ian Gods are so complete in their nature, so pe rfectly spiritual an d ye t so pe rfectly material, that this one invoc ation is sufficient. The God b ethinks him that the spirit of Mercury shoul d now appear to the magician; and i t is so. This Egypt ian formula is therefore to be preferred to the Hierarchica l formula of the Hebrews with its tedious prayers, conjurations, and c urses. It will be noted, how ever, that in this invoc ation of Thoth which we have su mmarized, there is another formula contained, the Reverberating or Reciprocatin 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"g formula, which may be called the formula of Horus and H arpocrates. The magic ian addresses the God w ith an active projection of his will, and then be comes p assive while the God a ddresses the Universe. In the fourth pa rt he remains sil ent, listening, t o the prayer which arises therefrom. The formula of this invoc ation of Thoth may also be classed unde r Tetragramm aton. The first part is fire, the eager prayer of the magician, the second w at er, in which the magician listens to, or catches the reflection of , the god. T he third pa rt is air, the marriage of fire and w ater; the god a nd the man ha ve become one ; while the fourth pa rt corresponds to earth, the conde nsation or mat erialization of those three higher principles. With regard to the Hebrew formulae, it is doubt ful whether most magicians wh o us e them have ever properly gr asped the principles unde rlying the method of i dentity. No pa ssage which implies it occurs to mind, a nd the extant rituals ce rtainly give no hi nt of such a conception, or of any but the most personal and material views of the nature of things. They seem to ha ve thought that there w as an Archangel named Ratziel in exactly the same sense as there was a statesma n na med Richelieu, an individual being living in a definite place. He had pos s ibly certain pow ers of a somewhat metaphys ical order --- he might be {19} i n tw o places at onc e,> for example, though e ven the pos sibility of so simple a feat (in the case of spirits) seems to be denied by c ertain pa ssages in extant conj urations which tell the spirit that if he happens to be in chains in a particul ar place in Hell, or if some other magician is conjuring hi m so that he cannot come, then let him send a spirit of similar nature, or otherwise avoid the diff icultly. But of course so vul gar a conception w ould not occur to the student o f the Qabalah. I t is just pos sible that the magi wrote their conjurations on this crude hypot hesis in or der to avoid the cloudi ng of the mind by doubt and m etaphys ical speculation. He who be came the Master Therion w as onc e confronted by t his very difficulty . Being de termined to instruct mankind, H e sought a simple statement of his ob ject. His will was sufficiently informed by c ommon s ense to de cide him to teac h man \"The Next Step\", the thing w hich was immediately above him. He might hav e called this \"God\", or \"The Higher Self\", or \"The Augoe ides\", or \"Adi-Buddha \", or 61 ot her things --- but He had discovered that these were all one , yet that each one represented some theory of the Universe which would ultimately be sha ttered by c riticism --- for He had already pa ssed through t he realm of Reason, and kne w that every statement contained an absurdity. He therefore said: \"Let me declare this Work unde r this title: 'The obtaining of the Know ledge and C onv ersation of the Holy Guardian Angel'\", because the theory implied in these word s is so pa tently absurd that only simpletons would waste much time in analysing it. It would be accepted as a conve ntion, a nd no one would incur the grave da nger of building a philosophi cal system upon i t. With this unde rstanding, w e may rehabilitate the Hebrew system of invoc ations. The mind is the great enemy; so, by i nvoki ng e nthusiastically a person w hom w e know not to exist, we are rebuki ng that mind. Yet we shoul d not refrain alto gether from philosophi sing in the light of the Holy Qabalah. We shoul d accept the Magical Hierarchy a s a more or less conve nient classification of the facts of the Universe as they are {20} know n to us ; and a s our know ledge and unde rsta nding of those facts increase, so shoul d we endeavour to adjust our idea of wha t we mean by a ny s ymbol. At the same time let us reflect that there is a certain de finite consensus o f experience as to the correlation of the various beings of the hierarchy w ith the obs erved facts of Magick. I n the simple matter of astral vision, f or examp le, one striking c ase may be quot ed. Without telling hi m what it was, the Master Therion onc e recited as an invoc ation S appho's \"Ode to Venus\" before a Probationer of the A.'. A.'. w ho w as ign orant of Greek, the langua ge of the Ode. The disciple then went on a n \"astral journey,\" and e verything s een by hi m was without exception ha rmonious with Venu s. This was true dow n to the smallest detail. He even obt ained all the four c olour-scales of Venus with absolute correctness. Considering that he saw somet hing like one hundr ed symbols in all, the odds against coincidence are incalcul 22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ably gr eat. Such an experience (and the records of the A.'. A.'. contain doz en s of similar cases) affords proof as absolute as any pr oof can be in this world of Illusion that the corresponde nces in Liber 777 r eally represent facts in Na ture. It sugge sts itself that this \"straightforward\" system of magick was perhaps never really employed at all. One might maintain that the invoc ations which ha ve come dow n to us are but the ruins of the Temple of Magick. The exorcisms mi ght have been committed to writing f or the pur pose of memorising them, while it was forbidden to make any r ecord of the really important parts of the ceremony . Such de tails of Ritual as we pos sess are meagre and unc onvi ncing, a nd though much success has been attained in the quite conve ntional exoteric way bot h by FRATER PERDURABO and by m any of his colleagues, yet ceremonies of this characte r have always remained tedious and di fficult. It has seemed as if the success were obtained almost in spite of the ceremony. In any c ase, they are the more mysterious parts of the Ritual which ha ve evoke d the divine force. Such conjur ations as those of the \"Goetia\" leave one cold, although, not ably in the second conjuration, t here is a crude attempt to us e that formula of Commemoration of which we spoke in the preceding C hapter. {21}  C HAPTER III THE FORMULA OF TETRAGRAMMATON.> This formula is of most universal aspect, as all things are necessarily comp rehended in it; but its use in a magical ceremony i s little unde rstood. The climax of the formula is in one sense before even the formulation of the Yod. F or the Yod is the most divine aspect of the Force --- the remaining let ters are but a solidification of the same thing. I t must be unde rstood t hat we are here speaking of the whole ceremony c onsidered as a unity, not merely of t hat formula in which \"Yod\" is the god i nvoke d, \"He\" the Archangel, and s o on. In or der to unde rstand the ceremony unde r this formula, we must take a more ext ended view of the functions of the four weapons than we have hitherto done . The formation of the \"Yod\" is the formulation of the first creative force, o f that father who is called \"self-begotten\", and unt o whom it is said: \"Thou ha s formulated thy F ather, and m ade fertile thy M other\". The adding of the \"He\" to the \"Yod\" is the marriage of that Father to the great co-equal Mother, who i s a reflection of Nuit as He is of Hadit. Their union br ings forth the son \" Va u\" who is the heir. Finally the daught er \"He\" is produc ed. S he is both the tw in sister and the daught er of \"Vau\".> His mission is to redeem her by m aking he r his bride; the result of this is to set her upon t he throne of her mother, and it is only she whose yout hful emb race can reawaken the eld of the {22} All-Father. In this complex family relat ionship> is symbolised the whole course of the Universe. It will be seen that (after all) the Climax is at the end. I t is the second ha lf of the formula whi ch symbolises the Great Work which we are pledged to accomplish. The first ste p of this is the attainment of the Know ledge and C onve rsation of the Holy Guard ian Angel, which constitutes the Adept of the Inner Order. The re-entry of these twin spous es into the womb of the mother is that initi ation de scribed in Liber 418, w hich gives admission to the Inmost Order of the A.'. A.'. O f the last step we cannot speak. It will now be recogni sed that to de vise a practical magical ceremony t o cor respond t o Tetragrammaton in this exalted sense might be difficult if not impos sible. In such a ceremony t he Rituals of pur ification a lone might occupy m any incarnations. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":" It will be necessary, therefore, to revert to the simpler view of Tetragramm aton, r emembering onl y that the \"He\" final is the Throne of the Spirit, of the Shin of Pentagrammaton. The Yod w ill represent a swift and vi olent creative energy; following this w ill be a calmer and m ore reflective but even more pow erful flow of will, the ir resistible force of a mighty river. This state of mind w ill be followed by a n expansion of the consciousness; it will penetrate all space, and this will fina lly unde rgo a crystallization r esplendent with interior light. Such modificati ons of the original Will may be obs erved in the course of the invoc ations when they are properly pe rformed. The peculiar dangers of each are obvi ous --- that of the first is a flash in the pan --- a misfire; that of the second, a falling into dr eaminess or reveri e; that of the third, loss of concentration. A mistake in any of these points will prevent, or injure the proper formation of , the fourth. In the expression w hich will be used in Chapter XV: \"Enflame thyself\", etc., only the first stage is specified; but if that is properly done the other stag es will follow as if by ne cessity. So far is it written concerning the formul a of Tetragrammaton. {23}  C HAPTER IV. THE FORMULA OF ALHIM, AND THAT OF ALIM. \"ALHIM\", (Elohim) is the exoteric word for Gods.> It is the masculine plural of a feminine noun, but its nature is principally feminine.> It is a perfect h ieroglyph of the num ber 5. This shoul d be studied in \"A Note on G enesis\" (Equi nox I , II). The Elements are all represented, as in Tetragrammaton, but there is no de ve lopm ent from one into the others. They are, as it were, thrown together --- un tamed, onl y sympathising by vi rtue of their wild and s tormy but elastically re sistless energy. The Central letter is \"He\" --- the letter of breath --- and r epresents Spirit. The first letter \"Aleph\" is the natural letter of Air, and t he Final \"Mem\" is the natural letter of Water. Together, \"Aleph\" and \" Mem\" mak e \"Am\" --- the mother within whose womb the Cosmos is conceived. B ut \"Yod\" is not the natural letter of Fire. Its juxtaposition w ith \"He\" sanctifies that fi re to the \"Yod\" of Tetragrammaton. S imilarly we find \" Lamed\" for Earth, w here we shoul d expect Tau --- in or der to emphasize the influence of Venus, who r ule s Libra. \"ALHIM\", therefore, represents rather the formula of Consecration than that of a complete ceremony. It is the breath of benediction, ye t so pot ent that it can give life to clay and light to da rkness. In consecrating a weapon, \" Aleph\" is the whirling f orce of the thunde rbolt, the lightning w hich flameth out of the East even {24} i nto the West. This is t he gift of the wielding of the thunde rbolt of Zeus or Indra, the god of Air. \" Lamed\" is the Ox-goad, the driving f orce; and it is also the Balance, represent ing the truth and love of the Magician. I t is the loving c are which he bestows upon pe rfecting hi s instruments, and the equilibration of that fierce force wh ich initiates the ceremony.> \"Yod\" is the creative energy - - the procreative pow er: and ye t \"Yod\" is the solitude and s ilence of the hermitage into which the Magician ha s shut himself. \"Mem\" is the letter of water, and it is the Mem final, whose long f lat lines sugge st the Sea at Peace HB:Mem-final ; not the ordinary (initial and m edial) M em whose hieroglyph i s a wave HB:Mem.> And then, in the Centre of all, broods Spirit, which combines the mildness of the Lamb with the hor ns of the Ram, and is the letter of Bacchus or \"Christ\".> 24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" After the magician ha s created his instrument, and ba lanced it truly, and f ill ed it with the lightnings of his Will, then is the weapon l aid away to r est; and in this Silence, a true Consecration c omes.  THE FORMULA OF ALIM It is extremely interesting to contrast with the above the formula of the el emental Gods deprived of the creative spirit. One {25} m ight suppos e that as A LIM, is the masculine plural of the masculine noun AL, its formula would be mor e virile than that of ALHIM, which is the masculine plural of the feminine noun ALH. A moment's investigation is sufficient to dissipate the illusion. The w ord masculine has no m eaning e xcept in relation to some feminine correlative. The word ALIM may in fact be considered as neuter. By a rather absurd conve ntion, ne uter objects are treated as feminine on a ccount of their superficial r esemblance in pa ssivity and inertness with the unf ertilized female. But the fe male produc es life by t he intervention of the male, while the neuter doe s so on ly when impregnated by S pirit. Thus we find the feminine AMA, becoming AIMA>, through t he ope ration of the pha llic Yod, w hile ALIM, the congr ess of dead elem ents, onl y fructifies by t he broodi ng of Spirit. This being s o, how can we describe ALIM as containing a Magical Formula? Inqui ry discloses the fact that this formula is of a very special kind. The word adds up t o 81, w hich is a num ber of the moon. I t is thus the formula of witchcraft, which is unde r Hecate.> It is only the romantic mediaeval perv ersion of science that represents young w omen as partaking in witchcraft, which is, properly speaking, r estricted to the use of such women as are no l onge r wo men in the Magical sense of the word, be cause thy a re no l onge r capable of corr espondi ng to the formula of the male, and a re therefore neuter rather than femi nine. It is for this reason that their method ha s always been referred to the moon, i n that sense of the term in which she appears, not as the feminine corre lative of the sun, but as the bur nt-out, dead, airless satellite of earth. No true Magical ope ration c an be performed by t he formula of ALIM. All the works of witchcraft are illusory; and their apparent effects depend on t he idea that it is pos sible to alter things by t he mere rearrangement of them. One {2 6} m ust not rely upon t he false analogy of the Xylenes to rebut this argum ent. It is quite true that geometrical isomers act in different manners towards the substance to which they are brought into relation. And it is of course necess ary sometimes to rearrange the elements of a molecule before that molecule can form either the masculine or the feminine element in a true Magical combination with some other molecule. It is therefore occasionally inevitable for a Magician to reorganize the str ucture of certain elements before proceeding to his ope ration pr oper. Although such work is technically witchcraft, it must not be regarded as unde sirable on that ground, f or all ope rations which do not transmute matter fall strictly sp eaking unde r this heading. The real objection to this formula is not inherent in its own na ture. Witch craft consists in treating it as the exclusive preoccupation of Magick, and e sp ecially in de nying to the Holy Spirit his right to indw ell His Temple.> {27}  C HAPTER V  The Formula of I.A.O. This formula is the principal and m ost characteristic formula of Osiris, of the Redemption of Mankind. \" I\" is Isis, Nature, ruined by \" A\", Apophi s the De stroyer, and r estored to life by t he Redeemer Osiris.> The same idea is expres 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"sed by t he Rosicrucian formula of the Trinity: \" Ex Deo na scimur. I n Jesu M orimur P er Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus.\" This is also identical with the Word Lux, L .V.X., which is formed by t he arms of a cross. It is this formula which is implied in those ancient and m odern mo num ents in which the pha llus is worshipped as the Saviour of the World. The doc trine of resurrection a s vulgarly unde rstood i s false and a bsurd. I t is not even \"Scriptural\". St. Paul doe s not identify the glorified body w hich rises with the mortal body w hich dies. On the contrary, he repeatedly insists on t he distinction. The same is true of a magical ceremony. The magician who is destroyed by a b sorption in the Godhe ad is really de stroyed. The {28} m iserable mortal automat on r emains in the Circle. It is of no m ore consequence to Him that the dus t of the floor.> But before entering into the details of \"I.A.O.\" as a magick formula it shou ld be remarked that it is essentially the formula of Yoga or meditation; in fac t, of elementary mysticism in all its branches. In be ginning a meditation pr actice, there is always> a quiet pleasure, a gentl e natural growth; one takes a lively interest in the work; it seems easy; one i s quite pleased to ha ve started. This stage represents Isis. Soone r or later it is succeeded by de pression - -- the Dark Night of the Soul, an infinite weari ness and de testation of the work. The simplest and e asiest acts become almost impossible to pe rform. Such impotence fills the mind w ith apprehension a nd de s pair. The intensity of this loathing c an ha rdly be unde rstood by a ny pe rson w h o ha s not experienced it. This is the period of Apophi s. It is followed by t he arising not of Isis, but of Osiris. The ancient condi tion is not restored, but a new and s uperior condi tion is created, a condi tion only rendered pos sible by t he process of death. The Alchemists themselves taught this same truth. The first matter of the w ork was base and pr imitive, though \" natural\". After passing through va rious st ages the \"black dr agon\" appeared; but from this arose the pur e and pe rfect gold . Even in the legend of Prometheus we find a n identical formula concealed; and a similar remark applies to those of Jesus Christ, and of many ot her mythical go d-men worshipped in different count ries.> A magical ceremony c onstructed on t his formula is thus in close essential ha rmony w ith the natural mystic process. We find it the {29} ba sis of many impor tant initiations, not ably the Third Degree in M asonry, and the 5 D egree = 6Squa re ceremony of the G.'. D .'. de scribed in Equinox I , III. A ceremonial self-in itiation m ay be constructed with advantage on t his formula. The essence of it consists in robing your self as a king, t hen stripping a nd s laying your self, and rising f rom that death to the Know ledge and C onve rsation of the Holy Guardian Angel>. There is an etymological identity be tween Tetragrammaton a nd \" I A O\", but the magical formulae are entirely different, as the descriptions here given have schewn. Professor William James, in his \"Varieties of Religious Experience,\" has wel l classified religion a s the \"once-born\" and the \"twice-born\"; but the religion now proclaimed in Liber Legis harmonizes these by t ranscending them. There is no a ttempt to ge t rid of death by de nying it, as among t he onc e-born; nor to a ccept death as the gate of a new life, as among t he twice-born. With the A.'. A.'. life and de ath are equally incidents in a career, very much like day and n ight in the history of a planet. But, to pur sue the simile, we regard this pla net from afar. A Brother of A.'. A.'. looks at (what another person w ould call ) \"himself\", as one --- or, rather, some --- among a group of phe nom ena. He is that \"nothing\" whose consciousness is in one sense the universe considered as a single phe nom enon i n time and s pace, and in another sense is the negation of that consciousness. The body a nd m ind of the man are only important (if at all ) as the telescope of the astronom er to him. If the telescope were destroyed i t would make no a ppreciable difference to the Universe which that telescope rev 26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"eals. It will now be unde rstood t hat this formula of I A O is a formula of Tiphare th. The magician who e mploys it is conscious of himself as a man liable to suf fering, a nd a nxious to transcend that state by be coming one with god. I t will appear to him as the Supreme Ritual, as the final step; but, as has already be e n {30} poi nted out , it is but a preliminary. For the nor mal man today, how ever , it represents considerable attainment; and there is a much earlier formula wh ose investigation w ill occupy C hapter VI. THE MASTER THERION, in the Seventeenth ye ar of the Aeon, ha s reconstructed t he Word I A O to satisfy the new condi tions of Magick imposed by pr ogress. The Word of the Law being Thelema, whose num ber is 93, t his num ber shoul d be the c anon of a correspondi ng M ass. Accordingly, he has expanded I A O by t reating t he O as an Ayin, and then adding Vau as prefix and a ffix. The full word is the n Vau Yod Aleph Ayin Vau whose num ber is 93. We may analyse this new Word in de tail and de monstrate tha t it is a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of Self-Initiation in this Aeon of Ho rus.

The Great Work conceived as a straightforw ard simple affair. We find the theory reflected in the customs of Matriarchy. Parthenoge nesis is suppos ed to be true. The Virgin (Yod-Virgo) contains in he rself the Princip le of Growth --- the epicene Hermetic seed. I t becomes the Babe in the Egg ( A --- Harpocrates) by vi rtue of the Spirit (A = Air, impregnating the Mother---Vu lture) and this becomes the Sun or Son ( Digamma = the letter of Tiphareth, 6, even when spelt as Omega, in Coptic. See 777) . \"Aeon of Osiris.\" Patriarchal age. Two sexes. I conceived as the Father-W and. ( Yod in Tetragrammaton). A the Babe is pur sued by t he Dragon, w ho c asts a flood f rom his mouth to swallow it. See \"Rev.\" VII. The Dragon i s also the Mother --- the \"Evil Mother\" of Freud. I t is Harpocrates, threatened by t he cr ocodile in the Nile. We find the symbolism of the Ark, the Coffin of Osiris, e tc. The Lotus is the Yoni; the Water the Amniotic Fluid. I n or der to live his own life, the child must leave the Mother, and ove rcome the temptation to retu rn to he r for refuge. Kundr y, Armida, Jocasta, Circe, etc., are symbols of thi s force which tempts the Hero. H e may take her as his servant> when he has mas tered he r, so as to he al his father (Amfortas), avenge him (Osiris), or pacify him (Jehova h). But in or der to gr ow to manhood, he must cease to de pend on he r , earning the Lance (Parzival), claiming hi s arms (Achilles), or making hi s clu b (Hercules)>, and w ander in the waterless wilderness like Krishna, Jesus, Oedi pus, chi. tau. lambda. --- until the hour when, as the \"King's Son\" or knigh t-errant, he must win the Princess, and s et himself upon a strange throne. Alm ost all the legends of heroes imply this formula in strikingly similar symbols. Digamma. Vau the Sun - -- Son. H e is suppos ed to be mortal; but how is this shewn? It seems an absolute perversion of truth: the sacred symbols have no h int of it. This lie is the essence of the Great Sorcery. Osirian religion is a Freudian pha ntasy fashioned of man's dread of death and ignor ance of nature. The parthenoge nesis-idea {34} pe rsists, but is now the formula for incarnating demi-gods , or divine kings; these must be slain and r aised from the dead in on e way or another.> \"Aeon of Horus.\" Two sexes in one person. Digamma Iota Alpha Omicron D igamma: 93, t he full formula, recogni zing the Sun as the Son ( Star), as the pre-existent manifested Unit from which all springs and to which all returns.

This \"Devil\" is called Satan or Shaitan, and r egarded with ho rror by pe ople who a re ignor ant of his formula, and, i magining themselves to be evil, accuse Nature herself of their own pha ntasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, S et, Abrasax, Adad, Adoni s, Attis, Adam, Adona i, etc. The most serious charge a gainst him is that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient Initiates, {35} dw e lling a s they did in lands whose blood w as the water of the Nile or the Euphr at es, conne cted the South with life-withering he at, and c ursed that qua rter where the solar darts were deadliest. Even in the legend of Hiram, it is at high no on that he is stricken dow n and s lain. C apricornus is moreover the sign w hich the sun e nterers when he reaches his extreme Southern de clination a t the Winter Solstice, the season of the death of vegetation, f or the folk of the Northern hemisphere. This gave them a second c ause for cursing the south. A third; the tyranny of hot, dry, poi sonous winds; the menace of deserts or oceans dreadful because mysterious and impassable; these also were conne cted in their minds wi th the South. B ut to us , aware of astronom ical facts, this antagoni sm to the S outh is a silly superstition w hich the accidents of their local condi tions sugg ested to our animistic ancestors. We see no e nmity be tween Right and L eft, Up and D own, and s imilar pairs of oppos ites. These antitheses are real only as a statement of relation; they are the conve ntions of an arbitrary de vice for repr esenting our ideas in a pluralistic symbolism based on dua lity. \"Good\" must be defined in terms of hum an ideals and instincts. \"East\" has no m eaning e xcept with reference to the earth's internal affairs; as an absolute direction in spa ce it changes a degree every four minutes. \"Up\" is the same for no t wo men, un less one chance to be in the line joining the other with the centre of the eart h. \" Hard\" is the private opinion of our muscles. \"True\" is an utterly uni ntel ligible epithet which ha s proved refractory to the analysis of our ablest philo sophe rs. We have therefore no s cruple in restoring the \"devil-worship\" of such ideas as those which the laws of sound, a nd the phe nom ena of speech and he aring, c omp el us to conne ct with the group of \"Gods\" whose names are based upon S ht, or D, voc alized by t he free breath A. For these Names imply the qua lities of courag e, frankne ss, energy, pride, pow er and triumph; they are the words which expres s the creative and pa ternal will. Thus \"the Devil\" is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon t he loftiest mount ain s, the Godhe ad which, if it become manifest in man, m akes him Aegipan, the All. The Sun e nters this sign w hen he turns to renew the year in the North. H e i s also the vow el O, proper to roar, to boom , and {36} t o command, be ing a forci ble breath controlled by t he firm circle of the mouth. He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, be fore whom all shadow s flee away: al so that Secret Eye which makes an image of its God, t he Light, and gi ves it pow er to utter oracles, enlightening the mind. Thus, he is Man made God, e xalted, eager; he has come consciously to his full stature, and s o is ready to set out on hi s journey to redeem the world. B ut he may not appear in this true form; the Vision of Pan would dr ive men mad with f ear. He must conceal Himself in his original guise. He therefore becomes apparently the man that he was at the beginning; he lives the life of a man; indeed, he is wholly man. B ut his initiation ha s made him master of the Event by gi ving hi m the unde rstanding that whatever happens to hi m is the execution of this true will. Thus the last stage of his initiation is expressed in our formula as the final: Digamma --- The series of transformations has not affected his identity; but it has explained him to himself. Similarly, Coppe r is still Coppe r after Cu+O = CuO:+H SO =CuS O(H O):+K S=CuS(K SO ): 2 4 4 2 2 2 4 + blowpipe and r educing a gent = Cu(S). It is the same coppe r, but we have learnt some of its properties. We obs erv e especially that it is indestructible, inviolably itself throughout all its ad 30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ventures, and in all its disguises. We see moreover that it can onl y make use of its pow ers, fulfill the pos sibilities of its nature, and s atisfy its equatio ns, by t hus combining w ith its count erparts. Its existence as a separate subst ance is evidence of its subjection to stress; and this is felt as the ache of a n incomprehensible yearning unt il it realises that every experience is a relief , an expression of itself; and that it cannot be injured by a ught that may be fa ll it. In the Aeon of Osiris it was indeed realised that Man must die in or der to live. But now in the Aeon of Horus we know that every event is a death; su bject and obj ect slay each other in \"love unde r will\"; each such de ath is itsel f life, the means by w hich one realises one self in a series of episodes. The second m ain poi nt is the completion of the A babe Bacchus by t he O Pan ( Parzival wins the Lance, etc.). {37} The first process is to find the I in the V --- initiation, pur ification, f i nding the Secret Root of one self, the epicene Virgin who is 10 ( Malkuth) but sp elt in full 20 ( Jupiter). This Yod in the \"Virgin\" expands to the Babe in the Egg by f ormulating the S ecret Wisdom of Truth of Hermes in the Silence of the Fool. He acquires the Ey e-Wand, be holding the acting a nd be ing a dored. The Inverted Pentagram --- Baph omet --- the Hermaphrodite fully gr own --- begets himself on hi mself as V again . Note that there are now two sexes in one person throughout , so that each ind ividual is self-procreative sexually, whereas Isis kne w only one sex, and O siri s thought the two sexes oppos ed. Also the formula is now Love in all cases; an d the end is the beginning, on a higher plane. The I is formed from the V by r emoving its tail, the A by ba lancing 4 Yods, the O by m aking a n inverted triangle of Yods, which sugge sts the formula of Nui t --- Hadit --- Ra-Hoor-Khuit. A is the elements whirling a s a Svastika --- th e creative Energy in equilibrated action.>  - ------------- {38}  C HAPTER VI THE FORMULA OF THE NEOPHYTE>. This formula has for its \"first matter\" the ordinary man entirely ignor ant o f everything a nd incapable of anything. H e is therefore represented as blindfo lded and bound. H is only aid is his aspiration, r epresented by t he officer who is to lead him into the Temple. Before entering, he must be pur ified and c ons ecrated. O nce within the Temple, he is required to bind hi mself by a n oa th. H is aspiration is now formulated as Will. He makes the mystic circumambulation of the Temple for the reasons to be described in the Chapter on \" Gesture\". Aft er further pur ification a nd c onsecration, he is allowed for one moment to see t he Lord of the West, and ga ins courage> to pe rsist. For the third time he is p urified and c onsecrated, and he sees the Lord of the East, who hol ds the balanc e, keeping hi m in a straight line. In the West he gains energy. In the East h e is prevented from dissipating the same. So fortified, he may be received int o the Order as a neophyt e by t he three principal officers, thus uniting the Cro ss with the Triangle. He may then be placed be tween the pillars of the Temple, to receive the fourth and f inal consecration. I n this pos ition the secrets of the grade are communicated to him, and the last of his fetters is removed. Al l this is sealed by t he sacrament of the Four Elements. It will be seen that the effect of this whole ceremony i s to endow a thing i nert and impotent with ba lanced motion in a given direction. N umerous example of this formula are given {39} i n Equinox I , Nos. II and I II. It is the formul a of the Neophyt e Ceremony of G.'. D .'. It shoul d be employed in the consecrat 31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ion of the actual weapons used by t he magician, and m ay also be used as the fir st formula of initiation. In the book c alled Z 2> (Equinox I , III) are given full details of this form ula, which cannot be too c arefully studied and pr actised. I t is unf ortunately, the most complex of all of them. But this is the fault of the first matter of the work, w hich is so muddl ed that many ope rations are required to uni fy it.  - ----------- {40}  C HAPTER VII THE FORMULA OF THE HOLY GRAAL:  O F  ABRAHADABRA: \" and of certain other Words.\" Also: THE MAGICAL MEMORY. The Hieroglyph s hewn in the Seventh Key of the Tarot (described in the 12th Aethyr, Liber 418, E quinox I , V) is the Charioteer of OUR LADY BABALON, whose C up or Graal he hears. Now this is an important formula. It is the First of the Formulae, in a sen se, for it is the formula of Renunc iation.> It is also the Last! This Cup is said to be full of the Blood of the Saints; that is, every \"sain t\" or magician must give the last drop of his life's blood t o that cup. I t is the original price paid for magick pow er. And if by m agick pow er we mean the t rue pow er, the assimilation of all force with the Ultimate Light, the true Brid al of the Rosy Cross, then is that blood t he offering of Virginity, the sole sa crifice well-pleasing to the Master, the sacrifice whose only reward is the pai n of child-bearing unt o him. But \"to sell one 's soul to the devil\", to renounc e no m atter what for an equiv alent in pe rsonal gain>, is black magic. You a re no l onge r a nobl e giver of yo ur all, but a mean huc kster. {41} This formula is, how ever, a little different in symbolism, since it is a Wom an whose Cup m ust be filled. I t is rather the sacrifice of the Man, w ho transf ers life to his descendants. For a woman doe s not carry in he rself the princip le of new life, except temporarily, when it is given he r. But here the formula implies much more even than this. For it is his whole life that the Magus offers to OUR LADY. The Cross is both Death and G eneration , and it is on t he Cross that the Rose bloom s. The full significance of these symbols is so lofty that it is hardly fitted for an elementary treatise of this type. One must be an Exempt Adept, and ha ve become ready to pa ss on, be fore o ne can see the symbols even from the lower plane. Only a Master of the Temple can fully unde rstand them. (However, the reader may study L iber CLVI, in Equinox I , VI, the 12th and 2n d Aethyrs in Liber 418 i n Equinox I , V, and the Symbolism of the V Degree and V 32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"I Degree in O.T.O.) Of the preservation of this blood w hich OUR LADY offers to the ANCIENT ONE, CHAOS> the All-Father, to revive him, and of how his divine Essence fills the D aught er (the soul of Man) and pl aces her upon t he Throne of the Mother, fulfill ing the Econom y of the Universe, and thus ultimately rewarding the Magician (th e Son) ten thous andfold, it would be still more improper to speak in this place . So hol y a mystery is the Arcanum of the Masters of the Temple, that it is he re hinted at in or der to blind the presumptuous who m ay, unw orthy, seek to lift the veil, and a t the same time to lighten the darkness of such as may be requi ring onl y one ray of the Sun in or der to spring into life and light.  I I ABRAHADABRA is a word to be studied in Equinox I , V., \"The Temple of Solomon the King\". It represents the Great Work complete, and it is therefore an arch etype of all lesser magical ope rations. It is in a way too pe rfect to be appli ed in {42} a dvance to any of them. But an example of such an ope ration m ay be studied in Equinox I , VII, \"The Temple of Solomon the King\", where an invoc atio n of Horus on t his formula is given in full. Note the reverberation of the ide as one against another. The formula of Horus has not yet been so fully worked out in de tails as to justify a treatise upon i ts exoteric theory and pr actice; but one may say that it is, to the formula of Osiris, what the turbine is to th e reciprocating e ngine.  I II There are many ot her sacred words which enshrine formulae of great efficacit y in pa rticular ope rations. For example, V.I.T.R.I.O.L. gives a certain Regimen of the Planets useful in Alchemical work. Ararita is a formula of the macrocosm potent in certain ve ry lofty Operations of the Magick of the Inmost Light. (See Liber 813.) The formula of Thelema may be summarized thus: Theta \"Babalon a nd the Beast conjoined\" --- epsilon unt o Nuith (CCXX, I, 51) --- lambda The Work accomplishe d in Justice --- eta The Holy Graal --- mu The Water therein --- alpha The Babe in the Egg ( Harpocrates on t he Lotus.) That of \"Agape\" is as follows: Dionys us (Capital Alpha) --- The Virgin Earth ga mma --- The Babe in the Egg (small alpha --- the image of the Father) --- The Massacre of the Innoc ents, pi (winepress) --- The Draught of Ecstasy, eta. The student will find it well worth his while to seek out these ideas in de t ail, and de velop the technique of their application. There is also the Gnostic Name of the Seven Vowels, which gives a musical fo rmula most puissant in evocations of the Soul of Nature. There is moreover ABR AXAS; there is XNOUBIS; there is MEITHRAS; and indeed it may br iefly be stated that every true name of God gi ves the formula of the invoc ation of that God.> It would therefore be impossible, even were it desirable, to analyse all such n ames. The general method of doing s o ha s been {43} gi ven, and the magician mus t himself work out his own formula for particular cases.>  I V. It shoul d also be remarked that every gr ade has its peculiar magical formula . Thus, the formula of Abrahadabra concerns us, as men, pr incipally be cause ea ch of us represents the pentagram or microcosm; and our equilibration m ust ther efore be with the hexagram or macrocosm. In other words, 5 D egree = 6Square is the formula of the Solar ope ration; but then 6 D egree = 5Square is the formula of the Martial ope ration, a nd this reversal of the figures implies a very diff erent Work. I n the former instance the problem was to dissolve the microcosm i n the macrocosm; but this other problem is to separate a particular force from the macrocosm, just as a savage might hew out a flint axe from the deposits in 33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"a chalk cliff. Similarly, an ope ration of Jupiter will be of the nature of the equilibration of him with Venus. Its graphic formula will be 7 D egree = 4Squa re, and there will be a word in which the character of this ope ration is descri bed, just as Abrahadabra describes the Operation of the Great Work. It may be stated without unf airness, as a rough ge neral principle, that the farther from original equality are the two sides of the equation, t he more diff icult is the ope ration to pe rform. Thus, to take the case of the personal ope ration s ymbolized by t he grades, i t is harder to be come a Neophyt e, 1 D egree = 10S quare, than to pa ss from that g rade to Zelator, 2 D egree = 9Square. Initiation is, therefore, progressively easier, in a certain sense, after th e first step is taken. B ut (especially after the passing of Tiphareth) the dis tance between gr ade and gr ade increases as it were by a geometrical progression with an enormously high f actor, which itself progresses.> {44} It is evidently impossible to give details of all these formulae. Before be ginning a ny ope ration s oever the magician must make a through Q abalistic study of it so as to work out its theory in symmetry of perfection. P reparedness in Magick is as important as it is in War.  V It shoul d be profitable to make a somewhat detailed study of the strange-looki ng w ord AUMGN, for its analysis affords an excellent illustration of the princi ples on w hich the Practicus may construct his own Sacred Words. This word ha s been uttered by t he MASTER THERION himself, as a means of declar ing hi s own pe rsonal work as the Beast, the Logos of the Aeon. To unde rstand i t, we must make a preliminary consideration of the word which it replaces and f rom which it was developed: the word AUM. The word AUM is the sacred Hindu m antra which was the supreme hieroglyph of Truth, a compendium of the Sacred Know ledge. M any vol umes have been written wi th regard to it; but, for our present pur pose, it will be necessary onl y to exp lain how it came to serve for the representation of the principal philosophi cal tenets of the Rishis. {45} Firstly, it represents the complete course of sound. I t is pronounc ed by f o rcing the breath from the back of the throat with the mouth wide ope n, through the buc cal cavity with the lips so shaped as to modify the sound f rom A to O (o r U), to the closed lips, when it becomes M. Symbolically, this announc es the course of Nature as proceeding f rom free and f ormless creation through c ontroll ed and f ormed pr eservation to the silence of destruction. The three sounds are harmonized into one ; and thus the word represents the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, a nd S hiva; and the ope rations in the Universe of their triune energy. It is thus the formula of a Manvantara, or period of manifested existence, whi ch alternates with a Pralaya, dur ing w hich creation is latent. Analysed Qabalistically, the word is found t o pos sess similar properties. A is the negative, and a lso the unity which concentrates it into a pos itive form . A is the Holy Spirit who be gets God in flesh upon t he Virgin, according to t he formula familiar to students of \"The Golden Bough\" . A is also the \"babe in the Egg\" thus produc ed. The qua lity of A is thus bisexual. It is the original being - -- Zeus Arrhenothelus, Bacchus Diphue s, or Baphom et. U or V is the manifested son hi mself. Its num ber is 6. I t refers therefore , to the dua l nature of the Logos as divine and hum an; the interlacing of the u pright and a verse triangles in the hexagram. It is the first num ber of the Sun , whose last num ber> is 666, \" the num ber of a man\". The letter M exhibits the termination of this process. It is the Hanged M an of the Tarot; the formation of the individual from the absolute is closed by h is death. We see accordingly how AUM is, on e ither system, the expression of a dogm a w hich implies catastrophe in na ture. It is cogna te with the formula of the Slai n God. The \"resurrection\" and \" ascension\" are not implied in it.

To {46} t he Hindu, i n deed, they are still less respectable. in his view, existence is essentially o bjectionable>; and hi s principle concern is to invoke Shiva> to de stroy the ill usion w hose thrall is the curse of the Manvantara. The cardinal revelation of the Great Aeon of Horus is that this formula AUM does not represent the facts of nature. The point of view is based upon m isapp rehension of the character of existence. It soon be came obvi ous to The Master Therion that AUM was an inadequate and m isleading hi eroglyph. I t stated onl y p art of the truth, and it implied a funda mental falsehood. H e consequently de te rmined to modify the word in such a manner as to fit it to represent the Arcana unve iled by t he Aeon of which He had attained to be the Logos . The essential task was to emphasize the fact that nature is not catastrophi c, but proceeds by m eans of undul ations. It might be sugge sted that Manvantara an d Pralaya are in reality complementary curves; but the Hindu doc trine insists s trongl y on de nying c ontinuity to the successive pha ses. It was nevertheless im portant to avoid disturbing the Trinitarian arrangement of the word, as would b e done by t he addition of other letters. It was equally de sirable to make it c lear that the letter M represents an ope ration w hich doe s not actually oc cur in nature except as the withdrawal of phe nom ena into the absolute; which pr ocess, even when so unde rstood, i s not a true destruction, but , on t he contrary, the emancipation of anything f rom the modifications which it had mistaken for itsel f. It occurred to him that the true nature of Silence was to pe rmit the uninte rrupted vibration of the undul atory energy, free from the false conceptions att ached to it by t he Ahamkara or Ego-making f acility, whose assumption that consc ious individuality constitutes existence let it to consider its own apparently catastrophi c character as pertaining to the order of nature. {47} The undul atory formula of putrefaction is represented in the Qabalah by t he letter N, which refers to Scorpio, w hose triune nature combines the Eagle, Snak e and S corpion. These hieroglyphs themselves indicate the spiritual formulae o f incarnation. H e was also anxious to us e the letter G, another triune formula expressive of the aspects of the moon, w hich further declares the nature of hu man existence in the following m anner. The moon i s in itself a dark or b; but a n appearance of light is communicated to it by t he sun; and it is exactly in th is way that successive incarnations create the appearance, just as the individu al star, which every man is, remains itself, irrespective of whether earth pe rc eives it or not. Now it so ha ppens that the root GN signifies both know ledge and ge neration c ombined in a single idea, in an absolute form independent of personality. The G is a silent letter, as in our word Gnosis; and the sound G N is nasal, sugge st ing therefore the breath of life as oppos ed to that of speech. I mpelled by t he se considerations, the Master Therion pr opos ed to replace the M of AUM by a com pound l etter MGN, symbolizing thereby the subtle transformation of the apparent silence and de ath which terminates the manifested life of Vau by a continuous vibration of an impersonal energy of the nature of generation a nd know ledge, th e Virgin M oon a nd the Serpent furthermore ope rating to include in the idea a co mmemoration of the legend s o gr ossly de formed in the Hebrew legend of the Garde n of Eden, and its even more malignantly de based falsification in that bitterly sectarian br oadside, the Apocalypse. Sound w ork invariable vindicates itself by f urnishing c onfirmatory corollari es not contemplated by t he Qabalist. In the present instance, the Master Theri on w as delighted to remark that his compound l etter MGN, constructed on t heoret ical principles with the idea of incorporating the new know ledge of the Aeon, h ad the value of 93 ( M = 40, G = 3, N = 50) . 93 i s the num ber of the word of th e Law --- Thelema --- Will, and of Agape --- Love, which indicates the nature o f Will.

Finally, the total num eration of the Word AUMGN is 100, w hich, as initiates 35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the O.T.O.> are taught , expresses the unity u nder the form of complete manifestation by t he symbolism of pur e num ber, being Kether by Aiq Bkr>; also M alkuth multiplied by i tself>, and thus established in the phe nom enal universe.

Q oph i n the Tarot is \"the Moon\" , a card sugge sting illusion, ye t shewing count erpartal forces ope rating in da rkness, and the Winged Beetle or Midnight Sun in his Bark travelling through t he Nadir. Its Yetziratic attribution is Pi sces, symbolic of the pos itive and ne gative currents of fluidic energy, the mal e Ichthus or \"Pesce\" and the female Vesica, seeking r espectively the anode and kathode . The num ber 100 i s therefore a synthetic glyph of the subtle energies employed in creating the Illusion, or Reflection of Reality, which we call mani fested existence. The above are the principal considerations in the matter of AUMGN. They sho uld suffice to illustrate to the student the methods employed in the constructi on of the hieroglyphi cs of Magick, and to arm him with a mantra of terrific pow er by vi rtue whereof he may apprehend the Universe, and c ontrol in himself i ts Karmic consequences. {49}  VI  THE MAGICAL MEMORY.>  I There is no m ore important task than the exploration of one 's previous incarna tions>. As Zoroaster says: \"Explore the river of the soul; whence and in what order thou ha s come.\" One cannot do one 's True Will intelligently unl ess one kn ows what it is. Liber Thisarb, E quinox I , VII, give instructions for determini ng this by c alculating the resultant of the forces which ha ve made one what one is. But this practice is confined to one 's present incarnation. If one were to wake up i n a boa t on a strange river, it would be rash to con clude that the direction of the one reach visible was that of the whole stream. It would he lp ve ry much if one remembered the bearings of previous reaches tr aversed be fore one 's nap. I t would further relieve one 's anxiety when one beca me aware that a uniform and c onstant force was the single determinant of all th e findings of the stream: gravitation. We could rejoice \"that even the wearies t river winds somewhere safe to sea.\" Liber Thisarb de scribes a method of obtaining the Magical Memory by l earning t o remember backwards. But the careful {50} pr actice of Dharana is perhaps more generally us eful. As one prevents the more accessible thought s from arising, we strike deeper strata --- memories of childhood r eawaken. S till deeper lies a class of thought s whose origin puz zles us. Some of these apparently be long t o former incarnations. By cultivating these departments of one 's mind w e can d evelop them; we become expert; we form an or ganized coherence of these original ly disconne cted elements; the faculty gr ows with astonishing r apidity, onc e the kna ck of the bus iness is mastered. It is much easier (for obvi ous reasons) to acquire the Magical Memory when o ne has been sworn for many lives to reincarnate immediately. The great obs tacl e is the phe nom enon c alled Freudian forgetfulness; that is to say, that, though an unpl easant event may be recorded faithfully enough by t he mechanism of the brain, w e fail to recall it, or recall it wrong, be cause it is painful. \"The P sychopa thology of Everyday Life\" analyses and illustrates this phe nom enon i n de tail. Now, the King of Terrors being D eath, it is hard indeed to look i t in th e face. M ankind ha s created a hos t of pha ntastic masks; people talk of \"going to he aven\", \"passing ove r\", and s o on; banners flaunted from pasteboard towers 36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"of baseless theories. One instinctively flinches from remembering one 's last, as one doe s from imagining one 's next, death.> The point of view of the initia te helps one immensely. As soon a s one has passed this Pons Asinorum, the practice becomes much easier . It is much less troubl e to reach the life before the last; familiarity with death br eeds contempt for it. It is a very gr eat assistance to the beginner if he happens to ha ve some int ellectual grounds for identifying hi mself with some definite person in the imme diate past. A brief account of Aleister Crowley's good f ortune in this matter shoul d be instructive. It will be seen that the points of contact vary gr eatly in character. 1. The date of Eliphas Levi's death was about six months previous to that of Aleister Crowley's birth. The reincarnating e go is suppos ed to take pos sessio n of the foetus at about this stage of developm ent. {51} 2. E liphas Levi had a striking pe rsonal resemblance to Aleister Crowley's fa ther. This of course merely sugge sts a certain de gree of suitability from a ph ysical point of view. 3. Aleister Crowley wrote a play called \"The Fatal Force\" at a time when he had not read any of Eliphas Levi's works. The motive of this play is a Magical Operation of a very pe culiar kind. The formula which Aleister Crowley suppos e d to be his original idea is mentioned by L evi. We have not been able to trace it anyw here else with such exact corresponde nce in every de tail. 4. Aleister Crowley found a certain qua rter of Paris incomprehensibly famili ar and a ttractive to him. This was not the ordinary phe nom enon of the \"deja vu \", it was chiefly a sense of being a t hom e again. H e discovered long a fter tha t Levi had lived in the neighbour hood f or many ye ars. 5. There are many c urious similarities between the events of Eliphas Levi's life and that of Aleister Crowley. The intention of the parents that their son shoul d ha ve a religious career; the inability to make use of very remarkable t alents in any r egular way; the inexplicable ostracism which afflicted him, and whose authors seemed somehow to be ashamed of themselves; the events relative t o marriage>: all these offer surprisingly close parallels. 6. The characters of the two men pr esent subtle identities in many poi nts. Both seem to be constantly trying to reconcile insuperable antagoni sms. Both f ind it hard to de stroy the delusion that men's fixed be liefs and c ustoms may be radically altered by a few friendly explanations. Both show a curious fondne s s for out-the-way learning, pr eferring r econdi te sources of know ledge they adop t eccentric appearances. Both inspire what can onl y be called pa nic fear in ab solute strangers, who c an give no r eason w hatever for a repulsion w hich sometim es almost amount s to {52} t emporary insanity. The ruling pa ssion in each case is that of helping hum anity. Both show quixotic disregard of their personal pr osperity, and e ven comfort, yet both display love of luxur y and s plendour . Bot h ha ve the pride of Satan. 7. When Aleister Crowley be came Frater Omicron-Upsilon M u-Eta and ha d to wr ite his thesis for the grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he had already c ollected his ideas when Levi's \"Clef des Grands Mysteres\" fell into his hands. It was remar kable that he, having a dmired Levi for many ye ars, and e ven be gun t o suspect th e identity, had not troubl ed (although a n extravagant buye r of books ) to ge t th is particular work. H e found, t o his astonishment, that almost everything that he had himself intended to say was there written. The result of this was that he abandone d writing hi s original work, and instead translated the masterpiece in que stion. 8. The style of the two men is strikingly similar in num erous subtle and de e p-seated ways. The general point of view is almost identical. The qua lity of the irony i s the same. Both take a perverse pleasure in playing pr actical joke s on t he reader. In one point, above all, the identity is absolute --- there i s no t hird na me in literature which can be put in the same class. The point is this: In a single sentence is combined sublimity and e nthusiasm with sneering bitterness, scepticism, grossness and s corn. I t is evidently the supreme enjoy 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"ment to strike a chord composed of as many c onflicting e lements as pos sible. T he pleasure seems to be derived from gratifying the sense of pow er, the pow er t o compel every pos sible element of thought to contribute to the spasm. If the theory of reincarnation w ere generally accepted, the above considerat ions would make out a strong c ase. FRATER PERDURABO was quite convi nced in one part of his mind of this identity, long be fore he got any a ctual memories as s uch.>  I I Unless one has a groundw ork of this sort to start with, one must get back to one 's life as best one can by t he methods above indicated. {53} I t may be of some assistance to give a few characteristics of genuine Magical Memory; to men tion a few sources of error, and to lay dow n critical rules for the verificatio n of one 's results. The first great danger arises from vanity. One shoul d always beware of \"rem embering\" that one was Cleopatra or Shakespeare. Again, superficial resemblances are usually misleading. One of the great tests of the genuineness of any r ecollection is that one re members the really important things in one 's life, not those which mankind c omm only classes as such. F or instance, Aleister Crowley doe s not remember any of the decisive events in the life of Eliphas Levi. He recalls intimate trivialit ies of childhood. H e has a vivid recollection of certain spiritual crises; in particular, one which was fought out as he paced up a nd dow n a lonely stretch o f road in a flat and de solate district. He remembers ridiculous incidents, suc h as often ha ppen at suppe rs when the conve rsation takes a turn such that its g aiety somehow strikes to the soul, and one receives a supreme revelation w hich is yet perfectly inarticulate. He has forgotten his marriage and its tragic re sults>, although t he plagiarism which Fate has been shameless enough t o pe rpetr ate in this present life, would na turally, one might think, r eopen the wound. There is a sense which assures us intuitively when we are runni ng on a scent breast high. There is an \"oddne ss\" about the memory which is somehow annoyi ng . It gives a feeling of shame and gui ltiness. There is a tendency to blush. One feels like a school boy c aught red-handed in the act of writing poe try. The re is the same sort of feeling a s one has when one finds a faded phot ograph or a lock of hair twenty ye ars old among t he rubbi sh in some forgotten cabinet. T his feeling is independent of the que stion w hether the thing r emembered was in itself a source of pleasure or of pain. C an it be that we resent the idea of o ur \"previous condi tion of servitude\"? We want to forget the past, how ever good reason w e may ha ve to be proud of it. It is well know n that many m en are emba rrassed in the presence of a monke y. {54} When the \"loss of face\" doe s not occur, distrust the accuracy of the item wh ich you r ecall, The only reliable recollections which pr esent themselves with serenity are invariably conne cted with what men call disasters. Instead of the feeling of being c aught in the slips, one has that of being m issed at the wick et. One has the sly satisfaction of having done an out rageously foolish thing and got off scot free. When one sees life in pe rspective, it is an immense rel ief to discover that things like bankruptcy, wedlock, and the gallows made no p articular difference. They were only accidents such as might happen to anybody ; they ha d no r eal bearing on t he point at issue. One consequently remembers h aving one 's ears croppe d as a lucky e scape, while the causal jest of a drunke n skeinsmate in an all-night cafe stings one with the shame of the parvenu to who m a polite stranger has uns uspectingly mentioned \"Mine Uncle\". The testimony of intuitions is, how ever, strictly subjective, and s hrieks fo r collateral security. It would be a great error to ask too m uch. I n conseque nce of the peculiar character of the recollections which are unde r the microsco pe, anything in the shape of gross confirmation a lmost presumes perjury. A pat hologist would arouse suspicion if he said that his bacilli had arranged themse lves on t he slide so as to spell Staphyl ococcus. We distrust an arrangement of flowers which tells us that \"Life is worth living in Detroit, Michigan\". Supp 38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ose that Aleister Crowley remembers that he was Sir Edward Kelly. It doe s not follow that he will be able to give us details of Cracow in the time of James I of England. M aterial events are the words of an arbitrary langua ge; the symbo ls of a cipher previously agreed on. What happened to Kelly in Cracow may ha ve meant something to him, but there is no r eason to pr esume that it has any m ean ing f or his successor. There is an obvi ous line of criticism about any r ecollection. I t must not c lash with ascertained facts. For example --- one cannot have two lives which o verlap, unl ess there is reason to suppos e that the earlier died spiritually be f ore his body c eased to br eathe. This might happen in certain cases, such as in sanity. It is not conclusive against a previous incarnation that the present shoul d be inferior to the past. One's life may represent the full pos sibilities of a certain pa rtial Karma. One may ha ve {55} de voted one 's incarnation to discharg ing the liabilities of one part of one 's previous character. For instance, one might devote a lifetime to settling the bill run up by N apoleon f or causing un necessary suffering, w ith the object of starting a fresh, clear of debt, in a li fe devoted to reaping the reward of the Corsican's invaluable services to the r ace. The Master Therion, i n fact, remembers several incarnations of almost unc omp ensated wretchedness, angui sh and hum iliation, vol untarily unde rtaken so that he might resume his work unha mpered by s piritual creditors. These are the stigmata. M emory is hall-marked by i ts corresponde nce with th e facts actually obs erved in the present. This corresponde nce may be of two ki nds. It is rare (and it is unimportant for the reasons stated above ) that one ' s memory shoul d be confirmed by w hat may be called, contemptuous ly, external ev idence. It was indeed a reliable contribution to ps ychology t o remark that an evil and a dulterous generation s ought for a sign. (Even so, the permanent value of the obs ervation is to trace the genealogy o f the Pharisee --- from Caiaphas to the modern Christian.) Signs mislead, from \"Painless Dentistry\" upw ards. The fact that anything is intelligible proves that it is addressed to the wrong qua rter, because the ver y existence of langua ge presuppos es impotence to communicate directly. When Wa lter Raleigh f lung hi s cloak upon t he muddy r oad, he merely expressed, in a cip her contrived by a combination of circumstances, his otherwise inexpressible wi sh to ge t on good t erms with Queen Elizabeth. The significance of his action w as determined by t he concourse of circumstances. The reality can ha ve no r easo n for reproduc ing itself exclusively in that especial form. It can ha ve no r ea son f or remembering that so extravagant a ritual happened to be necessary to wo rship. Therefore, how ever well a man might remember his incarnation a s Julius Caesar, there is no ne cessity for his representing hi s pow er to set all upon t h e hazard of a die by i magining the Rubicon. Any s piritual state can be symboli zed by a n infinite variety of actions in an infinite variety of circumstances. One shoul d recollect only those events which ha ppen to {56} be immediately lin ked with one 's peculiar tendencies to imagine one thing r ather than another.> Genuine recollections almost invariably explain one self to one self. Suppos e , for example, that you f eel an instinctive aversion to some particular kind of wine. Try as you w ill, you c an find no r eason f or your idiosyncrasy. Suppos e , then, that when you e xplore some previous incarnation, you r emember that you died by a poison a dministered in a wine of that character, your aversion is exp lained by t he proverb, \"A bur nt child dr eads the fire.\" It may be objected tha t in such a case your libido ha s created a pha ntasm of itself in the manner whi ch Freud ha s explained. The criticism is just, but its value is reduced if it shoul d ha ppen that you w ere not aware of its existence until your Magical Memor y attracted your attention to it. In fact, the essence of the test consists in this: that your memory not ifies you of something w hich is the logical conclusi on of the premisses pos tulated by t he past. As an example, we may cite certain memories of the Master Therion. H e follo 39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"wed a train of thought which led him to remember his life as a Roman na med M ari us de Aquila.

But a subsequent examination of the reco rd show s that the logical result of the Work of Marius de Aquila did not occur to that romantic reprobate; in poi nt of fact, he died be fore anything c ould ha p pen. C an we suppos e that any c ause can be baulked of effect? The Universe is unanimous in rebuttal. If then the exact effects which might be expected to re sult from these causes are manifested in the career {57} of the Master Therion, it is assuredly the easiest and m ost reasonable explanation to assume an ident ity be tween the two men. N obody i s shocked to obs erve that the ambition of Nap oleon ha s diminished the average stature of Frenchmen. We know that somehow or other every force must find its fulfilment; and those people who ha ve grasped the fact that external events are merely symptoms of external ideas, cannot fin d any di fficulty in attributing the corresponde nces of the one to the identitie s of the other. Far be it from any a pologist for Magick to insist upon t he objective validit y of these concatenations! It would be childish to cling to the belief that Ma rius de Aquila actually existed; it matters no m ore that it matters to the math ematician whether the use of the symbol X to the 22 pow er invol ves the \"realit y\" of 22 di mension of space. The Master Therion doe s not care a scrap of yeste rday's newspaper whether he was Marius de Aquila, or whether there ever was suc h a person, or whether the Universe itself is anything m ore than a nightmare cr eated by hi s own imprudence in the matter of rum and w ater. His memory of Mari us de Aquila, of the adventures of that person in Rome and the Black Forest, ma tters nothing, e ither to him or to anybody e lse. What matters is this: True or false, he has found a symbolic form which ha s enabled him to gove rn himself to the best advantage. \"Quantum nobi s prodest hec fabula Christi!\" The \"falsity\" of Aesop's Fables doe s not diminish their value to mankind. The above reduction of the Magical Memory to a device for externalizing one 's interior wisdom need not be regarded as sceptical, save only in the last resort . No scientific hypot hesis can adduc e stronge r evidence of its validity than t he confirmation of its predictions by e xperimental evidence. The objective can always be expressed in subjective symbols if necessary. The controversy is ul timately unm eaning. H owever we interpret the evidence, its relative truth de pe nds in its internal coherence. We may therefore say that any m agical recollect ion is genuine if it gives the explanation of our external or internal condi tio ns. Anything w hich throws light upon t he Universe, anything w hich reveals us t o our selves, shoul d be welcome in this world of riddles. As our record extends into the past, the evidence of its truth is cumulative . Every incarnation that we remember must increase {58} our comprehension of o urselves as we are. Each accession of know ledge must indicate with unm istakabl e accuracy the solution of some enigma which is propounde d by t he Sphynx of our own unknow n birth-city, Thebes. The complicated situation in which we find ou rselves is composed of elements; and no e lement of it came out of nothing. N ew ton's First Law applies to every plane of thought . The theory of evolution is omniform. There is a reason f or one 's predisposition to gout , or the shape of one's ear, in the past. The symbolism may change; the facts do not . In one fo rm or another, everything that exists is derived from some previous manifestati on. H ave it, if you w ill, that the memories of other incarnations are dreams; but dreams are determined by r eality just as much as the events of the day. Th e truth is to be apprehended by t he correct translation of the symbolic langua g e.

In or der to make the knife, he would require a hundr ed other things, the acquisition of each of which might require a hundr ed more; and s o on.

H e will have learnt a lot of useful things in his attempt to make a r eally virgin sword; he will unde rstand how one thing de pends upon a nother; he w ill begin to appreciate the meaning of the words \"the harmony of the Universe\", so of ten us ed so stupidly and s uperficially by t he ordinary apologist for Natu re, and he will also pe rceive the true ope ration of the law of Karma.> Another notable injunction of the ancient Magick was that whatever appertained to the Work shoul d be \"single\". The Wand w as to be cut with a single stroke o f the knife. There must be no {63} boggl ing a nd ha cking a t things, no c lumsine ss and no he sitation.

They take up t he magic al path without sufficient reflection, w ithout that determination of adamant wh ich made the author of this book e xclaim, as he took t he first oath, \"PERDURABO \" --- \"I will endur e unto the end!\"> They start on i t at a great pace, and the n find that their boot s are covered with mud.

Another recommendation w as this: buy w hatever may be necessary without haggl ing! You m ust not try to strike a propor tion be tween the values of incommensurabl e things.> The least of the Magical Instruments is worth infinitely more than all that you pos sess, or if you l ike, than all that you s tupidly suppos e your se lf to pos sess. Break this rule, and the usual Nemesis of the half-hearted awai ts you.

This command a nd this promise have been given by a ll the Magi without exception. And w here this command ha s been obe yed, this pr omise has been most certainly fulfilled.  I II In all actions the same formulae are applicable. To invoke a god, i .e. to r aise your self to that godhe ad, the process is threefold, PURIFICATION, CONSECRA TION and I NITIATION. Therefore every magical weapon, a nd e ven the furniture of the Temple, must b e passed through t his threefold regimen. The details only va ry on i nessential points. E.G. to pr epare the magician, he pur ifies himself by m aintaining hi s c hastity> and a bstaining f rom any de filement. But to do t he same with, let us s ay, the Cup, w e assure our selves that the metal has never been employed for any other pur pose --- we smelt virgin or e, and w e take all pos sible pains in refin ing the metal --- it must be chemically pur e. To sum up t his whole matter in a phr ase, every article employed is treated as if it were a candidate for initiation; but in those parts of the ritual in whic h the candidate is blindfolded, w e wrap the weapon i n a black cloth>. The oath which he takes is replaced by a \"charge\" in similar terms. The details of the preparation of each weapon s houl d be thought out carefully by t he magician. { 65} Further, the attitude of the magician to his weapons shoul d be that of the G od to the suppl iant who invoke s Him. It shoul d be the love of the father for h is child, the tenderness and c are of the bridegroom for his bride, and that pec uliar feeling w hich the creator of every work of art feels for his masterpiece. Where this is clearly unde rstood, t he magician will find no di fficulty in obs e rving the proper ritual, not only in the actual ceremonial consecration of each weapon, but in the actual preparation, a process which shoul d adum brate this c eremony; e.g., t he magician will cut the wand f rom the tree, will strip it of l eaves and twigs, will remove the bark. H e will trim the ends nearly, and s moot h dow n the knot s: --- this is the banishing. He will then rub it with the consecrated oil until it becomes smooth and gl i stening a nd gol den. H e will then wrap it in silk of the appropriate colour: -- - this is the Consecration. He will then take it, and imagine that it is that hollow tube in which Prome theus brought dow n fire from heaven, formulating to himself the passing of the Holy Influence through i t. In this and ot her ways he will perform the initiati on; and, t his being a ccomplished, he will repeat the whole process in an elabor ate ceremony.> To take an entirely different case, that of the Circle; the magician will sy nthesize the Vermilion r equired from Mercury an Sulphur which he has himself su blimated. This pur e {66} ve rmilion he will himself mix with the consecrated oi l, and a s he uses this paint he will think intently and w ith de votion of the sy mbols which he draws. This circle may then be initiated by a circumambulation, dur ing w hich the magician invoke s the names of God that are on i t. Any pe rson w ithout sufficient ingenuity to de vise proper methods of preparat ion f or the other articles required is unlikely to make much of a magician; and we shall only waste space if we deal in de tail with the preparation of each in strument.

It is found by e xperience (confirming the statement of Zoroaster) that the m ost potent conjurations are those in an ancient and pe rhaps forgotten langua ge, or even those couched in a corrupt and pos sibly always meaningless jargon. O f these there are several main types. The \"preliminary invoc ation\" in the \"Goet ia\" consists principally of corruptions of Greek and E gypt ian na mes. For examp le, we find \" Osorronnophr is\" for \"Asor Un-Nefer\".> The conjurations given by D r. Dee (vide Equinox I , VIII) are in a langua ge called Angelic, or Enochian. I ts source has hitherto ba ffled research, but it is a langua ge and not a jargon, for it pos sesses a structure of its own, and there are traces of grammar and s yntax. However this may be , it \"works\". Even the beginner finds that \"things happe n\" when he uses it: and this is an advantage --- or disadvantage! ---- shared b y no ot her type of langua ge,. The rest need skill. This needs Prudence! The Egypt ian Invoc ations are much pur er, but their meaning ha s not been suff iciently studied by pe rsons magically competent. We pos sess a num ber of Invoc a tions in Greek of every de gree of excellence; in Latin but few, and those of in ferior qua lity. It will be noticed that in every case the conjurations are ver y sonor ous, {68} a nd there is a certain magical voice in which they shoul d be r ecited. This special voice was a natural gift of the Master Therion; but it ca n be easily taught --- to the right people. Various considerations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the English l angua ge. There already e xisted one example, the charm of the witches in M acbet h; although t his was perhaps not meant seriously, its effect is indubi table.> He has found i ambic tetrameters enriched with many r imes both internal an exte rnal very us eful. \"The Wizard Way\" (Equinox I ,I) gives a good i dea of the sort of thing. S o doe s the Evocation of Bartzabel in Equinox I ,IX. There are many extant invoc ations throughout his works, in many ki nds of metre, of many ki nds of being, a nd f or many ki nds of pur poses. (See Appendix). Other methods of incantation a re on r ecord as efficacious. For instance Fra ter I.A., when a child, w as told that he could invoke the devil by r epeating th e \"Lord's Prayer\" backwards. He went into the garden and di d so. The Devil ap peared, and a lmost scared him out of his life. It is therefore not quite certain in what the efficacy of conjurations really lies. The peculiar mental excitement required may even be aroused by t he perce ption of the absurdity of the process, and the persistence in it, as when onc e FRATER PERDURABO (at the end of His magical resources) recited \"From Greenland' s Icy M ount ains\", and obt ained His result.> It may be conceded in any c ase that the long s trings of formidable words whi ch roar and m oan through s o many c onjurations have a real effect in exalting th e consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch --- that they shoul d do s o is no m ore extraordinary than music of any ki nd s houl d do s o. 44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" Magicians have not confined themselves to the use of the hum an voi ce. The Pan -pipe with its seven stops, correspondi ng to the seven planets, the bull-roarer , the tom-tom, and e ven the violin, ha ve all been us ed, as well as many ot hers, of which the {69} m ost important is the bell>, though t his is used not so much for actual conjuration a s to mark stages in the ceremony. Of all these the to m-tom will be found t o be the most generally us eful. While on t he subject of barbarous names of evocation w e shoul d not omit the utterance of certain supreme words which enshrine (alpha) the complete formula of the God invoke d, or (beta) the whole ceremony. Examples of the former kind a re Tetragrammaton, I .A.O., and Abrahadabra. An example of the latter kind is the great word StiBeTTChePhMeFSHiSS, which is a line drawn on t he Tree of Life (Coptic attributions) in a certain manner.> With all such words it is of the utmost importance that they shoul d ne ver be spoke n unt il the supreme moment, and e ven then they shoul d bur st from the magi cian almost despite himself --- so gr eat shoul d be his reluctance> to utter the m. In fact, they shoul d be the utterance of the God in him at the first ons et of the divine pos session. S o uttered, they cannot fail of effect, for they ha v e become the effect. Every wise magician will have constructed (according to the principles of th e Holy Qabalah) many s uch words, and he shoul d ha ve quintessentialised them all in one Word, w hich last Word, onc e he has formed it, he shoul d ne ver utter con sciously even in thought , unt il perhaps with it he gives up t he ghos t. Such a Word shoul d in fact be so pot ent that man cannot hear it and live. {70} Such a word was indeed the lost Tetragrammaton> . It is said that at the utt erance of this name the Universe crashes into dissolution. L et the Magician ea rnestly seek this Lost Word, for its pronunc iation is synonym ous with the accom plishment of the Great Work.> In this matter of the efficacity of words there are again two formulae exactly oppos ite in na ture. A word may be come potent and terrible by vi rtue of consta nt repetition. I t is in this way that most religions gain strength. At first the statement \"So and s o is God\" excites no i nterest. Continue, and you m eet s corn and s cepticism: pos sibly pe rsecution. C ontinue, and the controversy ha s s o far died out that no one troubl es to contradict your assertion. No superstition is so da ngerous and s o lively as an exploded superstition. The newspapers of to-day (written and e dited almost exclusively by m en without a spark of either religion or morality) dare not hint that any one disbelieves in the ostensibly pr evailing c ult; they de plore Atheism --- all but universal i n pr actice and implicit in the theory of practically all intelligent people --- as if it were the eccentricity of a few negligible or objectionable persons. This is the ordinary story of advertisement; the sham has exactly the same chan ce as the real. Persistence is the only qua lity required for success. The oppos ite formula is that of secrecy. An idea is perpetuated be cause it must never be mentioned. A freemason ne ver forgets the secret words entrusted to him, thought these words mean absolutely not hing to him, in the vast majorit y of cases; the only reason f or this is that he has been forbidden to mention t hem, although t hey ha ve been publ ished again and a gain, and a re as accessible t o the profane as to the initiate. In such a work of practical Magick as the preaching of a new {71} L aw, these methods may be advantageously combined; on t he one hand infinite frankne ss and readiness to communicate all secrets; on t he other the sublime and terrible kn owledge that all real secrets are incommunicable.> It is, according to tradition, a certain advantage in conjurations to employ more than one langua ge. In all probability the reason of this is than any c ha nge spurs the flagging a ttention. A man engaged in intense mental labour will frequently stop a nd w alk up a nd dow n the room --- one may suppos e for this caus e --- but it is a sign of weakness that this shoul d be necessary. For the begi nner in M agick, how ever, it is permissible> to employ a ny de vice to secure the result.

At first he w ill find that the exaltation de stroys memory and pa ralyses muscle. This is an essential difficulty of the magical process, and c an onl y be ove rcome by pr acti ce and e xperience.> In or der to aid concentration, a nd to increase the suppl y of Energy, it has been customary for the Magician to employ a ssistants or colleagues. It is doub tful whether the obvi ous advantages of this plan compensate the difficulty of p rocuring s uitable persons>, and the chance of a conflict of will or a misunde rs tanding in the circle itself. On one occasion F RATER PERDURABO was disobeyed b y an assistant, and ha d it not been for His promptitude in us ing the phys ical c ompulsion of the sword, it is probable that the circle would ha ve been br oken. As it was, the affair fortunately terminated in not hing m ore serious than the destruction of the culprit. However, there is no doubt that an assemblage of persons who r eally are in h armony c an much more easily pr oduc e an effect than a magician working by hi msel f. The psychology of \"Revival meetings\" will be familiar to almost every one , and though s uch {73} m eetings> are the foulest and m ost degraded rituals of bla ck magic, the laws of Magick are not thereby s uspended. The laws of Magick are the laws of Nature. A singul ar and w orld-famous example of this is of sufficiently recent date t o be fresh in the memory of many pe ople now living. At a nigger camp meeting i n the \"United\" States of America, devotees were worked up t o such a pitch of ex citement that the whole assembly de veloped a furious form of hys teria. The com paratively intelligible cries of \"Glory\" and \" Hallelujah\" no l onge r expressed t he situation. S omebody s creamed out \"Ta-ra-ra-boom -de-ay!\", and this was taken up by t he whole meeting a nd ye lled continuous ly, unt il reaction s et in. The a ffair got into the papers, and s ome particularly br ight disciple of John S tuart Mill, logician and e conom ist, thought that these words, having s et one set of fools crazy, might do t he same to all the other fools in the world. H e accordi ngly wrote a song, a nd pr oduc ed the desired result. This is the most notorious example of recent times of the pow er exerted by a barbarous name of evocation. A few words may be useful to reconcile the general notion of Causality with that of Magick. H ow can we be sure that a person w aving a stick and how ling th ereby pr oduc es thunde rstorms? In no ot her way than that familiar to Science; w e note that whenever we put a lighted match to dr y gunpow der, an uni ntelligibly arbitrary phe nom enon, t hat of sound, i s obs erved; and s o forth. We need not dwell upon t his point; but it seems worth while to answer one of the objections to the pos sibility of Magick, chosing one which is at first sig ht of an obvi ously \"fatal\" character. It is conve nient to quot e verbatim from the Diary> of a distingui shed M agician and phi losophe r. \"I have noticed that the effect of a Magical Work ha s followed {74} i t so cl osely that it must have been started be fore the time of the Work. E .g. I work to-night to make X in Paris write to me. I get the letter the next morning, s o that it must have been written be fore the Work. D oes this deny that the Work caused the effect? \"If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, bot h my will and its motion a re d ue to causes long a ntecedent to the act. I may consider both my Work and its r 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"eaction a s twin effects of the eternal Universe. The moved arm and ba ll are pa rts of a state of the Cosmos which resulted ne cessarily from its momentarily pr evious state, and s o, ba ck for ever. \"Thus, my M agical Work is only one of the cause-effects necessarily concomit ant with the case-effects which set the ball in motion. I may therefore regard the act of striking a s a cause-effect of my or iginal Will to move the ball, th ough ne cessarily pr evious to its motion. B ut the case of magical Work is not q uite analogous . For my na ture is such that I am compelled to pe rform Magick in order to make my will to pr evail; so that the cause of my doi ng the Work is al so the cause of the ball's motion, a nd there is no r eason w hy one shoul d pr eced e the other. (CF. \"Lewis Carroll,\" where the Red Queen screams before she pric ks her finger.) \"Let me illustrate the theory by a n actual example. \"I write from Italy to a man in France and a nother in Australia on t he same day, telling them to join me. Both arrive ten da ys later; the first in answer to my letter, which he received, the second on \" his own initiative\", as it woul d seem. But I summoned him because I wanted him; and I wanted him because he w as my representative; and hi s intelligence made him resolve to join me because it judge d rightly that the situation ( so far as he kne w it) was such as to make me desire his presence. \"The same cause, therefore, which made me write to him made him come to me; and though i t would be improper to say that the writing of the letter was the d irect cause of his arrival, it is evident that if I had not written I shoul d ha ve been different from what I actually am, and therefore my relations with him would ha ve been otherwise than they are. In this sense, therefore, the letter and the journey are causally conne cted. \"One cannot go f arther, and s ay that in this case I ought to write the lette r even if he had arrived be fore I did so; for it {75} i s part of the whole set of circumstance that I do not use a crowbar on a n ope n door . \"The conclusion is that one shoul d do one 's Will 'without lust of result'. If one is working in accordance with the laws of one 's own na ture, one is doing 'right'; and no s uch work can be criticised as 'useless', even in cases of the character here discussed. S o long a s one 's Will prevails, there is no c ause f or complaint. \"To abandon one 's Magick would shew lack of self-confidence in one 's pow ers, and doubt as to one 's inmost faith in Self and in Nature.> Of course one chan ges one 's methods as experience indicates; but there is no ne ed to change them on a ny s uch gr ound a s the above . \"Further, the argum ent here set forth disposes of the need to explain the \"m odus ope randi\" of Magick. A successful ope ration doe s not invol ve any theory s oever, not even that of the existence of causality itself. The whole set of ph enom ena may be conceived as single. \"For instance, if I see a star (as it was years ago) I need not assume causa l relations as existing be tween it, the earth, and m yself. The conne xion e xist s; I can pr edicate nothing be yond t hat. I cannot pos tulate pur pose, or even de termine the manner in which the event comes to be . Similarly, when I do M agick , it is in va in to inqui re why I so act, or why the desired result doe s or doe s not follow. Nor can I know how the previous and s ubsequent condi tions are con nected. At most I can de scribe the consciousness which I interpret as a pictur e of the facts, and m ake empirical generalizations of the superficial aspects o f the case. \"Thus, I have my ow n pe rsonal impressions of the act of telephoni ng; but I can not be aware of what consciousness, electricity, mechanics, sound, e tc., actual ly are in themselves. And a lthough I can appeal to experience to lay dow n 'law s' as to what {76} c ondi tions accompany the act, I can ne ver be sure that they have always been, or ever will again be , identical. (In fact, it is certain th at an event can ne ver occur twice in pr ecisely the same circumstances.)> \"Further, my 'laws; must always take nearly all the more important elements of know ledge for granted.

For example, it was formerly suppos ed that Hydrogen and C hlorine would uni te when an electric spark was passed through t he mixture; now we 'know ' that the presence of a minute qua ntity of aqueous vapou r (or some tertium quid) is essential to the reaction. We formulated be fore th e days of Ross the 'laws' of malarial fever, without reference to the mosquito; we might discover one day that the germ is only active when certain events are transpiring in some nebula>, or when so apparently inert a substance as Argon is present in the air in certain pr opor tions. \"We may therefore admit quite cheerfully that Magick is as mysterious as mat hematics, as empirical as poe try, as unc ertain as golf, and a s dependent on t he personal equation a s Love. \"That is no r eason w hy w e shoul d not study, practice and e njoy it; for it is a Science in exactly the same sense as biology; it is no l ess an Art that Scul pture; and it is a Sport as much as Mount aineering. \"Indeed, there seems to be no undue presumption in ur ging that no S cience po ssesses equal pos sibilities of deep and important Know ledge;>that no Art offers such oppor tunities to the ambition {77} of the Soul to express its Truth, in E cstasy, through B eauty; and that no S port rivals its fascinations of danger and delight, so excites, exercises, and tests its devotees to the uttermost, or so rewards them by w ell-being, pr ide, and the passionate pleasures of personal tr iumph. \"Magick takes every thought and a ct for its apparatus; it has the Universe f or its Library and its Laboratory; all Nature is its Subject; and its Game, fre e from close seasons and pr otective restrictions, always abounds in infinite va riety, being a ll that exists.> {78}  C HAPTER X  O F THE GESTURES This chapter may be divided into the following pa rts: 1. Attitudes. 2. C ircumambulations (and s imilar movements). 3. C hanges of pos ition ( This depends upon t he theory of the construction of the circle). 4. The Knocks or Knells.  I Attitudes are of two Kinds: natural and a rtificial. Of the first kind, pr os tration is the obvi ous example. It comes natural to man (poor creature!) to th row himself to the ground i n the presence of the object of his adoration.> Intermediate between this and the pur ely artificial form of gesture comes a class which de pends on a cquired ha bit. Thus it is natural to an European of fic er to of fer his sword in token of surrender. A Tibetan would, how ever, squat, put out his tongue , and pl ace his hand be hind hi s right ear. Purely artificial gestures comprehend in their class the majority of definit ely magick signs, though s ome of these simulate a natural action - -- e.g. the s 48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"ign of the Rending of the Veil. But the sign of Auramoth (see Equinox I , II, I llustration \" The Signs of the Grades\") merely imitates a hieroglyph w hich ha s o nly a remote conne ction w ith any f act in na ture. All signs must of course be s tudied with infinite patience, and pr actised unt il the conne ction {79} be tween them and the mental attitude which they represent appears \"necessary.\"  I I The principal movement in the circle is circumambulation.> This has a very definite result, but one which is very difficult to de scribe. An analogy i s th e dyna mo. C ircumambulation pr operly pe rformed in combination w ith the Sign of Horus (or \"The Enterer\") on pa ssing the East is one of the best methods of arou sing the macrocosmic force in the Circle. It shoul d ne ver be omitted unl ess th ere be some special reason a gainst it. A particular tread seems appropriate to it. This tread shoul d be light and stealthy, almost furtive, and ye t very pur poseful. It is the pace of the tiger who s talks the deer. The num ber of circumambulations shoul d of course correspond t o the nature of the ceremony. Another important movement is the spiral, of which there are two pr incipal f orms, one inward, one outward. They can be performed in either direction; and, like the circumambulation, i f performed de osil> they invoke --- if widdershins > they ba nish>. In the spiral the tread is light and tripping, a lmost approxim ating to a dance: while performing it the magician will usually turn on hi s own axis, either in the same direction a s {80} t he spiral, or in the oppos ite dire ction. E ach combination invol ves a different symbolism. There is also the dance proper; it has many di fferent forms, each God ha ving his special dance. One of the easiest and m ost effective dances is the ordina ry waltz-step combined with the three signs of L.V.X. It is much easier to att ain ecstasy in this way than is generally suppos ed. The essence of the process consists in the struggl e of the Will against giddiness; but this struggl e must be prolonge d and s evere, and upon t he degree of this the qua lity and intensity of ecstasy attained may de pend. With pr actice, giddiness is altogether conque red; exhaustion then takes its place and the enemy of Will. It is through t he mutual destruction of these ant agoni sms in the mental and m oral being of the magician that Samadhi is begotten .  I II Good e xamples of the use of change of pos ition a re given in the manuscripts Z. 1 and Z .3;> explanatory of the Neophyt e Ritual of the G.'. D .'., w here the cand idate is taken to va rious stations in the Temple, each station ha ving a symboli c meaning of its own; but in pur e invoc ation a better example is given in Liber 831> . In the construction of a ceremony a n important thing to de cide is whether yo u will or will not make such movements. For every Circle has its natural symbo lism, and e ven if no us e is to be made of these facts, one must be careful not to let anything be inharmonious with the natural attributions.> For the sensit ive aura of the magician might be disturbed, and the value of the ceremony c omp letely de stroyed, by t he embarrassment caused by t he discovery of some such err or, just as if a pre-occupied T-totaller found t hat he had strayed into a Templ e of the Demon R um! It is therefore impossible to ne glect the theory of the Ci rcle. {81} To take a simple example, suppos e that, in an Evocation of Bartzabel, the pl anet Mars, whose sphere is Geburah (Severity) were situated (actually, in the h eavens) oppos ite to the Square of Chesed (Mercy) of the Tau in the Circle, and the triangle placed accordingly. It would be improper for the Magus to stand o n that Square unless using this formula, \"I, from Chesed, rule Geburah through the Path of the Lion\"; while --- taking a n extreme case --- to stand on t he squ are of Hod ( which is naturally dom inated by G eburah) would be a madness which o nly a formula of the very highest Magick could count eract. 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Certain pos itions, how ever, such as Tiphareth>, are so sympathetic to the Ma gus himself that he may us e them without reference to the nature of the spirit, or of the ope ration; unless he requires an exceptionally pr ecise spirit free o f all extraneous elements, or one whose nature is difficulty compatible with Ti phareth. To show how these pos itions may be used in conjunction w ith the spirals, sup pose that you a re invoki ng H athor, Godde ss of Love, to de scend upon t he Altar. Standing on t he square of Netzach you w ill make your invoc ation to Her, and th en da nce an inward spiral deosil ending a t the foot of the altar, where you s in k on your kne es with your arms raised above the altar as if inviting H er embrac e.> To conclude, one may add that natural artistic ability, of you pos sess it, for ms an excellent guide. All Art is Magick. Isadora Duncan ha s this gift of gesture in a very high de gree. Let the read er study he r dancing; if pos sible rather in pr ivate than in publ ic, and learn t he superb \"unconsciousness\" --- which is magical consciousness --- with which s he suits the action to the melody.> There is no m ore potent means than Art of calling f orth true Gods to visible appearance. {82}  I V.

They may be described c ollectively --- the difference between them consists only in this, that the ins trument with which they are made seals them with its own special properties. I t is of no gr eat importance (even so) whether they are made by c lapping the han ds or stamping the feet, by s trokes of one of the weapons , or by t he theoretica lly appropriate instrument, the bell. It may ne vertheless be admitted that the y be come more important in the ceremony i f the Magician considers it worth whil e to take up> an instrument whose single pur pose is to pr oduc e them. Let it first be laid dow n that a knoc k asserts a conne ction be tween the Magici an and the object which he strikes. Thus the use of the bell, or of the hands, means that the Magician wishes to impress the atmosphere of the whole circle w ith what has been or is about to be done . He wishes to formulate his will in s ound, a nd r adiate it in every direction; moreover, to influence that which live s by br eath in the sense of his pur pose, and to summon it to be ar witness to hi s Word. The hands are used as symbols of his executive pow er, the bell to repr esent his consciousness exalted into music. To strike with the wand is to utte r the fiat of creation; the cup vi brates with his delight in receiving s piritua l wine. A blow with the dagger is like the signal for battle. The disk is use d to express the throwing dow n of the price of one 's pur chase. To stamp with t he foot is to de clare one 's mastery of the matter in ha nd. S imilarly, any ot he r form of giving knoc ks has its own virtue. From the above examples the intell igent student will have perceived the method of interpreting e ach individual ca se that may come in que stion. As above said, the object struck is the object impressed. Thus, a blow upon the altar affirms that he has complied with the laws of his ope ration. To str ike the lamp is to summon the Light divine. Thus for the rest. It must also be obs erved that many c ombinations of ideas are made pos sible b y this conve ntion. To strike the wand w ithin the cup is to apply the creative will to its proper complement, and s o {83} pe rform the Great Work by t he formul a of Regeneration. To strike with the hand on t he dagger declares that one dem ands the use of the dagger as a tool to extend one 's executive pow er. The read er will recall how Siegfried smote Nothung, t he sword of Need, upon t he lance o f Wotan. B y the action Wagner, who w as instructed how to apply magical formula e by one of the heads of our Order, intended his hearers to unde rstand that the reign of authority and pa ternal pow er had come to an end; that the new master of the world was intellect. The general object of a knoc k or a kne ll is to mark a stage in the ceremony. Sasaki Shigetz tells us in his essay on S hinto that the Japanese are accustom 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ed to clap their hands four times \"to dr ive away evil spirits\". He explains th at what really ha ppens is that the sudde n and s harp impact of the sound t hrows the mind into an alert activity which enables it to br eak loose from the obs ess ion of its previous mood. I t is aroused to apply itself aggressively to the id eals which ha d oppr essed it. There is therefore a perfectly rational interpret ation of the psychological pow er of the knoc k. In a Magical ceremony t he knoc k is employed for much the same pur pose. The Magician us es it like the chorus in a Greek play. It helps him to make a clean cut, to turn his attention f rom one part of his work to the next. So much for the general character of the knoc k or kne ll. Even this limited point of view offers great oppor tunities to the resourceful Magician. B ut furt her pos sibilities lie to our hand. I t is not usually de sirable to attempt to c onve y anything e xcept emphasis, and pos sibly mood, by va rying the force of the blow. It is obvi ous, moreover, that there is a natural corresponde nce between the hard loud knoc k of imperious command on t he one hand, a nd the soft slurred knoc k of sympathetic comprehension on t he other. It is easy to distingui sh be t ween the bang of the outraged creditor at the front, and the hus hed tap of the lover at the bedroom , door . M agical theory cannot here add instruction to inst inct. But a knoc k ne ed not be single; the pos sible combinations are evidently infi nite. We need onl y discuss the general principles of determining w hat num ber o f strokes will be proper in any c ase, {84} a nd how we may interrupt any s eries so as to express our idea by m eans of structure. The general rule is that a single knoc k ha s no s pecial significance as such, because unity is omniform. It represents Kether, which is the source of all t hings equally without partaking of any qua lity by w hich we discriminate one thi ng f rom another. Continuing on t hese lines, the num ber of knoc ks will refer to the Sephira or other idea Qabalistically cogna te with that num ber. Thus, 7 kn ocks will intimate Venus, 11 the Great Work, 17 t he Trinity of Fathers, and 19 the Feminine Principle in its most general sense. Analyzing the matter a little further, we remark firstly that a battery of t oo m any knoc ks is confusing, a s well as liable to ove rweight the other parts of the ritual. In pr actice, 11 is about the limit. It is usually not difficult to arrange to cover all necessary gr ound w ith that num ber. Secondl y, each is so extensive in scope, and includes aspects so diverse fro m a practical standpoi nt that our danger lies in va gueness. A knoc k shoul d be well defined; its meaning s houl d be precise. The very na ture of knoc ks sugge st s smartness and a ccuracy. We must therefore devise some means of making the se quence significant of the special sense which may be appropriate. Our only res ource is in the use of intervals. It is evidently impossible to attain gr eat variety in the smaller num bers. But this fact illustrates the excellence of our system. There is only one way of striking 2 knoc ks, and this fact agrees with the nature of Chokm ah; there is only one way of creating. We can express only our selves, although w e do s o in dupl ex form. But there are three ways of striking 3 knoc ks, and these 3 w ays correspond t o the threefold manner in which Binah can receive the creative idea . There are three pos sible types of triangle. We may unde rstand a n idea eithe r as an uni ty tripartite, as an uni ty dividing itself into a dua lity, or as a d uality ha rmonized into an uni ty. Any of these methods may be indicated by 3 e q ual knoc ks; 1 followed, after a pause, by 2; and 2 f ollowed, after a pause, by 1. As the nature of the num ber becomes more complex, the pos sible varieties inc rease rapidly. There are num erous ways of striking 6, e ach of which is suited to the nature of the several {85} a spects of Tiphareth. We may leave the deter mination of these points to the ingenuity of the student. The most generally us eful and a daptable battery is composed of 11 strokes. The principal reasons for this are as follows: \"Firstly\", 11 is the num ber of M agick in itself. It is therefore suitable to all types of ope ration. \" Secondl y\", it is the sacred num ber par excellence of the new Aeon. As it is written i n the Book of the Law: \"...11, as all their num bers who a re of us.\" \"Thirdly\", 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" it is the num ber of the letters of the word ABRAHADABRA, which is the word of the Aeon. The structure of this word is such that it expresses the great Work, in every one of its aspects. \"Lastly\", it is pos sible thereby to express all possible spheres of ope ration, w hatever their nature. This is effected by m aki ng a n equation be tween the num ber of the Sephira and the difference between tha t num ber and 1 1. F or example, 2 D egree=9Square is the formula of the grade of initiation c orrespondi ng to Yesod. Yesod r epresents the instability of air, th e sterility of the moon; but these qua lities are balanced in it by t he stabilit y implied in its pos ition a s the Founda tion, a nd by i ts function of generation. This complex is further equilibrated by i dentifying it with the num ber 2 of C hokm ah, w hich pos sesses the airy qua lity, being the Word, and the lunar qua lity , being the reflection of the sun of Kether as Yesod is the sun of Tiphareth. It is the wisdom which is the founda tion by be ing c reation. This entire cycle of ideas is expressed in the doubl e formula 2 D egree = 9Square, 9 D egree = 2Squ are; and a ny of these ideas may be selected and a rticulated by a suitable batte ry. We may conclude with a single illustration of how the above principles may b e put into pr actice. Let us suppos e that the Magician contemplates an ope ratio n for the pur pose of helping hi s mind to resist the tendency to wander. This w ill be a work of Yesod. B ut he must emphasize the stability of that Sephira as against the Airy qua lity which it pos sesses. His first action w ill be to put the 9 unde r the protection of the 2; the battery at this point will be 1-9-1. But this 9 as it stands is sugge stive of the changefulness of the moon. I t may occur to him to divide this into 4 a nd 5, 4 be ing the num ber of fixity, law, a nd a uthoritative pow er; and 5 t hat of courage, energy, and triumph of the spiri t {86} ove r the elements. He will reflect, moreover, that 4 is symbolic of the stability of matter, while 5 expresses the same idea with regard to motion. A t this stage the battery will appear as 1-2-5-2-1. After due consideration he will probably conclude that to split up t he central 5 w ould tend to de stroy the simplicity of his formula, and de cide to us e it as it stands. The pos sible al ternative would be to make a single knoc k the centre of his battery as if he ap pealed to the ultimate immutability of Kether, invoki ng that unity by pl acing a fourfold knoc k on e ither side of it. In this case, his battery would be 1-4-1 -4-1. H e will naturally ha ve been careful to pr eserve the balance of each pa rt of the battery against the correspondi ng pa rt. This would be particularly ne c essary in an ope ration s uch as we have chosen for our example. -----------  {87}  C HAPTER XI O F OUR LADY BABALON AND OF THE BEAST  WHEREON SHE RIDETH.

They are only communicated by t he Master Therion to chosen pupi ls in pr ivate instruction.  I I The essential magical work, apart from any pa rticular ope ration, i s the prop er formation of the Magical Being or Body of Light. This process will be discu ssed at some length in Chapter XVIII. We will here assume that the magician ha s succeeded in de veloping hi s Body o f Light until it is able to go a nyw here and do a nything. There will, how ever, be a certain limitation to his work, be cause he has formed his magical body f ro m the fine matter of his own element. Therefore, although he may be able to pe netrate the utmost recesses of the heavens, or conduc t vigorous combats with th e most unpr onounc eable demons of the pit, it may be impossible for him to do a s much as knoc k a vase from a mantelpiece. His magical body i s composed of matt er too tenuous to affect directly the gross matter of which illusions such as t ables and c hairs are made.> {89} There has been a good de al of discussion in the past within the Colleges of the Holy Ghost, as to whether it would be quite legitimate to seek to transcend this limitation. O ne need not presume to pa ss judgm ent. One can leave the de cision to the will of each magician. The Book of the Dead contains many c hapters intended to enable the magical e ntity of a man who is dead, and s o de prived (according to the theory of death t hen current) of the material vehicle for executing hi s will, to take on t he for m of certain animals, such as a golden ha wk or a crocodile, and in such form to go a bout the earth \"taking hi s pleasure among t he living.\" > As a general rule , material was suppl ied out of which he could construct the party of the second part aforesaid, he reinafter referred to as the hawk. We need not , how ever, consider this que stion of death. I t may of ten be conv enient for the living to go a bout the world in some such incogni to. N ow, then, conceive of this magical body a s creative force, seeking m anifestation; as a G od, s eeking incarnation. There are two ways by w hich this aim may be effected. The first method i s to build up a n appropriate body f rom its elements. This is, generally speaking, a very ha rd thing to do, be cause the phys ical constitution of any m aterial being with much pow er is, or at least shoul d be , the outcome of ages of evolution. However, there is a lawful method of produc ing a n hom unculus which is taught in a certain secret organization, pe rhaps know n to some of those who m ay read thi s, which could ve ry readily be adapted to some such pur pose as we are now discu ssing. The second m ethod s ounds very easy and a musing. You take some organism alre ady e xisting, w hich ha ppens to be suitable to your pur pose. You dr ive out the magical being {89} w hich inhabits it, and take pos session. To do t his by f orce is neither easy nor justifiable, because the magical being of the other was in carnated in accordance with its Will. And \" ... thou ha st no r ight but to do t h y will.\" One shoul d ha rdly strain this sentence to make one 's own will include the will to ups et somebody e lse's will!> Moreover, it is extremely difficult thus to expatriate another magical being; for though, unl ess it is a complete m icrocosm like a hum an be ing, i t cannot be called a star, it is a little bit of a star, and pa rt of the body of Nuit. But there is no c all for all this frightfulness. There is no ne ed to knoc k the girl dow n, unl ess she refuses to do w hat you w ant, and s he will always comp ly if you s ay a few nice things to he r.> You c an always use the body i nhabited by a n elemental, such as an eagle, hare, wolf, or any c onve nient animal, by m a king a very simple compact. You take ove r the respons ibility for the animal, t hus building it up i nto your own magical hierarchy. This represents a tremendo us gain to the animal.> It completely fulfils its ambition by a n alliance of t his extremely intimate sort with a Star. The magician, on t he other hand, i s a ble to transform and r etransform himself in a thous and w ays by a ccepting a reti nue of such adherents. In this way the projection of the \"astral\" or Body of L 53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ight may be made absolutely tangible and pr actical. At the same time, the magi cian must realise that in unde rtaking the Karma of any e lemental, he is assumin g a very serious respons ibility. The bond w hich uni tes him with that elemental is love; and, t hough i t is only a small part of the outfit of a magician, it i s the whole of the outfit of the elemental. He will, therefore, suffer intense ly in case of any e rror or misfortune occurring to his protegee. This feeling is rather peculiar. It is quite instinctive with the best men. They {90} he ar of the destruction of a city of a few thous and inhabitants with entire callous ness, but then they he ar of a dog ha ving hur t its paw, they feel Weltschmertz a cutely. It is not necessary to say much more than this concerning transformations. Those to whom the subject naturally appeals will readily unde rstand the importa nce of what has been said. Those who a re otherwise inclined may reflect that a nod i s as good a s a wink to a blind hor se.  - ------  {91}  C HAPTER XII O F THE BLOODY SACRIFICE: AND MATTERS COGNATE. It is necessary for us to consider carefully the problems conne cted with the bloody s acrifice, for this que stion is indeed traditionally important in M agic k. N igh a ll ancient Magick revolves around t his matter. In pa rticular all the Osirian religions --- the rites of the Dying G od - -- refer to this. The slayi ng of Osiris and Adoni s; the mutilation of Attis; the cults of Mexico and P eru; the story of Hercules or Melcarth; the legends of Dionys us and of Mithra, are all conne cted with this one idea. In the Hebrew religion w e find the same thin g inculcated. The first ethical lesson in the Bible is that the only sacrifice pleasing to the Lord is the sacrifice of blood; Abel, who m ade this, finding f avour with the Lord, w hile Cain, w ho of fered cabbages, was rather naturally con sidered a cheap sport. The idea recurs again and a gain. We have the sacrifice of the Passover, following on t he story of Abraham's being c ommanded to sacrif ice his firstborn son, w ith the idea of the substitution of animal for hum an li fe. The annua l ceremony of the two goa ts carries out this in pe rpetuity. And we see again the dom ination of this idea in the romance of Esther, where Haman and M ordecai are the two goa ts or gods ; and ul timately in the presentation of t he rite of Purim in Palestine, where Jesus and B arabbas happened to be the Goat s in that particular year of which we hear so much, w ithout agreement on t he da te. This subject must be studied in the \"Golden Bough\" , where it is most learnedly set forth by D r. J. G. Frazer. Enough ha s now been said to show that the bloody s acrifice has from time imm emorial been the most considered pa rt of Magick. {92} The ethics of the thing appear to ha ve concerned no one ; nor, to tell the truth, ne ed they do s o. As S t. Paul says, \"Without shedding of blood t here is no r emission\"; and w ho a re we to argue with St. Paul? But, after all that, it is ope n to any one to ha ve an y opi nion that he likes upon t he subject, or any ot her subject, thank G od! At the same time, it is most necessary to study t he bus iness, whatever we may be g oing to do a bout it; for our ethics themselves will naturally de pend upon our t 54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"heory of the universe. If we were quite certain, for example, that everybody w ent to he aven when he died, there could be no s erious objection to murder or su icide, as it is generally conceded --- by t hose who know neither --- that earth is not such a pleasant place as heaven. However, there is a mystery concealed in this theory of the bloody s acrifice which is of great importance to the student, and w e therefore make no f urther apology, We shoul d not have made even this apology f or an apology, had it not been for the solicitude of a pious young f riend of great austerity of character who insisted that the part of this chapter which now follows --- the part whic h was originally written --- might cause us to be misunde rstood. This must not be. The blood i s the life. This simple statement is explained by t he Hindus by saying that the blood i s the principal vehicle of vital Prana.> There is some ground f or the belief that there is a definite substance>, not isolated as yet, whose presence makes all {93} t he difference between live and de ad matter. We pass by w ith de served contempt the pseudo- scientific experiments of American c harlatans who c laim to ha ve established that weight is lost at the moment of de ath, and the uns uppor ted statements of alleged clairvoya nts that they ha ve seen the soul issuing like a vapour from the mouth of persons \"in articulo mortis\"; but his experiences as an explorer have convi nced the Master Therion that meat loses a notable por tion of its nutritive value within a very few minutes after the death of the animal, and that this loss proceeds with ever-diminishing r ap idity as time goe s on. I t is further generally conceded that live food, s uch a s oys ters, is the most rapidly assimilable and m ost concentrated form of energy .> Laboratory experiments in food- values seem to be almost worthless, for reas ons which we cannot here enter into; the general testimony of mankind a ppears a safer guide. It would be unw ise to conde mn as irrational the practice of those savages wh o tear the heart and liver from an adversary, and de vour them while yet warm. In any c ase it was the theory of {94} t he ancient Magicians, that any living be ing is a storehous e of energy va rying in qua ntity according to the size and he a lth of the animal, and in qua lity according to its mental and m oral character. At the death of the animal this energy is liberated sudde nly. The animal shoul d therefore be killed> within the Circle, or the Triangle, a s the case may be , so that its energy c annot escape. An animal shoul d be selec ted whose nature accords with that of the ceremony - -- thus, by s acrificing a f emale lamb one would not obtain any a ppreciate qua ntity of the fierce energy us eful to a Magician who w as invoki ng M ars. In such a case a ram> would be more suitable. And this ram shoul d be virgin --- the whole potential of its origina l total energy s houl d not have been diminished in any w ay.> For the highest sp iritual working one must accordingly choos e that victim which contains the grea test and pur est force. A male child of perfect innoc ence and hi gh intelligence > is the most satisfactory and s uitable victim. {95} For evocations it would be more conve nient to place the blood of the victim in the Triangle --- the idea being that the spirit might obtain from the blood t h is subtle but phys ical substance which was the quintessence of its life in such a manner as to enable it to take on a visible and tangible shape.> Those magicians who a bject to the use of blood ha ve endeavored to replace it with incense. For such a pur pose the incense of Abramelin may be bur nt in lar ge qua ntities. Dittany of Crete is also a valuable medium. Both these incense s are very catholic in their nature, and s uitable for almost any m aterializatio n. But the bloody s acrifice, though m ore dangerous, is more efficacious; and f o r nearly all pur poses hum an sacrifice is the best. The truly gr eat Magician wi ll be able to us e his own blood, or pos sibly that of a disciple, and that witho ut sacrificing the phys ical life irrevocably.> An example of this sacrifice is given in Chapter 44 of Liber 333. This Mass may be recommended ge nerally for daily pr actice. One last word on t his subject. There is a Magical ope ration of maximum impo rtance: the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary to utter a Wor 55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"d, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood. B efore man is ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great War must be fought . This Bloody S acrifice is the cr itical point of the World-{96}C eremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowne d and c onque ring C hild, as Lord of the Aeon.> This whole matter is prophe sied in the Book of the Law itself; let the stude nt take note, and e nter the ranks of the Host of the Sun.  I I There is another sacrifice with regard to which the Adepts have always maint ained the most profound s ecrecy. It is the supreme mystery of practical Magick . Its name is the Formula of the Rosy Cross. In this case the victim is alway s --- in a certain sense --- the Magician himself, and the sacrifice must coinc ide with the utterance of the most sublime and s ecret name of the God w hom he w ishes to invoke . Properly pe rformed, it never fails of its effect. But it is difficult for t he beginner to do i t satisfactorily, because it is a great effort for the mind to remain concentrated upon t he pur pose of the ceremony. The ove rcoming of thi s difficulty lends most pow erful aid to the Magician. It is unw ise for him to attempt it until he has received regular initiation in the true> Order of the Rosy Cross, {97} a nd he must have taken the vow s with the fullest comprehension a nd e xperience of their meaning. I t is also extreme ly de sirable that he shoul d ha ve attained an absolute degree of moral emancipat ion> , and that pur ity of spirit which results from a perfect unde rstanding bot h of the differences and ha rmonies of the planes upon t he Tree of Life. For this reason F RATER PERDURABO has never dared to us e this formula in a fu lly ceremonial manner, save onc e only, on a n oc casion of tremendous import, whe n, indeed, it was not He that made the offering, but ONE in Him. For he percei ved a grave defect in his moral character which he has been able to ove rcome on the intellectual plane, but not hitherto upon hi gher planes. Before the concl usion of writing this book he will have done so.> The practical details of the Bloody S acrifice may be studied in va rious ethn ological manuals, but the general conclusions are summed up i n Frazer's \"Golden Bough\" , which is strongl y recommended to the reader. Actual ceremonial details likewise may be left to experiment. The method of killing is practically uni form. The animal shoul d be stabbed to the heart, or its throat severed, in either case by t he knife. All other methods of killing are less efficacious; even in the case of Crucifixion de ath is given by s tabbi ng.> One may remark that warm-bloode d animals only are used as victims: with two principal exceptions. The first is the serpent, which is only us ed in a very s pecial Ritual;> the second t he magical beetles of Liber Legis. (See Part IV.) {98} One word of warning is perhaps necessary for the beginner. The victim must be in pe rfect health --- or its energy m ay be as it were poisoned. I t must als o not be too large:> the amount of energy di sengaged is almost unimaginably gr e at, and out of all anticipated pr opor tion to the strength of the animal. Conse quently, the Magician may easily be ove rwhelmed and obs essed by t he force which he has let loose; it will then pr obably manifest itself in its lowest and m ost objectionable form. The most intense spirituality of pur pose> is absolutely e ssential to safety. In evocations the danger is not so gr eat, as the Circle forms a protection; but the circle in such a case must be protected, not only by t he names of God a nd the Invoc ations used at the same time, but by a long ha bit of successful def ence.> If you a re easily disturbed or alarmed, or if you ha ve not yet ove rcome the tendency of the mind to wander, it is not advisable for you t o pe rform {99 } the \"Bloody S acrifice\".> Yet it shoul d not be forgotten that this, and that other art at which we have dared da rkly to hint, are the supreme formulae of Pr actical Magick. You a re also likely to ge t into troubl e ove r this chapter unless you t ruly c omprehend its meaning.> 56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"  - -------- {100}  C HAPTER XIII  O F THE BANISHINGS:  AND OF THE PURIFICATIONS. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and ha d be tter come first. Purity means sin gleness. God is one . The wand is not a wand if it has something s ticking to i t which is not an essential part of itself. If you w ish to invoke Venus, you d o not succeed if there are traces of Saturn mixed up w ith it. That is a mere logical commonpl ace: in magick one must go m uch farther than this. One finds one 's analogy i n electricity. If insulation is imperfect, the whole current goe s back to earth. I t is useless to plead that in all those mi les of wire there is only one -hundr edth of an inch unpr otected. I t is no good building a ship if the water can enter, through how ever small a hole. That first task of the Magician in every ceremony i s therefore to render hi s Circle absolutely impregnable.> If one littlest thought intrude upon t he min d of the Mystic, his concentration is absolutely de stroyed; and hi s consciousne ss remains on e xactly the same level as the Stockbroker's. Even the smallest b aby is incompatible with the virginity of its mother. If you l eave even a sing le spirit within the circle, the effect of the conjuration w ill be entirely abs orbed by i t.> {101} The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of pur ificati on, \" firstly\", of himself, \"secondl y\", of his instruments, \"thirdly\", of the pl ace of working. Ancient Magicians recommended a preliminary pur ification of fr om three days to many m onths. During this period of training they took t he utm ost pains with diet. They avoided animal food, l est the elemental spirit of th e animal shoul d ge t into their atmosphere. They pr actised sexual abstinence, l est they shoul d be influenced in any w ay by t he spirit of the wife. Even in re gard to the excrements of the body t hey were equally careful; in trimming the h air and na ils, they ceremonially de stroyed> the severed por tion. They fasted, so that the body i tself might destroy a nything e xtraneous to the bare necessity of its existence. They pur ified the mind by s pecial prayers and c onservations . They avoided the contamination of social intercourse, especially the conjuga l kind; and their servitors were disciples specially chosen and c onsecrated for the work. In modern times our superior unde rstanding of the essentials of this process enables us to dispense to some extent with its external rigour s; but the inter nal pur ification m ust be even more carefully pe rformed. We may eat meat, provi ded that in doi ng s o we affirm that we eat it in or der to strengthen us for the special pur pose of our propos ed invoc ation.> {102} By thus avoiding those actions which might excite the comment of our neighbo urs we avoid the graver dangers of falling into spiritual pride. We have unde rstood t he saying: \"To the pur e all things are pur e\", and w e hav e learnt how to act up t o it. We can analyse the mind f ar more acutely than co uld the ancients, and w e can therefore distingui sh the real and r ight feeling f 57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"rom its imitations. A man may eat meat from self-indul gence, or in or der to av oid the dangers of asceticism. We must constantly examine our selves, and a ssur e our selves that every action is really subservient to the One Purpose. It is ceremonially de sirable to seal and a ffirm this mental pur ity by R itual , and a ccordingly the first ope ration in any a ctual ceremony i s bathing a nd r ob ing, w ith appropriate words. The bath signifies the removal of all things extr aneous to antagoni stic to the one thought . The putting on of the robe is the p ositive side of the same ope ration. I t is the assumption of the fame of mind s uitable to that one thought . A similar ope ration takes place in the preparation of every instrument, as h as been seen in the Chapter devoted to that subject. In the preparation of the place of working, t he same considerations apply. We first remove from that pl ace all objects; and w e then put into it those objects, and onl y those {103} ob jects, which are necessary. During m any da ys we occupy our selves in this proce ss of cleansing a nd c onsecration; and this again is confirmed in the actual cer emony. The cleansed and c onsecrated M agician takes his cleansed and c onsecrated ins truments into that cleansed and c onsecrated place, and there proceeds to repeat that doubl e ceremony i n the ceremony i tself, which ha s these same two main pa r ts. The first part of every ceremony i s the banishing; the second, t he invoki n g. The same formula is repeated even in the ceremony of banishing itself, for in the banishing r itual of the pentagram we not only command the demons to de pa rt, but invoke the Archangels and their hos ts to act as gua rdians of the Circle dur ing our pre-occupation w ith the ceremony pr oper. In more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to ba nish everything by na me. Each element, each planet, and e ach sign, pe rhaps even the Sephiroth themselves; al l are removed, including the very one which we wished to invoke , for that force s as existing in Nature is always impure. But this process, being long a nd w ea risome, is not altogether advisable in actual working. I t is usually sufficien t to pe rform a general banishing, a nd to rely upon t he aid of the gua rdians inv oked. L et the banishing therefore be short, but in no w ise slurred --- for it is useful as it tends to pr oduc e the proper attitude of mind f or the invoc ation s. \"The Banishing R itual of the Pentagram\" (as now rewritten, L iber 333, C ap. XXV) is the best to us e.> Only the four elements are specifically mentioned, b ut these four elements contain the planets and the signs> --- the four elements are Tetragrammaton; and Tetragrammaton is the Universe. This special precauti on is, how ever, necessary: make exceedingly sure that the ceremony of banishing is effective! {104} B e alert and on your gua rd! Watch be fore you pr ay! The feeling of success in ba nishing, onc e acquired, is unm istakable. At the conclusion, i t is usually well to pa use for a few moments, and to mak e sure onc e more that every thing ne cessary to the ceremony i s in its right pla ce. The Magician may then pr oceed to the final consecration of the furniture o f the Temple.>  - --------  {105} #Magick in Theory and P ractice by Aleister Crowley 1988 e .v. key entry and pr oof reading w ith re-format and c onve rsion f rom XYWrit e to 7- bit ASCII on 10/ 14/90 e .v. done by B ill Heidrick, T.G. of O.T.O.

I Consecration is the active dedication of a thing to a single pur pose. Banis hing pr events its use for any ot her pur pose, but it remains inert until consecr ated. P urification is performed by w ater, and ba nishing by a ir, whose weapon i s the sword. C onsecration is performed by f ire, usually symbolised by t he holy lamp.> In most extant magical rituals the two ope rations are performed at onc e; or (at least) the banishing ha s the more important place, and gr eater pains seem t o be taken with it; but as the student advances to Adeptship the banishing w ill diminish in importance, for it will no l onge r be so ne cessary. The Circle of the Magician will have been pe rfected by hi s habit of Magical work. I n the tru est sense of that word, he will never step out side the Circle dur ing hi s whole life. But the consecration, be ing the application of a pos itive force, can alw ays be raised to a closer approximation to pe rfection. C omplete success in ba n 59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ishing is soon a ttained; but there can be no c ompleteness in the advance to hol iness. {106} The method of consecration is very simple. Take the wand, or the holy oil, and dr aw upon t he object to be consecrated the supreme symbol of the force to w hich you de dicate it. Confirm this dedication in words, invoki ng the appropria te God to indw ell that pur e temple which you ha ve prepared for Him. Do this wi th fervour and love, as if to ba lance the icy de tachment which is the proper me ntal attitude for banishing.> The words of pur ification a re: Asperges me, Therion, hys sopo, e t munda bor; lav abis me, et super nivem dealbabor. Those of consecration a re: Accendat in nobi s Therion ignem sui amoris et fla mmam aeternae caritatis.> These, as initiates of the VII Degree of O.T.O. are aware, mean more than ap pears.  I I It is a strange circumstance that no M agical writer has hitherto treated the immensely important subject of the Magical Link. I t might almost be called th e Missing L ink. I t has apparently always been taken for granted, onl y lay writ ers on M agick like Dr. J. G. Frazer have accorded the subject its full importan ce. Let us try to make considerations of the nature of Magick in a strictly scie ntific spirit, as well as, deprived of the guidance of antiquity, we may. What is a Magical Operation? It may be defined as any e vent in na ture which is brought to pa ss by Will. We must not exclude potato-growing or banking f ro m our definition. {107} Let us take a very simple example of a Magical Act: that of a man blowing hi s nos e. What are the condi tions of the success of the Operation? Firstly, that the man's Will shoul d be to blow his nos e; secondl y, that he shoul d ha ve a nos e capable of being bl own; thirdly, that he shoul d ha ve at command a n apparatus capable of expressing hi s spiritual Will in terms of material force, and a pplyi ng that force to the object which he desires to affect. His Will may be as str ong a nd c oncentrated as that of Jupiter, and hi s nos e may be totally incapable of resistance; but unless the link is made by t he use of his nerves and m uscles in accordance with ps ychological, phys iological, and phys ical law, the nos e wi ll remain unbl own through a ll eternity. Writers of Magick ha ve been uns paring in their efforts to instruct us in the preparation of the Will, but they seem to ha ve imagined that no f urther precau tion w as necessary. There is a striking c ase of an epidemic of this error whos e history is familiar to everybody . I refer to Christian Science, and the cogn ate doc trines of \"mental healing\" and the like. The theory of such pe ople, str ipped of dogm atic furbelows, is perfectly good M agic of its kind, i ts negroid k ind. The idea is correct enough: matter is an illusion c reated by Will through mind, a nd c onsequently susceptible of alteration a t the behest of its creator. But the practice has been lacking. They ha ve not developed a scientific tech nique for applying the Will. It is as if they expected the steam of Watts' ket tle to conve y pe ople from place to place without the troubl e of inventing a nd u sing locomotives. Let us apply these considerations to M agick in its restricted sense, the sen se in which it was always unde rstood unt il the Master Therion e xtended it to co ver the entire ope rations of Nature. What is the theory implied in such rituals as those of the Goetia? What doe s the Magician do? He applies himself to invoke a God, a nd this God c ompels th e appearance of a spirit whose function is to pe rform the Will of the magician at the moment. There is no t race of what may be called machinery in the method . The exorcist hardly takes the pains of preparing a material basis for the sp irit to incarnate except the bare conne ction {108} of himself with his sigil. It is apparently assumed that the spirit already pos sesses the means of working on m atter. The conception s eems to be that of a school boy w ho a sks his father to tell the butler to do s omething f or him. In other words, the theory is gro 60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ssly animistic. The savage tribes described by F razer had a far more scientifi c theory. The same may be said of witches, who a ppear to ha ve been wiser than the thaumaturgists who de spised them. They at least made waxen images --- iden tified by ba ptism --- of the people they wished to control. They at least used appropriate bases for Magical manifestations, such as blood a nd ot her vehicles of animal force, with those of vegetable virtue such as herbs. They were also careful to put their bewitched pr oduc ts into actual contact --- material or as tral --- with their victims. The classical exorcists, on t he contrary, for all their learning, w ere careless about this essential condi tion. They acted as s tupidly as people who s houl d write bus iness letters and om it to pos t them. It is not too m uch to say that this failure to unde rstand the condi tions of success account s for the discredit into which M agick fell until Eliphas Levi un dertook t he task of re-habilitating it two ge nerations ago. B ut even he (profo undl y as he studied, and luminous ly as he expounde d, the nature of Magick consi dered as a universal formula) paid no a ttention w hatever to that que stion of th e Magical Link, t hough he everywhere implies that it is essential to the Work. He evaded the que stion by m aking the \"petitio pr incipii\" of assigning to the A stral Light the pow er of transmitting vi brations of all kinds. He now here ente rs into de tail as to how its effects are produc ed. H e doe s not inform us as to the qua litative or qua ntitative laws of this light. (The scientifically train ed student will obs erve the analogy be tween Levi's pos tulate and that of ordina ry science \"in re\" the luminiferous ether.) It is deplorable that nobody s houl d ha ve recorded in a systematic form the r esults of our investigations of the Astral Light. We have no a ccount of its pr operties or of the laws which obt ain in its sphere. Yet these are sufficiently remarkable. We may br iefly not ice that, in the Astral Light, two or more obje cts can {109} oc cupy t he same space at the same time without interfering w ith e ach other or losing their outlines. In that Light, obj ects can change their appearance completely without suffer ing c hange of Nature. The same thing c an reveal itself in an infinite num ber o f different aspects; in fact, it identifies itself by s o doi ng, m uch as a write r or a painter reveals himself in a succession of nove ls or pictures, each of w hich is wholly himself and not hing e lse, but himself unde r varied condi tions, t hough e ach appears utterly different from its fellows. In that Light one is \"s wift without feet and f lying w ithout wings\"; one can travel without moving, a nd communicate without conve ntional means of expression. O ne is insensible to he at, cold, pa in, and ot her forms of apprehension, a t least in the shapes which a re familiar to us in our bodi ly ve hicles. They exist, but they are appreciated by us , and they affect us, in a different manner. In the Astral Light we are bound by w hat is, superficially, an entirely different series of laws. We meet with obs tacles of a strange and s ubtle character; and w e ove rcome them by a n e nergy a nd c unni ng of an or der entirely alien to that which serves us in earthly life. In that Light, symbols are not conve ntions but realities, yet (on the c ontrary) the beings whom we encount er are only symbols of the realities of our own na ture. Our ope rations in that Light are really the adventures of our own personified thought s. The universe is a projection of our selves; an image as u nreal as that of our faces in a mirror, yet, like that face, the necessary form of expression thereof, not to be altered save as we alter our selves.> The mir ror may {1 10} be distorted, dul l, cloude d, or cracked; and to this extent, the reflection of our selves may be false even in respect of its symbolic presentati on. I n that Light, therefore, all that we do i s to discover our selves by m eans of a sequence of hieroglyphi cs, and the changes which we apparently ope rate ar e in an obj ective sense illusions. But the Light servers us in this way. It enables us to see our selves, and t herefore to aid us to initiate our selves by s how ing us what we are doing. I n t he same way a watchmaker uses a lens, though i t exaggerates and thus falsifies the image of the system of wheels which he is trying to adjust. In the same wa y, a writer employs arbitrary characters according to a meaningless conve ntion in or der to enable his reader by r etranslating them to obt ain an approximation to his idea. 61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":" Such are a few of the principal characteristics Astral Light. Its qua ntitat ive laws are much less dissimilar from those of material phys ics. M agicians ha ve too of ten be en foolish enough t o suppos e that all classes of Magical Operati ons were equally easy. They seem to ha ve assumed that the \"almighty pow er of G od\" was an infinite qua ntity in pr esence of which all finites were equally insi gnificant. \"One day is with the Lord as a thous and ye ars\" is their first law o f Motion. \" Faith can move mount ains\" they say, and di sdain to measure either t he faith or the mount ains. If you c an kill a chicken by M agick, w hy not destro y an army with equal exertion? \"With God a ll things are pos sible.\" This absurdity is an error of the same class as that mentioned above . The f acts are wholly oppos ed. Two and two make four in the Astral as rigorously as anyw here else. The distance of one 's Magical target and the accuracy of one 's Magical rifle are factors in the success of one 's Magical shoot ing in just the same way as at Bisley. The law of Magical gravitation is as rigid as that of N ewton. The law of Inverse Squares may not apply; but some {111} s uch law doe s apply. So it is for everything. You c annot produc e a thunde rstorm unless the materials exist in the air at the time, and a Magician who c ould make rain in C umberland m ight fail lamentably in the Sahara. One might make a talisman to wi n the love of a shop- girl and f ind it work, ye t be baffled in the case of a cou ntess; or vice versa. One might impose one 's Will on a farm, and be crushed by that of a city; or vice versa. The MASTER THERION himself, with all his succe sses in every kind of Magick, sometimes appears utterly impotent to pe rform fea ts which almost any a mateur might do, be cause He has matched his Will against t hat of the world, ha ving unde rtaken the Work of a Magus to establish the word o f His Law on t he whole of mankind. H e will succeed, w ithout doubt , but He hard ly expects to see more than a sample of His produc t dur ing H is present incarnat ion. B ut He refuses to waste the least fraction of His force on w orks foreign to His WORK, how ever obvi ous it may seem to the onlooke r that His advantage lie s in commanding s tones to be come bread, or otherwise making things easy for Him self. These considerations being thoroughl y unde rstood w e may return to the que sti on of making the Magical Link. I n the case above cited FRATER PERDURABO compos ed His talisman by i nvoki ng H is Holy Guardian Angel according to the Sacred M ag ick of Abramelin the Mage. That Angel wrote on t he lamen the Word of the Aeon. The Book of the Law is this writing. To this lamen the Master Therion ga ve l ife by de voting H is own life thereto. We may then regard this talisman, the La w, as the most pow erful that has been made in the world's history, for previous talismans of the same type have been limited in their scope by c ondi tions of r ace and c ount ry. M ohammed's talisman, Allah, w as good onl y from Persia to the Pillars of Hercules. The Buddha 's, Anatta, ope rated onl y in the South and E ast of Asia. The new talisman, Thelema, is master of the planet. But now obs erve how the que stion of the Magical Link a rises! No matter how mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless it is applied to any by m ankind. As long a s the Book of the Law was in M anuscript, it could onl y affect the small group a mongs t whom it was circulated. I t had to be put into action by {1 12} t he Magical Operation of publ ishing it. When this was done , it was do ne without proper perfection. I ts commands as to how the work ought to be done were not wholly obe yed. There were doubt and r epugna nce in FRATER PERDURABO's mind, a nd they ha mpered His work. H e was half-hearted. Yet, even so then int rinsic pow er of the truth of the Law and the impact of the publ ication w ere suf ficient to shake the world so that a critical war broke out, and the minds of m en were moved in a mysterious manner. The second bl ow was struck by t he re-pub lication of the Book i n September 1913, a nd this time the might of this Magick burst out and c aused a catastrophe to civilization. At this hour , the MASTER T HERION is concealed, collecting hi s forces for a final blow. When The Book of the Law and its Comment is publ ished, w ith the forces of His whole Will in pe rf ect obe dience to the instructions which ha ve up t o now been misunde rstood or ne glected, the result will be incalculably effective. The event will establish t he kingdom of the Crowned and C onque ring C hild ove r the whole earth, and a ll me n shall bow to the Law, which is \"love unde r will\". 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":" This is an extreme case; but there is one law only to gove rn the small as th e great. The same laws describe and m easure the motions of the ant and the sta rs. Their light is no s wifter than that of a spark. I n every ope ration of Mag ick the link m ust be properly made. The first requisite is the acquisition of adequate force of the kind r equired for the pur pose. We must have electricity of a certain pot ential in sufficient amount if we wish to he at food i n a furnac e. We shall need a more intense current and a greater suppl y to light a city t han to charge a telephone wire. No other kind of force will do. We cannot use the force of steam directly to impel an aeroplane, or to ge t drunk. We must a pply it in adequate strength in an appropriate manner. It is therefore absurd to invoke the spirit of Venus to pr ocure us the love of an Empress, unl ess we take measures to transmit the influence of our work to the lady. We may for example consecrate a letter expressing our Will; or, if we know how , we may us e some object conne cted with the person w hose acts we are attempting to control, such as a lock of hair or a handke rchief {113} onc e bel ongi ng to he r, and s o in subtile conne ction w ith he r aura. But for material en ds it is better to ha ve material means. We must not rely on f ine gut in trolli ng f or salmon. O ur will to kill a tiger is poor ly conve yed by a charge of smal l shot fired at a range of one hundr ed ya rds. Our talisman must, therefore, be an obj ect suitable to the nature of our Operation, a nd w e must have some such means of applying its force to such a way as will naturally compel the obe dienc e of the por tion of Nature which we are trying to change. If one will the deat h of a sinner, it is not sufficient to ha te him, even if we grant that the vibr ations of thought , when sufficiently pow erful and pur e, may modify the Astral l ight sufficiently to impress its intention to a certain extent on s uch pe ople a s happen to be sensitive. It is much surer to us e one 's mind a nd m uscle in ser vice of that hate by de vising a nd m aking a dagger, and then applying the dagger to the heart of one 's enemy. One must give one 's hate a bodi ly form of the sa me order as that which one 's enemy ha s taken for his manifestation. Your spiri t can onl y come into contact with his by m eans of this magical manufacture of p hantoms; in the same way, one can onl y measure one 's mind ( a certain pa rt of it ) against another man's by e xpressing them in some such form as the game of che ss. One cannot use chessmen against another man unl ess he agree to us e them in the same sense as you do. The boa rd and m en form the Magical Link by w hich yo u can pr ove your pow er to constrain him to yield. The game is a device by w hic h you f orce him to turn dow n his king in surrender, a muscular act made in obe d ience to your will, thought he may be twice your weight and s trength. These general principles shoul d enable the student to unde rstand the nature of the work of making the Magical Link. I t is impossible to give detailed inst ructions, because every case demands separate consideration. I t is sometimes e xceedingly difficult to de vise proper measures. Remember that Magick includes all acts soever. Anything m ay serve as a Magi cal weapon. To impose one 's Will on a nation, f or instance, one 's talisman may be a newspaper, one 's triangle a church, or one 's circle a Club. To win a wom an, one 's {114} pa ntacle may be a necklace; to discover a treasure, one 's wand may be a dramatist's pen, or one 's incantation a popul ar song. M any e nds, many m eans: it is only important to remember the essence of the o peration, w hich is to will its success with sufficiently pur e intensity, and to incarnate that will in a body s uitable to express it, a body s uch that its imp act on t he bodi ly expression of the idea one wills to change is to cause it to do s o. F or instance, is it my will to be come a famous phys ician? I banish all \"hostile spirits\" such as laziness, alien interests, and c onfliction pl easures , from my \"circle\" the hos pital; I consecrate my \"weapons \" (my va rious abilitie s) to the study of medicine; I invoke the \"Gods\" (medical authorities) by s tudy ing a nd obe ying their laws in their books . I embody t he \"Formulae\" (the ways i n which causes and e ffects influence disease) in a \"Ritual\" (my pe rsonal style of constraining s ickness to conform with my will). I persist in these conjurat ions year after year, making the Magical gestures of healing the sick, unt il I compel the visible appearance of the Spirit of Time, and m ake him acknow ledge m e his master. I have used the appropriate kind of means, in adequate measure, 63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"and a pplied them in ways pertinent to my pur pose by pr ojecting m y incorporeal i dea of ambition in a course of action s uch as to induc e in others the incorpore al idea of satisfying m ine.

I did not \"sit for\" a medical baronetcy by w ishing I had it, or by a n \"act o f faith\", or by pr aying to God \" to move Pharaoh's heart\", as our modern mental, or our mediaeval, mystic, miracle-monge rs were and a re muddl ers and m audlin en ough t o advise us to do. A few general obs ervations on t he Magical Link m ay not be amiss, in de fault of details; one cannot make a Manual of How to Go Courting, w ith an Open-Sesame to each pa rticular Brigand's Cavern, any m ore than one can furnish a buddi ng b urglar with a directory containing the combination of every existing s afe. But one can poi nt out the broad distinctions between women who yi eld, some to flat tery, some to eloque nce, some to appearance, some to rank, s ome to wealth, some to ardour , and s ome to authority. We {115} c annot exhaust the combinations of Lover's Chess, but we may enum erate the principal gambits: the Bouque t, the Ch ocolates, the Little Dinner, the Cheque-Book, t he Poem, the Motor by M oonl ight, the Marriage Certificate, the Whip, and the Feigned Flight. The Magical Link m ay be classified unde r three main he ads; as it invol ves (1 ) one plane and one person, ( 2) one plane and two or more persons, (3) two plan es. In class (1) the machinery of Magick --- the instrument --- already e xists. Thus, I may wish to he al my ow n body , increase my ow n energy; develop m y ow n m ental pow ers, or inspire my ow n imagination. H ere the Exorcist and the Demon a re already c onne cted, consciously or subconsciously, by a n excellent system of symbols. The Will is furnished by N ature with an apparatus adequately equipped to conve y and e xecute its orders. It is only ne cessary to inflame the Will to the proper pitch and to issue it s commands; they are instantly obe yed, unl ess --- as in the case of organic dis ease --- the apparatus is damaged be yond t he art of Nature to repair. It may b e necessary in such a case to assist the internal \"spirits\" by t he \"purificatio n\" of medicines, the \"banishing\" of diet, or some other extraneous means. But at least there is no ne ed of any s pecial device \"ad hoc \" to effect conta ct between the Circle and the Triangle. Operations of this class are therefore often successful, even when the Magician ha s little or no t echnical know ledge of Magick. Almost any duf fer can \"pull himself together\", devote himself to st udy, break of f a bad ha bit, or conque r a cowardice. This class of work, althou gh the easiest, is yet the most important; for it includes initiation itself in its highest sense. It extends to the Absolute in every dimension; it invol ves the most intimate analysis, and the most comprehensive synthesis. In a sense, it is the sole type of Magick either necessary or proper to the Adept; for it includes both the attainment of the Know ledge and C onve rsation of the Holy Guar dian Angel, and the Adventure of the Abyss. The second c lass includes all ope rations by w hich the Magician strives to im pose his Will upon obj ects outside his own control, but within that of such oth er wills as are symbolised by m eans of {116} a system similar to his own. That is, they can be compelled na turally by c ogna te consciousness. For instance, one may wish to obt ain the know ledge put forth in this book. Not know ing that such a book e xists, one might yet induc e some one who know s of it to of fer a copy. Thus one 's ope ration w ould consist in inflaming one 's Wil l to pos sess the know ledge to the point of devoting one 's life to it, in expres sing that will by s eeking out people who s eem likely to know what is needed, an d in imposing it on t hem by e xhibiting s uch enthusiastic earnestness that they will tell the enqui rer that this book w ill meet his needs. Does this sound t oo s imple? Can this obvi ous common-sense course be really that marvellous Magick that frightens folk so? Yes, even this triviality is on e instance of how Magick works. But the above practical programme may be a fiasco. O ne might then resort to Magick in the conve ntional sense of the word, by c onstructing a nd c harging a P antacle appropriate to the object; this Pantacle shoul d then cause a strain in 64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the Astral Light such that the vibrations would compel some alien consciousness to restore equilibrium by br inging the book.

Bu t my Will is in touch with the woman's by m eans of our minds; I have only to ma ke my mind the master of hers by t he existing m eans of communication; her mind will then pr esent its recantation to he r Will, her Will repeal its decision, a n d he r body s ubm it to mine as the seal of her surrender.

I also attempt to us e the oppos ite formula; to reach it by s ending m y \"famili ar spirits\", the police, to hunt it, and c ompel its obe dience by t hreats.> Again, a sorcerer might happen to pos sess an obj ect belongi ng m agically to a rich man, such as a compromising letter, which is really as much pa rt of him a s his liver; he may then master the will of that man by i ntimidating hi s mind. His pow er to publ ish the letter is as effective as if he could injure the man' s body di rectly. These \"natural\" cases may be transposed into subtler terms; for instance, on e might master another man, even a stranger, by s heer concentration of will, ce remonially or otherwise wrought up t o the requisite potential. But in one way or another that will must be {118} m ade to impinge on t he man; by t he nor mal me ans of contact if pos sible, if not, by a ttacking s ome sensitive spot in his sub conscious sensorium. But the heaviest rod w ill not land the smallest fish unl e ss there be a line of some sort fixed firmly to bot h. The Third Class is characterized by t he absence of any e xisting link be tween the Will of the Magician and that controlling the object to be affected.

This class of ope rations demands not only immense know ledge of the technique of Magick combined with tremendous vigour and s kill, but a degree of Mystical attainment which is exceedingly rare, and w hen found i s usually marked by a n ab solute apathy on t he subject of any a ttempt to achieve any M agick at all. Supp ose that I wish to pr oduc e a thunde rstorm. This event is beyond m y control or that of any ot her man; it is as useless to work on t heir minds as my ow n. N atu re is independent of, and indifferent to, m an's affairs. A storm is caused by atmospheric condi tions on a scale so enormous that the united efforts of all us Earth-vermin could scarcely disperse one cloud, e ven if we could ge t at it. H ow then can any M agician, he who is above all things a know er of Nature, be so absurd as to attempt to throw the Hammer of Thor? Unless he be simply insane, 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"he must be initiated in a Truth which transcends the apparent facts. He must b e aware that all nature is a continuum , so that his mind a nd body a re consubsta ntial with the storm, are equally expressions of One Existence, all alike of th e self-same order of artifices whereby the Absolute appreciates itself. He mus t also ha ve assimilated the fact that the Quantity is just as much a form as Qu ality; that as all things are modes of One Substance, so their measures are mod es of their relation. N ot only are gold and lead mere letters, meaningless in themselves yet appoi nted to spell the One Name; but the difference between the bulk of a mount ain and that of a mouse is no m ore than one method of differenti ating them, just as the letter \"m\" is not bigger than the letter \"i: in any r ea l sense of the word.> {119} Our Magician, w ith this in his mind, w ill most probably leave thunde rstorms to stew in their own juice; but, shoul d he decide (after all) to enliven the af ternoon, he will work in the manner following. First, what are the elements necessary for his storms? He must have certain stores of electrical force, and the right kind of clouds to contain it. He must see that the force doe s not leak away to earth qui etly and s lyly. He must arrange a stress so severe as to be come at last so intolerable that it will disrupt explosively. Now he, as a man, cannot pray to God to cause them, for the Gods are but nam es for the forces of Nature themselves. But, \"as a Mystic\", he know s that all things are pha ntoms of One Thing, a nd th at they may be withdrawn therein to reissue in other attire. He know s that all things are in himself, and that he is All-One with the All. There is therefor e no t heoretical difficulty about conve rting the illusion of a clear sky into t hat of a tempest. On the other hand, he is aware, \"as a Magician\", that illusi ons are gove rned by t he laws of their nature. He know s that twice two is four, although bot h \"two\" and \" four\" are merely pr operties pertaining to One. He ca n onl y us e the Mystical identity of all things in a strictly scientific sense. It is true that his experience of clear skies and s torms proves that his natur e contains elements cogna te with bot h; for it not, they could not affect him. He is the Microcosm of his own M acrocosm, whether or no e ither one or the other extend be yond hi s know ledge of them. He must therefore arouse in himself thos e ideas which are clansmen of the Thunde rstorm, collect all available objects o f the same nature for talismans, and pr oceed to excite all these to the utmost by a Magical ceremony; that is, by i nsisting on t heir godhe ad, so that they fla me within and w ithout him, his ideas vitalising the talismans. There is thus a vivid vibration of high pot ential in a certain gr oup {121} of sympathetic subs tances and f orces; and this spreads as do t he waves from a stone thrown into a lake, widening a nd w eakening; till the disturbance is compensated. J ust as a h andful of fanatics, insane with one ove r-emphasised truth, m ay infect a whole c ount ry for a time by i nflaming that thought in their neighbour s, so the Magicia n creates a commotion by di sturbing the balance of pow er. He transmits his par ticular vibration a s a radio ope rator doe s with his ray; rate-relation de termin es exclusive selection. In pr actice, the Magician must \"evoke the spirits of the storm\" by i dentifyi ng hi mself with the ideas of which atmospheric phe nom ena are the expressions as his hum anity is of him; thus achieved, he must impose his Will upon t hem by vi rtue of the superiority of his intelligence and the integration of his pur pose to their undi rected impulses and unc omprehending interplay. All such M agick de mands the utmost precision in pr actice. It is true that t he best rituals give us instructions in selecting our vehicles of force. In 77 7 we find \" corresponde nces\" of many c lasses of being w ith the various types of operation, s o that we know what weapons , jewels, figures, drugs, perfumes, name s, etc. to employ in any pa rticular work. B ut it has always been assumed that the invoke d force is intelligent and c ompetent, that it will direct itself as d esired without further ado, by t his method of sympathetic vibrations. The necessity of timing the force has been ignor ed; and s o most ope rations, even when well performed as far as invoc ation goe s, are as harmless as igniting loose gunpow der. 66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" But, even allowing that Will is sufficient to de termine the direction, a nd p revent the dispersion of the force, we can ha rdly be sure that it will act on i ts object, unl ess that object be properly pr epared to receive it. The Link m us t be perfectly made. The object must pos sess in itself a sufficiency of stuff sympathetic to our work. We cannot make love to a brick, or set an oa k to run errands. We see, then, that we can ne ver affect anything out side our selves save only as it is also within us . Whatever I do t o another, I do a lso to myself. If I kill a man, I destroy m y ow n life at the same time. That is the magical meanin g of the so-called {121} \" Golden Rule\", which shoul d not be in the imperative b ut in the indicative mood. E very vibration a wakens all others of its particula r pitch. There is thus some justification f or the assumption of previous writers on M agick that the Link is implicit, and ne eds no s pecial attention. Yet, in pr act ice, there is nothing m ore certain than that one ought to confirm one 's will by all pos sible acts on a ll pos sible planes. The ceremony m ust not be confined t o the formally magical rites. We must neglect no m eans to our end, ne ither des pising our common s ense, nor doubt ing our secret wisdom . When Frater I. A. was in da nger of death in 1899 e .v. Frater V.

He is alive to da y>; who c ares wheth er spirits or shekels wrought that which these Magicians willed? Let the Magical Link be made strong! It is \"love unde r will\"; it affirms the identity of the Equation of the work; it makes success Necessity.  - ------ {122}  C HAPTER XVI  \" (Part I)\"  O F THE OATH The third ope ration in any m agical ceremony i s the oath or proclamation. Th e Magician, armed and r eady, stands in the centre of the Circle, and s trikes on ce upon t he bell as if to call the attention of the Universe. He then de clares \"who he is\", reciting hi s magical history by t he proclamation of the grades wh ich he has attained, gi ving the signs and w ords of those grades.> He then states the pur pose of the ceremony, and pr oves that it is necessary to pe rform it and to succeed in its performance. He then takes an oa th be fore the Lord of the Universe (not before the particular Lord whom he is invoki ng) a s if to call Him to witness to the act. He swears solemnly that he will perfor m it --- that nothing s hall prevent him from performing it --- that he will not leave the ope ration unt il it is successfully pe rformed --- and onc e again he s trikes upon t he bell. Yet, having de monstrated himself in that pos ition a t onc e infinitely lofty a nd infinitely uni mportant, the instrument of destiny, he balances this by t he \" Confession\", in which there is again an infinite exaltation ha rmonised with an infinite hum ility. He admits himself to be a weak hum an be ing hum bly aspiring to something hi gher; a creature of circumstance utterly de pendent --- even for 67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"the breath of life --- upon a series of fortunate accidents. {123} H e makes th is confession pr ostrate> before the altar in agony a nd bl oody s weat. He trembl es at the thought of the ope ration w hich he has dared to unde rtake, saying, \" Fa ther, if it be Thy Will, let this cup pa ss from me! Nevertheless not my will b ut Thine be done !\"> The dread answer comes that It Must Be, and this answer so fortifies him wit h hol y zeal that it will seem to him as if he were raised by di vine hands from that prostrate pos ition; with a thrill of holy exaltation he renews joyfully th e Oath, feeling hi mself onc e again no l onge r the man but the Magician, ye t not merely the Magician, but the chosen and a ppoi nted pe rson to accomplish a task w hich, how ever apparently uni mportant, is yet an integral part of universal dest iny, so that if it were not accomplished the Kingdom of Heaven would be bur st i n pieces. He is now ready to commence the invoc ations. He consequently pa uses to cast a last glance around t he Temple to assure himself of the perfect readiness of all things necessary, and to light the incense.  - -------- The Oath is the founda tion of all Work in M agick, as it is an affirmation of the Will. An Oath binds the Magician for ever. In Part II of Book 4 s omethin g ha s already be en said on t his subject; but its importance deserves some furth er elaboration. Thus, shoul d one , loving a woman, m ake a spell to compel her e mbraces, and tiring of her a little later, evoke Zazel to kill her; he will fin d that the implications of his former Oath conflict with those proper to invoke the Unity of the Godhe ad of Saturn. Z azel will refuse to obe y him in the case of the woman whom he has sworn that he loves. To this some may obj ect that, s ince all acts are magical, every man who loves a woman implicitly takes an {124 } Oath of love, and therefore would ne ver be able to murder her later, as we fi nd to be the not unc ommon c ase. The explanation is as follows. It is perfectl y true that when Bill Sykes desires to pos sess Nancy, he doe s in fact evoke a s pirit of the nature of Venus, constraining hi m by hi s Oath of Love (and by hi s magical pow er as a man) to br ing hi m the girl. So also, w hen he wants to kill her, he evoke s a Martial or Saturnian spirit, with an Oath of hate. But these are not pur e planetary spirits, moving in well-defined spheres by r igidly right eous laws. They are gross concretions of confused impulses, \"incapable of unde rstanding the nature of an oa th\". They are also such that the idea of murder i s now ise offensive to the Spirit of Love. It is indeed the criterion of spiritual \"caste\" that conflicting e lements sh ould not coexist in the same consciousness. The psalm-singing P uritan who pe rs ecutes publ icans, and s ecretly soaks himself in fire-water; the bewhiskered phi lanthropist in br oadcloth who s windles his customers and s weats his employees: these men must not be regarded as single-minded scoundr els, whose use of religi on a nd r espectability to cloke their villainies is a deliberate disguise dictat ed by t heir criminal cunni ng. F ar from it, they are only too s incere in their \"virtues\"; their terror of death and of supernatural vengeance is genuine; it p roceeds from a section of themselves which is in irreconcilable conflict with t heir rascality. Neither side can conciliate, suppr ess, or ignor e the other; ye t each is so craven as to endur e its enemy's presence. Such men are therefore without pur e principles; they excuse themselves for every dirty trick that turn s to their apparent advantage. The first step of the Aspirant toward the Gate of Initiation tells him that purity --- unity of pur pose --- is essential above all else. \"Do what thou Wil t\" strikes on hi m, a ray of fierce white flame consuming a ll that is not utterl y God. Very soon he is aware that he cannot consciously contradict himself. H e develops a subtle sense which warns him that two trains of thought which he h ad ne ver conceived as conne cted are incompatible. Yet deeper drives \"Do what t hou w ilt\"; subconscious oppos itions are evoke d to visible appearance. The secr et sanctuaries of the soul are cleansed. \" Do What thou Wilt\" pur ges his every part. He has become One, one only. His Will is consequently released from {12 68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"5} the interference of internal oppos ition, a nd he is a Master of Magick. B ut for that very reason he is now utterly impotent to achieve anything that is not in absolute accordance with his Original Oath, w ith his True Will, by vi rtue w hereof he incarnated as a man. With Bill Sykes love and m urder are not mutuall y exclusive, as they are with King Arthur. The higher the type of man, the mor e sensitive he becomes; so that the nobl est love divines intuitively when a car eless word or gesture may wound, a nd, vi gilant, shuns them as being of the fami ly of murder. In M agick, likewise, the Adept who is sworn to attain to the Kno wledge and C onve rsation of his Holy Guardian Angel may in his grosser days have been expert as a Healer, to find that he is now incapable of any s uch work. H e will probably be puz zled, and w onde r whether he has lost all his pow er. Yet the cause may be no m ore than that the Wisdom of his Angel depreciates the inte rference of ignor ant kindliness with diseases which may ha ve been sent to the s ufferer for a pur pose profoundl y important to his welfare. In the case of THE MASTER THERION, he had or iginally the capacity for all clas ses of Orgia. In the beginning, H e cured the sick, be witched the obs tinate, al lured the seductive, routed the aggressive, made himself invisible, and ge neral ly be haved like a Young- Man-About -town on e very pos sible plane. He would affli ct one vampire with a Sending of Cats, and a ppoi nt another his private Enchantr ess, neither aware of any m oral oxym oron, nor hampered by t he implicit incongr u ity of his oaths. But as He advanced in Adeptship, this coltishness found i ts mouth bitted; as soon a s He took s erious Oaths and w as admitted to the Order which we name not, those Oaths prevented him using H is pow ers as playthings. Trifling ope rations , such as He onc e could do w ith a turn of the wrist, became impossible to the m ost persistent endeavour . It was many ye ars before He unde rstood t he cause of this. But little by l ittle He became so absorbed in the Work of His true Will that it no l onge r occurred to Him to indul ge in capricious amusements. Yet even at this hour , though H e be verily a Magus of A.'. A.'., though H is Word be the Word of the Aeon, t hough H e be the Beast 666, t he Lord of the Scarl et Woman \"in whom is all pow er {126} gi ven\", there are still certain Orgia beyo nd H im to pe rform, because to do s o would be to affirm what He hath de nied in t hose Oaths by w hose virtue He is That He is. This is the case, even when the s pirit of such Orgia is fully consonant with His Will. The literal sense of His original Oath insists that it shall be respected. The case offers two instances of this principle. FRATER PERDURABO specifica lly swore that he would renounc e His personal pos sessions to the last penny; al so that He would allow no hum an affection to hinder Him. These terms were acce pted; He was granted infinitely more than He had imagined pos sible to an incarn ated M an. O n the other hand, t he price offered by H im was exacted as strictly as if it had be en stipulated by S hylock. E very treasure that he had on e arth w as taken away, and that, usually, in so br utal or cruel a manner as to make the loss itself the least part of the pang. E very hum an affection that He had in His heart --- and that heart aches for Love as few hearts can ever conceive --- was torn out and trampled with such infernal ingenuity in intensifying torture that His endur ance is beyond be lief. Inexplicable are the atrocities which ac companied every step in His Initiation! Death dr agged away His children with s low savagery; the women He loved dr ank themselves into de lirium and de mentia be fore His eyes, or repaid His passionate devotion w ith toad-cold treachery at th e moment when long ye ars of loyalty ha d tempted Him to trust them. His friend, that bor e the bag, stole that which was put therein, and be trayed his Master a s thoroughl y as he was able. At the first distant rumour that the Pharisees we re out, his disciples \"all forsook H im and f led\". His mother nailed Him with h er own ha nds to the cross, and r eviled Him as nine years He hung t hereupon. Now, having e ndur ed to the end, be ing M aster of Magick, H e is mighty to Work H is true Will; which Will is, to establish on E arth His Word, the Law of Thelema . He hath none other Will than this; so all that He doth is unto this end. Al l His Orgia bear fruit; what was the work of a month when He was a full Major A dept is to da y wrought in a few minutes by t he Words of Will, uttered with the right vibrations into the prepared Ear. {127} 69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":" But neither by t he natural use of His abilities, though t hey ha ve made Him fam ous through t he whole world, nor by t he utmost might of his Magick, is He able to acquire material wealth be yond t he minimum necessary to ke ep Him alive and a t work.

Yet more awful is the doom that He hath invoke d upon H imself in renounc ing H is right as a man to enjoy the Love of those whom He loves with pa ssion s o self less, so pur e, and s o intense in return for the pow er so to love Mankind that H e be chosen to utter the Word of the Aeon f or their sake, His reward uni versal abhor rence, bodi ly torment, mental despair, and m oral paralysis.

The Magician addresses a direct petiti on to the Being invoke d. B ut the secret of success in invoc ation ha s not hithe rto be en disclosed. I t is an exceedingly simple one . It is practically of no importance whatever that the invoc ation s houl d be \"right\". There are a thous an d different ways of compassing the end pr opos ed, so far as external things are concerned. The whole secret may be summarised in these four words: \"Enflame th yself in pr aying.\" > The mind m ust be exalted unt il it loses consciousness of self. The Magician must be carried forward blindly by a force which, though i n him and of him, is by no m eans that which he in his nor mal state of consciousness calls I. Just as the poe t, the lover, the artist, is carried out of himself in a creative fre nzy, so must it be for the Magician. It is impossible to lay dow n rules for the obtaining of this special stimulu s. To one the mystery of the whole ceremony m ay appeal; another may be moved b y the strangeness of the words, even by t he fact that the \"barbarous names\" are unintelligible to him. Some times in the course of a ceremony t he true meanin g of some barbarous name that has hitherto ba ffled his analysis may flash upon him, luminous and s plendid, so that he is caught up unt o {129} or gasm. The sme ll of a particular incense may excite him effectively, or perhaps the phys ical ecstasy of the magick da nce. Every M agician must compose his ceremony i n such a manner as to pr oduc e a dr amatic cilmax. At the moment when the excitement becomes ungove rnable, when th en the whole conscious being of the Magician unde rgoes a spiritual spasm, at th 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"at moment must he utter the supreme adjuration. One very effective method i s to stop s hort, by a supreme effort of will, again and a gain, on t he very br ink of that spasm, unt il a time arrives when the idea of exercising that will fails to oc cur>. Inhibition is no l onge r pos sible or even thinkable, and the whole being of the Magician, no m inutest atom saying na y, is irresistibly flung f orth. I n blinding light, amid the roar of ten thous a nd thunde rs, the Union of God a nd m an is consummated. If the Magician is still seen standing in the Circle, qui etly pur suing hi s i nvoc ations, it is that all the conscious part of him has become detached from t he true ego w hich lies behind that nor mal consciousness. But the circle is who lly filled with that divine essence; all else is but an accident and a n illusio n. The subsequent invoc ations, the gradual developm ent and m aterialization of t he force, require no e ffort. It is one great mistake of the beginner to concen trate his force upon t he actual stated pur pose of the ceremony. This mistake i s the most frequent cause of failures in invoc ation. A corollary of this Theorem is that the Magician soon di scards evocation a lm ost altogether --- only rare circumstances demand a ny a ction w hat ever on t he m aterial plane. The Magician de votes himself entirely to the invoc ation of a go d; and a s soon a s his balance approaches perfection he ceases to invoke any pa r tial god; only that god ve rtically above him is in his path. And s o a man who perhaps took up M agick merely with the idea of acquiring know ledge, love, or we alth, finds himself irrevocably committed to the performance of \"The Great Work .\" {130} It will now be apparent that there is no di stinction be tween magick and m edi tation e xcept of the most arbitrary and a ccidental kind.>  I I Beside these ope n methods thee are also a num ber of mental methods of Invoc a tion, of which we may give three. The first method c oncerns the so-called astral body . The Magician shoul d pr actise the formation of this body a s recommended in Liber O, and learn to rise on the planes according to the instruction gi ven in the same book, t hough l imit ing hi s \"rising\" to the particular symbol whose God he wishes to invoke . The second i s to recite a mantra suitable to the God. The third is the assumption of the form of the God - -- by t ransmuting the as tral body i nto His shape. This last method i s really essential to all proper i nvoc ation, a nd c annot be too s edulously pr actised. There are many ot her devices to aid invoc ation, s o many that it is impossibl e to enum erate them; and the Magician will be wise to bus y himself in inventing new one s. We will give one example. Suppos e the Supreme Invoc ation to consist of 20 t o 30 ba rbarous names, let him imagine these names to oc cupy s ections of a vertical column, each doubl e the l ength of the preceding one ; and let him imagine that his consciousness ascends the column with each na me. The mere multiplication w ill then pr oduc e a feeling of awe and be wilderment which is the proper forerunne r of exstasy. In the essay \"Energized Enthusiasm\" in No. IX, Vol. I of the Equinox> is giv en a concise account of one of the classical methods of arousing K unda lini. Th is essay shoul d be studied with care and de termination. {131}  - ------------ {132} 71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"  C HAPTER XVI  ( \"Part II\") O F THE CHARGE TO THE SPIRIT  WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF THE C ONSTRAINTS AND CURSES OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY  I On the appearance of the spirit, or the manifestation of the force in the ta lisman which is being c onsecrated, it is necessary to bind it by a n Oath or Cha rge. A spirit shoul d be made to lay its hand vi sibly on t he weapon by w hose mi ght it has been evoke d, and to \"swear obe dience and f aith to Him that liveth an d triumpheth, that regneth above him in His palaces as the Balance of Righteous ness and Truth\" by t he names used in the evocation. It is then onl y ne cessary to formulate the Oath or Charge in langua ge harmon ious with the previously announc ed pur pose of the ope ration. The precaution indicated is not to let one self sink into one 's hum anity whil e the weapon i s extended be yond t he Circle. Were the force to flow from it to you i nstead of from you t o it, you w ould be infallibly blasted, or , at the leas t, become the slave of the spirit. At no m oment is it more important that the Divine Force shoul d not only fill , but radiate from, the aura of the Magician.  I I Occasionally it may ha ppen that the spirit is recalcitrant, and r efuses to a ppear. Let the Magician consider the cause of such disobedience! {133} It may be that the place or time is wrong. O ne cannot easily evoke water-sp irits in the Sahara, or salamanders in the English Lake District. Hismael will not readily appear when Jupiter is below the hor izon.> In or der to count eract a natural deficiency of this sort, one would ha ve to suppl y a sufficient qua nt ity of the proper kind of material. One cannot make bricks without straw. With regard to invoc ations of the Gods, such considerations do not apply. T he Gods are beyond m ost material condi tions. It is necessary to fill the \"hear t\" and \" mind\" with the proper basis for manifestation. The higher the nature o f the God, t he more true this is. The Holy Guardian Angel has always the neces sary ba sis. His manifestation de pends solely on t he readiness of the Aspirant, and a ll magical ceremonies used in that invoc ation a re merely intended to pr ep are that Aspirant; not in any w ay to attract or influence Him. It is His const ant and e ternal Will> to be come one with the Aspirant, and the moment the condi tions of the latter make it pos sible, That Bridal is consummated.  I II The obs tinacy of a spirit (or the inertial of a talisman) usually implies a defect in invoc ation. The spirit cannot resist even for a moment the constrain t of his Intelligence, when that Intelligence is working in accordance with the Will of the Angel, Archangel {134} a nd G od a bove him. It is therefore better to repeat the Invoc ations than to pr oceed at onc e to curses. The Magician shoul d also consider> whether the evocation be in truth a neces sary pa rt of the Karma of the Universe, as he has stated in his own Oath (See C 72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"ap. X VI, I). For if this be a delusion, s uccess is impossible. It will then b e best to go ba ck to the beginning, a nd r ecapitulate with gr eater intensity and pow er of analysis the Oath and the Invoc ations. And this may be done thrice. But if this be satisfactorily accomplished, and the spirit be yet disobedien t, the implication is that some hos tile force is at work to hinder the ope ratio n. I t will then be come advisable to discover the nature of that force, and to attack and de stroy it. This makes the ceremony m ore useful than ever to the Ma gician, w ho m ay thereby be led to unve il a black magical gang w hose existence h e had not hitherto suspected. His need to check the vampiring of a lady in Paris by a sorceress onc e led FR ATER PERDURABO to the discovery of a very pow erful body of black magicians, whi ch whom he was obliged to war for nearly 10 ye ars before their ruin was complet e and irremediable as it now is. Such a discovery will not necessarily impede the ceremony. A general curse may be pronounc ed against the forces hindering the ope ration ( for \"ex hypot hesi \" no di vine force can be interfering) and ha ving thus temporarily dislodge d the m --- for the pow er of the God invoke d will suffice for this pur pose --- one ma y pr oceed with a certain asperity to conjure the spirit, for that he has done i ll to be nd be fore the conjurations of the Black Brothers. Indeed, some demons are of a nature such that they onl y unde rstand c urses, are not amenable to courteous command: ---  \" a slave Whom stripes may move, not kindne ss.\" Finally, as a last resource, one may bur n the Sigil of the {135} S pirit in a black box w ith stinking s ubstances, all having be en pr operly pr epared be foreha nd, a nd the magical links properly made, so that he is really tortured by t he O peration.> This is a rare event, how ever. Only onc e in the whole of his magical career was FRATER PERDURABO driven to so ha rsh a measure.  I V In this conne xion, be ware of too r eady a compliance on t he part of the spiri t. If some Black Lodge has got wind of your ope ration, i t may send the spirit, full of hypoc ritical subm ission, t o de stroy you. S uch a spirit will probably pronounc e the oath amiss, or in some way seek to avoid his obligations. It is a dangerous trick, though, f or the Black Lodge to play; for if the spi rit come properly unde r your control, it will be forced to disclose the transac tion, a nd the current will return to the Black Lodge with fulminating f orce. T he liars will be in the pow er of their own lie; their own slaves will rise up a nd put them into bonda ge. The wicked fall into the pit that they themselves di gged. And s o pe rish all the King's enemies!  V The charge to the spirit is usually embodi ed, except in works of pur e evocat ion, w hich after all are comparatively rare, in some kind of talisman. I n a ce rtain sense, the talisman is the Charge expressed in hieroglyphi cs. Yet, every object soever is a talisman, for the definition of a talisman is: something up on w hich an act of will (that is, of Magick) has been pe rformed in or der to fit it for a pur pose. Repeated acts of will in respect of {136} a ny obj ect consec rate it without further ado. O ne know s what miracles can be done with one 's fa vour ite mashie! One has used the mashie again and a gain, one 's love for it gro wing in pr opor tion to one 's success with it, and that success again made more c ertain and c omplete by t he effect of this \"love unde r will\", which one bestows upon i t by us ing it. It is, of course, very important to ke ep such an abject away from the contac t of the profane. It is instinctive not to let another person us e one 's fishin g rod or one 's gun.

Of course, the outstanding e xample of all such talismans is the wife. A wife may be defined as an obj ect specially pr epared for taking the stamp of one 's cr eative will. This is an example of a very complicated magical ope ration, e xten ding ove r centuries. But, theoretically, it is just an or dinary case of talism anic magick. I t is for this reason that so much troubl e has been taken to pr ev ent a wife having c ontact with the profane; or, at least, to try to pr event her . Readers of the Bible will remember that Absalom publ icly adopt ed David's wiv es and c oncubines on t he roof of the palace, in or der to signify that he had su cceeded in br eaking hi s father's magical pow er. Now, there are a great many talismans in this world which are being left lyi ng a bout in a most reprehensibly careless manner. Such are the objects of popu lar adoration, a s ikons , and idols. But, it is actually true that a great deal of real magical Force is locked up i n such things; consequently, by de stroying these sacred symbols, you c an ove rcome magically the people who a dore them. It is not at all irrational to fight for one 's flag, pr ovided that the flag is an obj ect which really means something to somebody . Similarly, with the mos t widely spread and m ost devotedly worshipped talisman of all, money, you c an evidently br eak the magical will of a worshipper of money by t aking hi s money a way from him, or by de stroying its value in some way or another. But, in the c ase of money, general experience tells us that there is very little of it lying about loose. In this case, above all, {137} pe ople have recogni sed its talism anic virtue, that is to say, its pow er as an instrument of the will. But with many ikons and images, it is easy to steal their virtue. This can be done sometimes on a tremendous scale, as, for example, when all the images o f Isis and H orus, or similar mother-child combinations, were appropriated whole sale by t he Christians. The miracle is, how ever, of a somewhat dangerous type, as in this case, where enlightenment has come through t he researches of archae ologists. It has been show n that the so-called images of Mary and J esus are re ally not hing but imitations of those of Isis and H orus. Honesty is the best po licy in M agick as in other lines of life.  - -------- {138}  C HAPTER XVII O F THE LICENSE TO DEPART After a ceremony ha s reached its climax, anti-climax must inevitably follow. But if the ceremony ha s been successful this anti-climax is merely formal. T he Magician shoul d rest permanently on t he higher plain to which he has aspired .> The whole force of the ope ration s houl d be absorbed; but there is almost ce rtain to be a residuum , since no ope ration is perfect: and ( even if it were so) there would be a num ber of things, sympathetic to the ope ration, a ttracted to the Circle. These must be duly dispersed, or they will degenerate and be come e vil. It is always easy to do t his where invoc ations are concerned; the mere re moval of the strain imposed by t he will of the magician will restore things to their nor mal aspects, in accordance with the great law of inertia. In a badly- managed evocation, how ever, this doe s not always obtain; the spirit may refuse 74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"to be controlled, and m ay refuse to de part --- even after having s worn obe dienc e. In such a case extreme danger may arise. In the ordinary way, the Magician dismisses the spirit with these words: \"An d now I say unt o thee, depart in pe ace unto thine habitations and a bode s --- an d may the blessing of the Highest be upon t hee in the name of (here mention the divine name suitable to the ope ration, or a Name appropriate to redeem that sp irit); and let there be peace between thee and m e; and be thou ve ry ready to co me, whensoever thou a re invoke d and c alled!\"> {139} Shoul d he fail to disappear immediately, it is a sign that there is somethin g ve ry wrong. The Magician shoul d immediately reconsecrate the Circle with the utmost care. He shoul d then repeat the dismissal; and if this doe s not suffic e, he shoul d then pe rform the banishing r itual suitable to the nature of the sp irit and, i f necessary, add c onjurations to the same effect. In these circumst ances, or if anything e lse suspicious shoul d oc cur, he shoul d not be content wi th the apparent disappearance of the spirit, who m ight easily make himself invi sible and lie in ambush to do t he Magician a mischief when he stepped out of th e Circle --- or even months afterwards. Any s ymbol which ha s onc e definitely entered your environm ent with your own consent is extremely da ngerous; unless unde r absolute control. A man's friends are more capable of working hi m harm than are strangers; and hi s greatest dang er lies in his own ha bits. Of course it is the very condi tion of progress to bui ld up i deas into the su bconscious. The necessity of selection s houl d therefore be obvi ous. True, there comes a time when all elements soever must be thus assimilated. Samadhi is, by de finition, t hat very pr ocess. But, from the point of view of the young m agician, there is a right way --- strait and di fficult --- of perfor ming a ll this. One cannot too f requently repeat that what is lawful and pr oper to one Path is alien to another. Immediately after the License to Depart, and the general closing up of the wo rk, it is necessary that the Magician shoul d sit dow n and w rite up hi s magical record. H owever much he may ha ve been tired> by t he ceremony, he ought to forc e himself to do t his until it becomes a habit. Verily, it is better to fail in the magical ceremony t han to fail in writing dow n an accurate record of it. O ne need not doubt the propriety of this remark. E ven if one is eaten alive by Malkah be -Tarshishim ve-Ruachoth ha -Schehalim, it doe s not matter very much, fo r it is ove r so ve ry qui ckly. But the record of the transactions is {140} ot he rwise important. Nobody c ares about Duncan ha ving be en murdered by M acbeth. I t is only one of a num ber of similar murders. But Shakespeare's account of the incident is a unique treasure of mankind. And, a part from the que stion of the value to others, there is that of the value to the magician himself. The reco rd of the magician is his best asset. It is as foolish to do M agick without method, a s if it were anything e lse. To do M agick without keeping a record is like trying to run a bus iness without book- keeping. There are a great many pe ople who qui te misunde rstand the nature of Magick. They ha ve an idea that it is something va gue and unr eal, instead o f being, a s it is, a direct means of coming into contact with reality. It is t hese people who pa y themselves with phr ases, who a re always using long w ords wi th no de finite connot ation, w ho pl aster themselves with pom pous titles and de co rations which mean not hing w hatever. With such pe ople we have nothing to do. But to those who s eek reality the Key of Magick is offered, and they are hereby warned that the key to the treasure-hous e is no good w ithout the combination; and the combination is the magical record. From one point of view, magical progress actually consists in de ciphering on e's own record.> For this reason it is the most important thing to do, on s tri ctly magical grounds . But apart from this, it is absolutely essential that the record shoul d be clear, full and c oncise, because it is only by s uch a record that your teacher can judge how it is best to he lp you. Your magical teacher h as something e lse to do be sides runni ng a round a fter you a ll the time, and the most important of all his functions is that of auditor. Now, if you c all in an auditor to investigate a bus iness, and w hen he asks for the books you t ell him 75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" that you ha ve not thought it worth while to ke ep any, you ne ed not be surprise d if he thinks you e very kind of an ass.

I t goe s far to justify the belief of the semi-educated that Magick is rather a crazy affair after all. Ho wever, there are none of these half-baked lunatics conne cted with the A.'.

It is of course not \"real \"; but then no m ore is the other body! Before treating of clairvoya nce one mus t discuss briefly this que stion of reality, for misapprehension on t he subject has given rise to endless troubl e. There is the story of the American in the train who s aw another American car rying a basket of unus ual shape. His curiosity mastered him, and he leant acro ss and s aid: \"Say, stranger, what you got in that bag?\" The other, lantern-ja wed and taciturn, replied: \"mongoos e\". The first man was rather baffled, as he had ne ver heard of a mongoos e. After a pause he pur sued, at the risk of a reb uff: \"But say, what is a Mongoos e?\" \"Mongoos e eats snakes\", replied the other. This was another pos er, but he pur sued: \"What in he ll do you w ant a Mongoos e for?\" \"Well, you s ee\", said the second m an (in a confidential whisper) \"my br o ther sees snakes\". The first man was more puz zled than ever; but after a long think, he continued rather pathetically: \"But say, them ain't real snakes\". \"S ure\", said the man with the basket, \"but this Mongoos e ain't real either\". This is a perfect parable of Magick. There is no s uch thing {143} a s truth in the perceptible universe; every idea when analysed is found t o contain a con tradiction. I t is quite useless (except as a temporary expedient) to set up on e class of ideas against another as being \" more real\". The advance of man towa rds God is not necessarily an advance towards truth. All philosophi cal systems have crumbled. B ut each class of ideas pos sesses true relations within itself . It is pos sible, with Berkeley,> to de ny the existence of water and of wood; but, for all that, wood f loats on w ater. The Magician be comes identical with t he immortal Osiris, yet the Magician dies. In this dilemma the facts must be r estated. O ne shoul d pr eferably say that the Magician be comes conscious of that part of himself which he calls the immortal Osiris; and that Part doe s not \"di 76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"e\". Now this interior body of the Magician, of which we spoke at the beginning o f this chapter, doe s exist, and c an exert certain pow ers which his natural body cannot do. I t can, for example, pass through \" matter\", and it can move freely in every direction through s pace. But this is because \"matter\", in the sense in which we commonly us e the word, is on a nother plane>. Now this fine body pe rceives a universe which we do not ordinarily pe rceive. It doe s not necessarily pe rceive the universe which we do nor mally pe rceive, so although i n this body I can pa ss through t he roof, it doe s not follow that I shall be able to tell what the weather is like. I might do s o, or I might not : but if I could not , it would not prove that I was deceiving m yself in suppos i ng that I had pa ssed through t he roof. This body , which is called by va rious a uthors the Astral doubl e, body of Light, body of fire, body of desire, fine bod y, scin-laeca and num berless other names is naturally fitted to pe rceive object s of its own class ... in pa rticular, the pha ntoms of the astral plane. {144} There is some sort of vague and indeterminate relation be tween the Astrals a nd the Materials; and it is pos sible, with gr eat experience, to de duce facts ab out material things from the astral aspect which they pr esent to the eyes of th e Body of Light.> This astral plane is so va ried and s o changeable that severa l clairvoya nts looki ng a t the same thing m ight give totally different account s of what they saw; yet they might each make correct deductions. In looki ng a t a man the first clairvoya nt might say: \"The lines of force are all droopi ng\"; th e second: \"It seems all dirty and s potty\"; a third; \"The Aura looks very ragged .\" Yet all might agree in de ducing that the man was in ill-health. I n any c ase all such de ductions are rather unr eliable. One must be a highly skilled man b efore one can trust one 's vision. A great many pe ople think that they are extr emely good a t the bus iness, when in fact they ha ve only made some occasional sh rewd gue sses (which they na turally remember) in the course of hundr eds of forgo tten failures. The only way to test clairvoya nce is to ke ep a careful record of every exper iment made. For example, FRATER O. M. onc e gave a clairvoya nt a waistcoat to p sychom etrize. He made 56 s tatements about the owner of the waistcoat; of these 4 w ere notably right; 17, t hough c orrect, were of that class of statement whic h is true of almost everybody . The remainder were wrong. I t was concluded fro m this that he show ed no e vidence of any s pecial pow er. In fact, his bodi ly ey es, --- if he could discern Tailoring - -- would ha ve served him better, for he thought the owner of the vest was a corn-chandler, instead of an earl, as he is . The Magician can ha rdly take too m uch troubl e to de velop this pow er in himse lf. It is extremely us eful to him in gua rding hi mself against attack; in obt ai ning w arnings, in judgi ng c haracter, and e specially in watching the process of his Ceremonies. {145} There are a great many w ays of acquiring the pow er. Gaze into a crystal, or into a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, or into a mirror, or into a teacup . Just as with a microscope the expert ope rator keeps both eyes ope n, though s eeing onl y through t he one at the eye-piece of the instrument, so the natural e yes, ceasing to give any m essage to the brain, the attention is withdrawn from them, and the man be gins to see through t he Astral eyes. These methods appear to The MASTER THERION to be uns atisfactory. Very of ten they do not work at all. It is difficult to teach a person to us e these metho ds; and, w orst of all, they are pur ely pa ssive! You c an see only what is shewn you, a nd you a re probably shewn things perfectly poi ntless and irrelevant. The proper method i s as follows: --- Develop the body of Light until it is jus t as real to you a s your other body , teach it to travel to any de sired symbol, and e nable it to pe rform all necessary Rites and I nvoc ations. In short, educat e it. Ultimately, the relation of that body w ith your own must be exceedingly intimate; but before this harmonizing takes place, you s houl d be gin by a carefu l differentiation. The first thing to do, t herefore, is to ge t the body out sid e your own. To avoid muddl ing the two, you be gin by i magining a shape resembli ng your self standing in front of you. D o not say: \"Oh, it's only imagination!\" 77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" The time to test that is later on, w hen you ha ve secured a fairly clear menta l image of such a body . Try to imagine how your own body w ould look i f you w er e standing in its place; try to transfer your consciousness to the Body of Ligh t. Your own body ha s its eyes shut. Use the eyes of the Body of Light to de sc ribe the objects in the room behind you. D on't say. \"It's only an effort of su bconscious memory\" ... the time to test that is later on. As soon a s you f eel more or less at hom e in the fine body , let it rise in th e air. Keep on f eeling the sense of rising; keep on l ooki ng a bout you a s you r ise until you s ee landscapes or beings of the astral plane. Such ha ve a qua lit y all their own. They are not like material things --- they are not like menta l pictures --- they seem to lie between the two. After some practice has made you a dept, so that in the course {146} of any h our's journey you c an reckon on ha ving a fairly eventful time, turn your attent ion to reaching a definite place on t he astral plane; invoke Mercury, for examp le, and e xamine carefully your record of the resulting vi sion - -- discover whet her the symbols which you ha ve seen correspond w ith the conve ntional symbols of Mercury. This testing of the spirits is the most important branch of the whole tree o f Magick. Without it, one is lost in the jungl e of delusion. E very spirit, up to God hi mself, is ready to de ceive you i f pos sible, to make himself out more important than he is; in short to lay in wait for your soul in 333 s eparate way s. Remember that after all the highest of all the Gods is only the Magus,> May an, the greatest of all the devils. You m ay also try \"rising on t he planes\".> With a little practice, especiall y if you ha ve a good G uru, you ought to be able to slip in and out of your astr al body a s easily as you s lip in and out of a dressing-gow n. I t will then no l onge r be so ne cessary for your astral body t o be sent far off; without moving a n inch you w ill be able to \"turn on\" its eyes and e ars --- as simply as the man with the microscope (mentioned above ) can transfer his complete attention f rom one eye to the other. Now, how ever uns uccessful your getting out the body m ay apparently ha ve been, it is most necessary to us e every effort to br ing it properly ba ck. M ake the B ody of Light coincide in space with the phys ical body , assume the God-Form, and vibrate the name of Harpocrates with the utmost energy; then recover unity of consciousness. If you f ail to do t his properly you m ay find your self in seriou s troubl e. Your Body of Light may wander away unc ontrolled, and be attacked an d obs essed. You w ill become aware of this through t he occurrence of headache, bad dr eams, or even more serious signs such as hys teria, fainting f its, pos sibl y madness or paralysis. Even the worst of these attacks will probably wear off , but it may leave you pe rmanently da maged to a greater or less extent. {147} A great majority of \"spiritualists\", \"occultists\", \"Toshosophi sts\", are piti able examples of repeated losses from this cause. The emotional type of religionist also suffers in this way. Devotion pr ojec ts the fine body , which is seized and va mpirized by t he demon m asquerading a s \" Christ\" or \"Mary\", or whoever may be the object of worship. C omplete absence o f all pow er to concentrate thought , to follow an argum ent, to formulate a Will, to hol d fast to an opi nion or a course of action, or even to ke ep a solemn oa t h, m ark indelibly those who ha ve thus lost parts of their souls. They wander f rom one new cult to another even crazier. Occasionally such pe rsons drift for a moment into the surroundi ng of The MASTER THERION, and a re shot out by t he si mple process of making them try to do a half-hour 's hone st work of any ki nd. In pr ojecting the Astral, it is a valuable additional safeguard to pe rform t he whole ope ration in a properly consecrated circle. Proceed with gr eat caution, t hen, but proceed. I n time your Body of Light wil l be as strong a gainst spirits as your other body a gainst the winds of Heaven. All depends upon t he developm ent of that Body of Light. It must be furnished with an or ganism as ramified and ba lanced as its shadow y br other, the material body . To recapitulate onc e more, then, the first task is to de velop your own Body of light within your own circle without reference to any ot her inhabitants of t 78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"he world to which it belongs . That which you ha ve accomplished with the subject you m ay now proceed to do w i th the object. You w ill learn to see the astral appearance of material things; and a lthough t his doe s not properly be long t o pur e clairvoya nce, one may he re again mention that you s houl d endeavour to the utmost to de velop a nd f ortify th is Body of Light. The best and s implest way to do t his is to us e it constantly , to exercise it in every way. In pa rticular it may be employed in ceremonies of initiation or of invoc ation - -- while the phys ical body r emains silent and s till. In doi ng this it will often be necessary to create a Temple on t he astral pl ane. It is excellent practice to create symbols. This one precaution is neede d: after using them, they shoul d be reabsorbed. {148} Having learned to create astral forms, the next step will be at first very d ifficult. Phantasmal and f leeting a s the astral is in ge neral, those forms whi ch are definitely attached to the material pos sess enormous pow ers of resistanc e, and it consequently requires very high pot ential to influence them. The mat erial analogue s seem to serve as a fortress. Even where a temporary effect is produc ed, the inertia of matter draws it back to the nor mal; yet the pow er of t he trained and c onsecrated will in a well-developed astral body i s such that it can even pr oduc e a permanent change in the material upon w hose Body of Light y ou a re working, e .g.; one can he al the sick by r estoring a healthy a ppearance t o their astral forms. On the other hand, i t is pos sible so to disintegrate the Body of Light even of a strong m an that he will fall dead. Such ope rations demand not only pow er, but judgm ent. Nothing c an ups et the sum total of destiny - -- everything m ust be paid for the uttermost farthing. F or this reason a great many ope rations theoretically pos sible cannot be perform ed. S uppos e, for example, you s ee two men of similarly unhe althy a stral appear ance. In one case the cause may be slight and temporary. Your help suffices t o restore him in a few minutes. The other, who looks no w orse, is really oppr e ssed by a force incalculably gr eater than you c ould control, and you w ould onl y damage your self by a ttempting to he lp him. The diagnos is between the two case s could be made by a n investigation of the deeper strata of the astral, such as compose the\"causal body\" . A body of black magicians unde r Anna Kingsford> onc e attempted to kill a viv isector who w as not particularly well know n; and they succeeded in making hi m s eriously ill. But in attempting the same thing w ith Pasteur they pr oduc ed no e ffect whatever, because Pasteur was a great genius --- an adept in his own line far greater than she in he rs --- and be cause millions of people were daily ble ssing hi m. It cannot be too c learly unde rstood t hat magical force is subject t o the same laws of propor tion a s any ot her kind of force. It is useless for a mere millionaire to try to ba nkrupt a man who ha s the Bank of England be hind hi m. {149} To sum up, t he first task is to separate the astral form from the phys ical b ody, the second t o de velop the pow ers of the astral body , in pa rticular those o f sight, travel, and interpretation; third, to uni fy the two bodi es without mud dling them. This being a ccomplished, the magician is fitted to de al with the invisible.  I I It is now useful to contine with considerations of other planes, which ha ve commonly be en classed unde r the Astral. There is some reason f or this, as the delimitations are somewhat vague. Just as the vegetable kingdom merges into th e animal, and a s the material plane has beings which encroach upon t he bounda ri es of the astral, so do w e find it in the higher planes. The mental images which appear dur ing m editation a re subjective, and pe rtain not at all to the astral plane. Only ve ry rarely do a stral images occur dur in g meditation. I t is a bad br eak in the circle, as a rule, when they do. There is also a Magical Plane. This touches the material, and e ven includes a por tion of it. It includes the Astral, chiefly a full-bloode d type of the A 79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"stral. It reaches to and includes most, if not all, of the spiritual planes. The Magical plane is thus the most comprehensive of all. Egypt ian Gods are typical inhabitants of this plane, and it is the hom e of every Adept. The spiritual planes are of several types, but are all distingui shed by a re ality and intensity to be found now here else. Their inhabitants are formless, free of space and time, and di stingui shed by i ncomparable brilliance. There are also a num ber of sub-planes, as, for example, the Alchemical. Thi s plane will often appear in the practice of \"Rising on t he Planes\"; its images are usually those of gardens curiously ke pt, mount ains furnished with pe culiar symbols, hieroglyphi c animals, or such figures as that of the \"Hermetic Arcanu m\", and pi ctures like the \"Goldseekers\" and the \"Massacre of the Innoc ents\" of Basil Valentine. There is a unique qua lity about the alchemical Plane which re nders its images immediately recogni zable. {150} There are also planes correspondi ng to va rious religions past and pr esent, a ll of which ha ve their peculiar unity. It is of the utmost importance to the \"Clairvoya nt\" or \"traveler in the fine body\" to be able to find hi s way to any de sired plane, and ope rate therein as its ruler. The Neophyt e of A.'. A.'. is examined most strictly in this practice before he is passed to the degree of Zelator. In \"Rising on t he Planes\" one must usually pa ss clear through t he Astral to the Spiritual. Some will be una ble to do t his. The \"fine body\" which is good enough t o subsist on l ower planes, a shadow among s hadow s, will fail to pe netra te the higher strata. It requires a great developm ent of this body , and a n int ense infusion of the highest spiritual constituents of man, be fore he can pierc e the veils. The constant practice of Magick is the best preparation pos sible. Even though t he hum an consciousness fail to reach the goa l, the consciousness of the fine body i tself may do s o, w herefore whoso travels in that body on a s ubsequent occasion m ay be found w orthy; and its success will react favour ably o n the hum an consciousness, and increase its likelihood of success in its next m agical ope ration. Similarly, the pow ers gained in this way will strengthen the magician in his mediation-practices. His Will becomes better able to assist the concentration , to de stroy the mental images which disturb it, and to reject the lesser rewar ds of that practice which tempt, and too of ten stop the progress of, the mystic . Although i t is said that the spiritual lies \"beyond t he astral\", this is the oretical;> the advanced M agician will not find it to be so in pr actice. He wil l be able by s uitable invoc ation to travel directly to any pl ace desired. I n L iber 418 a n example of perfection is given. The Adept who e xplored these Aethy rs did not have to pa ss through a nd be yond t he Universe, the whole of which ye t lies within even the inmost (30th) Aethyr. He was able to summon the Aethyrs he wanted, and H is chief difficulty was that sometimes {151} H e was at first un able to pierce their veils. In fact, as the Book s how s, it was only by vi rtue of successive and m ost exalted initiations unde rgone in the Aethyrs themselves that He was able to pe netrate beyond t he 15th. The Guardians of such fortresse s know how to gua rd. The MASTER THERION has publ ished the most important practical magical secret s in the plainest langua ge. No one , by vi rtue of being c lever or learned, ha s unde rstood one word; and those unw orthy w ho ha ve profaned the sacrament have bu t eaten and dr unke n da mnation to themselves. One may br ing dow n stolen fire in a hollow tube from Heaven, as The MASTER T HERION indeed ha s done in a way that no ot her adept dared to do be fore him.

I II The practice of Rising on t he Planes is of such importance that special atte ntion m ust be paid to it. It is part of the essential technique of Magick. I n struction in this practice has been given with such conciseness in Liber O, tha t one cannot do be tter than quot e verbatim (the \"previous experiment\" referred to in the first sentence is the ordinary astral journey.): \"1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of i mportance. But it is susceptible of a developm ent which merges into a form of Dharana --- concentration - -- and a s such may lead to the very highest ends.

If he shoul d find that he has stoppe d without willing to do s o, and that figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them. Yea, though hi s ve ry life tremble on hi s lips, let him force his way upw ard and onw ard! \"5. L et him continue in this so long a s the breath of life is in him. What ever threatens, whatever allures, though i t were Typhon a nd a ll his hos ts loose d from the pit and leagued against him, though i t were from the very Throne of God hi mself that a voice issues bidding hi m stay and be content, let him strugg le on, e ver on. \"6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed up i n fatigue, ove rwhelmed by i ts own inertia. Let him sink ( when no l onge r can he strive, though hi s tongue be bitten through w ith the effort and the blood gus h from his nos trils) into the blackness of unc onsciousness; and then on c oming t o himself, let him write dow n soberly and a ccurately a record of all that hath occurred: yea, a record of all that hath oc curred.\" Of course, the Rising m ay be done from any s tarting pi nt. One can go ( for e xample) into the circle of Jupiter, and the results, especially in the lower pl anes, will be very different to those obtained from a Saturnian starting poi nt. The student shoul d unde rtake a regular series of such experiments, in or der to familiarise himself not only with the nature of the different spheres, but w ith the inner meaning of each. O f course, it is not necessary in every case to pus h the {154} pr actice to exhaustion, a s described in the instructions, but t his is the proper thing to do w henever definitely pr actising, i n or der to acqui re the pow er of Rising. B ut, having obt ained this pow er, it is, of course, leg itimate to rise to any pa rticular plane that may be necessary for the pur pose o f exploration, a s in the case of the visions recorded in Liber 418, w here the m ethod m ay be described as mixed. I n such a case, it is not enough t o invoke th e place you w ish to visit, because you m ay not be able to endur e its pressure, or to br eathe its atmosphere. Several instances occur in that record where the seer was una ble to pa ss through c ertain ga teways, or to remain in certain cont emplations. He had to unde rgo c ertain Initiations before he was able to pr ocee 81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"d. Thus, it is necessary that the technique of Magick shoul d be perfected. Th e Body of Light must be rendered capable of going e verywhere and doi ng e verythi ng. I t is, therefore, always the que stion of drill which is of importance. Yo u ha ve got to go out Rising on t he Planes every da y of your life, year after ye ar. You a re not to be disheartened by f ailure, or too m uch encouraged by s ucce ss, in any one practice or set of practices. What you a re doing is what will b e of real value to you i n the end; and that is, developing a character, creatin g a Karma, which will give you t he pow er to do your will.  I V Divination is so important a branch of Magick as almost to de mand a separate treatise. Genius is composed of two sides; the active and the passive. The pow er to exe cute the Will is but blind f orce unless the Will be enlightened. At every stag e of a Magical Operation it is necessary to know what one is doing, a nd to be s ure that one is acting w isely. Acute sensitiveness is always associated with g enius; the pow er to pe rceive the universe accurately, to analyse, coordinate, a nd judge impressions is the founda tion of all great Work. An army is but a blu ndering br ute unless its intelligence department works as it shoul d. The Magician obt ains the transcendental know ledge necessary to an intelligen t course of conduc t directly in consciousness by c lairvoya nce and c lairaudience ; but communication w ith superior {155} i ntelligences demands elaborate prepara tion, e ven after years of successful performance. It is therefore useful to pos sess an art by w hich one can obt ain at a moment 's notice any information that may be necessary. This art is divination. The answers to one 's que stions in divination a re not conve yed directly but through the medium of a suitable series of symbols. These symbols must be interpreted by the diviner in terms of his problem. It is not practicable to construct a l exicon in which the solution of every difficulty is given in so many w ords. It would be unw ieldy; besides, nature doe s not happen to work on t hose lines. The theory of any pr ocess of divination m ay be stated in a few simple terms. 1. We pos tulate the existence of intelligences, either within or without the diviner, of which he is not immediately conscious. (It doe s not matter to the theory whether the communicating s pirit so-called is an obj ective entity or a c oncealed por tion of the diviner's mind.) We assume that such intelligences are able to reply correctly --- within limits --- to the que stions asked. 2. We pos tulate that it is pos sible to construct a compendium of hieroglyphs sufficiently elastic in meaning to include every pos sible idea, and that one o r more of these may always be taken to represent any idea. We assume that any of these hieroglyphi cs will be unde rstood by t he intelligences with whom we wis h to communicate in the same sense as it is by our selves. We have therefore a sort of langua ge. One may compare it to a \"lingua franca\" which is perhaps def ective in expressing f ine shades of meaning, a nd s o is uns uitable for literatur e, but which ye t serves for the conduc t of daily affairs in places where many t ongue s are spoke n. H indus tani is an example of this. But better still is the analogy be tween the conve ntional signs and s ymbols employed by m athematicians, who c an thus conve y their ideas perfectly> without speaking a word of each othe r's langua ges. {156} 3. We pos tulate that the intelligences whom wish to consul are willing, or m ay be compelled, to answer us truthfully. Let us first consider the que stion of the compendium of symbols. The alphab et of a langua ge is a more or less arbitrary way of transcribing the sounds emp loyed in speaking it. The letters themselves have not necessarily any m eaning as such. B ut in a system of divination e ach symbol stands for a definite idea. It would not interfere with the English langua ge to add a few new letters. I n fact, some systems of shorthand ha ve done so. B ut a system of symbols suitab le for divination m ust be a complete representation of the Universe, so that ea ch is absolute, and the whole insusceptible to increase or diminution. I t is ( in fact) technically a pantacle in the fullest sense of the word. 82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" Let us consider some prominent examples of such system. We may obs erve that a common m ode of divination is to inqui re of books by pl acing the thum b at ran dom within the leaves. The Books of the Sybil, the works of Vergil, and the Bi ble have been us ed ve ry frequently for this pur pose. For theoretical justifica tion, one must assume that the book e mployed is a perfect representation of the Universe. But even if this were the case, it is an inferior form of construct ion, be cause the only reasonable conception of the Cosmos is mathematical and h ieroglyphi c rather than literary. In the case of a book, s uch as the Book of t he Law which is the supreme truth and the perfect rule of life, it is not repug nant to good s ense to de rive an or acle from its pages. It will of course be re marked that the Book of the Law is not merely a literary compilation but a comp lex mathematical structure. It therefore fulfils the required condi tions. The principal means of divination in history are astrology, geomancy, the Ta rot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King. There are hundr eds of others; from pyr omancy, one iromancy, augur ies from sacrifices, and the spinning-top of some anc ient oracles to the omens drawn from the flight of birds and the prophe sying of tea-leaves. It will be sufficient for our present pur pose to discuss only the five systems first enum erated. ASTROLOGY is theoretically a perfect method, s ince the symbols employed actu ally exist in the macrocosm, and thus pos sess a {157} na tural corresponde nce wi th microcosmic affairs. But in pr actice the calculations invol ved are ove rwhel mingly complicated. A hor oscope is never complete. It needs to be suppl emente d by i nnum erable other hor oscopes. For example, to obt ain a judgm ent on t he si mplest que stion, one requires not only the nativities of the people invol ved, s ome of which are probably inaccessible, but seconda ry figures for directions an d transits, together with pr ogressed hor oscopes, to say not hing of prenatal, mu ndane, and e ven hor ary figures. To appreciate the entire mass of data, to ba la nce the elements of so va st a concourse of forces, and to dr aw a single judgm en t therefrom, is a task pr actically be yond hum an capacity. Besides all this, th e actual effects of the planetary pos itions and a spects are still almost entire ly unknow n. N o two astrologers agree on a ll points; and m ost of them are at od ds on f unda mental principles.> This science had be tter be discarded unl ess the student chances to feel strongl y dr awn toward it. It is used by t he MASTER TH ERION Himself with fairly satisfactory results, but only in special cases, in a strictly limited sphere, and w ith pa rticular precautions. Even so, H e feels g reat diffidence in ba sing H is conduc t on t he result so obt ained. GEOMANCY has the advantage of being r igorously mathematical. A hand-book of the science is to be found i n Equinox I , II. The objection to its use lies in the limited num ber of the symbols. To represent the Universe by no m ore than 16 c ombinations throws too m uch work upon t hem. There is also a great restrict ion a rising f rom the fact that although 15 s ymbols appear in the final figure, there are, in reality, but 4, the remaining 1 1 be ing dr awn by a n ineluctable pr ocess from the \"Mothers\". It may be added that the tables given in the handboo k for the interpretation of the figure are exceedingly va gue on t he one hand, a nd insufficiently comprehensive on t he other. Some Adepts, how ever, appear to find this system admirable, and obt ain gr eat satisfaction f rom its use. Once m ore, the personal equation m ust be allowed full weight. At one time the MASTER THERION employed it extensively; but He was never wholly at ease with it; He f ound t he {158} i nterpretation ve ry difficult. M oreover, it seemed to Him that the geomantic intelligences themselves were of a low order, the scope of which was confined to a small section of the things which interested Him; also, they possessed a point of view of their own which was far from sympathetic with His, so that misunde rstanding c onstantly interfered with the Work. THE TAROT and THE HOLY QABALAH may be discussed together. The theoretical bas is of both is identical: The Tree of Life.> The 78 s ymbols of the Tarot are adm irably ba lanced and c ombined. They are adequate to all demands made upon t hem; each symbol is not only mathematically pr ecise, but pos sesses an artistic sign ificance which he lps the diviner to unde rstand them by s timulating hi s aestheti c perceptions. The MASTER THERION finds that the Tarot is infallible in materi al que stions. The successive ope rations describe the course of events with ast 83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"onishing w ealth of detail, and the judgm ents are reliable in all respects. But a proper divination m eans at least two hour s' hard work, even by t he improved method de veloped by H im from the traditions of initiates. Any a ttempt to short en the proceedings leads to disappoi ntment; furthermore, the symbols do not len d themselves readily to the solution of spiritual que stions. The Holy Qabalah, ba sed as it is on pur e num ber, evidently pos sesses an infi nite num ber of symbols. Its scope is conterminous with existence itself; and i t lacks nothing in pr ecision, pur ity, or indeed in any ot her perfection. B ut i t cannot be taught ;> each man must select for himself the materials for the mai n structure of his system. It requires years of work to erect a worthy bui ldin g. S uch a building is never finished; every da y spent on i t adds new ornaments . The Qabalah is therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost. It is the man h imself and hi s universe expressed in terms of thought whose {159} l angua ge is s o rich that even the letters of its alphabet have no l imit. This system is so sublime that it is uns uited to the solution of the petty puz zles of our earthly existence. In the light of the Qabalah, the shadow s of transitory things are instantly ba nished. The YI KING is the most satisfactory system for general work. The MASTER TH ERION is engaged in the preparation of a treatise on t he subject, but the labou r invol ved is so gr eat that He cannot pledge Himself to ha ve it ready a t any de finite time. The student must therefore make his own investigations into the m eaning of the 64 he xagrams as best he can. The Yi King is mathematical and phi losophi cal in form. Its structure is cog nate with that of the Qabalah; the identity is so intimate that the existence o f two such superficially different systems is transcendent testimony t o the tru th of both. I t is in some ways the most perfect hieroglyph e ver constructed. It is austere and s ublime, yet withal so adaptable to every pos sible emergency that its figures may be interpreted to suit all classes of que stions. One may resolve the most obs cure spiritual difficulties no l ess than the most munda ne d ilemmas; and the symbol which ope ns the gates of the most exalted pa laces of in itiation is equally effective when employed to advise one in the ordinary bus in ess of life. The MASTER THERION has found t he Yi King e ntirely satisfactory in every respect. The intelligences which direct it show no i nclination to evade the que stion or to mislead the que rent. A further advantage is that the actua l apparatus is simple. Also the system is easy to manipulate, and f ive minutes is sufficient to obt ain a fairly de tailed answer to any but the most obs cure q uestions. With regard to the intelligences whose bus iness it is to give information to the diviner, their natures differ widely, and c orrespond m ore or less to the c haracter of the medium of divination. Thus, the geomantic intelligences are gn omes, spirits of an earthy na ture, distingui shed from each other by t he modific ations due to the various planetary and z odiacal influences which pe rtain to th e several symbols. The intelligence gove rning P uella is not to be confused wit h that of Venus or of Libra. It is simply a particular terrestrial daemon w hic h pa rtakes of those natures. {160} The Tarot, on t he other hand, be ing a book, i s unde r Mercury, and the intell igence of each card is funda mentally M ercurial. Such symbols are therefore pec uliarly pr oper to communicate thought . They are not gross, like the geomantic daemons; but, as against this, they are uns crupul ous in de ceiving the diviner.> The Yi King is served by be ings free from these defects. The intense pur ity of the symbols prevent them from being us urped by i ntelligences with an axe of their own to gr ind.> It is always essential for the diviner to obt ain absolute magical control ov er the intelligences of the system which he adopt s. He must not leave the smal lest loop- hole for being tricked, be fogge d, or mocked. H e must not allow them to us e casuistry in the interpretation of his que stions. It is a common kna ver y, especially in ge omancy, to render an answer which is literally true, and ye t deceives. For instance, one might ask whether some bus iness transaction w ould be profitable, and f ind, a fter getting a n affirmative answer, that it really r eferred to the other party to the affair! 84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" There is, on t he surface, no di fficulty at all in ge tting r eplies. In fact, the process is mechanical; success is therefore assured, ba r a stroke of apopl exy. But, even suppos e we are safe from deceit, how can we know that the que st ion ha s really be en put to another mind, unde rstood r ightly, and a nswered from know ledge? It is obvi ously pos sible to check one 's ope rations by c lairvoya nce, but this is rather like buyi ng a safe to ke ep a brick in. E xperience is the o nly teacher. One acquires what one may almost call a new sense. One feels in one's self whether one is right or not. The diviner must develop this sense. It resembles the exqui site sensibility of touch which is found i n the great bil liard player whose fingers can estimate infinitesimal degrees of force, {161} o r the similar phe nom enon i n the professional taster of tea or wine who c an dist ingui sh fantastically subtle differences of flavour . It is a hard saying; but in the order to divine without error, one ought to be a Master of the Temple. Divination a ffords excellent practice for those who a spire to that exalted eminence, for the faintest breath of personal preference will deflect the needle from the pole of truth in the answer. Unless the divin er have banished utterly from his mind the minutest atom of interest in the ans wer to his que stion, he is almost certain to influence that answer in favour of his personal inclinations. The psycho-analyst will recall the fact that dreams are pha ntasmal represent ations of the unc onscious Will of the sleeper, and that not only are they image s of that Will instead of representations of objective truth, but the image its elf is confused by a thous and c ross-currents set in motion by t he various compl exes and inhibitions of his character. If therefore one consults the oracle, o ne must take sure that one is not consciously or unc onsciously br inging pr essur e to be ar upon i t. It is just as when an Englishman cross-examines a Hindu, t h e ultimate answer will be what the Hindu i magines will best please the inqui rer . The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a perfectly true reply, but insists on i nterpreting it so as to suit one 's desires. The va st majority of people who go t o \"fortunetellers\" have nothing e lse in mind but the wish to obt ain supernatural sanction f or their follies. Apart from Occulti sm altogether, every one know s that when pe ople ask for advice, they onl y want to be told how wise they are. Hardly any one acts on t he most obvi ously common sense couns el if it happens to clash with his previous intentions. Indeed, w ho would take couns el unless he were warned by s ome little whisper in his heart t hat he was about to make a fool of himself, which he is determined to do, a nd o nly wants to be able to blame his best friend, or the oracle, when he is ove rta ken by t he disaster which his own interior mentor foresees? Those who e mbark on di vination w ill be wise to consider the foregoing r emark s very de eply. They will know when they are getting de ep enough by t he fact of the thought beginning to hur t them. It is essential to explore one self to the utmost, to analyse {162} one 's mind unt il one can be pos itive, beyond t he pos s ibility of error, that one is able to de tach one self entirely from the que stion . The oracle is a judge ; it must be beyond br ibery and pr ejudice. It is impossible in pr actice to lay dow n rules for the interpretation of sym bols. Their nature must be investigated by i ntellectual methods such as the Qa balah, but the precise shape of meaning in any one case, and the sphere and ten dency of its application, m ust be acquired by e xperience, that is, but induc tio n, by r ecording a nd c lassifying one 's experiments ove r a long pe riod; and - -- t his is the better part --- by r efining one 's ratiocination to the point where i t becomes instinct or intuition, w hichever one likes to call it. It is proper in cases where the sphere of the que stion is well marked to be g in the divination by i nvoc ations of the forces thereto appropriate. An error o f judgm ent as to the true character of the que stion w ould entail penalties prop ortionate to the extent of that error; and the delusions resulting f rom a divin ation f ortified by i nvoc ation w ould be more serious than if one had not employe d such he avy a rtillery.> There can, how ever, be no obj ection to pr eparing one self by a general pur ifi cation a nd c onsecration de vised with the object of detaching one self from one 's 85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" personality and increasing the sensitiveness of one 's faculties. All divination c omes unde r the general type of the element Air. The peculia r properties of air are in consequence its uniform characteristics. Divination is subtle and intangible. It moves with mysterious ease, expanding, c ontracti ng, f lowing, r espons ive to the slightest stress. It receives and transmits eve ry vibration w ithout retaining a ny. It becomes poisonous when its oxyge n is de filed by pa ssing through hum an lungs . There is a peculiar frame of mind ne cessary to successful divination. The con ditions of the problem are difficult. It is obvi ously ne cessary for the mind o f the diviner to be concentrated absolutely upon hi s que stion. Any intrusive t hought will confuse the oracle as certainly as the reader of a newspaper is con fused {163} w hen he reads a paragraph into which a few lines have strayed from another column. I t is equally ne cessary that the muscles with which he manipul ates the apparatus of divination m ust be entirely independent of any vol ition o f his. He must lend them for the moment to the intelligence whom he is consult ing, t o be guided in their movement to make the necessary mechanical actions wh ich de termine the phys ical factor of the ope ration. I t will be obvi ous that th is is somewhat awkward for the diviner who is also a magician, for as a magicia n he has been constantly at work to ke ep all his forces unde r his own control, and to pr event the slightest interference with them by a ny a lien Will. It is, in fact, commonly the case, or so says the experience of The MASTER THERION, th at the most promising M agicians are the most deplorable diviners, and vi ce vers a. It is only when the aspirant approaches perfection that he becomes able to reconcile these two apparently oppos ing f aculties. Indeed, there is no s urer s ign of all-round s uccess than this ability to put the whole of one 's pow ers at the service of any type of task. With regard to the mind, a gain, it would seem that concentration on t he que s tion m akes more difficult the necessary de tachment from it. Once again, the di viner stands in ne ed of a considerable degree of attainment in the practices of meditation. H e must have succeeded in de stroying the tendency of the ego to i nterfere with the object of thought . He must be able to conceive of a thing ou t of all relation w ith anything e lse. The regular practice of concentration le ads to this result; in fact, it destroys the thing itself as we have hitherto c onceived it; for the nature of things is always veiled from us by our habit of regarding them as in essential relation w ithout our selves and our reactions tow ard them. One can ha rdly expect the diviner to make Samadhi with his que stion - -- that w ould be going too f ar, and de stroy the character of the ope ration by r emoving t he que stion f rom the class of concatenated ideas. It would mean interpreting t he que stion in terms of \"without limit\", and this imply an equally formless ans wer. But he shoul d approximate to this extreme sufficiently to allow the que st ion e ntire freedom to make for itself its own pr oper links with the intelligenc e directing the answer, {164} pr eserving its pos ition on i ts own plane, and e vo king the necessary count erpoise to its own de viation f rom the nor m of nothingne ss. We may recapitulate the above reflections in a practical form. We will supp ose that one wishes to divine by ge omancy whether or no one shoul d marry, it be ing a ssumed that one 's emotional impulses sugge st so rash a course. The man ta kes his wand a nd hi s sand; the traces the que stion, m akes the appropriate penta gram, and the sigil of the spirit. Before tracing the dashes which are to de te rmine the four \"Mothers\", he must strictly examine himself. He must banish fro m his mind e very thought which can pos sibly act as an attachment to his propos e d pa rtner. He must banish all thought s which concern himself, those of apprehe nsion no l ess than those of ardour . He must carry his introspection a s far as possible. He must obs erve with all the subtlety at his command w hether it pain s him to abandon a ny of these thought s. So long a s his mind is stirred, how eve r slightly, by one single aspect of the subject, he is not fit to be gin to form the figure. He must sink hi s personality in that of the intelligence hearing the que stion pr opounde d by a stranger to whom he is indifferent, but whom it is his bus iness to serve faithfully. He must now run ove r the whole affair in hi 86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"s mind, m aking s ure of this utter aloofness therefrom. He must also make sure that his muscles are perfectly free to respond t o the touch of the Will of that intelligence. (It is of course unde rstood t hat he has not become so familiar with ge omancy by di nt of practice as to be able to calculate subconsciously wha t figures he will form; for this would vitiate the experiment entirely. It is, in fact, one of the objections to ge omancy that soone r or later one doe s becom e aware at the time of tracing them whether the dots are going to be even or od d. This needs a special training to correct). Physio-psychological theory will probably maintain that the \"automatic\" acti on of the hand is controlled by t he brain no l ess than in the case of conscious volition; but this is an additional argum ent for identifying the brain with th e intelligence invoke d. Having thus identified himself as closely as pos sible with that intelligence , and c oncentrated on t he que stion a s if the \"prophe sying s pirit\" were giving i ts whole attention thereto, he must {165} a wait the impulse to trace the marks on the sand; and, a s soon a s it comes let it race to the finish. H ere arises a nother technical difficulty. One has to make 16 r ows of dots; and, e specially for the beginner, the mind ha s to gr apple with the apprehension lest the hand f ail to execute the required num ber. It is also troubl ed by f earing to exceed; but excess doe s not matter. Extra lines are simply nul l and voi d, so that the best plan is to ba nish that thought , and m ake sure only of not stoppi ng too s oo n.> The lines being traced, the ope ration is ove r as far as spiritual qua lities are required, for a time. The process of setting up t he figure for judgm ent is pur ely mechanical. But, in the judgm ent, the diviner stands onc e more in ne ed of his inmost and utmost attainments. He shoul d exhaust the intellectual sources of information at his disposal, and f orm from them his judgm ent. But having done this, he sh ould de tach his mind f rom what it has just formulated, and pr oceed to concentra te it on t he figure as a whole, almost as if it were the object of his meditati on. O ne need ha rdly repeat that in bot h these ope rations detachment from one 's personal partialities is as necessary as it was in the first part of the work. In setting up t he figure, bias would be get a Freudian pha ntasm to replace the image of truth which the figure ought to be ; and it is not too m uch to say tha t the entire subconscious machinery of the body a nd m ind lends itself with hor r id willingne ss to this ape-like antic of treason. B ut now that the figure stan ds for judgm ent, the same bias would tend to form its pha ntasm of wish-fulfilme nt in a different manner. It would act through t he mind to be wray sound j udgm e nt. It might, for example, induc e one to emphasize the Venereal element in Pue lla at the expense of the Saturnian. I t might lead one to unde rrate the influe nce of a hos tile figure, or to ne glect altogether some element of importance. The MASTER THERION has know n cases where the diver was so afraid of an unf avour able answer that he made actual mistakes in the simple mechanical construction of the figure! Finally, in the {166} s umming up; it is fatally easy to slur ov er unpl easantness, and to br eathe on t he tiniest spark that promises to kindle the tinder --- the rotten rags! --- of hope . The concluding ope ration is therefore to obt ain a judgm ent of the figure, in dependent of all intellectual or moral restraint. One must endeavour to appreh end it as a thing a bsolute in itself. One must treat it, in short, very much t he same as one did the que stion; as a mystical entity, till now unr elated with other phe nom ena. One must, so to speak, adore it as a god, unc ritically: \"Spea k, L ord, for thy s ervant heareth.\" It must be allowed to impose its intrinsic individuality on t he mind, t o put its fingers independently on w hatever notes i t pleases. In this way one obtains an impression of the true pur port of the answer; and one obtains it armed with a sanction s uperior to any s ensible sugge stions. It comes from and to a part of the individual which is independent of the influen ce of environm ent; is adjusted to that environm ent by t rue necessity, and not b y the artifices of such adaptations as our pur blind c onception of conve nience i nduc es us to fabricate. 87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" The student will obs erve from the above that divination is in one sense an art entirely separate from that of Magick; yet it interpenetrates Magick at eve ry poi nt.

The right use of divina tion ha s already be en explained; but it must be added that proficiency therein, tremendous as is its importance in furnishing the Magician with the informatio n ne cessary to his strategical and tactical plans, in no w ise enables him to a ccomplish the impossible. It is not within the scope of divination to pr edict the future (for example) with the certainty of an astronom er in calculating the return of a comet.> There is always much virtue in divination; for (Shakespea re assures us!) there is \"much virtue in IF\"! In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgm ent, one must allow fo r more than the num erous sources of error inherent {167} i n the process itself. The judgm ent can do no m ore than the facts presented to it warrant. It is na turally impossible in most cases to make sure that some important factor has no t been om itted. I n asking, \" shall I be wise to marry?\" one leaves it ope n for wisdom to be defined in divers ways. One can onl y expect an answer in the sens e of the que stion. The connot ation of \"wise\" would then imply the limitations \"in your private definition of wisdom \", \"in reference to your present circumsta nces.\" It would not invol ve gua rantee against subsequent disaster, or pronounc e a philosophi cal dictum as to wisdom in the abstract sense. One must not assu me that the oracle is omniscient. By the nature of the case, on t he contrary, it is the utterance of a being w hose pow ers are partial and limited, though not to such an extent, or in the same directions, as one 's own. B ut a man who is advised to pur chase a certain stock shoul d not complain if a general panic knoc ks the bottom out of it a few weeks later. The advice only referred to the pro spects of the stock in itself. The divination m ust not be blamed any m ore than one would blame a man for buyi ng a hous e at Ypres there years before the World -War. As against this, one must insist that it is obvi ously to the advantage of the diviner to obt ain this information f rom beings of the most exalted essence avai lable. An old witch who ha s a familiar spirit of merely local celebrity such a s the toad in he r tree, can ha rdly expect him to tell her much more of private matters than he r parish magazine doe s of publ ic. It depends entirely on t he Ma gician how he is served. The greater the man, the greater must be his teacher. It follows that the highest forms of communicating da emons, those who know , s o to speak, the court secrets, disdain to concern themselves with matters which they regard as beneath them. One must not make the mistake of calling in a fa mous phys ician to one 's sick Pekinese. One must also be ware of asking e ven the cleverest angel a que stion out side his ambit. A heart specialist shoul d not p rescribe for throat troubl e. The Magician ought therefore to make himself master of several methods of di vination; using one or the other as the pur pose of the moment dictates. He sho uld make a point of organizing a staff of such spirits to suit various {168} oc casions. These shoul d be \"familiar\"spirits, in the strict sense; members of hi s family. He shoul d de al with them constantly, avoiding w himsical or capriciou s changes. He shoul d choos e them so that their capacities cover the whole grou nd of his work; but he shoul d not multiply them unne cessarily, for he makes him self respons ible for each one that he employs. Such spirits shoul d be ceremoni ally evoke d to visible or semi-visible appearance. A strict arrangement shoul d be made and s worn. This must be kept punc tiliously by t he Magician, and its i nfringement by t he spirit severely puni shed. R elations with these spirits shou ld be confirmed and e ncouraged by f requent intercourse. They shoul d be treated with courtesy, consideration, a nd e ven affection. They shoul d be taught to lo ve and r espect their master, and to take pride in be ing trusted by hi m. It is sometimes better to act on t he advice of a spirit even when one know s it to be wrong, t hough i n such a case one must take the proper precautions agai nst an unde sirable result. The reason f or this is that spirits of this type ar e very sensitive. They suffer agoni es of remorse on r ealising that they ha ve i njured their Master; for he is their God; they know themselves to be part of hi m, their aim is to attain to absorption in him. They unde rstand therefore that 88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":" his interests are theirs. Care must be taken to employ none but spirits who a re fit for the pur pose, not only by r eason of their capacity to suppl y informat ion, but for their sympathy w ith the personality of the Magician. Any a ttempt to coerce unw illing s pirits is dangerous. They obe y from fear; their fear make s them flatter, and tell amiable falsehoods . It also creates pha ntasmal projec tions of themselves to pe rsonate them; and these pha ntasms, besides being w orth less, become the prey of malicious daemons who us e them to attack the Magician in va rious ways whose prospect of success is enhanced by t he fact that he has h imself created a link w ith them. One more obs ervation s eems desirable while on t his subject. Divination of a ny ki nd is improper in matters directly concerning the Great Work itself. In t he Know ledge and C onve rsation of his Holy Guardian Angel, the adept is pos sesse d of all he can pos sibly ne ed. To consult any ot her is to insult one 's {169} A ngel. M oreover, it is to abandon t he only pe rson w ho r eally know s, and r eally cares, in favour of one who by t he nature of the case, must be ignor ant> of the essence of the matter --- one whose interest in it is no m ore (at the best) th an that of a well-meaning s tranger. It shoul d go w ithout saying that until the Magician ha s attained to the Know ledge and C onve rsation of his Holy Guardian A ngel he is liable to endless deceptions. He doe s not know Himself; how can he explain his bus iness to others? How can those others, though t hey do t heir bes t for him, aid in anything but trifles? One must therefore be prepared for dis appoi ntment at every stage until one attains to adeptship. This is especially true of divination, be cause the essence of the hor ror of not know ing one 's Angel is the utter bewilderment and a ngui sh of the mind, c omp licated by t he persecution of the body , and e nvenom ed by t he ache of the soul. One puts the wrong que stions, and put s them wrong; gets the wrong a nswers, jud ges them wrong, a nd a cts wrongl y upon t hem. One must nevertheless persist, asp iring w ith ardour towards one 's Angel, and c omforted {170} by t he assurance tha t He is guiding one secretly towards Himself, and that all one 's mistakes are n ecessary pr eparations for the appoi nted hour of meeting H im. Each mistake is t he combing-out of some tangle in the hair of the bride as she is being c oiffed for marriage. On the other hand, a lthough t he adept is in da ily communication w ith his Ang el, he ought to be careful to consult Him only on que stions proper to the digni ty of the relation. O ne shoul d not consult one 's Angel on t oo m any de tails, or indeed on a ny m atters which come within the office of one 's familiar spirits. One doe s not go t he the King a bout petty pe rsonal trifles. The romance and r a pture of the ineffable union w hich constitutes Adeptship must not be profaned b y the introduc tion of commonpl ace cares. One must not appear with one 's hair i n curl-papers, or complain of the cook's impertinence, if one wants to make the most of the hone ymoon.> To the Adept divination be comes therefore a seconda ry consideration, a lthoug h he can now employ it with absolute confidence, and pr obably us e it with far g reater frequency than be fore his attainment. Indeed, this is likely in pr opor t ion a s he learns that resort to divination ( on e very oc casion w hen his Will doe s not instantly instruct him) with implicit obe dience to its couns els careless as to whether or no t hey may land hi m in disaster, is a means admirably efficac ious of keeping hi s mind unt roubl ed by e xternal impressions, and therefore in t he proper condi tion to receive the reiterant strokes of rapture with which the love of his Angel ravishes him. We have now mapped out the bounda ries of pos sibility and pr opriety which de f ine the phys ical and pol itical geography of divination. The student must gua rd himself constantly against suppos ing that this art affords any a bsolute means of discovering \" truth\", or indeed, of using that word as if it meant more than the {171} r elation of two ideas each of which is itself as subject to \"change w ithout notice\" as a musical programme. Divination, i n the nature of things, can do no m ore than put the mind of the que rent into conscious conne ction w ith another mind w hose know ledge of the sub ject at issue is to his own as that of an expert to a layman. The expert is no 89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"t infallible. The client may put his que stion in a misleading m anner, or even base it on a completely erroneous conception of the facts.

Apart from all thi s, excluding a ll error, bot h que stion a nd a nswer are limited in va lidity by t he ir own condi tions; and these condi tions are such that truth may cease to be tru e, either as time goe s on, or if it be flawed by t he defect of failure to consi der some circumstances whose concealed ope ration c ancels the contract. In a word, di vination, l ike any ot her science, is justified of its children. It would be extraordinary shoul d so fertile a mother be immune from still-bir ths, monstrosities, and a bortions.

Divination is no m ore than a rough a nd r eady pr actical method w hich we unde r stand ha rdly at all, and ope rate only as empirics. Success for the best divine r alive is no m ore certain in any pa rticular instance than a long put t by a cha mpion gol fer. Its calculations {172} a re infinitely more complex than Chess, a Chess played on a n infinite boa rd with men whose moves are indeterminate, and made still more difficult by t he interference of imponde rable forces and unf orm ulated laws; while its conduc t demands not only the virtues, themselves rare en ough, of intellectual and m oral integrity, but intuition c ombining de licacy wit h strength in such pe rfection a nd to such extremes as to make its existence app ear monstrous and m iraculous against Nature. To admit this is not to discredit oracles. On the contrary, the oracles fel l into disrepute just because they pr etended to do m ore than they could. To di vine concerning a matter is little more than to calculate probabilities. We ob tain the use of minds who ha ve access to know ledge beyond our s, but not to om ni science. HRU, the great angel set ove r the Tarot, is beyond us as we are beyon d the ant; but, for all we know , the know ledge of HRU is excelled by s ome might ier mind in the same propor tion. N or have we any w arrant for accusing H RU of i gnor ance or error if we read the Tarot to our own de lusion. H e may ha ve know n, he may ha ve spoke n truly; the fault may lie with our own insight.> The MASTER THERION has obs erved on i nnum erable occasions that divinations, m ade by hi m and di smissed as giving unt rue answers, have justified themselves mo nths or years later when he was able to revise his judgm ent in pe rspective, unt roubl ed by hi s personal passion. It is indeed surprising how often the most careless divinations give accurat e answers. When things go w rong, i t is almost always pos sible to trace the err or to one 's own self-willed and insolent presumption in insisting that events s hall accommodate themselves to our egoism and va nity. It is comically uns cient ific to adduc e {173} e xamples of the mistakes of the diviners as evidence that their art is fatuous . Every one know s that the simplest chemical experiments o ften go w rong. E very one know s the eccentricities of fount ain pe ns; but nobody outside Evangelical circles makes fun of the Cavendish experiment, or asserts that, if fount ain pe ns undoubt edly work now and then, their doing s o is merely coincidence. The fact of the case is that the laws of nature are incomparably more subtle than even science suspects. The phe nom ena of every plane are intimately inter woven. The argum ents of Aristotle were dependent on t he atmospheric pressure w hich pr evented his blood f rom boiling a way.

To-day it seems equally irrational to enqui re of the desert sand concerning the fate of empires. Yet surely it, if any one know s, shoul d know ! To-day it may sound i mpossible for inanimate objects to reveal the inmost se crets of mankind a nd na ture. We cannot say why di vination is valid.

The Wheel turns to those effectual methods of invoc ation e mployed in the an cient Mysteries and by c ertain secret bodi es of initiates to-day. The object o f them is almost invariably> the invoc ation of a God, t hat God c onceived in a m 91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"ore or less material and pe rsonal fashion. These Rituals are therefore well su ited for such pe rsons as are capable of unde rstanding the spirit of Magick as o ppos ed to the letter. One of the great advantages of them is that a large num b er of persons may take part, so that there is consequently more force available ; but it is important that they shoul d all be initiates of the same mysteries, bound by t he same oaths, and f illed with the same aspirations. They shoul d be associated onl y for this one pur pose. Such a company be ing pr epared, the story of the God s houl d be dramatised by a well-skilled poe t accustomed to this form of composition. L engthy s peeches a nd invoc ations shoul d be avoided, but action s houl d be very full. Such ceremon ies shoul d be carefully rehearsed; but in rehearsals care shoul d be taken to om it the climax, w hich shoul d be studied by t he principal character in pr ivate. The play shoul d be so arranged that this climax de pends on hi m alone. By this means one prevents the ceremony f rom becoming m echanical or hackneyed, and the element of surprise. {177} a ssists the lesser characters to ge t out of themselv es at the supreme moment. Following the climax there shoul d always be an unr eh earsed ceremony, an impromptu. The most satisfactory form of this is the dance . In such ceremonies appropriate libations may be freely us ed. The Rite of Luna (Equinox I . VI) is a good e xample of this use. Here the cl imax is the music of the godde ss, the assistants remaining in silent ecstasy. In the rite of Jupiter the impromptu is the dance, in that of Saturn long pe riods of silence. It will be noticed that in these Rites poe try and m usic were largely employe d --- mostly publ ished pieces by w ell-know n authors and c omposers. It would be better> to write and c ompose specially for the ceremony> .  - -------- {178}  C HAPTER XX  O F THE EUCHARIST AND OF THE ART OF ALCHEMY  I One of the simplest and m ost complete of Magick ceremonies is the Eucharist. It consists in taking c ommon things, transmuting them into things divine, an d consuming them. So far, it is a type of every magick ceremony, for the reabsorption of the f orce is a kind of consumption; but it has a more restricted application, a s fol lows. Take a substance> symbolic of the whole course of nature, make it God, a nd c onsume it. There are many w ays of doing this; but they may easily be classified accordi ng to the num ber of the elements of which the sacrament is composed. The highest form of the Eucharist is that in which the Element consecrated i s One. It is one substance and not two, not living a nd not dead, ne ither liquid nor solid, ne ither hot nor cold, ne ither male nor female. This sacrament is secret in every respect. For those who m ay be worthy, alt 92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"hough not officially recogni zed as such, this Eucharist has been de scribed in d etail and w ithout concealment, \"somewhere\" in the publ ished writings of the MAS TER THERION. But He has told no one where. It is reserved for the highest ini tiates, and is synonym ous with the Accomplished Work on t he {179} m aterial plan e. It is the Medicine of Metals, the Stone of the Wise, the Potable Gold, the Elixir of Life that is consumed therein. The altar is the bos om of Isis, the e ternal mother; the chalice is in effect the Cup of our Lady B abalon H erself; th e Wand is that which Was and I s and I s To Come. The Eucharist of \"two\" elements has its matter of the passives. The wafer ( pantacle) is of corn, typical of earth; the wine (cup) represents water. (Ther e are certain other attributions. The Wafer is the Sun, f or instance: and the wine is appropriate to Bacchus). The wafer may, how ever, be more complex, the \"Cake of Light\" described in Li ber Legis. This is used in the exoteric Mass of the Phoenix (Liber 333, C ap: 44) mixed with the blood of the Magus. This mass shoul d be performed da ily at sunset by every magician. Corn and w ine are equivalent to flesh and bl ood; but it is easier to conve rt live substances into the body a nd bl ood of God, t han to pe rform this miracle u pon de ad matter. The Eucharist of \"three\" elements has for basis the symbols of the three Gun as. For Tamas (darkness) take opium or nightshade or some sleepy m edicine; for Rajas (activity) take strychnine or other excitant; for Sattvas (calm) the cak es of Light may again be suitable.> The Eucharist of \"four\" elements consists of fire, air, water, and e arth. T hese are represented by a flame for fire, by i ncense or roses for air, by w ine for water, and by br ead and s alt for earth. The Eucharist of \"five\" has for basis wine for taste, a rose for smell, a fl ame for sight, a bell for sound, a nd a dagger for touch. This sacrament is imp lied in the Mass of the Phoenix in a slightly different form. {180} The Eucharist of \"six\" elements has Father, Son, a nd H oly Spirit above ; brea th, w ater, and bl ood be neath. I t is a sacrament reserved for high initiates.> The Eucharist of \"seven\" elements is mystically identical with that of one . Of the method of consecrating the elements it is only ne cessary to say that they shoul d be treated as talismans. The circle and ot her furniture of the Tem ple shoul d receive the usual benefit of the banishings and c onsecrations. The Oath shoul d be taken and the Invoc ations made. When the divine force manifests in the elements, they shoul d be solemnly consumed. There is also a simpler me thod of consecration r eserved for initiates of high r ank, of which it is here u nlawful to speak. According to the nature of the Sacrament, so will its results be. In some one may receive a mystic grace, culminating in Samadhi; in others a simpler and m o re material benefit may be obtained. The highest sacrament, that of One element, is universal in its ope ration; a ccording to the declared pur pose of the work so will the result be. It is a un iversal Key of all Magick. These secrets are of supreme practical importance, and a re gua rded in the Sa nctuary with a two-edged sword flaming e very way>; for this sacrament is the Tr ee of Life itself, and w hoso pa rtaketh of the fruit thereof shall never die>. Unless he so will. Who w ould not rather work through i ncarnation; a real rene wal of body a nd br ain, than content himself with a stagnant immortality upon t h is mote in the Sunlight of the Universe which we call earth? {181} With regard to the preparations for such Sacraments, the Catholic Church ha s m aintained well enough t he traditions of the true Gnostic Church in whose keepin g the secrets are.> Chastity> is a condi tion; fasting f or some hour s previous is a condi tion; an earnest and c ontinual aspiration is a condi tion. Without these antecedents ev en the Eucharist of the One and S even is partially --- though s uch is its intri nsic virtue that it can ne ver be wholly --- baulked of its effect. A Eucharist of some sort shoul d most assuredly be consummated da ily by e very m 93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"agician, and he shoul d regard it as the main sustenance of his magical life. I t is of more importance than any ot her magical ceremony, because it is a comple te circle. The whole of the force expended is completely re-absorbed; yet the virtue is that vast gain represented by t he abyss between M an and G od. The magician be comes filled with God, f ed upon G od, i ntoxicated with God. L ittle by l ittle his body w ill become pur ified by t he internal lustration of God ; day by da y his mortal frame, shedding its earthly elements, will become in ve ry truth the Temple of the Holy Ghost. Day by da y matter is replaced by S pirit , the hum an by t he divine; ultimately the change will be complete; God m anifest in flesh will be his name. This is the most important of all magical secrets that ever were or are or c an be . To a Magician thus renewed the attainment of the Know ledge and C onve rsa tion of the Holy Guardian Angel becomes an inevitable task; every force of his nature, unhi ndered, tends to that aim and goa l of whose nature neither man nor god m ay speak, for that it is infinitely be yond s peech or thought or {182} e cst asy or silence. Samadhi and N ibbana are but its shadow s cast upon t he universe .  I I If the Master Therion e ffects by t his book not hing e lse but to de monstrate t he continuity of nature and the uniformity of Law, He will feel that His work h as not been wasted. I n his original design of Part III he did not contemplate any a llusion to alchemy. It has somehow been taken for granted that this subje ct is entirely foreign to regular Magick, bot h in scope and m ethod. I t will be the main obj ect of the following de scription to establish it as essentially a branch of the subject, and to show that it may be considered simply as a partic ular case of the general propos ition - -- differing f rom evocatory and talismani c Magick onl y in the values which are represented by t he unknow n qua ntities in the pantomorphous equations. There is no ne ed to make any s ystematized attempt to de cipher the jargon of Hermetic treatises. We need not enter upon a n historical discussion. L et it s uffice to say that the word alchemy is an Arabic term consisting of the article \"al\" and the adjective \"khemi\" which means \"that which pe rtains to Egypt \">. A rough t ranslation w ould be \"The Egypt ian matter\". The assumption is that the Mohammedan gr ammarians held traditionally that the art was derived from that wi sdom of the Egypt ians which was the boa st of Moses, Plato, and P ythagoras, and the source of their illumination. M odern research (by pr ofane scholars) leaves it still doubt ful as to whether Alchemical treatises shoul d be classified as mystical, magical, medical, or ch emical. The most reasonable opinion is that all these objects formed the pre-o ccupation of the alchemists in va rying pr opor tions. Hermes is alike the god of Wisdom , Thaumaturgy, therapeutics, and phys ical science. All these may conseq uently claim the title Hermetic. It cannot be doubt ed that such writers as Flu dd a spired to spiritual perfection. I t is equally sure that Edward Kelly wrote primarily from the point of view {183} of a Magician; that Paracelesus applied himself to the cure of disease and the prolonga tion of life as the first consi deration, a lthough hi s greatest achievements seem to modern thinkers to ha ve be en rather his discoveries of opium, zinc, and hydr ogen; so that we tend to thin k of him as a chemist no l ess than we do of Van Helmont, whose conception of ga s ranks him as one of those rare geniuses who ha ve increased hum an know ledge by a funda mentally important idea. The literature of Alchemy is immense. Practically all of it is wholly or pa rtially uni ntelligible. Its treatises, from the \"Asch M etzareph\" of the Hebrew s to the \"Chariot of Antimony\" are deliberately couched in hieratic riddles. E cclesiastical persecution, a nd the profanation of the secrets of pow er, were eq ually dr eaded. Worse still, from our point of view, this motive induc ed writer s to insert intentionally misleading s tatements, the more deeply to be devil unw orthy pr etenders to their mysteries. We do not propos e to discuss any of the actual processes. M ost readers will 94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":" be already a ware that the main obj ects of alchemy were the Philosophe r's Stone , the Medicine of Metals, and va rious tinctures and e lixirs pos sessing di vers v irtues; in pa rticular, those of healing di sease, extending the span of life, in creasing hum an abilities, perfecting the nature of man in every respect, confer ring m agical pow ers, and transmuting m aterial substances, especially metals, in to more valuable forms. The subject is further complicated by t he fact that many a uthors were uns cru pulous qua cks. Ignor ant of the first elements of the art, they plagiarized wit hout shame, and r eaped a harvest of fraudul ent gain. They took a dvantage of th e general ignor ance, and the conve ntion of mystery, in just the same way as the ir modern successors do i n the matter of all Occult sciences. But despite all this, one thing is abunda ntly clear; all serious writers, th ough t hey seem to speak of an infinity of different subjects, so much so that i t has proved impossible for modern analytic research to ascertain the true natu re of any s ingle process, were agreed on t he funda mental theory on w hich they b ased their practices. It appears at first sight as if hardly any two of them w ere in accord as to the nature of the \"First Matter of the work\". {184} They d escribe this in a bewildering m ultiplicity of unintelligible symbols. We have no r eason to suppos e that they were all talking of the same thing, or otherwise . The same remarks apply to every reagent and e very pr ocess, no l ess than to t he final produc t or produc ts. Yet beneath this diversity, we may pe rceive an obs cure identity. They all b egin with a substance in na ture which is described as existing a lmost everywher e, and a s universally esteemed of no va lue. The alchemist is in all cases to t ake this substance, and s ubject it to a series of ope rations. By so doi ng, he obtains his produc t. This produc t, how ever named or described, is always a sub stance which represents the truth or perfection of the original \"First Matter\"; and its qua lities are invariably such as pertain to a living be ing, not to an inanimate mass. In a word, the alchemist is to take a dead thing, i mpure, valu eless, and pow erless, and transform it into a live thing, a ctive, invaluable an d thaumaturgic. The reader of this book w ill surely find in this a most striking a nalogy w it h what we have already s aid of the processes of Magick. What, by our definitio n, is initiation? The First Matter is a man, that is to say, a perishable para site, bred of the earth's crust, crawling irritably upon i t for a span, and a t last returning to the dirt whence he sprang. The process of initiation c onsist s in removing hi s impurities, and f inding in his true self an immortal intellig ence to whom matter is no m ore than the means of manifestation. The initiate i s eternally individual; he is ineffable, incorruptible, immune from everything. He pos sesses infinite wisdom and infinite pow er in himself. This equation is identical with that of a talisman. The Magician takes an idea, pur ifies it, i ntensifies it by i nvoki ng into it the inspiration of his soul. It is no l onge r a scrawl scratched on a sheep-skin, but a word of Truth, imperishable, mighty to pr evail throughout the sphere of its pur port. The evocation of a spirit is precisely similar in essence. The exorcist takes dead material substances of a nature sympathetic to the being w hom he intends to invoke . He banishes all im purities therefrom, prevents all interference therewith, and pr oceeds to give l ife to the subtle substance thus prepared by i nstilling hi s soul. {185} Once again, there is nothing in this exclusively \"magical\". Rembrandt van R yn us ed to take a num ber of ores and ot her crude objects. From these he banish ed the impurities, and c onsecrated them to his work, by t he preparation of canv asses, brushes, and c olours. This done , he compelled them to take the stamp of his soul; from those dull, valueless creatures of earth he created a vital and pow erful being of truth and be auty. It would indeed be surprising to anybody who ha s come to a clear comprehension of nature if there were any di fference in the essence of these various formulas. The laws of nature apply equally in ev ery pos sible circumstance. We are now in a pos ition to unde rstand w hat alchemy is. We might even go f u rther and s ay that even if we had ne ver heard of it, we know what it must be. Let us emphasize the fact that the final produc t is in all cases a living th 95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"ing. I t has been the great stumbling bl ock to modern research that the stateme nts of alchemists cannot be explained away. From the chemical standpoi nt it ha s seemed not \"a priori\" impossible that lead shoul d be turned into gol d. O ur r ecent discovery of the periodicity of the elements has made it seem likely, at least in theory, that our apparently immutable elements shoul d be modifications of a single one .> Organic Chemistry, with its metatheses and s yntheses depend ent on t he conceptions of molecules as geometrical structures has demonstrated a praxis which gives this theory body; and the properties of Radium have driven the Old Guard from the redoubt which flew the flag of the essential heterogene ity of the elements. The doc trines of Evolution ha ve brought the alchemical an d monistic theory of matter into line with our conception of life; the collapse of the wall between the animal and ve getable kingdom s has shaken that which di vided them from the mineral. But even though t he advanced chemist might admit the pos sibility of transmut ing lead into gol d, he could not conceive of that {186} gol d as other than meta llic, of the same order of nature as the lead from which it had be en made. Tha t this gold shoul d pos sess the pow er of multiplying itself, or of acting a s a f erment upon ot her substances, seemed so absurd that he felt obliged to conclude that the alchemists who c laimed these properties for their Gold must, after al l, have been referring not to Chemistry, but to some spiritual ope rations whose sanctity de manded some such symbolic veil as the cryptographic use of the lang uage of the laboratory. The MASTER THERION is sangui ne that his present reduction of all cases of th e art of Magick to a single formula will both elucidate and vi ndicate Alchemy, while extending c hemistry to cover all classes of Change. There is an obvi ous condi tion w hich limits our propos ed ope rations. This is that, as the formula of any Work effects the extraction a nd vi sualization of t he Truth from any \" First Matter\", the \"Stone\" or \"Elixir\" which results from ou r labour s will be the pur e and pe rfect Individual originally inherent in the su bstance chosen, and not hing e lse. The most skilful gardener cannot produc e lil ies from the wild rose; his roses will always be roses, how ever he have perfect ed the properties of this stock. There is here no c ontradiction w ith our previous thesis of the ultimate unit y of all substance. It is true that Hobbs and N obbs are both modifications of the Pleroma. Both va nish in the Pleroma when they attain Samadhi. But they ar e not interchangeable to the extent that they are individual modifications; the initiate Hobbs is not the initiate Nobbs any m ore than Hobbs the haberdasher i s Nobbs of \"the nail an sarspan bus iness as he got his money by\" . Our skill in produc ing a niline dye s doe s not enable us to dispense with the original anilin e, and us e sugar instead. Thus the Alchemists said: \"To make gold you m ust tak e gold\"; their art was to br ing e ach substance to the perfection of its own pr o per nature. No doubt , part of this process invol ved the withdrawal of the essence of the \"First Matter\" within the hom ogeneity of \"Hyle\", just as initiation insists on the annihilation of the individual in the Impersonal Infinity of Existence to emerge onc e more as a less confused and de formed Eidolon of the Truth of Himsel f. This is the gua rantee that he is unc ontaminated by a lien elements. The {18 7} \" Elixir\" must pos sess the activity of a \"nascent\" substance, just as \"nascen t\" hydr ogen combines with arsenic (in \"Marsh's test\") when the ordinary form of the gas is inert. Again, oxyge n satisfied by s odium or diluted by ni trogen wi ll not attack combustible materials with the vehemence proper to the pur e gas. We may summarize this thesis by s aying that Alchemy includes as many pos sibl e ope rations as there are original ideas inherent in na ture. Alchemy resembles evocation in its selection of appropriate material bases f or the manifestation of the Will; but differs from it in pr oceeding w ithout per sonification, or the intervention of alien planes.> It may be more closely com pared with Initiation; for the effective element of the Produc t is of the essen ce of its own na ture, and inherent therein; the Work similarly consists in isol ating it from its accretions. Now just as the Aspirant, on t he Threshold of Initiation, f inds himself assa 96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"iled by t he \"complexes\" which ha ve corrupted him, their externalization e xcruci ating hi m, and hi s agoni zed reluctance to their elimination pl ungi ng hi m into s uch or deals that he seems (both to himself and to others) to ha ve turned from a nobl e and upr ight man into an unut terable scoundr el; so doe s the \"First Matter \" blacken and put refy as the Alchemist breaks up i ts coagulations of impurity. The student may work out for himself the various analogies invol ved, and di s cover the \"Black Dragon\" , the \"Green Lion\", the \"Lunar Water\", the \"Raven's Hea d\", and s o forth. The indications above given shoul d suffice all who pos sess a ptitude for Alchemical Research. Only one further reflection a ppears necessary; namely, that the Eucharist, w ith which this chapter is properly pr eoccupied, m ust be conceived as one case - -- as the critical case --- of the Art of the Alchemist. The reader will have obs erved, pe rhaps with surprise, that The MASTER THERIO N describes several types of Eucharist. The reason is that given above ; there is no s ubstance incompetent to {188} s erve as an element in some Sacrament; als o, each spiritual Grace shoul d pos sess its peculiar form of Mass, and therefore its own \"materia magica\". It is utterly uns cientific to treat \"God\" as a univ ersal hom ogeneity, and us e the same means to pr olong l ife as to be witch cattle. One doe s not invoke \"Electricity\" indiscriminately to light one 's hous e and t o pr opel one 's brougha m; one works by m easured application of one 's pow ers to i ntelligent analytical comprehension of the condi tions of each separate case. There is a Eucharist for every Grace that we may ne ed; we must apprehend the essential characters in each case, select suitable elements, and de vise proper processes. To consider the classical problems of Alchemy: The Medicine of Metals must be the quintessence of some substance that serves to de termine the structure (o r rate of vibration) whose manifestation is in characteristic metallic qua litie s. This need not be a chemical substance at all in the ordinary sense of the w ord. The Elixir of Life will similarly consist of a living or ganism capable of gr owth, at the expense of its environm ent; and of such a nature that its \"true Wi ll\" is to cause that environm ent to serve it as its means of expression in the phys ical world of hum an life. The Universal Medicine will be a menstruum of such subtlety as to be able to penetrate all matter and transmute it in the sense of its own tendency, while of such impartial pur ity as to accept perfectly the impression of the Will of t he Alchemist. This substance, properly pr epared, and pr operly charged, is able to pe rform all things soever that are phys ically pos sible, within the limits o f the propor tions of its momentum to the inertia of the object to which it is a pplied. It may be obs erved in conclusion that, in de aling w ith forms of Matter-Motio n so subtle as these, it is not enough t o pa ss the Pons Asinorum of intellectua l know ledge. The MASTER THERION has pos sessed the theory of these Powers for many ye ars; but His practice is still in pr ogress towards perfection. E ven efficiency in t he preparation is not all; there is need to be judicious in the manipulation, a nd a droit in the administration, of the produc t. He doe s not perform haphazard miracles, but applies His science and s kill in conformity with the laws of nat ure. {189}  C HAPTER XXI 97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" O F BLACK MAGIC O F THE MAIN TYPES OF THE OPERATIONS OF MAGICK ART AND OF THE POWERS OF THE SPHINX  I As was said at the ope ning of the second c hapter, the Single Supreme Ritual is the attainment of the Know ledge and C onve rsation of the Holy Guardian Angel. \"It is the raising of the complete man in a vertical straight line.\" Any de viation f rom this line tends to be come black magic. Any ot her ope rati on is black magic. In the True Operation the Exaltation is equilibrated by a n expansion in the other three arms of the Cross. Hence the Angel immediately gives the Adept pow er ove r the Four Great Princes and their servitors.> If the magician ne eds to pe rform any ot her ope ration than this, it is only law ful in so far as it is a necessary pr eliminary to That One Work. There are, how ever many s hades of grey. It is not every magician who is well armed with theory. Perhaps one such may invoke Jupiter, with the wish to he al others of their phys ical ills. This sort of thing is harmless,> or almost so. It is not evil in {190} i tself. It arises from a defect of unde rstanding. U n til the Great Work ha s been pe rformed, it is presumptuous for the magician to p retend to unde rstand the universe, and di ctate its policy. Only the Master of the Temple can say whether any gi ven act is a crime. \"Slay that innoc ent child? \" (I hear the ignor ant say) \"What a hor ror!\" \"Ah!\" replies the Know er, with f oresight of history, \"but that child will become Nero. H asten to strangle him! \" There is a third, above these, who unde rstands that Nero was as necessary as Julius Caesar. The Master of the Temple accordingly interferes not with the scheme of thing s except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to do. Why s houl d he struggl e against imprisonm ent, banishment, death? It is all part of the g ame in which he is a pawn. \" It was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer thes e things, and to enter into His glory.\" The Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests that al l these matters are of no i mportance to Him. It may be of importance to His Wo rk that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged. I n such a case He informs h is Magus, who e xerts the pow er intrusted to HIm, and it happens accordingly. Y et all happens naturally, and of necessity, and to all appearance without a wor d from Him. Nor will the mere Master of the Temple, as a rule, presume to act upon t he U niverse, save as the servant of his own de stiny. It is only the Magus, He of t he grade above , who ha s attained to Chokhm ah, Wisdom , and s o da re act. He must dare act, although i t like Him not. But He must assume the Curse of His grade , as it is written in the Book of the Magus.> There are, of course, entirely black forms of magic. To him who ha s not giv en every dr op of his blood f or the cup of BABALON {191} a ll magic pow er is dang erous. There are even more debased and e vil forms, things in themselves black. Such is the use of spiritual force to material ends. Christian Scientists, M ental Healers, Professional Diviners, Psychics and the like, are all \"ipso fact o\" Black M agicians. They exchange gold for dross. They sell their higher pow ers for gross and t emporary be nefit. That the most crass ignor ance of Magick is their principal characteristic is no e xcuse, even if Nature accepted excuses, which she doe s not. If you dr ink poison in mistake for wine, your \"mistake\" will not save your life. Below these in one sense, yet far above them in another, are the Brothers of the Left Hand P ath>. These are they who \" shut themselves up\" , who r efuse thei r blood t o the Cup, w ho ha ve trampled Love in the Race for self-aggrandisment. As far as the grade of Exempt Adept, they are on t he same path as the White Brotherhood; for until that grade is attained, the goa l is not disclosed. Then 98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":" only are the goa ts, the lonely leaping m ount ain-masters, separated from the gr egarious huddl ing va lley-bound s heep.

I I Before leaving the subject of Black M agic, one may touch lightly on t he que s tion of Pacts with the Devil. The Devil doe s not exist. It is a false name invented by t he Black Brothers to imply a Unity in their ignor ant muddl e of dispersions. A devil who ha d uni ty would be a God> . It was said by t he Sorcerer of the Jura that in or der to invoke the Devil it is only ne cessary to call him with your whole will. This is an uni versal magical truth, and a pplies to every other being a s much as to the Devil. For the whole will of every man is in reality the whole will of the Universe. It is, how ever, always easy to call up t he demons, for they are always calli ng you; and you ha ve only to step dow n to their level {193} a nd f raternize with them. They will tear you i n pieces at their leisure. Not at onc e; they will wait until you ha ve wholly br oken the link be tween you a nd your Holy Guardian A ngel before they pounc e, lest at the last moment you e scape. Anthony of Padua and ( in our own times) \"Macgregor\" Mathers are examples of such victims. Nevertheless, every magician must firmly extend hi s empire to the depth of hel l. \"My adepts stand upr ight, their heads above the heavens, their feet below t he hells.\"> This is the reason w hy the magician who pe rforms the Operation of the \"Sacre d M agic of Abramelin the Mage\", immediately after attaining to the Know ledge an d Conve rsation of the Holy Guardian Angel, must evoke the Four Great Princes of the Evil of the World. \"Obedience and f aith to Him that liveth and triumpheth, that reigneth above you i n your palaces as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth\" is your duty to your Holy Guardian Angel, and the duty of the demon w orld to you. These pow ers of \"evil\" nature are wild be asts; they must be tamed, trained t o the saddle and the bridle; they will bear you w ell. There is nothing us eless in the Universe: do not wrap up your Talent in a napkin, be cause it is only \"d irty money\"! With regard to Pacts, they are rarely lawful. There shoul d be no ba rgain st ruck. M agick is not a trade, and no huc ksters need apply. M aster everything, but give generously to your servants, onc e they ha ve unc ondi tionally subm itted. There is also the que stions of alliances with va rious Powers. These again a re hardly ever allowable.> No Power which is not {194} a microcosm in itself - -- and e ven archangels reach rarely to this centre of balance --- is fit to tre at on a n equality with M an. The proper study of mankind is God; with Him is hi s bus iness; and w ith Him alone. Some magicians have hired legions of spirits f or some special pur pose; but it has always proved a serious mistake. The whole idea of exchange is foreign to magick. The dignity of the magician forbids co mpacts. \"The Earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof\". 99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"  I II The ope rations of Magick art are difficult to classify, as they merge into eac h other, ow ing to the essential unity of their method a nd r esult.

It is justifiable in some exceptional cases.

O f what use is such an ope ration, s a ve to gr atify curiosity or vanity? One must add a word on s piritism, which is a sort of indiscriminate necromancy --- one might prefer the word ne crophi lia --- by a mateurs.

No spiritualistic manifestation ha s ever taken place in the {198} pr esence e ven of FRATER PERDURABO; how much less in that of The MASTER THERION!> Of all the creatures He ever met, the most prominent of English spiritists ( a journalist and pa cifist of more than European fame) had the filthiest mind a n d the foulest mouth. H e would br eak of f any c onve rsation to tell a stupid smut ty story, and c ould ha rdly conceive of any s ociety assembling f or any ot her pur pose than \"phallic orgies\", whatever they may be .

This was the plain result of his spiritism. All spiritists are more or less similarly afflicted. They feel dirty even across the street; their auras are ragged, m uddy a nd m alodor ous; they ooz e the slime of putrefying c orpses. No spiritist, onc e he is wholly enmeshed in sentimentality and F reudian fear -phantasms, is capable of concentrated thought , of persistent will, or of moral character. Devoid of every spark of the divine light which was his birthright , a prey be fore death to the gha stly tenants of the grave, the wretch, like the mesmerized and living c orpse of Poe's Monsieur Valdemar, is a \"nearly liquid m ass of loathsome, of detestable putrescence.\" The student of this Holy M agick is most earnestly warned against frequenting their seances, or even admitting them to his presence. They are contagious as Syphi lis, and m ore deadly and di sgusting.

But there is one general principle which seems worthy of special emphasis in this place. These four pow ers are thus complex be cause they are the pow ers of the Sphinx, t hat is, they are functions of a single organism. Now those who unde rstand the growth of organisms are aware that evolution de 101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"pends on a daptation to environm ent. If an animal which cannot swim is occasion ally thrown into water, it may escape by s ome piece of good f ortune, but if it is thrown into water continuous ly it will drown soone r or later, unl ess it lear ns to swim. Organisms being to a certain extent elastic, they soon a dapt themselves to a new environm ent, provided that the change is not so sudde n as to de stroy that elasticity. Now a change in environm ent invol ves a repeated meeting of new condi tions, and if you w ant to adapt your self to any gi ven set of condi tions, the best thing y ou c an do i s to place your self cautiously and pe rsistently among t hem. That is the founda tion of all education. The old-fashioned pe dagogue s were not all so stupid as some modern educators would ha ve us think. The principle of the system was to strike the brain a se ries of constantly repeated blows until the proper reaction be came nor mal to th e organism. It is not desirable to us e ideas which excite interest, or may come {200} i n handy l ater as weapons , in this funda mental training of the mind. I t is much better to compel the mind to bus y itself with root ideas which do not mean ve ry much to the child, be cause you a re not trying to excite the brain, but to dr il l it. For this reason, a ll the best minds have been trained by pr eliminary stu dy of classics and m athematics. The same principle applies to the training of the body . The original exerci ses shoul d be of a character to train the muscles generally to pe rform any ki nd of work, rather than to train them for some special kind of work, concentratio n of which will unf it them for other tasks by de priving them of the elasticity which is the proper condi tion of life.> In M agick and m editation this principle applies with tremendous force. It i s quite useless to teach pe ople how to pe rform magical ope rations, when it may be that such ope rations, when they ha ve learned to do t hem, are not in accordan ce with their wills. What must be done is to dr ill the Aspirant in the hard ro utine of the elements of the Royal Art. So far as mysticism is concerned, the technique is extremely simple, and ha s been ve ry simply de scribed in Part I of this Book 4. I t cannot be said too s t rongl y that any a mount of mystical success whatever is no c ompensation f or slac kness with regard to the technique. There may come a time when Samadhi itself is no pa rt of the bus iness of the mystic. But the character developed by t he o riginal training r emains an asset. In other words, the person w ho ha s made him self a first-class brain capable of elasticity is competent to {201} a ttack any problem soever, when he who ha s merely specialized ha s got into a groove , and can no l onge r adapt and a djust himself to ne w condi tions. The principle is quite universal. You do not train a violinist to play the Beethove n Concerto; you t rain him to play every conceivable consecution of note s with pe rfect ease, and you ke ep him at the most monot onous drill pos sible for years and ye ars before you a llow him to go on t he platform. You m ake of him a n instrument perfectly able to adjust itself to any m usical problem that may be set before him. This technique of Yoga is the most important detail of all ou r work. The MASTER THERION has been himself somewhat to blame in representing this technique as of value simply be cause it leads to the great rewards, such a s Samadhi. He would ha ve been wiser to ba se His teaching s olely on t he ground of evolution. B ut probably He thought of the words of the poe t: \" You da ngle a carrot in front of her nos e, And s he goe s wherever the carrot goe s.\" For, after all, one cannot explain the necessity of the study of Latin either t o imbecile children or to stupid educationalists; for, not having learned Latin , they ha ve not developed the brains to learn anything. The Hindus , unde rstanding these difficulties, have taken the God-Almighty at titude about the matter. If you go t o a Hindu t eacher, he treats you a s less t han an earthworm. You ha ve to do t his, and you ha ve to do t hat, and you a re no t allowed to know why you a re doing it.> After years of experience in teaching, The MASTER THERION is not altogether 102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"convi nced that this is not the right attitude. {202} When pe ople begin to argu e about things instead of doing them, they be come absolutely impossible. Their minds begin to work about it and a bout , and they come out by t he same door as in they went. They remain br utish, vol uble, and unc omprehending. The technique of Magick is just as important as that of mysticism, but here we have a very much more difficult problem, because the original unit of Magick , the Body of Light, is already s omething unf amiliar to the ordinary pe rson. N evertheless, this body m ust be developed and trained with exactly the same rigi d discipline as the brain in the case of mysticism. The essence of the techniq ue of Magick is the developm ent of the body of Light, which must be extended to include all members of the organism, and indeed of the cosmos. The most important drill practices are: 1. The fortification of the Body of Light by t he constant use of rituals, b y the assumption of god- forms, and by t he right use of the Eucharist. 2. The pur ification a nd c onsecration a nd e xaltation of that Body by t he use of rituals of invoc ation. 3. The education of that Body by e xperience. It must learn to travel on e v ery plane; to br eak dow n every obs tacle which may confront it. This experience must be as systematic and r egular as pos sible; for it is of no us e merely to t ravel to the spheres of Jupiter and Venus, or even to explore the 30 Aethyrs, n eglecting una ttractive meridians.> {203} The object is to pos sess a Body w hich is capable of doing e asily any pa rticu lar task that may lie before it. There must be no s election of special experie nce which appeals to one 's immediate desire. One must go s teadily through a ll possible pylons. FRATER PERDRABO was very unf ortunate in not having m agical teachers to expla in these things to Him. He was rather encouraged in uns ystematic working. Ver y fortunate, on t he other hand, w as He to ha ve found a Guru who instructed Him in the proper principles of the technique of Yoga, and H e, having s ufficient se nse to recogni ze the universal application of those principles, was able to som e extent to repair His original defects. But even to this day, despite the fac t that His original inclination is much stronge r towards Magick than towards my sticism, he is much less competent in M agick.> A trace of this can be seen eve n in His method of combining the two divisions of our science, for in that meth od H e makes concentration be ar the Cross of the work. This is pos sibly an error, probably a defect, certainly an impurity of thoug ht, and the root of it is to be found i n His original bad discipline with regar d to M agick. If the reader will turn to the account of his astral journeys in the Second Number of the First Volume of the Equinox, he will find that these experiments were quite capricious. Even when, in M exico, H e got the idea of exploring the 30 Aethyrs systematically, He abandone d the vision a fter only 2 Aethyrs had be e n investigated. {204} Very different is His record after the training in 1901 e .v. had put Him in the way of discipline.> At the conclusion of this part of this book, one may sum up t he whole matter in these words: There is no obj ect whatever worthy of attainment but the regul ar developm ent of the being of the Aspirant by s teady s cientific work; he shoul d not attempt to run be fore he can walk; he shoul d not wish to go s omewhere unt il he know s for certain whither he wills to go.  - -------- {205} 103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"  APPENDIX I.

The general object of this course, besides that already s tated, is to assure sound e ducation in oc cult matters, so that when spiritual illumination c omes i t may find a well-built temple. Where the mind is strongl y biased towards any special theory, the result of an illumination is often to inflame that por tion of the mind w hich is thus ove rdeveloped, w ith the result that the aspirant, ins tead of becoming a n Adept, becomes a bigot and f anatic. {21 1} The A.'.

It shoul d be stated that these Grades are not necessarily attained fully, an d in strict consecution, or manifested wholly on a ll planes. The subject is ve ry difficult, and e ntirely be yond t he limits of this small treatise. We append a more detailed account . 3. \" The Order of the S. S.\" is composed of those who ha ve crossed the Abyss ; the implications of this expression m ay be studied in Liber 418, t he 14th, 13 th, 12t h, 11th, 10t h, and 9t h Aethyrs in pa rticular. All members of the Order are in full pos session of the Formulae of Attainmen t, bot h mystical or inwardly-directed and M agical or outwardly-directed. They have full experience of attainment in bot h these paths. They are all, how ever, bound by t he original and f unda mental Oath of the Ord er, to de vote their energy to assisting the Progress of their Inferiors in the Order. Those who a ccept the rewards of their emancipation f or themselves are n o longe r within the Order. M embers of the Order are each entitled to found O rders dependent on t hemselv es on t he lines of the R. C. and G . D. orders, to cover types of emancipation a nd illumination not contemplated by t he original (or main) system. All such or ders must, how ever, be constituted in ha rmony w ith the A.'. A.'. as regards the essential principles. All members of the Order are in pos session of the Word of the existing Aeon, and gove rn themselves thereby. They are entitled to communicate directly with any a nd e very member of the O rder, as they may de em fitting. Every active Member of the Order has destroyed all that He is and a ll that h e has on c rossing the Abyss; but a star is cast forth in {233} t he Heavens to e nlighten the Earth, so that he may pos sess a vehicle wherein he may communicate with mankind. The qua lity and pos ition of this star, and its functions, are d etermined by t he nature of the incarnations transcended by hi m. 121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":" 4. The Grade of Ipsissimus is not to be described fully; but its ope ning is indicated in Liber I vel Magi. There is also an account in a certain secret doc ument to be publ ished when pr o priety pe rmits. Here it is only said this: The Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations soever, existing in the nature of all things without discrimin ations of qua ntity or qua lity be tween them. He has identified Being a nd not -Be ing a nd B ecoming, a ction a nd non- action a nd tendency to action, w ith all other such triplicities, not distingui shing be tween them in respect of any c ondi tions , or between any one thing a nd a ny ot her thing a s to whether it is with or with out condi tions. He is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to expres s its nature in word and de ed, but to withdraw Himself at onc e within the veils of his natural manifestation a s a man, and to ke ep silence dur ing hi s hum an li fe as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members of the Order. The Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that i s, his being is entirely free from internal or external necessity. His work is to de stroy a ll tendencies to construct or to cancel such ne cessities. He is t he Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta). The Ipsissimus has no r elation a s such with any B eing: He has no w ill in any direction, a nd no C onsciousness of any ki nd invol ving dua lity, for in Him all is accomplished; as it is written \"beyond t he Word and the Fool, yea, beyond t h e Word and the Fool\". 5. The Grade of Magus is described in Liber I vel Magi, and there are accou nts of its character in Liber 418 i n the Higher Aethyrs. There is also a full and pr ecise description of the attainment of this Grade in the Magical Record of the Beast 666. The essential characteristic of the Grade is that its pos sessor utters a Cre ative Magical Word, w hich transforms the planet on {234} w hich he lives by t he installation of new officers to pr eside ove r its initiation. This can take pla ce only at an \"Equinox of the Gods\" at the end of an \"Aeon\"; that is, when the secret formula which expresses the Law of its action be comes outworn and us eles s to its further developm ent. (Thus \"Suckling\" is the formula of an infant: when teeth appear it marks a new \"Aeon\", whose \"Word\" is \"Eating\"). A Magus can therefore only appear as such to the world at intervals of some centuries; account s of historical Magi, and their Words, are given in Liber Ale ph. This doe s not mean that only one man can attain this Grade in any one Aeon, so far as the Order is concerned. A man can make personal progress equivalent to that of a \"Word of an Aeon\"; but he will identify himself with the current w ord, and e xert his will to establish it, lest he conflict with the work of the Magus who ut tered the Word of the Aeon in which He is living. The Magus is pre-eminently the Master of Magick, that is, his will is entire ly free from internal diversion or external oppos ition; His work is to create a new Universe in accordance with His Will. He is the Master of the Law of Chan ge (Anicca). To attain the Grade of Ipsissimus he must accomplish three tasks, destroying the Three Guardians mentioned in Liber 418, t he 3rd Aethyr; Madness, and F alse hood, a nd G lamour, that is, Duality in Act, Word and Thought . 6. The Grade of Master of the Temple is described in Liber 418 a s above ind icated. There are full account s in the Magical Diaries of the Beast 666, w ho w as cast forth into the Heaven of Jupiter, and of Omnia in Uno, U nus in Omnibus, who w as cast forth into the sphere of the Elements. The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that personality whi ch limits and oppr esses his true self. The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of Mysticism, that is, His U nderstanding is entirely free from internal contradiction or external obs curity 122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"; His word is to comprehend the existing U niverse in accordance with His own M ind. H e is the Master of the Law of Sorrow (Dukkha ). To attain the grade of Magus he must accomplish Three 235} Tasks; the renun ciation of His enjoym ent of the Infinite so that he may formulate Himself as th e Finite; the acquisition of the practical secrets alike of initiating a nd gove rning H is propos ed ne w Universe and the identification of himself with the impe rsonal idea of Love. Any ne ophyt e of the Order (or, as some say, any pe rson s o ever) pos sesses the right to claim the Grade of Master of the Temple by t aking the Oath of the Grade. It is hardly ne cessary to obs erve that to do s o is the most sublime and a wful respons ibility which it is pos sible to assume, and a n un worthy pe rson w ho doe s so incurs the most terrific penalties by hi s presumption . 7. \" The Order of the R. C.\" The Grade of the Babe of the Abyss is not a Gr ade in the proper sense, being r ather a passage between the two Orders. Its ch aracteristics are wholly ne gative, as it is attained by t he resolve of the Adep tus Exemptus to surrender all that he has and is for ever. It is an annihilati on of all the bonds that compose the self or constitute the Cosmos, a resolutio n of all complexities into their elements, and these thereby c ease to manifest, since things are only know able in respect of their relation to, and r eaction o n, ot her things. 8. The Grade of Adeptus Exemptus confers authority to gove rn the two lower Orders of R. C. and G . D. The Adept must prepare and publ ish a thesis setting f orth His know ledge of t he Universe, and hi s propos als for its welfare and pr ogress. He will thus be k now n as the leader of a school of thought . (Eliphas Levi's \"Clef des Grands Mysteres,\" the works of Swedenbor g, von E ck arshausen, R obert Fludd, P aracelsus, Newton, B olyai, Hinton, B erkeley, Loyol a, etc., etc., are examples of such essays.) He will have attained all but the supreme summits of meditation, a nd s houl d be already pr epared to pe rceive that the only pos sible course for him is to de v ote himself utterly to he lping hi s fellow creatures. To attain the Grade of Magister Templi, he must perform two tasks; the emanc ipation f rom thought by put ting e ach idea against its oppos ite, and r efusing to prefer either; and the consecration of {236} hi mself as a pur e vehicle for the influence of the order to which he aspires. He must then de cide upon t he critical adventure of our Order; the absolute a bandonm ent of himself and hi s attainments. He cannot remain indefinitely an Ex empt Adept; he is pus hed onw ard by t he irresistible momentum that he has genera ted. Shoul d he fail, by w ill or weakness, to make his self-annihilation a bsolute, he is none the less thrust forth into the Abyss; but instead of being r eceived and r econstructed in the Third Order, as a Babe in the womb of our Lady B ABALO N, unde r the Night of Pan, to gr ow up t o be Himself wholly and truly as He was not previously, he remains in the Abyss, secreting hi s elements round hi s Ego a s if isolated from the Universe, and be comes what is called a \"Black Brother\". Such a being is gradually disintegrated from lack of nour ishment and the slow but certain action of the attraction of the rest of the Universe, despite effor ts to insulate and pr otect himself, and to aggrandise himself by pr edatory pr ac tices. He may indeed pr osper for a while, but in the end he must perish, espec ially when with a new Aeon a new word is proclaimed which he cannot and w ill no t hear, so that he is handicapped by t rying to us e an obs olete method of Magick , like a man with a boom erang in a battle where every one else has a rifle. 9. The Grade of Adeptus Major confers Magical Powers (strictly so-called) o f the second r ank. His work is to us e these to suppor t the authority of the Exempt Adept his su perior. (This is not to be unde rstood a s an obl igation of personal subservienc e or even loyalty; but as a necessary pa rt of his duty to assist his inferiors. 123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":" For the authority of the Teaching a nd gove rning Adept is the basis of all ord erly work.) To attain the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he must accomplish Three Tasks; the acquisition of absolute Self-Reliance, working in complete isolation, ye t tran smitting the word of his superior clearly, forcibly and s ubtly; and the compreh ension a nd us e of the Revolution of the wheel of force, unde r its three success ive forms of Radiation, C onduc tion a nd C onve ction ( Mercury, Sulphur , Salt; or S attvas, Rajas, Tamas), with their correspondi ng na tures on {237} ot her planes. Thirdly, he must exert his whole pow er and a uthority to gove rn the Members of lower Grades with ba lanced vigour and initiative in such a way as to allow no d ispute or complaint; he must employ to this end the formula called \"The Beast c onjoined with the Woman\" which establishes a new incarnation of deity; as in th e legends of Leda, Semele, Miriam, Pasiphae, and ot hers. He must set up t his i deal for the orders which he rules, so that they may pos sess a not too a bstract rallying poi nt suited to their unde veloped states. 10. The Grade of Adeptus Minor is the main theme of the instructions of the A.'. A.'. It is characterised by t he Attainment of the Know ledge and C onve rsa tion of the Holy Guardian Angel. (See the Equinox, \" The Temple of Solomon the King;\" \"The Vision a nd the Voice\" 8th Aethyr; also \"Liber Samekh\", etc. etc.) This is the essential work of every man; none other ranks with it either for pe rsonal progress or for pow er to he lp one 's fellows. This una chieved, m an is no more than the unha ppiest and bl indest of animals. He is conscious of his own incomprehensible calamity, and c lumsily incapable of repairing it. Achieved, h e is no l ess than the co-heir of gods , a Lord of Light. He is conscious of his own consecrated course, and c onfidently ready to run it. The Adeptus Minor ne eds little help or guidance even from his superiors in our Order. His work is to manifest the Beauty of the Order to the world, in the way tha t his superiors enjoin, and hi s genius dictates. To attain the Grade Adeptus Major, he must accomplish two tasks; the equilib ration of himself, especially as to his passions, so that he has no pr eference for any one course of conduc t ove r another, and the fulfilment of every action by its complement, so that whatever he doe s leaves him without temptation to wa nder from the way of his True Will. Secondl y, he must keep silence, while he nails his body t o the tree of his c reative will, in the shape of that Will, leaving hi s head and a rms to form the symbol of Light, as if to make oath that his every thought , word and de ed shoul d express the Light derived from the God w ith which he has identified his life, his love and hi s liberty --- symbolised by hi s heart, his pha llus, and hi s leg s. It {238} i s impossible to lay dow n pr ecise rules by w hich a man may attain to the know ledge and c onve rsation of His Holy Guardian Angel; for that is the p articular secret of each one of us; as secret not to be told or even divined by any ot her, whatever his grade. It is the Holy of Holies, whereof each man is his own High P riest, and none know eth the Name of his brother's God, or the Rit e that invoke s Him. The Masters of the A.'. A.'. ha ve therefore made no a ttempt to institute any regular ritual for this central Work of their Order, save the generalised inst ructions in Liber 418 ( the 8th Aethyr) and the detailed Canon a nd R ubric of the Mass actually us ed with success by F RATER PERDURABO in His attainment. This h as been written dow n by H imself in Liber Samekh. B ut they ha ve publ ished such account s as those in \"The Temple of Solomon the King\" and in \"John S t. John.\" T hey ha ve taken the only pr oper course; to train aspirants to this attainment in the theory and pr actice of the whole of Magick and M ysticism, so that each man may be expert in the handling of all know n weapons , and f ree to choos e and to use those which his own experience and instinct dictate as proper when he essay s the Great Experiment. He is furthermore trained to the one habit essential to M embership of the A. '. A.'.; he must regard all his attainments as primarily the property of those less advanced aspirants who a re confided to his charge. No attainment soever is officially recogni sed by t he A.'.

M an is one : it is a case of any c onsciousness assuming a sensible form. M icrocosms and e lementals. M aybe an elemental (e.g. a dog) has a cosmic con ception in which he is a microcosm and m an incomplete. No means of deciding s a me, as in case of kinds of space.> Similarly, our gross matter may appear unr eal to Beings clad in fine matter. Thus, science thinks vulgar perceptions \"error\". We cannot perceive at all e xcept within our gamut; as, concentrated pe rfumes, which seem malodor ous, and t ime-hidden facts, such as the vanes of a revolving f an, w hich flies can disting uish. \"Hence:\" no \" a priori\" reason to de ny the existence of conscious intelligenc es with insensible bodi es. Indeed we know of other \"orders\" of mind ( flies, et c., pos sibly ve getables) thinking by m eans of non- hum an br ain-structures. But the funda mental problem of Religion is this: Is there any pr aeter-hum an Intelligence, of the same order as our own, {245} w hich is not dependent on c er ebral structures consisting of matter in the vulgar sense of the word? 2) \"Matter\" includes all that is movable. Thus, electric waves are \"matter\" . There is no r eason to de ny the existence of Beings who pe rceive by ot her mea ns those subtle forces which we only pe rceive by our instruments. 3) We can influence other Beings, conscious or no, a s lion-tamers, gardeners , etc., and a re influenced by t hem, as by s torms, bacilli, etc. 4) There is an apparent gap be tween our senses and their corresponde nces in consciousness. Theory ne eds a medium to join matter and s pirit, just as phys ic s onc e needed an \"ether\" to transmit and transmute vibrations. 5) We may consider all beings as parts of our selves, but it is more conve nie nt to regard them as independent. M aximum Conve nience is our cannon of \"Truth\" .> We may thus refer {246} ps ychical phe nom ena to the intention of \"Astral\" Be ings, without committing our selves to any theory. Coherence is the sole qua lit y de manded of us. 6) Magick enables us to receive sensible impressions of worlds other than t he \"phys ical\" universe (as generally unde rstood by pr ofane science). These wor lds have their own laws; their inhabitants are often of qua si-hum an intelligenc e; there is a definite set of relations between certain \"ideas\" of our s, and th eir expressions, and c ertain types of phe nom ena. (Thus symbols, the Qabalah, et c. enable us to communicate with whom we choos e.) 7) \"Astral\" Beings pos sess know ledge and pow er of a different kind f rom our own; their \"universe\" is presumably of a different kind f rom our s, in some res pects. (Our idea \"bone \" is not the same as a dog's ; a short-sighted man sees t hings differently to one of nor mal vision.) It is more conve nient to assume th e objective existence of an \"Angel\" who gi ves us new know ledge than to allege t hat our invoc ation ha s awakened a supernormal pow er in our selves. Such inciden ts as \"Calderazzo\"> and \" Jacob\"> make this more cogent. {247} 8) The Qabalah maps our selves by m eans of a conve ntion. E very aspect of ev ery obj ect may thus be referred to the Tree of Life, and e voke d by us ing the pr oper keys. 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":" 9) Time and S pace are forms by w hich we obtain (distorted) images of Ideas. Our measures of Time and S pace> are crude conve ntions, and di ffer widely for different Beings. (Hashish show s how the same mind m ay va ry.) 10) We may admit that any a spect of any obj ect or idea may be presented to u s in a symbolic form, whose relation to its Being is irrational. (Thus, there i s no r ational link be tween seeing a bell struck and he aring its chime. Our not ion of \"bell\" is no m ore than a personification of its impressions on our sense s. And our wit and pow er to make a bell \"to or der\" imply a series of correspon dences between va rious orders of nature precisely analogous to M agick, w hen we obtain a Vision of Beauty by t he use of certain colours, forms, sounds , etc.) 11) \"Astral\" Beings may thus be defined in the same way as \"material objects \"; they are the Unknow n Causes of various obs erved effects. They may be of any order of existence. We give a phys ical form and na me to a bell but not to its tone, though i n each case we know nothing but our own impressions. But we rec ord musical sounds by a special conve ntion. We may therefore call a certain se t of qua lities \"Ratziel\", or describe an impression a s \"Saturnian\" without pret ending to know what anything is in itself. All we need is to know how to cast a bell that will please our ears, or how to evoke a \"spirit\" that will tell us things that are hidden from our intellectual faculties. 12) (a) Every obj ect soever may be considered as pos sessed of an \"Astral sha pe\", sensible to our subtle perceptions. This \"astral shape\" is to its materia l basis as our hum an character is to our phys ical appearance. We may imagine t his astral shape: e.g. w e may \"see\" a jar of opium as a soft seductive woman wi th a cruel smile, just as we see in the face of a cunni ng a nd di shone st man the features of some animal, such as a fox. {248} (b) We may select any pa rticular property of any obj ect, and gi ve it an astra l shape. Thus, we may take the tricky pe rils of a mount ain, and pe rsonify them as \"trolls\", or the destructive energies of the simoom , as \"Jinn\". (c) We may analyse any of these symbols, obt aining a finer form; thus the \"s pirit\" contains an \"angel\", the angel an \"archangel\", etc. (d) We may synthesize any s et of symbols, obt aining a more general form. Thu s we may gr oup va rious types of earth-spirit as gnom es. (e) All these may be attributed to the Tree of Life, and de alt with according ly. (f) The Magician may pr epare a sensible body f or any of these symbols, and e v oke them by t he proper rites. 13) The \"reality\" or \"objectivity\" of these symbols is not pertinent to the d iscussion. The ideas of X to the 4 pow er and S q.Rt.of subscript -1 ha ve prov ed us eful to the progress of mathematical advance toward Truth; it is no odds w hether a Fourth Dimension \" exists\", or whether Sq.Rt.of subscript -1 ha s \"mean ing\" in the sense that Sq.Rt.of subscript 4 ha s, the num ber of units in the s ide of a square of 4 uni ts. The Astral Plane --- real or imaginary --- is a danger to anybody w ho takes it without the grain of salt contained in the Wisdom of the above point of view ; who vi olates its laws either wilfully, carelessly, ignor antly, or by pr esumin g that their psychological character differentiates them from phys ical laws in the narrower sense; or who a bdicates his autonom y, on t he ground t hat the subtl er nature of astral phe nom ena gua rantees their authority and integrity. (14) The variety of the general character of the \"planes\" of being is indefin itely large. But there are several main types of symbolism correspondi ng to th e forms of plastic presentation e stablished by t he minds of Mankind. E ach such \"plane\" has its special appearances, inhabitants, and laws --- special cases o f the general propos ition. N otable among t hese are the \"Egypt ian\" plane, which conforms with the ideas and m ethods of magick onc e in vogue in the Nile valley ; the \"Celtic\" plane, close akin to {249} \" Fairyland\", with a Pagan Pantheism a 129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"s its keynot e, sometimes concealed by C hristian nom enclature: the \"Alchemical\" plane, where the Great Work is often pr esented unde r the form of symbolically c onstructed landscapes occupied by qua si-heraldic animals and hum an types hierog lyphi cally distingui shed, w ho c arry on t he mysterious ope rations of the Hermeti c Art. There are also \"planes\" of Parable, of Fable, and of Folk-lore; in short, ev ery count ry, creed, and literature has given its characteristic mode of present ation to some \"plane\" or other. But there are \"planes\" proper to every clairvoya nt who e xplores the Astral L ight without prejudice; in such case, things assume the form of his own mind, a nd hi s perception w ill be clear in pr opor tion to his personal pur ity. On the higher planes, the diversity of form, due to gr ossness, tends to disa ppear. Thus, the Astral Vision of \"Isis\" is utterly unl ike that of \"Kali\". Th e one is of Motherhood a nd Wisdom , ineffably candid, clear, and loving; the oth er of Murder and m adness, blood- intoxicated, lust-befogge d, and c ruel. The sol e link is the Woman-symbol. But whoso makes Samadhi on K ali obtains the self-s ame Illumination a s if it had be en Isis; for in bot h cases he attains identity with the Quintessence of the Woman-Idea, unt rammelled by t he qua lities with whi ch the dwellers by t he Nile and the Ganges respectively disguised it. Thus, in low grades of initiation, dogm atic qua rrels are inflamed by a stral experience; as when Saint John di stingui shes between the Whore BABALON and the Woman clothed with the Sun, be tween the Lamb that was slain and the Beast 666 w hose deadly wound w as healed; nor unde rstands that Satan, the Old Serpent, in t he Abyss, the Lake of Fire and S ulphur , is the Sun-Father, the vibration of Lif e, Lord of Infinite Space that flames with His Consuming E nergy, and is also th at throned Light whose Spirit is suffused throughout the City of Jewels. Each \"plane\" is a veil of the one above it; the original individual Ideas be come diversified as they express their elements. Two men with almost identical ideas on a subject would write two totally different treatises upon i t. 15) The general control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find {250} one 's way about it, to pe netrate such sanctuaries as are gua rded from the profane, to make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to acquire know ledge and pow er, or to command s ervice; all this is a que stion of the general Magical at tainment of the student. He must be absolutely at ease in his Body of Light, and ha ve made it invul ne rable. He must be adept in assuming a ll God-forms, in us ing a ll weapons , sigil s, gestures, words, and s igns. He must be familiar with the names and num bers pertinent to the work in ha nd. H e must be alert, sensitive, and r eady to exert his authority; yet courteous, gracious, patient, and s ympathetic. 16) There are two oppos ite methods of exploring the Astral Plane. (a). One may take some actual object in Nature, and a nalyse it by e voki ng its astral form, thus bringing it into know ledge and unde r control by a pplying the keys of the Qabalah and of Magick. (b). One may pr oceed by i nvoki ng the required idea, and gi ving body t o the sa me by a ttracting to it the correspondi ng e lements in Nature. 17) Every M agician pos sesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself, just as no m an's experience of the world is coterminous with that of another. There wi ll be a general agreement on t he main poi nts, of course; and s o the Master Ther ion is able to de scribe the principal properties of these \"planes\", and their l aws, just as he might write a geography gi ving a n account of the Five Continent s, the Oceans and S eas, the most notable mount ains and r ivers; he could not pre tend to put forth the whole know ledge that any one peasant pos sesses in respect of his district. But, to the peasant, these petty de tails are precisely the m ost important items in his daily life. Likewise, the Magician will be grateful to the Master Therion f or the Compass that guides him at night, the Map that e xtends his comprehension of his count ry, and s how s him how best he may travel a 130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"field, the advice as to Sandals and S taff that make surer his feet, and the Boo k that tells him how , splitting ope n his rocks with an Hammer, he may be master of their Virgin Gold. B ut he will unde rstand that his own {251} c areer on e ar th is his kingdom , that even the Master Therion is no m ore than a fellow man in another valley, and that he must explore and e xploit his own inheritance with his own eyes and ha nds. The Magician must not accept the Master Therion's account of the Astral Plan e, His Qabalistic discoveries, His instructions in M agick. They may be correct in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly true for any s ave Him, eve n as no t wo artists can make identical pictures of the same subject. M ore, even in funda mentals, though t hese things be Truth for all Mankind, a s we carelessly say, any one particular Magician may be the one man for whom the y are false. M ay not the flag that seems red to ten thous and s eem green to som e one other? Then, every man and e very woman be ing a Star, that which is green to him is verily gr een; if he consent to the crowd and c all it red, ha th he no t broken the Staff of Truth that he leaneth upon? Each and e very man therefore that will be a Magician must explore the Univer se for himself. This is pre-eminently the case in the matter of the Astral Pla ne, because the symbols are so sensitive. Nothing is easier than to sugge st vi sions, or to fashion pha ntasms to suit one 's ideas. It is obvi ously impossible to communicate with an independent intelligence --- the one real object of ast ral research --- if one allows one 's imagination to surround one with courtiers of one 's own creation. I f one expects one 's visions to resemble those of the Master Therion, t hey are only too likely to do s o; and if one 's respect for Him induc es one to accept such visions as authentic, one is being f alse to one 's s oul; the visions themselves will avenge it. The true Guide being gone , the see r will stray into a wilderness of terror where he is tricked and tortured; he w ill invoke his idol the Master Therion, a nd f ashion in His image a frightful ph antasm who w ill mock him in his misery, unt il his mind s tagger and f all; and, M adness swoopi ng upon hi s carrion, bl ast his eyes with the hor ror of seeing hi s Master dissolve into that appalling ha llucination, t he \"Vision of THE DEMON CRO WLEY!\" Remember, then, always, but especially when de aling w ith the Astral Plane, t hat man's breath stirs the Feather of Truth. What {252} one sees and he ars is \"real\" in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one 's desires, or crea ted by one 's personality. There is no t ouchstone of truth: the authentic Nakhi el is indistingui shable from the image of the Magician's private idea of Nakhie l, so far as he is concerned. The stronge r one is to create, the more readily the Astral Light responds , and c oagulates creatures of this kind. N ot that suc h creation is necessarily an error; but it is another branch of one 's Work. O n e cannot obtain out side help from inside sources. One must use precautions sim ilar to those recommended in the chapter of Divination. The Magician may go on f or a long t ime being f ooled and f lattered by t he Ast rals that he has himself modified or manufactured. Their natural subservience to himself will please him, poor ape! They will pretend to show him marvellous mysteries, pageants of beauty and w onde r uns peakably splendid; he will incline to accept them as true, for the ver y reason that they are images of himself idealized by t he imagination. But his real progress will stop de ad. These pha ntasms will prevent him from coming into contact with independent intelligences, from whom alone he can lea rn anything ne w. He will become increasingly interested in himself, imagine himself to be att aining one initiation a fter another. His Ego w ill expand unc hecked, till he se em to himself to ha ve heaven at his feet. Yet all this will be nothing but his fool's face of Narcissus smirking up f rom the pool that will drown him. Error of this kind on t he Astral Plane --- in qui te ordinary visions with no apparent moral import --- may lead to the most serious mischief. Firstly, mis takes mislead; to pol lute one 's view of Jupiter by pe rmitting the influence of Venus to distort it may end in finding one self at odds with Jupiter, later on, in some crisis of one 's work. 131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" Secondl y, the habit of making m istakes and leaving them unc orrected gr ows up on one . He who be gins by \" spelling J eheshua with a 'Resh'\" may end by w riting the name of the Dweller on t he Threshold by m istake for that of his Angel. {25 3} Lastly, Magick is a Pyramid, bui lt layer by l ayer. The work of the Body of Light --- with the technique of Yoga --- is the founda tion of the whole. One's apprehension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for Angels, Archangels, and Gods are derived therefrom by a nalysis. One must have pur e materials if one w ishes to br ew pur e beer. If one have an incomplete and incorrect view of the universe, how can one fi nd out its laws? Thus, original omission or error tends to extend to the higher planes. Supp ose a Magician, invoki ng S ol, were persuaded by a plausible spirit of Saturn th at he was the Solar Intelligence required, and ba de him eschew hum an love if he would attain to the Know ledge and C onve rsation of his Holy Guardian Angel; and suppos e that his will, and that Angel's nature, were such that the Crux of the ir Formula was Lyrical Exaltation! Apart from the regular tests --- made at the time --- of the integrity of an y spirit, the Magician must make a careful record of every vision, om itting no detail; he must then make sure that it tallies in every poi nt with the correspo ndences in Book 777 a nd in Liber D. Shoul d he find ( for instance) that, having invoke d M ercury, his vision c ontains names whose num bers are Martial, or eleme nts proper to Pisces, let him set himself most earnestly to discover the source of error, to correct it, and to pr event its recurrence. But these tests, as implied above , will not serve to de tect personation by s elf-sugge sted pha ntasms. Unless one 's aura be a welter of muddl ed symbols beyo nd r ecogni tion, t he more autohypnot ic the vision is, the more smoothly it satis fies the seer's standards. There is nothing to puz zle him or oppos e him; so he spins out his story with careless contempt of criticism. He can always prove himself right; the Qabalah can always be stretched; and R ed be ing s o ne arly Ora nge, which is really a shade of Yellow, and Yellow a compone nt of Green which m erges into Blue, what harm if a Fiend in Vermilion a ppears instead of an Angel in Azure? The true, the final test, of the Truth of one 's visions is their Value. The most glorious experience on t he Astral plane, let it dazzle and thrill as it m ay, is not necessarily in accordance with {254} t he True Will of the seer; if n ot, though i t be never so true objectively, it is not true for him, because not useful for him. (Said we not a while ago that Truth was no m ore than the Most Conve nient Manner of Statement?) It may intoxicate and e xalt the Seer, it may inspire and f ortify him in ever y way, it may throw light upon m ost holy mysteries, yet withal be no m ore than an interpretation of the individual to himself, the formula not of Abraham but of Onan. These plastic \"Portraits of the Artist as a Young M an\" are well enough f or t hose who ha ve heard \"Know Thyself\". They are necessary, even, to assist that a nalysis of one 's nature which the Probationer of A.'. A.'. is sworn to accompli sh. B ut \"Love is the law, love unde r will.\" And O ur Lady N uit is \"... di vide d for love's sake, for the chance of union.\" These mirror-mirages are therefor e not Works of Magick, according to the Law of Thelema: the true Magick of Horu s requires the passionate union of oppos ites. Now the proof that one is in contact with an independent entity de pends on a sensation w hich ought to be unm istakeable if one is in good he alth. O ne ought not to be liable to mistake one 's own sensible impressions for somebody e lse's ! It is only M an's incurable vanity that makes the Astral \"Strayed Reveller\" o r the mystic confuse his own dr unke n ba bble with the voice of the Most High. The essence of the right sensation c onsists in recogni tion of the reality of the other Being. There will be as a rule some element of hos tility, even when the reaction is sympathetic. One's \"soul-mate\" (even) is not thought of as on eself, at first contact. One must therefore insist that any r eal appearance of the Astral Plane gives 132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"the sensation of meeting a stranger. One must accept it as independent, be it Archangel or Elf, and m easure one 's own reaction to it. One must learn from it , though one despise it; and love it, how ever one loathe it. One must realize, on w riting up t he record, that the meeting ha s effected a definite change in one self. One must have know n and f elt something a lien, and not merely tried on a new dress. {255} There must always be some slight pang of pain in a true Astral Vision; it hu rts the Self to ha ve to admit the existence of a not-Self; and it taxes the bra in to register a new thought . This is true at the first touch, even when exalt ation a nd s timulation r esult from the joy of making a n agreeable contact. There is a deeper effect of right reaction to a strange Self: the impact inv ariable tends to br eak up s ome complex in the Seer. The class of ideas concern ed ha s always been tied up, l abelled, and put away. It is now necessary to unp ack it, and r earrange its contents. At least, the annoya nce is like that of a man who ha s locked and s trapped his bag for a journey, and then finds that he h as forgotten his pyjamas. At most, it may revolutionise his ideas of the bus in ess, like an old ba chelor with settled plans of life who m eets a girl onc e too often. Any r eally first-class Astral Vision, e ven on l ow planes, shoul d therefore b oth instruct the Seer, and pr epare him for Initiation. Those failing to pa ss t his test are to be classed as \"practice\". One last obs ervation s eems fit. We must not assert the \"reality\" or \"object ivity\" of an Astral Being on no be tter evidence than the subjective sensation o f its independent existence. We must insist on pr oof patient to all qua lified observers if we are to establish the major premiss of Religion: that there exis ts a Conscious Intelligence independent of brain and ne rve as we know them. If it have also Power, so much the better. But we already know of inorganic forc es; we have no e vidence of inorganic conscious Mind. How can the Astral Plane help us here? It is not enough t o pr ove, as we eas ily do, t he corresponde nces between Invoc ation a nd Apparition> . We must exclud e concidence>, telepathy> , and s ubconscious know ledge.> Our praeter-hum an Inte lligence {256} m ust conve y a Truth not know n to any hum an mind, pa st or present . Yet this Truth must be verifiable. There is but one doc ument in the world which pr esents evidence that fully sa tisfies these condi tions. This is  L IBER AL vel LEGIS  t he Book of the Law. of this New Aeon of Horus, the Crowned and C onque ring C hild, the Aeon w hose Log os is THE BEAST 666, w hose name in the Outer Order was FRATER PERDURABO. The nature of the proof of the separate existence of praeterhum an Intelligen ce, independent of bodi ly form, is extremely complicated. I ts main divisions m ay be briefly enum erated. {257} AIWAZ, the name of the Intelligence in que stion, pr oves: (a) His pow er to pr e-arrange events unc onne cted with His scribe so that they shoul d fit in with that scribe's private calculations. E.g. The Stele which reveals the Theogony of the Book w as officially num ber ed 666, i n the Boulak M useum. The scribe had adopt ed 666 a s His magical num ber , many ye ars previously. Again, the scribe's magical House, bought years earli er, had a name whose value was 418. The scribe had calculated 418 a s the {258} num ber of the Great Work, in 1901 e .v. He only discovered that 418 w as the nu mber of his hous e in consequence of AIWAZ mentioning the fact. (b) His pow er to conceal a coherent system of num bers and letters in the text of a rapidly-written doc ument, containing r iddles and c iphers ope ning to a Mas ter-Key unknow n to the scribe, yet linked with his own system; this Key and its subor dinates being m oreover a comment on t he text. {259} E.g. \" The word of the Law is GR:Theta-Epsilon-Lambda-Eta-Mu-Alpha.\" (Will); this word ha s the value of 93. 133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":" \"Love is the law, love unde r will.\" Love, GR:Alpha-gamma-alpha-pi-eta, lik e GR:Theta-epsilon-lambda-eta-mu-alpha, adds to 93. AIWAZ itself adds to 93.> This was all strange to the scribe; yet years later he discovered the \"Lost Word\" of one of his own Orders: it was 93 a lso.> The Word of His most holy Order proved equally to count up {260} t o 93.> No w 93 i s thrice 31; 31 i s LA, \"Not\" and AL, \"The\" or \"God\"; these words run thro ughout the Book, gi ving a doubl e meaning to many pa ssages. A third 31 i s the c ompound l etter ShT, the two hieroglyphs of Sh and T (many c enturies old) being pictures of the \"Dramatis Personae\" of the Book; and S hT being a haphazard line scrawled on t he MS. touch letters which added to 418, va luing \" this circle squ ared in its failure\" as GR:pi correct to six places of decimals, etc. Again: \"thou s halt know not\">, meaning \" thou s halt know LA\"; and \" he shall d iscover the Key of it all\">, \"id est,\" the Key AL. (c) His pow er to combine subsequent events beyond t he control of the scribe o r his associates, so that they confirmed statements in the Book. O r, per contr a, to pr edict such events. E.g. The first Scarlet Woman pr oved unw orthy, and s uffered the exact penalt ies predicted. Again, \"one cometh after thee; he shall discover the key.\"> This one was to be the \"child\" of the scribe, \"and that strangely\">. Nine months after THE BEAST 666 ha d got ten a Magical \"child\" upon H is concub ine Jane Foster, a \"Babe of the Abyss\" was bor n, Frater Achad asserting hi s rig ht to that grade, and thus \"coming a fter\" THE BEAST 666, w ho ha d be en the last Adept to do s o. And this \"child\" was definitely \"one\", since \"one\" is the mean ing of his motto Achad. F inally, he did in fact \"discover the key of it all\"> after THE BEAST Himself had failed to do s o in 14 ye ars of study. (d) His pow er to conceive and e xpress in concise terms true solutions of the main pr oblems of the Universe. E.g. The formula of Nuith and H adith explain Existence in the terms of Mathe matical-Logical Philosophy , so as to satisfy the difficulties of reconciling D u alism, Monism and N ihilism; all {261} a ntinom ies in all spheres; and the Origin al Perfection w ith the Manifest Imperfection of Things.

Come, in thy na me Iacchus, with thy m ystical fan to winnow the air, each gus t of thy S pirit inspiring our Soul, that we bea r to thee Sons in Thine Image! Verily and Amen!

None but Bacchus, the Holy Guardian Angel, hath gr ace to be God to this ri ot of maniacs; he alone can transform the disorderly rabble into a pageant of h armonious movements, tune their hya ena how ls to the symphony of a paean, and th eir reasonless rage to self-controlled rapture. It is this Angel whose nature is doubl y doubl e, that He may pa rtake of every sacrament. He is at onc e a God who is drunke n with the wine of earth, and the mammal who qua ffs the Blood of G od to pur ge him of mortality. He is a woman as he accepts all impulses, are th ey not His? He is a man to stamp Himself upon w hatever would ha llow itself to Him. He wields the Wand, {263} w ith cone of pine and ivy tendrils; the Angel c reates continually, wreathing H is Will in clinging be auty, imperishably gr een. The Tiger, the symbol of the brutal passions of man, ga mbols about its maste r's heels; and H e bestrides the Ass of Priapus; he makes his sexual force carry him whither He wills to go. Let the Magician therefore adventure himself upon t he Astral Plane with the declared de sign to pe netrate to a sanctuary of discarnate Beings such as are ab le to instruct and f ortify him, also to pr ove their identity by t estimony be yon d rebuttal.

Each phr ase m ust be realized with full concentration of force, so as to m ake Samadhi as perfectly as pos sible upon t he truth pr oclaimed. \"Line 1\" H e identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, a nd the Kether t hereof; one formulation of Hadit in the boundl ess Body of N uith. \"Line 2,3,4\" H e asserts that His Angel has created (for the pur pose of s elf-realization through pr ojection in condi tioned Form) three pa irs of oppos ites: (a) The Fixed and the Volatile; (b) The U nmanifested and the Manifest; and ( c) the Unmoved and the M oved. O therwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of M atter, Mind a nd M otion. \"Line 5\" H e acclaims his Angel as \"Himself Made Perfect\"; adding t hat this Individuality is inscrutable in inviolable. In the N eophyt e Ritual of {274} G .'. D .'. (As it is printed in Equinox I , II, for the old aeon) the Hieropha nt is the perfected O siris, who br ings the candidate, the natural Osiris, to i dentity with himself. But in the new Aeon the Hieropha nt is H orus (Liber CCXX, I, 49) therefore the Candidate will be H orus too. What then is the formula of the initiation of H orus?

It is therefore advisable to replace the name Asar Un-nefer by t hat of Ra-Hoor-Khuit at the outset, and by t hat of one 's own Holy Guardian Angel when it has been c ommunicated. \"Line 6\" H e hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and de vour s G odhe ad, for the pur pose of the Incarnation of any G od. \"Line 7\" H e hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and de vour s Godhe ad, for the pur pose of the Incarnation of any G od. The combined action of these two DEVILS is to allow the G od upon w hom they pr ey to enter into enjoym ent of existence t hrough t he Sacrament of dividual \"Life\" (Bread --- the flesh of BESZ) and \" Love\" (Wine --- the blood or venom of AOPHRASZ). \"Line 8\" H e acclaims His Angel as having \" eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of Know ledge of Good a nd E vil\"; otherwise, having be come w ise (in the {275} D yad, C hokm ah) to apprehend the formula of E quilibrium which is now His own, be ing a ble to apply Himself a ccurately to His self-appoi nted environm ent. \"Line 9\" H e acclaims His Angel as having laid dow n the Law of Love a s the Magical formula of the Universe, that He may resolve t he phe nom enal again into its noum enal pha se by uni ting a ny t wo oppos ites in ecstasic passion. \"Line 10\" H e acclaims His Angel as having a ppoi nted that this formula of Love shoul d effect not only the dissolution of the s eparateness of the Lovers into His own impersonal Godhe ad, but their co-ordination in a \"Child\" quintessentialized from i ts parents to constitute a higher order of Being than theirs, s o that each ge neration is an alchemical progress towards pe rfection in the direction of successive complexities. As L ine 9 asserts Invol ution, L ine 10 a sserts Evolution. \"Line 11\" H e acclaims His Angel as having de vised this method of s elf-realization; the object of Incarnation is to obt ain its r eactions to its relations with other incarnated Beings and to obs erve theirs with each other.  - --------- Section Aa. \"Line 1\" The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious c ommunication w ith His Angel, on t he ground t hat that Angel ha s Himself taught him the Secret Magick by w hich he may make t he proper link. \" Mosheh\" is M H, the formation in Jechidah, C hiah, N eshamah, R uach, --- The Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod - -- since 45 i s GR:Sigma{=summation} 1- 9 while Sh, 300, i s G R:Sigma{=summation} 1- 24, w hich superadds to these Nine an extra F ifteen num bers.

This Commemoration is placed be tween the two pe rsonal appeals to the Angel, as if to claim pr ivilege to pa rtake of this Eucharist which createth, s ustaineth and r edeemeth all things. \"Line 3\" H e now asserts that he is himself the \"Angel\" or messenger of his Angel; that is, that he is a mind a nd body w hose office i s to receive and transmit the Word of his Angel. He hails hi s Angel not only as \"un-nefer\" the Perfection of \"Asar\" hi mself as a man, but as Ptah-Apophr asz-Ra, the identity ( Hadit) wrapped in the Dragon ( Nuit) and thereby m anifested as a Sun ( Ra-Hoor-Khuit). The \"Egg\" (or Heart) \"girt with a S erpent\" is a cogna te symbol; the idea is thus expressed later i n the ritual. (See Liber LXV. which expands this to the ut termost.) Section B The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the s ections now following B to Gg. H e is to travel astrally a round t he circle, making the appropriate pentagrams, sigils, a nd s igns. His direction {277} i s widdershins. He thus makes t hree curves, each covering three-fourths of the circle. He s houl d give the sign of the Enterer on pa ssing the Kiblah, or D irection of Boleskine. This picks up t he force naturally r adiating f rom that point> and pr ojects it in the direction of t he path of the Magician. The sigils are those given i n the Equinox Vol. I, No. 7, P late X outside the s quare; the signs those shewn in Vol. I, No. 2, P late \"The S igns of the Grades\". In these invoc ations he shoul d expand hi s girth and hi s stature to the utmost>, assuming the form and th e consciousness of the Elemental G od of the qua rter.

L et the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge. The \" Firmament\" is the Ruach, the \"mental plane\"; it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus, where revolves the Wheel of the Gunas, the Three forms> of Being. The Aethyr is the {279} \" akasha\", the \"Spirit\", the Aethyr or phys ics, which is the f ramework on w hich all forms are founde d; it receives, records a nd transmits all impulses without itself suffering m utation t hereby. The \"Earth\" is the sphere wherein the ope ration of t hese \"funda mental\" and a ethyric forces appears to pe rception. \" Under the Earth\" is the world of those phe nom ena which inform t hose perceived pr ojections, and de termine their particular c haracter. \"Dry land\" is the place of dead \"material things\", dr y (i.e. unknow able) because una ble to act on our minds. \" Water\" is the vehicle whereby w e feel such things; \"air\" t heir menstruum wherein these feelings are mentally a pprehended. I t is called \"whirling\" because of the i nstability of thought , and the fatuity of reason, on w hich we a re yet dependent for what we call \"life\". \"Rushing F ire\" is t he world in which wandering thought bur ns up t o swift-darting Will. These four stages explain how the non- Ego is transmuted i nto the {280} E go. A \"Spell\" of God is any f orm of c onsciousness, and a \"Scourge\" any f orm of action. The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every de tail of the Universe which His Angel has created as a means of manifesting H imself to Himself. It covers command of the primary pr ojection of the Possible in individuality, in t he antithetical artifice which is the device of Mind, a nd in a balanced triplicity of modes or states of being w hose c ombinations constitute the characteristics of Cosmos. It i ncludes also a standard of structure, a rigidity to make r eference pos sible. Upon t hese founda tions of condi tion w hich a re not things in themselves, but the canon t o which things c onform, is builded the Temple of Being, w hose materials are t hemselves perfectly mysterious, inscrutable as the Soul, and l ike the Soul imagining themselves by s ymbols which we may f eel, perceive, and a dapt to our use without ever know ing the w hole Truth about them. The Adept sums up a ll these items by c laiming a uthority ove r every form of expression pos sible to E xistence, whether it be a \"spell\" (idea) or a \"scourge\" (act) of \"God\", that is, of himself. The Adept must accept every \" spirit\", every \"spell\", every \"scourge\", as part of his e nvironm ent, and m ake them all \"subject to\" himself; that is, c onsider them as contributory causes of himself. They ha ve m ade him what he is. They correspond e xactly to his own f aculties. They are all --- ultimately --- of equal i mportance. The fact that he is what he is proves that each i tem is equilibrated. The impact of each ne w impression a ffects the entire system in due measure. He must therefore r ealize that every event is subject to him. It occurs because he had ne ed of it. Iron r usts because the molecules demand oxyge n for the satisfaction of {281} t heir tendencies.

As practice makes the Adept pe rfect in this Work, it becomes automatic to attach all these c omplicated ideas and intentions to their correlated words and a cts. When this is attained he may go de eper into the formula by a mplifying its corresponde nces. Thus, he may invoke water i n the manner of water, extending {282} hi s will with majestic a nd irresistible motion, m indful of its impulse gravitation, ye t with a suave and tranqui l appearance of weakness.

With these words the Adept doe s not withdraw his will w ithin him as in the previous Sections. He thinks of them as a reflection of Truth on t he {283} s urface of the dew, where hi s Soul hides trembling. H e takes them to be the first f ormulation in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy G uardian Angel. \"Line 1.\" The \"Gods\" include all the conscious elements of his na ture. \"Line 2.\" The \"Universe\" includes all pos sible phe nom ena of which he c an be aware. \"Line 3.\" The \"Winds\" are his thought s, which ha ve prevented him from a ttaining to his Angel. \"Line 4.\" H is Angel has made \"Voice\", the magical weapon w hich pr oduc es \"Words\", and these words have been the wisdom by w hich He hath created all things. The \"Voice\" is necessary as t he link be tween the Adept and hi s Angel. The Angel is \" King\", the One who \" can\", the \"source of authority and the f ount of honour \"; also the King ( or King's Son) who de livers t he Enchanted Princess, and m akes her his Queen. H e is \" Ruler\", the \"unconscious Will\"; to be thwarted no m ore by t he i gnor ant and c apricious false will of the conscious man.

The \"Hear me\" clause is now ut tered by t he nor mal hum an consciousness, withdrawn to the phys ical body; the Adept must deliberately abandon hi s a ttainment, because it is not yet his whole being w hich bur ns up be fore the Beloved.  - ------- Section G .

Thus then shall the Adept be aware that he is being s wept away through t he column of his Will Symbol, {285} a nd that His Angel is indeed hi mself, with intimacy so intense as to be come identity, and t hat not in a single Ego, but in every unc onscious element t hat shares in that manifold upr ush.

This di spersion de stroys the concentration of the adept, whose mind c annot master such multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, he s imply sinks stunne d into nor mality, to recall nothing of his e xperience but a vague though vi vid impression of complete r elease and ineffable rapture. Repetition f ortifies him to r ealise the nature of his attainment; and hi s Angel, the link onc e made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be s ensitive to his Holy pr esence, and pe rsuasion. B ut it may oc cur, especially after repeated success, that the Adept is not flung ba ck into his mortality by t he explosion of the S tar-spate, but identified with one particular \"Lion-Serpent\", c ontinuing c onscious thereof until it finds its proper place i n Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, w hich t he Adept may then take back to earth with him. This is but a side issue. The main pur pose of the Ritual i s to establish the relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Adept is aware that his Angel is t he Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements of that S elf, that his nor mal consciousness contains alien enemies 286} i ntroduc ed by t he accidents of environm ent, and that his K now ledge and C onve rsation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys a ll doubt s and de lusions, confers all blessings, teaches all t ruth, and c ontains all delights.

Thus in this section the adept utters articulately s o far as words may, what his Angel is to Himself. He says t his, with his Scin-Laeca wholly withdrawn into his phys ical body , constraining H is Angel to indw ell his heart. \"Line 1.\" \" I am He\" asserts the destruction of the sense of s eparateness between self and S elf.

The \" Immortal Fire\" is the creative Self; impersonal energy c annot pe rish, no m atter what forms it assumes. Combustion is Love. 287 \"Line 2.\" \" Truth\" is the necessary relation of any two things; t herefore, although i t implies dua lity, it enables us to c onceive of two things as being one thing s uch that it demands t o be defined by c omplementals. Thus, an hype rbola is a s imple idea, but its construction e xacts two curves. \"Line 3.\" The Angel, as the adept know s him, is a being Tiphereth, w hich obs cures Kether. The Adept is not officially aware of t he higher Sephiroth. H e cannot perceive, like the I psissimus, that all things soever are equally illusion a nd e qually Absolute. He is in Tiphereth, w hose office is R edemption, a nd he deplores the events which ha ve caused the a pparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped. H e is also a ware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and de fects of his Attainment. \"Line 4.\" This refers to the phe nom ena which accompany hi s Attainment. \"Line 5.\" This means the recogni tion of the Angel as the True Self of hi s subconscious self, the hidden Life of his phys ical life. \"Line 6.\" The Adept realises every br eath, every word of his Angel as c harged with creative fire. Tiphereth is the Sun, a nd the Angel is the spiritual Sun of the Soul of the Adept. \"Line 7.\" H ere is summed the entire process of bringing the c ondi tioned Universe to know ledge of itself through t he f ormula of generation> ; a soul implants itself in sense-hoodw inked body a nd r eason- f ettered mind, m akes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to pa rtake of its own consciousness of the Light. \"Line 8.\" \" Grace\" has here its proper sense of \"Pleasantness\". {288} The existence of the Angel is the justification of the device of creation.> \"Line 9.\" This line must be studied in the light of Liber LXV ( Equinox X I. p. 65) .

The Adept who ha s mastered this Ritual, successfully realising the full impo rt of this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to loosen its grip o n the astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or Soul-symbol, or even to forget its duty to the body a nd the sensible surroundi ngs. Nor shoul d he omit to ke ep his Body of Light in close touch with the phe nom ena of its own plane, so that its privy c onsciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting h is scattered ideals from obs ession. But he shoul d ha ve acquired, by pr evious practice, the faculty of detaching these elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that they become (temporarily) independent respons ible units, capable of receiving c ommun ications from headqua rters at will, but perfectly able (1) to take care of them selves without troubl ing their chief, and ( 2) to report to him at the proper ti me. In a figure, they must be like subor dinate officers, expected to display s elf-reliance, initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the D ay. The Adept shoul d therefore be able to rely on t hese individual minds of his to control their own condi tions without interference from himself for the time required, and to recall them in due course, receiving a n accurate report of the ir adventures. This being s o, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that part of him which unc onsciously or ders his true Will, upon t he realization of h is Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodi ly, mental and a stral conscious ness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which ha s made him deaf to his Soul, and hi s preoccupation w ith their affairs that has prevented him from perceiving that Soul. {294} The effect of the Ritual has been (a) to ke ep them so bus y with their own work that they cease to distract him ; (b) to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths; (c) to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and a naesthet ize him, that he may not feel and r esent the agony of this spiritual vivisectio n, just as bashful lovers get drunk on t he wedding ni ght, in or der to br azen ou t the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire; (d) to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and f l ing them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; an d (e) to attract the Angel by t he vibration of the magical voice which invoke s Him. 151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" The method of the Ritual is thus manifold. There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate hi s course of action. H e can de cide what must be banished, w hat pur ified, w hat c oncentrated. H e can then concentrate his will upon i ts one essential element, over-coming its resistance --- which is automatic, like a phys iological reflex --- by de stroying inhibitions through hi s ego-overwhelming e nthusiasm.> The ot her half of the work ne eds no s uch complex effort; for his Angel is simple and unpe rplexed, ready a t all times to respond t o rightly or dered approach. {295} But the results of the Ritual are too va rious to pe rmit of rigid de scription . One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not reta in any m emory soever of what has occurred. H e may be merely aware of a gap in his conscious life, and judge of its contents by obs erving that his nature has been subtly transfigured. S uch an experience might indeed be the proof of perf ection. If the Adept is to be any w ise conscious of his Angel it must be that some p art of his mind is prepared to realise the rapture, and to express it to itself in one way or another. This invol ves the perfection of that part, its freedom from prejudice and the limitations of rationality so-called. F or instance: on e could not receive the illumination a s to the nature of life which the doc trin e of evolution s houl d shed, if one is passionately pe rsuaded that hum anity is e ssentially not animal, or convi nced that causality is repugna nt to reason. The Adept must be ready f or the utter destruction of his point of view on a ny s ubj ect, and e ven that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought .> Thus he may find that his Angel consider his \"business\" or his \"love\" to be ab surd trifles; also that hum an ideas of \"time\" are invalid, and hum an \"laws\" of logic applicable only to the relations between illusions. Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any poi nt that is sensitiv e to His influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is salient in the Adept's character, and a lso one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pur e> . Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to {296} r ece ive a visual impression of his Angel in a phys ical form which is sublimely qui n tessential of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by m ajestic melodies such as he never hope d to he ar. A philosophe r may attain apprehension of tremendou s truths, the solution of problems that had ba ffled him all his life. Conformably with this doc trine, we read of illuminations experienced by s imp le-minded men, such as a workman who \" saw God\" and likened Him to \"a qua ntity o f little pears\". Again, w e know that ecstasy, impinging upon unba lanced minds, inflames the idolised idea, and pr oduc es fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy , with intolerance and insanely disordered energy w hich is yet so pow erful as t o effect the destinies of empires. But the phe nom ena of the Know ledge and C onve rsation of the Holy Guardian Ang el are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy. Their intimacy (or rather identity) is independent of all partial forms of expression; at its best it is therefore as inarticulate as Love. The intensity of the consummation w ill more probably compel a sob or a cry, some natural phys ical gesture of animal sympathy w ith the spiritual spasm. Thi s is to be criticised as incomplete self-control. Silence is nobl er. In any c ase the Adept must be in communion w ith his Angel, so that his Soul is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect. It is evident that the stress of such spiritual pos session m ust tend to ove rwh elm the soul, especially at first. It actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, just as extreme love produc es vertigo. The soul sinks and s woons . Su ch weakness is fatal alike to its enjoym ent and its apprehension. \" Be strong! then canst thou be ar more rapture!\" sayeth the Book of the Law.> The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing hi mself to ha rden his soul. To this end, I , the Beast, have made trial and pr oof of divers devices. Of these the most potent is to set the body t o strive with {297} t he soul. Let th e muscles take grip on t hemselves as if one were wrestling. L et the jaw and m o uth, in pa rticular, be tightened to the utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet st 152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"rongl y. Keep mastery ove r the mind by m uttering f orcibly and a udibly. But les t such muttering tend to disturb communion w ith the Angel, speak onl y His Name. Until the Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perf ect pos session of his Beloved. H is most important task is thus to ope n his ear s to the voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called. F or heark en! this Name, unde rstood r ightly and f ully, declareth the nature of the Angel in every poi nt, wherefore also that Name is the formula of the perfection to wh ich the Adept must aspire, and a lso of the pow er of Magick by vi rtue whereof he must work. He then that is as yet ignor ant of that Name, let him repeat a word worthy o f this particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon, w hich si gnifieth \"The Great Work accomplished\"; and Aumgn interpreted in Part III of Bo ok 4> ; and the name of THE BEAST, for that His num ber show eth forth this Union with the Angel, and H is Work is no ot her than to make all men pa rtakers of this Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick. So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel and w ithstand H im, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communion unt il the consciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, a nd of accurate tr ansmission> of the {298} t ranscendent Truth of the Beloved to the heart that ho lds him. The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maint ain the state of Union f or several minutes, even at first. In any c ase he must rekindle his ardour , esteeming hi s success rather as an encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. H e shoul d increase his efforts. Let him beware of the \"lust of result\", of expecting too m uch, of losing c ou rage if his first success is followed by a series of failures. For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create an in hibition f atal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the fear intrudes up on the concentration a nd s o fulfils its own pr ophe cy. We know how too m uch ple asure in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace one self on t he next few occ asions; indeed, unt il familiarity ha s accustomed one to the idea that one 's lov er has never suppos ed one to be more than hum an. C onfidence returns gradually. Inarticulate ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoym ent of the elements of the fascination. Just so one 's first dazzled de light in a new landscape turns, as one continu es to ga ze, to the appreciation of exqui site details of the view. At first the y were blurred by t he blinding r ush of general beauty; they emerge one by one a s the shock subsides, and pa ssionate rapture yields to intelligent interest. In the same way the Adept almost always begins by t orrential lyrics painting out mystical extravagances about \"ineffable love\", \"unimaginable bliss\", \"inex pressible infinities of illimitable utterness\".> He usually loses his sense of propor tion, of hum our, of reality, and of sound j udgm ent. His ego is often in flated to the bur sting poi nt, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were n ot so pitifully da ngerous to himself and ot hers. He also tends to take his new -found \" truths of illumination\" for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must be as valid an vital for all men as they ha ppen to be for himself. { 299} It is wise to ke ep silence about those things \"unlawful to utter\" which one may ha ve heard \"in the seventh he aven\". This may not apply to the sixth. The Adept must keep himself in ha nd, how ever tempted to make a new heaven an d a new earth in the next few days by t rumpeting hi s triumphs. He must give ti me a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by t he impact of the Infinite. As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find hi s passi onate ecstasy de velop a qua lity of peace and intelligibility which adds pow er, while it informs and f ortifies his mental and m oral qua lities instead of obs cur ing a nd ups etting them. He will by now have become able to conve rse with his A ngel, impossible as it onc e seemed; for he now know s that the storm of sound w h ich he suppos ed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions.

The truth told by t he Angel, immensely as it extends the hor izon of the Adep t, is perfectly de finite and pr ecise. It doe s not deal in ambiguities and a bst ractions. It pos sesses form, and c onfesses law, in exactly the same way and de gree as any ot her body of truth. I t is to the truth of the material and intell ectual spheres of man ve ry much what the Mathematics of Philosophy w ith its \"in finite series\" and \" Cantorian continuity\" is to school boy a rithmetic. Each imp lies the other, though by t hat one may explore the essential nature of existenc e, and by t his a pawnbroker's profits. This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole ope ration, t o assimilat e himself to his Angel by c ontinual conscious communion. F or his Angel is an i ntelligible image of his own true Will, to do w hich is the whole of the law of his Being. Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, w hich is the heart of the Ruach, and thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind. I t is also directly inspired from Keth er, the ultimate Self, through t he Path of the High P riestess, or initiated int uition. H ence the Angel is in truth the Logos or articulate expression of the whole Being of the Adept, so that as he increases in the perfect unde rstanding of {300} H is name, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, Who he h imself truly is. Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him; for the Tiphereth-consciousness alone is conne cted by pa ths with the various parts of his mind.> None therefore save He hath the know ledge requisite for calculating the combinations of conduc t which will organise and e quilibrate the forces of the Adept, against the moment when it becomes necessary to confront the Abyss. The Adept must control a compact and c oherent mass if he is to make sure of hu rling it from him with a clean-cut gesture. I, The Beast 666, l ift up m y voi ce and s wear that I myself have been br ought hither by m ine Angel. After that I had attained unt o the Know ledge and C onve r sation of Him by vi rtue of mine ardour towards Him, and of this Ritual that I b estow upon m en my fellows, and m ost of His great Love that He beareth to me, ye a, verily, He led me to the Abyss; He bade me fling a way all that I had and a ll that I was; and H e forsook m e in that Hour. But when I came beyond t he Abyss, to be reborn within the womb of BABALON, then came he unto me abiding in my vi rgin he art, its Lord and L over! Also He made me a Magus, speaking through H is Law, the Word of the new Aeon, the Aeon of the Crowned and C onque ring C hild.> Thus he fulfilled my will to br ing f ull freedom to the race of Men. Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of wonde r beyond t his, but in this matter I am sworn to hol d my pe ace. {301}  APPENDIX V A FEW OF THE PRINCIPAL CORRESPONDENCES  O F THE QABALAH.

The FINAL GESTURE. This is identical with the First Gesture. (Here followeth an impression of the ideas implied in this Paean.) {334} I also am a Star in Space, uni que and s elf-existent, an individual essence i ncorruptible; I also am one Soul; I am identical with All and N one. I am in Al l and a ll in M e; I am, apart from all and lord of all, and one with all. I am a God, I very God of very God; I go upon m y way to work my will; I have made matter and m otion f or my mirror; I have decreed for my de light that Nothi ngne ss shoul d figure itself as twain, that I might dream a dance of names and n atures, and e njoy the substance of simplicity by w atching the wanderings of my shadow s. I am not that which is not; I know not that which know s not; I love n ot that which loves not. For I am Love, whereby di vision di es in de light; I am Know ledge, whereby a ll parts, plunge d in the whole, perish and pa ss into pe rfe ction; and I am that I am, the being w herein Being is lost in Nothing, nor deig ns to be but by i ts Will to unf old its nature, its need to express its perfecti on in all pos sibilities, each pha se a partial pha ntasm, and ye t inevitable and absolute. I am Omniscient, for naught exists for me unless I know it. I am Omnipotent , for naught occurs save by N ecessity my soul's expression through m y will to b e, to do, t o suffer the symbols of itself. I am Omnipresent, for naught exists where I am not, who f ashioned space as a condi tion of my consciousness of myse lf, who a m the centre of all, and m y circumference the frame of mine own fancy. 174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" I am the All, for all that exists for me is a necessary expression in though t of some tendency of my na ture, and a ll my thought s are only the letters of my Name. I am the One, for all that I am is not the absolute all, and a ll my all is m ine and not another's; mine, who c onceive of others like myself in essence and truth, ye t unlike in expression a nd illusion. I am the None, for all that I am is the imperfect image of the perfect; each partial pha ntom must perish in the clasp of its count erpart; each form fulfil itself by f inding its equated oppos ite, and s atisfying its need to be the Absol ute by t he attainment of annihilation. The word, L AShTAL includes all this. \"LA\" --- Naught . {335} \"AL\" --- Two. \"L\" is \"Justice\", the Kteis fulfilled by t he Phallus, \"Naught and Two\" becau se the plus and the minus have united in \"love unde r will.\" \"A\" is \"the Fool\", Naught in Thought (Parzival), Word (Harpocrates), and Act ion ( Bacchus). He is the boundl ess air, the wandering G host, but with \"possibi lities\". He is the Naught that the Two ha ve made by \" love unde r will\". \"LA\" thus represents the Ecstasy of Nuit and H adit conjoined, lost in love, and m aking themselves Naught thereby. Their child is begotten and c onceived, b ut is in the pha se of Naught also, as yet. \"LA\" is thus the Universe in that p hase, with its potentialities of manifestation. \"AL\" on t he contarary, though i t is essentially identical with \"LA\", show s t he Fool manifested through t he Equilibrium of Contraries. The weight is still nothing, but it is expressed as if it were two equal weights in oppos ite scales . The indicator still points to zero. \"ShT\" is equally 31 w ith \"LA\" and \" AL\", but it expresses the secret nature w hich ope rates the Magick or the transmutations. \"ShT\" is the formula of this particular aeon; another aeon m ight have anothe r way of saying 31. \"Sh\" is Fire as T is Force; conjoined they express Ra-Hoor-Khuit. \"The Angel\" represents the Stele 666, s how ing the Gods of the Aeon, w hile \"S trength\" is a picture of Babalon a nd The Beast, the earthly emissaries of those Gods. \"ShT\" is the dyna mic equivalent of \"LA\" and \" AL\". \"Sh\" show s the Word of th e Law, being triple, as 93 i s thrice 31. \" T\" show s the formula of Magick de cla red in that Word; the Lion, t he Serpent, the Sun, C ourage and S exual Love are a ll indicated by t he card. In \"LA\" note that Saturn or Satan is exalted in the House of Venus or Astart e, and it is an airy sign. Thus \"L\" is Father-Mother, Two and N aught , and the Spirit (Holy Ghost) of their Love is also Naught . Love is AHBH, 13, w hich is A ChD, Unity, I, Aleph, w ho is The Fool who is Naught , but none the less an Indiv idual One, who ( as such) is not another, yet unc onscious of himself until his O neness expresses itself as a dua lity. Any impression or idea is unknow able in itself. It can mean {336} not hing u ntil brought into relation w ith other things. The first step is to distingui sh one thought from another; this is the condi tion of recogni zing it. To de fine it, we must perceive its orientation to all our other ideas. The extent of our know ledge of any one thing va ries therefore with the num ber of ideas with whic h we can compare it. Every ne w fact not only adds itself to our universe, but increases the value of what we already pos sess. In \"AL\" this \"The\" or \"God\" arranges for \"Contenance to be hold contenance\", by e stablishing itself as an equilibrium, \"A\" the One-Naught conceived as \"L\" t he Two-Naught . This \"L\" is the Son-Daught er Horus-Harpocrates just as the othe r \"L\" was the Father-Mother Set-Isis. Here then is Tetragrammaton onc e more, b ut expressed in identical equations in which every term is perfect in itself as a mode of Naught . \"ShT\" suppl ies the last element; making the Word of either five or six lette rs, according a s we regard \"ShT\" as one letter or two. Thus the Word affirms t he Great Work accomplished: 5 D egree = 6Square. 175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":" \"ShT\", is moreover a necessary resolution of the apparent oppos ition of \"LA\" and \" AL\"; for one could ha rdly pa ss to the other without the catalytic action of a third identical expression w hose function s houl d be to transmute them. Su ch a term must be in itself a mode of Naught , and its nature cannot encroach on the perfections of Not-Being, \" LA\" or of Being, \" AL\". It must be pur ely Nothi ng-Matter, so as to create a Matter-in-Motion w hich is a function of \"Something \". Thus \"ShT\" is Motion in its doubl e pha se, an inertia composed of two oppos it e currents, and e ach current is also thus polarized. \" Sh\" is Heaven and E arth, \"T\" Male and F emale; \"ShT\" is Spirit and M atter; one is the word of Liberty an d Love flashing its Light to restore Life to Earth; the other is the act by w hi ch Life claims that Love is Light and L iberty. And these are Two-in-One, the d ivine letter of Silence-in-Speech whose symbol is the Sun in the arms of the Mo on. But \"Sh\" and \" T\" are alike formulae of force in action a s oppos ed to entitie s; they are not states of existence, but modes of motion. They are verbs, not nouns . \"Sh\" is the Holy Spirit as a \"tongue of fire\" manifest in triplicity, {337} and is the child of Set-Isis as their Logos or Word uttered by t heir \"Angel\". The card is XX, and 20 i s the value of Yod ( the Angel or Herald) expressed in f ull as IVD. \"Sh\" is the Spiritual congr ess of Heaven and E arth. But \"T\" is the Holy Spirit in action a s a \"roaring lion\" or as the \"old Serp ent\" instead of as an \"Angel of Light\". The twins of Set-Isis, harlot and be as t, are bus y with that sodom itic and incestuous lust which is the traditional fo rmula for produc ing de mi-gods , as in the cases of Mary and the Dove; Leda and t he Swan, etc. The card is XI, the num ber of Magick AVD: Aleph the Fool impregn ating the woman according to the word of Yod, t he Angel of the Lord! His siste r has seduced he r brother Beast, shaming the Sun w ith he r sin; she has mastered the Lion a nd e nchanted the Serpent. Nature is outraged by M agick; man is best ialized and w oman de filed. The conjunction pr oduc es a monster; it affirms regr ession of types. Instead of a man-God c onceived of the Spirit of God by a virg in in innoc ence, we are asked to adore the bastard of a whore and a brute, bego tten in shamefullest sin and bor n in most blasphemous bliss. This is in fact the formula of our Magick; we insist that all acts must be e qual; that existence asserts the right to exist; that unless evil is a mere ter m expressing s ome relation of haphazard hos tility be tween forces equally self-j ustified, the universe is as inexplicable and impossible as unc ompensated actio n: that the orgies of Bacchus and P an are no l ess sacremental than the Masses o f Jesus; that the scars of syphi lis are sacred and w orthy of honour as such. It shoul d be unne cessary to insist that the above ideas apply onl y to the Ab solute. Toothache is still painful, and de ceit degrading, t o a man, relatively to his situation in the world of illusion; he doe s his Will by a voiding them. But the existence of \"Evil\" is fatal to phi losophy s o long a s it is suppos ed t o be independent of condi tions; and to accustom the mind \" to make no di fference \" between any two ideas as such is to emancipate it from the thralldom of terro r. We affirm on our altars our faith in our selves and our wills, our love of al l aspects of the Absolute All. {338} And w e make the Spirit Shin combine with the Flesh Teth into a single letter , whose value is 31 e ven as those of \"LA\" the Naught , and \" AL\" the All, to comp lete their Not-Being a nd B eing w ith its Becoming, t o mediate between identical extremes as their mean --- the secret that sunde rs and s eals them. It declares that all somethings are equally shadow s of Nothing, a nd justifie s Nothing in its futile folly of pretending that something is stable, by m aking us aware of a method of Magick through t he practice of which we may pa rtake in the pleasure of the process. The Magician shoul d de vise for himself a definite technique for destroying \" evil\". The essence of such a practice will consist in training the mind a nd th e body t o confront things which cause fear, pain, di sgust,> shame and the like. He must learn to endur e them, then to be come indifferent to them, then to ana 176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"lyse them until they give pleasure and instruction, a nd f inally to appreciate t hem for their own sake, as aspects of Truth. When this has been done , he shoul d abandon t hem if they are really ha rmful in relation to he alth or comfort. Al so, our selection of \"evils\" is limited to those that cannot damage us irrepara bly. E.g., one ought to pr actise smellying a ssafoetida until one likes it; but not arsine or hydr ocyanic acid. Again, one might have a liaison w ith an ugl y old woman unt il one beheld and loved the star which she is; it would be too da n gerous to ove rcome the distaste for dishone sty by f orcing one self to pick poc ke ts. Acts which are essentially dishonour able must not be done ; they shoul d be justified onl y by c alm contemplation of their correctness in abstract cases. Love is a virtue; it grows stronge r and pur er and less selfish by a pplying i t to what it loathes; but theft is a vice invol ving the slave-idea that one 's n eighbour is superior to one self. It is admirable only for its pow er to de velop certain moral and m ental qua lities in pr imitive types, to pr event the atrophy of such faculties as our own vigilance, and f or the interest which it adds to t he \"tragedy, Man.\" {339} Crime, folly, sickness and a ll such phe nom ena must be contemplated with comp lete freedom from fear, aversion, or shame. Otherwise we shall fail to see acc urately, and interpret intelligently; in which case we shall be una ble to out wi t and out fight them. Anatomists and phys iologists, grappling in the dark with death, ha ve won hygi ene, surgery, prophyl axis and the rest for mankind. Anthro pologists, archaeologists, phys icists and ot her men of science, risking thum bsc rew, stake, infamy and os tracism, have torn the spider-snare of superstition to shreds and br oken in pieces the monstrous idol of Morality, the murderous Molo ch which ha s made mankind its meat throughout history. Each fragment of that c oprolite is manifest as an image of some brute lust, some torpid dul lness, some ignor ant instinct, or some furtive fear shapen in his own savage mind. M an is indeed not wholly freed, even now . He is still trampled unde r the ho ofs of the stampeding m ules that nightmare bor e to his wild ass, his creative f orces that he had not mastered, the sterile ghos ts that he called gods . Their mystery cows men still; they fear, they flinch, they da re not face the pha ntoms . Still, too, t he fallen fetich seems awful; it is frightful to them that ther e is no l onge r an idol to adore with anthems, and to appease with the flesh of their firstborn. E ach scrambles in the bloody m ire of the floor to snatch some scrap for a relic, that he may bow dow n to it and s erve it. So, even to-day, a mass of maggot s swarm heaving ove r the carrion e arth, a b rotherhood bound by bl ind gr eed for rottenness. Science still hesitates to raz e the temple of Rimmon, t hough e very ye ar finds more of her sons impatient of N aaman's prudence. The Privy C ounc il of the Kingdom of Mansoul sits in pe rmanen t secret session; it dares not declare what must follow its deed in shattering the monarch morality into scraps of crumbling c ongl omerate of climatic, tribal, and pe rsonal prejudices, corrupted ye t more by t he action of crafty ambition, insane impulse, ignor ant arrogance, superstitious hys teria, fear fashioning f al sehoods on t he stone that it sets on t he grave of Truth whom it has murdered an d bur ied in the black earth Oblivion. M oral philosophy , psychology, sociology, anthropol ogy, mental pathology, phys iology, and m any a nother of {340} t he chil dren of wisdom , of whom she is justified, w ell know that the laws of Ethics are a chaos of confused conve ntions, based at best on c ustoms conve nient in certai n condi tions, more often on t he craft or caprice of the biggest, the most savag e, heartless, cunni ng a nd bl ood- thirsty br utes of the pack, to secure their pow er or pander to their pleasure in cruelty. There is no pr inciple, even a false one , to give coherence to the clamour of ethical propos itions. Yet the very m en that have smashed M oloch, and s trewn the earth with shapeless rubbl e, grow p ale when they so much as whisper among t hemselves, \"While Moloch ruled all men were bound by t he one law, and by t he oracles of them that, know ing the fraud, feared not , but were his priests and w ardens of his mystery.

The last fifty ye ars have laid the axe of analysis to the root of every axiom; they are triflers who c ontent themselves with loppi ng the blossoming twigs of our beliefs, or the boughs of our intellectual instr uments. We can no l onge r assert any s ingle propos ition, unl ess we gua rd our sel ves by e num erating c ount less condi tions which must be assumed.

The Magician must be wary in his use of his pow ers; he must make every act n ot only accord with his Will, but with the proprieties of his pos ition a t the t ime. It might be my will to reach {341} t he foot of a cliff; but the easiest w ay --- also the speediest, most direct, least obs tructed, the way of minimum ef fort --- would be simply to jump. I shoul d ha ve destroyed my will in the act o f fulfilling it, or what I mistook f or it; for the true will has no goa l; its n ature being to Go. S imilarly a parabola is bound by one law which fixes its re lations with two straight lines at every poi nt; yet it has no e nd s hort of infi nity, and it continually changes its direction. The initiate who is aware Who he is can always check his conduc t by r eference to the determinants of his curv e, and c alculate his past, his future, his bearings and hi s proper course at an y assigned moment; he can even comprehend hi mself as a simple idea. He may att ain to measure fellow-parabolas, ellipses that cross his path, hype rbolas that span all space with their twin wings. Perhaps he may come at long l ast, leapin g be yond t he limits of his own law, to conceive that sublimely stupendous outra ge to Reason, t he Cone! Utterly inscrutable to him, he is yet well aware that he exists in the nature thereof, that he is necessary thereto, that he is order ed thereby, and that therefrom he is sprung, f rom the loins of so fearful a Fat her! His own infinity be comes zero in relation to that of the least fragment o f the solid. H e hardly exists at all. Trillions multiplied by t rillions of tr illions of such as he could not cross the frontier even of breadth, the idea wh ich he came to gue ss at only be cause he felt himself bound by s ome mysterious p ower. Yet breadth is equally a nothing in the presence of the Cone. His first conception m ust evidently be a frantic spasm, formless, insane, not to be clas sed as articulate thought . Yet, if he develops the faculties of his mind, t he more he know s of it the more he sees that its nature is identical with his own whenever comparison is pos sible. The True Will is thus both de termined by i ts equations, and f ree because tho se equations are simply its own na me, spelt out fully. His sense of being unde r bonda ge comes from his inability to read it; his sense that evil exists to th wart him arises when he begins to learn to read, reads wrong, a nd is obs tinate that his error is an improvement. We know one thing onl y. Absolute existence, absolute motion, a bsolute direc tion, a bsolute simultaneity, absolute truth, all such {342} i deas; they ha ve no t, and ne ver can ha ve, any r eal meaning. I f a man in de lirium tremens fell int o the Hudson R iver, he might remember the proverb and c lutch at an imaginary st raw. Words such as \"truth\" are like that straw.

The discovery of radioactivity created a momentary chaos i n chemistry and phys ics; but it soon l ed to a fuller interpretation of the old ideas.

This then is the virtue of the Magick of The Beast 666, a nd the canon of its proper usage: to de stroy the tendency to discriminate between any two things i n theory, and in pr actice to pierce the veils of every sanctuary, pressing f orw ard to embrace every image; for there is none that is not very Isis. The Inmos t is one with the Inmost; yet the form of the One is not the form of the other; intimacy exacts fitness. He therefore who liveth by a ir, let him not be bold to br eathe water.

I t is not necessary at this stage for us to de clare fully the ultimate en d of our researches; nor indeed would it be unde rstood by t hose who ha ve not be come proficient in these elementary courses. 6. The experimenter is encouraged to us e his own intelligence, and not to re 193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"ly upon a ny ot her person or persons, how ever distingui shed, even among our selve s. 7.

The more scientific the record is, the better. Yet the emotions shoul d b e noted, as being s ome of the condi tions. Let then the record be written with sincerity and c are; thus with pr actice i t will be found m ore and m ore to approximate to the ideal. {368}  I I P hysical clairvoya nce. 1. Take a pack of (78) Tarot playing c ards. Shuffle; cut. Draw one card. Without looki ng a t it, try to na me it. Write dow n the card you na me, and the a ctual card. R epeat, and tabulate results. 2. This experiment is probably easier with an old ge nuine pack of Tarot card s, preferably a pack us ed for divination by s ome one who r eally unde rstood t he matter. 3. R emember that one shoul d expect to na me the right card onc e in 78 t imes. Also be careful to exclude all pos sibilities of obtaining the know ledge throug h the ordinary senses of sight and touch, or even smell. There was onc e a man whose fingertips were so sensitive that he could feel t he shape and pos ition of the pips and s o judge the card correctly. 4. I t is better to try first the easier form of the experiment, by gue ssing only the suit. 5. R emember that in 78 e xperiments you s houl d obt ain 22 t rumps and 14 of eac h other suit; so that without any c lairvoya nce at all, you c an gue ss right twic e in 7 t imes (roughl y) by c alling trumps each time. 6. N ote that some cards are harmonious. Thus it would not be a bad error to call the five of Swords (\"The Lord of De feat\") instead of the ten of Swords (\"The Lord of Ruin\"). But to call the Lord of Love (2 Cups) for the Lord of Strife (5 Wands) would show that you w ere get ting not hing r ight. Similarly a card ruled by M ars would be harmonious with a 5, a card of Gemin i with \"The Lovers\". 7. These harmonies must be thoroughl y learnt, according to the num erous tabl es given in 777. 8. As you pr ogress you w ill find that you a re able to distingui sh the suit c orrectly three times in four and that very few indeed inharmonious errors occur , while in 78 e xperiments you a re able to na me the card aright as many a s 15 or 20 t imes. 9.

At rest in one of your pos itions, close the right nos tril with the thum b of the right hand a nd br eathe out slowly and c ompletely {370} t hrough t he left nostril, while your watch marks 20 s econds . Breathe in through t he same nos tri l for 10 s econds . Changing ha nds, repeat with the other nos tril. Let this be continuous for one hour . 2. When this is quite easy to you, i ncrease the periods to 30 a nd 15 s econds . 3. When this is quite easy to you, but not before, breathe out for 15 s econd s, in for 15 s econds , and hol d the breath for 15 s econds . 4. When you c an do t his with pe rfect ease and c omfort for a whole hour , prac tice breathing out for 40 a nd in for 20 s econds . 5. This being a ttained, pr actice breathing out for 20, i n for 10, hol ding th e breath for 30 s econds . When this has become perfectly easy to you, you m ay be admitted for examinat ion, a nd s houl d you pa ss, you w ill be instructed in more complex and di fficult practices. 6. You w ill find that the presence of food i n the stomach, even in small qua ntities, makes the practices very difficult. 7.

The five tatwas are useful for this pur pose; they are: a black ova l; a blue disk; a silver crescent; a yellow square; a red triangle. 2.

P roceed to simple moving obj ects, such as a pendul um swinging, a wheel re volving, e tc. Avoid living obj ects. 4.

The relation be tween the two movements shoul d be varied in different experiments. Or even a system of flywheels, eccentrics, and gove rnor. 5. D uring these practices the mind m ust be absolutely confined to the object determined upon; no ot her thought must be allowed to intrude upon t he consciou sness. The moving s ystems must be regular and ha rmonious. 6.

Av oid ove rstrain; this is very important. 7. P roceed to imagine living obj ects; as a man, pr eferably some man know n to , and r espected by , your self. 8. I n the intervals of these experiments you m ay try to imagine the objects of the other senses, and to concentrate upon t hem. For example, try to imagine the taste of chocolate, the smell of roses, the feeling of velvet, the sound of a waterfall or the ticking of a watch. 9. E ndeavour finally to shut out all objects of any of the senses, and pr eve nt all thought s arising in your mind. When you f eel you ha ve attained some suc cess in these practices, apply for examination, a nd s houl d you pa ss, more compl ex and di fficult practices will be prescribed for you.  VI  P hysical limitations. 1. I t is desirable that you s houl d discover for your self your phys ical limit ations. 2. To this end a scertain for how many hour s you c an subsist without food or drink be fore your working c apacity is seriously interfered with. 3. Ascertain how much alcohol you c an take, and w hat forms of drunke nness as sail you. {372} 4. Ascertain how far you c an walk without onc e stoppi ng; likewise with da nci ng, s wimming, r unni ng, e tc. 5. Ascertain for how many hour s you c an do w ithout sleep. 6. Test your endur ance with va rious gym nastic exercises, club s winging, a nd so on. 7. Ascertain for how long you c an ke ep silence. 8. I nvestigate any ot her capacities and a ptitudes which may oc cur to you. 9. L et all these things be carefully and c onscientiously recorded; for accor ding to your pow ers will it be demanded of you.  VII  A Course of Reading 1. The object of most of the foregoing pr actices will not at first be clear to you; but at least (who w ill deny it?) they ha ve trained you i n de termination , accuracy, introspection, a nd m any ot her qua lities which are valuable to all m en in their ordinary avocations, so that in no c ase will your time have been wa sted. 2. That you m ay ga in some insight into the nature of the Great Work which li es beyond t hese elementary trifles, how ever, we shoul d mention that an intellig ent person m ay ga ther more than a hint of its nature from the following books , which are to be taken as serious and learned contributions to the study of Natu re, though not necessarily to be implicitly relied upon. 196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" \"The Yi King\" (S.B.E.

C areful study of these books will enable the pupi l to speak in the langua ge of his master, and f acilitate communications with him. 4. The pupi l shoul d endeavour to discover the funda mental harmony of these v ery va ried works; for this pur pose he will find it best to study t he most extre me divergencies side by s ide. 5. H e may at any time that he wishes apply for examination in this course of reading. 6.

He must rely entirely upon hi mself, and c redit nothing w hatever but that which lies within his own know ledge and e xperience. 8. As in the beginning, s o at the end, w e here insist upon t he vital importa nce of the written record as the only pos sible check upon e rror derived from th e various qua lities of the experimenter. 9.

I n this book i t is spoke n of the Sephiroth, and the Paths, of Spirits and Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and m any ot her things which may or may not exist. It is immaterial whether they exist or not. By doi ng c ertain things certain results follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing obj ecti ve reality or philosophi c validity to any of them. 3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these: ( a) A widening of the hor izon of the mind. ( b) An improvement of the control of the mind. 4. The student, if he attains any s uccess in the following pr actices, will f ind hi mself confronted by t hings (ideas or beings) too gl orious or too dr eadful to be described. I t is essential that he remain the master of all that he beh olds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion a nd the pr ey of madness. Before entering upon a ny of these practices the student must be in good he al th, and ha ve attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and D harana. 5. There is little danger that any s tudent, how ever idle or stupid, w ill fai l to ge t some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, eve n though i t be by t hose which it is necessary that he shoul d attain. Too of ten , moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place for the goa l, and taketh of f h is armour as if he were a victor ere the fight is well begun. {375} It is desirable that the student shoul d ne ver attach to any r esult the impor tance which it at first seems to pos sess. 6. F irst, then, let us consider the Book \" 777\" and its use; the preparation of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and f inally the methods which fo llow in Chapter V. \"Viator in Regnis Arboris\" and in Chapter VI \"Sagitta trans Lunam.\" (In another book w ill be treated of the Expansion a nd C ontraction of Conscio usness; progress by s laying the Chakkrams; progress by s laying the Pairs of Opp osites; the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, etc., etc.)  I I. 1. The student must first obtain a thorough know ledge of \"Book 777\" , especia lly of the columns printed elsewhere in this Book.> When these are committed to memory, he will begin to unde rstand the nature o f these corresponde nces. (See Illustrations in \"The Temple of Solomon the King \" in Equinox N o. 2. C ross references are given.) 2. I f we take an example, the use of the tables will become clear. Let us suppos e that you w ish to obt ain know ledge of some obs cure science. In column xlv to the > pow er , line 12, you w ill find \" Know ledge of Sciences .\" By now looki ng up l ine 12 i n the other columns, you w ill find that the Plane t correspondi ng is Mercury, its num ber eight, its lineal figures the octagon a n d oc tagram.

You w ould then pr epare your Place of Working a ccordingly. In an or ange c ircle you w ould dr aw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you w ould place eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found i n Cornelius Agrippa and ot her books ) you w ould dr aw in the four colours with such other de vices as your experience may sugge st. 4. And s o on. We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary pr epara 198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"tions; and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books , of w hich the \"Goetia\" is perhaps the best example. These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on t he contrary, the student s houl d do not hing the object of which he doe s not unde rstand; also, if he have a ny c apacity whatever, he will find hi s own crude rituals more effective than th e highly pol ished one s of other people. The general pur pose of all this preparation is as follows: 5. S ince the student is a man surrounde d by m aterial objects, if it be his w ish to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him directly sugge st that idea. Thus, in the ritual quot ed, if his glance fall up on the lights, their num ber sugge sts Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and a gain Mercury is brought to his mind. I n other words the whole magical apparatus an d ritual is a complex system of mnemonics. (The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets o f images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond t o pa rticular l ineal figures, divine names, etc. and a re controlled by t hem. As to the pos sib ility of produc ing r esults external to the mind of the seer (objective in the o rdinary common s ense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.) 6. There are three important practices conne cted with all forms of ceremonia l (and the two M ethods which later we shall describe). These are: (1) Assumption of God-forms. (2) Vibration of Divine Names. (3) Rituals of \"Banishing\" and \" Invoki ng\". These, at least, shoul d be completely mastered be fore the dangerous Methods of Chapter V and VI are attempted>. {377}  I II 1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt shoul d be made thoroughl y familia r. This can be done by s tudyi ng them in any publ ic museum, or in such books as may be accessible to the student. They shoul d then be carefully pa inted by hi m, bot h from the model and f rom memory. 2. The student, seated in the \"God\" pos ition, or in the characteristic attit ude of the God de sired, shoul d then imagine His image as coinciding w ith his ow n body , or as enveloping it. This must be practised unt il mastery of the image is attained, and a n identity with it and w ith the God e xperienced. It is a matter for very gr eat regret that no s imple and c ertain tests of suc cess in this practice exist. 3. The Vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the hum an consciousness with that pur e por tion of it which man calls by t he name of some God, l et him act thus: 4. ( a) Stand w ith arms outstretched>. (See illustration, i n Equinox N o. 2, p. 13> ). (b) Breathe in de eply through t he nos trils, imagining the name of the God de sired entering w ith the breath. (c) Let that name descend s lowly from the lungs to the heart, the solar plex us, the navel, the generative organs, and s o to the feet. (d) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, qui ckly advance the left f oot about 12 i nches, throw forward the body , and let the hands (drawn ba ck to t he side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you a re standing in the typical pos itio n of the God H orus>, and a t the same time imagine the Name as rushing up a nd th rough t he body , while you br eathe it out through t he nos trils with the air whic h ha s been till then retained in the lungs . All this must be done with all the force of which you a re capable. (e) Then withdraw the left foot, and pl ace the right forefinger> {378} upon the lips, so that you a re in the characteristic pos ition of the God H arpocrates . 5.

These rituals shoul d be practised unt il the figures drawn appear in flame 204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":", in flame so ne ar to phys ical flame that it would pe rhaps be visible to the ey es of a bys tander, were one present. It is alleged that some persons have atta ined the pow er of actually kindling f ire by t hese means. Whether this be so or not, the pow er is not one to be aimed at. 3. S uccess in \"banishing\" is know n by a \"feeling of cleanliness\" in the atmo sphere; success in \"invoki ng\" by a \"feeling of holiness\". It is unf ortunate th at these terms are so va gue. But at least make sure of this; that any imaginary figure or being s hall ins tantly obe y the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure. In o bstinate cases, the form of the appropriate God m ay be assumed. {386} 4. The banishing r ituals shoul d be used at the commencement of any c eremony whatever. Next, the student shoul d us e a general invoc ation, s uch as the \"Prel iminary Invoc ation\" in the \"Goetia\" as well as a special invoc ation to suit the nature of his working. 5. S uccess in these verbal invoc ations is so subtle a matter, and its grades so de licately shaded, that it must be left to the good s ense of the student to decide whether or not he shoul d be satisfied with his result.  V. 1. L et the student be at rest in one of his prescribed pos itions, having ba t hed and r obed with the proper decorum. Let the place of working be free from a ll disturbance, and let the preliminary pur ifications, banishings and invoc atio ns be duly accomplished, and, l astly, let the incense be kindled. 2. L et him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical ga rments, and a rmed with the proper magical weapons ) as enveloping hi s phys ical b ody, or standing ne ar to and in front of him. 3. L et him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that imagined figu re; so that it may seem to him that he is seeing w ith its eyes, and he aring w it h its ears. This will usually be the great difficulty of the ope ration. 4. L et him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great hei ght above the earth. 5. L et him then stop a nd look a bout him. (It is sometimes difficult to ope n the eyes.) 6. P robably he will see figures approaching hi m, or become conscious of a la ndscape. Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon be ing a nswered, us ing the pro per pentagrams and s igns, as previously taught . 7. L et him travel at will, either with or without guidance from such figure or figures. 8. L et him further employ s uch special invoc ations as will cause to appear t he particular places he may wish to visit. 9. L et him beware of the thous and s ubtle attacks and de ceptions that he will experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks. {387} Thus a hos tile being m ay appear clothed with glory; the appropriate pentagra m will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay. 10. P ractice will make the student infinitely wary in such matters. 11. It is usually qui te easy to return to the body , but shoul d any di fficult y arise, practice (again) will make the imagination f ertile. For example, one may create in thought a chariot of fire with white hor ses, and c ommand the char ioteer to dr ive earthwards. It might be dangerous to go t oo f ar, or to stay too long; for fatigue must b e avoided. The danger spoke n of is that of fainting, or of obs ession, or of loss of mem ory or other mental faculty. 12. F inally, let the student cause his imagined body i n which he suppos es hi mself to ha ve been travelling to coincide with the phys ical, tightening hi s mus cles, drawing in his breath, and put ting hi s forefinger to his lips. Then let him \"awake\" by a well-defined act of will, and s oberly and a ccurately record hi 205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"s experiences. It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly eas y to pe rform. It is best to learn by \" travelling\" with a person a lready e xperi enced in the matter. Two or three experiments shoul d suffice to render the stu dent confident and e ven expert. See also \"The Seer\", pp. 295- 333, E quinox I , 2 .  VI. 1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of imp ortance. But it is susceptible of a developm ent which merges into a form of Dh arana --- concentration - -- and a s such may lead to the very highest ends. The principal use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the studen t with every kind of obs tacle and e very kind of delusion, s o that he may be per fect master of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transm ute it, to cause it instantly to obe y his will. 2. L et him then be gin exactly as before, but with the most intense solemnity and de termination. 3. L et him be very careful to cause his imaginary body t o rise {388} i n a li ne exactly pe rpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his phys ical body i s situated (or to put it more simply, straight upw ards). 4. I nstead of stoppi ng, l et him continue to rise until fatigue almost ove rco mes him. If he shoul d find that he has stoppe d without willing to do s o, and t hat figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.

E XPLICIT {389}  L IBER ASTARTE  ve l  B ERYLLI  S UB FIGURA CLXXV.> 0. This is the Book of Uniting H imself to a particular Deity by de votion. 1. \" Considerations before the Threshold:\" --- First concerning the choice of a particular Deity. This matter is of no i mport, sobeit that thou c hoos e one suited to thine own highest nature. Howsoever, this method i s not so suitable for gods austere as Saturn, or intellectual as Thoth. B ut for such de ities as in themselves partake in anyw ise of love it is a perfect mode. 2. \" Concerning the prime method of this Magick Art:\" --- Let the devotee con sider well that although C hrist and O siris be one , yet the former is to be wors hipped with Christian, and the latter with Egypt ian, rites. And this, although 206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" the rites themselves are ceremonially equivalent. There shoul d, how ever, be \" one\" symbol declaring the transcending of such limitations; and w ith regard to the Deity also, there shoul d be some \"one\" affirmation of his identity bot h wit h all other similar gods of other nations, and w ith the Supreme of whom all are but partial reflections. 3. \" Concerning the chief place of devotion:\" --- This is the Heart of the De votee, and s houl d be symbolically represented by t hat room or spot which he lov es best. And the dearest spot therein shall be the shrine of his temple. It i s most conve nient if this shrine and a ltar shoul d be sequestered in woods , or i n a private grove, or garden. B ut let it be protected from the profane. 4. \" Concerning the Image of the Deity:\" --- Let there be an image of the Dei ty; first because in meditation there is mindfulness induc ed thereby; and s econ d be cause a certain pow er enters and inhabits it by vi rtue of the ceremonies; o r so it is said, and We deny it not. Let this image be the most beautiful and perfect which the devotee is able to pr ocure; or if he be able to pa int or to c arve the same, it is all the better. As for Deities with whose nature no I mage is compatible, let them be worshipped in an {390} e mpty shrine. Such are Brah ma, and Allah. Also some pos tcaptivity conceptions of Jehova h. 5. \" Further concerning the shrine.\" --- Let this shrine be furnished appropr iately as to its ornaments, according to the book 777. With ivy a nd pi ne-cones , that is to say, for Bacchus, and let lay be fore him both gr apes and w ine. So also for Ceres let there be corn, and c akes; or for Diana moon- wort and pa le h erbs, and pur e water. Further it is well to suppor t the shrine with talismans of the planets, signs and e lements appropriate. But these shoul d be made accor ding to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus by t he light of the book 777 dur i ng the course of his Devotion. I t is also well, nevertheless, if a magick circ le with the right signs and na mes be made beforehand. 6. \" Concerning the Ceremonies:\" --- Let the Philosophus prepare a pow erful I nvoc ation of the particular Deity according to his Ingenium. But let it consis t of these several parts: --- First, an Imprecation, a s of a slave unto his Lord. Second, a n Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege. Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent. Fourth, an Orison, a s of a Priest unto his God. Fifth, a Colloquy , as of a Brother with his Brother. Sixth, a Conjuration, a s to a Friend w ith his Friend. Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress. And m ark well that the first shoul d be of awe, the second of fealty, the thi rd of dependence, the fourth of adoration, t he fifth of confidence, the sixth o f comradeship, the seventh of passion. 7. \" Further concerning the ceremonies.\" --- Let then this Invoc ation be the principal part of an or dered ceremony. And in this ceremony l et the Philosophu s in no w ise neglect the service of a menial. Let him sweep and ga rnish the pl ace, sprinkling it with water or with wine as is appropriate to the particular Deity, and c onsecrating it with oil, and w ith such ritual as may seem him best. And let all be done with intensity and m inuteness. 8. \" Concerning the period of devotion, a nd the hour s thereof:\" --- Let a fi xed pe riod be set for the worship; and it is said that the least time is nine d ays by s even, and the greatest seven ye ars by ni ne. And c oncerning the hour s, let the Ceremony be performed {391} e very da y thrice, or at least onc e, and let the sleep of the Philosophus be broken for some pur pose of devotion a t least o nce in every night. Now to some it may seem best to appoi nt fixed hour s for the ceremony. To ot hers it may seem that the ceremony s houl d be performed as the spirit moves them so to do; for this there is no r ule. 9. \" Concerning the Robes and I nstruments:\" --- The Wand a nd C up a re to be c hosen for this Art; never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle, unl ess that Pantacle chance to be of a nature harmonious. But even so it is best to ke ep t o the Wand a nd the Cup, a nd if one must choos e, the Cup. For the Robes, that of a Philosophus , or that of an Adept Within is most sui 207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"table; or the robe best fitted for the service of the particular Deity, as a ba ssara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta. So also for Vesta, one might use fo r instrument the Lamp; or the sickle, for Chronos . 10. \" Concerning the Incense and L ibations.\" --- The incense shoul d follow t he nature of the particular Deity, as, mastic for Mercury, dittany f or Persepho ne. Also the libations, as, a decoction of nightshade for Melancholia, or of I ndian he mp for Uranus. 11. \"Concerning the harmony of the ceremonies:\" --- Let all these things be rightly considered, and a t length, in langua ge of the utmost beauty at the comm and of the Philosophus , accompanied, if he has skill, by m usic, and interwoven, if the particular Deity be jocund, w ith da ncing. And a ll being c arefully pr ep ared and r ehearsed let it be practised da ily unt il it be wholly rhythmical with his aspirations, and a s it were, a part of his being. 12. \" Concerning the variety of the ceremonies.\" --- Now, seeing that every m an differeth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence he is identica l, let also these ceremonies assert their identity by t heir diversity. For thi s reason do w e leave much he rein to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus . 13. \" Concerning the life of the devotee.\" --- First let his way of life be s uch as is pleasing to the particular Deity. Thus to invoke Neptune, let him go a-fishing; but if Hades, let him not approach the water that is hateful to Him . {392} 14. \" Further, concerning the life of the devotee:\" --- Let him cut away from his life any a ct, word or thought , that is hateful to the particular Deity; as , unc hastity in the case of Artemis, evasions in the case of Ares. Besides thi s, he shoul d avoid all harshness or unki ndne ss of any ki nd in thought , word, or deed, seeing that above the particular Deity is One in whom all is One. Yet a lso he may de liberately pr actise cruelties, where the particular Deity manifest s His Love in that manner, as in the case of Kali, and of Pan. And therefore, before the beginning of his periods of devotion, l et him practise according to the rules of Liber Jugor um. 15. \" Further concerning the life of the devotee:\" --- Now, as many a re fully occupied with their affairs, let it be know n that this method i s adaptable to the necessities of all. And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux a nd Q uintessence o f the whole Method. First, if he have no I mage, let him take anything s oever, and c onsecrate it as an Image of his God. L ikewise with his robes and instruments, his suffumiga tions and libations; for his Robe hath he not a nightdress; for his instrument a walking s tick; for his suffumigation a bur ning m atch; for his libation a glas s of water? But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of that parti cular Deity, and not profane the same to any ot her use. 16. \" Continuation.\" --- Next, concerning hi s time if it be short. Let him l abour mentally with his Invoc ation, c oncentrating it, and let him perform this Invoc ation in his heart whenever he hath the leisure. And let him seize eagerl y upon e very oppor tunity for this. 17. \" Continuation.\" --- Third, even if he have leisure and pr eparation, l et him seek ever to br ing inward the symbols, so that even in his well ordered shr ine the whole ceremony r evolve inwardly in his heart, that is to say in the tem ple of his body , of which the outer temple is but an image. For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no I mage therein; and the breat h of man is the incense and the libation. 18. \" Continuation.\" --- Further concerning oc cupation. L et the devotee tran smute within the alembic of his heart every thought , or word, or act into the s piritual gold of his devotion. {393} As thus: eating. L et him say, \"I eat this food i n gr atitude to my Deity tha t hath sent it to me, in or der to ga in strength for my de votion to Him.\" Or: sleeping. L et him say, \"I lie dow n to sleep, gi ving thanks for this ble ssing f rom my Deity, in or der that I may be refreshed for new devotion to Him.\" Or: reading. L et him say: \"I read this book t hat I may study t he nature of 208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"my Deity, that further know ledge of Him may inspire me with de eper devotion to Him.\" Or: working. L et him say: \"I drive my spade into the earth that fresh flowe rs (fruit, or what not) may spring up t o His glory, and that I, pur ified by t oi l, may give better devotion to Him.\" Or: whatever it may be that he is doing, l et him reason it out in his mind> , drawing it through c ircumstance and c ircumstance to that one end a nd c onclusio n of the matter. And let him not perform the act until he hath done this. As it is written: Liber VII, Cap. 5. - -- 22. \" Every br eath, every word, every thought is an act of love w ith thee. 23. \" The beat of my he art is the pendul um of love. 24. \" The songs of me are the soft sighs. 25. \" The thought s of me are very rapture. 26. \" And m y de eds are the myriads of Thy C hildren, the stars a nd the atoms.\" And R emember Well, that if thou w ert in truth a lover, all this wouldst thou do of thine own na ture without the slightest flaw or failure in the minutest p art thereof. 19. \" Concerning the Lections.\" --- Let the Philosophus read solely in his co pies of the holy books of Thelema, dur ing the whole period of his devotion. B u t if he weary, then let him read books which ha ve no pa rt whatever in love, as for recreation. But let him copy out each ve rse of Thelema which be ars upon t his matter, and ponde r them, and c omment thereupon. F or therein is a wisdom and a magick too deep to utter in any ot her wise. 20. \" Concerning the Meditations.\" --- Herein is the most potent method of at taining unt o the End, f or him who is thoroughl y pr epared, be ing pur ified by t he practice of the Transmutation of {394} de ed into de votion, a nd c onsecrated by the right performance of the holy ceremonies. Yet herein is danger, for that t he Mind is fluid as quicksilver, and bor dereth upon t he Abyss, and is beset by many s irens and de vils that seduce and a ttack it to de stroy it. Therefore let the devotee beware, and pr ecise accurately his meditations, even as a man shoul d bui ld a canal from sea to sea. 21. \" Continuation.\" --- Let then the Philosophus meditate upon a ll love that hath ever stirred him. There is the love of David and of Jonathan, and the lo ve of Abraham and I saac, and the love of Lear and C ordelia, and the love of Dam on a nd P ythias, and the love of Sappho a nd Atthis, and the love of Romeo and J u liet, and the love of Dante and B eatrice, and the love of Paolo and F rancesca, and the love of Caesar and L ucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and N icole tte, and the love of Daphni s and C hloe, and the love of Cornelia and C aius Grac chus, and the love of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of Cupid and P syche, an d the love of Endym ion a nd Artemis, and the love of Demeter and P ersephone , and the love of Venus and Adoni s, and the love of Lakshmi and Vishnu, a nd the love of Siva and B havani and the love of Buddha and Ananda, and the love of Jesus a nd J ohn, a nd m any m ore. Also there is the love of many s aints for their particular deity, as of St. Francis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for Maheswara, of Abdul la h Haji Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatius Loyol a for Mary, and m any m ore. Now do t hou t ake one such story every night, and e nact it in thy m ind, gr asp ing e ach identity with infinite care and z est, and do t hou f igure thyself as on e of the lovers and thy D eity as the other. Thus do t hou pa ss through a ll adve ntures of love, not omitting one ; and to each do t hou c onclude: How pale a refl ection is this of my love for this Deity! Yet from each shalt thou dr aw some know ledge of love, some intimacy with lov e, that shall aid thee to pe rfect thy love. Thus learn the hum ility of love fr om one , its obe dience from another, its intensity from a third, its pur ity from a fourth, its peace from yet a fifth. So then thy love being m ade perfect, it shall be worthy of that perfect love of His. {395} 209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":" 22. \" Further concerning m editation.\" --- Moreover let the Philosophus imagin e to himself that he hath indeed succeeded in his devotion, a nd that his Lord h ath appeared to him, and that they conve rse as may be fitting. 23. \" Concerning the Mysterious Triangle.\" --- Now as >three cords separately may be broken by a child, w hile those same cords duly twisted may bind a giant , let the Philosophus learn to entwine these three methods of Magick into a Spe ll. To this end let him unde rstand that as they are One, because the end is One, so are they One because the method i s One, even the method of turning the mind toward the particular Deity by l ove in every act. And lest thy twine slip, he re is a little cord that wrappeth tightly round a nd r ound a ll, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer. 24. \" Concerning the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.\" --- Let the Philosophus w eave the Name of the particular Deity into a sentence short and r hythmical, as, for Artemis: GR:epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu, G R:epsilon-pi-ep silon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu, G R:Alpha-rho-tau-epsilon-mu-iota-sigma; or, for Shiva: Namo Shivaya namaha Aum; or, for Mary; Ave Maria; or for Pan, GR:Chi-alpha-iota-rho-epsilon G R:Sigma-omega-tau-eta-rho G R:Kappa-omicron-si gma-mu-omicron-upsilon, G R:Iota-omega GR:Pi-alpha-nu, G R:Iota-omega GR:Pi-a lpha-nu; or, for Allah, H ua Allahu a lazi lailaha illa Hua. Let him repeat this day and ni ght without cessation m echanically in his brai n, w hich is thus made ready f or the advent of that Lord, and a rmed against all other. 25. \" Concerning the Active and the Passive.\" --- Let the Philosophus change from the active love of his particular deity to a state of passive waiting, e ve n almost a repulsion, t he repulsion not of distaste, but of sublime modesty. As it is written, L iber LXV. ii. 59, \" I have called unt o thee, and I have jo urneyed with thee>, and it availed me not.\" 60. \" I waited pa tiently, and Thou w ast with me from the beginning.\" Then let him change back to the Active, unt il a veritable rhythm is establis hed be tween the states, as it were the swinging of a pendul um. But let him ref lect that a vast intelligence is required for this; for he must stand a s it wer e almost without himself to watch those pha ses of himself, And to do t his is an high Art, and pe rtaineth not altogether to the grade of Philosophus . Neither is it of itself helpful, but rather the reverse in this especial practice. {39 6} 26. \" Concerning s ilence.\" --- Now there may come a time in the course of thi s practice when the outward symbols of devotion c ease, when the soul is as it w ere dum b in the presence of its God. M ark that this is not a cessation but a t ransmutation of the barren seed of prayer into the green shoot of yearning. Th is yearning is spont aneous, and it shall be left to gr ow, whether it be sweet o r bitter. For often times it is as the torment of hell in which the soul bur ns and w rithes unc easingly. Yet it ends, and a t its end c ontinue ope nly thy M eth od. 27. \" Concerning D ryness.\" --- Another state wherein at times the soul may fa ll is this dark night. And this is indeed pur ifying, i n such de pths that the s oul cannot fathom it. It is less like pain than like death. B ut it is the nec essary de ath that comes before the rising of a body gl orified. This state must be endur ed with fortitude; and no m eans of alleviating it ma y be employed. I t may be broken up by t he breaking up of the whole Method, a nd a return to the world without . This cowardice not only de stroys the value of all that has gone before, but destroys the value of the Oath of Fealty that tho u ha st sworn, and m akes thy Will a mockery to men and gods . 28. \" Concerning the Deceptions of the Devil.\" --- Note well that in this sta te of dryness a thous and s eductions will lure thee away; also a thous and m eans of breaking thine oath in spirit without breaking it in letter. Against this t hou m ayst repeat the words of thine oath aloud a gain and a gain unt il the tempta tion be ove rcome. Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much be tter for this ope r ation that thou do t hus and thus, and s eek to affright thee by f ears for thy he 210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"alth or thy r eason. Or he may send a gainst thee visions worse than madness. Against all this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine Oath. S o then thou s halt go t hrough c eremonies meaningless and hi deous to thee, and bl as pheme shalt thou a gainst thy D eity and c urse Him. And this mattereth little, f or it is not thou, s o be that thou a dhere to the Letter of thine Obligation. F or thy S piritual Sight is closed, and to trust it is to be led into> the precip ice, and hur led therefrom. 29. \" Further of this matter.\" --- Now also subtler than all these {397} t err ors are the Illusions of Success. But one instant's> self-satisfaction or Expa nsion of thy S pirit, especially in this state of dryness, and thou a rt lost. F or thou m ayst attain the False Union w ith the Demon hi mself. Beware also of e ven the pride which rises from having r esisted the temptations. But so many a nd s o subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole world co uld not contain their enum eration. The answer to one and a ll is the persistence in the literal fulfilment of th e routine. Beware, then, last, of that devil who s hall whisper in thine ear th at the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life, and a nswer: Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, a nd di e, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bring eth forth much fruit. Yet shalt thou a lso be ware of disputation w ith the devil and pr ide in the cl everness of thine answers to him. Therefore, if thou ha st not lost the pow er o f silence, let it be first and last employed against him. 30. \" Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart.\" --- Now learn that thy m ethods are dry, one and a ll. Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they are not Lo ve. Yet as a man, rubbi ng two dr y sticks together for long, s udde nly found a s park, so also from time to time will true Love leap una sked into thy m ediation. Yet this shall die and be reborn again and a gain. I t may be that thou ha st n o tinder near. In the end s hall come sudde nly a great flame and de vour ing, a nd bur n thee ut terly. Now of these sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of these beginn ings of the Infinite Fire, thou s halt thus be aware. For the sparks thy he art shall leap up, a nd thy c eremony or meditation or toil shall seem of a sudde n to go of its own will; and f or the little flames this shall be increased in vol um e and intensity; and f or the beginnings of the Infinite Fire thy c eremony s hall be caught up unt o ravishing s ong, a nd thy m editation s hall be ecstasy, and thy toil shall be a delight exceeding a ll pleasure thou ha st ever know n. And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoke n; for therein is the End of this Magick Art of Devotion. 31. \" Considerations with regard to the use of symbols.\" It is to {398} be n oted that persons of pow erful imagination, w ill, and intelligence have no ne ed of these material symbols. There have been certain saints who a re capable of l ove for an idea as such without it being ot herwise than de graded by \" idolising\" it, to us e this word in its true sense. Thus one may be impassioned of beauty , without even the need of so small a concretion of it as \"The beauty of Apollo \", the \"beauty of roses\", the \"beauty of Attis\". Such pe rsons are rare; it may be doubt ed whether Plato himself attained to any vi sion of absolute beauty with out attaching to it material objects in the first place. A second c lass is abl e to contemplate ideals through t his veil; a third class need a doubl e veil, an d cannot think of the beauty of a rose without a rose before them. For such, i s this Method of most use; yet let them know that there is this danger therein, that they may mistake the gross body of the symbol for the idea made concrete thereby. 32. \" Considerations of further danger to those not pur ged of material though t.\" --- Let it be remembered that in the nature of the love itself is danger. The lust of the satyr for the nym ph is indeed of the same nature as the affinit y of quicklime for water on t he one hand, a nd of love of Ab for Ama on t he othe r; so also is the triad Osiris, Isis, Horus like that of a hor se, mare, foal, a nd of red, bl ue, pur ple. And this is the founda tion of Corresponde nces. 211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" But it were false to say \"Horus is a foal\" or \"Horus is pur ple\". One may sa y: \"Horus resembles a foal in this respect that he is the offspring of two comp lementary be ings\". 33. \" Further of this matter.\" --- So also many ha ve said truly that since ea rth is that One,> and oc ean is that One, therefore earth is ocean. U nto Him go od is illusion, a nd e vil is illusion; therefore good i s evil. By this fallacy of logic are many m en de stroyed. M oreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who s houl d say, my he art is in Tiphereth, an Adeptus is in Tiphereth; I am therefore an adept. And in this practice the worst danger is this, that the love which is its we apon s houl d fail in one of two ways. First, if the love lack any qua lity of love, so long i s it not ideal love. For it is written of the Perfected One: \"There is no m ember of my body w hich is not the member of some god.\" Therefore {399} l et not the Philosophus despise any f orm of love, but harmonise all. As it is written: Liber LXV, 32. \" So the refore Perfection a bideth not in the Pinnacles or in the Founda tion, but in the harmony of One with all.\" Second, i f any pa rt of this love exceed, there is disease therein. As, in t he love of Othello for Desdemona, love's jealousy ove rcame love's tenderness, s o may it be in this love of a particular Deity. And this is more likely, since in this divine love no e lement may be omitted. It is by vi rtue of this completeness that no hum an love may in any w ay attai n to more than to foreshadow a little part thereof. 34. \" Concerning M ortifications.\" --- These are not necessary to this method. On the contrary, they may de stroy the concentration, a s count er-irritants to, and s o alleviations of, the supreme mortification w hich is the Absence of the Deity invoke d. Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in things na turally pa inful, this perversion s houl d be endur ed and a llowed to take its cour se. Yet not to the interference with na tural bodi ly he alth, w hereby the instru ment of the soul might be impaired. And c oncerning s acrifices for love's sake, they are natural to this Method, and r ight. B ut concerning vol untary pr ivations and tortures, without use save as again st the devotee, they are generally not natural to he althy na tures, and w rong. For they are selfish. To scourge one 's self serves not one 's master; yet to de ny one 's self bread that one 's child may ha ve cake is the act of a true mother. 35. \" Further concerning M ortifications.\" --- If thy body , on w hich thou r ide st, be so disobedient a beast that by no m eans will he travel in the desired di rection, or if thy m ind be baulkish and e loque nt as Balaam's fabled Ass, then l et the practice be abandone d. L et the shrine be covered in sackcloth, and do t hou put on ha bits of lamentation, a nd a bide alone. And do t hou r eturn most aus terely to the practice of Liber Jugor um, testing thyself by a standard higher t han that hitherto accomplished, and puni shing e ffractions with a heavier goa d. Nor do t hou r eturn to thy de votion unt il {400} t hat body a nd m ind a re tamed an d trained to all manner of peaceable going. 36. \" Concerning m inor adjuvant in the ceremonies.\" --- I. \"Rising on t he pla nes.\" --- By this method m ayst thou a ssist the imagination a t the time of concl uding thine Invoc ation. Act as taught in Liber O, by t he light of Liber 777. 37. \" Concerning m inor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies.\" --- II. \"Talisman ic Magic.\" --- Having m ade by t hine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to represen t the particular Deity, and c onsecrated it with infinite love and c are, do t hou bur n it ceremonially be fore the shrine, as if thereby gi ving up t he shadow for the substance. But it is useless to do t his unless thou do r eally in thine he art value the talisman be yond a ll else that thou ha st. 38. \" Concerning m inor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies.\" --- III. \"Rehears al.\" --- It may assist if the traditional history of the particular Deity be re hearsed be fore him; perhaps this is best done in dr amatic form. This method i s the main one recommended in the \"Exercitios Espirituales\" of St. Ignatius, who se work may be taken as a model. Let the Philosophus work out the legend of hi 212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"s own pa rticular Deity, and a ppor tioning da ys to events, live that life in imag ination, e xercising the five senses in turn, as occasion a rises. 39. \" Concerning m inor matters adjuvant in the ceremonies.\" --- IV. \"Duresse. \" --- This method c onsists in cursing a deity recalcitrant; as, threatening c er emonially \"to bur n the blood of Osiris, and to gr ind dow n his bone s to pow er.\" This method i s altogether contrary to the spirit of love unless the particular Deity be himself savage and r elentless; as Jehova h or Kali. In such a case th e desire to pe rform constraint and c ursing m ay be the sign of the assimilation of the spirit of the devotee with that of his God, a nd s o an advance to the Uni on w ith HIm. 40. \" Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi:\" --- All Samadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of a subject and obj ect in conscio usness, with the result that a third thing a rises which pa rtakes in no w ay of t he nature of the two. It would seem at first sight that it is of no i mportance whatever to choos e an obj ect of meditation. F or example, the Samadhi {401} c alled Atmadarshana mi ght arise from simple concentration of the thought on a n imagined triangle or o n the heart. But as the union of two bodi es in chemistry may be endot hermic or exothermic , the combination of Oxyge n with Nitrogen is gentle, while that of Oxyge n with Hydrogen is explosive; and a s it is found t hat the most heat is disengaged as a rule by t he union of bodi es most oppos ite in character, and that the compound resulting f rom such is most stable, so it seems reasonable to sugge st that the most important and e ndur ing S amadhi results from the contemplation of the Objec t most oppos ite to the devotee. >On other planes, it has been sugge sted that the most oppos ed types make the best marriages and pr oduc e the healthiest children. The greatest pictures and ope ras are those in which violent extremes are blended, and s o ge nerally in ev ery field of activity. Even in mathematics, the greatest parallelogram is form ed if the lines composing it are set at right angles. 41. \" Conclusions from the foregoing.\" --- It may then be sugge sted to the Ph ilosophus , that although hi s work will be harder his reward will be greater if he choos e a Deity most remote from his own na ture. This method i s harder and h igher than that of Liber E. For a simple object as there sugge sted is of the s ame nature as the commonest things of life, while even the meanest Deity is bey ond uni nitiated hum an unde rstanding. O n the same plane, too, Venus is nearer t o man than Aphrodite, Aphrodite than Isis, Isis than Babalon, B abalon than Nuit . Let him decide therefore according to his discretion on t he one hand a nd hi s aspiration on t he other; and let not one ove rrun> his fellow. 42. \" Further concerning the value of this Method.\" --- Certain obj ections ar ise. Firstly, in the nature of all hum an love is illusion, a nd a certain blind ness. Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the Abyss. For this reason we give this method t o the Philosophus , as the reflection of the Exempt Adept, who r eflects the Magister Templi and the Magus. Let then the Philosophus atta in this Method a s a founda tion of the higher Methods to be given to him when he attains those higher grades. {402} Another objection lies in the partiality of this Method. This is equally a defect characteristic of the Grade. 43. \" Concerning a notable danger of Success.\" --- It may oc cur that owing to the tremendous pow er of the Samadhi, ove rcoming a ll other memories as it shoul d and doe s do, t hat the mind of the devotee may be obs essed, so that he declare his particular Deity to be sole God a nd L ord. This error has been the founda t ion of all dogm atic religions, and s o the cause of more misery than all other e rrors combined. The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature of the Method he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time believe in his particul ar Deity. But let him (1) consider that this belief is only a weapon i n his ha nds, and ( 2) affirm sufficiently that his Deity is but an emanation or reflecti on or eidolon of a Being be yond hi m, as was said in Paragraph 2. F or if he fai 213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"l herein, since man cannot remain pe rmanently in Samadhi, the memorised Image i n his mind w ill be degraded, and r eplaced by t he correspondi ng D emon, t o his ut ter ruin. Therefore, after Success, let him not delight ove rmuch in his Deity, but rat her bus y himself with his other work, not permitting that which is but a step t o be come a goa l. As it is written, L iber CLXXXV: \"remembering that Philosophy is the Equilibrium of him that is in the House of Love.\" 44. \" Concerning the secrecy and the rites of Blood.\" --- During this practic e it is most wise that the Philosophus utter no w ord concerning hi s working, a s if it were a Forbidden Love that consumeth him. But let him answer fools acco rding to their folly; for since he cannot conceal his love from his fellows, he must speak to them as they may unde rstand. And a s many D eities demand s acrifice, one of men, another of cattle, a third of dove s, let these sacrifices be replaced by t he true sacrifices in thine own heart. Yet if thou m ust symbolise them outwardly for the hardness of thine he art, let thine own blood a nd no ot her's be spilt before that altar.> {403} Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and m ay cause the manifestation of evil things, hos tile and m alicious, to thy gr eat hur t. 45. \" Concerning a further sacrifice.\" --- Of this it shall be unde rstood t ha t nothing is to be spoke n; nor need anything be spoke n to him that hath wisdom to comprehend the num ber of the paragraph. And this sacrifice is fatal beyond all, unl ess it be a \"sacrificium\" indeed.> Yet there are those who ha ve dared and a chieved thereby. 46. \" Concerning ye t a further sacrifice.\" --- Here it is spoke n of actual mu tilation. S uch acts are abom inable; and w hile they may br ing s uccess in this M ethod, f orm an absolute bar to all further progress. And they are in any c ase more likely to lead to madness than to Samadhi. He indeed who pur poseth them is already m ad. 47. \" Concerning hum an affection.\" --- During this practice thou s halt in no wise withdraw thyself from hum an relations, onl y figuring to thyself that thy f ather or thy br other or thy w ife is as it were an image of thy pa rticular Deity . Thus shall they ga in, and not lose, by t hy w orking. O nly in the case of thy wife this is difficult, since she is more to thee than all others, and in this case thou m ayst act with temperance, lest her personality ove rcome and de stroy that of thy D eity. 48. \" Concerning the Holy Guardian Angel.\" --- Do thou i n no w ise confuse thi s invoc ation w ith that. 49. \" The Benediction.\" --- And s o may the love that passeth all Understandin g ke ep your hearts and m inds through G R:Iota-Alpha-Omega GR:Alpha-Delta-Omicr on-Nu-Alpha-Iota GR:Sigma-Alpha-Beta-Alpha-Omega and through B ABALON of the Ci ty of the Pyramids, and through Astarte, the Starry One green-girdled, in the n ame ARARITA.

Further, l et the Zelator accomplished in those practices endeavour to master a cycle of 1 0, 20, 40 or even 16, 32, 64. B ut let this be done gradually and w ith due caut ion. And w hen he is steady a nd e asy bot h in Asana and P ranayama, let him still further increase the period. Thus let him investigate these statements which follow: --- (a) If Pranayama be properly pe rformed, the body w ill first of all become co vered with sweat. This sweat is different in character from that customarily i nduc ed by e xertion. I f the Practitioner rub this sweat thoroughl y into his bod y, he will greatly strengthen it. {405} (b) The tendency to pe rspiration w ill stop a s the practice is continued, and the body be come automatically rigid. Describe this rigidity with minute accuracy. (c) The state of automatic rigidity will develop into a state characterised by vi olent spasmodic movements of which the Practitioner is unc onscious, but of whose result he is aware. This result is that the body hops gently from place to place. After the first two or three occurrences of this experience, Asana is not lost. The body a ppears (on a nother theory) to ha ve lost its weight almo st completely and to be moved by a n unknow n force. (d) As a developm ent of this stage, the body r ises into the air, and r emains there for an appreciably long pe riod, f rom a second t o an hour or more. Let him further investigate any m ental results which may oc cur. 6. \" Third Practice.\" --- In or der both to econom ise his time and to de velop his pow ers, let the Zelator practise the deep full breathing w hich his prelimin ary exercises will have taught him dur ing hi s walks. Let him repeat a sacred s entence (mantra) or let him count , in such a way that his footfall beats accura tely with the rhythm thereof, as is done in da ncing. Then let him practise Pra nayama, at first without the Kumbhakam>, and pa ying no a ttention to the nos tril s otherwise than to ke ep them clear. Let him begin by a n indrawing of the brea th for 4 pa ces, and a breathing out for 4 pa ces. Let him increase this gradual ly to 6.6, 8.8, 12.12, 16.16 a nd 24.24, or more if he be able.

For the dance as such it is better to us e a mantra of a non- co mmittal character, such as GR:Tau-omicron G R:epsilon-iota-nu-alpha-iota, GR: Tau-omicron G R:Kappa-alpha-lambda-omicron-nu, G R:Tau-omicron 'G R:Alpha-gamma- alpha-delta-omicron-nu,> or the like. {406} 8. \" Fifth pr actice.\" --- Let him practice mental concentration dur ing the da nce, and investigate the following e xperiments: (a) The dance becomes independent of the will.

Ten minutes of such pr actice is ample to induc e profuse sweating in any pl ac e of a temperature of 17 D egree C or ove r.

L et him gradually in crease the period of this Kumbhakam as in the case of the other. 14. A note concerning the condi tions of these experiments. The condi tions favour able are dry, bracing a ir, a warm climate, absence of w ind, a bsence of noise, insects and a ll other disturbing influences,> a retired situation, s imple food e aten in gr eat moderation a t the conclusion of the pract ices of morning a nd a fternoon, a nd on no a ccount before practising.

L et the Hermit be seated in his Asana, robed, and let him meditate in tur n upon e very several part of his body unt il that part is so unr eal to him that he no l onge r includes it in his comprehension of himself. For example if it be his right foot, let him touch that foot, and be alarmed, thinking, \" A foot! .. . foot! What is this foot? Surely I am not alone in the Hermitage!\" And this practice shoul d be carried out not only at the time of meditation, but dur ing the day's work. 2. This meditation is to be assisted by r easoning; as \"This foot is not I. If I shoul d lose my foot, I shoul d still be I. This foot is a mass of changing and de caying f lesh, bone , skin, bl ood, {41 1} lymph, e tc. while I am the Unchan ging a nd I mmortal Spirit, uni form, not made, unbe gotten, formless, self-luminou s,\" etc. 3. This practice being pe rfect for each pa rt of the body , let him combine hi s workings until the whole body i s thus unde rstood a s the non- Ego a nd a s illusi on. 4. L et then the Hermit, seated in his Asana, meditate upon t he Muladhara Cak kra and its corresponde nce as a pow er of the mind, a nd de stroy it in the same m anner as aforesaid. Also by r easoning: \"This emotion ( memory, imagination, i nt ellect, will, as it may be ) is not I. This emotion is transient: I am immovabl e. This emotion is passion. I am peace\", and s o on. Let the other Cakkras in their turn be thus destroyed, each one with its men tal or moral attribute. 5. I n this let him be aided by hi s own ps ychological analysis, so that no pa rt of his conscious being be thus left unde stroyed. And on hi s thoroughne ss in this matter may turn his success. 6. L astly, having dr awn all his being into the highest Sahasrara Cakkra, let him remain eternally fixed in meditation thereupon. 7. AUM.  THIRD METHOD. 1. L et the Hermit stimulate each of the senses in turn, concentrating upon e ach unt il it ceases to stimulate. (The senses of sight and touch are extremely difficult to conque r. In the e nd the Hermit must be utterly una ble by a ny e ffort to see or feel the object of those senses, O.M.) 2. This being pe rfected, let him combine them two at a time. For example, let him chew ginger (taste and touch), and w atch a waterfall (s ight and he aring) and w atch incense (sight and s mell) and c rush sugar in his te eth (taste and he aring) and s o on. 3. These twenty-five practices being a ccomplished, let him combine them thre e at a time, then four at a time. 4. L astly, let him combine all the senses in a single object. And he rein may a sixth sense be included. H e is then to withdraw himself en tirely from all the stimulations, \"perinde ac cadaver,\" in spite of his own eff orts to attach himself to them. {412} 5. B y this method i t is said that the demons of the Ruach, that is, thought s and m emories, are inhibited, and We deny it not. But if so be that they arise , let him build a wall between himself and them according to the method. 6. Thus having s tilled the voices of the Six, m ay he obtain in sense the sub tlety of the Seventh. 7. G R:Alpha-Upsilon-Mu-Gamma-Nu.

He worked out the method hi mself, and w e think it may pr ove useful to many. O.M.) (1) The beginner must first practise breathing r egularly through t he nos e, a t the same time trying ha rd to be lieve that the breath goe s to the Ajna and not to the lungs . The Pranayama exercises described in the Equinox Vol. I, No. 4, p. 101 m ust next be practised, always with the idea that Ajna is breathing. Try to realise that \"pow er,\" not air, is being dr awn into the Ajna, is being concentrated there dur ing K umbhakam, and is vivifying the Ajna dur ing e xpirati on. Try rather to increase the force of concentration in Ajna than to increase so excessively the length of Kumbhakam as this is dangerous if rashly unde rtak en. (2) Walk slowly in a quiet place; realise that the legs are moving, a nd s tud y their movements. Understand thoroughl y that these movements are due to ne rve messages sent dow n from the brain, and that the controlling pow er lies in the Ajna. The legs are automatic, like those of a woode n monke y: the pow er in Ajna is that which doe s the work, is that which walks. This is not hard to realise , and s houl d be grasped firmly, ignor ing a ll other walking s ensations. Apply this method t o every other muscular movement. (3) Lie flat on t he back with the feet unde r a heavy pi ece of furniture. Ke eping the spine straight and the arms in a line with the body , rise slowly to a sitting pos ture, by m eans of the force residing in the Ajna (i.e. try to pr eve nt the mind dw elling one any ot her exertion or sensation.) Then let the body s lowly dow n to its original pos ition. R epeat {413} t his t wo or three times, every night and m orning, a nd s lowly increase the num ber of r epetitions. (4) Try to transfer all bodi ly sensations to the Ajna, e.g., \" I am cold\" sho uld mean \"I feel cold\", or better still, \"I am aware of a sensation of cold\" -- - transfer this to the Ajna, \"the Ajna is aware\", etc. (5) Pain if very slight may easily be transferred to the Ajna after a little practice. The best method f or beginner is to imagine he has a pain in the bod y and then imagine that it passes directly into the Ajna. It doe s not pass thr ough t he intervening s tructures, but goe s direct. After continual practice eve n severe pain may be transferred to the Ajna. (6) Fix the mind on t he base of the spine and then gr adually move the though ts upw ards to the Ajna. (In this meditation Ajna is the Holy of Holies, but it is dark and e mpty.) Finally, strive hard to dr ive anger and ot her obs essing thought s into the Aj na. Try to de velop a tendency to think ha rd of Ajna when these thought s attack the mind, a nd let Ajna conque r them. Beware of thinking of My\" Ajna\". In these meditations and pr actices, Ajna d oes not belong t o you; Ajna is the master and w orker, you a re the woode n monke y . {414}  L IBER HB:Taw-Yod-Shin-Aleph-Resh-Bet  ve l THISHARB  S UB FIGURA CMXIII.> 000.

This book i s not intended to lead to the supreme attainment. On the cont rary, its results define the separate being of the Exempt Adept from the rest o f the Universe, and di scover his relation to the Universe.> 1. I t is of such importance to the Exempt Adept that We cannot ove rrate it. 219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" Let him in no w ise adventure the plunge into the Abyss until he has accomplish ed this to his most perfect satisfaction.> 2. F or in the Abyss no e ffort is anyw ise pos sible. The Abyss is passed by v irtue of the mass of the Adept and hi s Karma. Two forces impel him: (1) the at traction of Binah, (2) the impulse of his Karma; and the ease and e ven the safe ty of his passage depend on t he strength and di rection of the latter.> 3. S houl d one rashly da re the passage, and take the irrevocable Oath of the Abyss, he might be lost therein through Aeons of incalculable agony; he might e ven be thrown ba ck upon C hesed, w ith the terrible Karma of failure added to his original imperfection. 4. I t is even said that in certain circumstances it is pos sible to {415} f al l altogether from the Tree of Life and to attain the Towers of the Black Brothe rs. But We hold that this is not pos sible for any a dept who ha s truly attained his grade, or even for any m an who ha s really sought to he lp hum anity even for a single second> , and that although hi s aspiration ha ve been impure through va nity or any s imilar imperfections. 5. L et then the Adept who f inds the result of these meditations uns atisfacto ry refuse the Oath of the Abyss, and live so that his Karma gains strength and direction s uitable to the task at some future period.> 6. M emory is essential to the individual consciousness; otherwise the mind w ere but a blank s heet on w hich shadow s are cast. But we see that not only doe s the mind r etain impressions, but that it is so constituted that its tendency i s to retain some more excellently than others. Thus the great classical schola r, Sir Richard Jebb, w as una ble to learn even the school boy m athematics require d for the preliminary examination a t Cambridge University, and a special Grace> of the authorities was required in or der to admit him. 7. The first method t o be described ha s been de tailed in Bhikkhu Ananda Mett eya's \"Training of the Mind\" (Equinox I , 5, pp. 28- 59, a nd e specially pp. 48- 57 ). We have little to alter or to add. I ts most important result as regards th e Oath of the Abyss, is the freedom from all desire or clinging to anything w hi ch it gives. Its second r esult is to aid the adept in the second m ethod, by s u pplying hi m with further data for his investigation.> 8. The stimulation of memory us eful in bot h pr actices is also achieved by s i mple meditation ( Liber E), in a certain stage of which old memories arise unbi d den. The adept may then pr actise this, stoppi ng a t this stage, and e ncouraging instead of suppr essing the flashes of memory. 9. Z oroaster has said, \"Explore the River of the Soul, whence {416} or in wh at order you ha ve come; so that although you ha ve become a servant to the body , you m ay again rise to that Order (the A.'. A.'.) from which you de scended, joi ning Works (Kamma) to the Sacred Reason ( the Tao)\". 10. The Result of the Second M ethod i s to show the Adept to what end hi s pow ers are destined. When he has passed the Abyss and be comes Nemo, the return of the current causes him \"to appear in the Heaven of Jupiter as a morning s tar o r as an evening s tar\".> In other words he shoul d discover what may be the natu re of his work. Thus Mohammed was a Brother reflected into Netzach, B uddha a B rother reflected into Hod, or , as some say, Daath. The present manifestation o f Frater P. to the outer is in Tiphereth, to the inner in the path of Leo. II. \"First Method.\" Let the Exempt Adept first train himself to think ba ckw ards by e xternal means, as set forth he re following. - -- ( a) Let him learn to write backwards, with either hand. ( b) Let him learn to walk ba ckwards. ( c) Let him constantly watch, if conve nient, cinematograph f ilms, and listen to phonogr aph r ecords, reversed, a nd let him so accustom himself to these that they a ppear natural and a ppreciable as a whole. ( d) Let him practise speaking ba ckwards: thus for \"I am H e\" let him say, \"Eh ma I\". ( e) Let him learn to read ba ckwards. In this it is difficult to a void cheating one 's self, as an expert reader sees a a sentence at a glance. Let his disciple read aloud t o 220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" hi m backwards, slowly at first, then more quickly. ( f) Of his own ingenium, let him devise other methods . 12. I n this his brain will at first be ove rwhelmed by a sense of utter confu sion; secondl y, it will endeavour to evade the difficulty by a trick. The brai n will pretend to be working ba ckwards when {417} i t is merely nor mal. It is d ifficult to de scribe the nature of the trick, but it will be quite obvi ous to a nyone who ha s done practices (a) and ( b) for a day or two. They be come quite e asy, and he will think that he is making pr ogress, an illusion w hich close anal ysis will dispel. 13. H aving be gun t o train his brain in this manner and obt ained some little success, let the Exempt Adept, seated in his Asana, think f irst of his present attitude, next of the act of being s eated, ne xt of his entering the room , next of his robing, e tc. exactly as it happened. And let him most strenuous ly endea vour to think e ach act as happening ba ckwards. It is not enough t o think, \" I a m seated he re, and be fore that I was standing, a nd be fore that I entered the ro om\", etc. That series is the trick de tected in the preliminary pr actices. The series must not run \" ghi-def-abc\" but \"ihgfedcba\": not \"horse a is this\" but \" esroh a si siht\". To obt ain this thoroughl y well, practice (c) is very us eful. The brain will be found t o struggl e constantly to right itself, soon a ccustom ing itself to accept \"esroh\" as merely another glyph f or \"horse\". This tendenc y must be constantly combated. 14. I n the early stages of this practice, the endeavour shoul d be to meticul ous minuteness of detail in remembering a ctions; for the brain's habit of think ing f orward will at first be insuperable. Thinking of large and c omplex action s, then, w ill give a series which we may symbolically write \"opqr stu-hijklmn-ab cdefg\". If these be split into de tail, we shall have \"stu-pqr-o-mn-kl-hij-fg-c de-ab\" which is much ne arer to the ideal \"utsrqponm lkjihgfedcba\". 15. C apacities differ widely, but the Exempt Adept need ha ve no r eason to be discouraged if after a month's continuous labour he find that now and a gain fo r a few seconds his brain really works backwards. 16. The Exempt Adept shoul d concentrate his efforts upon obt aining a perfect picture of five minutes backwards rather than upon e xtending the time covered by hi s meditation. F or this preliminary training of the brain is the Pons Asin orum of the whole process. 17. This five minutes' exercise being s atisfactory, the Exempt Adept may ext end the same at his discretion to cover an hour , a {418} da y, a week, and s o on . Difficulties vanish be fore him as he advances; the extension f rom a day to t he course of his whole life will not prove so difficult as the perfecting of th e five minutes. 18. This practice shoul d be repeated at least four times daily, and pr ogress is show n firstly by t he ever easier runni ng of the brain, secondl y by t he adde d memories which arise. 19. I t is useful to reflect dur ing this practice, which in time becomes almo st mechanical, upon t he way in which effects spring f rom causes. This aids the mind to link its memories, and pr epares the adept for the preliminary pr actice of the second m ethod. 20. H aving a llowed the mind to return for some hundr ed times to the hour of birth, it shoul d be encouraged to endeavour to pe netrate beyond t hat period.> If it be properly trained to run ba ckwards, there will be little difficulty in doing this, although i t is one of the distinct steps in the practice. 21. I t may be then that the memory will persuade the adept of some previous existence. Where this is pos sible, let it be checked by a n appeal to facts, as follows: --- 22. I t often oc curs to men that on vi siting a place to which they ha ve never been, it appears familiar. This may arise from a confusion of thought or a sl ipping of the memory, but it is conceivably a fact. If, then, the adept \"remember\" that he was in a previous life in some city, say Cracow, which he has in this life never visited, let him describe from memo ry the appearance of Cracow, and of its inhabitants, setting dow n their names. Let him further enter into de tails of the city and its customs. And ha ving do 221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"ne this with gr eat minuteness, let him confirm the same by c onsultation w ith hi storians and ge ographers, or by a personal visit, remembering ( both to the cred it of his memory and its discredit) that historians, geographers, and hi mself a re alike fallible. But let him not trust his memory, to assert its conclusions as fact, and a ct thereupon, w ithout most adequate confirmation. 23. This process of checking hi s memory shoul d be practised {419} w ith the e arlier memories of childhood a nd yout h by r eference to the memories and r ecords of others, always reflecting upon t he fallibility even of such safeguards. 24. All this being pe rfected, so that the memory reaches back into aeons inc alculably distant, let the Exempt Adept meditate upon t he fruitlessness of all those years, and upon t he fruit thereof, severing that which is transitory and worthless from that which is eternal. And it may be that he being but an Exemp t Adept may hol d all to be savour less and f ull of sorrow. 25. This being s o, w ithout reluctance will he swear the Oath of the Abyss. 26. \" Second M ethod.\" --- Let the Exempt Adept, fortified by t he practice of the first method, e nter the preliminary pr actice of the second m ethod. 27. \" Second M ethod.\" --- Preliminary Practices. Let him, seated in his Asan a, consider any e vent, and trace it to its immediate causes. And let this be d one very fully and m inutely. Here, for example, is a body e rect and m otionless . Let the adept consider the many f orces which maintain it; firstly, the attra ction of the earth, of the sun, of the planets, of the farthest stars, nay of e very mote of dus t in the room , one of which (could it be annihilated) would cau se that body t o move, although s o imperceptibly. Also the resistance of the fl oor, the pressure of the air, and a ll other external condi tions. Secondl y, the internal forces which sustain it, the vast and c omplex machinery of the skelet on, t he muscles, the blood, t he lymph, t he marrow, all that makes up a man. Th irdly the moral and intellectual forces invol ved, the mind, t he will, the consc iousness. Let him continue this with unr emitting a rdour , searching N ature, lea ving not hing out . 28. N ext, let him take one of the immediate causes of his pos ition, a nd trac e out its equilibrium. For example, the will. What determines the will to aid in hol ding the body e rect and m otionless? 29. This being di scovered, let him choos e one of the forces which de termined his will, and trace out that in similar fashion; and let this process be conti nued for many da ys until the interdependence of all things is a truth assimilat ed in his inmost being. {420} 30. This being a ccomplished, let him trace his own history with special refe rence to the causes of each event. And in this practice he may ne glect to some extent the universal forces which at all times act on a ll, as for example, the attraction of masses, and let him concentrate his attention upon t he principal and de termining or effective causes. For instance, he is seated, pe rhaps, in a count ry place in Spain. Why? Beca use Spain is warm and s uitable for meditation, a nd be cause cities are noisy and crowded. Why is Spain warm? and w hy doe s he wish to meditate? Why c hoos e warm Spain rather than warm India? To the last que stion: Because Spain is nearer t o his hom e. Then why is his hom e near Spain? Because his parents were Germans. And w hy di d they go t o Germany? And s o dur ing the whole meditation. 31. O n another day, let him begin with a que stion of another kind, a nd e very day de vise new que stions, not concerning hi s present situation, but also abstr act que stions. Thus let him conne ct the prevalence of water upon t he surface o f the globe with its necessity to such life as we know , with the specific gravi ty and ot her phys ical properties of water, and let him perceive ultimately thro ugh a ll this the necessity and c oncord of things, not concord as the school men of old be lieved, m aking a ll things for man's benefit or conve nience, but the es sential mechanical concord whose final law is \"inertia.\" And in these meditati ons let him avoid as if it were the plague any s peculations sentimental or fant astic. 32. \" Second M ethod.\" The Practice Proper. --- Having then pe rfected in his mind these conceptions, let him apply them to his own career, forging the link s of memory into the chain of necessity. 222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" And let this be his final que stion: To what pur pose am I fitted?

The springs would imply considerable skill in metals; the varnish much att ainment in that craft. 35. S imilarly, let the adept consider of his own case. Now that he is on t h e point of plungi ng into the Abyss a giant Why? confronts him with upl ifted clu b. 36. There is no m inutest atom of his composition w hich can be withdrawn with out making hi m some other than he is; no us eless moment in his past. Then what is his future?
