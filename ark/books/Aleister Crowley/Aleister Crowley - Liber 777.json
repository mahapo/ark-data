The sceptic will applaud our labours, for that the very catholicity of the symbols denies them any ob jective validity, since, in so many contradictions, something must be false; while the mystic will rejoice equally that the self - same catholicity all - embracing proves that very validity, since after all something must be true. Fortunately we have learnt to combine these ideas, not in the mutual toleration of sub - contraries, but in the affirmation of contraries, that transcending of the laws of intellect which is madness in the ordinary man, genius in the Overman who hath arrived to strike off more fetters f rom our understanding. The savage who cannot conceive of the number six, the orthodox mathematician who cannot conceive of the fourth dimension, the philosopher who cannot conceive of the Absolute — all these are one; all must be impregnated with the Divine Essence of the Phallic Yod of Macroprosopus, and give birth to their idea. True (we may agree with Balzac), the Absolute recedes; we never grasp it; but in the travelling there is joy. Am I no better than a staphylococcus because my ideas still crowd in chains? But we digress. The last attempts to tabulate knowledge are the Kabbala Denudata of Knorr von Rosenroth (a work incomplete and, in some of its parts, prostituted to the service of dogmatic interpretation), the lost symbolism of the Vault in which Christian Rosenkreutz is said to have been buried, some of the work of Dr. Dee and Sir Edward Kelly, some very imperfect tables in Cornelius Agrippa, the “Art” of Raymond Lully, some of the very artificial effusions of the esoteric Theosophists, and of lat e years the knowledge of the Order Rosæ Rubeæ et Aureæ Crucis and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Unluckily, the leading spirit in these latter societies 1 found that his prayer, “Give us this day our daily whisky, and just a wee drappie mair for lu ck!” was sternly answered, “When you have given us this day our daily Knowledge - lecture.” Under these circumstances Daath got mixed with Dewar, and Beelzebub with Buchanan. But even the best of these systems is excessively bulky; modern methods have enable d us to concentrate the substance of twenty thousand pages in two score. The best of the serious attempts to systematise the results of Comparative Religion is that made by Blavatsky. But though she had an immense genius for acquiring facts, she had none whatever for sorting and selecting the essentials. Grant Allen made a very slipshod experiment in this line; so have some of the polemical rationalists; but the only man worthy of our notice is Frazer of the Golden Bough. Here again, there is no tabulatio n; for us it is left to sacrifice literary charm, and even some accuracy, in order to bring out the one great point."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" ii This: That when a Japanese thinks of Hachiman, and a Boer of the Lord of Hosts, they are not two thoughts, but one. The cause of human sect arianism is not lack of sympathy in thought, but in speech; and this it is our not unambitious design to remedy. Every new sect aggravates the situation. Especially the Americans, grossly and crapulously ignorant as they are of the rudiments of human lang uage, seize like mongrel curs upon the putrid bones of their decaying monkey - jabber, and gnaw and tear them with fierce growls and howls. The mental prostitute, Mrs. Eddy (for example), having invented the idea which ordinary people call “God,” christened it “Mind,” and then by affirming a set of propositions about “Mind,” which are only true of “God,” set all hysterical, dyspeptic, crazy Amurrka by the ears. Personally, I don’t object to people discussing the properties of four - sided triangles; but I draw the line when they use a well - known word, such as pig, or mental healer, or dung - heap, to denote the object of their paranoiac fetishism. Even among serious philosophers the confusion is very great. Such terms as God, the Absolute, Spirit, have dozens of connotations, according to the time and place of the dispute and the beliefs of the disputants. Time enough that these definitions and their inter - relation should be crystallised, even at the expense of accepted philosophical accuracy. 2. The principal s ources of our tables have been the philosophers and traditional systems referred to above, as also, among many others, Pietri di Abano, 2 Lilly, Eliphaz Levi, Sir R. Burton, Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu, Buddhist, and Chinese Classics, the Qúran and its com mentators, the Book of the Dead, and, in particular, original research. The Chinese, Hindu, Buddhist, Moslem and Egyptian systems have never before been brought into line with the Qabalah; the Tarot has never been made public. Eliphaz Levi knew the true a ttributions but was forbidden to use them. * All this secrecy is very silly. An indicible Arcanum is an arcanum that cannot be revealed. It is simply bad faith to swear a man to the most horrible penalties if he betray . . ., etc., and then take him myste riously apart and confide the Hebrew Alphabet to his safe keeping. 3 This is perhaps only ridiculous; but it is a wicked imposture to pretend to have received it from Rosicrucian manuscripts which are to be found in the British Museum. To obtain money on these grounds, as has been done by certain moderns, is clear (and, I trust, indictable) fraud. The secrets of Adepts are not to be revealed to men. We only wish they were. When a man comes to me and asks for the Truth, I go away and practice teaching the Differential Calculus to a Bushman; and I answer the former only when I have succeeded with the latter. But to withhold the Alphabet of Mysticism from the learner is the device of a selfish charlatan. That which can be taught shall be taught, and that w hich cannot be taught may at last be learnt.     * This is probably true, though in agreement with the statement of the traducer of Levi’s doctrine and the vilifi er of his noble personality."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"iii 3. As a weary but victorious warrior delights to recall his battles — Fortisan hæc olim meminisse juvabit * — we would linger for a moment upon the difficulties of our task. The question of sacred alphabets has been abandoned as hopeless. As one who should probe the nature of woman, the deeper he goes the rottener it gets; so that at last it is seen that there is no sound bottom. All is arbitrary; † withdrawing out caustics and adopting a protective treatment, we po int to the beautiful clean bandages and ask the clinic to admire! To take one concrete example: the English T is clearly equivalent in sound to the Hebrew t , the Greek t , the Arabic P and the Coptic t , but the numeration is not the same. Again, we have a clear analogy in shape (perhaps a whole series of analogies), which, on comparing the modern alphabets with primeval examples, breaks up and is indecipherable. The same difficulty in another form permeates the question of gods. Priests, to propitiate thei r local fetish, would flatter him with the title of creator; philosophers, with a wider outlook, would draw identities between many gods in order to obtain a unity. Time and the gregarious nature of man have raised gods as ideas grew more universal; secta rianism has drawn false distinctions between identical gods for polemical purposes. Thus, where shall we put Isis, favouring nymph of corn as she was? As the type of motherhood? As the moon? As the great goddess Earth? As Nature? As the Cosmic Egg fro m which all Nature sprang? For as time and place have changed, so she is all of these! What of Jehovah, that testy senior of Genesis, that lawgiver of Leviticus, that Phallus of the depopulated slaves of the Egyptians, that jealous King - God of the times o f the Kings, that more spiritual conception of the Captivity, only invented when all temporal hope was lost, that mediæval battleground of cross - chopped logic, that Being stripped of all his attributes and assimilated to Parabrahman and the Absolute of the Philosopher? Satan, again, who in Job is merely Attorney - General and prosecutes for the Crown, acquires in time all the obloquy attaching to that functionary in the eyes of the criminal classes, and becomes a slanderer. Does any one really think that any angel is such a fool as to try to gull the Omniscient God into injustice to his saints? Then, on the other hand, what of Moloch, that form of Jehovah denounced by those who did not draw huge profit from his rites? What of the savage and morose Jesus of t he Evangelicals, cut by their petty malice from the gentle Jesus of the Italian children? How shall we identify the thaumaturgic Chauvinist of Matthew with the metaphysical Logos of John? In short, while the human mind is mobile, so long will the definit ions of all our terms vary.     * [ Lat. approx. “perhaps it will be pleasant to remember these things one day.”] † All symbolism is perhaps ultimately so; there is no necessary relation in thought between the idea of a mother, the sound of the child’s cry “Ma ,” and the combination of lines ma . This, too, is the extreme case, since “ma” is the sound naturally just produced by opening the lips and breathing. Hindus would make a great fuss over this true connection; but it is very nearly the only one. All thes e beautiful schemes break down sooner or later, mostly sooner."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" iv But it is necessary to settle on something: bad rules are better than no rules at all. We may then hope that our critics will aid our acknowledged feebleness; and if it be agreed that much learning hath made us mad, that we may receive humane treatment and a liberal allowance of rubber - cores in our old age. 4. The Tree of Life is the skeleton on which this body of truth is built. The juxtaposition and proportion of its parts should be fully studied. Practice alone will enable the student to determine how far an analogy may be followed out. Again, some analogies may escape a superficial study. The Beetle is only connected with the sign Pisces through the Tarot Trump “The Moon.” The Camel is only connected with the High Pries tess through the letter Gimel. Since all things whatsoever (including no thing) may be placed upon the Tree of Life, the Table could never be complete. It is already somewhat unwieldy; we have tried to confine ourselves as far as possible to lists of Thin gs Generally Unknown. It must be remembered that the lesser tables are only divided from the thirty - two - fold table in order to economise space; e.g . in the seven - fold table the entries under Saturn belong to the thirty - second part in the large table. We h ave been unable for the moment to tabulate many great systems of Magic; the four lesser books of the Lemegeton, 4 the system of Abramelin, if indeed its Qliphothic ramifications are susceptible of classification, once we follow it below the great and terri ble Demonic Triads which are under the presidency of the Unutterable Name; 5 the vast and comprehensive system shadowed in the Book called the Book of the Concourse of the Forces, 6 interwoven as it is with the Tarot, being, indeed, on one view little more t han an amplification and practical application of the Book of Thoth. 7 But we hope that the present venture will attract scholars from all quarters, as when the wounded Satan leaned upon his spear, “ Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run By angels many and strong,” and that in the course of time a far more satisfactory volume may result. Many columns will seem to the majority of people to consist of mere lists of senseless words. Practice, and advance in the magical or mystical path, will enable little by little to interpret more and more. Even as a flower unfolds beneath the ardent kisses of the Sun, so will this table reveal its glories to the dazzling eye of illumination. Symbolic and barren as it is, yet it shall stand for the athletic student as a perfect sacrament, so that reverently closing its pages he shall exclaim, “May that of which we have partaken sustain us in the search for the Quintessence, the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonus, True Wisdom, and Perfect Happiness. So mote it be!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"v THE TR EE OF LIFE C OL . XII. This arrangement is the basis of the whole system of this book.

I, v. 57 includes the statement: “All these old letters of my Book are aright: but x is not the Star. This also is secret: my prophet shall reveal it to the wise.” In Crow ley’s ‘New Comment’ on this verse, he observes: I see no harm in revealing the mystery of Tzaddi to ‘the wise’; others will hardly understand my explanations. Tzaddi is the letter of The Emperor, the Trump IV, and He is the Star, the Trump XVII. Aquariu s and Aries are therefore counter - changed, revolving on the pivot of Pisces, just as, in the Trumps VIII and XI, Leo and Libra do about Virgo. This last revelation makes our Tarot attributions sublimely, perfectly, flawlessly symmetrical. The fact of its so doing is a most convincing proof of the superhuman Wisdom of the author of this Book to those who have laboured for years, in vain, to elucidate the problems of the Tarot.

As far as I can tell this was a facsimile from the 1955 first edition of 777 Revised ; while Crowley’s original Preface was re - set in the 1955 edition, the Tables of Correspondence, Crowley’s notes thereon, and the appendix giving the trigrams and hexagrams of the I Ching were with minor exceptions straight facsimiles from the original 1909 edition of 777 . In preparing the present edition I have included, besides the P reface, tables, notes and appendix from the original edition, the following additional material from 777 Revised : * The 11 additional columns ( CLXXXIV – CXCIV ). These were originally appended at the end of Table VI. Six were explanatory of or supplement ary to existing columns: ( e.g. numerations of Greek and Arabic letters, transliterations or translations; the “magical formulæ” column was specifically referred to the column of magical weapons); these have been placed immediately after the appropriate col umn. The others have been appended to the end of the appropriate table. While they are hence “out of sequence” I feel this is unlikely to cause confusion as these additional columns are rarely if ever directly referenced by number in other works. * Addit ional correspondences as mentioned in Crowley’s remarks on the various columns. They are inserted into the appropriate columns in double square brackets [[ like this ]] . Also added are: * Numeration of Coptic. * Transliterations of most Hebrew names. In ord er to keep the present work at a manageable size, I have not included: * Yorke’s editorial preface. * The essay on the Magical Alphabet * The Meaning of the Primes from 11 to 97 . * The “Various Arrangements” (mostly from The Book of Thoth ) * The “Explanati ons of the Attributions” – a series of remarks, some developing almost into essays, on columns I - III , V - VIII , X , XI , XIII - XXII , XXXIV , XXXV , XXXVIII - XLIII , XLV , LVI - LXVIII , LXXVII - LXXXVI , and XCVII . * “What is Qabalah?” * “What is a ‘Number’ or a ‘Symbol’? ” (an extract from the New Comment on AL I. 4 ) Some of this additional material may later be made available in HTML format. I have not attempted to preserve the original pagination of the tables of correspondence. For ease of reading, columns are arranged from left to right across a single page. Obvious typos have been corrected; other questionable readings are noted below. T.S. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 51 Endnotes Notes to Crowley’s Preface 1 S.L. “MacGregor” Mathers. 2 The reference is probably to the Heptameron seu elementa magica , a 16 th - century Grimoire of p lanetary magick (published with the Fourth Book of pseudo - Agrippa) deriving in part from the Solomonic cycle and in part from the Liber Juratus or Sworn Book of Honorius , a medieval work on magick (not to be confused with the early modern Grimoire of Honor ius falsely attributed to the third Pope of that name). Its attribution to Pietro d’Abano ( 1253 - 1316 ) is generally recognised as spurious. The uncontested works of d’Abano do deal in part with astrological images and the medical / talismanic use of the s ame ( vide Walker, Spiritual and Demonic Magic and Yates, Giordano Bruno ), and he is occasionally cited as an authority by Renaissance writers such as Ficino and Agrippa; the material specifically attributed to d’Abano in 777 is from the Heptameron , althoug h the images of the decans may be from his genuine works. 3 Probably a reference to the Golden Dawn. After swearing a long and tortuously phrased Oath of Secrecy, the Neophyte was issued a “Knowledge Lecture” which consisted of the names and symbols of th e Elements, Planets and Signs along with the Hebrew Alphabet and the names of the Sephiroth in Hebrew. 4 The Lemegeton is a 17 th - century compilation, probably English, of magical texts attributed to Solomon. The first book, Goetia , describes 72 “Evil Spir its” and gives instructions for evoking them (it derives variously from the Key of Solomon , the Heptameron , the Fourth Book of pseudo - Agrippa and the Pseudomonarchia Dæmonum of Wier). In 777 cols. CLV – CLXVI the spirits are referred to the Decans by day and night. The second book, Theurgia Goetia , describes 27 principal spirits and a very large number of subordinates of whom relatively few are named; of the 27 , 16 are referred to the points of the compass and the other 11 are said to wander and have no fi xed place. They are said to be partly evil and party good, hence the apparently oxymoronic title. It is possible that the Theurgia - Goetia was based on the Steganographia of Trithemius by someone who did not realise that the latter was primarily a work of cryptography. The third book, Ars Paulina , contains a catalogue of Angels for the 12 hours of the day and night, and for the 12 signs and 360 degrees of the Zodiac; they are also attributed to the seven classical Planets. The fourth book, Ars Almadel , i s probably of medieval origin: it divides up the powers it summons into four “Altitudes”, seemingly referred to the cardinal points of the Zodiac. The “fifth book of the Lemegeton”, Ars Nova , is rather a kind of appendix which appears in one MS where it oc cupies one and a half sides of a single folio leaf: it contains an extended prayer associated with the names on the circle and triangle of the Goetia , possibly intended to be spoken while drawing these, along with a short and garbled conjuration containing some highly corrupt Hebrew names, probably also connected with the Goetia as it mentions the brazen vessel; and finally, a lengthy curse targetted at anyone who steals the book. The Ars Nova is sometimes confused with the Ars Notoria (Notary Art) attribu ted to Solomon, which latter rather appears to be a medieval magical derivative of classical art of memory, based around the contemplation of images or notæ while repeating prayers. The Ars Notoria was condemned by Aquinas (cited in Yates, Art of Memory ) and various Renaissance writers such as Erasmus and Agrippa (in De vanitate &c. ); Robert Turner produced an English translation which was made less than useful by the omission of the figures: this translation has been incorporated into some later MSS and p rinted editions of the Lemegeton . 5 In The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage (tom. II cap. XIX ) are tabulated the names of various Evil Spirits: chief among these are the “Four Princes and Superior Spirits”, to wit Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan an d Belial who may perhaps be referred to the Elements (I would suggest Fire, Water, Air, Earth respectively); immediately below these are eight “Sub - Princes”, namely Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, Amaimon ( vide 777 col. LXVIII ), Astarot, Magot, Asmodee and Belzebu d ( sic ); a total of 316 named spirits are listed below the eight Sub - Princes, some subject to one of them, some shared between two or more. 6 The Book of the Concourse of the Forces is the title of a collection of Golden Dawn papers loosely based on the “E nochian” material which emerged from the ceremonial skrying of John Dee and Edward Kelly. Crowley later published a terse and incomplete abstract of this material as “A brief abstract of the symbolic representation of the Universe” in Equinox I ( 7 - 8 ). Se e also Regardie (ed.) The Golden Dawn , vol. IV. 7 This would not be a view generally shared by most serious practitioners and students of Dee and Kelly’s magick. Unless Crowley is talking about the G.D. version of “Enochian Magic” in which case he has a p oint. 8 4 Planes: the first consists solely of Kether; the second of Chokmah and Binah; the third of Chesed through to Yesod; the fourth of Malkuth only. These are identified by some with the Four Worlds. 3 Pillars / 7 Planes: see col. XII . 7 palaces: s ee col. LXXXVII et seq.

The numbers after the Qliphoth of the Sephiroth represent which of the seven “palaces” they are referred to: see the arrangements in Col. LXXXVIII et. seq. T ransliterations are as given in Crowley’s remarks on this column in 777 Revised , although a few have been altered where they are not consistent with the Hebrew spelling. Col. XIV. These represent G.D. attributions, before Crowley changed the titles of a n umber of the Trumps in The Book of Thoth and exchanged the attributions of the Star and Emperor based on AL I.57. Col. XIX. Transliterations of Egyptian names have been left as in the first edition. These differ from both modern transliterations and thos e employed by early 20 th - century writers such as Budge. Line 1 : Asar is better known by the Hellenized form Osiris; Asar - un - Nefer (“Osiris the beautiful”) was a particular epiphet or title of this god. Hadith in this line (also Hadit in line 0 ) is not a h istorical Egyptian deity but refers to the entity described in cap. II of The Book of the Law ; the name is a garbled or corrupt form of Heru - Behutet (Horus of Behutet), a solar - martial form of Horus symbolized by the winged disk. Heru - Ra - Ha is not a histo rical Egyptian deity but is mentioned in cap. III of The Book of the Law and is said to combine Hoor - par - Kraat (Horus the Child) and Ra - Hoor - Khuit (Ra - Horus of the Two Horizons). Line 6 : “On” was not an Egyptian deity but a transliteration into Hebrew ( }a or }wa ) of the name of the Egyptian solar cult - centre called Heliopolis by the Greeks. The confusion arose through a misreading by Freemasons of Genesis XLI , 45 and 50 where Joseph married “Asenath daughter of Poti - phera priest of On.” ON spelt }u as a f ormula is another matter entirely; see Col. CLXXXVII . Hrumachis is probably a variant spelling of Harmachis (Hor - Maku), said by Budge ( Gods of the Egyptians vol. I p. 470 ) to be the Greek name for Heru - Khuti, Horus of the two horizons, who represented the sun from sunrise to sunset. Line 13 : Chomse also spelt Khons or Khensu. In one legend (cited by Budge, op. cit. I , 448 ) he is said to be the son of the cat goddess Bast who was also associated with the moon (to complicate matters Bast has solar aspects i n some accounts). Lines 16 , 32 - bis : Ahapshi is the Apis Bull (GD Coptic spelling). Ameshet is Amset (or Mestha), one of the Children of Horus. Line 17 : The Rekti goddesses and Merti goddesses both appear to have been specific titles or epiphets of Isis an d Nephthys. Line 19 : Pasht (according to Budge, op. cit . I , 517 ) is Pekh or Pekhit, a minor lioness goddess. Mau is onomatopœic Egyptian for ‘cat’ and appears to have been an epiphet of Ra. Line 22 : Ma is more usually spelt Maat or Ma’at. Lines 23 , 31 : Au ramoth and Thoum - aesh - neith were never Egyptian deities but were names constructed on Qabalistic principles by the Golden Dawn to refer to water and fire; similarly the name Tarpesheth (Tharpesht) is unknown prior to G.D. material, although she appears to be a hybrid of Bast and Sekhet. Line 24 : Typhon was a monster in Greek myth, probably a personification of destructive forces of nature, who was identified with Set in late classical times. Add Selket, whose symbol was the scorpion. I have no idea what K hephra is doing here. Line 25 : Add Neith (Net) who is traditionally depicted with a bow and arrows. Line 26 : Khem is identified by Budge ( op. cit. , I , 97 ) with the phallic god Min or Amsu, and is said to have been the god of Apu (Panopolis). Line 28 : Aheph i is H a pi, one of the Children of Horus. Line 29 : Add Hequet (Hekt). Line 31 : Kabeshunt is probably Qebhsennuf, one of the Children of Horus. Line 32 : I have no idea who ‘Mako’ is. In the Golden Dawn Z1 paper the Children of Horus or Canopic Gods had ‘invi sible stations’ in the corners of the Temple. The most immediate source for the elemental attributions, though, is the Golden Dawn paper on “Enochian Chess” where the four pawns of each side are referred to these God - forms. It is not clear why Crowley om itted Tuamutef for Water: (a G.D. Coptic form of this name is cited in connection with the “Eagle Kerub” in a ritual in Equinox I ( 3 )). In a myth recounted by Budge ( op. cit. vol. I p. 158 ) these gods are said to have grasped the four pillars of heaven as sceptres: Amset the South, H a pi the North, Tuamutef the East, and Qebhsennuf the West. They were also said to guard the Canopic Jars in which the internal organs of the deceased were preserved, and their G.D. attributions to the cross - quarters probably de rive from a single find of an Egyptian tomb which had the four jars with the images of the gods disposed thus. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CORRESPONDENCES 53 Col. XX. Line 23 : Possibly a G.D. Coptic spelling of Ashtoreth who according to Budge ( op. cit. ) was worshipped in Egypt in the later dynastic period (in Regardie, Complete G.D. , “Sati - Ashtoreth” is referred to the Fire Queen in “Enochian Chess”, the name is spelt I#haourey in Crowley’s notes). Line 25 : A G.D. Coptic spelling of Aroueris. Col. XXI. All this is derived from the famous speech in cap. 42 of the Book of the Dead . Some minor errors have been corrected ( e.g. Line 12 read “Aupu — the Hips”). The Planets are referred according to the attributions in Agrippa (tom. II cap. x); hence the duplication of left and right eye, ear and nostril. Line 15 . Budge has “hands.” Line 32 bis. The Hebrew is Alim Chayyim , “the living Gods.” Col. XXIII. “Nothing and Neither P nor p'”) and “Beaten and Scattered Corpse” each denote two different meditations. Col. XXXV. Agrippa ( De occ. phil. tom II cap xi v) in his “Orphic Scale of the Number Twelve” refers the twelve principle Gods of Rome to the Zodiac: a Pallas (Minerva) b Venus c Phoebus d Mercury e Jupiter f Ceres g Vulcan h Mars i Diana j Vesta k Juno l Neptune. Crowley included most of these, omitting only Jupiter and Phoebus. Col. XXXVI. The Evangelists follow their traditional attribution to the Kerubim. Godwin gives the Apostles thus (he does not state his source): a Matthias b Thaddeus c Simon d John e Peter f Andew g Bartholemew h Phillip i James son of Zebedee j Thomas k Matthew l James son of Alpheus. Col. XXXVIII. Line 7 : Iynx: Grk., Iugx (pl. Iuggej ), the wryneck: a bird of the woodpecker family which had the misfortune to be used in early Greek love magic k (hence the attribution); but in the Chaldæan Oracles the Iunges appear to have been a group of ministering powers who stood between the theurgist and the Supreme God (source: Lewy, Chaldæan Oracles and Theurgy ), whence they are cited in the ritual of the Star Ruby. Not ‘lynx’ as it is sometimes misread; nor does it rhyme with “sphinx.” As noted in the remarks on this column in 777 Revised , AC’s source here was Levi. Line 8 : Monoceros de Astris means “Unicorn from the Stars” and is a title of the grade o f 3°=8 8 Practicus (referred to Hod) in the Golden Dawn. Col. XXXIX. Line 8 : Anhalonium Lewinii is now known by the botanical name Lophophora williamsi . Col. CLXXXVII. See Magick in Theory and Practice for a discussion of some of these formulæ. Another set of attributions of magical formulæ to the Tree of Life survives in one of Crowley’s magical notebooks and may be studied in Magick: Book 4 Parts I - IV (editor’s notes to Appendix V col. 34 ). Line 0 : LASTAL is not necessarily an error for LAShTAL (for wh ich see Liber V vel Reguli ) but may be a variant form, the ST representing the Coptic sou , identified with the Greek stau and attributed to Kether (see Col LI and Magick , loc. cit.). M . . . . M probably refers to MUAUM, said (in a letter from C.S. Jones to Frank Bennet) to be the Word of a Neophyte of A ∴ A ∴ , representing the whole course of the breath. Spelt \\ wawm in Hebrew, it adds to 93 ( it may also contain a concealed yod , not pronounced or counted in the enumeration, which would explain the fourth do t in M . . . . M and the extra coloured band used to glyph the word in Pyramidos ). Lines 1 - 9 : In The Heart of the Master , section Aves (‘Birds’), nine magical formula are given as the voices of various symbolic birds, apparently referred to the Sephiroth 1 - 9, thus: 1 (the Swan): A UMGN (one version has A UM ) 2 (the Phœnix): A L 3 ( the Raven): A MEN 4 (the Eagle): S U 5 (the Hawk): A GLA 6 (the Pelican): I AO 7 (the Dove): H RILIU 8 (the Ibis): A BRAHADABRA 9 (the Vulture): M U Line 24 : Possibly ON ( ayin nun ) should a lso be referred here."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"NOTES 54 Col. XLVI. Crowley’s later attributions of the trigrams of the I Ching , etc. , to the Sephiroth are given in The Book of Thoth , thusly: 0 : Tao. 1 : Tao Teh. 2 : Yang. 3 : Yin. Daath: Khien. 4 : Tui. 5 : K b n. 6 : Li. 7 : K b n. 8 : Sun. 9 : Khân . 10 : Khw b n. Col. XLVIII. Most of these refer to symbols appearing in Golden Dawn rituals. Line 26 : Possibly should read “Calvary Cross of 6 , Solid” as the faces of such will total 26 squares. Col LI. This arrangement differs slightly from the G.D. att ributions given in Regardie (ed.), Complete G.D. (buried in the Ring and Disk paper), in that t and y have been interchanged. In the printed edition of 777 , G was given in line 1 as well as line 13 , and $ in line 10 ( C did not appear on the table). Thes e have been corrected as compositor’s errors; $ has been placed in line 1 and C in line 10 in accordance with G.D. attributions. For each letter, ‘upper case’ and ‘lower case’ forms are shown; the degree of difference between these two forms varies between letters. The two un - numbered columns are extracted in this instance from Appendix V to the ‘Blue Brick’ edition of Magick , in turn deriving from Crowley’s magical notebooks. Numbers seem in most cases to be those of the equivalent Greek letter; the ‘Engl ish equivalents’ do not necessarily represent the original phonetic value of the letters but rather refer to the transliterations employed in the Golden Dawn, where Coptic spellings of the names of various Egyptian Gods were constructed according to the Qa balistic attributions of the letters. The letter sou ( $, # ) did not historically have a phonetic value as such but was rather used to fill out the numbering scheme by standing for 6 ; whence it was identified with the obsolete Greek letter stau which was a lso used for number 6, and given the value ‘st.’ Col LII. The letters are shown in their ‘isolated’ forms; since Arabic is written cursively, letter forms vary slightly depending on whether the letter appears on its own, or in the beginning, in the middle , or at the end of a word. The repetition of one letter in lines 9 and 10 appears to be deliberate. Table II (the Elements) Col. LXVI. The numerical value of each of these spellings gives the number in Col. LXV , which, rendered in Hebrew letters, gives the “secret name” in Col. LXIV . Line 31 . Originally given hyh wyw hyh dwy , which adds to 82 rather than 72 . The reading here is from Mathers’ introduction to Kaballah Unveiled. Table III (the Planets) Col. LXXVIII. Line 13 . Various spellings of this horrendous name have appeared in the literature, and as mentioned in Crowley’s notes on this column, the spelling given here can only be made to add to 3321 by counting the final \\ as 700 rather than the more usual 600 . Liber D had \\ yrhc hwrb duw \\ ycycrtb aklm , Malkah be - Tarshishim ve - A’ad be - Ruah Sheharim, which gives the required value without any such dubious fudges. The oldest known form of this name is \\ yqjc jwrb du \\ ytycrtb aklm , Malkah be - Tarshithim A’ad be - Ruach Shechaqim (Agrippa, op. cit. , lib. II , cap. xxii). Table IV (the Sephiroth) Col. LXXXVIII. These originally given in Latin; I have translated them into English. Col. XCII. The original had this in Latin; it was a slight garbling of the Vulgate of Isaiah VI , 2 - 3. I have translated it into English as it appeared. Col. XCIV. Despite being headed “English of Palaces” this column was originally in Latin. The translations of the Seven Heavens are mostly from Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia , s.v. “Heaven.” Col. CIII. This column originally p rinted in Latin. Col. CVIII. For what it’s worth (see Crowley’s note on this column), here are the transliterations of the Hebrew names: Line 2 . Samael (“poison of God” or “blind god”). lams = 131 = Pan . Line 3 . Isheth Zanunim (Woman of Whoredom), said to be the wife of Samael. \\ ynwnz tca = 864 = \\ ycdq cwdq , Qadosh Qadeshim , Holy of Holies. Doubtless there is an Arcanum concealed here, possibly along the lines of “you can prove anything with Gematria if you try hard enough.” Line 5 . Ashteroth. Historica lly a Middle Eastern goddess (a.k.a. Ishtar, Astarté, etc. ), denounced by Old Testament writers and given an inexplicable sex change by medieval demonologists."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CORRESPONDENCES 55 Line 6 . Chiva, the Beast; said to be the offspring of Samael and Isheth Zanunim (see Mathers’ in troduction to Kaballah Unveiled , para 61 ). Only a hideous fudge (to wit ( a ) mis - spelling the name as ahija , ( b ) writing each letter out in full and ( c ) counting hé in full as ah rather than the more usual hh ) can get this name to add to 666 . Line 7 . Asmo dai. Appears in the apocryphal Book of Tobit. Sometimes also known by the Latinised form Asmodeus. The name is possibly a modification of Aeshma Deva, an evil spirit from Persian mythology. Line 8 . Belial. Said to be the chief of the evil spirits in s ome late Jewish apocalyptic literature ( e.g. the Testament of the 12 Patriarchs), but in the Old Testament the name was a mere term of abuse meaning “masterless” or “worthless.” Line 9 . Lilith. She gets everywhere. Line 10 . Naamah. The sister of Tubal - Cain (see Masonic symbolism); but in the Zohar she gets turned into another version of Lilith. Col. CIX. Rather than use planetary symbols to distinguish the Kings and Dukes as in the printed edition, I have split this column. For Daath add King Bela son of Beor ( rwub }b ulb ) and Dukes Timnah ( uamt ), Alvah ( hwlu ) and Jetheth ( tty ). Col. CX. Line 1 . Ruach Elohim Chayyim , the Spirit of the Living Gods. The first edition of 777 had as a subtitle \\ yyj \\ yhla hwr tja , Achath Ruach Elohim Chayyim (“one [is] the Spirit of the Living Elohim”), a line from the Sepher Yetzirah which adds to 777 . Cols. CXII – CXIII. These sets of attributions were extracted by the Golden Dawn from the first volume of Kabbala Denudata . The symbols in 7 and 8 apparently represent “hermaphroditic Brass.” Col. CXIV. The numbers are an addition; each password adds to the “mystic number” of the Sephirah corresponding. Vide Col. X. Col. CXV. The entries in this column were originally given as initials only. Col. CXXI. These are Gold en Dawn titles. The A ∴ A ∴ titles in the 1 st order differ slightly; 0 °= 0 8 is Probationer, 1 °= 10 8 is Neophyte, 2 °= 9 8 Zelator and the “waiting” grade between Philosophus and Adeptus Minor is called Dominus Liminis. Cols. CXXIX – CXXXII. These are the Angels of the Shem ha - Mephorash or Divided Name of God, a full explanation of which would be beyond the scope of this footnote. On each row, the name on the left rules the card in question by day, the one on the right by night. Cols. CXXXIII – CXXXVI. Words in square brackets are the Book of Thoth keywords for these cards where these differ from the titles. Table V (the Zodiac) Col. CXXXIX. The outer planets – Uranus ( ( ), Nepture ( ) ) and Pluto ( * ) and the Nodes of the Moon were not given in this table in 777 , but appeared in these positions in the table “The Essential Dignities of the Planets” in The Book of Thoth . In Magick Crowley added an additional column, the “Superior Planetary Governers” of the signs; initially this referred the Cardinal signs to the “ Primum Mobile”, the Kerubic signs to Uranus and the Mutable signs to Neptune; in The Book of Thoth the Cardinal signs were referred to Pluto (discovered in the 1930 s). Cols. CXLIX – CLI. Agrippa (tom. II cap. xxxvii) gives a somewhat different set of imag es for the decans, along with the significance of each. It is believed Agrippa derived from Latin translations of the Picatrix , a medieval Arabic work on magic. The images given here are close to those printed by Regardie in Complete Golden Dawn , and thu s probably represent those circulating in the G.D., though Regardie also gave the signification of each image (similar but not always identical to those in Agrippa). Cols. CLV – CLXVI. I have added transliterations of the names of the spirits and numbers according to the order in which they appear in the Goetia . Planetary symbols indicate the rank of the spirit and the material from which its seal is to be made (some spirits have two ranks), thus: Rank Planet Metal Prince Jupiter Tin Earl  Mars Iron King Sol Gold Duke Venus Copper President Mercury Mercury (hmm...) Marquis Luna Silver Note that in rendering the names of the demons into Hebrew, some suffixes like – ion, – ius, etc. have been dropped. An alternative s et of attributions and Hebrew spellings can be found in The Sword and the Serpent by Denning and Phillips, and Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia . "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"NOTES 56 Cols. CLXVII – CLXXI. A completely different set of names for the dekans and the gods referred to them may be found in Budge’s Gods of the Egyptians , vol. ii pp 304 - 310 . I am unaware of Crowley’s source for these attributions: generally the names seem at the very least somewhat Hellenized. Notes to Crowley’s notes 1 Because jk = Koch , Power, and hm is the “se cret name” of Yetzirah ( vide Col. LXIV ). 2 i.e. , the Hebrew word for “ten.” 3 Unclear. Possibly an error for }wmiama , Amaimon. The G.D. Qliphoth lecture has }wdba , Abaddon. 4 Possibly an error for hmun , Naamah or Nahemah. The G.D. Qliphoth lecture as pr inted by Zalewski ( 1994 ) has “Maamah” which itself may be a misprint. 5 “Rosicrucian Chess” is also known as “Enochian Chess” although its connection with Dee and Kelly’s magick is tenuous at best; it is a four - handed game also used as a system of divinati on, loosely based on an ancient Indian game called Chaturanga, but with pieces representing Egyptian Gods. It was probably created by W. Wynn Westcott. For a more detailed account see Zalewski, Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn (Llewellyn). Rather than a ttempt to transliterate and then decipher the Coptic names given by Crowley (some of which I suspect are corrupt or misprinted) I will give the versions of these names as listed in Regardie (ed.), Complete G.D. (tom. X pp. 113 - 4 ). In many cases these are not reasonable transliterations of the names printed in 777 . Fire : Bishop: Toum. Queen: Sati - Ashtoreth. Knight: Ra. Castle: Anouke (possibly Ankhet, a title of Isis) King: Kneph (Khnemu). Water : Bishop: Hapimon (the Nile god) Queen: Thouerist (Ta - urt the h ippopotamus goddess) Knight: Sebek Castle: Shu King: Osiris Air : Bishop: Shu Queen: Knousou Knight: Seb Castle: Tharpesht (a G.D. amalgam of Bast and Sekhet) King: Socharis (Seker; an early god who became identified with Ptah, and later with Osiris) Earth : Bishop: Aroueris Queen: Isis Knight: Hoori (Horus) Castle: Nephthys King: Aeshoori ( i.e. Osiris again) Pawns Knight’s pawn: Kabexnuv (Qebhsennuf) Queen’s Pawn: Tmoumathph ( sic ) (Tuamutef) Bishop’s Pawn: Ahepi (H a pi) Rook’s Pawn: Ameshet (Mestha) 6 I canno t identify the first three of these names. I believe the remaining four were intended to be G.D. Coptic spellings of Hapi (Ahephi), Tuamutef (Toumathph), Mestha (Ameshett) and Qebhsennuf (Kabexnuv), the Sons of Horus, and have corrected them accordingly. 7 De. occ. phil. lib. I . cap xxiii. The following six chapters list various things said to be under the power of the other six classical planets. See also cap. xxii which gives general attributions for the planets and the theory behind all this, and cap. xxxii, “What things are under the Signs, the Fixed Stars, and their images.” 8 On typographic and chronological evidence this line was an addition in 777 Revised . 9 As noted above, this last is a fudge which was probably made necessary by someone miscopyi ng the name of the Intelligence of the Intelligences of the Moon so it no longer added to 3321 . 10 The Golden Dawn lectures give a slightly different attribution of the fingers, based on the points of the Pentagram, thus: the thumb to Spirit, the index to W ater, the medius to Fire, the third finger to Earth and the little finger to Air. 11 In the Golden Dawn diagram (in turn derived from von Rosenroth) from which Col. CVI. was derived, the seven Earths of Col. CIV. were also enclosed by the four seas. The In fernal Rivers are referred to the Elements thus: Air, Cocytus; Water, Styx; Fire, Phlegethon; Earth, Acheron (source: Godwin’s Cabalistic Encyclopedia ). 12 “heled, concealed, and never revealed.” 13 The names appear in a supplement to the Rituel de Haute Mag ie as part of an “explanation” of the “Nuctemeron of Apollonius of Tyana.” In cap. XVII of the Rituel Levi gives the names and characters of another 24 Zodiacal genii, two for each sign. The latter are here omitted. 14 i.e. , the author of the Heptameron ( see note to Preface on this point). But much of the following derives from the Liber Juratus in any case."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CORRESPONDENCES 57 15 I have reduced this into a single table to save space, representing each day and Angel with the corresponding planetary symbol. 16 The names here ha ve been conformed to the version of the Heptameron printed in the Lyons edition of Agrippa’s Opera . Crowley, possibly because he was working from a corrupted copy, stated that none were given for Winter; although the names he gave for the Sun and Moon in Autumn were those referred to Winter by pseudo - Abano. 17 Probably in his Oedipus Ægypticus. It is this book (late 17 th century) which as far as I am aware contains the earliest known appearance of the version of the Tree of Life used by the G.D. and Crowle y, and in fact most modern Western occultists. Other Tree of Life arrangements are discussed by Aryeh Kaplan in his translation of the Sepher Yetzirah . Appendix: the Yi King Transliterations of Chinese names follow the system used by Legge in Sacred Books of the East , which is not in general current use. Note that italicised letters have different phonetic values to non - italicised ( K is “thin ( tenuis ) modified guttural consonant”, Kh “aspirated thin modified guttural”). b represents the ‘neutral’ vowel s ound. Where Crowley has ‘tz’, Legge used a character something like a stylised 3, which I have been unable to find in any of the typefaces I currently have; but as far as I can tell from the table of transliteration conventions, this is equivalent to the Hebrew x (described helpfully as “Spiritus asperrimus 2” under dental consonants). While this may be a little awkward and confusing, I would submit it is to be preferred to a transliteration scheme which manages to give the same transliteration for two di fferent Chinese characters ( vide the Wilhelm - Baynes I Ching , s.v. Hexagram 63 ). The main traditional glosses to the trigrams are: 7 Heaven, sky 6 Water (marsh or lake) 5 Fire, sun, lightning 4 Thunder 3 Wind and wood 2 Water (rain, clouds, springs), m oon 1 Hill or mountain 0 Earth Additional traditional correspondences can be found in the “EighthWing” (Appendix V. in the Legge edition, “Shuo Kwa / Discussion of the Trigrams” in Part II of the Wilhelm - Baynes edition)."}]
