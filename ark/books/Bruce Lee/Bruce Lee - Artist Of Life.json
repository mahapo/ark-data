INDEED, AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY HUMANBEING AT A PARTICULAR CONFLUENCE IN THE COURSE OF OUR DAILY EXISTENCE MAY DEFINEOUR DESTINY.I IMAGINE THAT MOST OF US CAN NAME ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXERTEDSUCH A LIFE-CHANGING INFLUENCE UPON US. PERHAPS YOUR FATHER OR OTHER GAVE YOUSUCH INSPIRATION, A TEACHER OR A FRIEND, A WRITER OR A FIGURE FROM HISTORY.UNDOUBTEDLY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE PICKED UP THIS BOOK, YOU CONSIDER THAT BRUCE LEEMAY BE ONE OF THOSE RARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAS PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED YOUR LIFE.[../Images/f1.jpg]IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT MY LIFE IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT ITWOULD HAVE BEEN HAD I NOT MET BRUCE ON THAT MOMENTOUS DAY IN 1963. I AM GRATEFULFOR THE NINE YEARS OF MARRIAGE THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SHARING WITH THISRARE AND GIFTED INDIVIDUAL. IN ADDITION TO THE ADVENTURE OF LIVING WITH ATHOROUGHLY ENERGIZING PERSON AND THE JOY OF CREATING A FAMILY WITH HIM, ILEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM BRUCE WHICH HAS GUIDED ME THROUGH ALL THE YEARS SINCEHE LEFT.IN THINKING ABOUT THE ENORMITY OF THE WORK THAT BRUCE ACCOMPLISHED IN HIS SHORTLIFE, I AM DRAWN TO THE IDEA THAT THE ENERGY OF THE SOUL IS NEVER EXTINGUISHEDWITH THE PASSING OF THE PHYSICAL BODY. EVEN AS A YOUNG MAN, BRUCE OFTENDESCRIBED “A MYSTERIOUS POWER” WITHIN HIM THAT MOTIVATED THE PATHS HE CHOSE INHIS LIFETIME. I FIND IT TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL TRAIT THAT BRUCE WAS ABLE TORECOGNIZE AND VALUE THE MYSTERIOUS GIFT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM. HE KNEWINSTINCTIVELY THAT HIS LIFE HAD PURPOSE, AND EVEN AS HE ALLOWED THE WISDOM OFTHE AGES TO SPEAK THROUGH HIM, HE SIMULTANEOUSLY DIRECTED HIS SELF-WILL TOWARDTHE ATTAINMENT OF HIS VISIONS.BRUCE OFTEN SAID THAT IT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS DURING ONE’S LIFE THAT MAKES THEDIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE, IT IS THE WAY ONE CHOOSES TO REACT TO THOSECIRCUMSTANCES THAT TESTS THE METTLE OF A LIFE WELL LIVED. TRACING THE DOMINANTPATTERNS IN BRUCE’S LIFE ILLUSTRATES THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF CHOICE, AND, PERHAPS,THE GUIDANCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS POWER WHICH DIRECTED HIS PATH. IT WAS NOT ANACCIDENT THAT BRUCE BEGAN THE STUDY OF GUNG FU UNDER MASTER YIP MAN, WHOINSTILLED IN HIM THE GREATER MEANING OF MARTIAL ART BEYOND THE PHYSICAL. IT WASNOT HAPPENSTANCE THAT PROMPTED BRUCE TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OFWASHINGTON, BUT THE DESIRE TO INFUSE THE SPIRIT OF PHILOSOPHY INTO MARTIAL ART.IT WAS NOT BY CHANCE THAT, IN CRAFTING HIS ACTING SKILLS, BRUCE REFUSED THE PATHOF THE IMAGE-MAKERS AND, INSTEAD, WORKED TO EXPOSE AND EXPRESS HIS TRUE SELF.AND, ALWAYS, THE CHOICE OF CONTINUING SELF-EDUCATION THROUGH VORACIOUS READINGAND PROLIFIC WRITING LED BRUCE DOWN THE PATH OF EXPANDING AND BROADENING HISPOTENTIAL.BRUCE WAS A HIGHLY EDUCATED MAN BECAUSE HE NEVER MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO LET A“FACT” OR A “SITUATION” TEACH HIM MORE ABOUT HIMSELF. AS A SCHOLAR, HE WAS ABLETO TURN THIS INTELLECTUAL LEARNING INWARD AND MAKE IT A TOOL FORSELF-CULTIVATION. AS A PHILOSOPHER, HE WAS ABLE TO APPLY SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES OFHIS ART TO THE BROADER ENDEAVOR OF LIVING LIFE AS A “REAL” HUMAN BEING.A TRULY EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTERISTIC OF BRUCE WAS THAT HE HAD THE ABILITY TOCOMMUNICATE HIS LEARNING PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS INTERNALIZING OR LIVINGIT. WHETHER HE WAS TEACHING, ACTING, WRITING, OR SPEAKING, BRUCE WAS ABLE TOREVEAL HIS OWN PERSONAL PROCESS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID, IN HISMARTIAL ART AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF FILM HE WAS “SIMPLY AND HONESTLYEXPRESSING HIMSELF.” SUPERFICIALLY, THIS COULD BE CALLED “CHARISMA,” BUT ON AMORE PROFOUND LEVEL THIS ABILITY TO BARE THE SOUL SHOULD BE CALLED “ARTISTRY.”JUST AS MICHELANGELO CHIPPED AWAY AT A BLOCK OF MARBLE TO REVEAL DAVID, SO DIDBRUCE PEEL AWAY THE LAYERS OF HIS INNER SOUL TO EXPOSE HIS TRUE SELF TO THEWORLD.DO YOU KNOW INSTINCTIVELY THAT THIS IS A GENUINE HUMAN BEING WHEN YOU SEE BRUCEON THE SCREEN? IS IT THIS, THEN, THIS PEELING PROCESS, THAT SETS BRUCE APARTFROM OTHER MARTIAL ARTISTS AND ACTORS? FOR THOSE OF US WHO KNEW HIM PERSONALLY,THE BRUCE WHO WAS THE ACTOR IS THE SAME MAN WE KNEW IN REAL LIFE. HE WAS BIGGERTHAN LIFE IN ALL WAYS—ON AND OFF THE SCREEN.BRUCE’S WORDS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS VOLUME SPEAK SO ELOQUENTLY IT IS HARDLYNECESSARY FOR ME TO EXPOUND UPON HIS THOUGHTS. I SIMPLY WELCOME YOU TO ANOPPORTUNITY TO KNOW BRUCE BETTER THROUGH SHARING HIS INSIGHTS, AND PERHAPS THENYOU WILL KNOW YOURSELF BETTER, TOO. THE ULTIMATE DESTINATION OF BRUCE’S JOURNEYWAS PEACE OF MIND—THE TRUE MEANING OF LIFE. I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT BECAUSE BRUCECHOSE THE PATH OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE OVER ACCUMULATION OF FACTS, AND THE PATH OFSELF-EXPRESSION OVER IMAGE ENHANCEMENT, THAT HE DID REACH HIS DESTINY WITH APEACEFUL MIND. THAT FACT GIVES ME PEACE OF MIND.BRUCE SAID, “TO KNOW YOURSELF TAKES A LIFETIME.” HE DID NOT WASTE A MOMENT.—LINDA LEE CADWELLODYSSEY OF AN OLD SOULBY LINDA LEE CADWELLTHE OLD SOUL WANDERED THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE.THE SOUL WAS WISE, FOR IT HAD LIVED IN THE MINDS OF THE GREAT THINKERS OF THEWORLD.THE SOUL WAS DEEP, FOR ITS WEALTH OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE COULD FILL A BOTTOMLESSLAKE.THE SOUL HAD GREAT POWER, BORN OF KNOWING ITSELF THROUGH COUNTLESS LIVES OFINTROSPECTION.IN THE REALM OF NO-TIME, THERE ARE MANY NEW SOULS; THEY LEAVE OFTEN TO LIVE INTHE HUMAN WORLD.BUT THE OLD SOUL LINGERED IN THE ETHEREAL NOTHINGNESS, AWAITING THE CALL OF ASPECIAL CORPOREAL HOST.IT HAPPENED THAT THE HEART AND MIND OF A YOUNG BOY CRIED OUT FOR THE ATTENTIONOF THE OLD SOUL.THE IMMORTAL GUEST WOULD ONCE AGAIN GRACE MANKIND WITH HIS WISDOM ANDCOMPASSION.FOR A MERE THIRTY-TWO EARTHLY YEARS THE SOUL BURNED WITH A PASSIONATE,MYSTERIOUS POWER.ENERGIZING THE YOUNG MAN’S SEARCH FOR TRUTH, LIBERATING AN UNPARALLELED CREATIVEAND SPIRITUAL FORCE.THE TWIN CAPTAINS OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM WERE WELL SERVED BY THE OLD SOUL’SMORTAL TENURE, FORTHE SOUL OF AN ARTIST DWELT AMONG US FOR AN IMPERCEPTIBLE MOMENT IN THE SPAN OFTIME.NEVER IN VAIN, FOR, IN THE WAKE OF THIS OLD SOUL’S ODYSSEY, A LEGACY OF INSIGHTSWAS RECORDEDTO ENRICH THE HEART AND MIND, AND PERHAPS TO AGE THE SOUL, OF ONE WHO DARES TOGAZE INTO THE MIRROR OF REAL LIFE."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONAN “ARTIST OF LIFE”APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS BEFORE HIS DEATH, BRUCE LEE WROTE A PROFOUNDLY PERSONALESSAY, “IN MY OWN PROCESS,” WHICH SET OUT HIS INSIGHTS ON THE PROCESS OF LIFE.WRITING FROM HIS HEART, LEE JOTTED DOWN HIS DEEPEST FEELINGS BEFORE THEY COULDBE PASSED THROUGH THE FILTER OF HIS EGO.OVER SEVERAL WEEKS, HE RETURNED TO HIS ESSAY IN BETWEEN FILMING ENTER THE DRAGONAND DRAFTING ADDITIONAL IDEAS FOR THE GAME OF DEATH. HE ADDED MORE JOTTINGS ASTHE INSIGHTS CAME TO HIM—AT HIS OFFICE IN GOLDEN HARVEST STUDIOS, HONG KONG, INHIS STUDY IN KOWLOON TONG, OR WHEN HE WENT OUT TO EAT. ALL TOLD, HE WROTE EIGHTVERSIONS OF THE ESSAY, EACH CONTAINING SLIGHTLY MORE OF HIS EXPERIENCES AS AMARTIAL ARTIST, AS AN ACTOR, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, AS A HUMAN BEING.[../Images/i1.jpg]IN THE FINAL DRAFT OF THIS ESSAY (WHICH, PRESUMABLY, WAS WRITTEN SOLELY FORLEE’S OWN EDIFICATION, AS IT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED), LEE PENNED A RATHER TELLINGSTATEMENT: “BASICALLY, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A MARTIAL ARTIST BY CHOICE AND ACTORBY PROFESSION. BUT, ABOVE ALL, I AM HOPING TO ACTUALIZE MYSELF TO BE AN ARTISTOF LIFE ALONG THE WAY.”1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_1] “ARTIST OF LIFE” REFERS TOTHE PROCESS OF BEING AN INDIVIDUAL WHO, THROUGH THE USE OF HIS OWN INDEPENDENTJUDGMENT, SOUGHT TO FULLY ACTUALIZE HIMSELF AS A TOTAL HUMAN BEING (I.E.,PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, SPIRITUALLY). MOREOVER, THE “ARTIST OF LIFE” IS WILLING TOBARE HIS SOUL FOR THE PURPOSE OF HONEST COMMUNICATION AND NOT GET CAUGHT UP INSOCIETAL ROLE-PLAYING (SELF-IMAGE CREATION). AS LEE ONCE TOLD JOURNALIST PIERREBERTON, “IT IS EASY FOR ME TO PUT ON A SHOW AND BE COCKY AND THEN FEEL PRETTYCOOL. OR I CAN DO ALL KINDS OF PHONY THINGS AND BE BLINDED BY IT. OR I CAN SHOWYOU SOME REALLY FANCY MOVEMENT. BUT TO EXPRESS ONESELF HONESTLY, NOT LYING TOONESELF—THAT, MY FRIEND, IS VERY HARD TO DO.”2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_2]LEE SOUGHT TO INFUSE THIS PERSPECTIVE INTO EVERYTHING: DEALING WITH FRIENDS,FAMILY MEMBERS, AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATES; CREATING, CHOREOGRAPHING, DIRECTING,AND STARRING IN FILMS; AND WRITING PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISES, PSYCHOLOGY PAPERS,POETIC MUSINGS, AND PERSONAL ESSAYS. HE TOLD INTERVIEWER TED THOMAS: “MY LIFE…SEEMS TO ME TO BE A LIFE OF SELF-EXAMINATION, A PEELING OF MY SELF BIT BY BIT,DAY BY DAY.”3 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_3] THIS IS MOST EVIDENT IN LEE’S WRITING.NO MATTER WHAT THE TOPIC, FROM CHINESE MARTIAL CULTURE TO HEARTFELT POETRY,HERE, WAS A “REAL MAN” WHO WAS LAYING BARE HIS SOUL.ALTHOUGH HE ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, THE BULK OF LEE’S EDUCATIONWAS GAINED INFORMALLY FROM HIS VORACIOUS READING. AS HE LIVED BEFORE THE AGE OFHOME COMPUTERS AND PHOTOCOPIERS, LEE WROTE NOTES, OFTEN VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTIONSIN LONGHAND, FROM PASSAGES HE FOUND BOTH TRUE AND HELPFUL. REVIEWING THEM WOULDINSPIRE HIM TO FURTHER WRITING. THESE WERE HIS PRIVATE JOURNALS, WHERE LEECONTEMPLATED THE THOUGHTS OF MEN AND WOMEN OF LIKE MIND. MANY OF HIS ENTRIES(THE EXCERPTS FROM ERIC HOFFER’S THE PASSIONATE STATE OF MIND AND FREDERICK S.PERLS’ BOOKS ON GESTALT THERAPY, FOR EXAMPLE) HAVE BEEN INCLUDED, TO SHARE SOMEOF LEE’S INFLUENCES AND THE ATTITUDES AND WORLDVIEWS HE FOUND CONGENIAL.IDEAS ENCOUNTERED IN HIS READING OFTEN SURFACED IN HIS PRIVATE MOMENTS. FOREXAMPLE, IN HIS ESSAYS ON ACTING, HE EXPLORES PERLS’ TENETS REGARDINGSELF-ACTUALIZATION VERSUS SELF-IMAGE ACTUALIZATION. FINDING A TRUTH IN ONEDISCIPLINE AND THEN APPLYING THAT TRUTH TO AN ENTIRELY UNRELATED DISCIPLINE IS AHALLMARK OF LEE’S GENIUS: HE SAW THE CONNECTIONS WHERE OTHERS DID NOT. LEE READKRISHNAMURTI AND ALAN WATTS ON SPIRITUALITY AND SAW A DIRECT APPLICATION TO ADIVERGENT ACTIVITY, MARTIAL ARTS. HE ALSO EXAMINED PERLS’ WORK IN PSYCHOLOGY ANDSAW AN APPLICATION, NOT FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSES AND DEPRESSION, BUT FORTRUER AND MORE DYNAMIC ACTING.EVEN THOUGH THESE WERE LEE’S PRIVATE PAPERS NEVER INTENDED FOR PUBLICATION, THEYARE IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS THAT ALLOW US TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF LEE’S BELIEFS ANDART IN CONTEXT. IN ADDITION TO HIS JOURNAL ENTRIES, THIS VOLUME ALSO INCLUDESLEE’S PERSONAL ESSAYS, POEMS, AND PHILOSOPHIC WRITINGS ON A WIDE RANGE OFSUBJECTS. IT IS THEREFORE IRONIC THAT FOR OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY LEE HASBEEN RECOGNIZED PRIMARILY FOR HIS PHYSICAL SKILLS AND TACTICAL PRINCIPLES IN THEART OF UNARMED COMBAT. BUT AS BRUCE LEE, ARTIST OF LIFE REVEALS, SUCH A SHALLOWPERSPECTIVE IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE.LEE WAS EQUAL PARTS POET, PHILOSOPHER, SCIENTIST, ACTOR, PRODUCER, DIRECTOR,AUTHOR, CHOREOGRAPHER, MARTIAL ARTIST, HUSBAND, FATHER, AND FRIEND. HE SOUGHTOUT LIFE IN ALL OF ITS WONDROUS ASPECTS AND WAS ENTHRALLED BY THE PROCESS OFWHAT HE WAS EXPERIENCING. ALWAYS A THINKER, LEE WAS FASCINATED BY THE INSIGHTSINTO SPIRITUAL TRUTHS THAT COULD BE GARNERED THROUGH ADJUSTING THE FOCUS OFHUMAN AWARENESS. THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT IN READING ARTIST OF LIFE YOU NEEDTO FIRST “EMPTY YOUR CUP” ENTIRELY OF THE NOTION OF BRUCE LEE THE MARTIALARTIST, BUT YOU DO NEED TO PREPARE ROOM TO MEET THE COMPLETE BRUCE LEE, THE“ARTIST OF LIFE.”IN THE FUTURE, ALL WHO WISH TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES AS TORCHBEARERS OF LEE’S ARTAND PHILOSOPHY WILL NEED TO KNOW ALL ASPECTS OF THE MAN. THEY WILL AS MUCH NEEDTO KNOW, UNDERSTAND, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, FEEL THE MEANING UNDERLYING LEE’SVARIOUS DRAFTS OF THE ESSAY “IN MY OWN PROCESS,” ALONG WITH THE DEEPER MESSAGEINHERENT IN THE EIGHT DRAFTS OF “TOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION (JEET KUNE DO),” FOREXAMPLE, AS THEY ARE NOW ABLE TO PHYSICALLY RECITE HIS COMBATIVE TECHNIQUES ANDREPEAT HIS MARTIAL MAXIMS.A GREAT ARTIST COMMUNICATES THROUGH ART. LOOKING AT A PAINTING, ONE CANINSTANTLY KNOW WHAT THE ARTIST WAS FEELING AND THINKING WHEN HE PAINTED IT. TIMEHAS NO PLACE HERE, AS THE EMOTION IS AS CLEAR AND DISTINCT AS IF YOU WERE THEARTIST YOURSELF. SIMILARLY, IN LOOKING AT THE BROAD AND COLORFUL STROKES THATLEE PAINTED ACROSS LIFE’S CANVAS, WE ARE ABLE TO INTUIT HIS PERSONALITY, HISPASSION, HIS HEARTFELT CONVICTIONS, HIS VERY SOUL. IF, AS LEE ONCE SAID OF ART,IT IS THE “MUSIC OF THE SOUL MADE VISIBLE,”4 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_4] THENSURELY THIS BOOK IS HIS SYMPHONY.IF YOU READ ARTIST OF LIFE WITH WHAT LEE LIKED TO CALL “QUIET, CHOICELESSAWARENESS,” YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ARE NOT SO MUCH READING A BOOK AS YOU AREVISITING WITH AN OLD FRIEND. AND WHILE BRUCE LEE MAY NO LONGER BE WITH USPHYSICALLY, HE IS STILL ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US VIA THE PRINTED PAGE IN AMANNER THAT TRANSCENDS THE LIMITS OF HUMAN MORTALITY. WHILE APPRECIATING HISCOMPANY, WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE HIS COUNSEL: BECOME “ARTISTS OF LIFE” OURSELVES. WEWOULD BE DOING OUR FRIEND AND OURSELVES THE GRAVEST OF DISSERVICES IF WE SIMPLYPUT HIM ON A PEDESTAL AND ADOPTED HIS WORDS AND BELIEFS AS OUR OWN. IN HISLETTER (INCLUDED IN PART 8 OF THIS BOOK) TO “JOHN,” LEE STATES AS MUCH:> YOU SEE, JOHN,…THAT YOUR WAY OF THINKING IS DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS MINE.> ART, AFTER ALL, IS A MEANS OF ACQUIRING “PERSONAL” LIBERTY. YOUR WAY IS NOT MY> WAY; NOR MINE YOURS. SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET TOGETHER, REMEMBER WELL THAT> ART “LIVES” WHERE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM IS.5 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_5]THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DANGER IN STANDING TOO CLOSE TO THE RIVER OF ANOTHER’STHOUGHTS—THE FASTER THE CURRENT, THE EASIER IT IS TO FALL IN AND BE SWEPT AWAYFROM OURSELVES. INSTEAD, LET US SIMPLY ENJOY WATCHING BRUCE LEE’S THOUGHT AS ITCOURSES THROUGH THESE PAGES, NOTING WHERE IT BENDS AND TURNS AND WHERE IT RAGES,FROTHS, AND BUBBLES WITH GREATEST ENERGY. IF WE PULL BACK AND LOOK AT THESETHOUGHTS FROM OUR OWN VANTAGE, FROM WHERE WE EACH STAND UPON LIFE’S BANK, WE CANSEE THE BIGGER PICTURE—WHAT LEE’S “FINGER” IS POINTING AT. AND IT IS AT THISPOINT—WHERE THE RIVER OF ONE MAN’S THOUGHTS MEETS THE SEA OF HUMANUNDERSTANDING—THAT WE WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO SEE “ALL THAT HEAVENLY GLORY” THATLEE FIRST TOLD US ABOUT OVER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AGO, AND WE CAN DIRECTLYEXPERIENCE THE AWE OF BEING FULLY CONSCIOUS, FULLY HUMAN, FULLY ALIVE, AND FULLYOURSELVES. FOR, AS LEE WISELY OBSERVED, IT IS ONLY IN THE PROCESS OF COMING TOKNOW OURSELVES THAT WE CAN COME TO KNOW ANYTHING.—JOHN LITTLEI CANNOT TEACH YOU; ONLY HELP YOU TO EXPLORE YOURSELF. NOTHING MORE.6[../Text/Notes.xhtml#in1_6]—BRUCE LEE"},{"pageContent":"PART 1GUNG FUImage [../Images/c2.jpg]Image [../Images/2a.jpg]WHEN BRUCE LEE RETURNED TO THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH (AMERICA) FROM HONG KONG AT THEAGE OF EIGHTEEN, BE BROUGHT WITH HIM A VISION OF INTRODUCING THE THENLITTLE-KNOWN CULTURAL ART OF CHINESE GUNG FU TO AMERICA.LEE HAD AT ONE TIME ACTUALLY ENVISIONED ESTABLISHING CHAINS OF GUNG FUINSTITUTES ALL ACROSS AMERICA. HOWEVER, AS HIS KNOWLEDGE EXPANDED WITH AGE, ANDWITH IT HIS PHILOSOPHIC AND MARTIAL EXPERIENCES, HE NO LONGER FELT THE NEED TOEXTOL THE VIRTUES OF TRADITION—HOWEVER VENERATED.THIS IS NOT TO SUGGEST THAT LEE EVER ABANDONED HIS CHINESE HERITAGE ANDPHILOSOPHY; HE SIMPLY OVER TIME CAME TO LOOK FOR THE COMMON ROOT OF HUMANITY, ASOPPOSED TO NATIONALITY, TO JUSTIFY HIS BELIEF SYSTEM AND ACTIONS. EVEN SO, IT ISINTERESTING TO NOTE THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO TAKE CONTROL OVER THE PHILOSOPHYCONTENT OF HIS FILMS IN 1972, THE LESSONS HE REVEALED WERE GLEANED FROM THEEASTERN TRADITIONS.THESE ESSAYS, DEALING EXTENSIVELY WITH CHINESE PHILOSOPHY AND MARTIAL ART WEREWRITTEN IN THE EARLY 1960S. THERE ARE A WONDERFUL REFLECTION OF A YOUNG BRUCELEE’S DRIVING PASSION TO INTRODUCE AND SHARE WITH WESTERNERS THE BEAUTY OF HISCHINESE CULTURE.1-ATHE TAO OF GUNG FU: A STUDY IN THE WAY OF THE CHINESE MARTIAL ARTGUNG FU IS A SPECIAL KIND OF SKILL, A FINE ART RATHER THAN JUST A PHYSICALEXERCISE OR SELF-DEFENSE. TO THE CHINESE, GUNG FU IS THE SUBTLE ART OF MATCHINGTHE ESSENCE OF THE MIND TO THAT OF THE TECHNIQUES IN WHICH IT HAS TO WORK. THEPRINCIPLE OF GUNG FU IS NOT A THING THAT CAN BE LEARNED, LIKE A SCIENCE, BYFACT-FINDING OR INSTRUCTION IN FACTS. IT HAS TO GROW SPONTANEOUSLY, LIKE AFLOWER, IN A MIND FREE FROM DESIRES AND EMOTIONS. THE CORE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OFGUNG FU IS TAO—THE SPONTANEITY OF THE UNIVERSE.THE WORD TAO HAS NO EXACT EQUIVALENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. TO RENDER IT INTOTHE WAY, OR THE “PRINCIPLE” OR THE “LAW” IS TO GIVE IT TOO NARROW ANINTERPRETATION. LAO-TZU, THE FOUNDER OF TAOSIM, DESCRIBED TAO IN THE FOLLOWINGWORDS:> THE WAY THAT CAN BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS IS NOT THE ETERNAL WAY; THE NAME THAT> CAN BE UTTERED IS NOT THE ETERNAL NAME. CONCEIVED OF AS NAMELESS IT IS THE> CAUSE OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. CONCEIVED OF AS HAVING A NAME IT IS THE MOTHER OF> ALL THINGS. ONLY THE MAN ETERNALLY FREE FROM PASSION CAN CONTEMPLATE ITS> SPIRITUAL ESSENCE. HE WHO IS CLOGGED BY DESIRES CAN SEE NO MORE THAN ITS OUTER> FORM. THESE TWO THINGS, THE SPIRITUAL (YIN) AND THE MATERIAL (YANG), THOUGH WE> CALL THEM BY DIFFERENT NAMES, ARE ONE AND THE SAME IN THEIR ORIGIN. THE> SAMENESS IS A MYSTERY OF THE MYSTERIES. IT IS THE GATE OF ALL THAT IS SUBTLE> AND WONDERFUL.1 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_1]IN MASTERPIECES OF WORLD PHILOSOPHY: “TAO IS THE NAMELESS BEGINNING OF THINGS,THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING EVERYTHING, THE SUPREME, ULTIMATE PATTERN,AND THE PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH.”2 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_2] HUSTON SMITH, THEAUTHOR OF THE WORLD’S RELIGIONS, EXPLAINED TAO AS “THE WAY OF ULTIMATEREALITY—THE WAY OR PRINCIPLE BEHIND ALL LIFE, OR THE WAY MAN SHOULD ORDER HISLIFE TO GEAR IN WITH THE WAY THE UNIVERSE OPERATES.”3[../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_3]ALTHOUGH NO ONE WORD CAN SUBSTITUTE ITS MEANING, I HAVE USED THE WORD TRUTH FORIT—THE “TRUTH” BEHIND GUNG FU; THE “TRUTH” THAT EVERY GUNG FU PRACTITIONERSHOULD FOLLOW.TAO OPERATES IN YIN AND YANG, A PAIR OF MUTUALLY COMPLEMENTARY FORCES THAT AREAT WORK IN AND BEHIND ALL PHENOMENA. THIS PRINCIPLE OF YIN-YANG, ALSO KNOWN AST’AI CHI, IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF GUNG FU. THE T’AI CHI, OR GRAND TERMINUS,WAS FIRST DRAWN MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO BY CHOU CHUN I.THE YANG (WHITENESS) PRINCIPLE REPRESENTS POSITIVENESS, FIRMNESS, MASCULINITY,SUBSTANTIALITY, BRIGHTNESS, DAY, HEAT, AND SO FORTH. THE YIN (BLACKNESS)PRINCIPLE IS THE OPPOSITE. IT REPRESENTS NEGATIVENESS, SOFTNESS, FEMININITY,INSUBSTANTIALITY, DARKNESS, NIGHT, COLDNESS, AND SO FORTH. THE BASIC THEORY INT’AI CHI IS THAT NOTHING IS SO PERMANENT AS NEVER TO CHANGE. IN OTHER WORDS,WHEN ACTIVITY (YANG) REACHES THE EXTREME POINT, IT BECOMES INACTIVITY, ANDINACTIVITY FORMS YIN. EXTREME INACTIVITY RETURNS TO BECOME ACTIVITY, WHICH ISYANG. ACTIVITY IS THE CAUSE OF INACTIVITY AND VICE VERSA. THIS SYSTEM OFCOMPLEMENTARY INCREASING AND DECREASING OF THE PRINCIPLE IS CONTINUOUS. FROMTHIS ONE CAN SEE THAT THE TWO FORCES (YIN-YANG), ALTHOUGH THEY APPEAR TOCONFLICT, IN REALITY ARE MUTUALLY INTERDEPENDENT; INSTEAD OF OPPOSITION, THEREIS COOPERATION AND ALTERNATION.THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF YIN-YANG IN GUNG FU ARE EXPRESSED AS THELAW OF HARMONY. IT STATES THAT ONE SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH, NOT IN REBELLIONAGAINST, THE STRENGTH AND FORCE OF THE OPPOSITION. THIS MEANS THAT ONE SHOULD DONOTHING THAT IS NOT NATURAL OR SPONTANEOUS; THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO STRAININ ANY WAY. WHEN OPPONENT A USES STRENGTH (YANG) ON B, B MUST NOT RESIST HIM(BACK) WITH STRENGTH; IN OTHER WORDS, B DOES NOT USE POSITIVENESS (YANG) AGAINSTPOSITIVENESS (YANG), BUT INSTEAD YIELDS TO A WITH SOFTNESS (YIN) AND LEADS A INTHE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN FORCE, NEGATIVENESS (YIN) TO POSITIVENESS (YANG). WHENA’S STRENGTH GOES TO THE EXTREME, THE POSITIVENESS (YANG) WILL CHANGE TONEGATIVENESS (YIN), AND B CAN THEN TAKE HIM AT HIS UNGUARDED MOMENT AND ATTACKWITH FORCE (YANG). THUS THE WHOLE PROCESS IS NOT UNNATURAL OR STRAINED; B FITSHIS MOVEMENT HARMONIOUSLY AND CONTINUOUSLY INTO THAT OF A WITHOUT RESISTING ORSTRIVING.THE ABOVE IDEA GIVES RISE TO A CLOSELY RELATED LAW, THE LAW OF NONINTERFERENCEWITH NATURE, WHICH TEACHES A GUNG FU MAN TO FORGET ABOUT HIMSELF AND FOLLOW HISOPPONENT (STRENGTH) INSTEAD OF HIMSELF; HE DOES NOT MOVE AHEAD BUT RESPONDS TOTHE FITTING INFLUENCE. THE BASIC IDEA IS TO DEFEAT THE OPPONENT BY YIELDING TOHIM AND USING HIS OWN STRENGTH. THAT IS WHY A GUNG FU MAN NEVER ASSERTS HIMSELFAGAINST HIS OPPONENT, AND NEVER PUTS HIMSELF IN FRONTAL OPPOSITION TO THEDIRECTION OF HIS OPPONENT’S FORCE. WHEN BEING ATTACKED, HE WILL NOT RESIST, BUTWILL CONTROL THE ATTACK BY SWINGING WITH IT. THIS LAW ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLESOF NONRESISTANCE AND NONVIOLENCE, WHICH WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT THEBRANCHES OF A FIR TREE SNAP UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE SNOW, WHILE THE SIMPLEREEDS, WEAKER BUT MORE SUPPLE, CAN OVERCOME IT. IN THE I’CHING, CONFUCIUSILLUSTRATED THIS: “TO STAND IN THE STREAM IS A DATUM OF NATURE; ONE MUST FOLLOWAND FLOW WITH IT.”4 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_4] IN THE TAO TEH CHING, THE GOSPELOF TAOISM, LAO-TZU POINTED OUT TO US THE VALUE OF GENTLENESS. CONTRARY TO COMMONBELIEF, THE YIN PRINCIPLE, AS SOFTNESS AND PLIABLENESS, IS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITHLIFE AND SURVIVAL. BECAUSE HE CAN YIELD, A MAN CAN SURVIVE. IN CONTRAST, THEYANG PRINCIPLE, WHICH IS ASSUMED TO BE RIGOROUS AND HARD, MAKES A MAN BREAKUNDER PRESSURE (NOTE THE LAST TWO LINES, WHICH MAKE A FAIR DESCRIPTION OFREVOLUTION AS MANY GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT):> ALIVE, A MAN IS SUPPLE, SOFT;> > IN DEATH, UNBENDING, RIGOROUS.> > ALL CREATURES, GRASS AND TREES, ALIVE> > ARE PLASTIC BUT ARE PLIANT TOO,> > AND DEAD, ARE FRIABLE AND DRY.> > UNBENDING RIGOR IS THE MATE OF DEATH,> > AND YIELDING SOFTNESS, COMPANY OF LIFE;> > UNBENDING SOLDIERS GET NO VICTORIES;> > THE STIFFEST TREE IS READIEST FOR THE AX.> > THE STRONG AND MIGHTY TOPPLE FROM THEIR PLACE;> > THE SOFT AND YIELDING RISE ABOVE THEM ALL.5 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_5]THE WAY OF MOVEMENT IN GUNG FU IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND.IN FACT, THE MIND IS TRAINED TO DIRECT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY. THE MIND WILLSAND THE BODY BEHAVES. AS THE MIND IS TO DIRECT THE BODILY MOVEMENTS, THE WAY TOCONTROL THE MIND IS IMPORTANT; BUT IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK. IN HIS BOOK, GLENCLARK MENTIONED SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES IN ATHLETICS:> EVERY CONFLICTING CENTER, EVERY EXTRANEOUS, DISRUPTING, DECENTRALIZING> EMOTION, JARS THE NATURAL RHYTHM AND REDUCES A MAN’S EFFICIENCY ON THE> GRIDIRON FAR MORE SERIOUSLY THAN PHYSICAL JARS AND BODILY CONFLICTS CAN EVER> JAR HIM. THE EMOTIONS THAT DESTROY THE INNER RHYTHM OF A MAN ARE HATRED,> JEALOUSY, LUST, ENVY, PRIDE, VANITY, COVETOUSNESS AND FEAR.6> [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_6]TO PERFORM THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE IN GUNG FU, PHYSICAL LOOSENING MUST BE CONTINUEDIN A MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL LOOSENING, SO AS TO MAKE THE MIND NOT ONLY AGILE BUTFREE. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, A GUNG FU MAN HAS TO REMAIN QUIET AND CALMAND TO MASTER THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-MINDEDNESS (WUHSIN). NO-MINDEDNESS IS NOT ABLANK MIND THAT EXCLUDES ALL EMOTIONS; NOR IS IT SIMPLY CALMNESS AND QUIETNESSOF MIND. ALTHOUGH QUIETUDE AND CALMNESS ARE IMPORTANT, IT IS THE“NON-GRASPINGNESS” OF THE MIND THAT MAINLY CONSTITUTES THE PRINCIPLE OFNO-MINDEDNESS. A GUNG FU MAN EMPLOYS HIS MIND AS A MIRROR—IT GRASPS NOTHING ANDIT REFUSES NOTHING; IT RECEIVES BUT DOES NOT KEEP. AS ALAN WATTS PUTS IT, THENO-MINDEDNESS IS “A STATE OF WHOLENESS IN WHICH THE MIND FUNCTIONS FREELY ANDEASILY, WITHOUT THE SENSATION OF A SECOND MIND OR EGO STANDING OVER IT WITH ACLUB.”7 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_7]WHAT HE MEANS IS, LET THE MIND THINK WHAT IT LIKES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE BY THESEPARATE THINKER OR EGO WITHIN ONESELF. SO LONG AS IT THINKS WHAT IT WANTS,THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT IN LETTING IT GO; AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THEEFFORT TO LET GO IS PRECISELY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SEPARATE THINKER. THEREIS NOTHING TO TRY TO DO, FOR WHATEVER COMES UP MOMENT BY MOMENT IS ACCEPTED,INCLUDING NONACCEPTANCE. NO-MINDEDNESS IS THEN NOT BEING WITHOUT EMOTION ORFEELING, BUT BEING ONE IN WHOM FEELING IS NOT STICKY OR BLOCKED. IT IS A MINDIMMUNE TO EMOTIONAL INFLUENCES. “LIKE THIS RIVER, EVERYTHING IS FLOWING ONCEASELESSLY WITHOUT CESSATION OR STANDING STILL.”8 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_8]NO-MINDEDNESS IS EMPLOYING THE WHOLE MIND AS WE USE THE EYES WHEN WE REST THEMUPON VARIOUS OBJECTS BUT MAKE NO SPECIAL EFFORT TO TAKE ANYTHING IN. CHUANG-TZU,THE DISCIPLE OF LAO-TZU, STATED:> THE BABY LOOKS AT THINGS ALL DAY WITHOUT WINKING, THAT IS BECAUSE HIS EYES ARE> NOT FOCUSED ON ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT. HE GOES WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE IS> GOING, AND STOPS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE IS DOING. HE MERGES HIMSELF WITH THE> SURROUNDINGS AND MOVES ALONG WITH IT. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF MENTAL> HYGIENE.9 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_9]THEREFORE, CONCENTRATION IN GUNG FU DOES NOT HAVE THE USUAL SENSE OF RESTRICTINGTHE ATTENTION TO A SINGLE SENSE OBJECT; IT IS SIMPLY A QUIET AWARENESS OFWHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE HERE AND NOW. SUCH CONCENTRATION CAN BE ILLUSTRATED BY ANAUDIENCE AT A FOOTBALL GAME; INSTEAD OF A CONCENTRATED ATTENTION ON THE PLAYERWHO HAS THE BALL, THEY HAVE AN AWARENESS OF THE WHOLE FOOTBALL FIELD. IN ASIMILAR WAY, A GUNG FU MAN’S MIND IS CONCENTRATED BY NOT DWELLING ON ANYPARTICULAR PART OF THE OPPONENT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN HE DEALS WITH MANYOPPONENTS. FOR INSTANCE, SUPPOSE TEN MEN ARE ATTACKING HIM, EACH IN SUCCESSIONREADY TO STRIKE HIM DOWN. AS SOON AS ONE IS DISPOSED OF, HE WILL MOVE ON TOANOTHER WITHOUT PERMITTING THE MIND TO “STOP” WITH ANY. HOWEVER RAPIDLY ONE BLOWMAY FOLLOW ANOTHER HE LEAVES NO TIME TO INTERVENE BETWEEN THE TWO. EVERY ONE OFTHE TEN WILL THUS BE SUCCESSIVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH. THIS IS POSSIBLEONLY WHEN THE MIND MOVES FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING “STOPPED” ORARRESTED BY ANYTHING. IF THE MIND IS UNABLE TO MOVE ON IN THIS FASHION, IT ISSURE TO LOSE THE COMBAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO ENCOUNTERS.THE MIND IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE ATTACHED TO ANY PARTICULAROBJECT. AND IT CAN REMAIN PRESENT BECAUSE, EVEN WHEN RELATING TO THIS OR THATOBJECT, IT DOES NOT CLING TO IT. THE FLOW OF THOUGHT IS LIKE WATER FILLING APOND, WHICH IS ALWAYS READY TO FLOW OFF AGAIN. IT CAN WORK ITS INEXHAUSTIBLEPOWER BECAUSE IT IS FREE, AND IT CAN BE OPEN TO EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT IS EMPTY.THIS CAN BE COMPARED WITH WHAT CHANG CHEN CHI CALLED “SERENE REFLECTION.” HEWROTE: “SERENE MEANS TRANQUILLITY OF NO THOUGHT, AND REFLECTION MEANS VIVID ANDCLEAR AWARENESS. THEREFORE, SERENE REFLECTION IS CLEAR AWARENESS OFNO-THOUGHT.”10 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_10][../Images/7a.jpg]AS STATED EARLIER, A GUNG FU MAN AIMS AT HARMONY WITH HIMSELF AND HIS OPPONENT.ALSO, BEING IN HARMONY WITH ONE’S OPPONENT IS POSSIBLE NOT THROUGH FORCE, WHICHPROVOKES CONFLICTS AND REACTIONS, BUT THROUGH A YIELDING TO THE OPPONENT’SFORCE. IN OTHER WORDS, A GUNG FU MAN PROMOTES THE SPONTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT OF HISOPPONENT AND DOES NOT VENTURE TO INTERFERE BY HIS OWN ACTION. HE LOSES HIMSELFBY GIVING UP ALL SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS AND INDIVIDUALITY, AND HE BECOMES ONE WITHHIS OPPONENT. INSIDE HIS MIND, OPPOSITIONS HAVE BECOME MUTUALLY COOPERATIVEINSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. WHEN HIS PRIVATE EGOS AND CONSCIOUS EFFORTS YIELDTO A POWER NOT HIS OWN HE THEN ACHIEVES THE SUPREME ACTION, NONACTION (WU WEI).WU MEANS “NOT” OR “NON” AND WEI MEANS “ACTION,” “DOING,” “STRIVING,”“STRAINING,” OR “BUSYNESS.” WU WEI DOESN’T REALLY MEAN DOING NOTHING, BUTLETTING ONE’S MIND ALONE, TRUSTING IT TO WORK BY ITSELF. WU WEI, IN GUNG FU,MEANS SPONTANEOUS ACTION OR SPIRIT-ACTION, IN THE SENSE THAT THE GOVERNING FORCEIS THE MIND AND NOT THE SENSES. DURING SPARRING, A GUNG FU MAN LEARNS TO FORGETABOUT HIMSELF AND FOLLOW THE MOVEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT, LEAVING HIS MIND FREE TOMAKE ITS OWN COUNTERMOVEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTERFERING DELIBERATION. HE FREESHIMSELF FROM ALL MENTAL SUGGESTIONS OF RESISTANCE AND ADOPTS A SUPPLE ATTITUDE.HIS ACTIONS ARE ALL PERFORMED WITHOUT SELF-ASSERTION; HE LETS HIS MIND REMAINSPONTANEOUS AND UNGRASPED. AS SOON AS HE STOPS TO THINK, HIS FLOW OF MOVEMENTWILL BE DISTURBED AND HIS OPPONENT WILL IMMEDIATELY STRIKE HIM. EVERY ACTIONTHEREFORE HAS TO BE DONE “UNINTENTIONALLY” WITHOUT EVER “TRYING.”THROUGH WU WEI, A “REPOSEFUL EASE” IS SECURED. THIS PASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT, ASCHUANG-TZU POINTED OUT, WILL FREE A GUNG FU MAN FROM STRIVING AND STRAININGHIMSELF:> A YIELDING WILL HAS A RESPOSEFUL EASE, SOFT AS DOWNY FEATHERS,> A QUIETUDE, A SHRINKING FROM ACTION, AN APPEARANCE OF INABILITY TO DO.> PLACIDLY FREE FROM ANXIETY, ONE ACTS> WITH THE OPPORTUNE TIME; ONE MOVES AND REVOLVES IN THE LINE> OF CREATION. ONE DOES NOT MOVE AHEAD BUT RESPONDS TO THE FITTING INFLUENCES.> ESTABLISH NOTHING IN REGARD TO ONESELF. LET THINGS BE> WHAT THEY ARE, MOVE LIKE WATER, REST LIKE A MIRROR,> RESPOND LIKE AN ECHO, PASS QUICKLY LIKE THE NONEXISTENT,> AND BE QUIET AS PURITY. THOSE WHO GAIN, LOSE. DO NOT> PRECEDE OTHERS, ALWAYS FOLLOW THEM.11 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_11]THE NATURAL PHENOMENON WHICH THE GUNG FU MAN SEES AS BEING THE CLOSESTRESEMBLANCE TO WU WEI IS WATER:> NOTHING IS WEAKER THAN WATER,> BUT WHEN IT ATTACKS SOMETHING HARD> OR RESISTANT, THEN NOTHING WITHSTANDS IT,> AND NOTHING WILL ALTER ITS WAY.12 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_12]THE ABOVE PASSAGES FROM THE TAO TE CHING ILLUSTRATE TO US THE NATURE OF WATER:WATER IS SO FINE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT; STRIKE IT, YETIT DOES NOT SUFFER HURT; STAB IT, AND IT IS NOT WOUNDED; SEVER IT, YET IT IS NOTDIVIDED. IT HAS NO SHAPE OF ITS OWN BUT MOLDS ITSELF TO THE RECEPTACLE THATCONTAINS IT. WHEN HEATED TO THE STATE OF STEAM IT IS INVISIBLE BUT HAS ENOUGHPOWER TO SPLIT THE EARTH ITSELF. WHEN FROZEN IT CRYSTALLIZES INTO A MIGHTY ROCK.FIRST IT IS TURBULENT LIKE NIAGARA FALLS, AND THEN CALM LIKE A STILL POND,FEARFUL LIKE A TORRENT, AND REFRESHING LIKE A SPRING ON A HOT SUMMER’S DAY. SOIS THE PRINCIPLE OF WU WEI:> THE RIVERS AND SEAS ARE LORDS OF A HUNDRED VALLEYS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEIR> STRENGTH IS IN LOWLINESS; THEY ARE KINGS OF THEM ALL. SO IT IS THAT THE> PERFECT MASTER WISHING TO LEAD THEM, HE FOLLOWS. THUS, THOUGH HE IS ABOVE> THEM, HE FOLLOWS. THUS, THOUGH HE IS ABOVE THEM, MEN DO NOT FEEL HIM TO BE AN> INJURY. AND SINCE HE WILL NOT STRIVE, NONE STRIVE WITH HIM. 13> [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_13]THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE SOMEBODY OR TO GIVETROUBLE. THEY WANT TO GET AHEAD, TO STAND OUT. SUCH AMBITION HAS NO USE FOR AGUNG FU MAN, WHO REJECTS ALL FORMS OF SELF-ASSERTIVENESS AND COMPETITION:[../Images/10a.jpg]> ONE WHO TRIES TO STAND ON TIPTOE CANNOT STAND STILL.

ERIC HOFFER, “IS A SENSE OF WORTH THAT DERIVES FROM SOMETHING THAT IS NOTORGANICALLY PART OF ONESELF.”16 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_16] PRIDE EMPHASIZESTHE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUPERIORITY OF A PERSON’S STATUS IN THE EYES OF OTHERS.THERE IS FEAR AND INSECURITY IN PRIDE BECAUSE WHEN A PERSON AIMS AT BEING HIGHLYESTEEMED AND ACHIEVES SUCH STATUS, HE IS AUTOMATICALLY INVOLVED IN THE FEAR OFLOSING HIS STATUS. THEN PROTECTION OF HIS STATUS APPEARS TO BE HIS MOSTIMPORTANT NEED, AND THIS CREATES ANXIETY. MR. HOFFER FURTHER STATES THAT: “THELESS PROMISE AND POTENCY IN THE SELF, THE MORE IMPERATIVE IS THE NEED FOR PRIDE.ONE IS PROUD WHEN HE IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH AN IMAGINARY SELF; THE CORE OFPRIDE IS SELF-REJECTION.”17 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_17]AS WE KNOW, GUNG FU IS AIMING AT SELF-CULTIVATION, AND THE INNER SELF IS ONE’STRUE SELF. SO IN ORDER TO REALIZE HIS TRUE SELF, A GUNG FU MAN LIVES WITHOUTBEING DEPENDENT UPON THE OPINION OF OTHERS. SINCE HE IS COMPLETELYSELF-SUFFICIENT HE CAN HAVE NO FEAR OF NOT BEING ESTEEMED. A GUNG FU MAN DEVOTESHIMSELF TO BEING SELF-SUFFICIENT AND NEVER DEPENDS UPON THE EXTERNAL RATING BYOTHERS FOR HIS HAPPINESS. A GUNG FU MASTER, UNLIKE THE BEGINNER, HOLDS HIMSELFIN RESERVE, IS QUIET AND UNASSUMING, WITHOUT THE LEAST DESIRE TO SHOW OFF. UNDERTHE INFLUENCE OF GUNG FU TRAINING HIS PROFICIENCY BECOMES SPIRITUAL, AND HEHIMSELF, GROWN EVER FREER THROUGH SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE, IS TRANSFORMED. TO HIM,FAME AND STATUS MEAN NOTHING.THUS WU WEI IS THE ART OF ARTLESSNESS, THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-PRINCIPLE. TO STATEIT IN TERMS OF GUNG FU, THE GENUINE BEGINNER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE WAY OFBLOCKING AND STRIKING, AND MUCH LESS ABOUT HIS CONCERN FOR HIMSELF. WHEN ANOPPONENT TRIES TO STRIKE HIM, HE “INSTINCTIVELY” PARRIES IT. THIS IS ALL HE CANDO. BUT AS SOON AS HIS TRAINING STARTS, HE IS TAUGHT HOW TO DEFEND AND ATTACK,WHERE TO KEEP THE MIND, AND MANY OTHER TECHNICAL TRICKS—WHICH MAKES HIS MIND“STOP” AT VARIOUS JUNCTURES. FOR THIS REASON WHENEVER HE TRIES TO STRIKE THEOPPONENT HE FEELS UNUSUALLY HAMPERED (HE HAS LOST ALTOGETHER THE ORIGINAL SENSEOF INNOCENCE AND FREEDOM). BUT AS MONTHS AND YEARS GO BY, AS HIS TRAININGACQUIRES FULLER MATURITY, HIS BODILY ATTITUDE AND HIS WAY OF MANAGING THETECHNIQUE TOWARD NO-MINDEDNESS COME TO RESEMBLE THE STATE OF MIND HE HAD AT THEVERY BEGINNING OF TRAINING WHEN HE KNEW NOTHING, WHEN HE WAS ALTOGETHER IGNORANTOF THE ART. THE BEGINNING AND THE END THUS TURN INTO NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS. IN THEMUSICAL SCALE, ONE MAY START WITH THE LOWEST PITCH AND GRADUALLY ASCEND TO THEHIGHEST. WHEN THE HIGHEST IS REACHED, ONE FINDS IT IS LOCATED NEXT TO THELOWEST.IN A SIMILAR WAY, WHEN THE HIGHEST STAGE IS REACHED IN THE STUDY OF TAOISTTEACHING, A GUNG FU MAN TURNS INTO A KIND OF SIMPLETON WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF TAO,NOTHING OF ITS TEACHINGS, AND IS DEVOID OF ALL LEARNING. INTELLECTUALCALCULATIONS ARE LOST SIGHT OF AND A STATE OF NO-MINDEDNESS PREVAILS. WHEN THEULTIMATE PERFECTION IS ATTAINED, THE BODY AND LIMBS PERFORM BY THEMSELVES WHATIS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO DO WITH NO INTERFERENCE FROM THE MIND. THE TECHNICALSKILL IS SO AUTOMATIC IT IS COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM CONSCIOUS EFFORTS.THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CHINESE HYGIENE AND THE WESTERN HYGIENE.SOME OF THE OBVIOUS ONES ARE CHINESE EXERCISE IS RHYTHMIC, WHEREAS THE WESTERNIS DYNAMIC AND FULL OF TENSION; THE CHINESE EXERCISE SEEKS TO MERGE HARMONIOUSLYWITH NATURE, WHEREAS THE WESTERN DOMINATES IT; THE CHINESE EXERCISE IS BOTH AWAY OF LIFE AND A MENTAL CULTIVATION, WHILE THE WESTERN EXERCISE IS MERELY ASPORT OR A PHYSICAL CALISTHENIC.PERHAPS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE FACT THAT CHINESE HYGIENE IS YIN (SOFTNESS),WHILE WESTERN IS YANG (POSITIVENESS). WE CAN COMPARE THE WESTERN MIND WITH ANOAK TREE THAT STANDS FIRM AND RIGID AGAINST THE STRONG WIND. WHEN THE WINDBECOMES STRONGER, THE OAK TREE CRACKS. THE CHINESE MIND, ON THE OTHER HAND, ISLIKE THE BAMBOO THAT BENDS WITH THE STRONG WIND. WHEN THE WIND CEASES (THAT IS,WHEN IT GOES TO THE EXTREME AND CHANGES), THE BAMBOO SPRINGS BACK STRONGER THANBEFORE.WESTERN HYGIENE IS A GRATUITOUS WASTE OF ENERGY. THE OVEREXERTION ANDOVERDEVELOPMENT OF BODILY ORGANS INVOLVED IN WESTERN ATHLETICS IS DETRIMENTAL TOONE’S HEALTH. CHINESE HYGIENE, ON THE OTHER HAND, THROWS ITS EMPHASIS ONCONSERVATION OF ENERGY; THE PRINCIPLE IS ALWAYS THAT OF MODERATION WITHOUT GOINGTO THE EXTREME. WHATEVER EXERCISE THERE MAY BE CONSISTS OF HARMONIOUS MOVEMENTSCALCULATED TO NORMALIZE BUT NOT TO EXCITE ONE’S BODILY REGIMEN. IT STARTS OUTWITH A MENTAL REGIMEN AS A BASIS, IN WHICH THE SOLE OBJECT IS TO BRING ABOUTPEACE AND CALMNESS OF MIND. WITH THIS AS A BASIS, IT AIMS AT STIMULATING THENORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERNAL PROCESS OF RESPIRATION AND BLOOD CIRCULATION.SOURCE: HANDWRITTEN ESSAY BY BRUCE LEE ENTITLED “THE TAO OF GUNG FU: A STUDY INTHE WAY OF THE CHINESE MARTIAL ART,” DATED MAY 16, 1962. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.1-BGUNG FU: THE CENTER OF THE ORIENTAL ARTSGUNG FU, THE CENTER OF THE ORIENTAL ARTS OF SELF-DEFENSE, IS A PHILOSOPHICAL ARTTHAT SERVES TO PROMOTE HEALTH, TO CULTIVATE THE MIND, AND TO PROVIDE A MOSTEFFICIENT MEANS OF SELF-PROTECTION.ITS PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE PHILOSOPHIES OF TAOISM ANDCH’AN (ZEN)—THE IDEAL OF BEING HARMONIOUS WITH AND NOT AGAINST THE FORCE OF THEOPPONENT. JUST AS A BUTCHER PRESERVES HIS KNIFE BY CUTTING ALONG THE BONES, AGUNG FU MAN PRESERVES HIMSELF BY COMPLEMENTING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE OPPONENT.[../Images/13a.jpg]THE WORD GUNG FU MEANS “DISCIPLINE” AND “TRAINING” TOWARD THE ULTIMATE REALITYOF THE OBJECT—BE IT HEALTH PROMOTION, MIND CULTIVATION OR SELF-PROTECTION. THEREIS NO DISTINCTION TO MAKE BETWEEN THE OPPONENT AND THE SELF BECAUSE THE OPPONENTIS BUT THE OTHER COMPLEMENTARY (NOT OPPOSITE) PART. THERE IS NO CONQUERING,STRUGGLING, OR DOMINATING, AND THE IDEA IS TO “FIT” HARMONIOUSLY YOUR MOVEMENTINTO THAT OF THE OPPONENT. WHEN HE EXPANDS, YOU CONTRACT; WHEN HE CONTRACTS, YOUEXPAND. EXPANSION THEN IS INTERDEPENDENT WITH CONTRACTION AND VICE VERSA, EACHBEING THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER.GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS IS ONE INSEPARABLE FORCE OF ONE UNCEASING INTERPLAY OFMOVEMENT. IF A PERSON RIDING A BICYCLE WISHES TO GO SOMEWHERE, HE CANNOT PUMP ONBOTH THE PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME OR NOT PUMP ON THEM AT ALL. IN ORDER TO MOVEFORWARD HE HAS TO PUMP ON ONE PEDAL AND RELEASE THE OTHER. SO THE MOVEMENT OFGOING FORWARD REQUIRES THIS “ONENESS” OF PUMPING AND RELEASING. THEREFORE,GENTLENESS ALONE CANNOT FOREVER DISSOLVE AWAY GREAT FORCE, NOR CAN SHEER BRUTEFORCE SUBDUE ONE’S FOE. IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN ANY COMBAT, THE HARMONIOUSINTERFUSION OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS AS A WHOLE IS NECESSARY, SOMETIMES ONEDOMINATING SOMETIMES THE OTHER, IN A WAVELIKE SUCCESSION. THE MOVEMENT WILL THENTRULY FLOW, FOR THE PURE FLUIDITY OF MOVEMENTS IS IN THEIR INTERCHANGEABILITY.SO NEITHER GENTLENESS NOR FIRMNESS HOLDS ANY MORE THAN ONE HALF OF A BROKENWHOLE WHICH, WELDED TOGETHER, FORMS THE TRUE WAY OF MARTIAL ART. THE TENDENCY TOGUARD AGAINST IS FROM GETTING TOO FIRM AND STIFF. NOTICE THAT THE STIFFEST TREEIS MOST EASILY CRACKED, WHILE THE BAMBOO OR WILLOW SURVIVES BY BENDING WITH THEWIND. THIS IS WHY A GUNG FU MAN IS SOFT YET NOT YIELDING, FIRM, YET NOT HARD.THE BEST EXAMPLE OF GUNG FU IS WATER. WATER CAN PENETRATE THE HARDEST GRANITEBECAUSE IT IS YIELDING. ONE CANNOT STAB OR STRIKE AT WATER AND HURT IT BECAUSETHAT WHICH OFFERS NO RESISTANCE CANNOT BE OVERCOME.IN ACTUAL APPLICATION, GUNG FU IS BASED ON SIMPLICITY; IT IS A NATURAL RESULT OFFOUR THOUSAND YEARS OF EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTATION AND IS OF HIGHLY SOPHISTICATEDCOMPLEXITY. ALL TECHNIQUES ARE STRIPPED DOWN TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE WITHOUTWASTAGE OR ORNAMENTATION, AND EVERYTHING BECOMES THE STRAIGHTEST, MOST LOGICALSIMPLICITY OF COMMON SENSE. THE UTMOST IS EXPRESSED AND PERFORMED IN THE MINIMUMOF MOVEMENTS AND ENERGY.THE METHOD FOR HEALTH PROMOTION IS AGAIN BASED ON WATER, AS FLOWING WATER NEVERGROWS STALE. THE IDEA IS NOT TO OVERDEVELOP OR TO OVEREXERT BUT TO NORMALIZE THEFUNCTION OF THE BODY.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ON GUNG FU, UNTITLED.

MY ONLY THOUGHT AT THIS POINT WAS “SOMEHOW OROTHER I MUST BEAT HIM AND WIN!”MY INSTRUCTOR AT THE TIME, PROFESSOR YIP MAN, HEAD OF THE WING CHUN SCHOOL OFGUNG FU, WOULD COME UP TO ME AND SAY “LOONG,18 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_18]RELAX AND CALM YOUR MIND. FORGET ABOUT YOURSELF AND FOLLOW THE OPPONENT’SMOVEMENT. LET YOUR MIND, THE BASIC REALITY, DO THE COUNTER-MOVEMENT WITHOUT ANYINTERFERING DELIBERATION.

THAT OCCURRED AT THE PRECISE MOMENTI SAID, “I MUST RELAX.” THE DEMAND FOR EFFORT IN MUST WAS ALREADY INCONSISTENTWITH THE EFFORTLESSNESS IN RELAX.WHEN MY ACUTE SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS GREW TO WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGISTS REFER TO AS THE“DOUBLE-BIND” TYPE, MY INSTRUCTOR WOULD AGAIN APPROACH ME AND SAY, “LOONG,PRESERVE YOURSELF BY FOLLOWING THE NATURAL BENDS OF THINGS AND DON’T INTERFERE.REMEMBER NEVER TO ASSERT YOURSELF AGAINST NATURE; NEVER BE IN FRONTAL OPPOSITIONTO ANY PROBLEMS, BUT CONTROL IT BY SWINGING WITH IT. DON’T PRACTICE THIS WEEK.GO HOME AND THINK ABOUT IT.”THE FOLLOWING WEEK I STAYED HOME. AFTER SPENDING MANY HOURS MEDITATING ANDPRACTICING, I GAVE UP AND WENT SAILING ALONE IN A JUNK. ON THE SEA I THOUGHT OFALL MY PAST TRAINING AND GOT MAD AT MYSELF AND PUNCHED THE WATER! RIGHT THEN—ATTHAT MOMENT—A THOUGHT SUDDENLY STRUCK ME; WAS NOT THIS WATER THE VERY ESSENCE OFGUNG FU? HADN’T THIS WATER JUST NOW ILLUSTRATED TO ME THE PRINCIPLE OF GUNG FU?I STRUCK IT BUT IT DID NOT SUFFER HURT. AGAIN I STRUCK IT WITH ALL OF MYMIGHT—YET IT WAS NOT WOUNDED! I THEN TRIED TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT BUT THISPROVED IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WATER, THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD, WHICH COULDBE CONTAINED IN THE SMALLEST JAR, ONLY SEEMED WEAK. IN REALITY, IT COULDPENETRATE THE HARDEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD. THAT WAS IT! I WANTED TO BE LIKETHE NATURE OF WATER.SUDDENLY A BIRD FLEW BY AND CAST ITS REFLECTION ON THE WATER. RIGHT THEN AS IWAS ABSORBING MYSELF WITH THE LESSON OF THE WATER, ANOTHER MYSTIC SENSE OFHIDDEN MEANING REVEALED ITSELF TO ME; SHOULD NOT THE THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS I HADWHEN IN FRONT OF AN OPPONENT PASS LIKE THE REFLECTION OF THE BIRD FLYING OVERTHE WATER? THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT PROFESSOR YIP MEANT BY BEING DETACHED—NOT BEINGWITHOUT EMOTION OR FEELING, BUT BEING ONE IN WHOM FEELING WAS NOT STICKY ORBLOCKED. THEREFORE IN ORDER TO CONTROL MYSELF I MUST FIRST ACCEPT MYSELF BYGOING WITH AND NOT AGAINST MY NATURE.I LAY ON THE BOAT AND FELT THAT I HAD UNITED WITH TAO; I HAD BECOME ONE WITHNATURE. I JUST LAY THERE AND LET THE BOAT DRIFT FREELY ACCORDING TO ITS OWNWILL. FOR AT THAT MOMENT I HAD ACHIEVED A STATE OF INNER FEELING IN WHICHOPPOSITION HAD BECOME MUTUALLY COOPERATIVE INSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, INWHICH THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY CONFLICT IN MY MIND. THE WHOLE WORLD TO ME WASUNITARY.THIS WATER, THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD, WHICH COULD BE CONTAINED IN THESMALLEST JAR, ONLY SEEMED WEAK. IN REALITY, IT COULD PENETRATE THE HARDESTSUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD. THAT WAS IT!

IT IS SIMPLYTHE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF ONE’S FEELING WITH THE MINIMUM OF LINES AND ENERGY.EVERY MOVEMENT IS BEING SO OF ITSELF WITHOUT THE ARTIFICIALITY WITH WHICH WETEND TO COMPLICATE THEM. THE CLOSER TO THE TRUE WAY OF GUNG FU, THE LESS WASTAGEOF EXPRESSION THERE IS.[../Images/18a.jpg]GUNG FU IS TO BE LOOKED AT WITHOUT FANCY SUITS AND MATCHING TIES, AND IT REMAINSA SECRET WHILE WE ANXIOUSLY LOOK FOR SOPHISTICATION AND DEADLY TECHNIQUES. IFTHERE ARE REALLY ANY SECRETS AT ALL, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN MISSED BY THE “SEEING”AND “STRIVING” OF ITS PRACTITIONERS (AFTER ALL, HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE TO COMEIN ON AN OPPONENT WITHOUT DEVIATING TOO MUCH FROM THE NATURAL COURSE?). GUNG FUVALUES THE WONDER OF THE ORDINARY, AND THE IDEA IS NOT DAILY INCREASE BUT DAILYDECREASE.BEING WISE IN GUNG FU DOES NOT MEAN ADDING MORE BUT BEING ABLE TO REMOVESOPHISTICATION AND ORNAMENTATION AND BE SIMPLY SIMPLE—LIKE A SCULPTOR BUILDING ASTATUE NOT BY ADDING, BUT BY HACKING AWAY THE UNESSENTIAL SO THAT THE TRUTH WILLBE REVEALED UN-OBSTRUCTED. GUNG FU IS SATISFIED WITH ONE’S BARE HANDS WITHOUTTHE FANCY DECORATION OF COLORFUL GLOVES, WHICH TEND TO HINDER THE NATURALFUNCTION OF THE HANDS. THE HEIGHT OF CULTIVATION ALWAYS RUNS TO SIMPLICITY WHILEHALFWAY CULTIVATION RUNS TO ORNAMENTATION.THERE ARE THREE STAGES IN THE CULTIVATION OF GUNG FU: NAMELY, THE PRIMITIVESTAGE, THE STAGE OF ART, AND THE STAGE OF ARTLESSNESS. THE PRIMITIVE STAGE ISTHE STAGE OF ORIGINAL IGNORANCE IN WHICH A PERSON KNOWS NOTHING OF THE ART OFCOMBAT. IN A FIGHT HE “SIMPLY” BLOCKS AND STRIKES INSTINCTIVELY WITHOUT CONCERNAS FOR WHAT IS RIGHT AND WRONG. OF COURSE, HE MIGHT NOT BE SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC,BUT HE IS, NEVERTHELESS, BEING HIMSELF.THE SECOND STAGE, THE STAGE OF ART, BEGINS WHEN A PERSON STARTS HIS TRAINING. HEIS TAUGHT THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF BLOCKING AND STRIKING, THE VARIOUS WAYS OFKICKING, OF STANDING, OF MOVING, OF BREATHING, OF THINKING. UNQUESTIONABLY HE ISGAINING A SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF COMBAT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HIS ORIGINAL SELFAND SENSE OF FREEDOM ARE LOST, AND HIS ACTION NO LONGER FLOWS BY ITSELF. HISMIND TENDS TO FREEZE AT DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS FOR CALCULATION AND ANALYSIS. EVENWORSE, HE MIGHT BE “INTELLECTUALLY BOUND” AND MAINTAINING HIMSELF OUTSIDE THEACTUAL REALITY.THE THIRD STAGE, THE STAGE OF ARTLESSNESS, OCCURS WHEN, AFTER YEARS OF SERIOUSAND HARD PRACTICE, HE REALIZES THAT, AFTER ALL, GUNG FU IS NOTHING SPECIAL ANDINSTEAD OF TRYING TO IMPOSE HIS MIND ON THE ART, HE ADJUSTS HIMSELF TO THEOPPONENT LIKE WATER PRESSING ON AN EARTHEN WALL—IT FLOWS THROUGH THE SLIGHTESTCRACK. THERE IS NOTHING TO “TRY” TO DO BUT BE PURPOSELESS AND FORMLESS LIKEWATER. NOTHINGNESS PREVAILS; HE NO LONGER IS CONFINED.THESE THREE STAGES ALSO APPLY TO THE VARIOUS METHODS BEING PRACTICED IN CHINESEGUNG FU. SOME METHODS ARE RATHER PRIMITIVE WITH BASIC JERKY BLOCKING ANDSTRIKING. ON THE WHOLE, THEY LACK THE FLOW AND CHANGE OF COMBINATIONS. SOME“SOPHISTICATED” METHODS, ON THE OTHER HAND, TEND TO RUN TO ORNAMENTATION AND GETCARRIED AWAY BY GRACE AND SHOWMANSHIP. WHETHER FROM THE SO-CALLED “FIRM” OR“GENTLE” SCHOOL, THEY OFTEN INVOLVE BIG, FANCY MOVEMENTS WITH A LOT OFCOMPLICATED STEPS TOWARD ONE SINGLE GOAL (IT IS LIKE AN ARTIST WHO, NOTSATISFIED WITH DRAWING A SIMPLE SNAKE, PROCEEDS TO PUT FOUR BEAUTIFUL ANDSHAPELY FEET ON THE SNAKE).WHEN GRASPED BY THE COLLAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THESE PRACTITIONERS WOULD “FIRST DOTHIS, THEN THIS, AND FINALLY THAT”—BUT OF COURSE THE DIRECT WAY WOULD BE TO LETTHE OPPONENT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF GRASPING THE COLLAR (HE IS GRASPING IT ANYWAY)AND SIMPLY PUNCH HIM STRAIGHT ON THE NOSE! TO SOME MARTIAL ARTISTS OFDISTINGUISHING TASTE, THIS WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT UNSOPHISTICATED; TOO ORDINARYAND UNARTFUL. HOWEVER, IT IS THE ORDINARY THAT WE USE AND ENCOUNTER IN EVERYDAYLIFE.ART IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SELF; THE MORE COMPLICATED AND RESTRICTIVE A METHODIS, THE LESS OPPORTUNITY THERE IS FOR EXPRESSION OF ONE’S ORIGINAL SENSE OFFREEDOM. THE TECHNIQUES, ALTHOUGH THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EARLIERSTAGE, SHOULD NOT BE TOO COMPLEX, RESTRICTIVE, OR MECHANICAL. IF WE CLING TOTHEM WE WILL BECOME BOUND BY THEIR LIMITATIONS.REMEMBER THAT MAN CREATED METHOD, AND METHOD DID NOT CREATE MAN, AND DO NOTSTRAIN YOURSELF IN TWISTING INTO SOMEONE’S PRECONCEIVED PATTERN, WHICHUNQUESTIONABLY WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR HIM, BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR YOU. YOUYOURSELF ARE “EXPRESSING” THE TECHNIQUE AND NOT “DOING” THE TECHNIQUE; IN FACT,THERE IS NO DOER BUT THE ACTION ITSELF. WHEN SOMEONE ATTACKS YOU, IT IS NOTTECHNIQUE NUMBER ONE (OR IS IT “TECHNIQUE NUMBER TWO?”) THAT YOU USE, BUT THEMOMENT YOU’RE AWARE OF HIS ATTACK YOU SIMPLY MOVE IN LIKE SOUND, AN ECHO WITHOUTANY DELIBERATION. IT IS AS THOUGH WHEN I CALL, YOU ANSWER ME, OR WHEN I THROWSOMETHING, YOU CATCH IT. THAT’S ALL.AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OF PRACTICE IN THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS I HAVE FOUND OUTTHIS: THAT TECHNIQUES ARE MERELY SIMPLE GUIDE LINES TO TELL THE PRACTITIONERTHAT HE HAS DONE ENOUGH! OF COURSE, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT PREFERENCESAND THEREFORE I WILL INCLUDE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF BOTH THE NORTHERN AND THESOUTHERN SCHOOLS OF GUNG FU. OBSERVE CLOSELY THE DIFFERENCES AS WELL AS THESIMILARITIES OF UTILIZATION.SOURCE: AN ARTICLE WRITTEN BY BRUCE LEE THAT WAS NEVER PUBLISHED, WRITTEN ONDECEMBER 21, 1964, TO ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES USED BY THE DIFFERENTSCHOOLS OF GUNG FU. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.1-ETEACH YOURSELF SELF-DEFENSEWHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE ATTACKED BY A THUG? WOULD YOU STAND YOUR GROUNDAND FIGHT IT OUT? OR, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD RUNLIKE HELL? BUT WHAT IF YOUR LOVED ONES WERE WITH YOU? WHAT THEN? THAT’S THEALL-IMPORTANT QUESTION.YOU HAVE ONLY TO PICK UP A NEWSPAPER TO READ OF ATTACKS MADE, NOT ONLY ON LONELYCOMMONS, BUT ALSO IN BUILT-UP AREAS, TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR SELF-DEFENSE.“TO BE FOREWARNED IS TO BE FOREARMED” IS AN OLD, RELIABLE PROVERB, AND THEPURPOSE OF MY NOTES ON SELF-DEFENSE IS NOT ONLY TO FOREWARN YOU, BUT TO FOREARMYOU WITH PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MEETING ANY FOE, REGARDLESS OF HIS SIZE ANDSTRENGTH.SOME TIPS ON SELF-DEFENSESELF-DEFENSE IS NOT FUN. YOU ARE LIABLE TO FIND YOURSELF FIGHTING HARD TO AVOIDSERIOUS INJURY AND SO YOU MUST EXPECT TO BE HURT. THE METHOD OF SELF-DEFENSE IAM GOING TO DESCRIBE WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING HURT, BUT IT WILL GIVE YOU AVERY GOOD CHANCE OF EMERGING THE VICTOR WITHOUT SUSTAINING ANY SEVERE INJURY.YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT THIS, AND SHOULD A BLOW FROM YOUR OPPONENT BREAKTHROUGH, IT IS ESSENTIAL—AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING—TO IGNORE THE PAIN AND,INSTEAD OF GIVING UP, USE [IT] AS A SPUR TO COUNTERATTACK AND VICTORY. (BEARTHIS IN MIND: WHEN BEING ATTACKED BY A THUG THE FACT IS THAT HE HAS BUT AONE-TRACK MIND, WHICH IS BENT ON YOUR DESTRUCTION, RARELY CONSIDERING WHAT YOUCAN DO. IF YOUR ACTS SHOW HIM THAT HE IS UP AGAINST SOMETHING HE DID NOT EXPECT,IT WILL CUT DOWN HIS ATTACKING EGO OVER 50 PERCENT AND WILL NEUTRALIZE HISATTACK, IN WHICH CASE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE ON YOUR SIDE.)THIS MAY NOT SOUND VERY ENCOURAGING, BUT THE CHANCES OF ATTACK CAN BE VERYGREATLY REDUCED WHEN YOU ARE WALKING, ESPECIALLY ALONE AT NIGHT OR IN LONELYPLACES, IF YOU ARE ALWAYS ALERT. KEEP AN EYE ON ANY PERSON WHO APPEARS TO BEFOLLOWING YOU OR WHO APPROACHES. KEEP TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE PATH OR IN THEMIDDLE OF A LANE. LISTEN FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS AND WATCH SHADOWS; THAT IS TOSAY, AS YOU PASS A STREET LAMP YOU WILL SEE THE SHADOW OF ANYONE BEHIND YOUTHROWN UP ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF YOU. THE SAME THING HAPPENS AS THE RESULT OFLIGHTS IN HOUSES AND THE HEADLIGHTS OF PASSING CARS. AS SOON AS YOU SEE A SHADOWIN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IMMEDIATELY GLANCE AROUND AND SEE WHO IT IS. ALWAYS, OFCOURSE, AVOID PATCHES OF DEEP SHADOW.THE MAIN THING IS TO SEE THE ATTACK COMING, WHICH ENABLES YOU TO SHOUT, SCREAM,OR JUST CONCENTRATE ON DEALING WITH THE ATTACKER. MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS POSSIBLEAS THIS NATURALLY TENDS TO FRIGHTEN OFF LAWBREAKERS.IN MADE-UP BUT QUIET STREETS, I REPEAT, WALK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PAVEMENT.THIS OBVIATES THE CHANCE OF ANYONE JUMPING OUT OF A HOUSE OR GARDEN ENTRANCE ATYOU TO SNATCH YOUR PURSE, HANDBAG, OR BRIEFCASE OR WORSE. FOR EXACTLY THE SAMEREASON I SUGGEST WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A LANE WHERE THERE ARE NO MADE-UPPATHS AND PERHAPS NO STREET LAMPS. IF YOU CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE, YOU MAY EVENCROSS THE ROAD TO AVOID A PERSON OF WHOM YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS. IF HE FOLLOWS, HEAT LEAST MAKES HIS INTENTION FAIRLY OBVIOUS. ALTHOUGH I AM AGAIN REPEATINGMYSELF, I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUCCESS OF AN [ASSAILANT’S] ATTACK DEPENDS ONSURPRISE, AND IF YOU’RE SUFFICIENTLY ALERT TO PREVENT A SURPRISE, YOURCOUNTERATTACK IS ALREADY HALFWAY TO BEING SUCCESSFUL. THE MAIN THING IS TO SEETHE ATTACK COMING, WHICH ENABLES YOU TO SHOUT, SCREAM, OR JUST CONCENTRATE ONDEALING WITH THE ATTACKER. MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS POSSIBLE AS THIS NATURALLYTENDS TO FRIGHTEN OFF LAWBREAKERS.I HOPE I HAVE NOT FRIGHTENED YOU AND MADE YOU THINK IT IS NOT SAFE TO WALK ALONGTHE STREETS. THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION, BUT NEWSPAPER REPORTS LEAD ONETO BELIEVE THAT ATTACKS ON INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE INCREASING.THE BASIS OF SELF-DEFENSETHERE IS ONLY ONE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DEFENSE: YOU MUST APPLY THE MOSTEFFECTIVE WEAPON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POINT OF YOUR ENEMY.ALTHOUGH I SAY THERE IS ONLY ONE BASIC PRINCIPLE, IT IS BETTER TO BREAK IT INTOSECTIONS AND LOOK AT IT MORE THOROUGHLY:> 1. WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON> 2. SPEED> 3. THE POINT TO ATTACK OR COUNTERATTACKTHE WEAPONGIVEN A CHOICE I WOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE THE LEG. IT IS LONGER THAN THE ARM AND CANDEAL A HEAVIER BLOW, AND IT IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL. SO, SHOULD ANYONE APPROACHYOU, YOUR KICK WOULD MAKE CONTACT BEFORE HIS PUNCH, IF BOTH COMMENCE AT THE SAMESPEED.SPEEDTHERE IS NO TIME TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OF DEFENSE OR WEAPON TO USE. OBVIOUSLY, IFYOUR KICK DOES NOT COMMENCE, HIS PUNCH WILL LAND FIRST, AND YOUR DEFENSE ISUSELESS. ONLY TRAINING CAN PRODUCE RESULTS (I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS). IF YOU DONOT CONSIDER A FEW MINUTES’ TRAINING WORTHWHILE, AND YOU THINK THE CHANCE OFASSAULT IS SMALL, YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ENCOURAGE THUGS TO ATTACK, ANDNO ONE CAN HELP YOU SHOULD AN EMERGENCY ARISE.THERE IS ONLY ONE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DEFENSE: YOU MUST APPLY THE MOSTEFFECTIVE WEAPON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POINT OF YOUR ENEMY.THE POINT OF COUNTERATTACKAMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POINTS FOR YOUR COUNTER IF YOU ARE ATTACKED BY A MANARE THE GROIN, EYES, ABDOMEN, AND KNEE.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ENTITLED “TEACH YOURSELF SELF-DEFENSE,”DATED 1962.

THE SMALLERMAN USUALLY MAKES UP FOR THE IMBALANCE OF POWER BY HIS GREATER AGILITY,FLEXIBILITY, SPEED OF FOOT, AND NERVOUS ACTION.BEAR THIS IN MIND ONCE YOU GO INTO ACTION AND GRAPPLE WITH AN OPPONENT: STRIVETO KEEP HIM OFF BALANCE, REGARDLESS OF HIS SIZE. SO KEEP MOVING FASTER THAN HEAND PAY ABSOLUTELY NO ATTENTION TO HIS SIZE, FIERCE FACIAL CONTORTIONS, OR HISVICIOUS LANGUAGE. YOUR OBJECT IS ALWAYS TO ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT AT HIS WEAKESTPOINTS, WHICH ARE MAINLY GRAVITATIONAL, THROWING HIM OFF BALANCE, AND APPLYINGLEVERAGE PRINCIPLES SO THAT HIS BODY, AND THE LIMBS OF HIS BODY, ARE USED TOWORK TOWARD HIS OWN DEFEAT. “THE BIGGER THEY ARE, THE HARDER THEY FALL.”IN COMBATING A MAN WITH YOUR BARE HANDS, YOU MUST LEARN TO USE YOUR HEAD, KNEES,AND FEET AS WELL AS YOUR HANDS.

USE YOUR COMMON SENSE, AND IF HE CONVINCES YOU, THEN BY ALLMEANS GO AHEAD.HOW DOES ONE JUDGE IF AN INSTRUCTOR IS GOOD? RATHER, THIS QUESTION SHOULD BEREPHRASED TO READ HOW CAN ONE JUDGE IF A METHOD OR SYSTEM IS GOOD? AFTER ALL,ONE CANNOT LEARN THE SPEED OR POWER OF AN INSTRUCTOR, BUT ONE CAN ASSESS HISSKILL. THUS THE SOUNDNESS OF THE SYSTEM, AND NOT THE INSTRUCTOR, IS TO BECONSIDERED; THE INSTRUCTOR IS MERELY THERE TO POINT THE WAY AND LEAD HISDISCIPLES TO AN AWARENESS THAT HE HIMSELF IS THE ONE AND ONLY ONE TO GIVE TRUEFEELING AND EXPRESSION TO THE SYSTEM.THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE MECHANICAL AND COMPLICATED, BUT SIMPLY SIMPLE, WITH NO“MAGICAL POWER.” THE METHOD (WHICH IS ULTIMATELY NO METHOD) IS THERE TO REMINDONE WHEN HE HAS DONE ENOUGH. THE TECHNIQUES HAVE NO MAGICAL POWER AND ARENOTHING SPECIAL; THEY ARE MERELY THE SIMPLICITY OF PROFOUND COMMON SENSE.DO NOT, HOWEVER, BE IMPRESSED BY INSTRUCTORS WHO HAVE BRICK-BREAKING HANDS,INVINCIBLE STOMACHS, IRON FOREARMS, OR EVEN SPEED, FOR THAT MATTER. REMEMBER,YOU CANNOT LEARN HIS ABILITY, BUT YOU CAN LEARN HIS SKILL. AT ANY RATE, THEABILITY TO BREAK STONES, TO TAKE A PUNCH ON THE BODY, TO JUMP SO MANY FEET OFFTHE GROUND ARE BUT STUNTS IN THE CHINESE ART OF GUNG FU. OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCEARE THE TECHNIQUES.BREAKING A BRICK AND PUNCHING A HUMAN BEING ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS: A BRICKDOES NOT GIVE, WHEREAS WHEN BEING HIT, A HUMAN BEING SPINS, FALLS, AND SO FORTH,THUS DISSOLVING THE POWER OF THE BLOW. WHAT IS THE USE IF ONE HAS NO TECHNIQUETO BRING HOME HIS SO-CALLED “KILLING STROKE”? ON TOP OF THAT, BRICKS AND STONESDO NOT MOVE AND FIGHT BACK. THUS, THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE THING CONSIDERED,AND, AS MENTIONED BEFORE, A SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE MECHANICAL, INTRICATE, ANDFANCIFUL, BUT SIMPLY SIMPLE.WHAT IF THE “MASTER” DOES NOT WISH TO SHOW YOU HIS STYLE? WHAT IF HE IS “TOOHUMBLE” AND FIRMLY GUARDS HIS “DEADLY” SECRET? ONE THING I HOPE READERS SHOULDREALIZE REGARDING ORIENTAL HUMILITY AND SECRECY IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THATHIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS DO NOT BOAST AND SOMETIMES DO NOT TEACH GUNG FU TOJUST ANYBODY, THE FACT REMAINS THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN BEINGS, AND CERTAINLYTHEY HAVE NOT SPENT TEN, TWENTY, OR THIRTY YEARS ON AN ART IN ORDER TO SAYNOTHING ABOUT IT. EVEN LAO-TZU, THE AUTHOR OF THE TAO TEH CHING, AND THE MAN WHOWROTE “HE WHO KNOWS DOES NOT SPEAK. HE WHO SPEAKS, DOES NOT KNOW,” WROTEFIVE-THOUSAND WORDS TO EXPLAIN HIS DOCTRINE.IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PASS FOR BEING MORE THAN THEIR ABILITY, THE HONORABLEMASTERS, PROFESSORS, AND EXPERTS (IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY) SAY LITTLE. THEYCERTAINLY HAVE MASTERED THE ORIENTAL HIGHEST WAY OF HUMILITY AND SECRECY, FOR ITIS DEFINITELY EASIER TO LOOK WISE THAN TO TALK WISELY (TO ACT WISELY IS, OFCOURSE, EVEN MORE DIFFICULT). THE MORE ONE WANTS TO PASS AT A VALUE ABOVE HISWORTH, THE MORE HE WILL KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. FOR ONCE HE TALKS (OR MOVES),PEOPLE CAN CERTAINLY CLASSIFY HIM ACCORDINGLY.THE UNKNOWN IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL AND THE “FIFTEENTH-DEGREE RED BELT HOLDERS,” THE“EXPERTS FROM SUPERADVANCED SCHOOLS,” AND THE “HONORABLE MASTERS” KNOW HOW TOGATHER AROUND THEM A MYSTERIOUS VEIL OF SECRECY.

SOME INSTRUCTORS, ONTHE OTHER HAND, CLAIM THAT WITH THEIR SUPERPOWERFUL SYSTEM, ONE CAN SMASHTHROUGH ANY DEFENSE. ONCE AGAIN WE MUST REALIZE THAT A PERSON DOES MOVE ANDCHANGE JUST AS A REED OF BAMBOO MOVES BACK AND FORTH IN A STORM TO “DISSOLVE”THE STRONG WIND.SO NEITHER GENTLENESS NOR FIRMNESS HOLDS ANY MORE THAN HALF OF A BROKEN WHOLE,WHICH, FITTED TOGETHER, FORMS THE TRUE WAY OF GUNG FU.

STILL SOME FAVOR DEFORMED HANDS AND LEGS AND DEVOTETHEIR TIME TO FIGHTING BRICKS, STONES, BOARDS, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON.TO ME THE EXTRAORDINARY ASPECT OF GUNG FU LIES IN ITS SIMPLICITY. GUNG FU ISSIMPLY THE “DIRECT EXPRESSION” OF ONE’S FEELING WITH THE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTSAND ENERGY. EVERY MOVEMENT IS BEING SO OF ITSELF WITHOUT THE ARTIFICIALITIESWITH WHICH PEOPLE TEND TO COMPLICATE IT. THE EASY WAY IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT WAY,AND GUNG FU IS NOTHING AT ALL SPECIAL; THE CLOSER TO THE TRUE WAY OF GUNG FU,THE LESS WASTAGE OF EXPRESSION THERE IS.INSTEAD OF FACING COMBAT IN ITS SUCHNESS, QUITE A FEW SYSTEMS OF MARTIAL ARTACCUMULATE A “FANCY MESS” THAT DISTORTS AND CRAMPS THEIR PRACTITIONERS ANDDISTRACTS THEM FROM THE ACTUAL REALITY OF COMBAT, WHICH IS “SIMPLE” AND “DIRECT”AND “NONCLASSICAL.” INSTEAD OF GOING IMMEDIATELY TO THE HEART OF THINGS, FLOWERYFORMS AND ARTIFICIAL TECHNIQUES (ORGANIZED DESPAIR!) ARE “RITUALLY PRACTICED” TOSIMULATE ACTUAL COMBAT. THUS INSTEAD OF “BEING” IN COMBAT, THESE PRACTITIONERSARE IDEALISTICALLY “DOING” SOMETHING ABOUT COMBAT. WORSE STILL, SUPERMENTAL THISAND SPIRITUAL THAT ARE IGNORANTLY INCORPORATED UNTIL THESE PRACTITIONERS AREDRIFTING FURTHER AND FURTHER INTO THE DISTANCE OF ABSTRACTION AND MYSTERY, UNTILWHAT THEY DO RESEMBLES ANYTHING FROM ACROBATICS TO MODERN DANCING, BUT NOT THEACTUAL REALITY OF COMBAT.ALL THESE COMPLEX MESSES ARE ACTUALLY FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO “ARREST” AND “FIX” THEEVER-CHANGING MOVEMENTS IN COMBAT AND TO DISSECT AND ANALYZE THEM LIKE A CORPSE.REAL COMBAT IS NOT FIXED AND IS VERY MUCH “ALIVE.” SUCH MEANS OF PRACTICE (AFORM OF PARALYSIS) WILL ONLY “SOLIDIFY” AND “CONDITION” WHAT WAS ONCE FLUID ANDALIVE. WHEN YOU GET OFF SOPHISTICATION AND WHATNOT AND LOOK AT IT“REALISTICALLY,” THESE ROBOTS (PRACTITIONERS, THAT IS) ARE BLINDLY DEVOTINGTHEMSELVES TO THE SYSTEMATIC USELESSNESS OF PRACTICING “ROUTINES” OR “STUNTS”THAT LEAD NOWHERE.GUNG FU IS TO BE LOOKED THROUGH WITHOUT FANCY SUITS AND MATCHING TIES, AND ITWILL REMAIN A SECRET WHEN WE ANXIOUSLY LOOK FOR SOPHISTICATION AND DEADLYTECHNIQUES. IF THERE ARE REALLY ANY SECRETS AT ALL, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN MISSEDBY THE SEEKING AND STRIVING OF ITS PRACTITIONERS (AFTER ALL, HOW MANY WAYS ARETHERE TO COME IN ON AN OPPONENT WITHOUT “DEVIATING TOO MUCH FROM THE NATURALCOURSE”?). TRUE, GUNG FU VALUES THE WONDER OF THE ORDINARY, AND THE CULTIVATIONOF GUNG FU IS NOT DAILY INCREASE BUT DAILY DECREASE. BEING WISE IN GUNG FU DOESNOT MEAN ADDING MORE, BUT TO BE ABLE TO DO AWAY WITH ORNAMENTATION AND BE SIMPLYSIMPLE—LIKE A SCULPTOR BUILDING A STATUE NOT BY ADDING, BUT BY HACKING AWAY THEUNESSENTIAL SO THAT THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED UNOBSTRUCTED. IN SHORT, GUNG FUIS SATISFIED WITH ONE’S BARE HANDS WITHOUT THE FANCY DECORATION OF COLORFULGLOVES, WHICH TEND TO HINDER THE NATURAL FUNCTION OF THE HAND.ART IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SELF. THE MORE COMPLICATED AND RESTRICTIVE A METHODIS, THE LESS THE OPPORTUNITY THERE WILL BE FOR THE EXPRESSION OF ONE’S ORIGINALSENSE OF FREEDOM! THE TECHNIQUES, THOUGH THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THEEARLY STAGE, SHOULD NOT BE TOO RESTRICTIVE, COMPLEX, OR MECHANICAL. IF WE CLINGTO THEM WE WILL BECOME BOUND BY THEIR LIMITATIONS. REMEMBER, YOU ARE“EXPRESSING” THE TECHNIQUE AND NOT “DOING” THE TECHNIQUE. WHEN SOMEONE ATTACKSYOU IT IS NOT TECHNIQUE NUMBER ONE (OR IS IT TECHNIQUE NUMBER TWO, STANCE TWO,SECTION FOUR?) THAT YOU ARE DOING, BUT THE MOMENT YOU ARE “AWARE” OF HIS ATTACKYOU SIMPLY MOVE IN LIKE SOUND AND ECHO WITHOUT DELIBERATION. IT IS AS THOUGHWHEN I CALL YOU, YOU ANSWER ME, OR WHEN I THROW SOMETHING TO YOU, YOU CATCH IT.THAT’S ALL.SOURCE: A TYPED ESSAY OF BRUCE LEE’S ENTITLED “MY VIEW ON GUNG FU” THAT BRUCELEE HANDED OUT TO MEMBERS OF THE OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES CHAPTERS OF HIS JUN FANGUNG FU INSTITUTES, CIRCA 1967."},{"pageContent":"PART 2PHILOSOPHYImage [../Images/c2.jpg][../Images/32a.jpg]IT MAY SURPRISE THOSE WHO THINK OF BRUCE LEE PRIMARILY AS A MARTIAL ARTIST THATHIS TRUE PASSION WAS PHILOSOPHY.

AFTERTHE COMPLETION OF THE BIG BOSS, MANY PEOPLE STARTED ASKING ME THIS: WHAT WAS ITTHAT MADE ME GIVE UP MY CAREER IN THE STATES AND RETURN TO HONG KONG TO SHOOTCHINESE FILMS?PERHAPS THE GENERAL FEELING WAS THAT IT WAS ALL HELL TO HAVE TO WORK ON CHINESEFILMS SINCE THE CHINESE FILM INDUSTRY WAS STILL SO UNDERDEVELOPED. TO THE ABOVEQUESTION I FIND NO EASY EXPLANATION EXCEPT THAT I AM CHINESE AND I HAVE TOFULFILL MY DUTY AS A CHINESE. THE TRUTH IS, I AM AN AMERICAN-BORN CHINESE. THATI SHOULD BECOME AN AMERICAN-BORN CHINESE WAS ACCIDENTAL, OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEENMY FATHER’S ARRANGEMENT. AT THAT TIME, THE CHINESE INHABITANTS IN THE STATES,MOSTLY FROM THE PROVINCE OF KWANGTUNG, WERE VERY MUCH HOMESICK: NOSTALGIA WASHELD TOWARDS EVERYTHING THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR HOMELAND.IN THIS CONTEXT, CHINESE OPERA, WITH ITS UNMISTAKABLY UNIQUE CHINESECHARACTERISTICS, WON THE DAY.

I STARTED OFF AS A BIT PLAYER AND GRADUALLY BECAME THESTAR OF THE SHOW.THAT WAS A VERY CRUCIAL EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE. FOR THE FIRST TIME I WASCONFRONTED WITH GENUINE CHINESE CULTURE. THE SENSE OF BEING PART OF IT WAS SOSTRONGLY FELT THAT I WAS ENCHANTED. I DIDN’T REALIZE IT THEN, NOR DID I SEE HOWGREAT AN INFLUENCE ENVIRONMENT CAN HAVE ON THE MOLDING OF ONE’S CHARACTER ANDPERSONALITY. NEVERTHELESS, THE NOTION OF “BEING CHINESE” WAS THEN DULYCONCEIVED.I THOUGHT THAT VICTORY MEANT BEATING DOWN OTHERS, BUT I FAILED TO REALIZE THATVICTORY GAINED BY WAY OF FORCE WAS NOT REAL VICTORY. WHEN I ENROLLED IN THEUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND WAS ENLIGHTENED BY PHILOSOPHY, I REGRETTED ALL MYPREVIOUS IMMATURE ASSUMPTIONS.FROM BOYHOOD TO ADOLESCENCE, I PRESENTED MYSELF AS A TROUBLEMAKER AND WASGREATLY DISAPPROVED OF BY MY ELDERS. I WAS EXTREMELY MISCHIEVOUS, AGGRESSIVE,HOT-TEMPERED, AND FIERCE. NOT ONLY MY “OPPONENTS” OF MORE OR LESS MY AGE STAYEDOUT OF MY WAY, BUT EVEN THE ADULTS SOMETIMES GAVE IN TO MY TEMPER. I NEVER KNEWWHAT IT WAS THAT MADE ME SO PUGNACIOUS. THE FIRST THOUGHT THAT CAME INTO MY MINDWHENEVER I MET SOMEBODY I DISLIKED WAS, “CHALLENGE HIM!” CHALLENGE HIM WITHWHAT? THE ONLY CONCRETE THING THAT I COULD THINK OF WAS MY FISTS. I THOUGHT THATVICTORY MEANT BEATING DOWN OTHERS, BUT I FAILED TO REALIZE THAT VICTORY GAINEDBY WAY OF FORCE WAS NOT REAL VICTORY. WHEN I ENROLLED IN THE UNIVERSITY OFWASHINGTON AND WAS ENLIGHTENED BY PHILOSOPHY, I REGRETTED ALL MY PREVIOUSIMMATURE ASSUMPTIONS.MY MAJORING IN PHILOSOPHY WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE PUGNACITY OF MY CHILDHOOD.I OFTEN ASK MYSELF THESE QUESTIONS:> • WHAT COMES AFTER VICTORY?> • WHY DO PEOPLE VALUE VICTORY SO MUCH?> • WHAT IS “GLORY”?> • WHAT KIND OF “VICTORY” IS “GLORIOUS”?WHEN MY TUTOR ASSISTED ME IN CHOOSING MY COURSES, HE ADVISED ME TO TAKE UPPHILOSOPHY BECAUSE OF MY INQUISITIVENESS. HE SAID, “PHILOSOPHY WILL TELL YOUWHAT MAN LIVES FOR.” WHEN I TOLD MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES THAT I HAD PICKED UPPHILOSOPHY, THEY WERE ALL AMAZED. EVERYBODY THOUGHT I HAD BETTER GO INTOPHYSICAL EDUCATION SINCE THE ONLY EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY THAT I WASINTERESTED IN, FROM MY CHILDHOOD UNTIL I GRADUATED FROM MY SECONDARY SCHOOL, WASCHINESE MARTIAL ARTS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, MARTIAL ARTS AND PHILOSOPHY SEEM TOBE ANTITHETICAL TO EACH OTHER. BUT I THINK THAT THE THEORETICAL PART OF CHINESEMARTIAL ARTS SEEMS TO BE GETTING INDISTINCT.EVERY ACTION SHOULD HAVE ITS WHY AND WHEREFORE; AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A COMPLETEAND PROFICIENT THEORY TO BACK UP THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS. IWISH TO INFUSE THE SPIRIT OF PHILOSOPHY INTO MARTIAL ARTS; THEREFORE I INSISTEDON STUDYING PHILOSOPHY.I HAVE NEVER DISCONTINUED STUDYING AND PRACTICING MARTIAL ARTS. WHILE I AMTRACING THE SOURCE AND HISTORY OF CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS, THIS DOUBT ALWAYS COMESUP: NOW THAT EVERY BRANCH OF CHINESE GUNG FU HAS ITS OWN FORM, ITS OWNESTABLISHED STYLE, ARE THESE THE ORIGINAL INTENTIONS OF THEIR FOUNDERS? I DON’TTHINK SO. FORMALITY COULD BE A HINDRANCE TO PROGRESS; THIS IS APPLICABLE TOEVERYTHING, INCLUDING PHILOSOPHY. PHILOSOPHY BRINGS MY JEET KUNE DO INTO A NEWREALM IN THE SPHERE OF MARTIAL ARTS, AND JEET KUNE DO BRINGS MY ACTING CAREER TOA NEW HORIZON.SOURCE: A TAIWAN NEWSPAPER ARTICLE WRITTEN BY BRUCE LEE, ENTITLED “ME AND JEETKUNE DO,” DATED 1972, REPRINTED IN THE MAGAZINE BRUCE LEE: STUDIES ON JEET KUNEDO, (C) 1976, BRUCE LEE JEET KUNE DO CLUB, HONG KONG, AND REPRINTED IN ITSENTIRETY IN VOLUME 1 OF THE BRUCE LEE LIBRARY SERIES:WORDS OF THE DRAGON.2-BREGARDING HUMAN UNDERSTANDINGWITH REGARD TO HUMAN UNDERSTANDING THERE ARE SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS AND SIMPLEIDEAS. A SIMPLE IMPRESSION HAS A STRONGER AND MORE VIVID PICTURE THAN A SIMPLEIDEA AND IS ALSO THE CAUSE OF A SIMPLE IDEA.IN OTHER WORDS, SIMPLE IDEAS ARE COPIES OF THE SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,I SEE SOMETHING EXCITING, AND THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING MOVES ME, AND BECAUSE OFTHIS IMPRESSION I CAN LATER ON HAVE AN IDEA OF IT. THEREFORE SIMPLE IDEAS AREDIRECT COPIES OF SIMPLE IMPRESSIONS AND CANNOT BE BROKEN INTO PARTS BUT ARE AUNIFIED WHOLE.ALTHOUGH COMPLEX IMPRESSIONS AND COMPLEX IDEAS ARE IN GENERAL A COPY OF THEOTHER (COMPLEX IDEAS ARE COPIES OF COMPLEX IMPRESSIONS), IN SOME UNUSUAL CASESTHEY ARE NOT SO. FOR INSTANCE, I CAN IMAGINE A PLACE WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN, ORIN THE CASE OF A MAN WHO IS COLOR BLIND OF THE COLOR BLUE, HE MAY MAKE UP HISOWN IDEA OF THAT COLOR BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE OTHER COLORS.THE TERM “COMPLEX IDEA,” BY THE WAY, SIGNIFIES SOMETHING THAT IS CONSTITUTED OFSIMPLE IDEAS. FOR INSTANCE, AN APPLE THAT HAS COLOR, TASTE, SIZE, AND SO FORTH.[../Images/36a.jpg]SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN PHILOSOPHY PAPER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OFWASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 18, 1964. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.2-CLIVING: THE ONENESS OF THINGSMANY PHILOSOPHERS ARE AMONG THOSE WHO SAY ONE THING AND DO ANOTHER, AND THEPHILOSOPHY THAT A MAN PROFESSES IS OFTEN QUITE OTHER THAN THE ONE HE LIVES BY.PHILOSOPHY IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING MORE AND MORE ONLY SOMETHING PROFESSED.PHILOSOPHY IS NOT “LIVING” BUT AN ACTIVITY CONCERNING THEORETIC KNOWLEDGE, ANDMOST PHILOSOPHERS ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE THINGS, BUT SIMPLY TO THEORIZE ABOUTTHEM, TO CONTEMPLATE THEM. AND TO CONTEMPLATE A THING IMPLIES MAINTAININGONESELF OUTSIDE IT, RESOLVED TO KEEP A DISTANCE BETWEEN IT AND OURSELVES.[../Images/37a.jpg]IN LIFE, WE ACCEPT NATURALLY THE FULL REALITY OF WHAT WE SEE AND FEEL IN GENERALWITH NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT. PHILOSOPHY, HOWEVER, DOES NOT ACCEPT WHAT LIFEBELIEVES; IT STRIVES TO CONVERT REALITY INTO A PROBLEM. LIKE ASKING SUCHQUESTIONS AS “IS THIS CHAIR THAT I SEE IN FRONT OF ME REALLY THERE?” “CAN ITEXIST BY ITSELF?” THUS, RATHER THAN MAKING LIFE EASY FOR LIVING BY LIVING INACCORD WITH LIFE, PHILOSOPHY COMPLICATES IT BY REPLACING THE WORLD’STRANQUILLITY WITH THE RESTLESSNESS OF PROBLEMS. IT IS LIKE ASKING A NORMALPERSON HOW HE ACTUALLY BREATHES! THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY CHOKE THE BREATH OUT OFHIM WHEN HE CONSCIOUSLY DESCRIBES THE PROCESS. WHY TRY TO ARREST AND INTERRUPTTHE FLOW OF LIFE? WHY CREATE SUCH FUSS? A PERSON SIMPLY BREATHES.THE WESTERN APPROACH TO REALITY IS MOSTLY THROUGH THEORY, AND THEORY BEGINS BYDENYING REALITY—TO TALK ABOUT REALITY, TO GO AROUND REALITY, TO CATCH ANYTHINGTHAT ATTRACTS OUR SENSES—INTELLECT AND ABSTRACT IT AWAY FORM REALITY ITSELF.THUS PHILOSOPHY BEGINS BY SAYING THAT THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS NOT A BASIC FACT,THAT ITS EXISTENCE CAN BE DOUBTED, AND THAT EVERY PROPOSITION IN WHICH THEREALITY OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS AFFIRMED IS NOT AN EVIDENT PROPOSITION BUT ONETHAT NEEDS TO BE DIVIDED, DISSECTED, AND ANALYZED. IT IS TO STAND CONSCIOUSLYASIDE AND TRY TO SQUARE A CIRCLE.RENE DESCARTES (1596–1650), THE GREAT FRENCH PHILOSOPHER AND MATHEMATICIAN,RAISED THE ABOVE PROBLEM. SINCE EXISTENCE OF ANYTHING, INCLUDING MY BEING, ISNOT CERTAIN, WHAT IS THERE IN THE UNIVERSE BEYOND ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT? WHENONE HAS DOUBTS ABOUT THE WORLD, AND EVEN ABOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WHAT ISLEFT? LET’S “STAND” OUTSIDE THIS WORLD FOR A MOMENT AND FOLLOW DESCARTES AND SEEWHAT IS ACTUALLY LEFT.ACCORDING TO DESCARTES, THE DOUBT ITSELF IS LEFT, BECAUSE FOR SOMETHING TO BEDOUBTFUL, IT MUST SEEM TO ME THAT IT IS; AND THE WHOLE UNIVERSE MAY SEEM TO MEDOUBTFUL, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT OF ITS SEEMING TO ME. TO DOUBT IS TO THINK, ANDTHOUGHT IS THE ONLY THING IN THE UNIVERSE WHOSE EXISTENCE CANNOT BE DENIED,BECAUSE TO DENY IS TO THINK. WHEN ONE SAYS THAT THOUGHT EXISTS, IT AUTOMATICALLYINCLUDES SAYING THAT ONE EXISTS BECAUSE THERE IS NO THOUGHT THAT DOES NOTCONTAIN AS ONE OF ITS ELEMENTS A SUBJECT WHO THINKS.IN CHINESE TAOISM AND CH’AN (ZEN) THE WORLD IS SEEN AS AN INSEPARABLE,INTERRELATED FIELD, NO PART OF WHICH CAN ACTUALLY BE SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER.THAT IS, THERE WOULD BE NO BRIGHT STARS WITHOUT DIM STARS, AND, WITHOUT THESURROUNDING DARKNESS, NO STARS AT ALL. OPPOSITIONS HAVE BECOME MUTUALLYDEPENDENT INSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, AND THERE IS NO LONGER ANY CONFLICTBETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MAN AND NATURE.SO IF THOUGHT EXISTS, I WHO THINK AND THE WORLD ABOUT WHICH I THINK ALSO EXIST;THE ONE EXISTS BUT FOR THE OTHER, THERE BEING NO POSSIBLE SEPARATION BETWEENTHEM. THEREFORE, THE WORLD AND I ARE BOTH IN ACTIVE CORRELATION; I AM THAT WHICHSEES THE WORLD, AND THE WORLD IS THAT WHICH IS SEEN BY ME. I EXIST FOR THEWORLD, AND THE WORLD EXISTS FOR ME. IF THERE WERE NO THINGS TO BE SEEN, THOUGHTABOUT, AND IMAGINED, I WOULD NOT SEE, THINK, OR IMAGINE. THAT IS TO SAY, I WOULDNOT EXIST. ONE SURE AND PRIMARY AND FUNDAMENTAL FACT IS THE JOINT EXISTENCE OF ASUBJECT AND ITS WORLD. THE ONE DOES NOT EXIST WITHOUT THE OTHER. I ACQUIRE NOUNDERSTANDING OF MYSELF EXCEPT AS I TAKE ACCOUNT OF OBJECTS, OF THESURROUNDINGS. I DO NOT THINK UNLESS I THINK OF THINGS—AND THEREFORE, FINDMYSELF.IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK MERELY ABOUT OBJECTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, WHETHER THEY ARETHOUGHT SENSATIONS OR WAX CANDLES. AN OBJECT MUST HAVE A SUBJECT, ANDSUBJECT-OBJECT IS A PAIR OF COMPLEMENTARIES (NOT OPPOSITES), LIKE ALL OTHERS,WHICH ARE TWO HALVES OF ONE WHOLE, AND ARE A FUNCTION EACH OF THE OTHER. WHEN WEHOLD TO THE CORE, THE OPPOSITE SIDES ARE THE SAME IF THEY ARE SEEN FROM THECENTER OF THE MOVING CIRCLE. I DO NOT EXPERIENCE; I AM EXPERIENCE. I AM NOT THESUBJECT OF AN EXPERIENCE; I AM THAT EXPERIENCE. I AM AWARENESS. NOTHING ELSE CANBE I OR CAN EXIST.THUS WE DO NOT SWEAT BECAUSE IT IS HOT; THE SWEATING IS THE HEAT. IT IS JUST ASTRUE TO SAY THAT THE SUN IS LIGHT BECAUSE OF THE SUN. THIS PECULIAR CHINESEVIEWPOINT IS UNFAMILIAR BECAUSE IT IS OUR SETTLED CONVENTION TO THINK THAT HEATCOMES FIRST AND THEN, BY CAUSALITY, THE BODY SWEATS. TO PUT IT THE OTHER WAYROUND IS STARTLING, LIKE SAYING “CHEESE AND BREAD” INSTEAD OF “BREAD ANDCHEESE.” THIS SHOCKING AND SEEMINGLY ILLOGICAL REVERSAL OF COMMON SENSE MAYPERHAPS BE CLARIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION OF “THE MOON IN THE WATER.”THE MOON IN THE WATERTHE PHENOMENON OF THE MOON IN THE WATER IS LIKENED TO HUMAN EXPERIENCE. THEWATER IS THE SUBJECT, AND THE MOON THE OBJECT. WHEN THERE IS NO WATER, THERE ISNO MOON IN THE WATER, AND LIKEWISE WHEN THERE IS NO MOON. BUT WHEN THE MOONRISES, THE WATER DOES NOT WAIT TO RECEIVE ITS IMAGE, AND WHEN EVEN THE TINIESTDROP OF WATER IS POURED OUT, THE MOON DOES NOT WAIT TO CAST ITS REFLECTION. FORTHE MOON DOES NOT INTEND TO CAST ITS REFLECTION, AND THE WATER DOES NOT RECEIVETHE MOON’S IMAGE ON PURPOSE. THE EVENT IS CAUSED AS MUCH BY THE WATER AS BY THEMOON, AND AS THE WATER MANIFESTS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MOON, THE MOON MANIFESTSTHE CLARITY OF THE WATER.EVERYTHING DOES HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP, A MUTUALITY IN WHICH THE SUBJECTCREATES THE OBJECT JUST AS MUCH AS THE OBJECT CREATES THE SUBJECT. THUS THEKNOWER NO LONGER FEELS HIMSELF TO BE SEPARATED FROM THE KNOWN; THE EXPERIENCERNO LONGER FEELS HIMSELF TO STAND APART FROM THE EXPERIENCE. CONSEQUENTLY, THEWHOLE NOTION OF GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF LIFE, OF SEEKING FROM EXPERIENCE,BECOMES ABSURD. TO PUT IT IN ANOTHER WAY, IT BECOMES VIVIDLY CLEAR THAT INCONCRETE FACT I HAVE NO OTHER SELF THAN THE ONENESS OF THINGS OF WHICH I AMAWARE.MASTER LIN-CHI OF THE T’ANG DYNASTY SAID, “JUST BE ORDINARY AND NOTHING SPECIAL.EAT YOUR FOOD, MOVE YOUR BOWELS, PASS WATER, AND WHEN YOU ARE TIRED, GO AND LIEDOWN. THE IGNORANT WILL LAUGH AT ME, BUT THE WISE WILL UNDERSTAND.” A PERSON ISNOT LIVING A CONCEPTUALLY OR SCIENTIFICALLY DEFINED LIFE; FOR THE ESSENTIALQUALITY OF LIVING LIFE LIES SIMPLY IN THE LIVING. DO NOT, AS WHEN IN THE MIDSTOF ENJOYING YOURSELF, STEP OUT FOR A MOMENT AND EXAMINE YOURSELF TO SEE IF YOUARE GETTING THE UTMOST OUT OF THE OCCASION. OR NOT CONTENT WITH THE HAPPYFEELING, YOU WANT TO FEEL YOURSELF FEELING HAPPY—SO AS TO BE SURE NOT TO MISSANYTHING.LIVING EXISTS WHEN LIFE LIVES THROUGH US—UNHAMPERED IN ITS FLOW, FOR HE WHO ISLIVING IS NOT CONSCIOUS OF LIVING AND, IN THIS, IS THE LIFE HE LIVES. LIFELIVES; AND IN THE LIVING FLOW, NO QUESTIONS ARE RAISED. THE REASON IS THAT LIFEIS A LIVING NOW! COMPLETENESS, THE NOW, IS AN ABSENCE OF THE CONSCIOUS MINDSTRIVING TO DIVIDE THAT WHICH IS INDIVISIBLE. FOR ONCE THE COMPLETENESS OFTHINGS IS TAKEN APART, IT IS NO LONGER COMPLETE. ALL THE PIECES OF A CAR THATHAS BEEN TAKEN APART MAY BE THERE, BUT IT IS NO LONGER A CAR IN ITS ORIGINALNATURE, WHICH IS ITS FUNCTION OR LIFE. SO IN ORDER TO LIVE LIFE WHOLEHEARTEDLY,THE ANSWER IS, LIFE SIMPLY IS.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ENTITLED “LIVING:THE ‘ONENESS’ OF THINGS,”CIRCA 1963.

IT IS BECAUSE ONE SINGLES OUT FIRMNESS AND LOOKSAT IT AS DISTINCT FROM SOFTNESS THAT THE IDEA OF “OPPOSITE” IS FORMED. ONCE ADISTINCTION IS MADE ABOUT SOMETHING, THAT CERTAIN SOMETHING WILL SUGGEST ITSOPPOSITE.[../Images/41a.jpg]ON THE SURFACE, SOFTNESS AND FIRMNESS APPEAR TO BE OPPOSITES, BUT IN REALITYTHEY ARE INTER-DEPENDENT—THE COMPLEMENTARY PARTS OF A WHOLE.ON THE SURFACE, SOFTNESS AND FIRMNESS APPEAR TO BE OPPOSITES, BUT IN REALITYTHEY ARE INTER-DEPENDENT—THE COMPLEMENTARY PARTS OF A WHOLE. THEIR MEANING(SOFTNESS/FIRMNESS) IS OBTAINED FROM EACH OTHER, AND THEY FIND THEIR COMPLETIONTHROUGH EACH OTHER. THIS “ONENESS” OF THINGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHINESEMIND. IN THE CHINESE LANGUAGE, EVENTS ARE LOOKED ON AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THEIRMEANINGS ARE DERIVED FROM EACH OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR“GOOD” AND THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR “NOT GOOD,” WHEN COMBINED TOGETHER WILLREFLECT THE “QUALITY” OF SOMETHING (WHETHER GOOD OR NOT GOOD). LIKEWISE, THECHINESE CHARACTER FOR “LONG” AND THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR “SHORT,” WHEN BROUGHTTOGETHER MEAN “LENGTH”; OR THE CHARACTER FOR “BUYING” WHEN COMBINED WITH THECHARACTER FOR “SELLING” FORMS THE NEW WORD “TRADE.”NOT ONLY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY PART, BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT “ONE”SPECIAL THING IT, TOO, SHOULD HAVE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OTHER COMPONENTPART. IN OTHER WORDS, SOFTNESS IS TO BE CONCEALED IN FIRMNESS AND FIRMNESS INSOFTNESS.ALL THESE EXAMPLES SHOW US THAT EVERYTHING HAS A COMPLEMENTARY PART TO FORM AWHOLE. NOW WE CAN LOOK AT THE “ONENESS” OF FIRMNESS AND SOFTNESS, WITHOUTFAVORING EITHER SIDE TOO MUCH SO THAT WE CAN TRULY APPRECIATE THE “GOOD/BAD” OFTHEM. NOT ONLY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY PART, BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT“ONE” SPECIAL THING IT, TOO, SHOULD HAVE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE OTHERCOMPONENT PART. IN OTHER WORDS, SOFTNESS IS TO BE CONCEALED IN FIRMNESS ANDFIRMNESS IN SOFTNESS. IN EITHER CASE, BE IT SOFTNESS OR FIRMNESS, IT SHOULDNEVER STAND ALONE; FOR STANDING ALONE WILL LEAD TO EXTREMES AND GOING TOEXTREMES IS NEVER BEST.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN PAPER ENTITLED “THE UNION OF FIRMNESS ANDSOFTNESS.” BRUCE LEE PAPERS.2-ETAOISMTAOISM IS A PHILOSOPHY OF THE ESSENTIAL UNITY OF THE UNIVERSE (MONISM), ORREVERSION, POLARIZATION (YIN AND YANG), AND ETERNAL CYCLES, OF THE LEVELING OFALL DIFFERENCES, THE RELATIVITY OF ALL STANDARDS, AND THE RETURN OF ALL TO THEPRIMEVAL ONE, THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE, THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS.[../Images/43a.jpg]FROM THIS PHILOSOPHY NATURALLY ARISES THE ABSENCE OF DESIRE FOR STRIFE ANDCONTENTION AND FIGHTING FOR ADVANTAGE. THUS THE TEACHINGS OF HUMILITY ANDMEEKNESS OF THE CHRISTIAN SERMON ON THE MOUNT FIND A RATIONAL BASIS, AND APEACEABLE TEMPER IS BRED IN MAN. TAOISM EMPHASIZES NONRESISTANCE AND THEIMPORTANCE OF GENTLENESS.THE BASIC IDEA OF THE TAO TE CHING IS NATURALISM IN THE SENSE OF WU WEI(INACTION), WHICH REALLY MEANS TAKING NO UNNATURAL ACTION. IT MEANS SPONTANEITY;THAT IS, “TO SUPPORT ALL THINGS IN THEIR NATURAL STAGE” AND THUS ALLOW THEM TO“TRANSFORM SPONTANEOUSLY.” IN THIS MANNER TAO “UNDERTAKES NO ACTIVITY AND YETTHERE IS NOTHING LEFT UNDONE.” IN ORDINARY LIFE IT IS EXPRESSED IN “PRODUCINGAND REARING THINGS WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF THEM” AND “DOING WORK BUT NOTTAKING PRIDE IN IT”—THUS THE NATURAL WAY STANDS IN COMPLEMENT TO ALL ARTIFICIALWAYS SUCH AS REGULATION, CEREMONIES, AND SO FORTH. THIS IS THE REASON THAT THETAOISTS DON’T LIKE FORMALITIES AND ARTIFICIALITIES.THE BASIC IDEA OF THE TAO TE CHING IS NATURALISM IN THE SENSE OF WU WEI(INACTION), WHICH REALLY MEANS TAKING NO UNNATURAL ACTION. IT MEANS SPONTANEITY;THAT IS, “TO SUPPORT ALL THINGS IN THEIR NATURAL STAGE” AND THUS ALLOW THEM TO“TRANSFORM SPONTANEOUSLY.”THE NATURAL WAY IS COMPARED WITH THE WAYS OF WATER. THE FEMALE AND THE INFANT,THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WEAK. WHILE THERE SEEMS TO BE GLORIFICATION OF THE WEAK,THE STRONGEST STRESS REALLY LIES WITH “SIMPLICITY.” A SIMPLE LIFE IS ONE OFPLAINNESS IN WHICH PROFIT IS DISCARDED, CLEVERNESS ABANDONED, SELFISHNESSELIMINATED, AND DESIRES REDUCED. IT IS THE LIFE OF “PERFECTION WHICH SEEMS TO BEINCOMPLETE AND OF FULLNESS WHICH SEEMS TO BE EMPTY.” IT IS THE LIFE THAT IS ASBRIGHT AS LIGHT BUT DOES NOT DAZZLE. IN SHORT, IT IS A LIFE OF HARMONY, UNITY,CONTENTMENT, TRANQUILLITY, CONSTANCY, ENLIGHTENMENT, PEACE, AND LONG LIFE.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S TYPED NOTES ENTITLED “TAOISM,” CIRCA 1963. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.2-FYIN-YANGHARMONY WAS REGARDED AS THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE WORLD ORDER; AS A COSMICFIELD OF FORCE, IN WHICH THE YIN AND THE YANG ARE ETERNALLY COMPLEMENTARY ANDETERNALLY CHANGING. EUROPEAN DUALISM SEES PHYSICAL AND METAPHYSICAL AS TWOSEPARATE ENTITIES, AT BEST AS CAUSE AND EFFECT, BUT NEVER PAIRED LIKE SOUND ANDECHO, OR LIGHT AND SHADOW, AS IN THE CHINESE SYMBOL OF ALL HAPPENING: THE YINAND THE YANG.[../Images/45a.jpg]THE DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY REIGNED SUPREME IN EUROPE, DOMINATING THE DEVELOPMENTOF WESTERN SCIENCE. BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF ATOMIC PHYSICS, FINDINGS BASED ONDEMONSTRABLE EXPERIMENTS WERE SEEN TO NEGATE THE DUALISTIC THEORY, AND THE TRENDOF THOUGHT SINCE THEN HAS BEEN BACK TOWARD THE MONISTIC CONCEPTION OF THEANCIENT TAOISTS.IN ATOMIC PHYSICS NO DISTINCTION IS RECOGNIZED BETWEEN MATTER AND ENERGY; NOR ISIT POSSIBLE TO MAKE SUCH A DISTINCTION, SINCE THEY ARE IN REALITY ONE ESSENCE,OR AT LEAST TWO POLES OF THE SAME UNIT. IT IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE, AS IT WAS INTHE MECHANISTIC SCIENTIFIC ERA, TO ABSOLUTELY DEFINE WEIGHT, LENGTH, OR TIME,AND SO FORTH, AS THE WORK OF EINSTEIN, PLANCK, WHITEHEAD, AND JEANS HASDEMONSTRATED.IN THE SAME WAY, THE TAOIST PHILOSOPHY, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF WHICHACUPUNCTURE HAD ITS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPED, IS ESSENTIALLY MONISTIC. THE CHINESECONCEIVED THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS ACTIVATED BY TWO PRINCIPLES, THE YANG AND THEYIN, THE POSITIVE AND THE NEGATIVE, AND THEY CONSIDERED THAT NOTHING THATEXISTS, EITHER ANIMATE OR SO-CALLED INANIMATE, EXISTS EXCEPT BY VIRTUE OF THECEASELESS INTERPLAY OF THESE TWO FORCES. MATTER AND ENERGY, YANG AND YIN, HEAVENAND EARTH, ARE CONCEIVED OF AS ESSENTIALLY ONE OR AS TWO COEXISTENT POLES OF ONEINDIVISIBLE WHOLE.GUNG FU, THE OLDEST FORM OF SELF-DEFENSE, CAN WELL BE TERMED THE CONCENTRATEDESSENCE OF WISDOM AND PROFOUND THOUGHT ON THE ART OF SELF-DEFENSE. IT HAS NEVERBEEN SURPASSED IN TERMS COMPREHENSIVENESS AND DEPTH OF UNDERSTANDING. GUNG FUMEANS “TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE TO DISCOVER THE TRUE WAY TO THE OBJECT”—BE IT THEWAY OF HEALTH PROMOTION, THE WAY OF SPIRITUAL CULTIVATION, OR THE WAY OFSELF-DEFENSE.THE OBJECT OF GUNG FU, THEN, IS TO PROMOTE HEALTH, CULTIVATE MIND ANDSELF-PROTECTION. ITS PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THEPHILOSOPHIES OF TAOISM, CH’AN (ZEN), AND THE I’CHING (BOOK OF CHANGES)—THE IDEALOF GIVING WITH ADVERSITY, TO BEND SLIGHTLY AND SPRING BACK STRONGER THAN BEFORE,AND TO ADAPT ONESELF HARMONIOUSLY TO THE OPPONENT’S MOVEMENTS WITHOUT STRIVINGOR RESISTING. GUNG FU CAN BE SAID TO BE THE CHINESE ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER THEMYSTERIES OF NATURE.HARMONY AND CALMNESS DISTINGUISH THE CHINESE ART OF GUNG FU. A GUNG FU MANREJECTS ALL FORMS OF SELF-ASSERTIVENESS AND COMPETITION, AND HE PRACTICES THEART OF SELF-FORGETFULNESS—TO DETACH NOT ONLY FROM HIS OPPONENT BUT FROM HIS“SELF.”BEING YIELDING AND DEVOTED MUST NOT EXCLUDE HAVING STRENGTH, FOR STRENGTH ISNECESSARY TO THE SOFTNESS IF IT IS TO BE THE HELPER OF THE FIRMNESS. IF THERECEPTIVE WERE TO PUSH AHEAD ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE, IT WOULD DEVIATE FROM ITSNATURAL CHARACTER AND MISS THE WAY. BY SUBMITTING TO AND FOLLOWING THE CREATIVE,IT ATTAINS ITS APPROPRIATE PERMANENT PLACE. BECAUSE THE RECEPTIVE IN ITSMOVEMENT ADAPTS ITSELF TO THE CREATIVE, THESE MOVEMENTS COME TO BE.

BRUCE LEEPAPERS.2-GWU-HSIN (NO-MINDEDNESS)THE WAY OF MOVEMENT IN GUNG FU IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND.IN FACT, THE MIND IS TRAINED TO DIRECT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY. THE MIND WILLSAND THE BODY BEHAVES.TO PERFORM THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE IN GUNG FU, PHYSICAL LOOSENING MUST BE CONTINUEDIN A MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL LOOSENING SO AS TO MAKE THE MIND NOT ONLY AGILE BUTFREE. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, A GUNG FU MAN HAS TO REMAIN QUIET AND CALMAND TO MASTER THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-MINDEDNESS (WU-SHIN).[../Images/47a.jpg]NO-MINDEDNESS IS NOT A BLANK MIND THAT EXCLUDES ALL EMOTIONS; NOR IS IT SIMPLYCALLOUSNESS AND QUIETNESS OF MIND. ALTHOUGH QUIETUDE AND CALMNESS ARE NECESSARY,IT IS THE “NON-GRASPINESS” OF THE MIND THAT MAINLY CONSTITUTES THE PRINCIPLE OFNO-MINDEDNESS. A GUNG FU MAN EMPLOYS HIS MIND AS A MIRROR—IT GRASPS NOTHING, YETIT REFUSES NOTHING; IT RECEIVES, BUT DOES NOT KEEP. AS ALAN WATTS PUTS IT, THENO-MINDEDNESS IS “A STATE OF WHOLENESS IN WHICH THE MIND FUNCTIONS FREELY ANDEASILY, WITHOUT THE SENSATION OF A SECOND MIND OR EGO STANDING OVER IT WITH ACLUB.”19 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_19] WHAT HE MEANS IS THAT ONE LETS THE MINDTHINK WHAT IT LIKES WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE BY THE SEPARATE THINKER OR EGOWITHIN ONESELF.THE WAY OF MOVEMENT IN GUNG FU IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND.IN FACT, THE MIND IS TRAINED TO DIRECT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY. THE MIND WILLSAND THE BODY BEHAVES.SO LONG AS IT THINKS WHAT IT WANTS, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT IN LETTING ITGO; AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EFFORT TO LET GO IS PRECISELY THE DISAPPEARANCEOF THE SEPARATE THINKER. THERE IS NOTHING TO TRY TO DO, FOR WHATEVER COMES UPMOMENT BY MOMENT IS ACCEPTED, INCLUDING NONACCEPTANCE. NO-MINDEDNESS IS THEN NOTBEING WITHOUT EMOTION OR FEELING, BUT BEING ONE IN WHOM FEELING IS NOT STICKY ORBLOCKED. IT IS A MIND IMMUNE TO EMOTIONAL INFLUENCES. “LIKE THIS RIVER,EVERYTHING IS FLOWING ON CEASELESSLY WITHOUT CESSATION OR STANDING STILL.”NO-MINDEDNESS IS EMPLOYING THE WHOLE MIND AS WE USE THE EYES WHEN WE REST THEMUPON VARIOUS OBJECTS BUT MAKE NO SPECIAL EFFORT TO TAKE ANYTHING IN. CHUANG-TZU,THE DISCIPLE OF LAO-TZU, STATED:> THE BABY LOOKS AT THINGS ALL DAY WITHOUT WINKING, THAT IS BECAUSE HIS EYES ARE> NOT FOCUSED ON ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT. HE GOES WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE IS> GOING, AND STOPS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE IS DOING. HE MERGES HIMSELF WITH THE> SURROUNDINGS AND MOVES ALONG WITH IT. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF MENTAL> HYGIENE.20 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_20]THEREFORE, CONCENTRATION IN GUNG FU DOES NOT HAVE THE USUAL SENSE OF RESTRICTINGTHE ATTENTION TO A SINGLE SENSE OBJECT, BUT IS SIMPLY A QUIET AWARENESS OFWHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE HERE AND NOW. SUCH QUIET AWARENESS CAN BE ILLUSTRATED BYAN AUDIENCE AT A FOOTBALL GAME; INSTEAD OF A CONCENTRATED ATTENTION ON THEPLAYER THAT HAS THE BALL, THEY HAVE AN AWARENESS OF THE WHOLE FOOTBALL FIELD.IN A SIMILAR WAY, A GUNG FU MAN’S MIND IS CONCENTRATED BY NOT DWELLING ON ANYPARTICULAR PART OF THE OPPONENT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN ONE IS DEALINGWITH MORE THAN ONE OR TWO OPPONENTS. FOR INSTANCE, SUPPOSE TEN MEN ARE ATTACKINGA PERSON, EACH IN SUCCESSION, READY TO STRIKE HIM DOWN. AS SOON AS ONE ISDISPOSED OF, HE WILL MOVE ON TO ANOTHER WITHOUT PERMITTING THE MIND TO “STOP”WITH ANY. HOWEVER RAPIDLY THE BLOWS MAY FOLLOW ONE UPON ANOTHER HE LEAVES NOTIME TO INTERVENE BETWEEN THE TWO. EVERY ONE OF THE TEN WILL THUS BESUCCESSIVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH. THIS IS POSSIBLE ONLY WHEN THE MINDMOVES FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING “STOPPED” OR ARRESTED BYANYTHING. IF THE MIND IS UNABLE TO FLOW ON IN THIS FASHION, IT IS SURE TO LOSETHE COMBAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO ENCOUNTERS.A GUNG FU MAN’S MIND IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE ATTACHED TO ANYPARTICULAR OBJECT. AND IT CAN REMAIN PRESENT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN RELATED TO THISOR THAT OBJECT, IT DOES NOT CLING TO IT. THE FLOW OF THOUGHT IS LIKE WATERFILLING A POND, WHICH IS ALWAYS READY TO FLOW OFF AGAIN. IT CAN WORK ITSINEXHAUSTIBLE POWER BECAUSE IT IS FREE, AND IT CAN BE OPEN TO EVERYTHING BECAUSEIT IS EMPTY. THIS CAN BE COMPARED WITH WHAT CHANG CHEN CHI CALLED “SERENEREFLECTION”: “SERENE MEANS TRANQUILLITY OF NO THOUGHT, AND REFLECTION MEANSVIVID AND CLEAR AWARENESS. THEREFORE, SERENE REFLECTION IS CLEAR AWARENESS OF NOTHOUGHT.”21 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_21]A GUNG FU MAN’S MIND IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE ATTACHED TO ANYPARTICULAR OBJECT. AND IT CAN REMAIN PRESENT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN RELATED TO THISOR THAT OBJECT, IT DOES NOT CLING TO IT.NOT TO LOCALIZE OR PARTIALIZE IS THE END OF SPIRITUAL TRAINING. WHEN IT ISNOWHERE ATTACHED IT IS EVERYWHERE. WHEN IT OCCUPIES ONE-TENTH, IT IS ABSENT INTHE OTHER NINE-TENTHS. THE GUNG FU MAN SHOULD DISCIPLINE HIMSELF TO HAVE THEMIND GO ON ITS OWN WAY, INSTEAD OF TRYING DELIBERATELY TO CONFINE IT SOMEWHERE.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ENTITLED “NO-MINDEDNESS.” BRUCE LEEPAPERS.2-HWU WEI (NON-ACTION)A GUNG FU MAN AIMS AT HARMONY WITH HIMSELF AND HIS OPPONENT. TO BE IN HARMONYWITH HIS OPPONENT IS POSSIBLE NOT THROUGH FORCE, WHICH PROVOKES CONFLICTS ANDREACTIONS, BUT THROUGH A YIELDING TO HIS FORCE.IN OTHER WORDS, A GUNG FU MAN PROMOTES THE SPONTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT OF HISOPPONENT AND DOES NOT VENTURE TO INTERFERE BY HIS OWN ACTION. HE LOSES HIMSELFBY GIVING UP ALL SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS AND INDIVIDUALITY, AND BY BECOMING ONE WITHHIS OPPONENT. INSIDE HIS MIND, OPPOSITIONS HAVE BECOME MUTUALLY COOPERATIVEINSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. WHEN HIS PRIVATE EGO AND CONSCIOUS EFFORT YIELDTO A POWER THAT IS NOT HIS OWN, HE THEN ACHIEVES THE HIGHEST ACTION IN GUNG FU,THE ACTION OF NO ACTION—WU WEI.WU MEANS “NOT” OR “NON,” AND WEI MEANS “ACTION,” “DOING,” “STRIVING,”“STRAINING,” OR “BUSYNESS.” HOWEVER, IT DOESN’T REALLY MEAN DOING NOTHING, BUTTO LET ONE’S MIND ALONE, TRUSTING IT TO WORK BY ITSELF. THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGIS NOT TO STRAIN IN ANY WAY.WU WEI, IN GUNG FU, MEANS “SPIRIT OR MIND ACTION,” IN THE SENSE THAT THEGOVERNING FORCE IS THE MIND, NOT THE SENSES. DURING SPARRING A GUNG FU MANLEARNS TO FORGET ABOUT HIMSELF AND FOLLOWS THE MOVEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT, LEAVINGHIS MIND FREE TO MAKE ITS OWN COUNTERMOVEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTERFERINGDELIBERATION. HE FREES HIMSELF FROM ALL MENTAL SUGGESTIONS OF RESISTANCE ANDADOPTS A SUPPLE ATTITUDE. HIS ACTIONS ARE ALL PERFORMED WITHOUT SELF-ASSERTION;HE LETS HIS MIND REMAIN SPONTANEOUS AND UNGRASPED. AS SOON AS HE STOPS TO THINK,HIS FLOW OF MOVEMENT WILL BE DISTURBED, AND HE WILL IMMEDIATELY BE STRUCK BY HISOPPONENT. EVERY ACTION, THEREFORE, HAS TO BE DONE “UNINTENTIONALLY” WITHOUT EVERTRYING.THE NATURAL PHENOMENON WITH THE CLOSEST RESEMBLANCE TO WU WEI IS WATER: WATER ISTHE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD, YET IT CAN PENETRATE THE HARDEST. WATER ISSO FINE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT; STRIKE IT, YET IT DOESNOT SUFFER HURT; STAB IT, AND IT IS NOT WOUNDED; SEVER IT, YET IT IS NOTDIVIDED. IT HAS NO SHAPE OF ITS OWN, BUT MOLDS ITSELF TO THE RECEPTACLE THATCONTAINS IT.WU WEI IS THE ART OF ARTLESSNESS, THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-PRINCIPLE. TO STATE IT INTERMS OF GUNG FU, THE GENUINE BEGINNER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE WAY OF BLOCKINGAND STRIKING, AND MUCH LESS OF HIS CONCERN FOR HIMSELF. WHEN THE OPPONENT TRIESTO STRIKE HIM, HE INSTINCTIVELY BLOCKS IT. THIS IS ALL HE CAN DO. BUT AS SOON ASTHE TRAINING STARTS, HE IS TAUGHT HOW TO DEFEND AND ATTACK, WHERE TO KEEP HISMIND, AND MANY OTHER TECHNICAL SKILLS—WHICH MAKE HIS MIND “STOP” AT VARIOUSJUNCTURES. FOR THIS REASON WHENEVER HE TRIES TO STRIKE THE OPPONENT HE FEELSUNUSUALLY HAMPERED. HE HAS LOST ALTOGETHER HIS ORIGINAL SENSE OF PURITY ANDFREEDOM. BUT AS MONTHS AND YEARS GO BY, AS HIS TRAINING ACQUIRES FULLERMATURITY, HIS BODILY ATTITUDE AND HIS WAY OF MANAGING THE TECHNIQUES TOWARDNO-MINDEDNESS, WILL RESEMBLE THE STATE OF MIND HE HAD AT THE VERY BEGINNING OFTRAINING WHEN HE KNEW NOTHING, WHEN HE WAS ALTOGETHER IGNORANT OF GUNG FU.WU WEI IS THE ART OF ARTLESSNESS, THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-PRINCIPLE.TO STATE IT INTERMS OF GUNG FU, THE GENUINE BEGINNER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE WAY OF BLOCKINGAND STRIKING, AND MUCH LESS OF HIS CONCERN FOR HIMSELF.THE BEGINNING AND THE END THUS TURN INTO NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS. IN THE MUSICALSCALE, ONE MAY START WITH THE LOWEST PITCH AND GRADUALLY ASCEND TO THE HIGHEST.WHEN THE HIGHEST IS REACHED, ONE FINDS IT IS LOCATED NEXT TO THE LOWEST.

THUS, AND HENCE AND CONSEQUENTLY AND THEREFORE, IF ONEREMOVES THE FIRST PREMISE OF AQUINAS ON MOTION, ONE IS TRAPPED INTO THE SECONDPREMISE ON EFFICIENT CAUSE, AND SO TO THE THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH ARGUMENTS.WHAT IS DISTURBING ABOUT THESE ARGUMENTS (DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY EARLYSCHOOLING IN HONG KONG WAS DIRECTED ALONG THESE LINES BY ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS)IS THE OVERWHELMING FACT THAT I CAN EITHER ACCEPT THEM OR REJECT THEM REGARDLESSOF THEIR VALIDITY.TO EXPERIENCE PAIN, FOR EXAMPLE, DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ONE UNDERSTANDSIT, ACCEPTS IT, OR EVEN FOR THAT MATTER DENIES ITS EXISTENCE: IT IS. BUT IT DOESNOT FOLLOW THAT EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND PAIN IN THE SAME WAY AND ARRIVE AT THESAME CONCLUSION. ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE MEDICALPROFESSION.HOWEVER, WHEN I SAY THAT PAIN “IS,” IT DOES IMPLY THAT I AM EXPERIENCING SOMETHING, BUT TO RELATE THIS THING TO SOMEONE OTHER THAN MYSELF SEEMS TO BE WHERETHE DIFFICULTY LIES. IT IS, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN A SEMANTIC DIFFICULTY—IT IS ANIMPOSSIBILITY. SEMANTICALLY WE ALL RESPOND TO A GIVEN IDEA, CONCEPT, OR WORD INMUCH THE SAME WAY: THAT IS, IF THE CONCEPT, IDEA OR WORD IS IN OUR OWN NATIVELANGUAGE.TO EXPERIENCE PAIN, FOR EXAMPLE, DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT ONE UNDERSTANDSIT, ACCEPTS IT, OR EVEN FOR THAT MATTER DENIES ITS EXISTENCE: IT IS. BUT IT DOESNOT FOLLOW THAT EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND PAIN IN THE SAME WAY AND ARRIVE AT THESAME CONCLUSION.HOWEVER, WHEN A WESTERN MAN REASONS, HE MAKES DISTINCTIONS THAT WOULD BEIMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CHINESE MAN TO MAKE—IN FACT, THE CHINESE WOULD NOT EVENCONSIDER “DISTINCTION” AS A PART OF THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS. THE CHINESE LOOKS ATTHINGS AS ESSENTIALLY ONE, OR AS TWO COEXISTENT PARTS OF ONE INDIVISIBLE WHOLE.THEIR MEANING (WHATEVER THE THINGS HAPPEN TO BE) IS DERIVED FROM EACH OTHER ANDTHEIR COMPLETION THROUGH EACH OTHER. THEREFORE, INSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,THEY ARE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT AND ARE A FUNCTION EACH OF THE OTHER.IN THE CHINESE LANGUAGE, FOR INSTANCE, EVENTS ARE LOOKED ON AS A WHOLE;THEREFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRY TO THINK OF A CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP.FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHARACTER FOR “GOOD” IS [../Images/p1.jpg] AND THAT OF “BAD”[../Images/p2.jpg]. WHEN COMBINED TOGETHER [../Images/p3.jpg] THE WORD QUALITYIS FORMED. IN ORDER TO FORM THE WHOLE WORD QUALITY, HALF OF THE POSITIVE OF[../Images/p4.jpg] IS NECESSARY. [../Images/p5.jpg] IS THE CHARACTER FOR “LONG,”AND [../Images/p6.jpg], THE CHARACTER FOR “SHORT,” AND TOGETHER IT (LONG/SHORT)MEANS THE LENGTH OF SOMETHING. THE CHARACTER FOR “BUYING” [../Images/p7.jpg] ANDTHAT FOR “SELLING,” [../Images/p8.jpg] COMBINE TOGETHER TO FORM THE NEW WORDTRADE.INSTEAD OF BEING OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER, THINGS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, ANDCOMPLEMENTARIES COEXIST. THEY ARE NOT VIEWED AS CAUSE AND EFFECT BUT ARE PAIREDLIKE SOUND AND ECHO OR LIGHT AND SHADOW. SO IN ORDER FOR A BICYCLIST TO MOVEFORWARD THE ONE INSEPARABLE FORCE OF ONE’S UNCEASING INTERPLAY OF PUMPING ANDRELEASING IS REQUIRED.NOW WHEN AQUINAS BEGINS HIS ARGUMENT HE PRESUPPOSES BEING OR EXISTENCE, FOR TOTALK IN TERMS OF MOTION IMPLIES THAT SOMETHING EXISTS; THAT IS, [THAT] SOMETHING IS IN MOTION. WHAT AQUINAS IS ASKING, THEN, IN ARTICLE THREE, IS FOR ME TOACCEPT FROM HIS “CAN OF PAINT” THE ABSOLUTE BEING THAT HE CONCEIVES OF AS GOD.I PREFER TO LOOK UPON AQUINAS’S DOCTRINE AS AN ACT OF FAITH RATHER THAN“REASON.” I CANNOT AND WILL NOT “SCOFF” AT FAITH WHEN REASON SEEMS TO BE SUCH ABARREN THING. THE CHINESE REALIZE THAT THE HIGHEST TRUTH IS INEXPRESSIBLE, ANDINSTEAD TO STRIVE, TO PRESUPPOSE, TO SEPARATE SELF THEY CEASE ALL SEEKING ANDALL MIND ACTIVITY IN THE NATURE OF CLINGING OR GRASPING DIRECTED ATSELF-ASSERTION OR SPIRITUAL GAIN; HE SIMPLY IS BEING WHAT IS.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN PHILOSOPHY ESSAY ENTITLED “ANY COLOR I WANT?”UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON, CIRCA 1964.

THERE ARE MANY OF THESE KINDS OF WAYS TO REMAIN INTACT, BUT ALWAYS ONLY ATTHE COST OF DISOWNING MANY, MANY VALUABLE PARTS OF OURSELVES. THE FACT THAT WELIVE ONLY ON SUCH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF OUR POTENTIAL IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WEARE NOT WILLING—OR SOCIETY OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, IS NOT WILLING—TOACCEPT MYSELF, YOURSELF, AS THE ORGANISM THAT YOU ARE BY BIRTH, CONSTITUTION,AND SO ON.YOU DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF—OR YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED—TO BE TOTALLY YOURSELF. SO YOUREGO BOUNDARY SHRINKS MORE AND MORE. YOUR POWER, YOUR ENERGY BECOMES SMALLER ANDSMALLER. YOUR ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE WORLD BECOMES LESS AND LESS—AND MORE ANDMORE RIGID, MORE AND MORE ALLOWED ONLY TO COPE AS YOUR CHARACTER, AS YOURPRECONCEIVED PATTERN, PRESCRIBES IT.A LIVING ORGANISM IS AN ORGANISM THAT CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OFPROCESSES THAT REQUIRE INTERCHANGE WITH OTHER MEDIA OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY OF THEORGANISM. SO SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN TO GET THROUGH THE BOUNDARY, AND THIS ISWHAT WE CALL CONTACT.WE TOUCH, WE GET IN CONTACT, AND WE STRETCH OUR BOUNDARY OUT TO THE THING INQUESTION. IF WE ARE RIGID AND CAN’T MOVE, THEN IT REMAINS THERE.WHEN WE LIVE, WE SPEND ENERGIES; WE NEED ENERGIES TO MAINTAIN THIS MACHINE. THISPROCESS OF EXCHANGE IS CALLED THE METABOLISM. BOTH THE METABOLISM OF THEEXCHANGE OF OUR ORGANISM WITH THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE METABOLISM WITHIN OURORGANISM, IS GOING ON CONTINUALLY, DAY AND NIGHT.A GESTALT IS AN ORGANIC FUNCTION (WALKING—THIRST—WALKING)— THIS SITUATION IS NOWCLOSED, AND THE NEXT UNFINISHED SITUATION CAN TAKE PLACE, WHICH MEANS OUR LIFEIS BASICALLY PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF UNFINISHEDSITUATIONS—INCOMPLETE GESTALTS.

BECAUSE WITH FULL AWARENESS YOU BECOMEAWARE OF THIS ORGANISMIC SELF-REGULATION; YOU CAN LET THE ORGANISM TAKE OVERWITHOUT INTERFERING, WITHOUT INTERRUPTING; WE CAN RELY ON THE WISDOM OF THEORGANISM. AND THE CONTRAST TO THIS IS THE WHOLE PATHOLOGY OF SELF-MANIPULATION,ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL, AND SO ON, WHICH INTERFERES WITH THIS SUBTLE ORGANISMICSELF-CONTROL.BECAUSE WITH FULL AWARENESS YOU BECOME AWARE OF THIS ORGANISMIC SELF-REGULATION;YOU CAN LET THE ORGANISM TAKE OVER WITHOUT INTERFERING, WITHOUT INTERRUPTING; WECAN RELY ON THE WISDOM OF THE ORGANISM.[../Images/77a.jpg]OUR MANIPULATION OF OURSELVES IS USUALLY DIGNIFIED BY THE WORD “CONSCIENCE,”WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A FANTASY, A PROJECTION ONTO THE PARENTS.

HE ISSOMETIMES RIGHT, BUT ALWAYS RIGHTEOUS. THE TOP DOG IS A BULLY AND WORKS WITH“YOU SHOULD” AND “YOU SHOULD NOT.” THE TOP DOG MANIPULATES WITH DEMANDS ANDTHREATS OF CATASTROPHE, SUCH AS, “IF YOU DON’T … THEN— YOU WON’T BE LOVED, YOUWON’T GET TO HEAVEN, YOU WILL DIE,” AND SO ON.THE UNDERDOGTHE UNDERDOG MANIPULATES WITH BEING DEFENSIVE, APOLOGETIC, WHEEDLING, PLAYINGTHE CRYBABY, AND SUCH. THE UNDERDOG HAS NO POWER. THE UNDERDOG IS MICKEY MOUSE.THE TOP DOG IS THE SUPER-MOUSE. AND THE UNDERDOG WORKS LIKE THIS: “I TRY MYBEST,” “LOOK, I TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN. I CAN’T HELP IT IF I FAIL.” “I HAVE SUCHGOOD INTENTIONS.” SO YOU SEE THE UNDERDOG IS CUNNING, AND HE USUALLY GETS THEBETTER OF THE TOP DOG BECAUSE THE UNDERDOG IS NOT AS PRIMITIVE AS THE TOP DOG.SO THE TOP DOG AND UNDERDOG STRIVE FOR CONTROL. LIKE EVERY PARENT AND CHILD,THEY STRIVE WITH EACH OTHER FOR CONTROL. THE PERSON IS FRAGMENTED INTOCONTROLLER AND CONTROLLED. THIS INNER CONFLICT, THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TOP DOGAND UNDERDOG, IS NEVER COMPLETE, BECAUSE THE TOP DOG AS WELL AS THE UNDERDOGFIGHTS FOR HIS LIFE.THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE FAMOUS SELF-TORTURE GAME. WE USUALLY TAKE FOR GRANTEDTHAT THE TOP DOG IS RIGHT, AND IN MANY CASES THE TOP DOG MAKES IMPOSSIBLEPERFECTIONISTIC DEMANDS. SO IF YOU ARE CURSED WITH PERFECTIONISM, THEN YOU’REABSOLUTELY SUNK. THIS IDEAL IS A YARDSTICK WHICH ALWAYS GIVES YOU THEOPPORTUNITY TO BROWBEAT YOURSELF, TO BERATE YOURSELF AND OTHERS. SINCE THISIDEAL IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY, YOU CAN NEVER LIVE UP TO IT. YOU ARE MERELY IN LOVEWITH THIS IDEAL, AND THERE IS NO END TO THE SELF-TORTURE, TO THE SELF-NAGGING,SELF-CASTIGATING. IT HIDES UNDER THE MASK OF “SELF-IMPROVEMENT.” IT NEVER WORKS.IF THE PERSON TRIES TO MEET THE TOP DOG’S DEMANDS OF PERFECTIONISM, THE RESULTIS A “NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,” OR FLIGHT INTO INSANITY. THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS OFTHE UNDERDOG. ONCE WE RECOGNIZE THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BEHAVIOR, WHICH IN THE CASEOF SELF-IMPROVEMENT IS THE SPLIT BETWEEN THE TOP DOG AND THE UNDERDOG, ANDUNDERSTAND HOW, BY LISTENING, WE CAN BRING ABOUT A RECONCILIATION OF THESE TWOFIGHTING CLOWNS, THEN WE REALIZE THAT WE CANNOT DELIBERATELY BRING ABOUT CHANGESIN OURSELVES OR IN OTHERS.THIS IS A VERY DECISIVE POINT: MANY PEOPLE DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO ACTUALIZING ACONCEPT OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE LIKE, RATHER THAN ACTUALIZING THEMSELVES. THISDIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELF-ACTUALIZING AND SELF-IMAGE ACTUALIZING IS VERYIMPORTANT. MOST PEOPLE ONLY LIVE FOR THEIR IMAGE.WHERE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A SELF, MOST PEOPLE HAVE A VOID, BECAUSE THEY ARE SO BUSYPROJECTING THEMSELVES AS THIS OR THAT. THIS IS AGAIN THE CURSE OF THE IDEAL. THECURSE IS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE WHAT YOU ARE. EVERY EXTERNAL CONTROL, EVENINTERNALIZED EXTERNAL CONTROL—“YOU SHOULD”—INTERFERES WITH THE HEALTHY WORKINGOF THE ORGANISM. THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT SHOULD CONTROL THE SITUATION. IFYOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION THAT YOU ARE IN, AND LET THE SITUATION THAT YOU AREIN CONTROL YOUR ACTIONS, THEN YOU LEARN HOW TO COPE WITH LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, YOUDON’T DRIVE ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM, YOU DRIVE ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION (SAMETHING IN COMBAT). YOU DRIVE A DIFFERENT SPEED WHEN YOU ARE TIRED, WHEN IT’SRAINING, AND SO FORTH.THE LESS CONFIDENT WE ARE IN OURSELVES, THE LESS WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH OURSELVESAND THE WORLD, THE MORE WE WANT TO CONTROL.NOW = EXPERIENCE = AWARENESS = REALITYGESTALT THERAPY = PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH (AWARENESS OF WHAT IS) + BEHAVIORALAPPROACH (BEHAVIOR IN THE NOW).SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN NOTES ENTITLED “THE TOP DOG AND THE UNDERDOG,”WITHIN MISC.

ANDWHEN IT COMES TO THE MOMENT OF PERFORMANCE, AND YOU’RE NOT SURE WHETHER YOURPERFORMANCE WILL BE WELL RECEIVED, THEN YOU GET STAGE FRIGHT.THIS STAGE FRIGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN BY PSYCHIATRY THE NAME “ANXIETY.” “WHAT WILL IHAVE TO SAY ON THE EXAMINATION?” “WHAT WILL I SAY IN MY LECTURE?” YOU MEET AGIRL AND THINK, “WHAT WILL I HAVE TO WEAR TO IMPRESS HER?” AND SO ON. ALL THISIS REHEARSING FOR THE ROLE YOU PLAY.THINKING IS REHEARSING IN FANTASY FOR THE ROLE YOU HAVE TO PLAY IN SOCIETY.

IF YOU CAN STAY WITH THIS, YOU WILL SOON COME ACROSS SOME EXPERIENCETHAT IS UNPLEASANT—THIS CRITICAL MOMENT IS THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTION OF WHATEVERWE EXPERIENCE IN THE NOW. THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE AWARENESS CONTINUUM PREVENTSMATURATION, PREVENTS THERAPY FROM BECOMING SUCCESSFUL, PREVENTS MARRIAGE FROMBECOMING RICHER AND DEEPER, AND PREVENTS INNER CONFLICTS FROM BEING RESOLVED.THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS AVOIDANCE TENDENCY IS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO (WHATIS THE STATUS QUO? THE STATUS QUO IS HOLDING ON TO THE CONCEPT THAT WE ARECHILDREN). WE ARE INFANTILE BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IN THENOW. TO TAKE OUR PLACE IN HISTORY, TO BE MATURE, MEANS GIVING UP THE CONCEPTTHAT WE HAVE PARENTS, THAT WE HAVE TO BE SUBMISSIVE OR DEFIANT, OR THE OTHERVARIATIONS ON THE CHILD’S ROLE THAT WE PLAY.MATURATION IS THE DEVELOPMENT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT TO SELF-SUPPORT.HOWEVER THE NEUROTIC CHILD WILL USE HIS POTENTIAL, NOT FOR SELF-SUPPORT BUT TOACT OUT PHONY ROLES. THESE PHONY ROLES ARE MEANT TO MOBILIZE THE ENVIRONMENT FORSUPPORT INSTEAD OF MOBILIZING ONE’S OWN POTENTIAL. WE MANIPULATE THE ENVIRONMENTBY BEING HELPLESS, BY STAYING STUPID, ASKING QUESTIONS, WHEEDLING FLATTERING—THERESULT IS THAT WE COME TO THE STICKING POINT OR THE IMPASSE.THE IMPASSE OCCURS WHEN WE CANNOT PRODUCE OUR OWN SUPPORT AND WHEN ENVIRONMENTALSUPPORT IS NOT FORTHCOMING. ONE PERSON HAS NO EYES, ANOTHER NO EARS, ANOTHER NOLEGS TO STAND ON, ANOTHER NO PERSPECTIVE, ANOTHER NO EMOTION. IN ORDER TO FILLTHESE VOIDS, WHICH ARE USUALLY EXPERIENCED AS BOREDOM WITH LIFE, EMPTINESS,LONELINESS, WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE IMPASSE AND THROUGH THE FRUSTRATIONS OFTHE IMPASSE, WHICH USUALLY LEAD US TO SHORTCUT THE FRUSTRATIONS AND WITH THEMTHE WHOLE LEARNING PROCESS.WE MANIPULATE THE ENVIRONMENT BY BEING HELPLESS, BY STAYING STUPID, ASKINGQUESTIONS, WHEEDLING FLATTERING— THE RESULT IS THAT WE COME TO THE STICKINGPOINT OR THE IMPASSE.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN NOTES, UNTITLED, CONTAINED WITHIN MISC.

THENYOU FEED THIS INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU PLAY THE FITTING GAME. DOES THISCONCEPT FIT IN WITH THESE OTHER CONCEPTS?HOWEVER, THE BEST WAY OF LEARNING IS NOT THROUGH THE COMPUTATION OF INFORMATION.LEARNING IS DISCOVERING, UNCOVERING WHAT IS THERE IN US. WHEN WE DISCOVER, WEARE UNCOVERING OUR OWN ABILITY, OUR OWN EYES, IN ORDER TO FIND OUR POTENTIAL, TOSEE WHAT IS GOING ON, TO DISCOVER HOW WE CAN ENLARGE OUR LIVES, TO FIND THEMEANS AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT WILL LET US COPE WITH A DIFFICULT SITUATION. AND ALLTHIS, I MAINTAIN, IS TAKING PLACE IN THE HERE AND NOW.ANY SPECULATION ABOUT THINGS, ANY ATTEMPT AT GETTING INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCEFROM OUTSIDE HELP WILL NOT PRODUCE MATURATION. SO ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH ME HASTO DO IT WITH A CONTINUOUS ACCOUNT OF THE NOW. “I AM EXPERIENCING THIS; NOW IFEEL THIS; NOW I DON’T WANT TO WORK ANYMORE; NOW I AM BORED.” FROM HERE WE CANGO ON TO DIFFERENTIATE WHAT OF THE NOW EXPERIENCE IS ACCEPTABLE TO YOU, WHEN YOUWANT TO RUN AWAY, WHEN YOU ARE WILLING TO SUFFER YOURSELF, WHEN YOU FEELYOURSELF BEING SUFFERED, AND SO ON.

THE IMMEDIATE ANSWER WOULD BE NONEXISTENCE,BUT THIS IS INCORRECT. THE OPPOSITE WOULD BE ANTI-EXISTENCE, JUST AS THEOPPOSITE OF MATTER IS ANTIMATTER. IN SCIENCE WE HAVE FINALLY COME BACK TO THEPRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHER HERACLITUS, WHO SAID THAT EVERYTHING IS FLOW, FLUX,PROCESS. THERE ARE NO “THINGS.” NOTHINGNESS IN EASTERN LANGUAGE IS“NO-THINGNESS.” WE IN THE WEST THINK OF NOTHINGNESS AS A VOID, AN EMPTINESS, ANONEXISTENCE. IN EASTERN PHILOSOPHY AND MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE,NOTHINGNESS—NO-THINGNESS—IS A FORM OF PROCESS, EVER MOVING.WE IN THE WEST THINK OF NOTHINGNESS AS A VOID, AN EMPTINESS, A NONEXISTENCE. INEASTERN PHILOSOPHY AND MODERN PHYSICAL SCIENCE, NOTHINGNESS—NO-THINGNESS—IS AFORM OF PROCESS, EVER MOVING.IN SCIENCE WE TRY TO FIND ULTIMATE MATTER, BUT THE MORE WE SPLIT UP MATTER, THEMORE WE FIND OTHER MATTER. WE FIND MOVEMENT, AND MOVEMENT EQUALS ENERGY:MOVEMENT, IMPACT, ENERGY, BUT NO THINGS. THINGS CAME ABOUT, MORE OR LESS, BYMAN’S NEED FOR SECURITY. YOU CAN MANIPULATE A THING, AND YOU CAN PLAY FITTINGGAMES WITH IT.

REIFICATION, THE MAKINGOF A THING OUT OF A PROCESS, IS THE FUNCTIONING OF WHAT I CALL THE IMPLOSIVE ORCATATONIC OR DEATH LAYER.IF YOU HAVE A BODY, IF YOU HAVE A MIND, THESE THINGS ARE APPARENTLY OBJECTS THATBELONG TO SOME INSTANCE CALLED “I.” “I” AM THE PROUD POSSESSOR—OR THE DESPISINGPOSSESSOR—OF A MIND, OF A BODY, OF A WORLD. SO IN EFFECT I SAY, “I HAVE SOMEBODY” (SOME BODY) RATHER THAN REALIZE THAT I AM SOMEBODY. IN GESTALT THERAPY WELOOK AT THE WAY A PERSON MANIPULATES HIS LANGUAGE, AND WE SEE THAT THE MOREALIENATED HE IS FROM HIMSELF, THE MORE HE WILL USE NOUNS INSTEAD OF VERBS, ANDMOST ESPECIALLY THE WORD “IT.”IT IS A “THING” THAT IS CONVENIENT TO USE TO AVOID BEING ALIVE. WHEN I’M ALIVE,I TALK, I AM “VOICING.” WHEN I AM DEAD, I “HAVE” A VOICE WITH WORDS; THISLANGUAGE WILL HAVE AN EXPRESSION; AND SO FORTH.

THIS IS WHERE ALL THE SHOULD-NOTS THAT I HAVEALREADY DISCUSSED OCCUR.IF WE GET BEHIND THE PHOBIC STATE, THE OBJECTIONS, WE FIND AT THAT MOMENT THEIMPASSE OCCURS. AND WITHIN THE IMPASSE THERE IS THE FEELING OF BEING NOT ALIVE,OF DEADNESS. WE FEEL THAT WE ARE NOTHING, WE ARE THINGS. IN EVERY BIT OF THERAPYWE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS IMPLOSIVE LAYER IN ORDER TO GET TO THE AUTHENTICSELF. THIS IS WHERE MOST SCHOOLS OF THERAPY AND THERAPISTS SHRINK AWAY, BECAUSETHEY ALSO FEAR DEADNESS. OF COURSE, IT IS NOT BEING DEAD, BUT THE FEAR ANDFEELING OF BEING DEAD, OF DISAPPEARING. THE FANTASY IS TAKEN FOR REALITY.IN EVERY BIT OF THERAPY WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS IMPLOSIVE LAYER IN ORDER TOGET TO THE AUTHENTIC SELF. THIS IS WHERE MOST SCHOOLS OF THERAPY AND THERAPISTSSHRINK AWAY, BECAUSE THEY ALSO FEAR DEADNESS.ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE IMPLOSIVE LAYER, WE SEE SOMETHING VERY PECULIARHAPPENING.

HIS COMBATIVE APPROACH WAS NOWPREDICATED—FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY—ON TOTAL FREEDOM FOR THE INDIVIDUALPRACTITIONER. INITIALLY, IN EARLY 1967, JEET KUNE DO (OR JKD, AS LEE OFTENREFERRED TO IT) WAS A NEW APPROACH TO MARTIAL ART THAT WAS BORN OUT OF YEARS OFSCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON LEE’S PART INTO THE HUMAN SCIENCES (KINESIOLOGY,PHYSIOLOGY, AND SO FORTH), AND IT WAS ENVISIONED BY ITS FOUNDER AS A SIMPLE,DIRECT, AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF ALL-OUT COMBAT. HOWEVER, A BACK INJURY LEESUSTAINED (OR PERHAPS, REAGGRAVATED) IN 1970 FORCED HIM TO BE BEDRIDDEN FOR APERIOD OF SEVERAL MONTHS. TEMPORARILY PREVENTED FROM BEING ABLE TO TRAIN HISBODY, LEE WAS ABLE TO TRAIN HIS MIND AS NEVER BEFORE WITH THE RESULT THAT HEAVAILED HIMSELF OF DEEP INSIGHTS INTO THE HUMAN CONDITION WHICH FAR TRANSCENDEDTHE PURELY PHYSICAL OR COMBATIVE REALM.LEE BEGAN TO FIND ANSWERS. HE NOW BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHY HUMANS DO THE THINGSWE DO—INCLUDING FIGHTING; OUR MOTIVATIONS; HOW WE EVOLVE, GROW, AND DEVELOP; ANDWHAT ALL OF OUR DAILY ACTIVITIES ULTIMATELY LEAD TO. THIS CAUSED HIM TO SEE THELIMITATIONS INHERENT IN ANY “SYSTEM” OR “METHOD” OF COMBAT—INCLUDING THE HIGHLYEFFICIENT ONE HE HIMSELF HAD CREATED. LEE BEGAN TO ENVISION THE POSSIBILITY OF AMETHOD OF “NO-METHOD,” A “STYLELESS STYLE,” THAT WOULD RESULT IN UNRESTRICTEDATHLETIC AND SPIRITUAL FREEDOM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PRACTITIONER.ULTIMATELY, THEN, JEET KUNE DO WAS NOT ABOUT A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO SUBDUEONE’S OPPONENT, BUT RATHER IT WAS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO SUBDUE ONESELF; TO RIDONESELF OF HANG-UPS, INSECURITIES, FEARS, AND SUPPRESSED EMOTIONS—ANYTHING, INOTHER WORDS, THAT WOULD BIND THE INDIVIDUAL FROM BECOMING ANYTHING LESS THAN THEFULLEST EXPRESSION OF HIMSELF. BRUCE LEE REALIZED THAT ULTIMATELY A PERSON COULDNOT OBTAIN THE COUNSEL OR HELP HE TRULY REQUIRED FROM ANYBODY BUT HIMSELF,LEADING LEE TO WRITE: “EACH MAN MUST SEEK OUT REALIZATION HIMSELF. NO MASTER CANGIVE IT TO HIM.”24 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_24]WHAT FOLLOWS IN THIS SECTION ARE BRUCE LEE’S COMMENTARIES ON HIS NEW INSIGHTINTO THE HUMAN CONDITION, BEGINNING WITH HIS UNIQUE APPROACH TO COMBAT FORMARTIAL ARTISTS AND ENDING WITH A PRESCRIPTION FOR SPIRITUAL FREEDOM FOR ALLHUMAN BEINGS. INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION ARE EIGHT DRAFTS OF AN ESSAY THAT LEEWENT THROUGH IN PREPARING HIS FIRST PUBLIC DISSERTATION ON HIS NEW BELIEFSYSTEM. THE FINAL DRAFT WAS ULTIMATELY PUBLISHED IN THE SEPTEMBER 1971 EDITIONOF BLACK BELT MAGAZINE UNDER THE TITLE “LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM CLASSICALKARATE.”25 [../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_25] (INCIDENTALLY, THIS ARTICLE WASSUBSEQUENTLY REPRINTED IN THE LEGENDARY BRUCE LEE, PUBLISHED BY OHARAPUBLICATIONS, SANTA CLARITA, CALIFORNIA, AND IT IS WORTH READING TO WITNESS THEFINAL EVOLUTION AND PRESENTATION OF HIS THOUGHT PROCESS.)YOU WILL FIND IN READING THESE VARIOUS DRAFTS THAT NEW IDEAS CAME TO LEE WITHEACH WRITING—ALL OF THEM SIGNIFICANT—AND ALL OF THEM PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONALINSIGHTS AND CONTEXT, FURTHER CLARIFYING HIS VIEWS ON THE ULTIMATE NATURE OFJEET KUNE DO. IT IS ALSO NOTEWORTHY THAT IN HIS ESSAY ENTITLED “THE ULTIMATESOURCE OF JEET KUNE DO” THERE IS NO MENTION WHATSOEVER ABOUT COMBAT—AND THIS, BYLEE’S OWN HAND—IS THE “ULTIMATE SOURCE” OF JEET KUNE DO. THIS MARKS THE FIRSTTIME THAT ALL OF LEE’S ESSAYS ON JEET KUNE DO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED PUBLICLY.5-AJEET KUNE DO: THE WAY OF THE “STOPPING FIST”JEET KUNE DO IS TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE TOWARD THE ULTIMATE REALITY IN COMBAT.THE ULTIMATE REALITY IS RETURNING TO ONE’S PRIMARY FREEDOM, WHICH IS SIMPLE,DIRECT, AND NONCLASSICAL.A GOOD JEET KUNE DO MAN DOES NOT OPPOSE FORCE OR GIVE WAY COMPLETELY. HE ISPLIABLE AS A SPRING; HE IS THE COMPLEMENT AND NOT THE OPPOSITION TO HISOPPONENT’S STRENGTH. HE HAS NO TECHNIQUE; HE MAKES HIS OPPONENT’S TECHNIQUES HISTECHNIQUE.ONE SHOULD RESPOND TO CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL AND “WOODEN”PREARRANGEMENT. ONE’S ACTION SHOULD BE LIKE THE IMMEDIACY OF A SHADOW ADAPTINGTO A MOVING OBJECT. ONE’S TASK IS SIMPLY TO COMPLETE THE OTHER HALF OF THE“ONENESS” SPONTANEOUSLY.[../Images/120a.jpg]IN JEET KUNE DO ONE DOES NOT ACCUMULATE BUT ELIMINATES. IT IS NOT DAILYINCREASE, BUT DAILY DECREASE. THE HEIGHT OF CULTIVATION ALWAYS RUNS TOSIMPLICITY. IT IS THE HALF-WAY CULTIVATION THAT RUNS TO ORNAMENTATION. SO IT ISNOT HOW MUCH FIXED KNOWLEDGE ONE HAS ACCUMULATED; RATHER IT IS WHAT ONE CANAPPLY ALIVELY THAT COUNTS. “BEING” IS DEFINITELY MORE VALUED THAN “DOING.”THE UNDERSTANDING OF JEET KUNE DO COMES THROUGH PERSONAL FEELING FROM MOMENT TOMOMENT IN THE MIRROR OF RELATIONSHIP AND NOT THROUGH A PROCESS OF ISOLATION. TOBE IS TO BE RELATED. TO ISOLATE IS DEATH. ANY TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER WORTHY ANDDESIRABLE, BECOMES A DISEASE, WHEN THE MIND IS OBSESSED WITH IT.LEARN THE PRINCIPLES, ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES, AND THEN DISSOLVE THE PRINCIPLES.IN SHORT, ENTER A MOLD WITHOUT BEING CAGED IN IT, AND OBEY THE PRINCIPLESWITHOUT BEING BOUND BY THEM.THE UNDERSTANDING OF JEET KUNE DO COMES THROUGH PERSONAL FEELING FROM MOMENT TOMOMENT IN THE MIRROR OF RELATIONSHIP AND NOT THROUGH A PROCESS OF ISOLATION.TOBE IS TO BE RELATED.TO ISOLATE IS DEATH.MY FOLLOWERS IN JEET KUNE DO, DO LISTEN TO THIS—ALL FIXED SET PATTERNS AREINCAPABLE OF ADAPTABILITY OR PLIABILITY. THE TRUTH IS OUTSIDE OF ALL FIXEDPATTERNS. TRY TO OBTAIN THE MANAGEABLE SHAPE OF [A] NICELY TIED PAPER PACKAGE OFWATER!WHEN ONE HAS REACHED MATURITY IN THIS ART, ONE WILL HAVE THE FORMLESS FORM. ITIS LIKE THE DISSOLVING OR THAWING [OF] ICE INTO WATER THAT CAN SHAPE ITSELF TOANY STRUCTURE. WHEN ONE HAS NO FORM, ONE CAN BE ALL FORMS; WHEN ONE HAS NOSTYLE, ONE CAN FIT IN WITH ANY STYLE.IN PRIMARY FREEDOM ONE USES ALL WAYS AND IS BOUND BY NONE, AND LIKEWISE ONE USESANY TECHNIQUE OR MEANS THAT SERVES ONE’S END. EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THATSCORES.WHEN YOU PERCEIVE THE TRUTH IN JEET KUNE DO, YOU ARE AT THE UNDIFFERENTIATEDCENTER OF A CIRCLE THAT HAS NO CIRCUMFERENCE.—BRUCE LEEPRESIDENT OF JEET KUNE DOSOURCE: A MIMEOGRAPHED PRINTOUT THAT BRUCE LEE HAD GIVEN OUT TO MEMBERS OF THEL.A. CHINATOWN SCHOOL, CIRCA 1967.5-BTOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION (JEET KUNE DO): IIN THE PAST MANY MATERIALS WERE WRITTEN ON, OR ABOUT JEET KUNE DO, BOTH HERE ANDABROAD, ESPECIALLY IN HONG KONG. HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE ARTICLES TOUCHES ITSCORE; IT IS MERELY A QUESTION OF DEGREE OF ACCURACY. INDEED, IT IS DIFFICULT TOWRITE ABOUT WHAT JEET KUNE DO (JKD) IS, THOUGH IT IS EASIER TO WRITE ON WHAT ITIS NOT.MAYBE TO AVOID MAKING A THING OUT OF A PROCESS, I HAVE NOT YET TO DATE WRITTENAN ARTICLE ON JKD PERSONALLY. TO START THIS ARTICLE, A STORY FROM ZEN SEEMSAPPROPRIATE:> A LEARNED MAN ONCE WENT TO A ZEN MASTER TO INQUIRE ABOUT ZEN. AS THE ZEN> MASTER TALKED, THE LEARNED MAN WOULD FREQUENTLY INTERRUPT HIM WITH REMARKS> LIKE, “OH YES, WE HAVE THAT TOO,” AND SO FORTH. FINALLY THE ZEN MASTER STOPPED> TALKING AND BEGAN TO SERVE TEA TO THE LEARNED MAN; HOWEVER, HE KEPT ON POURING> AND THE TEA CUP OVERFLOWED. “ENOUGH! NO MORE CAN GO INTO THE CUP!” THE LEARNED> MAN INTERRUPTED. “INDEED, I SEE,” ANSWERED THE ZEN MASTER. “IF YOU DO NOT> FIRST EMPTY YOUR CUP, HOW CAN YOU TASTE MY CUP OF TEA?”I HOPE MY COMRADES IN MARTIAL ART WILL READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS WITHOPEN-MINDEDNESS, LEAVING ALL THE BURDENS OF PRECONCEIVED OPINIONS ANDCONCLUSIONS BEHIND; THIS ACT, BY THE WAY, IS IN ITSELF A LIBERATING POWER—AFTERALL, THE USEFULNESS OF A CUP IS IN ITS EMPTINESS.ON THE OTHER HAND, DO RELATE THE MATERIAL TO YOURSELF BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS ONJKD, IT IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE BLOSSOMING OF A MARTIAL ARTIST, AND NOTA “CHINESE” MARTIAL ARTIST, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. ONCE AND FOR ALL LET IT BENOTED THAT A MARTIAL ARTIST IS FIRST A HUMAN BEING, WHICH IS OURSELVES;NATIONALITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MARTIAL ART.TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF SET PATTERNS;FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEM.SUPPOSING SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ARE TRAINED IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF COMBATIVE ARTSHAVE JUST WITNESSED A FIGHT. I AM SURE WE WILL HEAR DIFFERENT VERSIONS FROM EACHOF THEM AFTERWARD. THE CONSEQUENCE IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE, FOR ONE CANNOT SEE AFIGHT “AS IS” BECAUSE ONE WILL “INTERPRET” THE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OFONE’S PARTICULAR CONDITIONING, SAY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BOXER, AWRESTLER, A KARATE STYLIST, A JUDO-KA, A KUNG FU MAN, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINEDIN A PARTICULAR METHOD. THUS EVERY ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE FIGHT IS REALLY APARTIAL IDEA OF THE TOTAL FIGHT, DEPENDING ON ONE’S LIKES AND DISLIKES. FIGHTINGAS IS, SIMPLE AND TOTAL, IS DEFINITELY NOT DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A“CHINESE” MARTIAL ARTIST, A “KOREAN” MARTIAL ARTIST, OR “WHATEVER” KIND OFMARTIAL ARTIST YOU ARE. TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF SETPATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.A STYLE IS A CLASSIFIED RESPONSE TO ONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATION.BEFORE WE LOOK INTO JKD LET’S FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY A CLASSICAL STYLE OF MARTIALART IS. TO BEGIN WITH, WE MUST REALIZE THE ABSOLUTE FACT THAT MAN CREATED STYLE.DISREGARD THE MANY COLORFUL HISTORIES OF THEIR FOUNDERS—BY A WISE MYSTERIOUSMONK, BY SPECIAL MESSENGER IN A DREAM, IN A HOLY REVELATION, FLOODED WITH GOLDENLIGHT, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. A STYLE SHOULD NEVER BE THE GOSPEL TRUTH, THELAWS AND PRINCIPLES OF WHICH CAN NEVER BE VIOLATED. MAN, THE HUMAN BEING, ISALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY STYLE.THE FOUNDER OF A STYLE MAY BE EXPOSED TO SOME PARTIAL TRUTH, BUT AS TIME PASSESBY, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FOUNDER HAS PASSED AWAY, “HIS” POSTULATES, “HIS”INCLINATION, “HIS” CONCLUDING FORMULA—WE CONSTANTLY LEARN, WE NEVERCONCLUDE—BECOME A LAW. CREEDS ARE INVENTED, REINFORCING CEREMONIES AREPRESCRIBED, SEPARATIVE PHILOSOPHIES ARE FORMULATED, AND, FINALLY, THEINSTITUTIONS ARE ERECTED, SO WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF AS SOME SORT OFPERSONAL FLUIDITY OF ITS FOUNDER IS NOW SOLIDIFIED, FIXED KNOWLEDGE—ORGANIZEDAND CLASSIFIED RESPONSE PRESENTED IN LOGICAL ORDER—A PRESERVED CURE-ALL FOR MASSCONDITIONING. IN SO DOING, THE WELL-MEANING FOLLOWERS HAVE MADE THIS KNOWLEDGENOT ONLY A HOLY SHRINE, BUT A TOMB IN WHICH THE FOUNDER’S WISDOM IS BURIED.IF WE HONESTLY LOOK AT THE REALITY OF COMBAT AS IT ACTUALLY IS, AND NOT AS WEWOULD LIKE IT TO BE, I AM SURE WE CANNOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT A STYLE TENDS TOBRING ABOUT ADJUSTMENT, PARTIALITY, DENIALS, CONDEMNATION AND A LOT OFJUSTIFICATION. IN SHORT, THE SOLUTION BEING OFFERED IS THE VERY CAUSE OF THEPROBLEM, PLACING LIMITATIONS AND OBSTACLES ON OUR NATURAL GROWTH ANDCONSEQUENTLY OBSTRUCTING THE WAY TO GENUINE UNDERSTANDING.OF COURSE, AS A DIRECT REACTION TO “THE OTHER TRUTH,” ANOTHER FOUNDER OR MAYBEPOSSIBLY A DISSATISFIED DISCIPLE WOULD “ORGANIZE” AN OPPOSITIONAL APPROACH—AS INTHE CASE OF THE SOFT STYLE VERSUS THE HARD STYLE, THE INTERNAL SCHOOL VERSUS THEEXTERNAL SCHOOL, AND SO FORTH—AND PRETTY SOON IT, TOO, WOULD BECOME A LARGEORGANIZATION WITH ITS OWN SET LAWS AND ITS CHOSEN PATTERN. SO BEGINS THE LONGSTRUGGLE WITH EACH STYLE CLAIMING TO POSSESS THE “TRUTH” TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALLOTHERS. SO WHEREAS THE HUMAN BEING IS TOTAL AND UNIVERSAL—WHILE A STYLE IS APARTIALIZED PROJECTION OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THEREFORE IS BLINDED BY THAT CHOSENSEGMENT AND IS THEREFORE NEVER THE TOTAL—THE STYLE HAS LONG BECOME MOREIMPORTANT THAN ITS PRACTITIONERS. WORSE STILL IS THE FACT THAT THESE STYLESOFTEN ARE OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER—BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE SEPARATED IN THOUGHTSFROM EACH OTHER; CONSEQUENTLY, STYLES SEPARATE MEN RATHER THAN UNITE THEM.[../Images/124a.jpg]TRUTH CANNOT BE STRUCTURED OR CONFINED.ONE CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN A PARTIAL SET STRUCTURE ORSTYLE IS IMPOSED UPON HIM. COMBAT “AS IS” IS TOTAL, INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS” ASWELL AS ALL “THAT IS NOT,” WITHOUT FAVORITE LINES OR ANGLES, HAVING NOBOUNDARIES, ALWAYS FRESH AND ALIVE, [IT] IS NEVER SET AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING.COMBAT DEFINITELY MUST NOT BE LIMITED TO A PERSON’S PERSONAL INCLINATION, HISENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING, OR HIS PHYSICAL MAKEUP—ALTHOUGH THESE ARE PARTS OFTHE TOTALITY OF COMBAT. HOWEVER, IT IS EXACTLY THIS KIND OF “PARTICULARSECURITY” OR “CRUTCH” THAT LIMITS AND BLOCKS THE NATURAL GROWTH OF A MARTIALARTIST. IN FACT, MANY PRACTITIONERS DEVELOP SUCH A LIKING FOR THEIR “CRUTCHES”THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER WALK WITHOUT THEM. THUS ANY SPECIAL TECHNIQUE, HOWEVERCLASSICALLY CORRECT OR CLEVERLY DESIGNED, IS IN REALITY A DISEASE, SHOULD ONEBECOME OBSESSED WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY MARTIAL ARTISTS ARE OFTEN TRAPPEDIN SUCH OBSESSIONS. THESE SEEKERS ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE SEARCH FOR THAT TEACHERWHO “SATISFIES” THEIR PARTICULAR DESIRES.WHAT IS JEET KUNE DO?TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE, COMPOSITE,MODIFIED, OR OTHERWISE; THAT IS, SET WITHIN DISTINCT FORM AND LAWS AS APART FROM“THIS” STYLE. JEET KUNE DO IS NOT A FORM OF SPECIAL CONDITIONING WITH A SET OFBELIEFS AND PARTICULAR APPROACH. IT DOES NOT LOOK AT COMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLEBUT FROM ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES, AND ALTHOUGH JKD USES ALL WAYS AND MEANS TO SERVEITS END—AFTER ALL, EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THAT SCORES—IT IS BOUND BY NONE, ANDIS THEREFORE FREE FROM THEM. IN OTHER WORDS, JKD THOUGH POSSESSED OF ALL ANGLES,IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED.

LET ME THEN BEGINWITH A ZEN STORY. TO SOME READERS THIS STORY MIGHT BE A FAMILIAR ONE; HOWEVER, ICHOSE IT FOR ITS APPROPRIATENESS. NOT THAT ZEN IS SUCH A MYSTERIOUS “IN” THINGOR THAT ZEN IS ANYTHING SPECIAL.

A MARTIAL ARTIST IS FIRST AHUMAN BEING, WHICH WE ARE OURSELVES; NATIONALITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITHMARTIAL ART. TO LIVE IS A CONSTANT PROCESS OF RELATING, SO PLEASE CEASE ALL THATMENTAL CHATTERING, COME ON OUT OF THAT PROTECTIVE SHELL OF ISOLATION, THAT PROUDCONCLUSION, OR WHATEVER, AND RELATE DIRECTLY TO WHAT IS BEING SAID. CEASE ALLTHAT INTELLECTUAL OR MENTAL MUMBLE JUMBLE AND RETURN TO YOUR SENSES, AND BEAR INMIND I SEEK NEITHER YOUR APPROVAL NOR TO INFLUENCE YOU.

I AM SURE WE WILL HEAR DIFFERENT VERSIONS FROM EACHOF THEM AFTERWARDS. THE CONSEQUENCE IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE, FOR ONE CANNOT SEEA FIGHT “AS IS,” SAY FROM THE POINTS OF VIEW OF A BOXER, A WRESTLER, A KARATESTYLIST, A JUDO-KA, A KUNG FU MAN, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULARMETHOD, BECAUSE HE IS SO OFTEN BLINDED BY HIS CHOSEN SEGMENTS AND NATURALLY WILL“INTERPRET” THE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULAR CONDITIONING.THUS EVERY ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE FIGHT IS REALLY A PARTIALIZED IDEA OF THETOTALITY OF THE FIGHT, DEPENDING ON ONE’S LIKES AND DISLIKES. FIGHTING AS IS,SIMPLE AND TOTAL, IS DEFINITELY NOT DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A “CHINESE”MARTIAL ARTIST, A “KOREAN” MARTIAL ARTIST, OR “WHATEVER” KIND OF MARTIAL ARTIST.TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF SET PATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OFEXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.A STYLE IS A CLASSIFIED RESPONSE TO ONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATION.BEFORE WE LOOK INTO JKD, LET’S FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS A CLASSICAL STYLE OFMARTIAL ART. TO BEGIN WITH, WE MUST REALIZE THE ABSOLUTE FACT THAT MAN CREATEDSTYLE. DISREGARD THE MANY COLORFUL ORIGINS OF THEIR FOUNDERS—BY A WISEMYSTERIOUS HERMIT MONK, BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER IN A DREAM, IN A HOLY REVELATION,AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. A STYLE SHOULD NEVER BE THE GOSPEL TRUTH, THE LAWS ANDPRINCIPLES OF WHICH CAN NEVER BE VIOLATED. MAN, THE LIVE, CREATIVE HUMAN BEING,IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY ESTABLISHED, STERILE STYLE.LET’S SAY THE FOUNDER OF A STYLE WAS EXPOSED TO SOME PARTIAL TRUTH, AND EVEN IFIN THIS PROCESS OF DISCOVERY HE HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE THIS PARTIALTRUTH, AFTER HE DIED “HIS” POSTULATES, “HIS” INCLINATION, AND, VERY POSSIBLY,“HIS” CONCLUDING FORMULA—WE CONSTANTLY LEARN, MY FRIENDS; WE NEVER CONCLUDE—WERETURNED INTO A LAW BY HIS STUDENTS AND FOLLOWERS. CREEDS WERE INVENTED, SOLEMNREINFORCING CEREMONIES WERE PRESCRIBED, SEPARATIVE PHILOSOPHIES WERE FORMULATED,AND, FINALLY, INSTITUTIONS WERE ERECTED SO THAT WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF ASSOME SORT OF PERSONAL FLUIDITY OF ITS FOUNDER HAS NOW BECOME SOLIDIFIED, FIXEDKNOWLEDGE—AN ORGANIZED AND CLASSIFIED RESPONSE PRESENTED IN LOGICAL ORDER—APRESERVED CURE-ALL FOR MASS CONDITIONING.IN SO DOING, THE WELL-MEANING, LOYAL FOLLOWERS HAVE MADE THIS KNOWLEDGE NOT ONLYA HOLY SHRINE, BUT A TOMB IN WHICH THE FOUNDER’S WISDOM IS BURIED. OF COURSE, ASA NATURAL REACTION TO “THE OTHER TRUTH,” ANOTHER FOUNDER OR MAYBE POSSIBLY ADISSATISFIED DISCIPLE WOULD “ORGANIZE” AN OPPOSITIONAL APPROACH—AS IN THE CASEOF THE SOFT STYLE VERSUS THE HARD STYLE, THE INTERNAL SCHOOL VERSUS THE EXTERNALSCHOOL, AND SO FORTH—AND PRETTY SOON, IT TOO WOULD BECOME A LARGE ORGANIZATIONWITH ITS OWN SET LAWS AND ITS CHOSEN PATTERN. SO BEGINS THE LONG STRUGGLE WITHEACH STYLE CLAIMING TO POSSESS THE “TRUTH” TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS.STYLES ARE MERELY PARTIALIZED AND ORGANIZED PARTS OF A UNITARY WHOLE.IF WE HONESTLY LOOK AT THE REALITY OF COMBAT AS IT ACTUALLY IS, AND NOT AS WEWOULD LIKE IT TO BE, I AM SURE WE CANNOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT A STYLE TENDS TOBRING ABOUT ADJUSTMENT, PARTIALITY, DENIALS, CONDEMNATION, AND A LOT OFJUSTIFICATION. IN SHORT, THE SOLUTION BEING OFFERED IS THE VERY CAUSE OF THEPROBLEM, PLACING LIMITATIONS AND OBSTACLES ON OUR NATURAL GROWTH ANDCONSEQUENTLY OBSTRUCTING THE WAY TO GENUINE UNDERSTANDING.ONE CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN ONE IS IMPOSED BY A PARTIALSET STRUCTURE OR STYLE. COMBAT “AS IS” IS TOTAL, INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS” AS WELLAS “THAT IS NOT,” WITHOUT FAVORITE LINES OR ANGLES, HAVING NO BOUNDARIES, ALWAYSFRESH AND ALIVE, IS NEVER SET AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING.THE SAD FACT IS THAT BECAUSE STYLES TEND TO BE SEPARATED IN THOUGHT FROM EACHOTHER, AND CONSEQUENTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER, STYLES KEEP MEN APART FROM EACHOTHER RATHER THAN UNITING THEM.TRUTH CANNOT BE STRUCTURED OR CONFINED.ONE CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN ONE IS IMPOSED BY A PARTIALSET STRUCTURE OR STYLE.

COMBAT DEFINITELY MUSTNOT BE LIMITED TO YOUR PERSONAL INCLINATION, YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING, ORYOUR PHYSICAL MAKEUP—ALTHOUGH THESE ARE PARTS OF THE TOTALITY OF COMBAT.HOWEVER, IT IS EXACTLY THIS KIND OF “PARTICULAR SECURITY” OR “CRUTCH” THATLIMITS AND BLOCKS THE TOTAL NATURAL GROWTH OF A MARTIAL ARTIST. IN FACT, MANY OFTHESE PRACTITIONERS DEVELOP SUCH A LIKING FOR HIS “CRUTCHES” THAT HE CAN NOLONGER WALK WITHOUT THEM. THUS ANY SPECIAL TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER CLASSICALLYCORRECT OR CLEVERLY DESIGNED, IS IN REALITY A DISEASE, SHOULD ONE BECOMEOBSESSED WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY, MANY MARTIAL ARTIST SEEKERS, PAST OR PRESENT,ARE OFTEN TRAPPED IN SUCH OBSESSIONS. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE SEARCH FOR THATTEACHER WHO “SATISFIES” THEIR PARTICULAR DISEASES.WHAT IS JEET KUNE DO?OR MORE APPROPRIATELY, WHAT JEET KUNE DO IS NOT.

I AM SURE WE WILL HEAR DIFFERENTVERSIONS FROM EACH OF THESE STYLISTS AFTERWARDS. THE CONSEQUENCE IS QUITEUNDERSTANDABLE, FOR A PERSON CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS”—BECAUSE HE IS SO OFTENBLINDED BY HIS CHOSEN SEGMENTS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A KUNG FU STYLIST, ABOXER, A KARATE MAN, A WRESTLER, A JUDOKA, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN APARTICULAR METHOD, AND NATURALLY HE WILL INTERPRET THE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THELIMITS OF HIS PARTICULAR CONDITIONING. FIGHTING AS IS—SIMPLE AND TOTAL—ISDEFINITELY NOT DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A “CHINESE” MARTIAL ARTIST, A“KOREAN” MARTIAL ARTIST, OR “WHATEVER” TYPE OF MARTIAL ARTIST YOU ARE. TRUEOBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF FAVORITE SET PATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OFEXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.A STYLE IS A CLASSIFIED RESPONSE TO ONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATION.BEFORE WE LOOK INTO JKD, LET’S FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS A CLASSICAL STYLE ORMARTIAL ART. TO BEGIN WITH, WE MUST REALIZE THE ABSOLUTE FACT THAT MAN CREATEDSTYLES. DISREGARD THE MANY COLORFUL ORIGINS OF THEIR FOUNDERS—BY A WISE,MYSTERIOUS MONK, BY SPECIAL MESSENGER IN A DREAM, IN A HOLY REVELATION, AND SOFORTH. A STYLE SHOULD NEVER BE THE GOSPEL TRUTH, THE LAWS AND PRINCIPLES OFWHICH CAN NEVER BE VIOLATED. MAN, THE LIVE, CREATIVE HUMAN BEING, IS ALWAYS MOREIMPORTANT THAN ANY ESTABLISHED, SET STYLE.LET’S SAY A LONG TIME AGO A MARTIAL ARTIST WAS EXPOSED TO SOME PARTIAL TRUTH.EVEN IF IN HIS PROCESS OF DISCOVERY HE HAD NOT ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE THISPARTIAL TRUTH, WHICH HAS BEEN SUCH A COMMON TENDENCY IN MAN’S SEARCH FORSECURITY AND CERTAINTY IN LIFE, AFTER HE DIED, “HIS” HYPOTHESIS, “HIS” PARTIALINCLINATION, “HIS” POSTULATES, AND, MOST LIKELY, “HIS” CONCLUDING FORMULA (WECONSTANTLY LEARN, WE NEVER CONCLUDE) WOULD BE TURNED INTO A LAW BY HIS STUDENTSAND FOLLOWERS. IMPRESSIVE CREEDS WOULD BE INVENTED, SOLEMN REINFORCINGCEREMONIES PRESCRIBED, SEPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY AND PATTERNS WOULD BE FORMULATED,AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON, AND FINALLY AN INSTITUTION WOULD BE ERECTED. SO WHATMIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF AS SOME SORT OF PERSONAL FLUIDITY ON THE PART OF ITSFOUNDER HAS NOW BECOME SOLIDIFIED, FIXED KNOWLEDGE— ORGANIZED AND CLASSIFIEDRESPONSES PRESENTED IN LOGICAL ORDER—A SORT OF PRESERVED CURE-ALL FOR MASSCONDITIONING. IN SO DOING, THE WELL-MEANING, LOYAL FOLLOWERS HAVE MADE THISKNOWLEDGE NOT ONLY A HOLY SHRINE, BUT A TOMB IN WHICH THE FOUNDER’S WISDOM ISBURIED.[../Images/135a.jpg]OF COURSE, AS A NATURAL REACTION TO “THE OTHER’S TRUTH,” ANOTHER MARTIAL ARTIST,OR POSSIBLY A DISSATISFIED DISCIPLE, WOULD ORGANIZE AN OPPOSITIONAL APPROACH, ASIN THE CASE OF THE SOFT STYLE VERSUS THE HARD STYLE, THE INTERNAL SCHOOL VERSUSTHE EXTERNAL SCHOOL, AND ALL THESE SEPARATIVE NONSENSES. PRETTY SOON, THISAPPROACH, TOO, WOULD BECOME A LARGE ORGANIZATION WITH ITS OWN SET LAWS ANDCHOSEN PATTERN. SO THE LONG RIVALRY HAS BEGUN, WITH EACH STYLE CLAIMING TOPOSSESS THE TRUTH TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL THE OTHERS; WHEREAS AT BEST STYLES AREMERELY PARTS DISSECTED FROM A UNITARY WHOLE.IF WE HONESTLY LOOK AT THE REALITY OF COMBAT AS IT ACTUALLY IS, AND NOT AS WEWOULD LIKE IT TO BE, I AM SURE WE CANNOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT A STYLE TENDS TOBRING ABOUT ADJUSTMENT, PARTIALITY, DENIALS, CONDEMNATION, AND A LOT OFJUSTIFICATION. IN SHORT, THE SOLUTION BEING OFFERED IS THE VERY CAUSE OF THEPROBLEM, PLACING LIMITATION AND OBSTACLES ON OUR NATURAL GROWTH AND OBSTRUCTINGTHE WAY TO GENUINE UNDERSTANDING. BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN SEPARATED IN THOUGHTSFROM EACH OTHER AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER, STYLES KEEP MEN APARTFROM EACH OTHER RATHER THAN UNITING THEM.TRUTH CANNOT BE STRUCTURED OR CONFINED.A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN A PARTIAL SET STRUCTUREOR STYLE IS IMPOSED UPON HIM. COMBAT “AS IS” IS TOTAL, INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS”AS WELL AS ALL “THAT IS NOT,” WITHOUT FAVORITE LINES OR ANGLES, HAVING NOBOUNDARIES, ALWAYS FRESH AND ALIVE; IT IS NEVER SET AND IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING.MARTIAL ART DEFINITELY MUST NOT BE LIMITED TO YOUR PERSONAL INCLINATION, YOURENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING, OR YOUR PHYSICAL MAKEUP, ALTHOUGH THESE ARE ALSOPARTS OF THE TOTALITY OF MARTIAL ART.[../Images/137a.jpg]SHOULD THERE BE CONFINEMENT OF ANY SORT—THAT IS, SETTING COMBAT INTO A CHOSENMOLD—THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A RESISTANCE BETWEEN ONE’S SET PATTERN OF “WHAT SHOULDBE” AS OPPOSED TO THE EVER-CHANGING “WHAT IS.” IT PAYS TO REMEMBER THAT THEWHOLE IS EVIDENCED IN ALL PARTS, BUT AN ISOLATED PART, EFFICIENT OR NOT, DOESNOT CONSTITUTE THE WHOLE. SO ONE MIGHT SAY “A LITTLE LEARNING IS A DANGEROUSTHING” APPLIES APPROPRIATELY TO THOSE WHO ARE CONDITIONED TO A PARTICULARAPPROACH TO COMBAT.MAYBE BECAUSE A PERSON DOES NOT WANT TO BE LEFT UNCERTAIN OR INSECURE, HEORGANIZES A CHOICE PATTERN OF COMBAT. NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS, FOLLOWERSARE BEING ENCLOSED AND CONTROLLED WITHIN A STYLE’S LIMITATION, WHICH ISCERTAINLY LESS THAN THEIR OWN HUMAN POTENTIAL. LIKE ANYTHING ELSE, PROLONGEDIMITATIVE DRILLING WILL CERTAINLY PROMOTE MECHANICAL PRECISION AND HABITUALROUTINE SECURITY. HOWEVER, IT IS EXACTLY THIS KIND OF “PARTICULAR SECURITY” OR“CRUTCH” THAT LIMITS AND BLOCKS THE TOTAL GROWTH OF A MARTIAL ARTIST. IN FACT,QUITE A FEW PRACTITIONERS DEVELOP SUCH A LIKING FOR THEIR “CRUTCHES” THAT THEYCAN NO LONGER WALK WITHOUT THEM. THUS ANY SPECIAL TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER CLEVERLYDESIGNED, IS ACTUALLY A DISEASE, SHOULD ONE BECOME OBSESSED WITH IT.UNFORTUNATELY, MANY MARTIAL ART SEEKERS, PAST AND PRESENT, ARE OFTEN TRAPPED INSUCH OBSESSIONS. THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE SEARCH FOR THAT TEACHER WHO“SATISFIES” THEIR PARTICULAR DISEASES.[../Images/138a.jpg]WHAT JEET KUNE DO IS NOTONCE AND FOR ALL LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE—COMPOSITE,MODIFIED, OR OTHERWISE; THAT IS, A STYLE SET WITHIN DISTINCT FORM AND LAWS ASAPART FROM “THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” METHOD. ON THE CONTRARY, I HOPE TO FREE MYCOMRADES FROM CLINGING TO STYLES, PATTERNS, OR DOCTRINES.WHAT, THEN, EXACTLY IS JEET KUNE DO? LITERALLY, JEET MEANS “TO INTERCEPT, TOSTOP”; KUNE, “FIST”; DO, “THE WAY, THE ULTIMATE REALITY”— OR, “THE WAY OF THEINTERCEPTING FIST.” REMEMBER THAT THE TERM JEET KUNE DO IS MERELY A NAME USED, AMIRROR IN WHICH WE SEE OURSELVES. I AM NEITHER INTERESTED NOR CONCERNED WITH THETERM; I AM MORE INTERESTED IN ITS LIBERATING FACTOR.UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH, THERE IS NEVER A SERIES OF RULES, ACLASSIFICATION OF TECHNIQUES, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON, THAT CONSTITUTES ASO-CALLED JKD METHOD OF FIGHTING. TO BEGIN WITH, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AMETHOD OF FIGHTING. TO CREATE SUCH A METHOD IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE PUTTING A POUNDOF WATER INTO WRAPPING PAPER AND SHAPING IT, ALTHOUGH MANY FUTILE ARGUMENTSEXIST TODAY AS TO THE CHOICE OF COLORS, TEXTURES, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON, OFTHE WRAPPING PAPER.BRIEFLY, THEN, JKD IS NOT A FORM OF SPECIAL CONDITIONING WITH A SET OF BELIEFSAND PARTICULAR APPROACH. IT DOES NOT LOOK AT COMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUTFROM ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES, AND ALTHOUGH JKD UTILIZES ALL WAYS AND MEANS TO SERVEITS END (AFTER ALL, EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THAT SCORES), IT IS BOUND BY NONE ANDIS, THEREFORE, FREE FROM ALL WAYS AND MEANS. IN OTHER WORDS, JKD, THOUGHPOSSESSED OF ALL ANGLES, IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED, TO BE IN IT BUT NOT OF IT.TO DEFINE JKD AS A STYLE (GUNG FU, KARATE, KICKBOXING, BRUCE LEE’S STYLE OFSTREET FIGHTING, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON) IS TO MISS THE POINT COMPLETELY, FORITS TEACHING SIMPLY CANNOT BE REDUCED TO A SYSTEM. IF JKD IS NOT A STYLE OR AMETHOD, SOME MIGHT THINK IT IS NEUTRAL OR MAYBE IT IS INDIFFERENT. HOWEVER, THISIS NOT THE CASE EITHER, FOR JKD IS BOTH AT ONCE “THIS” AND “NOT THIS.” SONATURALLY IT IS NEITHER OPPOSED TO STYLES NOR NOT OPPOSED TO THEM. TO UNDERSTANDTHIS FULLY, ONE MUST TRANSCEND THE DUALITY OF “FOR” AND “AGAINST” AND LOOK ATONE ORGANIC WHOLE. WITHIN THE ABSOLUTE THERE IS SIMPLY NO DISTINCTION;EVERYTHING IS. A GOOD JKD MAN RESTS IN DIRECT INTUITION.OFTENTIMES, THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHETHER JKD IS AGAINST FORM. IT IS TRUE THATTHERE IS NO PREARRANGED SETS OR KATA IN THE TEACHING OF JKD. HOWEVER, WE KNOW,THROUGH INSTINCTIVE BODY FEEL, THAT IN ANY PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AND FOR EACHINDIVIDUAL THERE IS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER TO ACCOMPLISH THEPURPOSE OF THE PERFORMANCE, THAT IS, WITH REGARD TO PROPER LEVERAGE, BALANCE INMOTION, ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT USE OF MOTION AND ENERGY, AND SO FORTH, AND SOON. LIVE, EFFICIENT MOVEMENTS THAT LIBERATE ARE ONE THING. STERILE, CLASSICALSETS THAT BIND AND CONDITION ARE ANOTHER. ALSO, THERE IS A SUBTLE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN “HAVING NO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM.” THE FIRST IS IGNORANCE, THESECOND, TRANSCENDENCE.ART IS THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OF THE SELF.IF MERE MECHANICAL ROUTINE EFFICIENCY WILL MAKE EVERYONE A MARTIAL ARTIST, THENALL IS WELL. UNFORTUNATELY, COMBAT, LIKE FREEDOM, IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BEPRECONCEIVED. PREFORMATIONS SIMPLY LACK THE FLEXIBILITY AND TOTALITY TO ADAPT TOTHE EVER CHANGING.AT THIS POINT, MANY WOULD ASK, “HOW, THEN, DO WE GAIN THIS UNLIMITED FREEDOM?” ICANNOT TELL YOU BECAUSE IT WILL THEN BECOME AN APPROACH. ALTHOUGH I CAN TELL YOUWHAT IS NOT, I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS. THAT, MY FRIEND, YOU WILL HAVE TO FINDOUT ALL BY YOURSELF, FOR IT IS TIME TO AWAKEN TO A SIMPLE FACT, AND THAT IS THATTHERE IS NO HELP BUT SELF-HELP. WHAT IS MORE, WHO SAYS WE HAVE TO “GAIN”FREEDOM?BEING WISE IN TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ART SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT PROCESS OFACCUMULATING FIXED KNOWLEDGE; LIKE A FIRST DEGREE KNOWS SO MANY SETS ORTECHNIQUES, A SECOND DEGREE A LITTLE MORE; OR AN “X” BRAND MARTIAL ARTIST, AKICKER, SHOULD ACCUMULATE “Y” BRAND’S HAND TECHNIQUE, OR VICE VERSA.WE DO NOT HAVE TO “GAIN” FREEDOM BECAUSE FREEDOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US AND ISNOT SOMETHING TO BE GAINED IN THE END THROUGH STRICT AND FAITHFUL ADHERENCE TOSOME DEFINITE FORMULAS. FORMULAS CAN ONLY INHIBIT FREEDOM AND PREFORMATIONS ONLYSQUELCH CREATIVITY AND IMPOSE MEDIOCRITY. SO-CALLED SPIRITUAL TRAINING PROMOTESNOT THE PROMISED INTERNAL POWER BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTIPATION. BEAR IN MINDTHAT FREEDOM IS NOT AN IDEAL, AN END TO BE DESIRED. WE DO NOT “BECOME”; WESIMPLY “ARE.” THE TRAINING IN MARTIAL ART IS TOWARD THIS: “BEING” MIND, RATHERTHAN “HAVING” MIND, LIBERATING THE SPIRIT RATHER THAN BINDING THE BODY.LEARNING IS DEFINITELY NOT MERE IMITATION OR THE ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE ANDCONFORM TO FIXED KNOWLEDGE. LEARNING IS A CONSTANT PROCESS OF DISCOVERY ANDNEVER A CONCLUDING ONE. IN JKD WE BEGIN NOT BY ACCUMULATION BUT BY DISCOVERINGTHE CAUSE OF OUR IGNORANCE, AND OFTENTIMES THIS INVOLVES A SHEDDING PROCESS.PATTERNS, TECHNIQUES, DOCTRINES, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON, TOUCH ONLY THE FRINGEOF GENUINE UNDERSTANDING. ITS CORE, HOWEVER, LIES IN THE INDIVIDUAL MIND, ANDUNTIL THAT IS TOUCHED, EVERYTHING IS STILL UNCERTAIN AND ONLY SUPERFICIAL. TRUTHWILL NOT COME UNTIL WE HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND PERSONALLY THE WHOLE PROCESS OFTHE WORKING OF OUR BEING. AFTER ALL, ULTIMATELY, KNOWLEDGE IN MARTIAL ART SIMPLYMEANS SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AND JKD CAN BECOME INTELLIGIBLE ONLY IN THE VIGOROUS ANDCONSTANT PROCESS OF SELF-INQUIRY AND SELF-DISCOVERY.UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN MARTIAL ART ARE CONFORMERS. THE STUDENTSELDOM LEARNS TO DEPEND UPON HIMSELF FOR EXPRESSION. INSTEAD, HE FAITHFULLY ORBLINDLY FOLLOWS AN INSTRUCTOR, THE AUTHORITY FIGURE, AND HIS INSTRUCTOR’SIMPOSED PATTERN. THAT WAY, THE STUDENT FEELS HE IS NO LONGER ALONE AND FINDSSECURITY IN MASS IMITATION. HOWEVER, WHAT IS NURTURED IS THE DEPENDENT MINDRATHER THAN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY, WHICH IS SO ESSENTIAL TO GENUINE UNDERSTANDING.SO THROUGH DAILY CONDITIONING A STUDENT WILL PROBABLY BE SKILLFUL ACCORDING TO APATTERN; HOWEVER, HE WILL NOT COME TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF.MOST MARTIAL ART TEACHERS ARE FIXED IN A ROUTINE. BECAUSE THEY DEPEND ON AMETHOD AND MERELY DRILL SYSTEMATIC ROUTINES, THEY CAN ONLY PRODUCE PATTERNIZEDPRISONERS ACCORDING TO A LIFELESS, SYSTEMATIZING CONCEPT. A TEACHER, A REALLYGOOD TEACHER, IS NEVER A GIVER OF TRUTH; HE IS A GUIDE, A POINTER TO TRUTH.THEREFORE, A GOOD TEACHER, OR, MORE APPROPRIATELY, A GUIDE, STUDIES EACH STUDENTINDIVIDUALLY AND HELPS TO AWAKEN THE STUDENT TO EXPLORE HIMSELF, BOTH INTERNALLYAND EXTERNALLY, AND ULTIMATELY TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH HIS BEING. FOR EXAMPLE,TO ASSIST HIS STUDENT’S GROWTH, A TEACHER MIGHT CONFRONT THE STUDENT WITHSKILLFUL FRUSTRATIONS. ALL IN ALL, A TEACHER ACTS AS A CATALYST, AND NOT ONLYMUST HE HAVE A TREMENDOUS UNDERSTANDING; HE MUST ALSO POSSESS A SENSITIVE MINDWITH GREAT FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY.TO CHANGE WITH CHANGE IS THE CHANGELESS STATE.HOW OFTEN WE ARE TOLD BY DIFFERENT “PROFESSORS” AND “MASTERS”—AND WE DO HAVEMANY PHILOSOPHERS AND DESK RESEARCHERS AROUND—THAT MARTIAL ART IS LIFE ITSELF? IWONDER HOW MANY OF THEM REALLY UNDERSTAND. TO BE SURE, LIFE DOES NOT MEANSTAGNATION, A PARTIALIZED SOMETHING OR A CONFINING FRAME. LIFE IS A CONSTANTMOVEMENT, RHYTHMIC AS WELL AS UN-RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT. ALSO LIFE IS A CONSTANTCHANGING PROCESS.INSTEAD OF FLOWING WITH THIS PROCESS OF CHANGE CHOICELESSLY, MANY OF THE MARTIALART “MASTERS,” PAST AND PRESENT, HAVE BUILT AN ILLUSION OF FIXED FORMS,SOLIDIFYING THE EVER FLOWING, DISSECTING THE TOTALITY, ORGANIZING CHOSENPATTERN, PLANNING SPONTANEITY, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. LOOK AROUND AND YOU WILLFIND IN MARTIAL ART NOW WE HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF ROUTINE PERFORMERS, TRICKARTISTS, INSENSITIZED PATTERNIZED ROBOTS, GLORIFIERS OF THE PAST—ALL ORGANIZERSOF DESPAIR.THE PITIFUL SIGHT IS TO SEE THE SINCERE STUDENTS EARNESTLY REPEATING THOSEIMITATIVE DRILLS, LISTENING TO THEIR OWN SCREAMS AND SPIRITUAL YELLS. IN MOSTCASES, THE MEANS BEING OFFERED ARE SO ELABORATE THAT TREMENDOUS ATTENTION MUSTBE GIVEN TO THEM, AND GRADUALLY THE END IS FORGOTTEN. SO WHAT THESE STUDENTS AREDOING IS MERELY PERFORMING THEIR METHODICAL ROUTINES AS RESPONSE RATHER THANRESPONDING TO “WHAT IS.” THEY NO LONGER “LISTEN” TO CIRCUMSTANCES; THEY “RECITE”THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE POOR SOULS HAVE UNKNOWINGLY BECOME A CLASSICAL MESS.THEY ARE THE “PRODUCT” OF CONDITIONING THAT WAS PRESCRIBED FOR THEM HUNDREDS ANDTHOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.A FINGER POINTING TO THE MOONTHERE IS NO STANDARD IN TOTAL COMBAT, AND EXPRESSION MUST BE FREE. THATLIBERATING TRUTH IS A REALITY ONLY INSOFAR AS IT IS EXPERIENCED AND LIVED IN ITSSUCHNESS BY THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF, AND THIS TRUTH IS FAR BEYOND ANY STYLES ORDISCIPLINES. REMEMBER, TOO, THAT JKD IS JUST A TERM USED, A BOAT TO GET ONEACROSS, AND ONCE ACROSS IT IS TO BE DISCARDED AND NOT CARRIED ON ONE’S BACK.THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS AT BEST ARE MERELY “A FINGER POINTING TO THE MOON.” PLEASEDO NOT TAKE THE FINGER TO BE THE MOON OR FIX YOUR INTENSE GAZE ON THE FINGER ANDTHUS MISS THE BEAUTIFUL SIGHT OF HEAVEN. AFTER ALL, THE USEFULNESS OF THE FINGERIS IN POINTING AWAY FROM ITSELF TO THE LIGHT THAT ILLUMINES FINGER AND ALL.[../Images/142a.jpg]SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ENTITLED “JEET KUNE DO:WHAT IT IS NOT,”CIRCA 1971.

A MARTIAL ARTISTIS FIRST A MAN, WHICH WE ARE OURSELVES; NATIONALITIES HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITHMARTIAL ART. I AM ASKING YOU NOT TO ACCEPT NOR TO DENY WHAT IS SAID; ALL I ASKIS THAT YOU SUSPEND JUDGMENT AND LISTEN CHOICELESSLY.SUPPOSING SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ARE TRAINED IN DIFFERENT COMBATIVE ARTS HAVE JUSTWITNESSED A FIGHT. I AM SURE WE WILL HEAR DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF IT AFTERWARDS.THE CONSEQUENCE IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE, FOR ONE CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS”BECAUSE HE WILL SEE THE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULARCONDITIONING— SAY FROM THE POINT OF VIEWS OF A BOXER, A WRESTLER, A KARATEKA, AJUDOKA, A GUNG FU MAN, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD. EVERYATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE FIGHT IS REALLY AN INTELLECTUAL AND EMOTIONAL REACTION,A PARTIAL IDEA OF THE TOTAL FIGHT; IN THIS CASE, THE REACTION DEPENDS ON ONE’SLIKES AND DISLIKES. FIGHTING IS NOT SOMETHING DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS AKOREAN MARTIAL ARTIST, A CHINESE MARTIAL ARTIST, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. TRUEOBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF FAVORITE SET PATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OFEXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.STYLEJUST WHAT IS A CLASSICAL STYLE OF MARTIAL ART? FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE MUSTREALIZE THE FACT THAT MAN CREATED STYLES. DISREGARD THE MANY FANCY HISTORICALORIGINS OF THEIR FOUNDERS—BY A WISE ANCIENT MONK, BY SPECIAL MESSENGER IN ADREAM, IN A HOLY REVELATION, AND SO FORTH—A STYLE SHOULD NEVER BE THE GOSPELTRUTH, THE LAWS AND PRINCIPLES OF WHICH CAN NEVER BE VIOLATED. MAN, THE HUMANBEING, IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY STYLE.THE FOUNDER OF A STYLE MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO SOME PARTIAL TRUTH, BUT AS TIMEPASSED BY, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE FOUNDER PASSED AWAY, THIS PARTIAL TRUTH BECAME ALAW, OR WORSE STILL, A PREJUDICED FAITH AGAINST THE “DIFFERENT” STYLES. IN ORDERTO PASS ALONG THIS KNOWLEDGE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION, THE VARIOUSRESPONSES HAD TO BE ORGANIZED AND CLASSIFIED, AND PRESENT IN LOGICAL ORDER.CREEDS WERE INVENTED, REINFORCING CEREMONIES WERE SET TO GLORIFY, SEPARATIVEPHILOSOPHIES ESTABLISHED AND ORGANIZATIONS ERECTED. SO A DEFINITE FORM RESULTEDAND ALL THOSE WHO COME TO LEARN WILL BE BOUND BY THAT FORM.SO WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF AS SOME SORT OF PERSONAL FLUIDITY ON THE PART OFITS FOUNDER IS NOW SOLIDIFIED KNOWLEDGE, A SORT OF PRESERVED CURE-ALL FOR MASSCONDITIONING. IN THE PROCESS THE FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS HAVE MADE THIS KNOWLEDGE NOTONLY A HOLY SHRINE, BUT A TOMB IN WHICH THE FOUNDER’S WISDOM IS BURIED. BECAUSEOF THE NATURE OF ORGANIZATION AND PRESERVATION, THE MEANS BECOME SO ELABORATEDTHAT TREMENDOUS ATTENTION MUST BE DEVOTED TO THEM, AND GRADUALLY THE END ISFORGOTTEN.IF WE HONESTLY LOOK AT REALITY AS IT IS, AND NOT AS WE WOULD LIKE [IT] TO BE, IAM SURE WE CANNOT HELP BUT NOTICE THAT A STYLE TENDS TO BRING ABOUT PARTIALITY,ADJUSTMENTS, INTERPRETATION, JUSTIFICATION, CONDEMNATION, DENIALS, AND SO ON; INSHORT, THE SOLUTION BEING OFFERED IS THE VERY CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, PLACINGOBSTACLES AND LIMITATIONS IN THE LIGHT THAT WILL ILLUMINE OUR SHADOWS [ANDIMPEDING OUR] WAY TO UNDERSTANDING. IF WE REALLY AND TOTALLY SEE ORGANICALLY,THEN WE FIND THAT THE END IS ALSO IN THE MEANS, THE ANSWER IS IN THE QUESTION,EACH BEING THE CAUSE AS WELL AS THE RESULT OF EACH OTHER.AT ANY RATE, THE FOLLOWERS OF A COMBAT STYLE OFTEN ACCEPT ITS “ORGANIZEDSEGMENT” AS THE TOTAL REALITY OF COMBAT. OF COURSE, AS A DIRECT REACTION TO “THEOTHER TRUTH,” ANOTHER FOUNDER OR MAYBE A DISSATISFIED DISCIPLE MIGHT “ORGANIZE”AN OPPOSITIONAL APPROACH, AND PRETTY SOON IT, TOO, WOULD BECOME A LARGEORGANIZATION WITH ITS OWN LAWS AND FIXED FRAGMENTARY PATTERNS. THESE STYLESARISE FROM THE DIVISION OF A UNITARY TOTAL, AND NOT ONLY DO THEY TEND TO BESEPARATED IN THOUGHTS FROM EACH OTHER, AND CONSEQUENTLY OPPOSING EACH OTHER—THUS KEEPING PEOPLE APART—BUT EACH STYLE ALSO CLAIMS TO POSSES “TRUTH” TO THEEXCLUSION OF ALL THE OTHERS. SO WHEREAS THE INDIVIDUAL IS TOTAL ANDUNIVERSAL—WHILE A PARTICULAR STYLE IS PARTIALIZED, BLINDED BY THAT CHOSENSEGMENT AND THEREFORE IS NEVER THE TOTAL—THE STYLE HAS LONG BECOME MOREIMPORTANT THAN ITS PRACTITIONERS.[../Images/146a.jpg]STYLE: “IT IS A CLASSIFIED RESPONSE TO ONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATION.”A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN A PARTIAL SET STRUCTUREOR STYLE IS IMPOSED UPON HIM. COMBAT “AS IS” IS TOTAL (INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS”AS WELL AS ALL “THAT IS NOT”), WITHOUT FAVORITE LINES OR ANGLES, HAVING NOBOUNDARIES AND ALWAYS FRESH AND ALIVE; IS NEVER SET AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING.COMBAT DEFINITELY MUST NOT BE LIMITED TO YOUR PERSONAL INCLINATION, YOURPHYSICAL MAKEUP, OR YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING—ALTHOUGH THESE ARE ALSOPARTS OF THE TOTAL COMBAT. SHOULD THERE BE ANY CONFINEMENT OF ANY SORT, THAT IS,SETTING COMBAT INTO A CHOICE MOLD; THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A RESISTANCE OF YOUR SETPATTERN OF “WHAT SHOULD BE” AS OPPOSED TO THE EVER-CHANGING “WHAT IS.”REMEMBER THAT THE WHOLE IS EVIDENCED IN ALL THE PARTS, BUT AN ISOLATED PART,EFFICIENT OR NOT, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE WHOLE. IN THE FIELD OF LAW, THERE ARECRIMINAL LAWYERS, BUSINESS LAWYERS, AND SO FORTH; UNFORTUNATELY, NO SUCH THINGOCCURS IN “ALL-IN/TOTAL FIGHTING.” FAVORITE SEGMENTS DO NOT FARE TOO WELL IN“ALL-IN/TOTAL FIGHTING.” SO ONE CAN SAY “A LITTLE LEARNING IS A DANGEROUS THING”APPLIES APPROPRIATELY TO THOSE WHO ARE CONDITIONED TO A PARTICULAR APPROACH TOCOMBAT.ONCE WE SEE THAT A STYLE HAS THE TENDENCY TO “SET” AND “TRAP” REALITY INTO ACHOSEN MOLD, WE WILL THEN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROFESSED CURE IS ITSELF ADISEASE. MAYBE BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT UNCERTAIN OR INSECURE, THEY“ORGANIZE” A CHOICE PATTERN OF COMBAT. DISREGARD THE CAUSE, ITS FOLLOWERS AREBEING “ENCLOSED” AND “CONTROLLED” WITHIN THE STYLE’S LIMITATION, WHICH ISCERTAINLY LESS THAN THEIR OWN POTENTIAL. LIKE ANYTHING ELSE, PROLONGED IMITATIVEDRILLING WILL CERTAINLY PROMOTE MECHANICAL PRECISION AND A HABITUAL PATTERN OFSECURITY; HOWEVER, IT IS THIS KIND OF “PARTICULAR SECURITY” OR “CRUTCH” THATLIMITS AND BLOCKS THE NATURAL GROWTH AND HINDERS A MARTIAL ARTIST IN HIS JOURNEYTO HIS REUNION WITH HIS TOTAL BEING. MANY MARTIAL ARTISTS DEVELOP SUCH A LIKINGFOR THEIR “CRUTCHES” THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER WALK WITHOUT THEM. THUS ANY SPECIALTECHNIQUE, HOWEVER CLASSICALLY CORRECT OR CLEVERLY DESIGNED, IS A DISEASE,SHOULD ONE BECOME OBSESSED WITH IT. MANY MARTIAL ARTISTS, RANKED OR UN-RANKED,ARE OFTEN TRAPPED IN SUCH OBSESSIONS. THESE MARTIAL ARTISTS, NOT UNLIKE MOST OFTHE MARTIAL ART SEEKERS, ARE CONSTANTLY ON THE SEARCH FOR THAT TEACHER WHO“SATISFIES” THEIR PARTICULAR DISEASES.WHAT IS JKD?TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE, COMPOSITE, MODIFIEDOR OTHERWISE, THAT IS, A STYLE OR METHOD SET WITHIN DISTINCT FORM AND LAWS ASAPART FROM “THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” METHOD. ON THE CONTRARY, I HOPE TO FREE MYFOLLOWERS FROM CLINGING TO STYLES, PATTERNS, OR MOLDS. MORE ABOUT THIS LATER,BUT IN THE MEANTIME, DO REMEMBER THAT THE TERM JEET KUNE DO IS MERELY A NAMEUSED, A MIRROR IN WHICH WE SEE OURSELVES. THE BRAND NAME IS REALLY NOTHINGSPECIAL.UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH, THERE IS NOT A SERIES OF RULES, ACLASSIFICATION OF TECHNIQUES, AND SO FORTH, THAT CONSTITUTE A SO-CALLED JKDMETHOD OF FIGHTING. TO BEGIN WITH, LET ME BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT THERE ISNO SUCH THING AS A METHOD OF FIGHTING. TO CREATE SUCH A METHOD IS PRETTY MUCHLIKE PUTTING A POUND OF WATER INTO WRAPPING PAPER AND SHAPING IT—ALTHOUGH [MANY]FUTILE ARGUMENTS EXIST NOWADAYS AS TO THE CHOICE OF COLORS, TEXTURES, AND SOFORTH, OF THE WRAPPING PAPER.BRIEFLY, JKD IS NOT A FORM OF SPECIALIZED CONDITIONING WITH A SET OF BELIEFS ANDA PARTICULAR APPROACH. SO BASICALLY IT IS NOT A “MASS” ART. STRUCTURALLY, ITDOES NOT LOOK AT COMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUT FROM ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES,BECAUSE IT IS NOT BOUND TO ANY SYSTEM. AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ITS TECHNIQUES CANNOTBE REDUCED TO A SYSTEM. AND ALTHOUGH IT UTILIZES ALL WAYS AND MEANS TO SERVE ITSEND (EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THAT SCORES), IT IS BOUND BY NONE, AND IT ISTHEREFORE FREE FROM ALL WAYS AND MEANS. IN OTHER WORDS, JKD, ALTHOUGH POSSESSEDOF ALL ANGLES, IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED; FOR AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, ANYSTRUCTURE, HOWEVER EFFICIENTLY DESIGNED, BECOMES A CAGE IF THE PRACTITIONER ISOBSESSED WITH IT. TO DEFINE JKD AS A STYLE (GUNG FU, KARATE, KICKBOXING, AND SOFORTH) IS TO MISS THE POINT COMPLETELY, FOR ITS TEACHING CANNOT BE REDUCED TO ASYSTEM. IF JKD IS NOT A STYLE OR A METHOD, MAYBE IT IS NEUTRAL OR MAYBE IT ISINDIFFERENT. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE EITHER, FOR JKD IS BOTH AT ONCE“THIS” AND “NOT THIS,” AND JKD IS NEITHER OPPOSED TO STYLES NOR NOT OPPOSED TOTHEM. TO UNDERSTAND FULLY, ONE MUST TRANSCEND THE DUALITY OF “FOR” AND “AGAINST”AND LOOK AT ONE ORGANIC WHOLE. WITHIN THE TOTALITY THERE IS SIMPLY NODISTINCTION; EVERYTHING IS. A GOOD JKD ARTIST RESTS IN DIRECT INTUITION.“HAVING NO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM”OFTENTIMES THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHETHER JKD IS AGAINST FORM. IT IS TRUE THATTHERE ARE NO PREARRANGED SETS OR KATA IN THE TEACHING OF JKD; HOWEVER, WE KNOW,THROUGH BODY-FEEL, THAT IN ANY PHYSICAL MOVEMENT THERE IS ALWAYS A MOSTEFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL TO ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE OF THEPERFORMANCE— THAT IS, WITH REGARD TO PROPER LEVERAGE, BALANCE IN MOTION,ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT USE OF MOTIONS AND ENERGY, AND SO ON. LIVE, EFFICIENTMOVEMENT THAT LIBERATES IS ONE THING; STERILE, CLASSICAL SETS THAT BIND ANDCONDITION ARE ANOTHER. ALSO, THERE IS A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “HAVING NOFORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM”; THE FIRST IS IGNORANCE, THE SECOND, TRANSCENDENCE.IF MERE MECHANICAL ROUTINE EFFICIENCY WILL MAKE EVERYONE A MARTIAL ARTIST, THENALL IS WELL; UNFORTUNATELY, COMBAT, LIKE FREEDOM, IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BEPRECONCEIVED. PREFORMATIONS SIMPLY LACK THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO THE EVERCHANGING. AT THIS POINT, MANY WOULD ASK HOW, THEN, DO WE GAIN THIS UNLIMITEDFREEDOM? I CANNOT TELL YOU BECAUSE IT WILL THEN BECOME AN APPROACH. ALTHOUGH ICAN TELL YOU WHAT IS NOT, I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IS. “THAT,” MY FRIEND, YOU WILLHAVE TO FIND OUT ALL BY YOURSELF, FOR IT IS TIME TO AWAKEN TO A SIMPLE TRUTH,AND THAT IS: THERE IS NO HELP BUT SELF-HELP. WHAT IS MORE, WHO SAYS WE HAVE TO“GAIN” FREEDOM?[../Images/149a.jpg]IN TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ART BEING WISE SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT PROCESS OFACCUMULATING OF FIXED KNOWLEDGE—LIKE A FIRST DEGREE KNOWS SO MANY SETS ORTECHNIQUES, A SECOND DEGREE A LITTLE MORE; OR AN X BRAND MARTIAL ARTIST, AKICKER, SHOULD ACCUMULATE Y BRAND’S HAND TECHNIQUES, OR VICE VERSA. ACCUMULATINGFIXED KNOWLEDGE OF ONESELF EXTERNALLY IS NOT THE PROCESS OF JKD; RATHER, JKD ISA PROCESS OF DISCOVERING THE CAUSE OF ONE’S IGNORANCE, AND OFTENTIMES INVOLVES ASHEDDING PROCESS. ACCUMULATING FIXED KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT NECESSARILY BRING ABOUTTRUTH. TRUTH COMES TO US WHEN WE UNDERSTAND PERSONALLY THE WHOLE PROCESS OFWORKING ON OUR BEING. NO AMOUNT OF FIXED KNOWLEDGE OR “SECRET TEACHING” CAN BECOMPARED TO CLARITY OF UNDERSTANDING. PATTERNS, DOCTRINES, AND SO FORTH, TOUCHONLY THE FRINGE OF MARTIAL ART. ITS CORE LIES IN THE HUMAN MIND, AND, UNTIL THATIS TOUCHED, EVERYTHING IS STILL SUPERFICIAL AND UNCERTAIN.REMEMBER, MY COMRADES, THAT ULTIMATELY, KNOWLEDGE IN MARTIAL ART SIMPLY MEANSSELF-KNOWLEDGE, AND JKD CAN BECOME INTELLIGIBLE ONLY IN THE VIGOROUS ANDCONSTANT PROCESS OF SELF-DISCOVERY. PREVIOUSLY I HAVE SAID THAT WE DO NOT HAVETO “GAIN” FREEDOM BECAUSE FREEDOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US, AND IT [IS] NOTSOMETHING TO BE GAINED AT THE END THROUGH STRICT ADHERENCE TO SOME PARTICULARFORMULAS. FREEDOM IS NOT AN IDEAL, AN END TO BE DESIRED. WE DO NOT “BECOME,” WESIMPLY “ARE.” THEREFORE, TRAINING IN JKD IS TOWARD THIS: “BEING” MIND, RATHERTHAN “HAVING” MIND. ONCE AND FOR ALL, DO COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT STERILEPATTERNS ARE INCAPABLE OF SUCH LIVELINESS AND FRESHNESS, AND PREFORMATIONS ONLYSQUELCH CREATIVITY AND IMPOSE MEDIOCRITY. ALSO, THE MYSTICAL MIND TRAININGPROMOTES NOT THE PROMISED INTERNAL POWER, BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTIPATION. INJKD, WHETHER IT IS INWARD OR OUTWARD TRAINING, THE TECHNIQUES USED AREOFTENTIMES TEMPORARY EXPEDIENTS, THE AIMS OF WHICH ARE TO LIBERATE THE SPIRITRATHER THAN TO BIND THE BODY.WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS TEACHING MY OWN VERSION OF THEWING CHUN STYLE—I HAD MY “CHINESE” SYSTEM THEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THEN I AM NOLONGER INTERESTED IN SYSTEMS OR ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZED INSTITUTES TEND TOPRODUCE PATTERNIZED PRISONERS OF A SYSTEMATIZED CONCEPT, AND THE INSTRUCTORS AREOFTEN FIXED IN A ROUTINE. OF COURSE, WHAT IS WORSE IS THAT, BY IMPOSING ALIFELESS PREFORMATION, THEIR NATURAL GROWTH IS BLOCKED.A TEACHER, A REALLY GOOD TEACHER, FUNCTIONS AS A POINTER TO TRUTH, BUT NOT AGIVER OF TRUTH. HE EMPLOYS A MINIMUM OF FORM TO LEAD HIS STUDENT TO THEFORMLESS. FURTHERMORE, HE POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO ENTER AMOLD BUT NOT BEING CAGED IN IT, OR TO FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES WITHOUT BEING BOUNDBY THEM. FOR A PLIABLE, CHOICELESS OBSERVATION WITHOUT EXCLUSION IS SO ESSENTIALIN THE CULTIVATION OF MARTIAL ART—AN “ALTOGETHER ALERT AWARENESS” WITHOUT ITSCENTER OR ITS CIRCUMFERENCE, TO BE IN IT, BUT NOT OF IT. ABOVE ALL, A TEACHERSHOULD NOT DEPEND ON A METHOD AND DRILL SYSTEMATIC ROUTINES; INSTEAD, HE STUDIESEACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND AWAKENS HIM TO EXPLORE HIMSELF, BOTH INTERNALLY ANDEXTERNALLY, AND ULTIMATELY TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH HIS BEING. SUCH TEACHING,WHICH IS REALLY NO TEACHING, REQUIRES A SENSITIVE MIND WITH GREAT FLEXIBILITYAND ADAPTABILITY, AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY NOWADAYS.SINCERE AND SERIOUS LEARNERS ARE EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO COME BY, TOO. MANYSTUDENTS ARE FIVE-MINUTE ENTHUSIASTS; SOME OF THEM COME IN WITH SELFISH MOTIVES,BUT UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THEM ARE SECONDHAND ARTISTS, BASICALLY CONFORMERS. ANAVERAGE PRACTITIONER IN THE MARTIAL ART SELDOM LEARNS TO EXPRESS HIMSELF;INSTEAD, HE FAITHFULLY FOLLOWS AN INSTRUCTOR, THE AUTHORITY FIGURE, AND ANIMPOSED PATTERN. I GUESS A PERSON FINDS MORE SECURITY IN MASS IMITATION;UNFORTUNATELY WHAT IS NURTURED IS THE DEPENDING MIND RATHER THAN INDEPENDENTINQUIRY. THESE TRADITION-BOUND TEACHERS REINFORCE THE CONDITIONING THROUGH THEIRDAILY TEACHING AND WILL NOT TRY TO UNDERSTAND REALITY AS IT IS BECAUSE ITCONDEMNS THEM. AS TIME GOES BY THEIR PRACTITIONERS MIGHT UNDERSTAND SOMEROUTINES AND MIGHT EVEN BECOME SKILLFUL ACCORDING TO A PARTICULAR PATTERN.HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT COME TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVEGAINED CONTROL OF THE MANIPULATIVE ROUTINE SKILL THEY HAVE, BUT NOT WHAT THEYARE IN THEMSELVES.AS HE MATURES, A MARTIAL ARTIST WILL REALIZE THAT HIS KICK OR PUNCH IS REALLYNOT SO MUCH A TOOL FOR CONQUERING HIS OPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGHHIS CONSCIOUSNESS, HIS EGO, HIS FEAR, AND ALL HIS MENTAL BLOCKS.MARTIAL ART IS NOT MERELY THE PHYSICAL ACT OF FILLING TIME AND SPACE THROUGHSOME SORT OF PRECISION-LIKE MOVEMENT. MACHINES CAN DO THAT, TOO. AS HE MATURES,A MARTIAL ARTIST WILL REALIZE THAT HIS KICK OR PUNCH IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH ATOOL FOR CONQUERING HIS OPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGH HISCONSCIOUSNESS, HIS EGO, HIS FEAR, AND ALL HIS MENTAL BLOCKS. INDEED, THE KICKSAND PUNCHES ARE ULTIMATELY MEANS FOR PENETRATING THE DEPTH OF HIS BEING SO THATHE CAN RESTORE THE EQUILIBRIUM OF HIS INNER CENTER OF GRAVITY AND ACHIEVEHARMONY. WITH THIS VITAL INWARD LOOSENING FLOWS HIS OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF HISTOOLS. BEHIND EACH MOVEMENT OF AN ACCOMPLISHED MARTIAL ARTIST IS THIS WHOLENESSOF BEING, THIS ALL-INCLUSIVE ATTITUDE.HOW OFTEN WE ARE TOLD BY DIFFERENT “MASTERS” AND “PROFESSORS”—AND WE DO HAVEMANY ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHERS AND DESK RESEARCHERS AROUND—THAT MARTIAL ART IS LIFEITSELF; HOWEVER, I WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM REALLY APPRECIATE THAT STATEMENT ANDTRULY UNDERSTAND. TO BE SURE, LIFE IS NOT A PARTIALIZED SOMETHING, A FRAME. LIFEIS NEVER STAGNATION. IT IS A CONSTANT MOVEMENT, UNRHYTHMIC MOVEMENT, AS WELL ASCONSTANT CHANGE. INSTEAD OF FLOWING WITH THIS CHANGE CHOICELESSLY, MANY OF THEMARTIAL ART “MASTERS,” PAST AND PRESENT, HAVE BUILT AN ILLUSION OF FIXED FORMS,SOLIDIFYING THE EVER FLOWING, DISSECTING THE TOTALITY, ORGANIZING CHOSENPATTERNS, PLANNING SPONTANEITY, SEPARATING THE HARMONIOUS UNITY INTO THE DUALITYOF THE SOFT VERSUS THE FIRM, INDULGING IN CREATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE“GOOD OLD TIMES,” AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON.THE RESULT IS QUITE EVIDENT. IN MARTIAL ART WE HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF ROUTINEPERFORMERS, TRICK ARTISTS, CREAM PUFFS, ORGANIZED DESPAIR, AND MANY MANYINSENSITIZED PATTERNIZED ROBOTS AROUND LISTENING TO THEIR OWN SCREAMS ANDSPIRITUAL YELLS. THEY ARE MERELY PERFORMING THEIR METHODICAL ROUTINES ASRESPONSES RATHER THAN RESPONDING TO “WHAT IS.” THEY NO LONGER “LISTEN” TOCIRCUMSTANCES; THEY “RECITE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES.” THESE POOR SOULS HAVE BECOMETHOSE ORGANIZED FORMS; THEY ARE THOSE CLASSICAL BLOCKS. IN SHORT, THEY ARE THE“PRODUCT” OF CONDITIONING THAT HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN FOR HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDSOF YEARS.THERE IS NO STANDARD IN TOTAL COMBAT, AND EXPRESSION MUST BE FREE. THATLIBERATING TRUTH IS A REALITY ONLY INSOFAR AS IT IS EXPERIENCED AND LIVED IN ITSSUCHNESS BY THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF, AND THIS TRUTH IS FAR BEYOND ANY STYLES ORDISCIPLINES. REMEMBER, TOO, THAT JKD IS JUST A NAME USED, A BOAT TO GET ONEACROSS, AND ONCE ACROSS [IT] IS TO BE DISCARDED, AND NOT TO BE CARRIED ON ONE’SBACK.THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS AT BEST ARE MERELY “A FINGER POINTING TO THE MOON.” PLEASEDO NOT TAKE THE FINGER TO BE THE MOON AND FIX YOUR INTENSE GAZE ON THE FINGERAND THUS MISS ALL THE SPLENDOR OF HEAVEN. AFTER ALL, THE USEFULNESS OF THEFINGER IS IN “POINTING AWAY FROM ITSELF TO THE LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINES FINGER ANDALL.”5-FTOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION (JEET KUNE DO: V)ONE CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS,” SAY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BOXER, AWRESTLER, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD, BECAUSE HE WILL SEETHE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULAR CONDITIONING. REMEMBER,EVERY SPORT OR ART—THIS INCLUDES JUDO, KARATE, AND KUNG FU—EVERY ATTEMPT TODESCRIBE THE FIGHT IS REALLY “ONE’S” VERSION OF IT, A PERSONAL MENTAL REPLICA ORA PARTIAL IDEA OF THE TOTAL FIGHT, DEPENDING ON HIS LIKES OR DISLIKES.[../Images/153a.jpg]FIGHTING IS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A KOREANMARTIAL ARTIST, A JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTIST, A CHINESE MARTIAL ARTIST, AND SOFORTH. WHILE THE WRESTLER … COULD HAVE EITHER KICKED OR PUNCHED AS A MEANS TOBRIDGE THE GAP FOR HIS SPECIALTY, TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OFSET PATTERN, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEM.SIMILARLY, A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY—THE IMPORTANT WORD HERE ISFULLY—WHEN A PARTIAL SET STRUCTURE OR STYLE IS IMPOSED ON HIM. COMBAT “AS IS” ISTOTAL (INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS” AS WELL AS “THAT IS NOT”), WITHOUT LIMITINGBOUNDARIES OR FAVORITE LINES, ALWAYS ALIVE, NEVER SET AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING.IT IS NOT TO BE LIMITED BY YOUR INCLINATION, YOUR PHYSICAL MAKEUP, OR YOURENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING, ALTHOUGH THESE ARE ALSO PARTS OF THE TOTAL COMBAT.IF A PERSON CONFINES COMBAT TO A PARTICULAR PATTERN, HE CAN NEVER EXPRESSHIMSELF FREELY. FOR HOW CAN HE EXPRESS HIMSELF FREELY WHEN THERE IS A SCREEN OFHIS SET PATTERN OF WHAT “SHOULD BE” AS OPPOSED TO THE EVER-CHANGING “WHAT IS”?BECAUSE HE DOES NOT WANT TO BE LEFT UNCERTAIN OR INSECURE, HE “ORGANIZES” ACHOICE PATTERN OF COMBAT, A DRILL-LIKE PRECISION OF MOVEMENTS, A PLANNEDSPONTANEITY, AND SO FORTH. FROM IMITATIVE DRILLING ON SUCH ORGANIZED “LANDSWIMMING PATTERNS” THE PRACTITIONER’S MARGIN OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION GROWSNARROWER AND NARROWER. AFTER ALL, THE WRONG MEANS WILL LEAD TO THE WRONG END.CONSEQUENTLY, IT WON’T BE LONG BEFORE THE WILL BECOMES PARALYZED WITHIN THEFRAMEWORK OF SUCH A STERILE PATTERN, ULTIMATELY ACCEPTING THE LIMITED PATTERN ASTOTAL REALITY.MANY OF OUR MARTIAL ARTISTS NOWADAYS ARE MERELY PERFORMING THEIR METHODICALROUTINES AS A RESPONSE, RATHER THAN RESPONDING TO “WHAT IS.” THEY NO LONGER“LISTEN” TO CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY “RECITE” THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. WITHIN THEABSOLUTE THERE IS JUST NO DISTINCTION.JKD:A NEW STYLE?TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A “NEW” STYLE, “COMPOSITE,”“MODIFIED,” OR OTHERWISE; THAT IS, SET WITHIN A DISTINCT FORM AS APART FROM“THIS” METHOD OR “THAT” METHOD. ON THE CONTRARY, I HOPE TO FREE MY FOLLOWERSFROM CLINGING TO STYLES, PATTERNS, OR MOLDS. REMEMBER THAT JEET KUNE DO ISMERELY A NAME USED, A MIRROR IN WHICH WE SEE OURSELVES. THE BRAND NAME ISNOTHING SPECIAL.WHAT IS A CLASSICAL STYLE?UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH, THERE IS NEVER A SERIES OF RULES, ACLASSIFICATION OF TECHNIQUES, AND SO FORTH, THAT CONSTITUTE A SO-CALLED JKDSYSTEM/METHOD OF FIGHTING. TO BEGIN WITH, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ASYSTEM/METHOD OF FIGHTING; ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME SORT OF A PROGRESSIVE APPROACHTO TRAINING. TO CREATE A METHOD OF FIGHTING IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE [TRYING TO] PUTA POUND OF WATER INTO WRAPPING PAPER AND SHAPE IT. ITS SHAPE SEEMS TO DEPEND ONRELATIONSHIP.[../Images/155a.jpg]IN A WAY, WATER IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF JKD. STRUCTURALLY, PEOPLE TEND TO MISTAKEJKD FOR A COMPOSITE STYLE BECAUSE ITS EFFICIENCY LIES IN USING ANY MEANS TOSCORE, MUCH LIKE WATER FINDING ITS WAY TO A CRACK. BECAUSE JKD IS NEITHEROPPOSED TO STYLE NOR NOT OPPOSED TO STYLE, ONE CAN SAY IT IS OUTSIDE AS WELL ASINSIDE OF ALL PARTICULAR STRUCTURES AND DISTINCT STYLES. ALSO BECAUSE JKD CLAIMSNOT TO BE A STYLE, SOME PEOPLE CONCLUDED THAT MAYBE JKD IS BEING NEUTRAL ORMAYBE SIMPLY INDIFFERENT. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE CASE, FOR JKD IS BOTH AT ONCE“THIS” AND “NOT THIS.” TO FULLY UNDERSTAND, ONE MUST TRANSCEND THE DUALITY OF“FOR” AND “AGAINST” INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE. A GOOD MARTIAL ARTIST RESTS INDIRECT INTUITION.WHAT IS A CLASSICAL STYLE OF MARTIAL ART? FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE MUST REALIZETHE FACT THAT MAN CREATED STYLES. DISREGARD THE MANY ROMANTIC HISTORICALORIGINATIONS OF THE FOUNDER—BY A WISE OLD MONK, BY A SPECIAL MESSENGER IN ADREAM OR IN A REVELATION, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. A STYLE SHOULD NEVER BE LIKEA BIBLE, THE LAWS AND PRINCIPLES OF WHICH CAN NEVER BE VIOLATED. SO NO MATTERWHAT PROPAGANDA HAS BEEN SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES, A CLASSICAL STYLECOMES ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A HUMAN BEING. OF COURSE, BEING HUMAN BEINGS, THEREWILL ALWAYS BE DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO QUALITY OF TRAINING, PHYSICAL MAKEUP,LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, LIKES AND DISLIKES, AND SOFORTH. CONSEQUENTLY, MOST CLASSICAL STYLES WERE SET UP AND ACCUMULATED FROMSOMEONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATION UNDER GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES.THE FOUNDER MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO A PARTIAL TRUTH, BUT AS TIME GOES BY THISPARTIAL TRUTH BECOMES A SECT, A LAW, OR—WORSE STILL—A PREJUDICIAL FAITH.FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO PASS ALONG THIS “KNOWLEDGE” FROM GENERATION TOGENERATION, THE VARIOUS RESPONSES HAD TO BE ORGANIZED AND CLASSIFIED ANDPRESENTED IN LOGICAL ORDER. SO WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF AS SOME SORT OFPERSONAL FLUIDITY ON THE PART OF ITS FOUNDER IS NOW SOLIDIFIED KNOWLEDGE,PRESERVED AND PACKAGED FOR MANY YOUNGER GENERATIONS AS WELL AS WORLDWIDE MASSDISTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS MASS INDOCTRINATION.BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ORGANIZATION AND PRESERVATION, PRETTY SOON THE MEANSBECOME SO ELABORATED THAT TREMENDOUS ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THEM, AND PRETTYSOON THE END IS FORGOTTEN. OF COURSE, MANY MORE “DIFFERENT” STYLES WOULD SPRINGUP, PROBABLY AS A DIRECT REACTION TO “THE OTHER’S” TRUTH. EACH CLAIMS TO POSSESSTHE HIGHEST TRUTH TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER STYLES. WHEN ONE WANTS TO STUDYTHE TREE, IS IT NOT FUTILE TO ARGUE AS TO WHICH SINGLE LEAF, WHICH DESIGN OFBRANCHES, OR WHICH ATTRACTIVE FLOWER ONE LIKES? FOR WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THEROOT, YOU UNDERSTAND ALL ITS BLOSSOMING. BY THE WAY, PLASTIC PLANTS MIGHT LOOKPRETTY—THAT IS, IF YOU LIKE DEAD THINGS.THE PROFESSED CURE OF A CLASSICAL STYLE IS ITSELF A DISEASE. A STYLE “SETS” AND“TRAPS” PARTIAL REALITY INTO A CHOICE MOLD. AS A RESULT, ITS PRACTITIONERS AREBEING ENCLOSED WITHIN THE STYLE’S LIMITATION, WHICH IS DEFINITELY LESS THANTHEIR OWN POTENTIAL (DISCUSS P. C.’S “CONTROL”).MANY PRACTITIONERS OF THE MARTIAL ART ARE USUALLY SECOND-HAND ARTISTS. THEYSELDOM LEARN TO DEPEND UPON THEMSELVES FOR EXPRESSION; RATHER, THEY FAITHFULLYFOLLOW AN IMPOSED PATTERN. TO BE SURE, MANY OF THEM HAVE GAINED “ROUTINEEFFICIENCY” AS PRESCRIBED/OUTLINED BY THAT PARTICULAR PATTERN. HOWEVER, THEYHAVE NOT COME TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES, FOR ULTIMATELY KNOWLEDGE IN MARTIAL ARTMEANS SELF-KNOWLEDGE. SO ONE MUST NOT BLINDLY FOLLOW A STERILE PATTERN. BLINDLYFOLLOWING A STERILE PATTERN WOULD DEFINITELY CRAM AND DISTORT OUR NATURALGROWTH. INSTEAD, THROUGH SELF-EXPLORATION, FLEXIBLE AWARENESS, ANDSELF-EXPRESSION ONE FINDS HIMSELF. SUCH SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS A CONTINUING PROCESS,AND THE ARTIST THAT POSSESSES SUCH QUALITY EXPRESSES HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOSTFREEDOM.FREEDOM IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE PRECONCEIVED, AND FLUIDITY IS DEFINITELY NOTRESISTING THE NATURAL UNRHYTHMIC FLOW WITH ONE’S PARTIAL SET PATTERN. REMEMBERTHAT PARTIAL PREFORMULATED PARTIALITY LACKS FLEXIBILITY TO COPE WITH THEEVER-CHANGING TOTALITY. MANY DIFFERENT “STYLISTS” HAVE BECOME DESENSITIZED,PATTERNIZED ROBOTS. THEY BECOME THOSE ORGANIZED FORMS, VICTIMS OF CONDITIONINGHANDED DOWN FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. A MARTIAL ARTIST IS NEVER A REPLICA OF“THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” STYLE. HE IS DEFINITELY NOT A PRODUCT BUT A LIVEINDIVIDUAL, AND REMEMBER, THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THESYSTEM.IN TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ART, BEING WISE SEEMS TO BE A PROCESS OFACCUMULATION—LIKE A WHITE BELT KNOWS TWO SETS, A BROWN BELT HAS FOUR SETS, ANDSO ON. THIS IS NOT TRUE. IN JKD THE PROCESS IS NOT THAT OF ACCUMULATING FIXEDKNOWLEDGE; RATHER IT IS A PROCESS OF DISCOVERING THE CAUSE OF IGNORANCE. MOSTOFTEN IT INVOLVES A SHEDDING PROCESS, A SORT OF DAILY DECREASE RATHER THAN ADAILY INCREASE. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT FREEDOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US, AND IT ISNOT SOMETHING TO BE GAINED TOWARD THE END THROUGH FOLLOWING SOME PARTICULARFORMULA. WE DO NOT “BECOME,” WE SIMPLY “ARE.” THE TRAINING IN MARTIAL ART ISTOWARD THIS END, OF “BEING” MIND, RATHER THAN “HAVING” MIND. STERILE PATTERN ISINCAPABLE OF SUCH LIVELINESS AND FRESHNESS. PREFORMULATIONS ONLY LIMIT ANDCONTROL THE PRACTITIONER. ALSO, THE MYSTICAL MIND TRAINING PROMOTES NOT THEPROMISED/SO-CALLED INTERNAL POWER, BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTIPATION. WHETHER IT ISINWARD OR OUTWARD TRAINING, THE JKD TECHNIQUES ARE USED TO LIBERATE THE SPIRITRATHER THAN TO BIND THE BODY.OFTENTIMES THE QUESTION IS ASKED AS TO WHETHER JKD IS AGAINST FORM. IN ANYPHYSICAL MOVEMENT THERE IS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND LIVELY MANNER TO CARRY ITOUT, THAT IS, REGARDING LEVERAGE, BALANCE, ECONOMICAL USE OF MOTION, AND SOFORTH. HOWEVER, LIVE, EFFICIENT FORM IS ONE THING, A STERILE CLASSICAL SET THATBINDS AND CONDITIONS IS ANOTHER. ALSO, THERE IS A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN“HAVING NO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM.” THE FIRST IS IGNORANCE; THE SECOND,TRANSCENDENCE.TRUTH IS A PATHLESS ROAD. JEET KUNE DO IS FRESH RED BLOOD HANDED DOWN IN HUMANVEINS AND VESSELS. IT IS TOTAL AWARENESS THAT HAS NO “BEFORE” OR “AFTER.” THUSIT IS NOT AN ORGANIZED INSTITUTION THAT ONE CAN BE A MEMBER OF. EITHER YOUUNDERSTAND OR YOU DON’T, AND THAT IS THAT. WHEN I WAS TEACHING MY CHINESE SYSTEMOF GUNG FU, I HAD A SYSTEM THEM. UPON MY ARRIVAL IN THE STATES, I DID HAVE MY“CHINESE” INSTITUTE; BUT SINCE THEN I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN SYSTEMS (CHINESE ORNOT CHINESE), NOR ORGANIZATIONS. BIG ORGANIZATIONS, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGNBRANCHES, AFFILIATIONS, AND SO FORTH, ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE PLACES WHERE AMARTIAL ARTIST DISCOVERS/FINDS HIMSELF. MORE OFTEN THIS IS QUITE TO THECONTRARY. TO REACH THE GROWING NUMBER OF STUDENTS, SOME SORT OF A PRE-CONFORMEDSET MUST BE ESTABLISHED AS STANDARDS FOR THE BRANCHES TO FOLLOW. AS A RESULT,ALL MEMBERS WILL BE CONDITIONED ACCORDING TO THE PRESCRIBED SYSTEM. MANY WILLPROBABLY END UP AS PRISONERS OF A SYSTEMATIZED DRILL.I BELIEVE IN TEACHING/HAVING A FEW PUPILS AT ONE TIME, AS TEACHING REQUIRES ACONSTANT ALERT OBSERVATION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A DIRECTRELATIONSHIP. A GOOD TEACHER CAN NEVER BE FIXED IN A ROUTINE, AND NOWADAYS MANYARE JUST THAT. DURING TEACHING, EACH MOMENT REQUIRES A SENSITIVE MIND THAT ISCONSTANTLY CHANGING AND CONSTANTLY ADAPTING. ABOVE ALL, A TEACHER MUST NEVERFORCE HIS STUDENT TO FIT HIS FAVORITE PATTERN, [WHICH] IS A PREFORMATION. AS APOINTER OF THE WAY OF TRUTH, EXPOSING HIS STUDENT’S VULNERABILITY, CAUSING HIMTO EXPLORE BOTH INTERNALLY (WITHIN) AND EXTERNALLY, AND FINALLY INTEGRATINGHIMSELF WITH HIS BEING. THE PROCESS IS MUCH LIKE CARING FOR A RIPENING FRUIT,LETTING IT HAPPEN. FRUIT IS FRESH, JUICY, AND FULL OF LIFE. OF COURSE, A PLASTICONE MIGHT APPEAR TO BE “MORE BEAUTIFUL.”[../Images/159a.jpg]MANY [MARTIAL] ART INSTRUCTORS HAVE SAID THAT MARTIAL ART IS LIFE ITSELF;HOWEVER, I WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM REALLY APPRECIATE AND TRULY UNDERSTAND.WITHOUT A DOUBT, LIFE DOES NOT MEAN A PARTIALIZED SOMETHING, A FRAME. LIFE IS ACONSTANT MOVEMENT, UNRHYTHMIC MOVEMENT, AS WELL AS CONSTANT CHANGE. INSTEAD OFFLOWING WITH THIS CHANGE, MANY OF THE MARTIAL ART LEADERS/“MASTERS,” PAST ANDPRESENT, HAVE BUILT AN ILLUSION OF FIXED FORMS, SOLIDIFYING THE EVER FLOWING,DISSECTING THE TOTALITY, ORGANIZING FAVORITE PATTERNS, PLANNING SPONTANEITY,SEPARATING THE UNITY INTO DUALITY OF THE SOFT VERSUS THE HARD, AND SO FORTH. ITIS NO WONDER THAT OUR NATURAL GROWTH IS BLOCKED BY THE VAIN REPETITION OFSOMEONE ELSE’S IMPOSED PATTERN. MARTIAL ART IS NOT SIMPLY THE PHYSICAL ACT OFFILLING TIME AND SPACE THROUGH SOME SORT OF DRILL-/PRECISION-LIKE MOVEMENT.MACHINES CAN DO THAT, TOO. NOR IS MARTIAL ART A BUNCH OF INTELLECTUAL DISCOURSESOR CIRCUS ACTS. A MARTIAL ARTIST MUST BE TOTALLY AWARE AND CAPABLE OF EXPRESSINGHIMSELF CREATIVELY. HIS PHYSICAL MOVEMENT IS HIS SOUL MADE VISIBLE. INDEED,MARTIAL ART IS THE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF THE HUMAN SOUL.MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY OR MANIPULATING SKILL IS NEVER AS IMPORTANT AS THEEXPOSURE TO OUR INWARD AWARENESS. REMEMBER, A MARTIAL ARTIST IS NOT MERELY THEPHYSICAL EXPONENT OF SOME PROWESS HE MAY HAVE BEEN GIFTED WITH IN THE FIRSTPLACE. AS HE MATURES, HE WILL REALIZE THAT HIS KICK OR PUNCH IS REALLY NOT ASMUCH A TOOL TO CONQUER HIS OPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGH HISCONSCIOUSNESS, HIS EGO, AND ALL HIS MENTAL BLOCKS. INDEED, ALL THE TOOLS AREULTIMATELY MEANS FOR PENETRATING THE DEPTH OF HIS BEING SO THAT HE WILL ACHIEVE[AND/OR] REGAIN THIS EQUILIBRIUM OF HIS INNER CENTER OF GRAVITY. WITH THISINWARD VITAL LOOSENING FLOWS HIS OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF HIS TOOLS. BEHIND EACHPHYSICAL MOVEMENT IS HIS WHOLENESS OF BEING, THIS ALL-INCLUSIVE AWARENESS.FINALLY, A JKD MAN WHO SAYS JKD IS EXCLUSIVELY JKD IS SIMPLY NOT IN WITH IT. HEIS STILL HUNG UP ON HIS SELF-CLOSING RESISTANCE; IN THIS CASE, HE IS ANCHOREDDOWN IN A REACTIONARY PATTERN, AND NATURALLY HE IS STILL BOUND BY ANOTHERMODIFIED PATTERN AND CAN MOVE ONLY WITHIN ITS LIMITS. HE HAS NOT DIGESTED THESIMPLE FACT THAT TRUTH EXISTS OUTSIDE OF ALL MOLDS AND PATTERNS, AND AWARENESSIS NEVER EXCLUSIVE.AGAIN, LET ME REMIND YOU THAT JKD IS MERELY JUST A NAME USED, A BOAT TO GET ONEACROSS, AND ONCE ACROSS, IT IS TO BE DISCARDED, AND NOT TO BE CARRIED ON ONE’SBACK. THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS AT BEST ARE MERELY A FINGER POINTING TO THE MOON.PLEASE DO NOT FIX YOUR GAZE ON THE FINGER AND MISS ALL THE HEAVENLY GLORY. AFTERALL, THE USEFULNESS OF THE FINGER IS IN POINTING AWAY FROM ITSELF TO THE LIGHTTHAT ILLUMINES FINGER AND ALL.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S ESSAY ENTITLED “TOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION (JKD),” CIRCA1971. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.5-GPARTIAL CONDITIONING (JEET KUNE DO: VI)A PERSON CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS,” SAY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BOXER, AWRESTLER, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD, BECAUSE HE WILL SEETHE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULAR CONDITIONING. EVERY ATTEMPTTO DESCRIBE THE FIGHT IS REALLY ONE’S “VERSION” OF IT, A MENTAL REPLICA OR APARTIAL IDEA OF THE ACTUAL FIGHT, DEPENDING ON HIS LIKES AND DISLIKES.FIGHTING IS DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A CHINESEMARTIAL ARTIST, A JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTIST, AND SO FORTH, NOR IS IT SOMETHINGBASED ON YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE CASE OF THE BOXER: HEPROBABLY WILL CRITICIZE THE POINT THAT THE TWO FIGHTERS ARE TOO CLOSE TO ALLOW“CRISPY” PUNCHING ROOM. WHILE THE WRESTLER ON THE OTHER HAND WILL COMPLAIN THATONE OF THE FIGHTERS SHOULD “CROWD” AND SMOTHER THE OTHER’S “CRISPINESS,” THUSBEING CLOSE ENOUGH TO APPLY GRAPPLING TACTICS. SO IN A SPLIT SECOND BETWEEN THEABOVE TWO STATEMENTS—WHEN VIEWED FROM TOTALITY—THE BOXER COULD HAVE SWITCHEDINTO SMOTHERING GRAPPLING TACTICS WHEN THERE IS NO CRISPY PUNCHING ROOM. THEWRESTLER, WHEN OUT OF DISTANCE, COULD HAVE EITHER KICKED OR PUNCHED AS A MEANSTO BRIDGE THE GAP FOR HIS SPECIALTY. TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOIDOF SET PATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.A PERSON CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS,” SAY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A BOXER, AWRESTLER, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD, BECAUSE HE WILL SEETHE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULAR CONDITIONING.A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY—THE IMPORTANT WORD HERE IS FULLY—WHEN APARTIAL SET STRUCTURE OR STYLE IS IMPOSED ON HIM. FIGHTING “AS IS” IS TOTAL(INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS” AS WELL AS ALL “THAT IS NOT”), WITHOUT BOUNDARIES ORLINES, ALWAYS ALIVE AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING. NOW HOW CAN ONE HAVE FLEXIBLEAWARENESS WHEN THERE IS A SCREEN OF ONE’S SET PATTERN OF “WHAT SHOULD BE” ASOPPOSED TO “WHAT IS”? SET PATTERNS JUST ARE NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH FOR CHANGES ANDADAPTATION. BECAUSE A PERSON DOES NOT WANT TO BE LEFT UNCERTAIN OR INSECURE, HE“ORGANIZES” A CHOICE PATTERN OF COMBAT, A PATTERN OF ARTIFICIAL RELATIONSHIPWITH THE OPPONENT, A PLANNED SPONTANEITY, AND SO FORTH. FROM IMITATIVE DRILLINGON SUCH ORGANIZED “LAND-SWIMMING PATTERNS” THE PRACTITIONER’S MARGIN OF FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION GROWS NARROWER AND NARROWER. THE WRONG MEANS WILL LEAD TO THEWRONG END, AND IT WON’T BE LONG BEFORE HE WILL BECOME PARALYZED WITHIN THEFRAMEWORK OF SUCH PATTERNS AND WILL ACCEPT THE LIMITED PATTERNS AS REALITY, THEUNLIMITED. IN FACT, MANY MARTIAL ARTISTS ARE MERELY PERFORMING THEIR METHODICALROUTINES AS RESPONSE, RATHER THAN RESPONDING TO “WHAT IS.” THEY NO LONGER“LISTEN” TO CIRCUMSTANCES; THEY “RECITE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES.”A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY—THE IMPORTANT WORD HERE IS FULLY—WHEN APARTIAL SET STRUCTURE OR STYLE IS IMPOSED ON HIM. FIGHTING “AS IS” IS TOTAL(INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS” AS WELL AS ALL “THAT IS NOT”), WITHOUT BOUNDARIES ORLINES, ALWAYS ALIVE AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING.IS JKD A NEW STYLE?TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE OR A MODIFIED STYLE,THAT IS, A STYLE SET WITHIN DISTINCT FORM AS APART FROM “THIS” METHOD OR “THAT”METHOD. ON THE CONTRARY, I HOPE TO FREE MY FOLLOWERS FROM STYLES, PATTERNS, ORMOLDS. JEET KUNE DO IS MERELY A NAME USED, AND THROUGH THIS ANALOGY, A MIRROR INWHICH TO SEE OURSELVES.IN REALITY, THE PROFESSED CURE OF A PATTERN IS ITSELF A DISEASE, FOR IT “SETS”AND “TRAPS” REALITY INTO A CHOICE MOLD. JUST AS ONE CANNOT GET A PIECE OF PAPERTO WRAP AND SHAPE WATER, FIGHTING CAN NEVER BE MADE TO CONFORM TO ANY ONESYSTEM. FREEDOM SIMPLY CANNOT BE PRECONCEIVED, AND WHEN THERE IS FREEDOM, THEREIS NEITHER GOOD NOR ITS REACTION AS BAD. THERE ARE NO DISTINCTIONS WITHIN THEABSOLUTE.[../Images/163a.jpg]MY CONCERNS ARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNKNOWINGLY BEING CONDITIONED AND SOLIDIFIEDBY A PARTIALIZED AND HIGHLY CLASSICAL STRUCTURE, GAINING ONLY “ROUTINEEFFICIENCY” RATHER THAN THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS ONESELF. IN MOST CASES, THEY HAVEBECOME DESENSITIZED, PATTERNIZED ROBOTS, LISTENING TO THEIR OWN SCREAMS AND LOUDYELLS. THEY ARE THOSE ORGANIZED FORMS. THEY ARE THOSE CLASSICAL BLOCKS. INSHORT, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CONDITIONING.ONE SHOULD NEVER LOOK AT COMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE, BUT FROM ALL POSSIBLEANGLES. THAT IS WHY IN JEET KUNE DO ONE IS TAUGHT TO UTILIZE ALL WAYS AND MEANSTO SERVE ITS END (EFFICIENCY IS NOT THE ADHERENCE TO CLASSICAL FORM; EFFICIENCYIS ANYTHING THAT SCORES), BUT, AND THAT IS A RATHER IMPORTANT “BUT,” HE IS BOUNDBY NONE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE STRUCTURE OF JKD, THOUGH POSSESSED OF ALL POSSIBLEANGLES, IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED. THE REASON IS SIMPLE: ANY STRUCTURE, HOWEVERINTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED, BECOMES A CAGE IF THE STUDENT IS OBSESSED WITH IT. THUSA GOOD STUDENT IS ONE WHO IS ABLE TO ENTER A MOLD BUT NOT BE CAGED IN IT, TOFOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES, YET WITHOUT BEING LIMITED OR BOUND BY THEM. THIS ISIMPORTANT, FOR A PLIABLE, CHOICELESS OBSERVATION WITHOUT EXCLUSION IS SOESSENTIAL IN THE CULTIVATION OF JKD. SO WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE IS NOT TO HAVE ANORGANIZED PHILOSOPHY OF COMBAT, OR, FOR THAT MATTER, A METHOD OF COMBAT, BUT TOOBSERVE NEUTRALLY WHAT IS TAKING PLACE IN ACTUAL COMBAT, INWARDLY AS WELL ASOUTWARDLY.[../Images/164a.jpg]JKD BELIEVES THAT FREEDOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US, AND [IS] NOT SOMETHING TO BEGAINED TOWARD THE END THROUGH SOME PROCESS OF ACCUMULATION. WE DO NOT “BECOME,”WE SIMPLY “ARE.” THE TRAINING IS TOWARD THIS, OF “BEING” MIND, RATHER THAN“HAVING” MIND. THE TRANSFORMED STATE IS MERELY A STATE OF “BEING” AND NOT ASTATE OF “BECOMING”; IT IS NOT AN IDEAL, AN END TO BE DESIRED AND ACHIEVED.STERILE PATTERN MERELY DISTORTS AND CRAMS ITS PRACTITIONERS AND THE MYSTICALMIND TRAINING PROMOTES NOT INTERNAL POWER BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTIPATION.WHETHER IT IS INWARD OR OUTWARD TRAINING, THE JKD TECHNIQUE USED IS MEANT TOLIBERATE THE SPIRIT RATHER THAN TO BIND THE BODY. TO DEFINE JKD AS A PARTICULARSYSTEM (GUNG FU, KARATE, KICKBOXING, AND SO FORTH) IS TO MISS THE POINTCOMPLETELY. IT IS OUTSIDE OF ALL PARTICULAR STRUCTURES AND DISTINCT STYLES.DEFINITION:A STYLE IS A CLASSIFIED RESPONSE TO ONE’S CHOSEN INCLINATIONJEET KUNE DO IS NEVER A METHOD OF CLASSIFIED TECHNIQUES, BUT A MEANS OF TOTALSELF-EXPRESSION. THERE IS NEVER A SERIES OF RULES, TECHNIQUES, LAWS, PRINCIPLES,AND SO FORTH, THAT CONSTITUTES A SYSTEM OF FIGHTING. FOR JKD IS A PROCESS BUTNOT A GOAL, A CONSTANT MOVEMENT RATHER THAN AN ESTABLISHED, FIXED PATTERN; BOTHTHE MEANS AND THE END, TO BE SURE, BUT NEVER A MEANS TO AN END. MANY PEOPLEMISTAKE JKD FOR A COMPOSITE STYLE OR BEING NEUTRAL OR SIMPLY INDIFFERENT. THISIS NOT TRUE, FOR IT IS BOTH AT ONCE “THIS” AND “NOT THIS.” SO JKD IS NEITHEROPPOSED TO STYLES NOR NOT OPPOSED TO THEM. TO UNDERSTAND, ONE MUST TRANSCEND THEDUALITY OF “FOR” AND “AGAINST” INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE. A GOOD JKD MAN RESTS INDIRECT INTUITION.PEOPLE OFTEN MISTAKENLY [BELIEVE] THAT JKD IS AGAINST FORM. I DON’T THINK I’LLGO INTO DETAIL ON THAT, AS OTHER PARAGRAPHS WILL CLARIFY THAT. ONE THING WE MUSTUNDERSTAND: THAT IS, THERE IS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER TO CARRYOUT A MOVEMENT (AND THAT THE BASIC LAWS OF LEVERAGE, BODY POSITION, BALANCE,FOOTWORK, AND SO FORTH, ARE NOT TO BE VIOLATED). HOWEVER, ALIVE, EFFICIENT FORMIS ONE THING; STERILE CLASSICAL SETS THAT BIND AND CONDITION ARE ANOTHER. ASIDEFROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED, ONE MUST ALSO DISTINGUISH THE SUBTLETY BETWEEN “HAVINGNO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM.” THE FIRST IS IGNORANCE, THE SECOND TRANSCENDENCE.THE FINAL AIM OF JKD IS TOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION. THE INSTRUCTIONS SIMPLYPOINT THE WAY TO INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND MATURED INWARDNESS. JEET KUNE DO NEVERIMPOSES A SET PATTERN ON ITS PRACTITIONERS. MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY ORMANIPULATORY SKILL IS NEVER AS IMPORTANT AS THE INWARD AWARENESS GAINED.REMEMBER THE FACT THAT A MARTIAL ART MAN IS NOT MERELY A PHYSICAL EXPONENT OFSOME PROWESS HE MAY HAVE BEEN GIFTED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE.26[../Text/Notes.xhtml#pg1_26]AS HE MATURES, HE WILL REALIZE THAT HIS KICK IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH A TOOL TOCONQUER HIS OPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGH HIS EGO, HIS ANGER, HISCONSCIOUSNESS, AND SO FORTH. IN FACT, ALL THE TOOLS ARE ULTIMATELY MEANS FORPENETRATING THE DEPTH OF HIS BEING, SO THAT HE WILL ACHIEVE THISIMPERTURBABILITY OF HIS INNER CENTER OF GRAVITY. WITH THIS INWARD VITALLOOSENING FLOWS HIS OUTWARD EXPRESSION OF HIS TOOLS. SO WE HEAR OF SUCHEXPRESSIONS AS “IT KICKS” INSTEAD OF “I KICK.” IT SIMPLY MEANS THE KICK ISDELIVERED WITH THIS WHOLENESS OF BEING, THIS ALL-INCLUSIVE ATTITUDE, WITHOUT THEUTMOST CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE KICKER. ALL THE TRAINING IS TO ROUND HIM UP TO BE ACOMPLETE MAN AND NOT SOME SORT OF SUPERMAN. TO BE A MAN OF FREEDOM IS MOREIMPORTANT THAN TO BE A GREAT FIGHTER.TRUTH IS A PATHLESS ROAD. IT IS TOTAL EXPRESSION THAT HAS NO “BEFORE” OR“AFTER.” SIMILARLY, JKD IS NOT AN ORGANIZED INSTITUTION THAT ONE CAN BE A MEMBEROF. EITHER YOU UNDERSTAND OR YOU DON’T, AND THAT IS THAT. I NEVER BELIEVE INLARGE ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN BRANCHES, AFFILIATIONS,HONORARY MEMBERS, AND SO FORTH. TO REACH THE MASSES, SOME SORT OF APRECONFORMED, SET SYSTEM IS REQUIRED. AS A RESULT, THE MEMBERS ARE CONDITIONEDACCORDING TO THAT SYSTEM.I BELIEVE IN TEACHING JUST A FEW STUDENTS, AS TEACHING REQUIRES A CONSTANT ALERTOBSERVATION ON EACH INDIVIDUAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. AGOOD TEACHER CANNOT BE FIXED IN A ROUTINE, AND MANY ARE JUST THAT. DURINGTEACHING, EACH MOMENT REQUIRES A SENSITIVE MIND THAT IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING ANDCONSTANTLY ADAPTING. THE TEACHER MUST NEVER IMPOSE A LIFELESS PATTERN, APREFORMATION, ON HIS STUDENT. THUS UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ARTS THAT AREHANDED ON BY PRECEPTS OF FIXED FORMS, JKD CAN ONLY BE TAUGHT BY PERSONAL ANDINDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCING IN THE LIVING PRESENT.INSTEAD OF ACCEPTANCE OF CHANGE, MANY SO-CALLED LEADERS HAVE BUILT AN ILLUSIONOF FIXED FORMS AND THE DUALITY OF THE SOFT VERSUS THE HARD. OUR GROWTH ISBLOCKED IN THIS ENDLESS REPETITION OF SYSTEMATIZED PATTERN. MANY MARTIAL ARTINSTRUCTORS HAVE SAID THAT MARTIAL ART IS LIFE ITSELF; HOWEVER, ONLY A FEWREALLY UNDERSTAND. TO BE SURE, LIFE DOES NOT MEAN STAGNATION, A STERILE PATTERN,SOMETHING LIFELESS. LIFE IS A CONSTANT MOVEMENT, UNRHYTHMIC MOVEMENT. IT ISCHANGE, TRANSFORMATION, AND ALL THAT. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY FILL TIME ANDSPACE THROUGH SOME SORT OF ORGANIZED MOVEMENTS; MACHINES CAN DO THAT TOO.[../Images/167a.jpg]A MARTIAL ARTIST MUST EXPRESS HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST FREEDOM. HE MUST BE AWARE.HIS PHYSICAL MOVEMENT IS HIS SOUL MADE VISIBLE. INDEED, MARTIAL ART IS THEEXPRESSION OF THE HUMAN SOUL.IN MOST CASES, A PRACTITIONER OF THE MARTIAL ART IS A SECONDHAND ARTIST, ACONFORMER. HE SELDOM LEARNS TO DEPEND UPON HIMSELF FOR EXPRESSION. RATHER, HEFAITHFULLY FOLLOWS AN IMPOSED PATTERN. SO AS TIME GOES BY, HE WILL PROBABLYUNDERSTAND SOME DEAD ROUTINES AND BE SKILLFUL ACCORDING TO THAT PATTERN, BUT HEHAS NOT COME TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, HE HAS GAINED CONTROL OF THEMANIPULATIVE SKILL HE HAS, BUT NOT CONTROL OF WHAT HE IS HIMSELF. ONLYSELF-KNOWLEDGE IN TURN LEADS TO FREEDOM. A LIVE PERSON IS NOT A MOLDEDREPRODUCTION OF THIS STYLE OR THAT STYLE. HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL, AND THEINDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SYSTEM.JEET KUNE DO IS NOT FOR ANYONE. I HAVE TAUGHT MANY PUPILS, BUT VERY FEW BECOMEMY DISCIPLES. MANY OF THE STUDENTS DO NOT SHOW THEIR CAPABILITY OFUNDERSTANDING, NOR THE APPLICATION OF IT IN THE RIGHT WAY, PHYSICALLY ORMENTALLY. MARTIAL ART MUST NOT BE HANDED OUT INDISCRIMINATELY TO ANYONE; THESTUDENT MUST BE DESERVING OF IT. I SELDOM TRUST THE BLACK BELTERS WHO KNOCKED ONTHE DOOR FOR INSTRUCTION. WISDOM TO ME IS SOMETHING SACRED AND I HAVE GREATRESPECT FOR IT. UNLESS THE PROSPECT PROVES HIS WORTH AND TRUST, I WILL NOTTEACH. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT HIS STATUS IS.IN MARTIAL ART, MANY INSTRUCTORS DERIVE THEIR TECHNIQUES AND PRINCIPLES FROMINTELLECTUAL THEORIES AND NOT FROM FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE. INSTRUCTORS LIKE THESECAN TALK “ABOUT” COMBAT, AND THERE ARE MANY MASTER TALKERS, BUT THEY CANNOTREALLY TEACH IT. THEY MIGHT CREATE THIS LAW AND THAT WAY, BUT THE STUDENTS UNDERTHEM WILL MERELY BE CONDITIONED AND CONTROLLED RATHER THAN FREEING THEMSELVES TOBE BETTER ARTISTS. IN TRUTH, THEY ARE BEING ENCLOSED WITHIN THE SYSTEM’SLIMITATION, WHICH IS DEFINITELY LESS THAN THEIR OWN POTENTIAL AS LIVE HUMANBEINGS. THE MORE RESTRICTED A METHOD, THE LESSER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE’SINDIVIDUAL FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.AN EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR IS AN EXCELLENT ATHLETE. I AM SURE AS HE ADVANCES INAGE, HE WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH A GOOD YOUNG MAN. HOWEVER, HE HAS NOEXCUSE NOT TO BE A SUPERB ARTIST AMONG HIS CONTEMPORARIES, PHYSICALLY ANDMENTALLY. AN UNFIT AND INACTIVE INSTRUCTOR MIGHT BE OF HELP TO THE MEDIOCRESTUDENTS, BUT HE CAN NEVER TRULY FEEL OR UNDERSTAND.FINALLY, A JKD MAN WHO SAYS JKD IS EXCLUSIVELY JKD IS SIMPLY NOT IN WITH IT. HEIS STILL HUNG UP ON HIS SELF-CLOSING RESISTANCE; IN THIS CASE HE IS ANCHOREDDOWN TO A REACTIONARY PATTERN, AND NATURALLY HE IS STILL BOUND BY ANOTHERMODIFIED PATTERN AND CAN ONLY MOVE WITHIN ITS LIMITS. HE HAS NOT DIGESTED THESIMPLE FACT THAT TRUTH EXISTS OUTSIDE OF ALL MOLDS AND PATTERNS, AND AWARENESSIS NEVER EXCLUSIVE. JEET KUNE DO IS MERELY A NAME USED, A BOAT TO GET ONEACROSS, AND, ONCE ACROSS, IS TO BE DISCARDED, AND NOT CARRIED ON ONE’S BACK. LETME ALSO SAY THAT THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS AT BEST ARE MERELY A FINGER POINTING TOTHE MOON. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE FINGER TO BE THE MOON.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S ESSAY ENTITLED “PARTIAL CONDITIONING,” CIRCA 1971. BRUCE LEEPAPERS.5-HJKD (JEET KUNE DO: VII)ANYTIME SOME OTHER WRITERS WRITE ABOUT JEET KUNE DO, THEY WRITE ABOUT ITACCORDING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE. ONE CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS,” SAY FROM THE POINTOF VIEW OF A BOXER, A WRESTLER, OR ANYONE WHO IS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD,BECAUSE A PERSON WILL SEE THE FIGHT ACCORDING TO THE LIMITS OF HIS PARTICULARCONDITIONING.[../Images/169a.jpg]FIGHTING IS NOT SOMETHING DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A CHINESE MARTIALARTIST, A JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTIST, AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WRESTLER WILLCOMPLAIN THAT ONE OF THE FIGHTERS SHOULD CROWD AND SMOTHER THE OTHER’S“CRISPINESS,” AND THUS BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO APPLY GRAPPLING TACTICS. SO IN A SPLITSECOND BETWEEN THE ABOVE TWO STATEMENTS, THE BOXER COULD HAVE SWITCHED INTOGRAPPLING TACTICS WHEN THERE IS NO CRISPY PUNCHING ROOM. THE WRESTLER, WHEN OUTOF DISTANCE, COULD HAVE KICKED OR PUNCHED AS A MEANS OF BRIDGING THE GAP FOR HISSPECIALTY. TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF SET PATTERNS, ANDFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.ONE CANNOT “EXPRESS” FULLY—THE IMPORTANT WORD HERE IS FULLY—WHEN ONE IS IMPOSEDBY A PARTIAL STRUCTURE OR STYLE. FOR HOW CAN ONE BE TRULY AWARE WHEN THERE IS ASCREEN OF ONE’S SET PATTERN AS OPPOSED TO “WHAT IS?” WHAT IS TOTAL (INCLUDINGWHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT), WITHOUT BOUNDARIES, AND SO FORTH. FROM DRILLING ONSUCH AN ORGANIZED “LAND SWIMMING” PATTERN, THE PRACTITIONER’S MARGIN OF FREEDOMOF EXPRESSION GROWS NARROWER AND NARROWER. HE BECOMES PARALYZED WITHIN THEFRAMEWORK OF THE PATTERN AND ACCEPTS THE PATTERN AS THE REAL THING. HE NO LONGER“LISTENS” TO CIRCUMSTANCES, HE “RECITES” HIS CIRCUMSTANCES.HE IS MERELY PERFORMING HIS METHODICAL ROUTINE AS [A] RESPONSE RATHER THANRESPONDING TO WHAT IS. THEY ARE DESENSITIZED PATTERNIZED ROBOTS, LISTENING TOTHEIR OWN SCREAMS AND YELLS. THEY ARE THOSE CLASSICAL BLOCKS; THEY ARE THOSEORGANIZED FORMS; IN SHORT, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OFCONDITIONING.TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE, THAT IS, SET WITHINA DISTINCT FORM AS APART FROM “THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” STYLE. ON THE CONTRARY, IHOPE TO FREE MY FOLLOWERS FROM STYLES. AS I’VE MENTIONED, STYLES “SET” AND“TRAP” REALITY INTO A CHOICE MOLD. FREEDOM JUST CANNOT BE PRECONCEIVED, ANDWHERE THERE IS FREEDOM, THERE IS NEITHER GOOD NOR ITS REACTION BAD. MY ONLYCONCERNS ARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONDITIONED AND SOLIDIFIED BY A PARTIALIZEDSTRUCTURE, WHO GAIN ONLY ROUTINE EFFICIENCY, RATHER THAN FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUALEXPRESSION.JEET KUNE DO DOES NOT LOOK AT COMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUT FROM ALL POSSIBLEANGLES. IT UTILIZES ALL WAYS AND MEANS TO SERVE ITS END, BUT, AND THAT IS A VERYIMPORTANT “BUT,” IT IS BOUND BY NONE; IN OTHER WORDS, JKD, THOUGH POSSESSED OFALL ANGLES, IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ANYSTRUCTURE, HOWEVER INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED, BECOMES A CAGE IF THE PRACTITIONER ISOBSESSED WITH IT. THIS IS WHERE THE VALUE LIES: THE FREEDOM BOTH TO USETECHNIQUES AND TO DISPENSE WITH THEM. THEREFORE, TO DEFINE JKD AS A PARTICULARSYSTEM (GUNG FU, KARATE, AND SO FORTH) IS TO MISS IT COMPLETELY. IT IS OUTSIDEOF ALL PARTICULAR STRUCTURES AND DISTINCT FORMS. HOWEVER, DO NOT MISTAKE JKD FORA COMPOSITE STYLE OR BEING NEUTRAL OR INDIFFERENT; FOR IT IS BOTH AT ONCE “THIS”AND “NOT THIS.” IT IS NEITHER OPPOSED TO STYLES NOR NOT OPPOSED TO THEM. TOUNDERSTAND ONE MUST TRANSCEND THE DUALITY OF “FOR” AND “AGAINST” INTO ONEORGANIC WHOLE. A GOOD JKD MAN RESTS IN DIRECT INTUITION.TRUTH IS A PATHLESS ROAD. IT IS TOTAL EXPRESSION THAT HAS NO BEFORE OR AFTER.SIMILARLY, JKD IS NOT AN ORGANIZED INSTITUTION THAT ONE CAN BE A MEMBER OF.EITHER YOU UNDERSTAND OR YOU DON’T, AND THAT IS THAT. (THERE WAS A JUN FAN GUNGFU INSTITUTE, THERE WAS A METHOD OF WING CHUN, BUT THERE IS NO SUCH ORGANIZATIONOR METHOD EXISTING NOW.)SECONDHAND ARTISTIN MOST CASES, A PRACTITIONER OF THE MARTIAL ART IS WHAT I TERM AS A SECONDHANDARTIST, A CONFORMER. TO BE SURE, HE SELDOM LEARNS TO DEPEND UPON HIMSELF FOREXPRESSION; RATHER, HE FAITHFULLY FOLLOWS A PATTERN. AS TIME PASSES, HE WILLPROBABLY UNDERSTAND SOME DEAD ROUTINES AND BE GOOD ACCORDING TO HIS PARTICULARLYSET PATTERN, BUT HE HAS NOT COME TO UNDERSTAND HIMSELF. DRILLING ON ROUTINES ANDSET PATTERNS WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE A PERSON GOOD ACCORDING TO THE ROUTINES ANDSET PATTERNS, BUT ONLY SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-EXPRESSION CAN LEAD TO THE TRUTH.A LIVE PERSON IS NOT A DEAD PRODUCT OF “THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” STYLE; HE IS ANINDIVIDUAL, AND THE INDIVIDUAL IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SYSTEM.IN MARTIAL ART, MANY INSTRUCTORS DERIVE THEIR TECHNIQUES AND PRINCIPLES FROMINTELLECTUAL THEORIES AND NOT FROM APPLICATION. HE CAN TALK ABOUT COMBAT, ANDTHERE ARE SOME MASTER TALKERS, BUT HE CANNOT REALLY TEACH IT. HE MIGHT CREATETHIS FIRST LAW AND THAT KICKING PRINCIPLE, BUT THE STUDENT WILL MERELY BECONDITIONED AND CONTROLLED RATHER THAN FREEING HIMSELF TO BLOSSOM INTO A BETTERMARTIAL ARTIST. INDEED, IT IS THE “MOLD” AND “SYSTEM” THAT LIMITS AND INTERFERESWITH REALITY.AS IN ANY SPORT, WE WERE TOLD THAT FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO A MARTIAL ARTIST COULDLEAP TO A ROOF—BY WHAT MEANS, CHECK INTO THE SCIENTIFIC APPLICATION OF HIGHJUMPING IN THE OLYMPICS—BUT OF THIS I AM CERTAIN: SUPERIOR PERFORMANCES INMARTIAL ART WILL REST IN FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND NOT ON MANY OF THE OBSOLETE ANDOUTMODED TRAINING METHODS THAT EXIST.AN EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR IS AN EXCELLENT ATHLETE. TRUE, I AM SURE AS A PERSONADVANCES IN AGE HE WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH A GOOD YOUNG MAN, BUT HE HASNO EXCUSE NOT TO BE A FIRST-RATE MAN AMONG HIS CONTEMPORARIES, PHYSICALLY ASWELL AS MENTALLY. AN UNFIT AND INACTIVE INSTRUCTOR MIGHT BE OF SOME HELP TO THEMEDIOCRE STUDENT, BUT HE CAN NEVER TRULY UNDERSTAND.JUST AS ONE CANNOT GET A PIECE OF PAPER TO WRAP AND SHAPE UP WATER, FIGHTING CANNEVER BE MADE TO CONFORM TO ANY ONE SYSTEM, ESPECIALLY FORCING IT INTO A HIGHLYCLASSICAL FRAME. SUCH A FRAME ONLY KILLS AND LIMITS THE LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUALAS WELL AS THE SITUATION. THE PROFESSED CURE FOR SUCH A FRAME IS ITSELF ADISEASE. IN THE PRACTICE OF JKD, THERE IS NO SET OR FORM, FOR JKD IS NOT AMETHOD OF CLASSIFIED TECHNIQUES, LAWS, AND SO FORTH, THAT CONSTITUTE A SYSTEM OFFIGHTING. IT DOES EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO TRAINING, BUT NEVER A METHODOF FIGHTING. TO GO FURTHER, JKD IS A PROCESS, NOT A GOAL; A MEANS BUT NOT ANEND; A CONSTANT MOVEMENT RATHER THAN AN ESTABLISHED, STATIC PATTERN.THE FINAL AIM OF JKD IS TOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION. IT POINTS THE WAY TOINDIVIDUAL FREEDOM AND MATURITY. MECHANICAL EFFICIENCY OR MANIPULATORY SKILL ISNEVER AS IMPORTANT AS INWARD AWARENESS GAINED, FOR TO LEARN A MOVEMENT WITHOUTINWARD AWARENESS RESULTS IN IMITATIVE REPETITIOUSNESS, A MERE PRODUCT. A TRUEFIGHTER “LISTENS” TO CIRCUMSTANCES, WHILE A CLASSICAL MAN “RECITES” HISCIRCUMSTANCES. REMEMBER THAT A MARTIAL ART MAN IS NOT MERELY A PHYSICAL EXPONENTOF SOME PROWESS HE MAY HAVE BEEN GIFTED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE. AS HE MATURES,HE WILL REALIZE THAT HIS SIDE KICK IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH A TOOL TO CONQUER HISOPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGH HIS EGO AND ALL ITS FOLLIES. ALL THATTRAINING IS TO ROUND HIM UP TO BE A COMPLETE MAN.[../Images/172a.jpg][../Images/173a.jpg]IN ESSENCE, THEN, JKD SEEKS TO RESTORE THE PUPIL TO HIS PRIMORDIAL STATE SO THATHE CAN “FREELY” EXPRESS HIS OWN POTENTIAL. THE TRAINING CONSISTS OF A MINIMUM OFFORM IN THE NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF HIS TOOLS TOWARD THE FORMLESS. IN SHORT, THEIDEA IS TO BE ABLE TO ENTER A MOLD YET NOT BE CAGED IN IT, OR TO OBEY THEPRINCIPLES WITHOUT BEING BOUND BY THEM. THIS IS IMPORTANT, FOR A PLIABLE,CHOICELESS OBSERVATION WITHOUT EXCLUSION IS THE FOUNDATION OF A JKD MAN. AN“ALTOGETHER ALERT AWARENESS” WITHOUT A CENTER OR ITS CIRCUMFERENCE; TO BE IN IT,BUT NOT OF IT.IN CLOSING, A JKD MEMBER WHO SAYS JKD IS EXCLUSIVELY JKD IS SIMPLY NOT IN WITHIT. HE IS STILL HUNG UP IN HIS SELF-CLOSING RESISTANCE; IN THIS CASE, ANCHOREDDOWN TO A REACTIONARY PATTERN. HE IS NATURALLY STILL BOUND BY ANOTHER MODIFIEDPATTERN AND CAN MOVE ONLY WITHIN ITS LIMITS. HE HAS NOT DIGESTED THE SIMPLE FACTTHAT TRUTH EXISTS OUTSIDE OF ALL MOLDS AND PATTERNS, AND AWARENESS IS NEVEREXCLUSIVE. JEET KUNE DO IS MERELY A NAME USED, A BOAT TO GET ONE ACROSS THERIVER, AND, ONCE ACROSS, IT IS TO BE DISCARDED, AND NOT TO BE CARRIED ON ONE’SBACK.

PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE FINGER TO BE THEMOON.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S ESSAY ENTITLED “JKD,” CIRCA 1971. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.5-ITOWARD PERSONAL LIBERATION (JKD: VIII)THE USEFULNESS OF A CUP IS IN ITS EMPTINESS, AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF AMARTIAL ARTIST WHO HAS NO FORM AND IS THEREFORE DEVOID OF “STYLE” BECAUSE HE HASNO PRECONCEIVED PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO COMBAT—NO LIKES OR DISLIKES. AS ARESULT, HE IS FLUID, ADAPTABLE, AND CAPABLE OF TRANSCENDING DUALITY INTO ONEULTIMATE TOTALITY.[../Images/174a.jpg]I HOPE YOU WILL BE LIKE THE TEA CUP AND JOIN ME IN THIS BRIEF TALK TOGETHER, ANDDO VENTURE WITH ME LIGHTLY; THAT IS, LEAVE ALL THE BURDENS OF PRECONCEIVEDOPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS BEHIND. ON THE OTHER HAND, DO RELATE TO WHAT IS BEINGSAID TO YOU BECAUSE IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE BLOSSOMING OF A MARTIAL ARTIST, QUAMARTIAL ARTIST, AND NOT “A CHINESE MARTIAL ARTIST,” A “JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTIST,”A “KOREAN MARTIAL ARTIST” OR AN “AMERICAN MARTIAL ARTIST,” AND SO FORTH. AMARTIAL ARTIST IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A HUMAN BEING, AFTER ALL, WHICH INCLUDESALL OF US. NATIONALITIES, PER SE, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PROFICIENCY IN MARTIALART.LET US IMAGINE THAT SEVERAL PERSONS WHO ARE TRAINED IN DIFFERENT COMBATIVE ARTSHAVE JUST WITNESSED A FIGHT. IT IS CERTAIN THAT EACH OF THEM WOULD RELATE ADIFFERENT ACCOUNT OF IT AFTERWARD. THIS IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE, OWING TO THEFACT THAT ONE CANNOT SEE A FIGHT “AS IS” SINCE IT WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THERESPECTIVE FILTERS OF A BOXER, A WRESTLER, A KARATE-KA, A JUDO-KA, OR ANYONE WHOIS TRAINED IN A PARTICULAR METHOD BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE THE FIGHT ACCORDING TOTHE LIMITS OF THEIR PARTICULAR CONDITIONING. EVERY ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE FIGHTIS REALLY AN INTELLECTUAL REACTION, A PARTIALIZED IDEA OF THE TOTAL FIGHT; INTHIS CASE, DEPENDING ON ONE’S LIKES AND DISLIKES. HOWEVER, IN REALITY, THE FIGHTITSELF WAS NOT SOMETHING DICTATED BY YOUR CONDITIONING AS A KOREAN MARTIALARTIST, A CHINESE MARTIAL ARTIST, OR WHATEVER YOUR STYLE MIGHT HAPPEN TO BE.TRUE OBSERVATION BEGINS WHEN ONE IS DEVOID OF SET PATTERNS, AND FREEDOM OFEXPRESSION OCCURS WHEN ONE IS BEYOND SYSTEMS.[../Images/175a.jpg]A PERSON CANNOT EXPRESS HIMSELF FULLY AND TOTALLY WHEN A PARTIAL SET STRUCTUREOR STYLE IS IMPOSED UPON HIM. COMBAT “AS IS” IS TOTAL (INCLUDING ALL “THAT IS”AS WELL AS “THAT IS NOT”), WITHOUT FAVORITE LINES OR ANGLES, HAVING NOBOUNDARIES AND ALWAYS FRESH AND ALIVE; IT IS NEVER SET AND IS CONSTANTLYCHANGING. COMBAT DEFINITELY MUST NOT BE LIMITED TO YOUR PERSONAL INCLINATION,YOUR PHYSICAL MAKEUP, OR YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING—ALTHOUGH THESE ARE ALSOPARTS OF THE TOTALITY OF COMBAT. SHOULD THERE BE ANY CONFINEMENT OF ANY SORT,THAT IS, PUTTING COMBAT INTO A CHOSEN MOLD, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A RESISTANCE OFONE’S SET PATTERN OF “WHAT SHOULD BE” AS OPPOSED TO THE EVER-CHANGING “WHAT IS.”TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT, I HAVE NOT INVENTED A NEW STYLE, A COMPOSITE,MODIFIED OR OTHERWISE, THAT IS, SET WITHIN A DISTINCT FORM AND LAWS AS APARTFROM “THIS” STYLE OR “THAT” METHOD. ON THE CONTRARY, I HOPE TO FREE MY FOLLOWERSFROM CLINGING TO STYLES, PATTERNS, OR MOLDS. SO DO REMEMBER THAT THE TERM JEETKUNE DO IS MERELY A NAME USED, A MIRROR IN WHICH WE SEE OURSELVES. THE NAMEBRAND IS NOTHING SPECIAL.JUST WHAT IS A CLASSICAL STYLE OF MARTIAL ART? FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE MUSTREALIZE THE FACT THAT MAN CREATED STYLES. DISREGARD THE MANY FANCY HISTORICALORIGINS OF THEIR FOUNDERS (FOR EXAMPLE, BY A “WISE ANCIENT MONK,” BY “SPECIALMESSENGER IN A DREAM,” IN A “HOLY REVELATION,” AND SO FORTH): A STYLE SHOULDNEVER BE THE GOSPEL TRUTH, THE LAWS AND PRINCIPLES OF WHICH CAN NEVER BEVIOLATED. MAN, THE HUMAN BEING, IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANY STYLE.THE FOUNDER OF A STYLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME PARTIAL TRUTH, BUT ASTIME PASSED BY, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PASSING AWAY OF THE FOUNDER, THIS PARTIALTRUTH BECAME A LAW OR, WORSE STILL, A PREJUDICED FAITH AGAINST THE “DIFFERENT”SECTS. IN ORDER TO PASS ALONG THIS KNOWLEDGE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION, THEVARIOUS RESPONSES HAD TO BE ORGANIZED AND CLASSIFIED AND PRESENTED IN A LOGICALORDER. SO WHAT MIGHT HAVE STARTED OFF AS SOME SORT OF PERSONAL FLUIDITY ON THEPART OF ITS FOUNDER IS NOW SOLIDIFIED KNOWLEDGE, A PRESERVED CURE-ALL FOR MASSCONDITIONING.IN THE PROCESS THE FOLLOWERS HAVE MADE THIS KNOWLEDGE NOT ONLY A HOLY SHRINE,BUT A TOMB IN WHICH THE FOUNDER’S WISDOM IS BURIED. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OFORGANIZATION AND PRESERVATION, THE MEANS WOULD BECOME SO ELABORATED THATTREMENDOUS ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THEM, AND GRADUALLY THE END IS FORGOTTEN.THE FOLLOWERS WILL THEN ACCEPT THIS “ORGANIZED SOMETHING” AS THE TOTAL REALITYOF COMBAT. OF COURSE, MANY MORE “DIFFERENT” APPROACHES WOULD SPRING UP, PROBABLYAS A DIRECT REACTION TO “THE OTHER’S TRUTH.” PRETTY SOON THESE APPROACHES TOOWOULD BECOME LARGE ORGANIZATIONS WITH EACH CLAIMING TO POSSESS “TRUTH” TO THEEXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER STYLES. MORE AND MORE THE STYLE BECOMES MORE IMPORTANTTHAN ITS PRACTITIONER.THE PROFESSED CURE OF A CLASSICAL STYLE IS ITSELF A DISEASE. A STYLE HAS THETENDENCY TO “SET” AND “TRAP” REALITY INTO A PRESELECTED MOLD. MAYBE BECAUSE ONEDOES NOT WANT TO BE LEFT UNCERTAIN OR INSECURE HE “ORGANIZES” A CHOSEN PATTERNOF COMBAT. DISREGARD THE CAUSE; ITS FOLLOWERS ARE BEING ENCLOSED AND CONTROLLEDWITHIN THE STYLE’S LIMITATION, WHICH CERTAINLY LIMITS THEIR OWN POTENTIAL. LIKEANYTHING ELSE, PROLONGED IMITATIVE DRILLING WILL PROMOTE MECHANICAL PRECISION;HOWEVER, THE MARGIN OF FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION GROWS NARROWER AND NARROWER. SO ONECAN FOLLOW FORMULAS BY “KEEPING HIS ELBOWS IN,” “SINKING HIS SPIRIT DOWN,”“BEING THIS,” OR “BEING THAT,” BUT IN THE LONG RUN, HE WILL JUST BE MOLDEDACCORDING TO SOMEONE ELSE’S FANCY. REMEMBER, THE WHOLE IS EVIDENCED IN ALL THEPARTS, BUT AN ISOLATED PART, EFFICIENT OR NOT, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE THE WHOLE. SOONE CAN SAY “A LITTLE LEARNING IS A DANGEROUS THING” APPLIES APPROPRIATELY TOTHOSE WHO ARE CONDITIONED TO A PARTICULAR APPROACH TO COMBAT.IF MERE MECHANICAL ROUTINE EFFICIENCY COULD MAKE EVERYONE A MARTIAL ARTIST, THENALL WOULD BE WELL. UNFORTUNATELY, COMBAT, LIKE FREEDOM, IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOTBE PRECONCEIVED. PREFORMATIONS SIMPLY LACK THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO THE EVERCHANGING. AT THIS POINT, MANY WOULD ASK HOW THEN DO WE GAIN THIS UNLIMITEDFREEDOM? I CANNOT TELL YOU, BECAUSE IT WILL THEN BECOME AN APPROACH. ALTHOUGH ICAN TELL YOU WHAT IT IS NOT, I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT IT IS. “THAT,” MY FRIEND,YOU WILL HAVE TO FIND OUT ALL BY YOURSELF, FOR THERE IS NO HELP BUT SELF-HELP.WHAT IS MORE, WHO SAYS WE HAVE TO “GAIN” FREEDOM?IN TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ART, BEING WISE SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT PROCESS OFACCUMULATING FIXED KNOWLEDGE—LIKE A FIRST DEGREE BLACK BELT KNOWS SO MANY SETSOR TECHNIQUES, A SECOND DEGREE A LITTLE MORE; OR AN X BRAND MARTIAL ARTIST, AKICKER, SHOULD ACCUMULATE Y BRAND’S HAND TECHNIQUES, OR VICE VERSA. ACCUMULATINGFIXED KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE PROCESS OF JKD; RATHER, IT IS THAT OF DISCOVERING THECAUSE OF IGNORANCE, AND OFTENTIMES IT INVOLVES A SHEDDING PROCESS. REMEMBER MYFRIENDS THAT ULTIMATELY, KNOWLEDGE IN MARTIAL ART SIMPLY MEANS SELF-KNOWLEDGE,AND JKD CAN BECOME INTELLIGIBLE ONLY IN THE PROCESS OF SELF-DISCOVERY.FREEDOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US, AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE GAINED AT THE ENDTHROUGH FOLLOWING SOME PARTICULAR FORMULAS. WE DO NOT “BECOME,” WE SIMPLY “ARE.”SO THE TRAINING IN JKD IS TOWARD THIS: “BEING” MIND, RATHER THAN “HAVING” MIND.STERILE PATTERNS ARE INCAPABLE OF SUCH LIVELINESS AND FRESHNESS, ANDPREFORMATIONS ONLY SQUELCH CREATIVITY AND IMPOSE MEDIOCRITY. ALSO, THE MYSTICALMIND TRAINING PROMOTES NOT THE PROMISED INTERNAL POWER BUT PSYCHOLOGICALCONSTIPATION. IN JKD, WHETHER IT IS INWARD OR OUTWARD TRAINING, THE TECHNIQUESUSED ARE OFTEN TEMPORARY EXPEDIENTS, THE AIM BEING TO LIBERATE THE SPIRIT RATHERTHAN TO BIND THE BODY.UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH, THERE IS NEVER A SERIES OF RULES, ACLASSIFICATION OF TECHNIQUES, AND SO FORTH, WHICH CONSTITUTE A SO-CALLED JKDMETHOD OF FIGHTING. TO BEGIN WITH, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A METHOD OFFIGHTING. TO CREATE SUCH A METHOD IS PRETTY MUCH LIKE TRYING TO CONTAIN ANDSHAPE A POUND OF WATER IN WRAPPING PAPER (AND THEN ATTEMPTING TO ARGUE WHICH ISTHE “BEST” COLOR OR TEXTURE OF THE WRAPPING PAPER).BRIEFLY, JKD IS NOT A FORM OF SPECIAL CONDITIONING WITH A SET OF BELIEFS AND APARTICULAR APPROACH. SO BASICALLY IT IS NOT A “MASS” ART. IT DOES NOT LOOK ATCOMBAT FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUT FROM ALL POSSIBLE ANGLES BECAUSE IT IS NOT BASEDON ANY SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH IT UTILIZES ALL WAYS AND MEANS TO SERVE ITS END(EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THAT SCORES), IT IS BOUND BY NONE, AND IT IS THEREFOREFREE FROM THESE WAYS AND MEANS. IN OTHER WORDS, JKD, THOUGH POSSESSED OF ALLANGLES, IS ITSELF NOT POSSESSED; FOR ANY STRUCTURE, HOWEVER EFFICIENTLYDESIGNED, BECOMES A CAGE IF THE PRACTITIONER IS OBSESSED WITH IT.TO DEFINE JKD AS A STYLE (THAT IS, GUNG FU, KARATE, KICKBOXING, AND SO FORTH) ISTO MISS THE POINT COMPLETELY. IF JKD IS NOT A STYLE OR A METHOD, MAYBE IT ISBEING NEUTRAL OR MAYBE IT IS INDIFFERENCE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE CASE EITHER,FOR JKD IS BOTH AT ONCE “THIS” AND “NOT THIS,” AND JKD IS NEITHER OPPOSED TOSTYLES NOR NOT OPPOSED TO THEM. TO UNDERSTAND FULLY, ONE MUST TRANSCEND THEDUALITY OF “FOR” AND “AGAINST” INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE. WITHIN THE ABSOLUTE THEREIS SIMPLY NO DISTINCTION; EVERYTHING IS. A GOOD JKD ARTIST RESTS IN DIRECTINTUITION.[../Images/178a.jpg]WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES I WAS TEACHING MY VERSION OF WINGCHUN—I HAD MY “CHINESE” SYSTEM THEN. HOWEVER, SINCE THEN I NO LONGER AMINTERESTED IN SYSTEMS OR ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZED INSTITUTES TEND TO PRODUCEPATTERNIZED PRISONERS OF A SYSTEMATIZED CONCEPT, AND THE INSTRUCTORS ARE OFTENFIXED IN A ROUTINE. OF COURSE, WHAT IS WORSE IS THAT FORCING THE MEMBERS TO FITA LIFELESS PRE-FORMATION BLOCKS THEIR NATURAL GROWTH. A TEACHER, A GOOD TEACHERTHAT IS, FUNCTIONS AS A POINTER TO TRUTH, BUT NOT A GIVER OF TRUTH. HE EMPLOYS AMINIMUM OF FORM TO LEAD HIS STUDENT TO THE FORMLESS. FURTHERMORE, HE POINTS OUTTHE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO ENTER A MOLD WITHOUT BEING IMPRISONED BY IT; ORTO FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES WITHOUT BEING BOUND BY THEM.[../Images/179a.jpg]A PLIABLE, CHOICELESS OBSERVATION WITHOUT EXCLUSION IS SO ESSENTIAL IN JKD, ORMARTIAL ART, AN “ALTOGETHER ALERT AWARENESS” WITHOUT ITS CENTER OR ITSCIRCUMFERENCE; TO BE IN IT, BUT NOT OF IT. ABOVE ALL, I BELIEVE A TEACHER DOESNOT DEPEND ON A METHOD AND DRILL SYSTEMATIC ROUTINES; INSTEAD, HE STUDIES EACHINDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND AWAKENS HIM TO EXPLORE HIMSELF, BOTH INTERNALLY ANDEXTERNALLY, AND ULTIMATELY INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH HIS BEING. SUCH TEACHING,WHICH IS REALLY NO TEACHING, REQUIRES A SENSITIVE MIND WITH GREAT FLEXIBILITY,AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY NOWADAYS.SINCERE AND SERIOUS LEARNERS ARE EQUALLY DIFFICULT TO COME BY. MANY OF THEM AREFIVE-MINUTE ENTHUSIASTS, SOME OF THEM COME IN WITH ILL INTENTIONS, BUTUNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THEM ARE SECONDHAND ARTISTS, BASICALLY CONFORMERS. THESECOND-HAND ARTIST SELDOM LEARNS TO DEPEND UPON HIMSELF FOR EXPRESSION; INSTEAD,HE FAITHFULLY FOLLOWS AN IMPOSED PATTERN. SO WHAT IS NURTURED IS THE DEPENDENTMIND RATHER THAN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY. AS TIME GOES BY HE MIGHT UNDERSTAND SOMEROUTINES AND MIGHT EVEN BE SKILLFUL ACCORDING TO A PARTICULAR PATTERN. HOWEVER,HE HAS GAINED CONTROL OF MANIPULATIVE SKILL, BUT HE HAS NOT GAINED ANUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HE IS IN HIMSELF.MARTIAL ART IS NOT MERELY THE PHYSICAL ACT OF FILLING TIME AND SPACE WITHPRECISION-LIKE MOVEMENTS. MACHINES CAN DO THAT, TOO. AS HE MATURES, A MARTIALARTIST WILL REALIZE THAT HIS KICK OR PUNCH IS REALLY NOT SO MUCH A TOOL TOCONQUER HIS OPPONENT, BUT A TOOL TO EXPLODE THROUGH HIS CONSCIOUSNESS, HIS EGO,AND ALL MENTAL OBSTACLES. INDEED, THE TOOLS ARE ULTIMATELY A MEANS FORPENETRATING THE DEPTH OF HIS BEING SO THAT HE WILL RESTORE THE EQUILIBRIUM OFHIS INNER CENTER OF GRAVITY. WITH THIS VITAL INWARD LOOSENING FLOWS HIS OUTWARDEXPRESSION OF HIS TOOLS. BEHIND EACH PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF AN ACCOMPLISHEDMARTIAL ARTIST IS THIS WHOLENESS OF BEING, THIS ALL-INCLUSIVE ATTITUDE.HOW OFTEN WE ARE TOLD BY DIFFERENT “MASTERS” AND “PROFESSORS” (AND IT WOULD SEEMTHAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF PHILOSOPHICAL AND SOMETIMES SCHOLASTIC PROFESSORSAROUND) THAT MARTIAL ART IS “LIFE ITSELF.” I WONDER HOW MANY OF THEM REALLYAPPRECIATE THAT STATEMENT AND TRULY UNDERSTAND. TO BE SURE, LIFE DOES NOT MEAN APARTIALIZED SOMETHING, A FRAME. LIFE IS NEVER STAGNATION. IT IS A CONSTANTMOVEMENT, UNRHYTHMIC MOVEMENT, AS WELL AS CONSTANT CHANGE. INSTEAD OF FLOWINGWITH THIS CHANGE WITHOUT PREJUDICE, MANY OF THE MARTIAL ART “MASTERS”— PAST ANDPRESENT—HAVE BUILT AN ILLUSION OF FIXED FORMS, SOLIDIFYING THE EVER FLOWING,DISSECTING THE TOTALITY, ORGANIZING SELECT PATTERNS, PLANNING SPONTANEITY,SEPARATING THE HARMONIOUS UNITY INTO DUALITY OF THE SOFT VERSUS THE FIRM,GRAPPLING VERSUS LONG RANGE, AND SO FORTH.THE RESULT OF THIS IS QUITE EVIDENT TODAY; WE NOW HAVE MANY, MANY INSENSITIVE,PATTERNIZED ROBOTS AROUND LISTENING TO THEIR OWN SCREAMS AND SPIRITUAL YELLS.THEY ARE MERELY PERFORMING THEIR METHODICAL ROUTINES AS POTENTIAL RESPONSESRATHER THAN RESPONDING TO “WHAT IS.” THEY NO LONGER LISTEN TO CIRCUMSTANCES;THEY “RECITE THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES.” THESE POOR SOULS HAVE BECOME THOSE ORGANIZEDFORMS, THEY ARE THOSE CLASSICAL BLOCKS; IN SHORT, THEY ARE THE “PRODUCT” OFCONDITIONING HANDED DOWN HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.OFTEN THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHETHER JKD IS AGAINST FORMS. IT IS TRUE THAT THEREARE NO PREARRANGED SETS OR KATA IN JKD. HOWEVER, IN ANY PHYSICAL MOVEMENT THEREIS ALWAYS A MOST EFFICIENT AND ALIVE MANNER FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL TO ACCOMPLISHTHE PURPOSE OF THE PERFORMANCE, THAT IS, IN REGARD TO PROPER LEVERAGE, BALANCEIN MOVEMENT, ECONOMICAL AND EFFICIENT USE OF MOTION AND ENERGY, AND SO FORTH.LIVE, EFFICIENT MOVEMENT THAT LIBERATES IS ONE THING; STERILE CLASSICAL SETSTHAT BIND AND CONDITION ARE ANOTHER. ALSO THERE IS A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN“HAVING NO FORM” AND HAVING “NO-FORM”; THE FIRST IS IGNORANCE, THE SECONDTRANSCENDENCE.[../Images/181a.jpg]THERE IS NO STANDARD IN TOTAL COMBAT, AND EXPRESSION MUST BE FREE. THISLIBERATING TRUTH BECOMES REALITY ONLY IN PROPORTION TO ITS BEING EXPERIENCED ANDLIVED IN ITS SUCHNESS BY THE INDIVIDUAL HIMSELF. AND THIS TRUTH IS FAR BEYONDSTYLES OR DISCIPLINES.REMEMBER TOO THAT JKD IS JUST A NAME USED, A VEHICLE TO CARRY YOU OVEROBSTACLES, LIKE A BOAT USED TO GET ONE ACROSS A RIVER. ONCE ACROSS, THE BOAT ISTO BE DISCARDED, NOT CARRIED ON ONE’S BACK. THESE FEW PARAGRAPHS ARE, AT BEST,MERELY “A FINGER POINTING TO THE MOON.” PLEASE DO NOT FOCUS ON THE FINGER OR YOUWILL NOT SEE THE MOON, AND THUS YOU WILL MISS ALL THE HEAVENLY GLORY. AFTER ALL,THE USEFULNESS OF THE FINGER IS IN “POINTING AWAY FROM ITSELF TO THE LIGHT WHICHILLUMINATES FINGER AND ALL.”SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S TYPED ESSAY ENTITLED “JEET KUNE DO—TOWARD PERSONALLIBERATION,” PLUS BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE ENTITLED “A ZEN STORY OF TEASERVING,” BOTH CIRCA 1971.

BRUCE LEE PAPERS.5-KMORE NOTES ON JEET KUNE DOFREEDOM IS SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE PRECONCEIVED. TO REALIZE FREEDOM REQUIRES ANALERT MIND, A MIND THAT IS DEEP WITH ENERGY, A MIND THAT IS CAPABLE OF IMMEDIATEPERCEPTION WITHOUT THE PROCESS OF GRADUATION, WITHOUT THE IDEA OF AN END TO BESLOWLY ACHIEVED.THE MARGIN OF FREEDOM FOR THE CLASSICAL PRACTITIONER IS GETTING NARROWER ALL THETIME.[../Images/184a.jpg]THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION, NO DEMAND FOR A PATTERN OF ACTION IN UNDERSTANDING.YOU ARE MERELY OBSERVING—JUST LOOK AT IT AND WATCH IT. THE PERCEIVING MIND ISLIVING, MOVING, FULL OF ENERGY, AND ONLY SUCH A MIND CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT TRUTHIS.CLASSICAL METHODS AND TRADITION MAKE THE MIND A SLAVE—YOU ARE NO LONGER ANINDIVIDUAL, BUT MERELY A PRODUCT. YOUR MIND IS THE RESULT OF A THOUSANDYESTERDAYS.LIFE IS WIDE, LIMITLESS—THERE IS NO BORDER, NO FRONTIER.NOT CONVICTION, NOT METHOD, BUT PERCEPTION IS THE WAY OF TRUTH. IT IS A STATE OFEFFORTLESS AWARENESS, PLIABLE AWARENESS, CHOICELESS AWARENESS.THE MOMENT YOU HAVE A CENTER, THERE MUST ALSO BE A CIRCUMFERENCE; AND TOFUNCTION FROM A CENTER, WITHIN A CIRCUMFERENCE, IS SLAVERY.IT IS AN “ALTOGETHER” FEELING, WITHOUT A CENTER.WIPE AWAY AND DISSOLVE ALL EXPERIENCE AND BE “BORN AFRESH.”WHEN YOU LISTEN FURTHER TO SOMETHING, YOU HAVE CEASED TO LISTEN. KNOWING IS ACONSTANT MOVEMENT; THEREFORE THERE IS NO STATIC STATE, NO FIXED POINT FROM WHICHTO ACT. KNOWLEDGE IS BINDING, BUT THE MOVEMENT OF KNOWING IS NOT BINDING.LIFE IS SOMETHING FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ANSWER; IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD FROMMOMENT TO MOMENT. THE ANSWER WE FIND INEVITABLY CONFORMS TO THE PATTERN OF WHATWE THINK WE KNOW.SIMPLICITY IS AN INWARD STATE OF BEING IN WHICH THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION, NOCOMPARISON; IT IS THE QUALITY OF PERCEPTION IN APPROACHING ANY PROBLEM. IT ISNOT SIMPLY WHEN THE MIND APPROACHES ANY PROBLEM WITH A FIXED IDEA OR BELIEF, ORWITH A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF THOUGHT.A SIMPLE MIND, SURELY, IS ONE THAT FUNCTIONS, THAT THINKS AND FEELS WITHOUT AMOTIVE. WHERE THERE IS A MOTIVE, THERE MUST BE A WAY, A METHOD, A SYSTEM OFDISCIPLINE. THE MOTIVE IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE DESIRE FOR AN END, FOR A GOAL,AND TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL, THERE MUST BE A WAY, AND SO FORTH. MEDITATION IS AFREEING OF THE MIND FROM ALL MOTIVES.BECAUSE ONE DOES NOT WANT TO BE DISTURBED, TO BE MADE UNCERTAIN, HE ESTABLISHESA PATTERN OF CONDUCT, OF THOUGHT, A PATTERN OF RELATIONSHIP TO MAN, AND SOFORTH. THEN HE BECOMES A SLAVE TO THE PATTERN AND TAKES THE PATTERN TO BE THEREAL THING.ANY EFFORT THE MIND MAKES WILL FURTHER LIMIT THE MIND, BECAUSE EFFORT IMPLIESTHE STRUGGLE TOWARD A GOAL; AND WHEN YOU HAVE A GOAL, A PURPOSE, AN END IN VIEW,YOU HAVE PLACED A LIMIT ON THE MIND, AND IT IS WITH SUCH A MIND THAT YOU ARETRYING TO MEDITATE.THIS EVENING I SEE SOMETHING TOTALLY NEW, AND THAT NERVOUSNESS IS EXPERIENCED BYTHE MIND; BUT TOMORROW THAT EXPERIENCE BECOMES MECHANICAL, BECAUSE I WANT TOREPEAT THE SENSATION, THE PLEASURE OF IT. THE DESCRIPTION IS NEVER REAL. WHAT ISREAL IS SEEING THE TRUTH INSTANTANEOUSLY, BECAUSE TRUTH HAS NO FUTURE.OBSERVE WHAT IS WITH UNDIVIDED AWARENESS.MEDITATION, SURELY, CAN NEVER BE A PROCESS OF CONCENTRATION, BECAUSE THE HIGHESTFORM OF THINKING IS NEGATIVE THINKING. NEGATION IS NOT THE OPPOSITE OF THEPOSITIVE, BUT A STATE IN WHICH THERE IS NEITHER THE POSITIVE NOR ITS REACTION ASTHE NEGATIVE. IT IS A STATE OF COMPLETE EMPTINESS.CONCENTRATION IS A FORM OF EXCLUSION; AND WHERE THERE IS EXCLUSION, THERE IS ATHINKER WHO EXCLUDES. IT IS THE THINKER, THE EXCLUDER, THE ONE WHO CONCENTRATES,WHO CREATES CONTRADICTION, BECAUSE THEN THERE IS A CENTER FROM WHICH THERE CANBE A DEVIATION, A DISTRACTION.AWARENESS HAS NO FRONTIER; IT IS A GIVING OF YOUR WHOLE BEING TOWARD SOMETHING,WITHOUT EXCLUSION.CONCENTRATION IS A NARROWING DOWN OF THE MIND—BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THETOTAL PROCESS OF LIVING, AND TO CONCENTRATE EXCLUSIVELY ON ANY PARTICULAR ASPECTOF LIFE BELITTLES LIFE.HOW CAN THERE BE METHODS AND SYSTEMS BY WHICH TO ARRIVE AT SOMETHING THAT ISLIVING? TO THAT WHICH IS STATIC, FIXED, DEAD, THERE CAN BE A WAY, A DEFINITEPATH, BUT NOT TO THAT WHICH IS LIVING. DO NOT REDUCE REALITY TO A STATIC THING,AND THEN INVENT METHODS BY WHICH TO REACH IT.ACCEPTANCE, DENIAL, AND CONVICTION PREVENT UNDERSTANDING. LET YOUR MIND AND THESPEAKER’S MIND MOVE TOGETHER IN UNDERSTANDING, WITH SENSITIVITY; THEN THERE IS APOSSIBILITY OF REAL COMMUNION WITH EACH OTHER. TO UNDERSTAND, SURELY, THERE MUSTBE A STATE OF CHOICELESS AWARENESS IN WHICH THERE IS NO SENSE OF COMPARISON ORCONDEMNATION, NO WAITING FOR A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE THING WE ARE TALKINGABOUT IN ORDER TO AGREE OR DISAGREE. DON’T START FROM A CONCLUSION ABOVE ALL.UNDERSTANDING REQUIRES NOT JUST A MOMENT OF PERCEPTION, BUT A CONTINUOUSAWARENESS, A CONTINUOUS STATE OF INQUIRY IN WHICH THERE IS NO CONCLUSION. THEREIS NO THINKING THAT IS FREE— ALL THOUGHT IS PARTIAL; IT CAN NEVER BE TOTAL.THOUGHT IS THE RESPONSE OF MEMORY, AND MEMORY IS ALWAYS PARTIAL, BECAUSE MEMORYIS THE RESULT OF EXPERIENCE; SO THOUGHT IS THE REACTION OF A MIND WHICH ISCONDITIONED BY EXPERIENCE.KNOWLEDGE, SURELY, IS ALWAYS OF TIME, WHEREAS KNOWING IS NOT OF TIME. KNOWLEDGEIS FROM A SOURCE, FROM AN ACCUMULATION, FROM A CONCLUSION, WHILE KNOWING IS AMOVEMENT.THE ADDITIVE PROCESS IS MERELY A CULTIVATION OF MEMORY, WHICH BECOMESMECHANICAL. LEARNING IS NEVER CUMULATIVE; IT IS A MOVEMENT OF KNOWING THAT HASNO BEGINNING AND NO END.THERE IS AN AWARENESS WITHOUT CHOICE, WITHOUT ANY DEMAND, AN AWARENESS IN WHICHTHERE IS NO ANXIETY; AND IN THAT STATE OF MIND THERE IS PERCEPTION. IT IS THEPERCEPTION ALONE THAT WILL RESOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS.A STATE OF PERCEPTION AND NOTHING ELSE—THAT IS, A STATE OF BEING.ACTION IS OUR RELATIONSHIP TO EVERYTHING.ACTION IS NOT A MATTER OF RIGHT AND WRONG. IT IS ONLY WHEN ACTION IS PARTIAL,NOT TOTAL, THAT THERE IS RIGHT AND WRONG.NOT THE CULTIVATED INNOCENCE OF A CLEVER MIND THAT WANTS TO BE INNOCENT, BUTTHAT STATE OF INNOCENCE IN WHICH THERE IS NO DENIAL OR ACCEPTANCE, AND IN WHICHTHE MIND JUST SEES WHAT IS.WE SHALL FIND THE TRUTH WHEN WE EXAMINE THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS NEVER APARTFROM THE ANSWER; THE PROBLEM IS THE ANSWER—THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM ISTHE DISSOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.WHEN THE MIND IS TETHERED TO A CENTER, NATURALLY IT IS NOT FREE; IT CAN MOVEONLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THAT CENTER.IF ONE IS ISOLATED, HE IS DEAD; HE IS PARALYZED WITHIN THE FORTRESS OF HIS OWNIDEAS.THE MIND MUST BE WIDE OPEN IN ORDER TO FUNCTION FREELY IN THOUGHT. FOR A LIMITEDMIND CANNOT THINK FREELY.A CONCENTRATED MIND IS NOT AN ATTENTIVE MIND, BUT A MIND THAT IS IN THE STATE OFAWARENESS CAN CONCENTRATE.

THE ACT IS SO DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE THAT INTELLECTION FINDS NO ROOM HERETO INSERT ITSELF AND CUT IT TO PIECES.A STRUGGLE OF ANY NATURE CAN NEVER BE SETTLED SATISFACTORILY UNTIL THE ABSOLUTEFACT IS TOUCHED. WHERE NEITHER OPPONENT CAN AFFECT THE OTHER, NOT NEUTRALITY,NOT INDIFFERENCE, BUT TRANSCENDENCE IS THE THING NEEDED.ULTIMATELY JEET KUNE DO IS NOT A MATTER OF TECHNOLOGY, BUT OF SPIRITUAL INSIGHTAND TRAINING.IT IS THE EGO THAT STANDS RIGIDLY AGAINST THINGS COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE, AND ITIS THIS “EGO RIGIDITY” THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING THATCONFRONTS US.ART LIVES WHERE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM IS, BECAUSE WHERE IT IS NOT, THERE CAN BE NOCREATIVITY.TO BE OF NO MIND MEANS THE “EVERYDAY MIND.”BECAUSE YOUR SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS OR EGO-CONSCIOUSNESS IS TOO CONSPICUOUSLYPRESENT OVER THE ENTIRE RANGE OF YOUR ATTENTION—WHICH FACT INTERFERES WITH AFREE DISPLAY OF WHATEVER PROFICIENCY YOU HAVE SO FAR ACQUIRED OR ARE GOING TOACQUIRE. YOU SHOULD GET RID OF THIS OBTRUDING SELF—OR EGO-CONSCIOUSNESS—ANDAPPLY YOURSELF TO THE WORK TO BE DONE AS IF NOTHING PARTICULAR WERE TAKING PLACEAT THE MOMENT.THE WATERS ARE IN MOTION ALL THE TIME, BUT THE MOON RETAINS IT SERENITY. THEMIND MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE TEN THOUSAND SITUATIONS BUT REMAINS EVER THE SAME.THE PRISTINE PURITYIN ORDER TO DISPLAY ITS NATIVE ACTIVITIES TO THE UTMOST LIMIT, REMOVE ALL PHYSICOBSTRUCTION.SHARPEN THE PSYCHIC POWER OF SEEING IN ORDER TO ACT IMMEDIATELY IN ACCORDANCEWITH WHAT THE MIND SEES—THE SEEING TAKES PLACE WITH THE INNER MIND.LEARNING GAINED IS LEARNING LOST.THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL YOU HAVE ACHIEVED ARE AFTER ALL MEANT TO BE “FORGOTTEN”SO YOU CAN FLOAT IN EMPTINESS WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION AND COMFORTABLY. LEARNING ISIMPORTANT, BUT DO NOT BECOME ITS SLAVE. ABOVE ALL, DO NOT HARBOR ANYTHINGEXTERNAL AND SUPERFLUOUS; THE MIND IS THE PRIMARY.YOU CAN NEVER BE THE MASTER OF YOUR TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE UNLESS ALL YOUR PSYCHICHINDRANCES ARE REMOVED AND YOU CAN KEEP THE MIND IN THE STATE OF EMPTINESS(FLUIDITY), EVEN PURGED OF WHATEVER TECHNIQUE YOU HAVE OBTAINED—WITH NOCONSCIOUS EFFORT.WITH ALL THE TRAINING THROWN TO THE WIND, WITH A MIND PERFECTLY UNAWARE OF ITSOWN WORKINGS, WITH THE SELF VANISHING NOWHERE ANYBODY KNOWS, THE ART OF JEETKUNE DO ATTAINS PERFECTION.LEARNING THE TECHNIQUES CORRESPONDS TO AN INTELLECTUAL APPREHENSION IN ZEN OFITS PHILOSOPHY, AND IN BOTH ZEN AND JEET KUNE DO A PROFICIENCY IN THIS DOES NOTCOVER THE WHOLE GROUND OF THE DISCIPLINE. BOTH REQUIRE US TO COME TO THEATTAINMENT OF ULTIMATE REALITY, WHICH IS THE EMPTINESS OR THE ABSOLUTE. THELATTER TRANSCENDS ALL MODES OF RELATIVITY. IN JEET KUNE DO, ALL THE TECHNIQUE ISTO BE FORGOTTEN, AND THE UNCONSCIOUS IS TO BE LEFT ALONE TO HANDLE THESITUATION—WHEN THE TECHNIQUE WILL ASSURE ITS WONDERS AUTOMATICALLY ORSPONTANEOUSLY—TO FLOAT IN TOTALITY. TO HAVE NO TECHNIQUE IS TO HAVE ALLTECHNIQUE.ANY TECHNIQUE, HOWEVER WORTHY AND DESIRABLE, BECOMES A DISEASE WHEN THE MIND ISOBSESSED WITH IT.THE SIX DISEASES> 1. THE DESIRE FOR VICTORY> > 2.

THE DESIRE TO GET RID OF WHATEVER DISEASE YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE INFECTED> WITH“TO DESIRE” IS AN ATTACHMENT. “TO DESIRE NOT TO DESIRE” IS ALSO AN ATTACHMENT.TO BE UNATTACHED, THEN, MEANS TO BE FREE AT ONCE FROM BOTH STATEMENTS, POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS TO BE SIMULTANEOUSLY BOTH “YES” AND “NO,”WHICH IS INTELLECTUALLY ABSURD. HOWEVER, NOT SO IN ZEN!THE UNDIFFERENTIATED CENTER OF A CIRCLE THAT HAS NO CIRCUMFERENCE: THE JEET KUNEDO MAN SHOULD BE ON THE ALERT TO MEET THE INTERCHANGEABILITY OF THE OPPOSITES.BUT AS SOON AS HIS MIND “STOPS” WITH EITHER OF THEM, IT LOSES ITS OWN FLUIDITY.A JEET KUNE DO MAN SHOULD KEEP HIS MIND ALWAYS IN A STATE OF EMPTINESS SO THATHIS FREEDOM IN ACTION WILL NEVER BE OBSTRUCTED.WHEN THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTION OF WHATEVER KIND THE JEET KUNE DO MAN’S MOVEMENTSARE LIKE FLASHED LIGHTNING OR LIKE THE MIRROR REFLECTING IMAGES.THE SPIRIT IS NO DOUBT THE CONTROLLING AGENT OF OUR EXISTENCE (AS TO ITSWHEREABOUTS WE CAN NEVER TELL), ALTHOUGH IT IS ALTOGETHER BEYOND THE REALM OFCORPOREALITY. THIS INVISIBLE SEAT CONTROLS EVERY MOVEMENT IN WHATEVER EXTERNALSITUATION IT MAY HAPPEN TO FIND ITSELF.

BUT IN ACTUAL COMBAT, HIS MIND MUST BE CALM AND NOT AT ALL DISTURBED.HE MUST FEEL AS IF NOTHING CRITICAL IS HAPPENING. WHEN HE ADVANCES, HIS STEPSARE LIGHT AND SECURE, AND HIS EYES ARE NOT GLARINGLY FIXED ON THE ENEMY AS THOSEOF AN INSANE MAN MIGHT BE. HIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT IN ANY WAY DIFFERENT FROM HISEVERYDAY BEHAVIOR. NO CHANGE IS TAKING PLACE IN HIS EXPRESSION. NOTHING BETRAYSTHE FACT THAT HE IS NOW ENGAGED IN A MORTAL FIGHT.TECHNICAL SKILL IS TO BE SUBORDINATE TO THE PSYCHIC TRAINING, WHICH WILL FINALLYRAISE THE PRACTITIONER EVEN TO THE LEVEL OF HIGH SPIRITUALITY.A JEET KUNE DO MAN FACES REALITY, AND NOT CRYSTALLIZATION OF FORM.THE TOOL IS A TOOL OF FORMLESS FORM.NO-ABODE MEANS THAT THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS IS BEYOND HUMANUNDERSTANDING, BEYOND THE CATEGORIES OF TIME AND SPACE. AS IT THUS TRANSCENDSALL MODES OF RELATIVITY, IT IS CALLED “HAVING NO ABODE,” TO WHICH ANY POSSIBLEPREDICATIONS ARE APPLICABLE.HE IS NO MORE HIMSELF. HE MOVES AS A KIND OF AUTOMATON. HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF UPTO AN INFLUENCE OUTSIDE HIS EVERYDAY CONSCIOUSNESS, WHICH IS NO OTHER THAN HISOWN DEEPLY BURIED UNCONSCIOUS, WHOSE PRESENCE HE WAS NEVER HITHERTO AWARE OF.ART IS NEVER DECORATION, EMBELLISHMENT; INSTEAD IT IS THE WORK OF ENLIGHTENMENT.ART, IN OTHER WORDS, IS A TECHNIQUE FOR ACQUIRING LIBERTY.JEET KUNE DO BECAME KNOWN AS THE ART “NOT FOUNDED ON TECHNIQUES ORDOCTRINES”—JUST AS YOU ARE.ABSENCE OF THOUGHT: THE MIND SHOULD BE FREED FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE EXTERNALWORLD, TO LET THE MIND TAKE ITS COURSE UNHINDERED AMONG PHENOMENA.TO BRING THE MIND INTO SHARP FOCUS AND TO MAKE IT ALERT SO THAT IT CANIMMEDIATELY INTUIT TRUTH, WHICH IS EVERYWHERE, THE MIND MUST BE EMANCIPATED FROMOLD HABITS, PREJUDICES, RESTRICTIVE THOUGHT PROCESS, AND EVEN ORDINARY THOUGHTITSELF.THREE COMPONENTSABSENCE OF THOUGHT IS THE DOCTRINE: AND IT MEANS NOT TO BE CARRIED AWAY BYTHOUGHT IN THE PROCESS OF THOUGHT—NOT TO BE DEFILED BY EXTERNAL OBJECTS—TO BE INTHOUGHT YET DEVOID OF THOUGHT.“ABSENCE OF STEREOTYPED TECHNIQUE” AS THE SUBSTANCE IN ORDER TO BE TOTAL ANDFREE.NONATTACHMENT AS THE FOUNDATION.ALL LINES AND MOVEMENTS ARE THE FUNCTION.IT IS MAN’S ORIGINAL NATURE—IN ITS ORDINARY PROCESS, THOUGHT MOVES FORWARDWITHOUT A HALT; PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE THOUGHTS CONTINUE AS AN UNBROKENSTREAM.ABSENCE MEANS FREEDOM FROM DUALITY AND ALL DEFILEMENTS.THOUGHT MEANS THOUGHT OF THUSNESS AND SELF-NATURE.TRUE THUSNESS IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THOUGHT, AND THOUGHT IS THE FUNCTION OF TRUETHUSNESS.TO MEDITATE MEANS TO REALIZE THE IMPERTURBABILITY OF ONE’S ORIGINAL NATURE.MEDITATION MEANS TO BE FREE FROM ALL PHENOMENA, AND CALMNESS MEANS TO BEINTERNALLY UNPERTURBED. THERE WILL BE CALMNESS WHEN ONE IS FREE FROM EXTERNALOBJECTS AND IS NOT PERTURBED.TRUE THUSNESS IS WITHOUT DEFILING THOUGHT; IT CANNOT BE KNOWN THROUGH CONCEPTIONAND THOUGHT.THERE IS NO THOUGHT EXCEPT THAT OF THE TRUE THUSNESS. THUSNESS DOES NOT MOVE,BUT ITS MOTION AND FUNCTION ARE INEXHAUSTIBLE.THE MIND IS ORIGINALLY WITHOUT ACTIVITY; THE WAY IS ALWAYS WITHOUT THOUGHT.BY KNOWLEDGE IS MEANT KNOWING THE EMPTINESS AND TRANQUILLITY OF THE MIND.INSIGHT MEANS REALIZING THAT YOUR ORIGINAL NATURE IS NOT CREATED.BEING EMPTY MEANS HAVING NO APPEARANCE: HAVING NO STYLE OR FORM TO LET ONE’SOPPONENT WORK ON.BEING TRANQUIL MEANS NOT HAVING BEEN CREATED IN ITS THUSNESS; NOT BEING CREATEDMEANS NOT HAVING ANY ILLUSIONS OR DELUSIONS.NO CULTIVATION DOES NOT REALLY MEAN THE ABSENCE OF ANY KIND OF CULTIVATION. WHATIT SIGNIFIES IS A “CULTIVATION BY MEANS OF NON-CULTIVATION.” TO PRACTICECULTIVATION THROUGH CULTIVATION IS TO ACT WITH CONSCIOUS MIND, THAT IS TO SAY,TO PRACTICE ASSERTIVE ACTIVITY.SEPARATIONSEPARATION IS INEXPRESSIBLE BECAUSE AS SOON AS ONE TRIES TO EXPRESS IT, WHAT ONEEXPRESSES IS ITSELF A THING, WHICH MEANS THAT BY SO DOING ONE REMAINS IN THESTATE OF BEING LINKED WITH THINGS.JUST AS YELLOW LEAVES MAY BE TAKEN AS GOLD COINS IN ORDER TO STOP THE CRYING OFCHILDREN, THUS THE SO-CALLED SECRET MOVES AND CONTORTED POSTURES DO NOT MEANDOING NOTHING AT ALL, BUT ONLY TO HAVE NO DELIBERATE MIND IN WHATEVER ONE DOES.HAVE NO MIND THAT SELECTS OR REJECTS; TO BE WITHOUT DELIBERATE MIND IS TO HAVENO THOUGHTS.THERE IS NO NEED TO EXERT ONESELF IN SPECIAL CULTIVATION OUTSIDE THE DAILY ROUNDOF LIVING. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCH ENLIGHTENMENT AND WHAT ISORDINARILY TERMED KNOWLEDGE, FOR IN THE LATTER A CONTRAST EXISTS BETWEEN THEKNOWER AND THE KNOWN; WHEREAS IN THE FORMER THERE CAN BE NO SUCH CONTRAST.THE TWO DISEASES> 1. ONE IS RIDING AN ASS TO SEARCH FOR AN ASS.> > 2. ONE IS RIDING AN ASS AND BEING UNWILLING TO DISMOUNT.THERE ARE STYLES THAT FAVOR STRAIGHT LINES; THEN THERE ARE STYLES THAT FAVORROUND LINE CIRCLES. STYLES THAT CLING TO ONE PARTIAL ASPECT OF COMBAT ARE INBONDAGE. JEET KUNE DO IS A TECHNIQUE FOR ACQUIRING LIBERTY—IT IS THE WORK OFENLIGHTENMENT. ART IS NEVER DECORATION OR EMBELLISHMENT. A CHOICE METHOD,HOWEVER EXACTING, FIXES ITS PRACTITIONERS IN A PATTERN (COMBAT IS NEVER FIXED,BUT CHANGES FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT). IT IS BASICALLY A PRACTICE OF RESISTANCE.SUCH PRACTICE LEADS TO CLOGGINESS, AND UNDERSTANDING IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND ITSADHERENTS ARE NEVER FREE BECAUSE THE WAY OF COMBAT IS NOT BASED ON PERSONALCHOICE AND FANCIES. THE TRUTH OF THE WAY OF COMBAT IS PERCEIVED FROM MOMENT TOMOMENT, AND ONLY WHEN THERE IS AWARENESS WITHOUT CONDEMNATION, JUSTIFICATION, ORANY FORM OF INDENTIFICATION.JEET KUNE DO FAVORS FORMLESSNESS SO THAT IT CAN ASSUME ALL FORMS, AND SINCE ITHAS NO STYLE, THEREFORE JEET KUNE DO FITS IN WITH ALL STYLES. AS A RESULT, JEETKUNE DO USES ALL WAYS AND IS BOUND BY NONE, AND LIKEWISE IT USES ANY TECHNIQUESOR MEANS THAT SERVE ITS END. IN THIS ART, EFFICIENCY IS ANYTHING THAT SCORES.MANY MARTIAL ARTISTS LIKE “MORE,” LIKE “DIFFERENT,” NOT KNOWING WHAT THE TRUTHAND THE WAY EXHIBIT IN THE SIMPLE EVERYDAY MOVEMENTS, BECAUSE IT IS HERE THEYMISS THESE THINGS (IF THERE IS ANY SECRET, IT IS MISSED BY SEEKING). THEPHYSICAL-BOUND GOES FOR PUFFING AND STRAINING AND MISSES THE DELICATE WAY (THEFAN AND THE PLUG); THE INTELLECTUAL-BOUND GOES FOR IDEALISM AND THE EXOTIC ANDLACKS THE EFFICIENCY AND ACTUAL SEEING INTO REALITIES.WHEN INSUBSTANTIALITY AND SUBSTANTIALITY ARE NOT SET AND DEFINED, WHEN THERE ISNO TRACK OF CHANGING, ONE HAS MASTERED THE FORMLESS FORM. WHEN THERE IS ACLINGING TO FORM, WHEN THERE IS ATTACHMENT OF THE MIND, IT IS NOT THE TRUE PATH.WHEN TECHNIQUE COMES OUT OF ITSELF, IT IS THE WAY GROWING OUT OF NO WAY.THE IMMOVABLE MINDDO NOT BE OVERCONSCIOUS IN SPARRING, OR ELSE YOU WILL BE TIED DOWN—ONE WOULDRATHER TEACH THEM TO ADVANCE ONE STEP THAN TO THINK OF RETREATING ONE STEP.THE FIVE MAIN POINTS> 1. THE HIGHEST TRUTH IS INEXPRESSIBLE.> > 2. SPIRITUAL CULTIVATION CANNOT BE CULTIVATED.> > 3. IN THE LAST RESORT NOTHING IS GAINED.> > 4. THERE IS NOTHING MUCH IN THE TEACHING.> > 5.

BRUCE LEE PAPERS.5-NTHE THEMEBASICALLY THIS IS A STORY OF ONE MAN’S QUEST FOR HIS LIBERATION, THE RETURNINGTO HIS ORIGINAL SENSE OF FREEDOM. UNLIKE THE OLD WEST’S “FASTEST GUN ALIVE,” THEINDIVIDUAL IS NOT OUT TO SHARPEN HIS TOOLS TO DESTROY HIS ANTAGONIST; RATHER,HIS SIDE KICK, BACK FIST, HOOK KICK, AND SO FORTH, ARE DIRECTED PRIMARILY TOWARDHIMSELF.[../Images/203a.jpg]IT IS BECAUSE OF THE SELF THAT THERE ARISES THE FOE. WHEN THERE ARE NO SIGNS (ORTHOUGHT MOVEMENTS) STIRRED IN YOUR MIND, NO CONFLICTS OF OPPOSITION TAKE PLACETHERE; AND WHERE THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS (OF ONE TRYING TO “GET THE BETTER” OFTHE OTHER), THIS IS KNOWN AS “NEITHER SELF NOR FOE.” AT THEIR BEST, THE “TOOLS”THUS REPRESENT THE FORCE OF INTUITIVE OR INSTINCTIVE DIRECTNESS, WHICH UNLIKETHE INTELLECT, DOES NOT DIVIDE ITSELF, BLOCKING ITS OWN PASSAGEWAY. IT MARCHESONWARD WITHOUT LOOKING FORWARD OR SIDEWAYS.THE BASIC PROBLEM OF A MARTIAL ARTIST IS KNOWN AS “PSYCHICAL STOPPAGE.” THISOCCURS WHEN HE IS ENGAGED IN A DEADLY CONTEST WITH HIS ANTAGONIST, AND HIS MINDATTACHES ITSELF TO THOUGHTS OR ANY OBJECT IT ENCOUNTERS. UNLIKE THE FLUID MINDIN EVERYDAY LIFE, HIS MIND IS “STOPPED,” INCAPABLE OF FLOWING FROM ONE OBJECT TOANOTHER WITHOUT STICKINESS OR CLOGGINESS. AT THIS POINT, THE MARTIAL ARTISTCEASES TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF, AND, AS A RESULT, HIS TOOLS NO LONGER EXPRESSTHEMSELVES IN THEIR SUCHNESS. SO TO HAVE SOMETHING IN ONE’S MIND MEANS THAT ITIS PREOCCUPIED AND HAS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE; HOWEVER, TO ATTEMPT TO REMOVETHE THOUGHT ALREADY IN IT IS TO REFILL IT WITH ANOTHER SOMETHING!ULTIMATELY, ONE SHOULD BE “PURPOSELESS.” BY “PURPOSELESS” IS NOT MEANT MEREABSENCE OF THINGS WHERE VACANT NOTHINGNESS PREVAILS. THE OBJECT IS NOT TO BESTUCK WITH THOUGHT PROCESS. THE SPIRIT IS BY NATURE FORMLESS, AND NO “OBJECTS”ARE TO BE STUCK IN IT. WHEN ANYTHING IS STUCK THERE, YOUR PSYCHIC ENERGY LOSESITS BALANCE; ITS NATIVE ACTIVITY BECOMES CRAMPED AND NO LONGER FLOWS WITH THESTREAM. WHERE THE ENERGY IS TIPPED, THERE IS TOO MUCH OF IT IN ONE DIRECTION,WHILE IN ANOTHER THERE IS A SHORTAGE. WHERE THERE IS TOO MUCH, IT OVERFLOWS ANDCANNOT BE CONTROLLED; WHERE THERE IS A SHORTAGE, IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLYNOURISHED AND SHRIVELS UP. IN BOTH CASES, IT IS UNABLE TO COPE WITHEVER-CHANGING SITUATIONS.ULTIMATELY, ONE SHOULD BE “PURPOSELESS.” BY “PURPOSELESS” IS NOT MEANT MEREABSENCE OF THINGS WHERE VACANT NOTHINGNESS PREVAILS.THE OBJECT IS NOT TO BESTUCK WITH THOUGHT PROCESS.THE SPIRIT IS BY NATURE FORMLESS, AND NO “OBJECTS”ARE TO BE STUCK IN IT.BUT WHEN THERE PREVAILS A STATE OF “PURPOSELESSNESS” (WHICH IS ALSO A STATE OFFLUIDITY, EMPTY-MINDEDNESS, OR SIMPLY THE EVERYDAY MIND), THE SPIRIT HARBORSNOTHING IN IT, NOR IS IT TIPPED IN ANY ONE DIRECTION; IT TRANSCENDS BOTH SUBJECTAND OBJECT; IT RESPONDS EMPTY-MINDEDLY TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND LEAVES NOTRACK. IN CHUANG-TZU’S WORDS: “THE PERFECT MAN EMPLOYS HIS MIND AS A MIRROR—ITGRASPS NOTHING, YET IT REFUSES NOTHING; IT RECEIVES, BUT DOES NOT KEEP.” LIKEWATER FILLING A POND, WHICH IS ALWAYS READY TO FLOW OFF AGAIN, THE SPIRIT CANWORK ITS INEXHAUSTIBLE POWER BECAUSE IT IS FREE AND IS OPEN TO EVERYTHINGBECAUSE IT IS EMPTY.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE ENTITLED “THE THEME,” FROM HIS NOTES FORTHE SILENT FLUTE, MAY 1970.

THE MASTERSEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THEM, BUT WHEN THEIR REMARKS BECAME RUDER AND MOREPOINTED, HE RAISED HIS CHOPSTICKS AND, IN QUICK SNIPS, EFFORTLESSLY CAUGHT FOURFLIES ON THE WING. AS HE SLOWLY LAID DOWN THE CHOPSTICKS, THE THREE SWORDS-MENHURRIEDLY LEFT THE ROOM.THIS STORY ILLUSTRATES A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORIENTAL AND WESTERN THINKING.THE AVERAGE WESTERNER WOULD BE INTRIGUED BY SOMEONE’S ABILITY TO CATCH FLIESWITH CHOPSTICKS, AND WOULD PROBABLY SAY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW GOOD HEIS IN COMBAT. BUT THE ORIENTAL WOULD REALIZE THAT A MAN WHO HAS ATTAINED SUCHCOMPLETE MASTERY OF AN ART REVEALS HIS PRESENCE OF MIND IN EVERY ACTION. THESTATE OF WHOLENESS AND IMPERTURBABILITY DEMONSTRATED BY THE MASTER INDICATED HISMASTERY OF SELF.AND SO IT IS WITH MARTIAL ARTS. TO THE WESTERNER, THE FINGER JABS, THE SIDEKICKS, THE BACK FIST, AND SO FORTH, ARE TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE,WHICH, INDEED, ARE A COUPLE OF THEIR FUNCTIONS. BUT THE ORIENTAL BELIEVES THATTHE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF SUCH TOOLS IS REVEALED WHEN THEY ARE SELF-DIRECTED ANDDESTROY GREED, FEAR, ANGER, AND FOLLY.TO THE WESTERNER, THE FINGER JABS, THE SIDE KICKS, THE BACK FIST, AND SO FORTH,ARE TOOLS OF DESTRUCTION AND VIOLENCE, WHICH, INDEED, ARE A COUPLE OF THEIRFUNCTIONS. BUT THE ORIENTAL BELIEVES THAT THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF SUCH TOOLS ISREVEALED WHEN THEY ARE SELF-DIRECTED AND DESTROY GREED, FEAR, ANGER, AND FOLLY.MANIPULATIVE SKILL IS NOT THE ORIENTAL’S GOAL. HE IS AIMING HIS KICKS AND BLOWSAT HIMSELF, AND WHEN SUCCESSFUL, HE MAY EVEN SUCCEED IN KNOCKING HIMSELF OUT.AFTER YEARS OF TRAINING, HE HOPES TO ACHIEVE THAT VITAL LOOSENING AND EQUABILITYOF ALL POWERS, WHICH IS WHAT THE THREE SWORDSMEN SAW IN THE MASTER.IN EVERYDAY LIFE THE MIND IS CAPABLE OF MOVING FROM ONE THOUGHT OR OBJECT TOANOTHER—“BEING” MIND INSTEAD OF “HAVING” MIND. HOWEVER, WHEN ONE IS FACE TO FACEWITH AN OPPONENT IN A DEADLY CONTEST, THE MIND TENDS TO STICK AND LOSES ITSMOBILITY. STICK-ABILITY OR STOPPAGE IS A PROBLEM THAT HAUNTS EVERY MARTIALARTIST.KWAN-YIN (AVALOKITESVARA), THE GODDESS OF MERCY, IS SOMETIMES REPRESENTED WITHONE THOUSAND ARMS, EACH HOLDING A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT. IF HER MIND STOPS WITHTHE USE, FOR INSTANCE, OF A SPEAR, ALL THE OTHER ARMS (999) WILL BE OF NO USEWHATEVER. IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF HER MIND NOT STOPPING WITH THE USE OF ONE ARM,BUT MOVING FROM ONE INSTRUMENT TO ANOTHER, THAT ALL HER ARMS PROVE USEFUL WITHTHE UTMOST DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY. THUS THIS FIGURE IS MEANT TO DEMONSTRATE THATWHEN THE ULTIMATE TRUTH IS REALIZED, EVEN AS MANY AS ONE THOUSAND ARMS ON ONEBODY MAY EACH BE SERVICEABLE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.“PURPOSELESSNESS,” “EMPTY-MINDEDNESS,” OR “NO ART” ARE FREQUENT TERMS USED INTHE ORIENT TO DENOTE THE ULTIMATE ACHIEVEMENT OF A MARTIAL ARTIST. ACCORDING TOZEN, THE SPIRIT IS BY NATURE FORMLESS, AND NO “OBJECTS” ARE TO BE HARBORED INIT. WHEN ANYTHING IS HARBORED THERE, PSYCHIC ENERGY LOSES ITS BALANCE, ITSNATIVE ACTIVITY BECOMES CRAMPED, AND IT NO LONGER FLOWS WITH THE STREAM. WHERETHE ENERGY IS TIPPED, THERE IS TOO MUCH OF IT IN ONE DIRECTION AND A SHORTAGE OFIT IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. WHERE THERE IS TOO MUCH ENERGY, IT OVERFLOWS AND CANNOTBE CONTROLLED. IN EITHER CASE, IT IS UNABLE TO COPE WITH EVER-CHANGINGSITUATIONS. BUT WHEN THERE PREVAILS A STATE OF “PURPOSELESSNESS” (WHICH IS ALSOA STATE OF FLUIDITY OR MINDLESSNESS), THE SPIRIT HARBORS NOTHING IN IT, NOR ISIT TIPPED IN ONE DIRECTION. IT TRANSCENDS BOTH SUBJECT AND OBJECT; IT RESPONDSWITH AN EMPTY-MIND TO WHATEVER IS HAPPENING.TRUE MASTERY TRANSCENDS ANY PARTICULAR ART. IT STEMS FROM MASTERY OF ONESELF—THEABILITY, DEVELOPED THROUGH SELF-DISCIPLINE, TO BE CALM, FULLY AWARE, ANDCOMPLETELY IN TUNE WITH ONESELF AND THE SURROUNDINGS. THEN, AND ONLY THEN, CAN APERSON KNOW HIMSELF.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN FOREWORD TO HIS PERSONAL COPY OF THE SCRIPT OFTHE SILENT FLUTE, OCTOBER 19, 1970.

SOME EXPRESSIONSHAVE TASTE, SOME ARE LOGICAL (MAYBE UNDER CERTAIN REQUIRED SITUATIONS), BUT MOSTINVOLVE MERELY PERFORMING SOME SORT OF A MECHANICAL REPETITION OF A FIXEDPATTERN.THIS IS MOST UNHEALTHY BECAUSE TO LIVE IS TO EXPRESS, AND TO EXPRESS YOU HAVE TOCREATE. CREATION IS NEVER SOMETHING OLD, AND DEFINITELY NOT MERELY REPETITION.REMEMBER WELL MY FRIEND THAT ALL STYLES ARE MAN-MADE, AND THE MAN IS ALWAYS MOREIMPORTANT THAN ANY STYLE. STYLE CONCLUDES. MAN GROWS.[../Images/207a.jpg]SO MARTIAL ART IS ULTIMATELY AN ATHLETIC EXPRESSION OF THE DYNAMIC HUMAN BODY.MORE IMPORTANT YET IS THE PERSON WHO IS THERE EXPRESSING HIS OWN SOUL. YES,MARTIAL ART IS AN UNFOLDING OF WHAT A PERSON IS—HIS ANGER, HIS FEARS—AND YETUNDER ALL THESE NATURAL HUMAN TENDENCIES, WHICH WE ALL EXPERIENCE, AFTER ALL, A“QUALITY” MARTIAL ARTIST CAN—IN THE MIDST OF ALL THESE COMMOTIONS—STILL BEHIMSELF.AND IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WINNING OR LOSING, BUT IT IS A QUESTION OF BEINGWHAT IS AT THAT MOMENT AND BEING WHOLEHEARTEDLY INVOLVED WITH THAT PARTICULARMOMENT AND DOING ONE’S BEST. THE CONSEQUENCE IS LEFT TO WHATEVER WILL HAPPEN.THEREFORE TO BE A MARTIAL ARTIST ALSO MEANS TO BE AN ARTIST OF LIFE. SINCE LIFEIS AN EVER-GOING PROCESS, ONE SHOULD FLOW IN THIS PROCESS AND DISCOVER HOW TOACTUALIZE AND EXPAND ONESELF.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY, UNTITLED.

THIS CAN BEDUE PARTLY TO BEING HUMAN, AND PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE PATTERNS OF STYLES(CONSEQUENTLY FINDING A REFRESHING, ORIGINAL MASTER TEACHER IS A RARITYNOWADAYS). EVER SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF INSTITUTES, ACADEMIES, SCHOOLS,KWOONS AND THEIR STYLIZED INSTRUCTORS, THE NEED FOR A “POINTER OF THE WAY” ISECHOED.[../Images/208a.jpg]EACH MAN BELONGS TO A STYLE THAT CLAIMS TO POSSESS TRUTH TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALLOTHER STYLES, AND THESE STYLES BECOME INSTITUTES WITH THEIR EXPLANATIONS OF THEWAY, DISSECTING AND ISOLATING THE HARMONY OF FIRMNESS AND GENTLENESS,ESTABLISHING RHYTHMIC FORMS AS THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THEIR PARTICULAR TECHNIQUES.ALL GOALS, APART FROM THE MEANS, ARE THEREFORE AN ILLUSION, AND BECOMING IS ADENIAL OF BEING. BY AN ERROR REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE AGES, TRUTH, BECOMING A LAWOR A FAITH, PLACES OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF KNOWLEDGE. METHOD, WHICH IS IN ITSVERY SUBSTANCE IGNORANCE, ENCLOSES “TRUTH” WITHIN A VICIOUS CIRCLE.

RANGING FROM KARATE MEN, HAPKIDO MEN, JUDO MEN,AND SO FORTH, AND SO ON. FORGETTING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY POSSESS THEABILITY TO ACT, JUST SO AS THEY CAN KICK OR PUNCH HALFWAY DECENT AND KNOW A FEWTRICKS OR GIMMICKS, THE PRODUCERS WILL MAKE THEM A “STAR.”[../Images/209a.jpg]NOW LET’S STOP ABOUT HERE. IS IT THAT SIMPLE TO BECOME A STAR? WELL, I CANASSURE YOU IT’S NOT THAT SIMPLE. ALSO, I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS MORE [OF] BRUCELEE’S FILMS ARE SHOWN, THE AUDIENCE WILL SOON REALIZE NOT ONLY IN ACTINGABILITY, BUT IN PHYSICAL SKILL AS WELL—THEY WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. FOREXAMPLE, IN THE WAY OF THE DRAGON, BRUCE LEE’S SKILL IS MATCHED WITH [THAT OF]AN AMERICAN CHAMPION, CHUCK NORRIS, WHO HAPPENS TO BE A SEVEN-TIME WINNER OFBOTH THE ALL-AMERICAN OPEN AND THE WORLD KARATE CHAMPIONSHIP. THEN THERE IS BOBWALL, THE 1970 HEAVYWEIGHT KARATE CHAMPION, PLUS WONG IN SIK, THE SEVENTH-DEGREEHAPKIDO EXPERT, AND SOME AUDIENCES MAY HAVE SEEN HIM IN THE FILM CALLED HAPKIDO.“OF COURSE, IT IS ONLY MOVIE-MAKING,” PEOPLE WILL SAY. BUT I’M SURE THAT THEAUDIENCES ARE NOT SO INSENSITIVE AS TO NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AND JUDGE BYTHEMSELVES AND COMPARE THE SPEED, POWER, RHYTHM, COORDINATION, VERSATILITY, ANDSO FORTH, OF THESE MEN.BLACK BELT MAGAZINE, THE WORLD’S LARGEST AND A WELL-RESPECTED MARTIAL ARTMAGAZINE, HAS FEATURED QUITE A FEW MAGAZINE ARTICLES ON BRUCE LEE [WRITTEN]BEFORE HE BECAME AN ACTOR. I MUST EMPHASIZE HERE THAT BLACK BELT IS A SORT OF ASTANDARD OF WHAT THE INTERNATIONAL [MARTIAL ARTS] SCENE IS ALL ABOUT—A QUALITYAND AUTHORITATIVE MAGAZINE. IN AN EXCLUSIVE BLACK BELT INTERVIEW SURVEY DONE NOTTOO LONG AGO, SOME OPINIONS [WERE] EXPRESSED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY MARTIALARTS EXPERTS ABOUT THE FIGHTING ABILITY OF BRUCE LEE.ERNEST LIEBERNEST LIEB IS A FIFTH-DEGREE BLACK BELT (KARATE) AND THE DIRECTOR OF THEAMERICAN KARATE ASSOCIATION IN THE UNITED STATES. HE HAS THIS TO SAY ABOUT BRUCELEE: “I HAVE MET MR. LEE AND HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING OUT WITH HIMSEVERAL TIMES. ALTHOUGH I HAVE WON FORTY-TWO KARATE TOURNAMENTS, I DO NOTCONSIDER MYSELF A MATCH FOR HIM. HIS SPEED SURPASSES MOST OF THE BLACK BELTS IKNOW.”JHOON RHEEJHOON RHEE, A SEVENTH-DEGREE BLACK BELT IN TAE KWON DO, WHO IS GENERALLYREGARDED AS THE MAN WHO INTRODUCED THE KOREAN ART OF TAE KWON DO TO AMERICA,DESCRIBES BRUCE’S JEET KUNE DO AS “VERY SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL, ESPECIALLY INSTREET SITUATIONS.”CHUCK NORRISCHUCK NORRIS, THE AMERICAN KARATE CHAMPION WHO RECENTLY DID A MOVIE WITH BRUCECALLED THE WAY OF THE DRAGON, READILY ADMITTED TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WATCHING TVIN A RECENT INTERVIEW IN HONG KONG THAT BRUCE WAS HIS “TEACHER,” AND HECONSIDERS HIM TO BE “FANTASTIC.” I MUST ALSO ADD HERE THAT, AT THE SAME TIME,TWO OTHER CHAMPIONS IN KARATE—THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION JOE LEWIS AND THE LIGHTHEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION MIKE STONE, HAVE, ALONG WITH CHUCK, BEEN TAKING LESSONSFROM BRUCE. NOW ALL THREE OF THESE MEN ARE FROM DIFFERENT STYLES AND ALL AREWELL ESTABLISHED. YET THEY COME TO LEARN UNDER BRUCE. IN THE SPORT WEEK SECTIONOF THE WASHINGTON STAR, PRINTED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

HE KNOWS WHAT CONSTITUTES ACHAMPION AND A GOOD COMPETITOR. HE HAS THIS TO SAY ABOUT BRUCE: “BRUCE ISCOLORFUL, FASCINATING, AND INCOMPARABLE.” MR. JAY GOES ON TO SAYING THAT HE IS“CONSTANTLY AMAZED HOW BRUCE CAN MAINTAIN HIS LIGHTNING SPEED WITHOUTSACRIFICING HIS TREMENDOUS PUNCHING POWER.” WALLY HAS BEEN IN THE MARTIAL ARTFOR OVER FORTY YEARS. HE COMPARES BRUCE “WITH THE GRACE AND THE AGILITY AND THEPOWER OF A BLACK PANTHER.”LOUIS DELGADOLOUIS DELGADO, WHO’S A BLACK BELT HOLDER AND WHO ONCE BEAT CHUCK NORRIS FOR THEGRAND CHAMPIONSHIP IN NEW YORK, DESCRIBES BRUCE LEE IN THE NOVEMBER 1969 ISSUEOF BLACK BELT MAGAZINE AS FOLLOWS: “I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE BRUCE LEE. IHAVE MET AND SPARRED WITH SEVERAL KARATE MEN, BUT BRUCE HAS BEEN THE ONLY ONEWHO HAS BAFFLED ME COMPLETELY. I AM COMPLETELY IN AWE WHEN I FIGHT WITH HIM.”JAY MATHERIN AN OPEN LETTER ANNOUNCING THE FORTHCOMING KARATE WINTER CHAMPIONSHIPS, JAYMATHER, THE TOURNAMENT HOLDER WHO IS ALSO A BLACK BELT HOLDER, DESCRIBES BRUCE’SABILITY AS HAVING “MADE HIM A LEGEND IN HIS OWN TIME.”HAYWARD NISHIOKAHAYWARD NISHIOKA, THE JAPANESE-AMERICAN NATIONAL JUDO CHAMPION, IS ALSO A BLACKBELT HOLDER IN THE SHOTOKAN STYLE OF KARATE. HAYWARD RAN A SCIENTIFIC TEST IN ACALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY TO FIND OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KARATE PUNCH AND AJEET KUNE DO PUNCH. AND THE FINDING WAS THAT, INDEED, THE JEET KUNE DO PUNCH ISMORE POWERFUL AND DESTRUCTIVE THAN THE CLASSICAL KARATE PUNCH.JOE LEWISONE THING WORTH MENTIONING HERE THAT IS QUITE INTERESTING (THOUGH I AM AWARETHAT THE HONG KONG MARTIAL ARTS CIRCLE IS NOT SO FAMILIAR WITH THE AMERICANMARTIAL ARTS CIRCLE) IS THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN BRUCE LEE AND THE UNDISPUTEDHEAVYWEIGHT KARATE CHAMPION, JOE LEWIS. FROM WHAT I GATHER, DEEP DOWN INSIDE JOELEWIS LIES A DEEP RESPECT OF WHAT BRUCE KNOWS AND HIS ABILITY TO PERFORM.[../Images/213a.jpg]IN CASE YOU DON’T KNOW ABOUT JOE LEWIS’S IMAGE IN THE MARTIAL ARTS CIRCLES INAMERICA, HE IS KIND OF LIKE THE “BAD BOY” OF KARATE. MANY PEOPLE LOOK UPON HIMAS A BULLY. WELL, HE DID BREAK A FEW RIBS; IN FACT, WHEN BOB WALL, ONE OF HISSTUDENTS, WHO ALSO APPEARED IN BRUCE’S THE WAY OF THE DRAGON, FIRST MET JOE IN AFREESTYLE SPARRING, THREE OF BOB’S RIBS WERE BROKEN BY A SIDE KICK BY JOE LEWIS.ALTHOUGH JOE IS EGOTISTICAL AND COCKY BY NATURE, HE IS GOOD AT WHAT HE IS DOING.ACCORDING TO BLACK BELT MAGAZINE’S 1968 YEARBOOK, IN WHICH THEY REPORTED ONLEWIS’S WIN AT THE NATIONAL KARATE TOURNAMENT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.:> HERE, LEWIS WAS IN RARE FORM AND APPARENTLY REBORN WITH A NEW TECHNIQUE,> INCORPORATING JEET KUNE DO, AND AN AMBITION TO CONQUER ANY OPPOSITION TO HIS> THIRD STRAIGHT KARATE CHAMPIONSHIP IN THIS ARENA.

IT LOOKED LIKE A NEW LEWIS ON THE MAT.IN CASE YOU HAVE MISSED THE RECENT NEWS, BRUCE LEE’S JEET KUNE DO—OF WHICH HE ISTHE FOUNDER—HAS BEEN ELECTED AND ACCEPTED INTO THE BLACK BELT HALL OF FAME INAMERICA. THIS MARKS THE FIRST TIME A RECENTLY DEVELOPED FORM OF MARTIAL ART HASBEEN ACCEPTED NATIONALLY. NO, JEET KUNE DO IS NOT THOUSANDS OR EVEN HUNDREDS OFYEARS OLD. IT WAS STARTED AROUND 1965 BY A DEDICATED AND INTENSIFIED MAN CALLEDBRUCE LEE. AND HIS MARTIAL ART IS SOMETHING THAT NO SERIOUS MARTIAL ARTIST CANIGNORE. AND ALONG WITH HIS SKILL AND WISDOM, THERE LIES A REAL MAN, AND I CANONLY PROUDLY SAY THAT HE IS ONE OF US; OUR REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT CHINESEMARTIAL ART IS ALL ABOUT.

HIS FATHER,LEE HOI CHUEN, WAS A VERY FAMOUS ACTOR IN THE CANTONESE OPERA, SO MANY OF LEE’SFAMILY FRIENDS WERE AND REMAINED ACTORS.ACTING WAS AN ART FORM THAT CONTINUED TO HOLD LEE’S FASCINATION THROUGHOUT HISLIFETIME. EVEN AFTER HE HAD EFFECTIVELY “MADE IT” IN THE BUSINESS, HAVING BECOMETHE HOTTEST FILM PROPERTY IN THE WORLD BY 1973, HE WAS STILL PURCHASING BOOKS ONTHE ART AND CRAFT OF ACTING AND FILMMAKING IN AN EFFORT TO CONTINUE BROADENINGHIS UNDERSTANDING AND ABILITY TO BECOME WHAT HE TERMED AN “EFFICIENT DELIVERER.”THESE ESSAYS WERE DRAFTED AFTER LEE HAD RETURNED TO MAKE FILMS IN HONG KONGBETWEEN 1971 AND 1973. EXACT DATES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, AS LEE DID NOT INDICATETHEM ON HIS DRAFTS.

YOU OWN YOUR RIGHT(ALTHOUGH CHOICE REQUIRES SOME SELF-INQUIRY HERE, IT IS STILL YOUR CHOICE; YOUHAVE THAT RIGHT).[../Images/217a.jpg]MY MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS’ EXPERIENCE AS AN ACTOR HAS CAUSED ME TO LOOK AT ITTHUSLY: AN ACTOR IS A DEDICATED BEING WHO WORKS VERY HARD—SO DAMN HARD THAT HISLEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING MAKES HIM A QUALIFIED ARTIST IN SELF-EXPRESSION,PHYSICALLY, PSYCHOLOGICALLY, AS WELL AS SPIRITUALLY, TO CAPTIVATE.MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I AM A MARTIAL ARTIST BY CHOICE, AN ACTOR BY PROFESSION,AND, BY DAILY ACTUALIZING MY POTENTIALITY THROUGH SOULFUL DISCOVERIES AND DAILYEXERCISING (IN MY CASE) I HOPE TO BECOME ALSO AN ARTIST OF LIFE.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN NOTES ENTITLED “WHAT IS AN ACTOR?” BRUCE LEEPAPERS.6-BAN ACTOR: THE SUM TOTALDEPENDING ON ONE’S LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING, THE MOVIE INDUSTRY NOWADAYS ISBASICALLY A COEXISTENCE OF PRACTICAL BUSINESS SENSE AND CREATIVE TALENT, EACHBEING THE CAUSE AND THE EFFECT OF THE OTHER.TO THE ADMINISTRATORS UP IN THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, AN ACTOR IS ACOMMODITY, A PRODUCT, A MATTER OF MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. “WHETHER OR NOT IT SELLS”IS THEIR CHIEF CONCERN. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE BOX-OFFICE APPEAL. IN A WAYTHEY ARE WRONG, YET IN A WAY THEY ARE RIGHT. I WILL GO INTO THAT LATER.

JUSTAS NO TWO HUMAN BEINGS ARE ALIKE, SO TOO WITH ACTORS.A REALLY TRAINED, GOOD ACTOR IS A RARITY NOWADAYS—THAT DEMANDS THE ACTOR TO BEREAL, TO BE HIMSELF. THE AUDIENCES ARE NOT DUMB TODAY; AN ACTOR IS NOT SIMPLYDEMONSTRATING WHAT HE WANTS OTHERS TO BELIEVE HE IS EXPRESSING. THAT IS MEREIMITATION OR ILLUSTRATION BUT IT IS NOT CREATING, EVEN THOUGH THIS SUPERFICIALDEMONSTRATION CAN BE “PERFORMED” WITH REMARKABLE EXPERTISE.JUST WHAT, THEN, IS AN ACTOR OF QUALITY? TO BEGIN WITH, HE IS NO “MOVIE STAR,”WHICH IS NOTHING BUT AN ABSTRACT WORD GIVEN BY THE PEOPLE, AND A SYMBOL. THEREARE MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BECOME “MOVIE STARS” THAN [PEOPLE WHO WANT TOBECOME] ACTORS. TO ME, AN ACTOR IS THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THAT HE IS—HIS HIGHLEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE, HIS APPROPRIATE GOOD TASTE, HIS EXPERIENCE OFHAPPINESS AND ADVERSITIES, HIS INTENSITY, HIS EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND MUCH,MUCH MORE— LIKE I SAID, THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THAT HE IS.ONE MORE INGREDIENT IS THAT AN ACTOR HAS TO BE REAL IN EXPRESSING HIMSELF AS HEWOULD HONESTLY IN A GIVEN SITUATION.

THOUGH I HAVETO INTERRUPT HERE TO SAY THAT AT ONE TIME, QUITE A LONG TIME AGO, I DID GET ONTHE KICK OF SELF-IMAGE ACTUALIZATION RATHER THAN “SELF-ACTUALIZATION.”[../Images/237a.jpg]I HAVE DISCOVERED ANOTHER QUALITY OVER THE SPREAD OF A DECADE. I HAVE LONG BEENIN THE PROCESS OF DISCOVERING THROUGH EARNEST PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND DEDICATEDLEARNING THAT ULTIMATELY THE GREATEST HELP IS SELF-HELP. THAT THERE IS NO OTHERHELP BUT SELF-HELP, TO HONESTLY DO ONE’S BEST, DEDICATING ONESELF WHOLEHEARTEDLYTO A GIVEN TASK, WHICH HAPPENS TO HAVE NO END BUT, RATHER, IS AN ONGOINGPROCESS.I HAVE DONE A LOT DURING THESE YEARS OF MY PROCESS. WELL, IN MY PROCESS I HAVECHANGED FROM SELF-IMAGE ACTUALIZATION TO SELF-ACTUALIZATION, FROM BLINDLYFOLLOWING PROPAGANDA, ORGANIZED TRUTHS, AND SO FORTH, TO SEARCHING INTERNALLYFOR THE CAUSE OF MY IGNORANCE.

FORTUNATELY FOR ME, MYSELF-KNOWLEDGE HAS TRANSCENDED THAT, AND I’VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT LIFE ISBEST LIVED—NOT CONCEPTUALIZED.I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I AM GROWING DAILY AND HONESTLY, AND I DON’T KNOW WHERE MYULTIMATE LIMIT LIES. TO BE CERTAIN, EVERY DAY THERE CAN BE A REVELATION OR A NEWDISCOVERY THAT I CAN OBTAIN. HOWEVER, THE MOST GRATIFICATION IS YET TO COME, TOHEAR ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SAY, “HEY, NOW HERE IS SOMETHING REAL!”I AM HAPPY BECAUSE I AM GROWING DAILY AND HONESTLY, AND I DON’T KNOW WHERE MYULTIMATE LIMIT LIES. TO BE CERTAIN, EVERY DAY THERE CAN BE A REVELATION OR A NEWDISCOVERY THAT I CAN OBTAIN.OH, I KNOW, I AM NOT CALLED UPON TO WRITE ANY TRUE CONFESSION, BUT I DO WANT TOBE HONEST—THAT IS THE LEAST A HUMAN BEING CAN DO. BASICALLY, I HAVE ALWAYS BEENA MARTIAL ARTIST BY CHOICE, AND ACTOR BY PROFESSION. BUT, ABOVE ALL, I AM HOPINGTO ACTUALIZE MYSELF TO BE AN ARTIST OF LIFE ALONG THE WAY.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN PERSONAL ESSAY ENTITLED “IN MY OWN PROCESS,”CIRCA 1973. BRUCE LEE PAPERS.[../Images/239a.jpg]BY MARTIAL ART, I MEAN, LIKE ANY ART, IT IS AN UNRESTRICTED ATHLETIC EXPRESSIONOF AN INDIVIDUAL SOUL. OH YES, MARTIAL ART ALSO MEANS DAILY HERMITLIKE PHYSICALTRAINING TO UPGRADE OR MAINTAIN ONE’S QUALITY. HOWEVER, MARTIAL ART IS ALSOABOUT THE UNFOLDING [OF] THE BARE HUMAN SOUL. THAT IS WHAT INTERESTS ME.YES, I HAVE GROWN QUITE A BIT SINCE THE DAY WHEN I FIRST BECAME A MARTIALARTIST, AND I AM STILL GROWING AS I CONTINUE MY PROCESS. TO LIVE IS TO EXPRESSONESELF FREELY IN CREATION. CREATION, I MUST SAY, IS NOT A FIXED SOMETHING, ASOLIDIFICATION.SO I HOPE MY FELLOW MARTIAL ARTISTS WOULD OPEN UP AND BE TRANSPARENTLY REAL, ANDI WISH THEM WELL IN THEIR OWN PROCESS OF FINDING THEIR CAUSE.7-JTHE PASSIONATE STATE OF MINDWE CAN SEE THROUGH OTHERS ONLY WHEN WE SEE THROUGH OURSELVES.LACK OF SELF-AWARENESS RENDERS US TRANSPARENT; A SOUL THAT KNOWS ITSELF ISOPAQUE.IT IS COMPASSION RATHER THAN THE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE THAT CAN GUARD US AGAINSTBEING INJURIOUS TO OUR FELLOW MAN.WE HAVE MORE FAITH IN WHAT WE IMITATE THAN IN WHAT WE ORIGINATE. WE CANNOTDERIVE A SENSE OF ABSOLUTE CERTITUDE FROM ANYTHING THAT HAS ITS ROOTS IN US. THEMOST POIGNANT SENSE OF INSECURITY COMES FROM STANDING ALONE; WE ARE NOT ALONEWHEN WE IMITATE. IT IS THUS WITH MOST OF US! WE ARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY WEARE. WE KNOW OURSELVES CHIEFLY BY HEARSAY.OUR SENSE OF POWER IS MORE VIVID WHEN WE BREAK A MAN’S SPIRIT THAN WHEN WE WINHIS HEART. FOR WE CAN WIN A MAN’S HEART ONE DAY AND LOSE IT THE NEXT. BUT WHENWE BREAK A PROUD SPIRIT WE ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS FINAL AND ABSOLUTE.FEAR COMES FROM UNCERTAINTY. WHEN WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN, WHETHER OF OURWORTH OR WORTHLESSNESS, WE ARE ALMOST IMPERVIOUS TO FEAR. THUS A FEELING OFUTTER UNWORTHINESS CAN BE A SOURCE OF COURAGE.THERE IS A POWERFUL CRAVING IN MOST OF US TO SEE OURSELVES AS INSTRUMENTS IN THEHANDS OF OTHERS AND THUS FREE OURSELVES FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTS THATARE PROMPTED BY OUR OWN QUESTIONABLE INCLINATIONS AND IMPULSES. BOTH THE STRONGAND THE WEAK GRASP AT THE ALIBI. THE LATTER HIDE THEIR MALEVOLENCE UNDER THEVIRTUE OF OBEDIENCE; THEY ACTED DISHONORABLY BECAUSE THEY HAD TO OBEY ORDERS.THE STRONG, TOO, CLAIM ABSOLUTION BY PROCLAIMING THEMSELVES THE CHOSENINSTRUMENT OF A HIGHER POWER—GOD, HISTORY, FATE, NATION, OR HUMANITY.EVERYTHING SEEMS POSSIBLE WHEN WE ARE ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS OR ABSOLUTELYPOWERFUL—AND BOTH STATES STIMULATE OUR CREDULITY.PRIDE IS A SENSE OF WORTH DERIVED FROM SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ORGANICALLY PART OFUS; WHILE SELF-ESTEEM DERIVES FROM THE POTENTIALITIES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF SELF.WE ARE PROUD WHEN WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES WITH AN IMAGINARY SELF, A LEADER, A HOLYCAUSE, A COLLECTIVE BODY OF POSSESSIONS. THERE IS FEAR AND INTOLERANCE IN PRIDE;IT IS INSENSITIVE AND UNCOMPROMISING. THE LESS PROMISE AND POTENCY IN THE SELF,THE MORE IMPERATIVE IS THE NEED FOR PRIDE. THE CORE OF PRIDE IS SELF-REJECTION.IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN PRIDE RELEASES ENERGIES AND SERVES AS A SPUR TOACHIEVEMENT, IT CAN LEAD TO A RECONCILIATION WITH THE SELF AND THE ATTAINMENT OFGENUINE SELF-ESTEEM.WE ACQUIRE A SENSE OF WORTH EITHER BY REALIZING OUR TALENTS, OR BY KEEPING BUSY,OR BY IDENTIFYING OURSELVES WITH SOMETHING APART FROM US—BE IT A CAUSE, ALEADER, A GROUP, POSSESSIONS AND THE LIKE. OF THE THREE, THE PATH OFSELF-REALIZATION IS THE MOST DIFFICULT. IT IS TAKEN ONLY WHEN OTHER AVENUES TO ASENSE OF WORTH ARE MORE OR LESS BLOCKED. MEN OF TALENT HAVE TO BE ENCOURAGED ANDGOADED TO ENGAGE IN CREATIVE WORK. THEIR GROANS AND LAMENTS ECHO THROUGH THEAGES.THE CULTIVATION OF THE SPIRIT IS ELUSIVE AND DIFFICULT, AND THE TENDENCY TOWARDIT IS RARELY SPONTANEOUS. WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION ARE MANY, CULTURALCREATIVENESS IS LIKELY TO BE NEGLECTED.ACTION IS A HIGH ROAD TO SELF-CONFIDENCE AND ESTEEM. WHERE IT IS OPEN, ALLENERGIES FLOW TOWARD IT. IT COMES READILY TO MOST PEOPLE AND ITS REWARDS ARETANGIBLE. THE CULTIVATION OF THE SPIRIT IS ELUSIVE AND DIFFICULT, AND THETENDENCY TOWARD IT IS RARELY SPONTANEOUS. WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION AREMANY, CULTURAL CREATIVENESS IS LIKELY TO BE NEGLECTED. THE CULTURAL FLOWERING OFNEW ENGLAND CAME TO AN ALMOST ABRUPT END WITH THE OPENING OF THE WEST. THERELATIVE CULTURAL STERILITY OF THE ROMANS MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXPLAINED BY THEIREMPIRE RATHER THAN BY AN INNATE LACK OF GENIUS. THE BEST TALENTS WERE ATTRACTEDBY THE REWARDS OF ADMINISTRATIVE POSTS, JUST AS THE BEST TALENTS IN AMERICA AREATTRACTED BY THE REWARDS OF A BUSINESS CAREER.A FATEFUL PROCESS IS SET IN MOTION WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS RELEASED “TO THEFREEDOM OF HIS OWN IMPOTENCE” AND LEFT TO JUSTIFY HIS EXISTENCE BY HIS OWNEFFORTS. THE AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUAL, STRIVING TO REALIZE HIMSELF AND PROVE HISWORTH, HAS CREATED ALL THAT IS GREAT IN LITERATURE, ART, MUSIC, SCIENCE, ANDTECHNOLOGY. THE AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUAL, ALSO, WHEN HE CAN NEITHER REALIZE HIMSELFNOR JUSTIFY HIS EXISTENCE BY HIS OWN EFFORTS, IS A BREEDING OF FRUSTRATION, ANDTHE SEED OF THE CONVULSIONS THAT SHAKE OUR WORLD TO ITS FOUNDATIONS. THEINDIVIDUAL ON HIS OWN IS STABLE ONLY SO LONG AS HE IS POSSESSED OF SELF-ESTEEM.THE MAINTENANCE OF SELF-ESTEEM IS A CONTINUOUS TASK THAT TAXES ALL OF THEINDIVIDUAL’S POWER AND INNER RESOURCES. WE HAVE TO PROVE OUR WORTH AND JUSTIFYOUR EXISTENCE ANEW EACH DAY. WHEN, FOR WHATEVER REASON, SELF-ESTEEM ISUNATTAINABLE, THE AUTONOMOUS INDIVIDUAL BECOMES A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE ENTITY. HETURNS AWAY FROM AN UNPROMISING SELF AND PLUNGES INTO THE PURSUIT OF PRIDE—THEEXPLOSIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR SELF-ESTEEM. ALL SOCIAL DISTURBANCES AND UPHEAVALS HAVETHEIR ROOTS IN A CRISIS OF INDIVIDUAL SELF-ESTEEM, AND THE GREAT ENDEAVORS INWHICH THE MASSES MOST READILY UNITE IS BASICALLY A SEARCH FOR PRIDE.THE PROPENSITY TO ACTION IS SYMPTOMATIC OF AN INNER UNBALANCE. TO BE BALANCED ISTO BE MORE OR LESS AT REST. ACTION IS AT BOTTOM A SWINGING AND FLAILING OF THEARMS TO REGAIN ONE’S BALANCE AND KEEP AFLOAT.THE PROPENSITY TO ACTION IS SYMPTOMATIC OF AN INNER UNBALANCE. TO BE BALANCED ISTO BE MORE OR LESS AT REST. ACTION IS AT BOTTOM A SWINGING AND FLAILING OF THEARMS TO REGAIN ONE’S BALANCE AND KEEP AFLOAT. AND IF IT BE TRUE, AS NAPOLEONWROTE TO CARNOT, THAT “THE ART OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO LET MEN GROW STALE,” THENIT IS AN ART OF UNBALANCING. THE CRUCIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TOTALITARIANREGIME AND A FREE SOCIAL ORDER IS PERHAPS IN THE METHODS OF UNBALANCING BY WHICHTHE PEOPLE ARE KEPT ACTIVE AND STRIVING.WE ARE TOLD THAT TALENT CREATES ITS OWN OPPORTUNITIES. BUT IT SOMETIMES SEEMSTHAT INTENSE DESIRE CREATES NOT ONLY ITS OWN OPPORTUNITIES, BUT ITS OWN TALENTS.THE TIMES OF DRASTIC CHANGE ARE TIMES OF PASSION. WE CAN NEVER BE FIT AND READYFOR THAT WHICH IS WHOLLY NEW. WE HAVE TO ADJUST OURSELVES, AND EVERY RADICALADJUSTMENT IS A CRISIS IN SELF-ESTEEM: WE UNDERGO A TEST; WE HAVE TO PROVEOURSELVES. A POPULATION SUBJECTED TO DRASTIC CHANGE IS THUS A POPULATION OFMISFITS, AND MISFITS LIVE AND BREATHE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF PASSION.THAT WE PURSUE SOMETHING PASSIONATELY DOES NOT ALWAYS MEAN THAT WE REALLY WANTIT OR HAVE A SPECIAL APTITUDE FOR IT. OFTEN THE THING WE PURSUE MOSTPASSIONATELY IS BUT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE ONE THING WE REALLY WANT AND CANNOTHAVE. IT IS USUALLY SAFE TO PREDICT THAT THE FULFILLMENT OF AN EXCESSIVELYCHERISHED DESIRE IS NOT LIKELY TO STILL OUR NAGGING ANXIETY. IN EVERY PASSIONATEPURSUIT, THE PURSUIT COUNTS MORE THAN THE OBJECT PURSUED.HUMILITY IS NOT RENUNCIATION OF PRIDE BUT THE SUBSTITUTION OF ONE PRIDE FORANOTHER.IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS IMPULSIVE OR NATURAL TOLERANCE.TOLERANCE REQUIRES AN EFFORT OF THOUGHT AND SELF-CONTROL. AND ACTS OF KINDNESS,TOO, ARE RARELY WITHOUT DELIBERATENESS AND “THOUGHTFULNESS.” THUS IT SEEMS THATSOME ARTIFICIALITY, SOME POSING AND PRETENSE, ARE INSEPARABLE FROM ANY ACT ORATTITUDE THAT INVOLVES A LIMITATION OF OUR APPETITES AND SELFISHNESS. WE OUGHTTO BEWARE OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO PRETEND THAT THEY ARE GOODAND DECENT. LACK OF HYPOCRISY IN SUCH THINGS HINTS AT A CAPACITY FOR A MOSTDEPRAVED RUTHLESSNESS. (PRETENSE IS OFTEN AN INDISPENSABLE STEP IN THEATTAINMENT OF GENUINENESS. IT IS A FORM INTO WHICH GENUINE INCLINATIONS FLOW ANDSOLIDIFY.)THE CONTROL OF OUR BEING IS NOT UNLIKE THE COMBINATION OF A SAFE. ONE TURN OFTHE KNOB RARELY UNLOCKS THE SAFE. EACH ADVANCE AND RETREAT IS A STEP TOWARDONE’S GOAL.SECRETIVENESS CAN BE A SOURCE OF PRIDE. IT IS A PARADOX THAT SECRETIVENESS PLAYSTHE SAME ROLE AS BOASTING: IN BOTH WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE CREATION OF A DISGUISE.BOASTING TRIES TO CREATE AN IMAGINARY SELF, WHILE SECRETIVENESS GIVES US THEEXHILARATING FEELING OF BEING PRINCES DISGUISED IN MEEKNESS. OF THE TWO,SECRETIVENESS IS THE MORE DIFFICULT AND EFFECTIVE, FOR IN THE SELF-OBSERVANTBOASTING BREEDS SELF-CONTEMPT. YET IT IS AS SPINOZA SAID: “MEN GOVERN NOTHINGWITH MORE DIFFICULTY THAN THEIR TONGUES, AND CAN MODERATE THEIR DESIRES MORETHAN THEIR WORDS.”TO BECOME DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ARE, WE MUST HAVE SOME AWARENESS OF WHAT WEARE. WHETHER BEING DIFFERENT RESULTS IN DIS-SIMULATION OR A REAL CHANGE OFHEART—IT CANNOT BE REALIZED WITHOUT SELF-AWARENESS. YET IT IS REMARKABLE THATTHE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST SELF-DISSATISFIED AND CRAVE MOST FOR A NEW IDENTITYHAVE THE LEAST SELF-AWARENESS. THEY HAVE TURNED AWAY FROM AN UNWANTED SELF ANDHENCE NEVER HAD A GOOD LOOK AT IT. THE RESULT IS THAT THOSE MOST DISSATISFIEDCAN NEITHER DISSIMULATE NOR ATTAIN A REAL CHANGE OF HEART. THEY ARE TRANSPARENT,AND THEIR UNWANTED QUALITIES PERSIST THROUGH ALL ATTEMPTS AT SELF-DRAMATIZATIONAND SELF-TRANSFORMATION.SOURCE: BRUCE LEE’S HANDWRITTEN ESSAY ENTITLED “THE PASSIONATE STATE OF MIND.”BRUCE LEE PAPERS."},{"pageContent":"PART 8LETTERSImage [../Images/c2.jpg][../Images/246a.jpg]THROUGHOUT HIS LIFETIME, BRUCE LEE WAS A VERY PROLIFIC LETTER WRITER.

IT CONTAINS MY DREAMS AND MY WAYS OFTHINKING. AS A WHOLE, YOU CAN CALL IT MY WAY OF LIFE. IT WILL BE RATHERCONFUSING AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO WRITE DOWN EXACTLY HOW I FEEL. YET I WANT TOWRITE AND LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. I’LL DO MY BEST TO WRITE IT CLEARLY AND I HOPETHAT YOU, TOO, WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN THIS LETTER, AND DON’T ARRIVE AT ANYCONCLUSIONS TILL YOU ARE FINISHED.THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF MAKING A GOOD LIVING. ONE IS THE RESULT OF HARD WORK, ANDTHE OTHER, THE RESULT OF THE IMAGINATION (REQUIRES WORK, TOO, OF COURSE). IT ISA FACT THAT LABOR AND THRIFT PRODUCE A COMPETENCE, BUT FORTUNE, IN THE SENSE OFWEALTH, IS THE REWARD OF THE MAN WHO CAN THINK OF SOMETHING THAT HASN’T BEENTHOUGHT OF BEFORE. IN EVERY INDUSTRY, IN EVERY PROFESSION, IDEAS ARE WHATAMERICA IS LOOKING FOR. IDEAS HAVE MADE AMERICA WHAT SHE IS, AND ONE GOOD IDEAWILL MAKE A MAN WHAT HE WANTS TO BE.[../Images/247a.jpg]ONE PART OF MY LIFE IS GUNG FU. THIS ART HAS BEEN A GREAT INFLUENCE IN THEFORMATION OF MY CHARACTER AND IDEAS. I PRACTICE GUNG FU AS A PHYSICAL CULTURE, AFORM OF MENTAL TRAINING, A METHOD OF SELFDEFENSE, AND A WAY OF LIFE. GUNG FU ISTHE BEST OF ALL MARTIAL ART; YET THE CHINESE DERIVATIVES OF JUDO AND KARATE,WHICH ARE ONLY BASICS OF GUNG FU, ARE FLOURISHING ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES.THIS SO HAPPENS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS [YET] HEARD OF THIS SUPREME ART; ALSO THEREARE NO COMPETENT INSTRUCTORS. I BELIEVE MY LONG YEARS OF PRACTICE BACK UP MYTITLE TO BECOME THE FIRST INSTRUCTOR OF THIS MOVEMENT. THERE ARE YET LONG YEARSAHEAD OF ME TO POLISH MY TECHNIQUES AND CHARACTER. MY AIM, THEREFORE, IS TOESTABLISH A FIRST GUNG FU INSTITUTE THAT WILL LATER SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THEUNITED STATES (I HAVE SET A TIME LIMIT OF TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS TO COMPLETE THEWHOLE PROJECT).MY REASON IN DOING THIS IS NOT THE SOLE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING MONEY. THE MOTIVESARE MANY AND AMONG THEM ARE: I LIKE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT THE GREATNESS OFTHIS CHINESE ART; I ENJOY TEACHING AND HELPING PEOPLE; I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AWELL-TO-DO HOME FOR MY FAMILY; I LIKE TO ORIGINATE SOMETHING; AND THE LAST BUTYET ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE GUNG FU IS PART OF MYSELF.I KNOW MY IDEA IS RIGHT, AND, THEREFORE, THE RESULTS WOULD BE SATISFACTORY. IDON’T REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE REWARD, BUT TO SET IN MOTION THE MACHINERY TOACHIEVE IT. MY CONTRIBUTION WILL BE THE MEASURE OF MY REWARD AND SUCCESS.BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY, SOME ASKED THE LATE DR. CHARLES P. STEINMETZ, THEELECTRICAL GENIUS, IN HIS OPINION “WHAT BRANCH OF SCIENCE WOULD MAKE THE MOSTPROGRESS IN THE NEXT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS?” HE PAUSED AND THOUGHT FOR SEVERALMINUTES THEN LIKE A FLASH REPLIED, “SPIRITUAL REALIZATION.” WHEN MAN COMES TO ACONSCIOUS VITAL REALIZATION OF THOSE GREAT SPIRITUAL FORCES WITHIN HIMSELF ANDBEGINS TO USE THOSE FORCES IN SCIENCE, IN BUSINESS, AND IN LIFE, HIS PROGRESS INTHE FUTURE WILL BE UNPARALLELED.I FEEL I HAVE THIS GREAT CREATIVE AND SPIRITUAL FORCE WITHIN ME THAT IS GREATERTHAN FAITH, GREATER THAN AMBITION, GREATER THAN CONFIDENCE, GREATER THANDETERMINATION, GREATER THAN VISION. IT IS ALL THESE COMBINED. MY BRAIN BECOMESMAGNETIZED WITH THIS DOMINATING FORCE WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND.WHEN YOU DROP A PEBBLE INTO A POOL OF WATER, THE PEBBLE STARTS A SERIES OFRIPPLES THAT EXPAND UNTIL THEY ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE POOL. THIS IS EXACTLY WHATWILL HAPPEN WHEN I GIVE MY IDEAS A DEFINITE PLAN OF ACTION. RIGHT NOW, I CANPROJECT MY THOUGHTS INTO THE FUTURE, I CAN SEE AHEAD OF ME. I DREAM (REMEMBERTHAT PRACTICAL DREAMERS NEVER QUIT). I MAY NOW OWN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE PLACEDOWN IN A BASEMENT, BUT ONCE MY IMAGINATION HAS GOT UP A FULL HEAD OF STEAM, ICAN SEE PAINTED ON A CANVAS OF MY MIND A PICTURE OF A FINE, BIG FIVE- ORSIX-STORY GUNG FU INSTITUTE WITH BRANCHES ALL OVER THE STATES. I AM NOT EASILYDISCOURAGED, READILY VISUALIZE MYSELF AS OVERCOMING OBSTACLES, WINNING OUT OVERSETBACKS, ACHIEVING “IMPOSSIBLE” OBJECTIVES.WHETHER IT IS THE GOD-HEAD OR NOT, I FEEL THIS GREAT FORCE, THIS UNTAPPED POWER,THIS DYNAMIC SOMETHING WITHIN ME. THIS FEELING DEFIES DESCRIPTION, AND [THEREIS] NO EXPERIENCE WITH WHICH THIS FEELING MAY BE COMPARED. IT IS SOMETHING LIKEA STRONG EMOTION MIXED WITH FAITH, BUT A LOT STRONGER.ALL IN ALL, THE GOAL OF MY PLANNING AND DOING IS TO FIND THE TRUE MEANING INLIFE—PEACE OF MIND. I KNOW THAT THE SUM OF ALL THE POSSESSIONS I MENTIONED DOESNOT NECESSARILY ADD UP TO PEACE OF MIND; HOWEVER, IT CAN IF I DEVOTE MYSELF TOREAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SELF RATHER THAN NEUROTIC COMBAT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVETHIS PEACE OF MIND, THE TEACHING OF DETACHMENT OF TAOISM AND ZEN WILL PROVE TOBE VALUABLE.PROBABLY, PEOPLE WILL SAY I’M TOO CONSCIOUS OF SUCCESS. WELL, I AM NOT. YOU SEE,MY WILL TO DO SPRINGS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I CAN DO. I’M ONLY BEING NATURAL,FOR THERE IS NO FEAR OR DOUBT INSIDE MY MIND.PEARL, SUCCESS COMES TO THOSE WHO BECOME SUCCESS-CONSCIOUS.

AS I’VE MENTIONED, I’VE JUSTGOT BACK FROM OAKLAND, AND JAMES LEE IS GOING TO SEND YOU A LOP SAO APPARATUSWITH BUILT-IN RESISTANCE.[../Images/250a.jpg]FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WOULD LIKE TO IMPRESS A MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF TEACHING INYOUR MIND, AND THAT IS THE ECONOMY OF FORM. FOLLOW THIS RULE AND YOU WILL NEVERFEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE AND MORE SO-CALLED “SIZZLING” TECHNIQUES TO KEEPYOUR STUDENTS INTERESTED.IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN “ECONOMY OF FORM,” I’LL TAKE A TECHNIQUE TO ILLUSTRATE THETHEORY. LATER ON THIS IDEA CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY TECHNIQUE. TOGETHER WITH THEIDEA OF “THE THREE STAGES OF A TECHNIQUE” ([1] SYNCHRONIZATION OF SELF, [2]SYNCHRONIZATION WITH OPPONENT, [3] UNDER FIGHTING CONDITION) THIS PROGRAM OFTEACHING NOT ONLY PROVIDES AN ENDLESS ROUTINE OF INSTRUCTION, BUT A MOSTEFFICIENT LESSON PLAN THAT WILL BRING RESULTS TO ALL STUDENTS. I’VE TESTED THEMHERE IN LA AND DISREGARDING HOW LITTLE WE SHOW EACH TIME, THE STUDENTS’ INTERESTIS KEPT UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE EXTRA MOTIONS INVOLVED, AND THEYFEEL GREAT DOING IT. ALL RIGHT, BACK TO THE IDEA OF “ECONOMY OF FORM.”TO ILLUSTRATE THE IDEA, I’LL TAKE THE PAK SAO (SLAPPING HAND)— BASICALLY,“ECONOMY OF MOTION” MEANS ALL MOTIONS START FROM THE BY-JONG POSITION; SECONDLY,HANDS ARE TO MOVE FIRST IF IT IS A HAND TECHNIQUE (FOOT FOLLOWS), FEET FIRST IFIT IS A FOOT TECHNIQUE.SO EMPHASIZE THE ABOVE “TWO TRUTHS” BY PRACTICING PAK SAO FIRST IN THE TOUCHINGHAND MANNER—IN OTHER WORDS, STUDENTS IN BAI-JONG POSITION TOUCHING EACH OTHER’SHAND—THOUGH IN REAL COMBAT, ONE WILL NEVER START BY TOUCHING HAND; HOWEVER, THISTOUCHING HAND POSITION WILL ENSURE CORRECT FORM IN THE BEGINNING STAGE—ECONOMYOF FORM, THAT IS.EACH STUDENT MUST ATTACK [IN UNISON] FROM THE BAI-JONG WITHOUT ANY WASTEDMOTION. NOW THIS HAS BEEN AN OVERLOOKED BASIC THEORY OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IFANY STUDENT DOES HIS PAK SAO [OR ANY TECHNIQUE FOR THAT MATTER] WITH WASTEDMOTION, BACK TO THE TOUCHING HAND POSITION HE GOES TO MINIMIZE HIS UNNECESSARYMOTIONS. SO YOU SEE THAT IN ORDER TO PROGRESS TO APPLY PAK SAO FROM A DISTANCE,THIS TOUCHING HAND POSITION HAS TO BE MASTERED. NOT ONLY THAT, THE STUDENT HASTO RETURN TO THE TOUCHING HAND POSITION TO REMIND HIM TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARYMOTION PERIODICALLY.FROM A DISTANCE, PAK SAO IS A LOT HARDER—WITHOUT ANY GIVEN AWAY MOTION, ONE MUSTINITIATE FIRST HAND, THEN FEET, IN A PROGRESSIVE, HARMONIOUS FORWARD MOTION—NOWONDER NOT TOO MANY CAN HIT WITH A SINGLE PAK SAO! DO YOU NOT SEE NOW THE IDEAOF ECONOMY OF MOTION? JUST THIS ONE THEORY OF ECONOMY OF MOTION TAKES UP ONEHECK OF A LOT OF TIME FOR PERFECTION, NOT TO MENTION THE “THREE STAGES OF ATECHNIQUE”—THAT IS, IN TERMS OF PAK SAO—AND AFTER LEARNING AND MASTERING PAK SAOFROM A DISTANCE, ONE HAS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN [ONE AND ONE’S] OPPONENT WITHA KICK—TO CLOSE IN SAFELY.FOLLOWING THE ABOVE SUGGESTION WILL GIVE YOU ENDLESS HOURS OF INSTRUCTION. OFCOURSE, YOU MUST USE THE SET SYSTEM, THAT IS REPETITION OF EACH TECHNIQUE INSETS FOR PERFECTION. YOU BEGIN NOW IMMEDIATELY TO WORK ON WHAT I MENTIONED ANDAPPLY ALL YOU’VE LEARNED WITH ECONOMY OF MOTION—YOU WILL DOUBLE YOUR SPEED ANDSKILL DOING JUST THAT.I HOPE I HAVE IMPRESSED IN YOUR MIND A MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF OUR STYLE—STICK TOTHE PROGRAM I’VE GIVEN YOU, USE VARIETY, AND DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH THAT YOURSTUDENTS NEED MORE AND MORE TO STAY WITH YOU—TRUE [ONLY] IF THEY CAN DOPERFECTLY ALL YOU’VE TAUGHT THEM.REMEMBER THE IDEA THAT ONE HAS TO COME IN THOUSANDS OF TIMES IN ORDER TO PERFECTONE JUDO THROW.

I’VE JUST BEEN BACK FROM A DUBBINGSESSION—BUSY IS THE WORD!SINCERITY SEEMS TO BE PART OF YOUR MAKEUP AND THOUGH WE’VE NOT BEEN TOGETHER FORTOO LONG, MY IMMEDIATE REPLY TO YOU IS AS FOLLOWS: (A) TIMEWISE I WOULDN’T HAVETIME TO TEACH, BUT I’M WILLING— WHEN TIME PERMITS—TO HONESTLY EXPRESS OR “TOOPEN MYSELF” TO YOU, TO ACT AS SORT OF A SIGN POLE FOR A TRAVELER.MY EXPERIENCE WILL HELP, BUT I INSIST AND MAINTAIN THAT ART— TRUE ART, THATIS—CANNOT BE HANDED OUT. FURTHERMORE, ART IS NEVER DECORATION OR EMBELLISHMENT.INSTEAD IT IS A CONSTANT PROCESS OF MATURING (IN THE SENSE OF NOT HAVINGARRIVED!).YOU SEE, JOHN, WHEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING OUT, YOU’LL SEE THAT YOURWAY OF THINKING IS DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS MINE. ART, AFTER ALL, IS A MEANSOF ACQUIRING “PERSONAL” LIBERTY. YOUR WAY IS NOT MY WAY NOR MINE YOURS.SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET TOGETHER, REMEMBER WELL THAT ART “LIVES” WHEREABSOLUTE FREEDOM IS. WITH ALL THE TRAINING THROWN TO NOWHERE, WITH A MIND (IFTHERE IS SUCH A VERBAL SUBSTANCE) PERFECTLY UNAWARE OF ITS OWN WORKING, WITH THE“SELF” VANISHING NOWHERE THE ART OF JKD ATTAINS ITS PERFECTION.I HAVE TO HIT THE SACK NOW ’CAUSE I HAVE TO WORK EARLY TOMORROW PLUS TRAININGAFTERWARD.
