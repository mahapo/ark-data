The company’sfounder, Charles E. Tuttle, belonged to a New England family steeped inpublishing. And his first love was naturally books—especially old and rareeditions.Immediately after II, serving in Tokyo under General Douglas MacArthur, Tuttlewas tasked with reviving the Japanese publishing industry, and founded theCharles E. Tuttle Publishing Company, which thrives today as one of the world’sleading independent publishers.Though a westerner, Charles was hugely instrumental in bringing a knowledge ofJapan and Asia to a world hungry for information about the East. By the time ofhis death in 1993, Tuttle had published over 6,000 books on Asian culture,history and art—a legacy honored by the Japanese emperor with the “Order of theSacred Treasure,” the highest tribute Japan can bestow upon a non-Japanese.With a backlist of over 1,500 titles, Tuttle Publishing is more active todaythan at any time in its past—inspired by Charles’ core mission to publish finebooks to span the East and West and provide a greater understanding of each."},{"pageContent":"ALL PHOTOS APPEARING IN THIS BOOK ARE COURTESY OF THE ARCHIVE OF LINDA LEECADWELL, THE ESTATE OF BRUCE LEE, AND WARNER BROTHERS FILMS.PUBLISHED IN 1998 BY TUTTLE PUBLISHING, AN IMPRINT OF PERIPLUS EDITIONS (HK)LTD.WWW.TUTTLEPUBLISHING.COM [http://www.tuttlepublishing.com]COPYRIGHT© 1998 LINDA LEE CADWELLALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

LIKE THE JOURNALS AND PRIVATE PAPERS OF THE CLASSICGOSSIPS AND DIARISTS—PEPYS, BOSWELL, SAINT-SIMON—THE FUNCTION OF LETTERS IS “TOREVEAL TO US THE LITTLENESS UNDERLYING GREAT EVENTS AND TO REMIND US THATHISTORY ONCE WAS REAL LIFE.” FOR IT IS IN LETTERS THAT HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHYMEET, TO FORM THE MOST INTIMATE OF ALL FORMS OF LITERATURE.SOME HAVE SAID THAT THE THEATER IS WHAT LITERATURE DOES AT NIGHT. IF SO, THENLETTERS ARE WHAT THE CREATORS OF SUCH LITERATURE DO AND THINK IN THE EVENING OFTHEIR THOUGHTS. FOR IT IS THERE, IN THE DARKENED, INNERMOST RECESSES OF ONE'SMIND, WELL BEHIND THE GLARE OF SUPERFICIALITY AND TRIVIA, THAT OUR PASSIONS,DESIRES, AND TRUEST SELVES RESIDE. G. K.

THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE PATIENT UNTIL THE BLESSINGMANIFESTS ITSELF AND THEN TO HAVE THE WISDOM TO RECOGNIZE THAT A BLESSING HASBEEN BESTOWED.THE “ADVERSITY” THAT WAS A CONSTANT COMPANION FOR MOST OF THE FIFTEEN YEARSCOVERED BY THESE LETTERS WAS SIMPLY LACK OF FUNDS TO COVER THE COST OFLONG-DISTANCE PHONE CALLS. UP UNTIL THE LAST YEAR OR SO OF HIS LIFE, BRUCE WASPRODDED BY NECESSITY TO COMMUNICATE HIS THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS IN WRITING—INLETTERS TO FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND ASSOCIATES—AND WHAT A BLESSING THIS HAS TURNEDOUT TO BE! INSTEAD OF HAZY RECOLLECTIONS OF CONVERSATIONS, WE HAVE A COLLECTIONOF ARTFUL WRITINGS BY A MAN DEDICATED TO HONEST SELF-EXPRESSION. IN HIS FILMS,THE WORLD HAS SEEN BRUCE LEE EXPRESS HIMSELF THROUGH HIS “MARTIAL” ART. IN THISCOLLECTION, WE GLIMPSE THE PRIVATE SIDE OF BRUCE’S ELOQUENCE AS HE BARES HISSOUL THROUGH THE ART OF LETTER WRITING.Image [../Images/10a.jpg]I FEEL MOST FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF MANY OF BRUCE’S HEARTFELTEXPRESSIONS. A WAVE OF NOSTALGIA WASHES OVER ME AS I RELIVE THROUGH HIS LETTERSTHE SMALL BITS OF OUR EVERYDAY LIFE TOGETHER, PUNCTUATED BY MOMENTOUS,DESTINY-CHANGING EVENTS. BRUCE’S LETTERS REFLECT THE COURSE OF FAMILY LIFE—LOTSOF LITTLE BUSINESS, LIKE WHO’S TAKING CARE OF THE DOG, WHAT TIME DOES A FLIGHTARRIVE—INTERSPERSED WITH SIGNIFICANT DRAMA THAT SHAPES DIRECTION AND GROWTH—THEBIRTH OF A CHILD, THE DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER. NOT SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOSTPEOPLE’S LIVES, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING THAT IS EVIDENT IN THESE LETTERS—PATTERNS.PATTERNS THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK FOR AS YOU READ BRUCE’SLETTERS. WHAT ARE THE CENTRAL THEMES THAT EMERGE FROM BRUCE’S ARTFULEXPRESSIONS? CAN YOU SPOT AN IDEA EMERGING FROM BRUCE’S PEN LIKE A BUTTERFLYESCAPING A COCOON? CAN YOU WATCH THE IDEA SPREAD ITS WINGS AND TAKE FLIGHT? CANYOU OBSERVE THE IDEA, PERHAPS NOW IN A NEW FORM, AS IT COMES TO REST ON A HIGHERRUNG OF THE LADDER OF HUMAN MATURATION? AN INTELLIGENTPLAN—IMPLEMENTATION—REALIZATION. THIS WAS BRUCE. THIS IS HOW HE MADE HIS DREAMSCOME TRUE.IN BRUCE’S OWN WORDS, HERE IS A SAMPLING OF THE PATTERNS OR CENTRAL IDEAS TOLOOK FOR IN HIS LETTERS:• GUNG FU IS PART OF MY LIFE—THE ART INFLUENCES MY FORMATION OF CHARACTER ANDIDEAS.• THE GOAL OF MY PLANNING AND DOING IS TO FIND THE TRUE MEANING IN LIFE—PEACE OFMIND.• NEVER WASTE ENERGY ON WORRIES OR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS.• IT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS THAT IS SUCCESS OR FAILURE, BUT WHAT IT DOES TO THEHEART OF MAN. NO MAN IS DEFEATED UNLESS HE IS DISCOURAGED.• WHAT I HONESTLY VALUE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS QUALITY: DOING ONE’S BEST INTHE MANNER OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CRAFTSMANSHIP OF A NUMBER ONE.• THIS DILIGENTLY TRAINED BODY PLUS A TIME-TRIED REALISTIC FAITH IN KNOWING THATI CAN.• IT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR LIFE THAT IS IMPORTANT, IT’S HOW WE REACT TOWHAT HAPPENS.THIS LAST STATEMENT HAS FORMED A CREDO IN MY OWN LIFE, ESPECIALLY THROUGH TIMESOF UNBEARABLE SADNESS. SOMETIMES LIFE IS NICE, SOMETIMES IT IS NOT. BUT IT ISTHE WAY THAT WE CHOOSE TO REACT TO THE NICE AND THE NOT-SO-NICE THAT ULTIMATELYDETERMINES OUR CHARACTERS.ONE’S LIFE IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF CHOICE, THE CHOICES WE MAKE IN RESPONSE TO WHATHAPPENS TO US. TAKE NOTE OF BRUCE’S CHOICES IN HIS LIFE AND THE PROCESS HEEMPLOYED TO MAKE THOSE CHOICES. KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE LETTERS REPRESENT ONLY ASNAPSHOT OF THE UNDERLYING INTELLIGENCE OF THE AUTHOR. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEESSAYS, NOTES, CONVERSATIONS, AND INTERVIEWS CONTAINED IN OTHER BOOKS IN THEBRUCE LEE LIBRARY, THE TOTAL PICTURE OF A THIRY-TWO-YEAR-OLD, HIGHLY EVOLVEDHUMAN BEING EMERGES.“LIFE, IF THOU KNOWEST HOW TO USE IT, IS LONG ENOUGH,” THE ROMAN PHILOSOPHERSENECA ONCE WROTE. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BRUCE KNEW HOW BEST TO USE THESHORT LIFE HE WAS GRANTED; WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS LONG ENOUGH IS NOT IN OUR POWERTO DETERMINE.—LINDA LEE CADWELLPOSTSCRIPTBRUCE’S NATIVE LANGUAGE WAS CANTONESE. HE BEGAN TO STUDY SPOKEN AND WRITTENENGLISH AT AGE TWELVE. THERE IS A FUNNY STORY ABOUT THE FIRST DAY BRUCE ATTENDEDA SCHOOL WHERE ENGLISH WAS SPOKEN. THE STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO WRITE THEIRENGLISH NAMES. NOT UNDERSTANDING THE ASSIGNMENT, BRUCE LOOKED AT HIS NEIGHBOR’SPAPER AND WROTE THAT BOY’S NAME.THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE, BRUCE THOUGHT PRIMARILY IN CHINESE. HE EVEN DREAMED INCHINESE. HIS GRASP OF ENGLISH, HOWEVER, WAS EXCELLENT. HE MADE A DELIBERATESTUDY OF CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH—AN EMERGING PATTERN OF SELF-EDUCATION—AND HISLIBRARY INCLUDES NUMEROUS BOOKS ON ENGLISH IDIOMS AND EXPRESSIONS. BRUCE’SABILITY TO WRITE PERFECT GRAMMATICAL ENGLISH WAS UNSURPASSED. HE ONCE WROTE APAPER FOR ME IN MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE BECAUSE I WAS GETTING BEHIND IN MYASSIGNMENTS (A DIRECT RESULT OF BEING DISTRACTED BY BRUCE).YOU WILL NOT ALWAYS READ PERFECT GRAMMATICAL ENGLISH IN HIS LETTERS BECAUSE,EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THE PROPER RULES BETTER THAN MOST NATIVE SPEAKERS OFENGLISH, HE DID NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE TIME TO CONSTRUCT PERFECT SENTENCES INCASUAL CORRESPONDENCE. BRUCE’S THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS SPILLED OUT ONTO THE PAPERAS, IN CHINESE, HIS MIND FLOWED AS NATURALLY AS THE WATERFALL TUMBLES OVER THEPRECIPICE.I WILL GIVE YOU MY HEART, PLEASE DON’T GIVE ME YOUR HEAD ONLY.—BRUCE LEEABSORB BRUCE’S LETTERS THROUGH THE WALLS OF YOUR HEART, NOT THROUGH THE MENTALPROCESS OF YOUR HEAD.—LINDA LEE CADWELL"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONYOU ARE HOLDING IN YOUR HANDS THE LITERARY EQUIVALENT OF BRUCE LEE’S PRIVATEPHOTO ALBUM.

LATER ON, I EXCHANGED MY HONG KONGDOLLARS AND BOUGHT A PAIR OF SHOES (VERY LOW PRICE), THREE THICK TERRY-CLOTHSHIRTS AND SOME SCENIC PHOTOS. LATER ON, THEY TOOK ME TO LISTEN TO A MUSICLOUNGE.

WE CHIT-CHATTED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN I DECIDED TO PEN YOUTHIS LETTER.NOW THE BOAT HAS PULLED OUT, SO I WILL PUT AWAY MY PEN. THE REASON IS BECAUSEWHEN THE BOAT IS SAILING, THE OCEAN HAS BECOME ROUGH WITH BIG WAVES AND THE SHIPIS VERY ROCKY—TO THE POINT IN THE EVENING THERE WAS A DANCE, BUT NOBODY COULDDANCE AS LIQUOR BOTTLES WERE FALLING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

IKNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM OTHER THAN THAT HE TOLD ME HE HAS COLLECTED THOUSANDSUPON THOUSANDS OF L.P RECORDS. I RESORTED TO SAYING THAT IN HONG KONG, I ALSOLISTENED TO A LOT OF ALBUMS. HE ALSO COMPLAINED OF HIS OWN SHORTCOMING OF BEINGHARD TO GET ALONG WITH, AND HOW HIS MISTRESS HAD SOLD HIS SHATIN11[../Text/Part1.xhtml#aa11] VACATION HOUSE, ETC. THEN HE PROCEEDED TO ASK ABOUTTHE WELL BEING OF PAPA. HE SAID THAT IN THE FUTURE HE WOULD RETURN TO HONG KONG,GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. BUT THIS INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT TRUST ANYBODY AT ALL. HEHANDLES ALL HIS BUSINESS PERSONALLY. WHY WOULD HE EVER LEAVE THE WHOLE BUSINESSBEHIND FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO MANAGE?THAT EVENING, THEY ALSO INTRODUCED ME TO A MR. TANG. THIS MR.

IT CONTAINS MY DREAMS AND MY WAYS OFTHINKING. AS A WHOLE, YOU CAN CALL IT MY WAY OF LIFE. IT WILL BE RATHERCONFUSING AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO WRITE DOWN EXACTLY HOW I FEEL. YET I WANT TOWRITE AND LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. I’LL DO MY BEST TO WRITE IT CLEARLY AND I HOPETHAT YOU, TOO, WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND IN THIS LETTER, AND DON’T ARRIVE AT ANYCONCLUSIONS TILL YOU ARE FINISHED.GUNG FU IS THE BEST OF ALL MARTIAL ART; YET THE CHINESE DERIVATIVES OF JUDO ANDKARATE, WHICH ARE ONLY BASICS OF GUNG FU, ARE FLOURISHING ALL OVER THE U.S....BECAUSE NO ONE HAS HEARD OF THIS SUPREME ART [AND] THERE ARE NO COMPETENTINSTRUCTORS .... I BELIEVE MY LONG YEARS OF PRACTICE BACK UP MY TITLE TO BECOMETHE FIRST INSTRUCTOR OF THIS MOVEMENTTHERE ARE TWO WAYS OF MAKING A GOOD LIVING. ONE IS THE RESULT OF HARD WORKING,AND THE OTHER, THE RESULT OF THE IMAGINATION (REQUIRES WORK, TOO, OF COURSE). ITIS A FACT THAT LABOR AND THRIFT PRODUCE A COMPETENCE, BUT FORTUNE, IN THE SENSEOF WEALTH, IS THE REWARD OF THE MAN WHO CAN THINK OF SOMETHING THAT HASN’T BEENTHOUGHT OF BEFORE. IN EVERY INDUSTRY, IN EVERY PROFESSION, IDEAS ARE WHATAMERICA IS LOOKING FOR. IDEAS HAVE MADE AMERICA WHAT SHE IS, AND ONE GOOD IDEAWILL MAKE A MAN WHAT HE WANTS TO BE.ONE PART OF MY LIFE IS GUNG FU. THIS ART INFLUENCES [ME] GREATLY IN THEFORMATION OF MY CHARACTER AND IDEAS. I PRACTICE GUNG FU AS A PHYSICAL CULTURE, AFORM OF MENTAL TRAINING, A METHOD OF SELF-DEFENSE, AND A WAY OF LIFE. GUNG FU ISTHE BEST OF ALL MARTIAL ART; YET THE CHINESE DERIVATIVES OF JUDO AND KARATE,WHICH ARE ONLY BASICS OF GUNG FU, ARE FLOURISHING ALL OVER THE U.S. THIS SOHAPPENS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS HEARD OF THIS SUPREME ART; ALSO THERE ARE NOCOMPETENT INSTRUCTORS... I BELIEVE MY LONG YEARS OF PRACTICE BACK UP MY TITLE TOBECOME THE FIRST INSTRUCTOR OF THIS MOVEMENT. THERE ARE YET LONG YEARS AHEAD OFME TO POLISH MY TECHNIQUES AND CHARACTER. MY AIM, THEREFORE, IS TO ESTABLISH AFIRST GUNG FU INSTITUTE THAT WILL LATER SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE U.S. (I HAVE SETA TIME LIMIT OF 10 TO 15 YEARS TO COMPLETE THE WHOLE PROJECT). MY REASON INDOING THIS IS NOT THE SOLE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING MONEY. THE MOTIVES ARE MANY ANDAMONG THEM ARE: I LIKE TO LET THE WORLD KNOW ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF THIS CHINESEART; I ENJOY TEACHING AND HELPING PEOPLE; I LIKE TO HAVE A WELL-TO-DO HOME FORMY FAMILY; I LIKE TO ORIGINATE SOMETHING; AND THE LAST BUT YET ONE OF THE MOSTIMPORTANT IS BECAUSE GUNG FU IS PART OF MYSELF.I KNOW MY IDEA IS RIGHT, AND, THEREFORE, THE RESULTS WOULD BE SATISFACTORY. IDON’T REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE REWARD, BUT TO SET IN MOTION THE MACHINERY TOACHIEVE IT. MY CONTRIBUTION WILL BE THE MEASURE OF MY REWARD AND SUCCESS.BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY, SOME ASKED THE LATE DR. CHARLES E STEINMETZ, THEELECTRICAL GENIUS, IN HIS OPINION “WHAT BRANCH OF SCIENCE WOULD MAKE THE MOSTPROGRESS IN THE NEXT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS?” HE PAUSED AND THOUGHT FOR SEVERALMINUTES THEN LIKE A FLASH REPLIED, “SPIRITUAL REALIZATION?” WHEN MAN COMES TO ACONSCIOUS VITAL REALIZATION OF THOSE GREAT SPIRITUAL FORCES WITHIN HIMSELF ANDBEGINS TO USE THOSE FORCES IN SCIENCE, IN BUSINESS, AND IN LIFE, HIS PROGRESS INTHE FUTURE WILL BE UNPARALLELED.I FEEL I HAVE THIS GREAT CREATIVE AND SPIRITUAL FORCE WITHIN ME THAT IS GREATERTHAN FAITH, GREATER THAN AMBITION, GREATER THAN CONFIDENCE, GREATER THANDETERMINATION, GREATER THAN VISION. IT IS ALL THESE COMBINED. MY BRAIN BECOMESMAGNETIZED WITH THIS DOMINATING FORCE WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND.WHEN YOU DROP A PEBBLE INTO A POOL OF WATER, THE PEBBLE STARTS A SERIES OFRIPPLES THAT EXPAND UNTIL THEY ENCOMPASS THE WHOLE POOL. THIS IS EXACTLY WHATWILL HAPPEN WHEN I GIVE MY IDEAS A DEFINITE PLAN OF ACTION. RIGHT NOW, I CANPROJECT MY THOUGHTS INTO THE FUTURE, I CAN SEE AHEAD OF ME. I DREAM (REMEMBERTHAT PRACTICAL DREAMERS NEVER QUIT). I MAY NOW OWN NOTHING BUT A LITTLE PLACEDOWN IN A BASEMENT, BUT ONCE MY IMAGINATION HAS GOT UP A FULL HEAD OF STEAM, ICAN SEE PAINTED ON A CANVAS OF MY MIND A PICTURE OF A FINE, BIG FIVE OR SIXSTORY GUNG FU INSTITUTE WITH BRANCHES ALL OVER THE STATES. I AM NOT EASILYDISCOURAGED, READILY VISUALIZE MYSELF AS OVERCOMING OBSTACLES, WINNING OUT OVERSETBACKS, ACHIEVING “IMPOSSIBLE” OBJECTIVES.Image [../Images/31a.jpg]LEE SEEMED ALWAYS TO HAVE A PEN IN HIS HAND—EVEN DURING THE FILMING OF ENTER THEDRAGON.WHETHER IT IS THE GOD-HEAD OR NOT, I FEEL THIS GREAT FORCE, THIS UNTAPPED POWER,THIS DYNAMIC SOMETHING WITHIN ME. THIS FEELING DEFIES DESCRIPTION, AND [THEREIS] NO EXPERIENCE WITH WHICH THIS FEELING MAY BE COMPARED. IT IS SOMETHING LIKEA STRONG EMOTION MIXED WITH FAITH, BUT A LOT STRONGER.ALL IN ALL, THE GOAL OF MY PLANNING AND DOING IS TO FIND THE TRUE MEANING INLIFE—PEACE OF MIND. I KNOW THAT THE SUM OF ALL POSSESSIONS I MENTIONED DOES NOTNECESSARILY ADD UP TO PEACE OF MIND; HOWEVER, IT CAN BE IF I DEVOTE [MY ENERGY]TO REAL ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SELF RATHER THAN NEUROTIC COMBAT. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVETHIS PEACE OF MIND, THE TEACHING OF DETACHMENT OF TAOISM AND ZEN PROVED TO BEVALUABLE ....PROBABLY, PEOPLE WILL SAY I’M TOO CONSCIOUS OF SUCCESS. WELL, I AM NOT. YOU SEE,MY WILL TO DO SPRINGS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I CAN DO. I’M ONLY BEING NATURAL,FOR THERE IS NO FEAR OR DOUBT INSIDE MY MIND.PEARL, SUCCESS COMES TO THOSE WHO BECOME SUCCESS-CONSCIOUS.

IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHOM BRUCE LEE ADDRESSED THISLETTER AS ALL THAT REMAINS IS HIS FIRST DRAFT. HOWEVER; GIVEN THAT HE WAS INSAINT FRANCIS XAVIER HIGH SCHOOL WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN, AND UPON CHECKING HISDAYTIME DIARY FOR NOVEMBER 30, 1958, WE FIND THE FOLLOWING ENTRY—“NOW I TRY TOFIND OUT MY CAREER—WHETHER AS A DOCTOR OR ANOTHER? IF AS A DOCTOR I MUST STUDYHARD”—IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THIS LETTER WAS PENNED DURING THIS PERIOD OF HISLIFE.2 [../Text/Part1.xhtml#a2]. LEE SHIU LOONG (OR LEE SHIU LUNG) LITERALLYTRANSLATES AS “LEE LITTLE DRAGON” (THE SURNAME ALWAYS COMES FIRST INCHINESE).THIS WAS THE “STAGE NAME” GIVEN TO BRUCE WHEN HE FIRST APPEARED IN HONGKONG FILMS. BRUCE’S BIRTH NAME WAS LEE JUN FAN, AND IN HIS EARLY SCHOOL YEARS HEWAS CALLED LEE YUEN KAM. AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY, BRUCE’S NICKNAME WAS SAI FON,LITERALLY “LITTLE PHOENIX.” THE ENGLISH NAME BRUCE WAS GIVEN TO HIM BY A NURSEWHEN HE WAS BORN, BUT HE DID NOT USE THIS NAME UNTIL AFTER THE AGE OF TWELVE,WHEN HE ATTENDED A SCHOOL WHERE ENGLISH WAS SPOKEN.3 [../Text/Part1.xhtml#a3]. BRUCE LEE ATTENDED SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER HIGH SCHOOLIN HONG KONG DURING 1958, ONE YEAR BEFORE HE SET OUT ON HIS RETURN TO AMERICA.4 [../Text/Part1.xhtml#a4]. BRUCE LEE BEGAN TO WRITE THIS LETTER TO A FRIEND INHONG KONG TO TELL HIM OF HIS EXPERIENCES ON THE BOAT THAT WAS TAKING HIM TOAMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE WAS BORN THERE ON NOVEMBER 27, 1940, SOMEEIGHTEEN YEARS EARLIER. THIS LETTER IS FASCINATING IN THAT IT SERVES AS A DIARYOF SORTS, WRITTEN ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS VOYAGE, WHEREIN HE RECORDS HISFEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES ON WHAT WOULD EVENTUALLY PROVE TO BE A HIGHLYSIGNIFICANT JOURNEY.5 [../Text/Part1.xhtml#a5]. CHOY LI FUT GUNG FU IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOSTPOPULAR GUNG FU SYSTEMS IN ASIA. IT IS PRACTICED BY APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OFTHE MARTIAL ARTISTS IN HONG KONG AND IS FAMOUS FOR COMBINING HARD AND SOFTTECHNIQUES, SPEED, BALANCE, POWER, AND EXTENSION. IN HER BOOK THE COMPLETE GUIDETO KUNG FU FIGHTING STYLES (BURBANK, CALIF: UNIQUE PUBLICATIONS, 1985),AUTHORITY JANE HALLANDER WRITES, “NOT ONLY DOES THE STYLE CONTAIN A VAST VARIETYOF HAND AND WEAPONS FORMS, BUT MANY OF THE TOP FULL-CONTACT TOURNAMENT FIGHTERSIN SOUTHEAST ASIA ARE CHOY-LI-FUT PRACTITIONERS, A FACT THAT SUPPORTS THE ART’SREPUTATION AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL KUNG FU STYLES IN EXISTENCE.”6 [../Text/Part1.xhtml#a6]. WING CHUN GUNG FU IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE.IT FOCUSES ON CENTERLINE ATTACKS, WASTING NO EFFORT AND USING BLOCKS TO REDIRECTTHE OPPONENT’S STRIKES, SO THAT THE WING CHUN PRACTITIONER CAN COUNTERATTACKWITH EITHER HIS BLOCKING HAND OR THE OTHER HAND IN A VERY CLOSE-IN POSITION.SINCE THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE, THERE ARE NO“CURVED” MOVEMENTS IN THE WING CHUN STYLE THAT WAS TAUGHT TO BRUCE LEE. SIXTYPERCENT OF ATTACKING TECHNIQUES ARE HAND TECHNIQUES AND THE OTHER FORTY PERCENTCONSISTS OF SHORT LOW KICKS, HAND AND FOOT TECHNIQUES BEING DELIVEREDSIMULTANEOUSLY.

IN A WEEK OR SO I’LL HAVE TO FLY TO NEW YORK.HOWEVER, I’LL TRY TO FIND TIME IN BETWEEN TO FINISH THE ARTICLES.

INSTEAD OF[BEING] MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, THEY ARE MUTUALLY DEPENDENT AND ARE A FUNCTION EACHOF THE OTHER.WHEN I SAY “THE HEAT MAKES ME PERSPIRE,” THE HEAT AND PERSPIRING ARE JUST “ONE”PROCESS AS THEY ARE CO-EXISTENT AND ONE COULD NOT EXIST BUT FOR THE OTHER. JUSTAS AN OBJECT NEEDS A SUBJECT, THE PERSON IN ATTACK IS NOT TAKING AN INDEPENDENTPOSITION BUT IS ACTING AS AN ASSISTANT. AFTER ALL, YOU NEED YOUR OPPONENT TOCOMPLETE THE OTHER HALF OF A WHOLE.THUS GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS IS ONE INSEPARABLE FORCE OF ONE UNCEASING INTERPLAY OFMOVEMENT. IF A PERSON RIDING A BICYCLE WISHES TO GO SOMEWHERE, HE CANNOT PUMP ONBOTH THE PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME OR NOT PUMP ON THEM AT ALL. IN ORDER TO MOVEFORWARD HE HAS TO PUMP ON ONE PEDAL AND RELEASE THE OTHER. SO THE MOVEMENT OFGOING FORWARD REQUIRES THIS “ONENESS” OF PUMPING AND RELEASING, AND VICE VERSA,EACH BEING THE CAUSE OF THE OTHER.THIS “ONENESS” IS JUST A BASIC IDEA IN THE SYMBOL. THEN THERE IS MODERATIONWITHOUT GOING TO EITHER EXTREME, THE WONDER OF THE ORDINARY....IN GENERAL,HOWEVER, THE IDEA IS THAT—IF GUNG FU IS EXTRAORDINARY, IT IS BECAUSE OF THE FACTTHAT IT IS NOTHING AT ALL SPECIAL—IT IS SIMPLY THE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF ONE’SFEELING WITH THE MINIMUM OF LINES AND ENERGY.

OF COURSE YOU HELPED MEWHILE WE WERE IN HONG KONG AND I’M GRATEFUL, BUT PLEASE WRITE TO ME AS A FRIEND,NOT AS ONE WHO HAS ALL THE ANSWERS, WHICH I’M SURE NO ONE HAS. THESE ARE FACTSI’M PUTTING DOWN AND AM NOT TRYING TO BE DISAGREEABLE.THINGS ARE GETTING PRETTY GOOD HERE IN CALIF. AND IF I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU THATI’M MARRIED, WELL, I AM—SHE IS A REAL NICE GIRL AND IS A STRAIGHT ‘A’. STUDENT.WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR A YEAR SOMETHING NOW. IN FACT, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ABABY SOON.JUST AS AN OBJECT NEEDS A SUBJECT, THE PERSON IN ATTACK IS NOT TAKING ANINDEPENDENT POSITION BUT IS ACTING AS AN ASSISTANT. ... YOU NEED YOUR OPPONENTTO COMPLETE THE OTHER HALF OF A WHOLE. . . . THUS GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS IS ONEINSEPARABLE FORCE OF ONE UNCEASING INTERPLAY OF MOVEMENT.THE BOOK YOU READ IS A BASIC BOOK I’VE WRITTEN SOMEWHERE IN 19636[../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb6] AND I’M IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING A MUCH [MORE]THOROUGH BOOK ON THE TAO OF GUNG FU.7 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb7] IT WILL BE THESIZE OF NISHIYAMA’S BOOK [KARATE: THE ART OF EMPTY HAND] IF YOU’VE SEEN IT.

YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE A CHINAMAN I WOULD THINK YOU ARETRYING TO BE FUNNY BY ENDING THE LETTER, “YOUR SEE HING” [YOUR SENIOR], TAKY. .. .8 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb8]WELL, I GUESS I WOULDN’T BE IN LIFE MAGAZINE YET BECAUSE THEY WANT TOCONCENTRATE FIRST ON “BATMAN.” YOU BETTER TAKE DAMN GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF ANDDON’T MOVE TOO MUCH YET, AND LET CHRIS TAKE CARE OF THE CLASS. YOU HAVE TOPUSH... TO HELP PUSH GUNG FU IN SEATTLE.[THE MARTIAL ARTIST YOU MENTIONED] IS NO SWEAT AS HE DOESN’T EVEN UNDERSTANDWHAT IS RHYTHM (TIMING) & DISTANCE, WHICH IS THE CORE OF ALL MARTIAL ART. OFCOURSE SIMPLICITY IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT, TOO. WHEN HE DOES OPEN THE CLASS, IDO NOT THINK HE WILL BE A THREAT AS I KNOW YOU HAVE BETTER BASIC REQUIREMENTS,THOUGH HE IS “BLOWN UP” WITH SO-CALLED MUSCLES, [THEY ARE] NOT EFFICIENT ONES,UNFORTUNATELY.I’LL SEE TO IT THAT THE DUMMY WILL BE ON THE WAY, EVEN IF I HAVE TO SEND ITMYSELF. I DIDN’T GIVE THAT DEMONSTRATION ON THE 20TH OF THIS MONTH BECAUSE I AMNOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT—I MIGHT HELP RALPH CASTRO ON HIS WORLD TOURNAMENT THISCOMING 6TH OF MARCH.I HAVE STOPPED TRAINING FOR TWO WEEKS NOW AND WILL RESUME AGAIN WHEN I’M BACK INHONG KONG.

IT WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE ROOT OFTHINGS10 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb10]—RHYTHM, TIMING, DISTANCE—AND EMBRACE THEFIVE WAYS OF ATTACK.11 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb11] THIS IS BY FAR THE MOSTEFFECTIVE METHOD I’VE EVER ENCOUNTERED OR WILL ENCOUNTER. ANYTHING BEYOND THISHAS TO BE SUPER-FANTASTIC. WING CHUN IS THE STARTING POINT, CHI SAO IS THENUCLEUS, AND [THEY ARE] SUPPLEMENTED BY THE FIVE WAYS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM WILLCONCENTRATE ON IRREGULAR RHYTHM AND HOW TO DISTURB AND INTERCEPT THE OPPONENT’SRHYTHM THE FASTEST AND MOST EFFICIENT WAY. ABOVE ALL, THIS SYSTEM IS NOTCONFINED TO STRAIGHT LINE OR CURVED LINE, BUT IS CONTENT TO STAND IN THE MIDDLEOF THE CIRCLE WITHOUT ATTACHMENT. THIS WAY ONE CAN MEET ANY LINES WITHOUT BEINGFAMILIAR WITH THEM.

ALTHOUGH A CONTRACT HASBEEN PROPOSED, THE WHOLE DEAL IS NOT 100%, HOWEVER, IT IS 70% THAT IT WILLSUCCEED. AT LEAST THAT’S WHAT MY AGENT TOLD ME.IN THE MEANTIME I’VE BEEN TEACHING MY BROTHERS AND SOME FRIENDS GUNG FU AT MYHOUSE. THEY ARE VERY ENTHUSED OVER THE WHOLE DEAL. I, TOO, AM WORKING ON MYTRANSFORMATION OF SIMPLICITY TO YET ANOTHER MORE FREE-FLOWING MOVEMENTS OF NOLIMIT LIMITATION.OYAMA’S BOOK THIS IS KARATE IS OUT AND IT IS QUITE INTERESTING AS IT CONTAINSQUITE A FEW OF [THE] ANCIENT GUNG FU METHODS.17 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb17] ASFOR ACTUAL APPLICATION OF TECHNIQUES, IT IS STILL TOO FAR BEHIND. HE ADMITS THATGUNG FU’S THEORY IS MORE SOUND AND PRACTICAL.SHOCKED TO HEAR OF THE 2ND CLAY-LISTON FIGHT. IF IT WASN’T A FIX, LISTON MUSTHAVE TIMED IN ON THE ON-COMING FORCE OF CLAY’S PUNCH.BY THE WAY, IF THERE IS ANY DUES I’LL APPRECIATE IT IF YOU CAN SEND THEM TO ME.ALSO, DO REPORT ON THE CLASS[’S] PROGRESS AS WELL AS YOURS AND CHARLES[’S].BRUCETO TAKY KIMURAPOSTED FROM KOWLOON, HONG KONG, ON JUNE 8, 1965, AT 6:00 PMJUNE 7, 1965TAKY,THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER PLUS MONEY ORDER. I, TOO, WAS SURPRISED AT THE OUTCOMEOF THE CLAY/LISTON FIGHT; I CAN ONLY SAY THIS, LISTON MUST HAVE TIMED HISRUSHING IN WITH THE RIGHT HAND PUNCH OF CLAY SO WELL THAT EVEN HE (LISTON) WASKNOCKED OUT COLD—THAT IS IF NOTHING ELSE WAS INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT.YOU ARE RIGHT THAT LISTON IS SLOW WHEN HE COMES TO CHASE A FIGHTER, BUT CLAY ISYET TO BE PROVED AGAINST OTHER FAST MOVING FIGHTERS. YOU KNOW, IT IS THE STYLEOF CLAY THAT SCREWED UP LISTON THE MOST.SO MR. “I DON’T THINK SO” MET THE SAME FATE AS MASAFUSA AND GOT HIMSELFDEPORTED. TOO DAMN BAD FOR HIM, ASIDE FROM ALL OBNOXIOUS MANNERS, HE IS QUITE ALIKEABLE FELLOW—SOMETIMES.[THE FELLOW YOU MENTIONED] IS AN EXTREMELY LAZY FELLOW BUT HE DOES LIKE TO SHOWOFF A LITTLE BIT, SO I AM KIND OF AMAZED THAT HE WILL FIND TIME (FROM NOTSLEEPING OR GAMBLING) TO B.S. THE CHINESE BUNCH IN CHINATOWN. AS FAR AS SKILL ORBASIC REQUIREMENTS [ARE] CONCERNED, YOU [HAVE BEEN] AHEAD OF HIM FOR QUITE SOMETIME. IN FACT, KNOWING HIM, [ALTHOUGH] HE MIGHT BE TALKING THIS OR THAT, HE ISSCARED OF YOU INSIDE. THIS IS NO KIDDING. SHOW HIM A LITTLE RESPECT AND THISSUCKER IS DYING TO SHOW YOU ALL HIS FANCY MOVEMENTS. IF YOU HAVE TIME, YOU MIGHTLEARN A FEW FORMS (SET UP BY HIM FROM BOOKS PROBABLY) FROM HIM. IT IS USELESSFOR ME TO TELL YOU THE TECHNIQUES AREN’T WORTH A DAMN, BUT YOU WILL FIND OUT.SINCE WE MET, HIS STYLE HAS CHANGED.CHARLES BOUGHT A HOUSE! WHAT THE HELL [DOES] HE WANT WITH IT? [MAYBE HE’LL] GETMARRIED OR SOMETHING.I’LL FIND OUT ABOUT THE WOODEN DUMMY THE FIRST CHANCE I GET; I THINK THE DUMMYWILL HELP YOU IN SHARPENING YOUR SKILL.TALKING ABOUT METHOD, MY STYLE HAS [NOW BEEN] FORMED, BUT [I’LL] HAVE TO SEE YOUPERSONALLY TO EXPLAIN [IT].18 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb18] THE IDEA CAN BE SUMMEDUP AS THIS—JUST AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO COME IN ON AN OPPONENT WITH NO BAI-JONG(THUS, NO GUIDED LINES OR BOUNDARY) IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO [FIND A SOLUTIONFOR] A METHOD WITH NO EXACT STYLE OR METHOD (YET GOVERNED BY AN IMMOVABLE FIRSTPRINCIPLE).19 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb19] TIMING AND DISTANCE ARE THE BASICSTUFFS, BUT WING CHUN PRINCIPLE IS THE NUCLEUS (THE MOST IMPORTANT FOUNDATION).BY THE WAY, ROBERT WISE WILL CONTACT ME REGARDING A PART IN THE MOVIE “SANDPEBBLES.”20 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb20]B.TO JAMES YIMM LEE21 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb21]POSTED FROM KOWLOON, HONG KONG, ON JULY 30, 1965, AT 8:00 AMJULY 29, 1965JAMES,YOUR LETTER ARRIVED ONE HOUR AGO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR IDEAS ON [THE WOODEN] DUMMYAND THE ORDERING OF THOSE BOOKS.Image [../Images/57a.jpg]JAMES YIMM LEE (LEFT) AND BRUCE LEE, CO. 1969BEFORE I GO ON TO SHOW YOU THE COUNTER OFFENSIVE OF THE TECHNIQUES YOU ASK, I’LLGO ON WITH THIS LETTER FIRST. I’M GOING TO USE ANOTHER AIR LETTER FOR THEILLUSTRATION OF SIL LUM TAO.BY THE WAY, WE’VE FINISHED THE SHOOTING OF THE WHOLE SET OF SIL LUM TAO AND MANYOTHER [TECHNIQUES], DEMONSTRATED BY MY SIFU YIP MAN. OVER 130 PHOTOS HAVE BEENTAKEN AND WHEN WE’RE THROUGH THERE WILL BE WAY OVER 200. THESE PICTURES WILLPROVE TO BE VALUABLE WHEN MY BOOK COMES OUT AS NEVER BEFORE [HAS] THE WING CHUNMASTER, SIFU YIP MAN EVER BEEN ON PHOTOGRAPH. HE IS 66 NOW, I THINK, AND YEARSAFTER THAT THESE PHOTOS WILL BE THE ONLY SET.NICE TO HEAR JOHNNY CHOY IS COMING—TOO DAMN BAD YOU CAN’T MAKE IT.THE BAI-JONG MAKES SENSE BUT OTHER THAN THAT ALL TECHNIQUES ARE NOT SO COOL.THIS OLD MAN LEUNG HAS ASTHMA AND IS PRETTY SICK LATELY AND THAT’S WHY HE CAN’TCONTINUE TO SHOW ME OTHER STYLES. IF TIME PERMITS I HOPE TO GET AS MANY OTHERCHOP SUEYS AS POSSIBLE TO FORMULATE MY STYLE, WHICH I’VE BEEN WORKING ON NEARLYEVERY DAY AS I’VE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.22 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb22] YOU KNOW HOW“MASTER LEE” IS LIVING NOW!GOOD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR NOT [THE] SELLING TEAK WOOD [FURNITURE] TO BOB. I PLANTO BUY THEM BACK ON MY RETURN. BUDDY, FORGET ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL $200. YOUDON’T HAVE TO PAY ME.HERE ARE SOME COUNTERS FOR THAT TECHNIQUE THAT GOT YOU PERPLEXED.

FROM NOW ON) IS BASED ON FEINTING, ANDFEINTING IS TO DRAW THE OPPONENT TO THE EXECUTION OF A PARRY OR BLOCK. REMEMBERTHAT ALTHOUGH FEINTING CONSISTS MAINLY OF 2 MOVEMENTS (SOMETIMES THREE, BUT NOMORE THAN THAT!) THEY MUST BE ONE SMOOTH FLOWING ACTION. THE FOLLOWING NOTESWILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE EXECUTION OF FEINTING, WHICH WILL MAKE YOUADVANCE INTO YOUR OPPONENT’S DEFENSE FASTER AND SAFER.A) THE FIRST MOVEMENT (FEINT) MUST BE LONG AND DEEP (BY THAT I MEAN PENETRATING)TO DRAW THE PARRY. THE SECOND REAL MOVEMENT (ATTACK) MUST BE FAST & DECISIVEALLOWING THE DEFENDER NO POSSIBILITY OF RECOVERY—LONG-SHORT—EVEN IN THE DELIVERYOF ATTACK WITH TWO FEINTS, THE DEPTH OF THE FIRST FEINT MUST FORCE THE OPPONENTTO MOVE TO THE DEFENSE—LONG-SHORT-SHORT.B) GAIN DISTANCE—TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE THE HAND HAD TO TRAVEL BY A GOOD HALFWITH YOUR FEINT, AND LEAVE TO YOUR SECOND MOVEMENT ONLY THE SECOND HALF OF THEDISTANCE—KNOWN AS PROGRESSIVE ATTACK.C) GAIN TIME—(BY DECEIVING THE PARRY SO THAT EVEN [THOUGH] YOU ARE SLOWER, YOUCAN STILL STRIKE HIM). TO TIME THIS MOVEMENT OF ARM CROSSING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT(RIGHT TO LEFT, UP TO DOWN, DOWN TO UP), FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE DIRECTION TOTHAT OF THE ATTACK [I.E., TO MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE FORCE OF YOUROPPONENT’S ATTACK]—IT IS WHILE THE OPPONENT’S ARM IS TRAVELING ACROSS THAT HEMUST START HIS OFFENSIVE ACTION—THUS THE SECOND MOVEMENT (IN OTHER WORDS, THEATTACK AFTER THE FIRST MOVEMENT WHICH IS THE FEINT) SHOULD MOVE AHEAD OF THEOPPONENT’S PARRY, THAT IS BEING DECEIVED BY YOUR FIRST MOVEMENT, THE FEINT.I HOPE AFTER MUCH THINKING ON THE ABOVE NOTE YOU WILL BEGIN TO FEEL THISINDIRECT PROGRESSIVE ATTACK. REMEMBER THAT SPEED MUST BE REGULATED TO COINCIDEWITH THE OPPONENT’S MOVEMENT.Image [../Images/60a.jpg]NOTE: CHINESE CHARACTERS ACCOMPANYING BRUCE’S SKETCHES: (NO. 1B—“HORSE STANCE”),(NO.2—“MOVE YOUR BODY BY SIDE-STEPPING TO THE RIGHT, WHILE PERFORMING A LOWBLOCK AND THEN GO IMMEDIATELY TO A STRAIGHT PUNCH”)I’M HAVING A GUNG FU SYSTEM DRAWN UP—THIS SYSTEM IS A COMBINATION OF CHIEFLYWING CHUN, FENCING AND BOXING.

LIMBERING EXERCISES—A “MUST” IN THE GENERAL PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN AND TOLIMBER (FLEXIBILITY) MAIN PARTS OF THE BODY ARE:1. WAIST—TWISTING, BENDING (FRONT, BACK, LEFT & RIGHT), AND ROTATING.2. LEG—MAINLY STRETCHING OR KICKING (FRONT KICK & SIDE KICK).3. SHOULDER—ROTATION & PULLING BACK STRETCH.4. ARM—MAINLY PUSH-UP OR ANY BASIC WEIGHT TRAINING YOU THINK BENEFICIAL.5. WRIST—ROTATING, FLEXING, OR WITH WEIGHT.USE YOUR OWN IDEAS BASED ON CREATING NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF THEBODY IN GUNG FU—THE HELL WITH CONVENTIONAL METHODS AND OPINIONS.II. PUNCHING—PAPER, PARTNER FACING, SANDBAG, ETC.III. KICKING—PARTNER FACING.IV. TECHNIQUES—AS USED BEFORE OR ANY SENSIBLE MOVE YOU CAN CHOOSE.MAKE USE OF THE WOODEN DUMMY AND EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE AT OUR “SHAOLIN TEMPLE”GYM.

I MEAN DOESHE GO AROUND CLOSING UP GUNG FU SCHOOLS? IF HE DOES AND IF HE IS REALLY, REALLYGOOD AT HIS AGE, THEN THE B.S. ARTISTS WILL BE THE FIRST VICTIMS. THERE IS ASAYING, “LIVE AND LET LIVE,” SO THE “RUNNER’S” NOT OPENING A GUNG FU SCHOOL HASNOTHING TO DO WITH THIS OLD MAN. AFTER ALL, A MAN AT 73 CAN’T AFFORD TO GOAROUND USING PHYSICAL VIOLENCE, MAYBE VERBAL VIOLENCE.AS FOR THE “RUNNER’S” GUNG FU SCHOOL, IT’S JUST ANOTHER WASTE OF TIME WITH ALITTLE BIT MORE TO OFFER—CALISTHENICS!

I’VE SHOWNTHE IRON RINGS METHOD (I’VE MADE 8, 3 POUNDS EACH) TO MY INSTRUCTOR AND HE ISCONVINCED WHEN I DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT IN SIL LUM TAO WHEN THE “OPEN HAND” ISCOMING OUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING INTO A “CLOSE HAND” AND WHEN A “CLOSEHAND” IS COMING OUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO STOP THE ONCOMING “OPEN HAND.” THUS, THEIRON RINGS WILL GIVE THE NECESSARY RESISTANCE WHEN THE PRACTITIONER DIRECTS HISENERGY OUTWARD WITHOUT TENSING HIS FINGERS AND WRIST. MORE RESISTANCE CAN BEPROVIDED BY WEARING MORE IRON RINGS. THIS IS AN ALIVE WAY OF BUILDING “LONGBRIDGE FORCE” WITHOUT GETTING THE HANDS RIGID. THIS IS A KIND OF MODERNIZEDPROGRESSIVE WEIGHT TRAINING METHOD THAT IS EFFECTIVE. ANYTHING FOR THEBETTERMENT OF WING CHUN.NO, I DO NOT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BUMPING INTO [THE RUNNER] OR [THE OTHER MANYOU MENTIONED]. AREN’T THEY SUPPOSED TO HAVE RETURNED ALREADY?

MORE WEIGHTSHOULD BE BACK TO THE REAR.

IN OTHERWORDS, THE SERIES WILL DEFINITELY BE OUT THIS COMING SEASON, WHICH IS THISCOMING SEPTEMBER.AT PRESENT 20TH CENTURY FOX IS SENDING ME TO DRAMA SCHOOL—THE DRAMA COACH ISJEFF COREY, THE BEST HERE IN HOLLYWOOD—AT $70 AN HOUR (IF I WERE TO PAY, I’LLTELL THEM I’VE GOT IT!* [../Text/Part2.xhtml#p2s2]). THE LESSONS (THREE TIMES AWEEK) [ARE] DOING ME A LOT OF GOOD AND [ARE MAKING ME] MORE FLUID WITHNOT-ACTING ACTING—A MOST DIFFICULT WAY TO ACHIEVE UNNATURAL NATURALNESS.

IF I DIDN’T TELL YOU, THE DATE HAS [BEEN] SET FOR THE SHOOTING (THOUGH ASOF NOW THERE ISN’T A GREEN HORNET);27 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb27] IT WILL BE ONTHE 23RD OF NEXT MONTH.BY THE WAY, I’LL BE MOVING TO ANOTHER REALLY “COOL” APARTMENT, THE BARRINGTONPLAZA—A 27 STORIES HIGH LUXURY TOWER WITH DOORMEN AND ATTENDANT PARKING, LAUNDRY& DRY CLEANING VALET SERVICE, OLYMPIC-SIZE POOL, ALL-WOOL CARPETING, ALLELECTRIC KITCHEN (DISHWASHER, BUILT-IN RANGE AND OVEN, ETC.), ELECTRONIC HUGEELEVATORS—I’LL BE LIVING ON THE 23RD STOREY (THE HIGHER, THE MORE EXPENSIVE) ANDI’M TELLING YOU IT’S SOMETHING ELSE.HOWEVER, DO NOT THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT I’LL PAY $300 A MONTH FOR THIS APARTMENT(THAT’S HOW MUCH IT ACTUALLY COSTS); YOU SEE THE HALF OWNER OF THE APARTMENTWISHES TO TAKE GUNG FU FROM ME AND SO I GOT A DAMN GOOD DEAL ON IT. THE PRESENTAPARTMENT I’M LIVING IN COSTS $120 (L.A.’S APARTMENTS COST MORE—ESPECIALLY INTHE WESTERN PART) AND GET A LOAD OF THIS—FOR THOSE FANCY DEAL (OH, THERE IS ABEAUTIFUL BREAKFAST BAR, TOO) THIS APARTMENT THAT I’M MOVING IN NOW COSTS ME$140 A MONTH! ALL THE SERVICES I MENTIONED—LIKE DOORMEN, ATTENDANT PARKING,SECURITY GUARDS, HOUSE SERVICES—ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE DEAL.BY THE WAY, BATMAN AND ROBIN ALSO LIVE THERE.28 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb28] SOFOR TWO HOURS [OF] PRIVATE LESSON FOR THE OWNER, I ONLY PAY FOR HALF THE RENT.THIS BARRINGTON PLAZA IS A FAMOUS SPOT HERE AND YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO APPRECIATEIT—LIKE A PARK INSIDE WITH TWO GIGANTIC 27 STOREY TOWER BUILDINGS SURROUNDINGIT, WITH ALL KINDS OF STORES AND WHAT NOT ON THE BOTTOM LEVEL. THEY CLAIM YOUCAN LIVE A YEAR INSIDE THE PLACE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO OUT AND BUY ANYTHING!SO MUCH FOR THAT. I’M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE BOYS ARE LOYAL TO THE SCHOOL. ITHINK CHRIS SHOULD BE PROMOTED TO 3RD. HIS LOYALTY CERTAINLY DEMANDS ATTENTION,BUT HIS LAZINESS AND [LACK OF] DRIVE IS SOMETHING ELSE—WELL, I’LL LEAVE THISMATTER IN YOUR HANDS AND YOU WILL HAVE TO JUDGE AND SEE WHAT FITS. YOU ARE THEHEAD INSTRUCTOR IN CHARGE AND YOU WILL DECIDE ON HIM—ON THE REST OF THE BOYS, INFACT. YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GIVE OUT RANK, YOU KNOW. BY THE WAY, YOU ARE THEONLY ONE THAT CAN DO SO. SO LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR DECISION IS AND IF THERE ISANY MEMBERSHIP CARD THAT NEEDS TO BE STAMPED BY MY SEAL JUST TELL THE STUDENT TOSEND THEM TO YOU AND YOU MAIL THEM TO ME.LET ME TELL YOU AN INCIDENT THAT IS A WARNING TO US ALL. THE JAPAN AMERICASOCIETY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS PRESENTING A DEMONSTRATION OF“THE DEFENSIVEARTS—AIKIDO, JUDO, KENDO, AND KARATE.” H.N. WAS HEADING THE DEMONSTRATION AND IAND THE EX-PUBLISHER OF BLACK BELT, ED JUNG WAS THERE. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT!THE H.N. OF FOUR YEARS AGO (IN WASHINGTON) HAS SLIPPED AND WHAT [THERE] IS NOWIS AN OLD MAN—LIKE HE COULDN’T EVEN SNAP DECENTLY, NOR CAN HE SHOW HISTECHNIQUES SMARTLY—NOT EVEN IN A CLASSICAL MANNER. IT WAS A QUICK CHANGE FROMTHE LAST TIME I SAW HIM. AT LEAST AT THAT TIME HE COULD CLASSICALLY DEMONSTRATEHIS TECHNIQUES WITH PRECISION AND SNAP—SO THAT GOES TO PROVE THE OLD CHINESESAYING “SONG (SINGING) NEVER LEAVE THE MOUTH, FIST NEVER LEAVE THE HAND.” DO WEHAVE TO WORK, WORK, WORK—THE AIKIDO IS SOMETHING ELSE! COMPLETELY OUT OFREALITY. THERE MIGHT BE A STRONG AIKIDO MAN, BUT HIS POWER IS EVIDENCED ONLYWHEN HE PRACTICES AMONG HIS FELLOW PARTNERS WHO WILL DANCE WITH HIM AND FOOLAROUND WITH HIS FLOW OF KI.29 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb29]TAKY, YOU HAVE SOMETHING OVER [THAT OTHER MARTIAL ARTIST YOU MENTIONED]—THAT ISNOT BEING CLASSICALLY INCLINED AND THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF EXPLOSIVELYAND ECONOMICALLY. THE MORE I OBSERVE THE PREVALENT KARATE MEN HERE [IN THEWEST], THE MORE I’M AMAZED AT THE PUBLIC THAT IGNORANTLY EATS UP SUCH [AN]IMPRACTICAL MESS [WITHOUT] AT LEAST ANALYZING KARATE WITH THEIR [OWN] MORE ALIVE[AND] CERTAINLY MORE PRACTICAL SPORT [OF] BOXING! IF YOU WANT TO EXCEL IN GUNGFU, YOU HAVE TO THROW AWAY ALL CLASSICAL JUNK AND FACE COMBAT IN ITS SUCHNESS,WHICH IS SIMPLE AND DIRECT. FORMS AND CLASSICAL TECHNIQUES THAT [THE MARTIALARTIST YOU MENTIONED] TEACHES ARE “ORGANIZED DESPAIR” THAT SERVE ONLY TO DISTORTAND CRAMP HIS STUDENTS AND DISTRACT THEM FROM THE ACTUAL REALITY OF COMBAT. SUCHMEANS OF PRACTICE (A FORM OF PARALYSIS) SOLIDIFY AND CONDITION WHAT WAS ONCEFREE AND FLUID. THROW AWAY MYSTICISM AND B.S., IT IS REALLY NOTHING BUT A BLINDDEVOTION TO THE SYSTEMATIC USELESSNESS OF PRACTICING ROUTINES AND STUNTS THATLEAD TO NOWHERE.EVEN A MAN THAT MOVES CLASSICALLY FAST AND SNAPPY IS REALLY NOT TOO MUCH TO BEPRAISED—YOU SEE HE IS TRYING TO SET A RHYTHM, NOT TO ADJUST [TO] BROKEN RHYTHM,WHICH IS THE THING THAT WILL HAPPEN IN ACTUAL COMBAT. THEN YOU HAVE TO TAKEREACTIONAL SPEED, ETC., ETC., INTO CONSIDERATION. MOST OF THE SELF-DEFENSESYSTEMS ARE “DEAD” BECAUSE THE CLASSICAL TECHNIQUES ARE FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO“ARREST” AND “FIX” THE EVER-CHANGING MOVEMENT IN COMBAT AND TO DISSECT ANDANALYZE THEM LIKE A CORPSE. WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO IT, REAL COMBAT IS NOT FIXEDAND IS DEFINITELY VERY MUCH “ALIVE.”I’VE BEEN BUSY LIKE HELL WITH ACTING LESSONS AND GUNG FU LESSONS (THE SAME STUFFI TEACH IN THE GROUP CLASS—NOTHING SPECTACULAR) AND TONIGHT I’M INVITED TOATTEND AN ACADEMY AWARD DINNER PARTY IN HOLLYWOOD. NICK ADAMS (A BLACK BELT,SUPPOSEDLY), SAL MINEO, ETC., WILL BE THERE.IF YOU WANT TO EXCEL IN GUNG FU, YOU HAVE TO THROW AWAY ALL CLASSICAL JUNK ANDFACE COMBAT IN ITS SUCHNESS, WHICH IS SIMPLE AND DIRECT.I’LL SHOOT THE TECHNIQUES AND WHAT NOT AS SOON AS I CAN FIND TIME. I MIGHT FLYTO VEGAS THIS WEEK TO MEET SINATRA—NOTHING DEFINITE YET.GOOD LUCK ON THE JAPANESE GIRLS’ CLASS. USE CREATIVENESS IN THE GIRLS’ CLASS ANDTHINK IN TERMS OF THEIR LIKES, WITHOUT MESSING UP THE CENTRAL THEME. I’LL MAILSELLING POINTERS WHEN I FIND THE TIME.TAKE CARE MY DEAR FRIEND,BRUCETO FRED SATOMAY 4, 1966DEAR FRED,THANK YOU FOR YOUR LAST LETTER THAT REACHED ME AT MY PRESENT ADDRESS WHICH YOUWILL FIND ON THE TOP OF THE ENVELOPE. I’VE MOVED TO THIS NEW APARTMENT THE 20THOF LAST MONTH.SO YOU ARE TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON—HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? DO YOUHAVE TO CRAM IN A LOT OF ‘THROWS’ IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME?BY THE WAY, WHAT DOES THIS MR. LEE CAMERON WANT? I HAVEN’T RECEIVED A LETTERFROM HIM YET. I’M KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHAT HE WANTS, DO YOU KNOW? TAKY DIDN’TGET IN TOUCH WITH ME EITHER.THE SHOW IS RE-SCHEDULED TO BE SHOT ON THE 1ST OF JUNE, AND THE FIRST PREMIERSHOW IS ON THE 9TH OF SEPTEMBER. RIGHT NOW I’M BUSY LIKE HECK FOR INTERVIEWS ANDPUBLICITY PICTURES, ETC., ETC. I MIGHT BE FLYING IN TO NEW YORK FOR A PRESSINTERVIEW IN A WEEK OR TWO. MOVIE SCREEN MAGAZINE WILL COME TO OUR APARTMENT ANDDO A STORY ON [US] THIS FRIDAY.IT IS MOST INTERESTING TO WORK ON THE COORDINATION OF ARM AND BODY FOR THAT WILLMAKE A JUDOKA ABLE TO EXERT TWICE (PERHAPS TRIPLE) HIS POWER AND A GUNG FU MANTO STRIKE HIS BODYWEIGHT. USING ARM FORCE ALONE IS INDEED CHARACTERISTIC OF THEUNTRAINED PERSON (IN FACT, A LOT OF INSTRUCTORS ARE PRACTITIONERS OF THIS) ANDSINCE STRIKING IS MAINLY USED IN GUNG FU, I’LL DISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP OF ARMPOWER AND BODY POWER (WAIST OR HIP MOVEMENT) IN A PUNCH. I’M SURE THAT THEREWILL BE A SIMILAR BASIC SOURCE AS IN THROWING.IT WILL FACILITATE THE ANALYSIS OF PUTTING IN THE WAIST WITH THE ARM BY DIVIDINGTHE HUMAN BODY INTO TWO HALVES WITH AN IMAGINARY CENTER LINE AS IN FIG. 1[../Text/Part2.xhtml#f1].Image [../Images/74a.jpg]Image [../Images/74b.jpg]FIG. 2 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#f2] SHOWS A PERSON RELEASING HIS RIGHT SIDE ANDPROPELLING HIS BODYWEIGHT (AS IN AN ORDINARY RIGHT HAND PUNCH) BY BRACINGHIMSELF ON HIS LEFT FOOT THAT ACTS AS THE HINGE AROUND WHICH HIS RIGHT SIDEBODYWEIGHT AND POWER ROTATES. THE HIP AND SHOULDER ARE DRIVEN FIRST TO THEIMAGINARY CENTER LINE THEN THE ARM COMES INTO PLAY ‘EXPLOSIVELY.’ THE WHOLE IDEAIS TO TRANSFER THE WEIGHT TO THE OPPONENT’S TARGET AREA BEFORE THE WEIGHTTRANSFERS TO THE LEFT LEG. THAT IS ALSO WHY IN STEPPING IN TO STRIKE, THELEADING FOOT SHOULD NOT LAND FIRST, OR THE BODYWEIGHT WILL REST UPON THE FLOORINSTEAD OF BEING BEHIND THE STRIKING HAND. OF COURSE, ALL THESE ARE COORDINATEDVERY, VERY FAST; BUT THE WAIST REVERSE DOES COME A SPLIT SECOND FASTER.IF YOU MANIPULATE THIS IMAGINARY CENTER LINE IT MIGHT EVOLVE SOME NEW ANGLE FORYOUR JUDO ANALYSIS. FROM THIS CENTER LINE I WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A NUCLEUS ANDLATER ON ABLE TO JUMP AWAY FROM THE NUCLEUS AND ESTABLISH OUT OF LINE AND BROKENRHYTHM COUNTER ATTACK. THUS MY THEORY THAT STATES—1) LEARN THE CENTER, 2) KEEPTHE CENTER, AND 3) DISSOLVE THE CENTER. OR IT CAN BE STATED MORE GENERALLY—1)LEARN THE RULES, 2) KEEP TO THE RULES, AND 3) DISSOLVE THE RULES.MY THEORY THAT STATES— 1) LEARN THE CENTER; 2) KEEP THE CENTER; AND 3) DISSOLVETHE CENTER... CAN BE STATED MORE GENERALLY—1) LEARN THE RULES, 2) KEEP TO THERULES, AND 3) DISSOLVE THE RULES.BY THE WAY, EMPHASIS MUST BE MADE TO THE STUDENTS TO THROW WITH THEIR BODYBECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IN TERMS OF FORCE AND POWER, THE ARMS HAVE BUT ONEQUARTER OF THE FORCE OF THE BODY WHEN SET IN MOTION. SECONDLY, THE MOVEMENTS OFTHE WAIST ARE LONG AND FREE WHILE THOSE OF THE ARMS ARE SHORT. YOU CAN SAY THATONE TURNING OF A LARGE AXIS IS EQUIVALENT TO MANY TURNINGS OF A SMALL AXIS.I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE ARMS DO EXERT MAXIMUM STRENGTH TOWARD THEEND OF THE MOVEMENT—THEREFORE, THE ARMS ARE THE VEHICLE OF FORCE THAT ISRELEASED BY THE BODY THROUGH THIS CENTER LINE IDEA. BOXING ALSO MAKES USE OFTHIS CENTER LINE BUSINESS BUT EXPRESSES IT IN TOO BIG A MOTION. IT IS ALL RIGHTAT FIRST BUT LATER ON IT SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY—TOEXPRESS THE UTMOST IN THE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTS AND ENERGY. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OFJUDO, THE MOVEMENTS CAN BE A LITTLE MORE THAN GUNG FU BECAUSE IT DOESN’T INVOLVESTRIKING AND COUNTER-STRIKING.IF I WERE TO WORK ON JUDO I’D MAKE USE OF THIS CENTERLINE (I HAVEN’T REALLYWORKED ON IT—ON TOP OF THAT I HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT) ANDCLASSIFY THE ATTACKS IN JUDO SOMETHING LIKE:1. DIRECT ATTACK—QUICK AND POWERFUL ONE ACTION DRIVE IN TO THROW OPPONENT.2. COMBINATION ATTACK—TO COMBINE TWO OR THREE THROWS IN A ROW TO DISTURB THEOPPONENT’S RHYTHM.3. INDIRECT ATTACK—TO USE FALSE ATTACK TO DRAW A REACTION FROM THE OPPONENT ANDMAKE USE OF THIS REACTION FOR YOUR THROW— SEEMS LIKE THIS FIELD IS RARELY USEDIN ORIENTAL SYSTEMS. EVERYTHING STARTS FROM IMMOBILE TO MOBILE. FEINTS AND WHATNOT, IF DONE IN A THREATENING MANNER, CAN DISTURB EVEN A CALM AND COOL OPERATOR.4. ATTACK BY DRAWING—APPARENT OPENING TO OPPONENT AND COUNTER HIS ATTACK TO IT.THERE ARE MORE THAN THAT I’M SURE, BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD ON IT, ONE HAS TO JUMPOUT FROM THE CLASSICAL RIGIDITY AND SEE THE FIELD IN A MORE PRACTICAL LIGHT—ASWEIGHT TRAINING (NOT BODYBUILDING) HAS CONTRIBUTED TO JUDO.I CAN GO ON AND ON BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO GO FOR A LUNCHEON INTERVIEW WITHMY PUBLICITY MAN. IT’S ALWAYS NICE TO HAVE SUCH DISCUSSION WITH YOU, ANDWHENEVER YOU ARE FREE DO DROP ME A LINE AND WE WILL CONTINUE WHERE WE LEFT OFF.IN THIS SUMMER IF YOU HAVE TIME YOU SHOULD GET TOGETHER WITH TAKY AND EXCHANGEIDEAS WITH HIM. I’M SURE YOU WILL FIND IT INTERESTING.MY BEST TO AMY AND THE KIDS—HAVE YOU SEEN ANY GOOD SAMURAI MOVIES? WATCH FOR ABLIND SWORDSMAN MOVIE, IT’S GREAT.TAKE GOOD CARE AND HAVE FUN WITH YOUR WORK.BRUCEP.S. WILL YOU PLEASE FIND OUT FOR ME REGARDING THIS MR. LEE CAMERON—WITHOUT THECAMERON I WOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FOR MY COUNTRYMAN.TO GEORGE LEEGEORGE,I HEARD FROM JAMES THAT YOU DIDN’T FEEL GOOD. I HOPE YOU ARE MUCH BETTER BY NOW.TAKE CARE MY FRIEND,BRUCETO WILLIAM DOZIER30 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb30]JUNE 21, 1966DEAR MR. DOZIER,SIMPLICITY—TO EXPRESS THE UTMOST IN THE MINIMUM OF LINES AND ENERGY—IS THE GOALOF GUNG FU, AND ACTING IS NOT TOO MUCH DIFFERENT.SINCE THE FIRST EPISODE [OF “THE GREEN HORNET”], I’VE GAINED ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.I’VE LEARNED TO BE “SIMPLY HUMAN” WITHOUT UNNECESSARY STRIVING. I BELIEVE INKATO AND AM TRUTHFULLY JUSTIFYING THE PHYSICAL ACTION ECONOMICALLY.ACTUALLY, WHAT I [WOULD] LIKE TO EXPRESS HERE IS REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN THE GREEN HORNET AND KATO. TRUE THAT KATO IS A HOUSE BOY OF BRITT, BUTAS THE CRIME FIGHTER, KATO IS AN “ACTIVE PARTNER” OF THE GREEN HORNET AND NOT A“MUTE FOLLOWER.”31 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb31]JEFF COREY AGREES, AND I MYSELF FEEL THAT AT LEAST AN OCCASIONAL DIALOGUE WOULDCERTAINLY MAKE ME “FEEL” MORE AT HOME WITH THE FELLOW PLAYERS. IT DOES TAKE AREAL PRO TO JUST STAND THERE IN BIG CLOSE-UPS. I’VE LEARNED THE EFFECTIVENESS OFSIMPLICITY, BUT IN ORDER TO CULTIVATE SIMPLICITY, SOMETHING TO SAY OR DO ISNECESSARY—FROM FIRMNESS COMES GENTLENESS, AND COMPLEXITY LEADS TO SIMPLICITY.HOWEVER, ALONE STANDING THERE APART FROM THE FELLOW PLAYERS LISTENING, IS ITSELFSIMPLICITY STRIPPED TO THE VERY END. THAT REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE SKILL BECAUSE ITIS SIMPLE!I’VE PRESENTED TWO [“GREEN HORNET”] SCRIPTS TO JEFF COREY, BUT SO FAR WE’VE BEENDOING OTHER EXERCISES BECAUSE THERE JUST ISN’T ANYTHING IN THE SCRIPT TO WORKON.I’M NOT COMPLAINING, BUT I FEEL THAT AN “ACTIVE PARTNERSHIP” WITH THE GREENHORNET WILL DEFINITELY BRING OUT A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT KATO. MY AIM ISFOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE SHOW AND I BOTHER YOU WITH THIS BECAUSE YOU [HAVE]BEEN MOST UNDERSTANDING.THANK YOU VERY MUCH.SINCERELY,BRUCE LEETO VICKI32 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#bb32]DEAR VICKI,THE ART I USE ON TV IS NOT KARATE. IT IS THE ANCESTOR OF KARATE AND IS KNOWN ASGUNG FU, WHICH IS OF CHINESE ORIGIN (SO IS KARATE).BREAKING BOARDS AND BRICKS ARE MERE STUNTS AND ARE NOT RECOMMENDABLE FOR ANYONE,ESPECIALLY A GIRL LIKE YOU.

LET FRED SATO AND DIFFERENT FRIENDS KNOW OF THIS COMING EPISODE, “THEPREYING MANTIS.”NOTES1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b1]. TAKY KIMURA WAS ONE OF BRUCE LEE’S DEAREST FRIENDSAND ALSO ONE OF HIS FIRST STUDENTS. IN FACT, BRUCE LEE THOUGHT SO HIGHLY OFTAKY’S ABILITIES AND CHARACTER THAT HE MADE HIM ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR AT HISSEATTLE SCHOOL. HE SENT TAKY THE FOLLOWING CARDS, CONTAINING WHAT HE CONSIDEREDESSENTIAL POINTS IN THE “PROCESS IN LEARNING GUNG FU.” WHICH FOCUS ON THEPHILOSOPHICAL OR “HIGHER” ASPECTS OF THE ART, RATHER THAN ON THE PURELYCOMBATIVE.2 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b2]. BILL EVANS WAS AN EDITOR AT BLACK BELT MAGAZINE INTHE EARLY 1960S.3 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b3]. LIKE BRUCE LEE,WILLIAM CHEUNG WAS A STUDENT OF YIPMAN. HE WAS ALSO BRUCE’S CHILDHOOD FRIEND.4 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b4]. BRUCE HAD RETURNED TO HONG KONG IN THE SUMMER OF1963 WITH ONE OF HIS GUNG FU STUDENTS, DOUG PALMER.5 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b5]. THE “FELLOW” IS BRUCE’S STUDENT, JAMES YIMM LEE.IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED, BRUCE AND LINDA MOVED IN WITH HIM AND LIVEDWITH HIM FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. JAMES WAS THE ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR AT BRUCE’S JUNFAN GUNG FU INSTITUTE IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA.6 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b6]. THE BOOK BRUCE LEE IS REFERRING TO IS CHINESE GUNGFU: THE PHILOSOPHICAL ART OF SELF-DEFENSE, WHICH WAS SELF-PUBLISHED IN 1963. (ITHAS BEEN REISSUED BY OHARA PUBLICATIONS, SANTA CLARITA, CALIFORNIA.)7 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b7]. BRUCE LEE’S THE TOO OF GUNG FU IS VOLUME TWO IN THEBRUCE LEE LIBRARY SERIES (BOSTON: CHARLES E.TUTTLE CO., 1997).8 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b8]. EVEN TODAY, TAKY KIMURA LAUGHS:> I THOUGHT THAT I COULD IMPRESS BRUCE IF I SIGNED OFF THE LETTER IN CHINESE.> I’M OF JAPANESE PERSUASION MYSELF, SO I DIDN’T KNOW THAT MUCH CHINESE. FOR> SOME REASON THOUGH, I GOT SEE-HING (YOUR SENIOR, ONE WHO LEARNED BEFORE YOU)> CONFUSED WITH SEE-DAI (YOUR JUNIOR, ONE WHO LEARNED AFTER YOU). FORTUNATELY,> BRUCE HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IT, AND REALIZED THAT I WASN’T TRYING TO> BE A SMART-ALECK, BUT SIMPLY GOT MY TERMS MIXED UP—I HAD A HARD TIME LIVING> THIS ONE DOWN, THOUGH.9 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b9]. THE THREE FORMS OF WING CHUN ARE SIL LIM TAO(“LITTLE IMAGINATION”), CHUM KIU (“SEARCHING FOR THE BRIDGE”), AND BIU GEE(“FLYING FINGERS”).10 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b10]. BRUCE LEE SOUGHT THE “ULTIMATE” CONNECTINGPRINCIPLE, OR THE “ROOT” THAT CONNECTED ALL EFFICIENT MARTIAL TECHNIQUES (ANDLATER ON ALL SPIRITUAL TRUTHS) THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT OF HIS MARTIAL ART, ANDTHE EVOLUTION AND EXPRESSION OF JEET KUNE DO. (SEE ALSO JEET KUNE DO: BRUCELEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIAL WAY, VOLUME THREE IN THE BRUCE LEE LIBRARY,PP. 385-86.)11 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b11]. THE “FIVE WAYS OF ATTACK” ARE: SIMPLE ANGLE ATTACK(SAA), ATTACK BY DRAWING (ABD), ATTACK BY COMBINATION (ABC), PROGRESSIVEINDIRECT ATTACK (PIA), AND HAND- OR HAIR-IMMOBILIZATION ATTACK (HIA).THIS LASTATTACK ALSO INCLUDED IMMOBILIZATION ATTACKS ON THE LEGS OR LEG-IMMOBILIZATIONATTACKS (LIA). (SEE ALSO JEET KUNE DO: BRUCE LEE’S COMMENTARIES ON THE MARTIALWAY, VOLUME THREE IN THE BRUCE LEE LIBRARY, PP. 103-25.)12 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b12]. “OLD CHARLES” IS CHARLIE WOO, A FRIEND AND STUDENTOF BRUCE’S FROM HIS EARLY YEARS IN SEATTLE. CHARLIE DIED AT A TRAGICALLY EARLYAGE FROM INJURIES RESULTING FROM A HORSEBACK RIDING ACCIDENT.13 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b13]. ON FEBRUARY 8, 1965, BRUCE LEE’S FATHER, LEE HOICHUEN, PASSED AWAY IN HONG KONG. BRUCE WAS SUMMONED FOR THE FUNERAL SERVICE ANDPENNED THE FOLLOWING LETTERS HOME TO HIS WIFE, LINDA, DURING HIS STAY IN HONGKONG.14 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b14]. AS LINDA AND BRUCE COULD NOT AFFORD “REAL” WEDDINGRINGS WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED, HE HAD PROMISED TO PICK UP A REAL DIAMOND RING ASSOON AS POSSIBLE.15 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b15]. “DICKIE” WAS JAMES YIMM LEE’S STEPSON.16 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b16]. “BO BO” WAS THE NAME OF JAMES YIMM LEE’S DOG, ABOXER. LATER, BRUCE AND LINDA HAD A GREAT DANE NAMED BO, WHO PROVED TO BE A VERYHIGH-MAINTENANCE ANIMAL.17 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b17]. MAS OYAMA, THE FAMED JAPANESE KARATE MASTER.18 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b18]. BRUCE WAS ALREADY TEACHING HIS NONCLASSICAL GUNGFU OUT OF THE JUN FAN GUNG FU INSTITUTE. THE “STYLE” THAT HE CREATED WHILE HEWAS BACK IN HONG KONG WAS “THE JUN FAN METHOD.” IN 1967, HE WOULD OFFICIALLYRECHRISTEN IT JEET KUNE DO (THE WAY OF THE INTERCEPTING FIST) AND, SHORTLYTHEREAFTER, COME TO DISBELIEVE IN THE NOTION OF STYLES OR SCHOOLS OF MARTIAL ARTALTOGETHER, WHICH HE CONSIDERED TO BE DIVISIVE AND OBSTRUCTIONAL TO ANINDIVIDUAL’S SEARCH FOR TRUTH IN MARTIAL ART. FOR THIS REASON, HE CLOSED ALL OFHIS MARTIAL ART SCHOOLS IN JANUARY 1970.19 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b19]. THE BY-JONG IS THE READY STANCE OR READY POSITIONIN GUNG FU. BRUCE INITIALLY USED THE TERM TO REFER TO THE CLASSICAL COMBATIVESTANCE OF WING CHUN. HE LATER DROPPED THIS STANCE IN FAVOR OF THE MORE FLUIDON-GUARD POSITION OF JEET KUNE DO.20 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b20]. THE SAND PEBBLES WAS A MOVIE STARRING BRUCE’SFUTURE STUDENT STEVE MCQUEEN. BRUCE DID NOT GET THE PART (PRESUMABLY THESUPPORTING ROLE OF THE MALE ASIAN BOXER), WHICH WENT INSTEAD TO THEJAPANESE-AMERICAN ACTOR, MAKO.21 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b21]. JAMES YIMM LEE WAS ONE OF BRUCE LEE’S CLOSESTFRIENDS AND A VERY CAPABLE MARTIAL ARTIST IN HIS OWN RIGHT.22 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b22]. “CHOP SUEY” WAS BRUCE’S JOKING NAME FOR THE TYPEOF MARTIAL ARTIST WHO WAS DETERMINED TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW SIMPLY BY COMBININGRANDOM COMPONENTS OF ALL SORTS OF CHINESE GUNG FU STYLES, WITHOUT PAYING PROPERATTENTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF SIMPLICITY, DIRECTNESS, AND EFFICIENCY. (SEE ALSOTHE TAO OF GUNG FU, VOLUME TWO OF THE BRUCE LEE LIBRARY, PAGE 166.)23 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b23]. THE “RUNNER” WAS THE NAME THAT BRUCE LEE GAVE TO ACHINESE MARTIAL ARTIST WHO, ALONG WITH THREE OTHER CHINESE MARTIAL ARTISTS,SHOWED UP AT HIS KWOON ONE DAY IN 1964 AND DELIVERED AN ULTIMATUM: EITHER STOPTEACHING NON-CHINESE THE ART OF GUNG FU, OR ACCEPT A CHALLENGE TO FIGHT. LEEACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE BUT, AS SOON AS THE FIGHT BEGAN, THE CHALLENGER ACTUALLYTURNED AND RAN AWAY. BRUCE LEE CHASED HIM ALL AROUND THE KWOON, FINALLY CAUGHTUP WITH HIM, AND FORCED HIM INTO SUBMISSION. HOWEVER, LEE FELT TREMENDOUSLYWINDED FROM ALL THE RUNNING AND THIS LED HIM TO REFORMULATE HIS VIEWS OF MARTIALART. IT PROVED TO BE THE GENESIS OF HIS PERSONAL ART, JEET KUNE DO.24 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b24]. GEORGE LEE WAS ONE OF BRUCE LEE’S EARLIESTSTUDENTS AS WELL AS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND. HE ALSO HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE MOSTTALENTED CRAFTSMEN WHOM BRUCE LEE EVER MET. THE TWO FORGED A CLOSE FRIENDSHIPAND GEORGE BUILT MOST OF BRUCE LEE’S TRAINING EQUIPMENT AND ARTISTICREPRESENTATIONS OF HIS MARTIAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL BELIEFS.25 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b25]. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BRUCE LEE’S IDEAS ANDINNOVATIONS CONCERNING ADDING “REALISM” TO COMBAT TRAINING GAVE BIRTH TO THENOTION OF REALITY-ORIENTED MARTIAL ART SCHOOLS, AND EVEN TO SPORTS SUCH AS “FULLCONTACT KARATE.”26 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b26]. FRED SATO WAS A JUDO MAN AND A FRIEND OF BRUCE’SFROM SEATTLE.27 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b27]. GREENWAY PRODUCTIONS, THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCED“THE GREEN HORNET” TV SERIES, HAD SIGNED BRUCE TO PLAY KATO SEVERAL WEEKS PRIORTO SIGNING VAN WILLIAMS TO PLAY THE GREEN HORNET.28 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b28]. BATMAN AND ROBIN WERE PLAYED BY ADAM WEST AND BURTWARD, RESPECTIVELY.29 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b29]. KI IS JAPANESE FOR THE CHINESE TERM CHI, OR “INNERENERGY.”30 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b30]. WILLIAM DOZIER WAS THE PRODUCER OF “THE GREENHORNET” TELEVISION SERIES.31 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b31]. BRITT REID WAS THE GREEN HORNET’S ALTER-EGO IN THETV SERIES.32 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#b32]. VICKI WAS EVIDENTLY A YOUNG FAN OF “THE GREENHORNET” WHICH PREMIERED ON SEPTEMBER 9, 1966, AND RAN UNTIL JULY 14, 1967. VICKIHAD WRITTEN TO ASK BRUCE WHETHER THE MARTIAL ART THAT KATO USED WAS KARATE ANDWHAT WAS THE BEST WAY TO BREAK A BRICK WITH HER HAND.Image [../Images/84a.jpg]* [../Text/Part2.xhtml#p2ss1]NOTES FOR PART 2 BEGIN ON PAGE 81 [Part2.xhtml#n2].* [../Text/Part2.xhtml#p2ss2]THAT IS, IF BRUCE WERE TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THELESSONS PERSONALLY, HE WOULD TELL THEM HE HAD MASTERED IT ALREADY IN ORDER TOAVOID PAYING WHAT WAS THEN A VERY HIGH FEE."},{"pageContent":"PART 3JEET KUNE DO AND THE ART OF CULTIVATING OPTIMISM(1967-1970)Image [../Images/part.jpg]1967TO GEORGE LEETUESDAY, JANUARY 31, 1967GEORGE,I’VE BEEN SHOOTING “BATMAN” THESE [PAST] FEW DAYS AND [HAVE BEEN] BUSY LIKEHELL. I BELIEVE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND TIME TO SHOW YOUR BOY AND HIS FRIENDSAROUND THE STUDIO THIS COMING FRIDAY.THE OKLAHOMA APPEARANCE WAS GREAT AND I’M ASKED BACK FOR ANOTHER ONE IN GEORGIA.THAT SIGN YOU MADE HAS CREATED QUITE A HIT—EVERYONE ADMIRES YOUR TALENT. IF YOUHAVE TIME, I’D LIKE TO MAKE TWO REQUESTS FOR SOME STUFFS THAT YOU CAN MAKE FORME. THEY ARE GADGETS TO PUT MY SYSTEM ACROSS.FIRST, I [WOULD] LIKE THREE SIGNS FOR HANGING, LIKE PICTURES ON A WALL—SLIGHTLYSMALLER THAN THE SIGN YOU MADE FOR ME. HERE ARE THE PLANS & IDEAS—THIS PROJECTBY THE WAY IS TO ILLUSTRATE THE THOUGHT BEHIND MY SYSTEM—THE 3 STAGES.Image [../Images/86a.jpg]EXPLANATION FOR THE THREE SIGNS(SAME BLACK SHINING BACKGROUND AS THE SIGN YOU MADE)FIRST SIGNHERE ALL WE NEED IS ONE RED HALF AND ONE GOLD HALF OF THE YIN YANG SYMBOL.HOWEVER NO DOT IS NEEDED ON EITHER HALF; IN OTHER WORD, IT IS JUST PLAIN REDWITH NO GOLD DOT, OR JUST PLAIN GOLD WITH NO RED DOT (THIS SERVES TO ILLUSTRATEEXTREME SOFTNESS OR/AND EXTREME HARDNESS). SO JUST FOLLOW THE DRAWING AND ALSOPUT THE PHRASE—PARTIALITY—THE RUNNING TO EXTREME ON THE BLACK BOARD.SECOND SIGNEXACT YIN YANG SYMBOL LIKE THE SIGN YOU MADE FOR ME EXCEPT THERE IS NO CHINESECHARACTERS AROUND THE SYMBOL. OF COURSE, THE PHRASE—FLUIDITY—THE TWO HALVES OFONE WHOLE WILL BE ON THE BLACK BOARD.THIRD SIGNJUST A SHINY BLACK BOARD WITH NOTHING ON IT EXCEPT THE PHRASE EMPTINESS—THEFORMLESS FORM.THE THREE SIGNS HAVE TO BE THE SAME SIZE BECAUSE THEY ILLUSTRATE THE THREESTAGES OF CULTIVATION. PLEASE DO MAKE THEM LIKE THE SIGN YOU MADE FOR ME;ALUMINUM SYMBOL AND SHINY BLACK BOARD.THE SECOND GADGET I HAVE IN MIND IS USED TO DRAMATIZE THE NOT TOO ALIVE WAY OFTHE CLASSICAL SO CALLED KUNG FU STYLES. WHAT I HAVE IN MIND IS A MINIATURE“TOMBSTONE” AND HERE IS THE DRAWING:Image [../Images/87a.jpg]Image [../Images/87b.jpg]MINIATURE “TOMBSTONE” MADE BY GEORGE LEE BASED ON BRUCE LEE’S DRAWING (LEFT).I’M SURE YOU KNOW HOW A GRAVE LOOKS LIKE AND MAKE IT WITH ANY MATERIAL YOU LIKE(ALUMINUM TOMBSTONE IS FINE) AND AT ANY SIZE YOU WANT.

INCOMPARISON TO A HUMAN HEAD, THE WIDTH 7¼\" IS FROM EAR TO EAR, THE HEIGHT OF 3 ISFROM FOREHEAD TO TOP OF NOSE, AND THE DEEPNESS OF 1½\" IS FROM FRONT OF HEAD TOBACK OF HEAD. NOW TO THE BOTTOM PART, THE NECK, AS ON A HUMAN. THE HEIGHT, 31/8”IS FROM UNDERCHIN TO BOTTOM OF NECK ABOVE COLLAR BONE, THE WIDTH 6 IS FROM THEEND OF NECK TO THE OTHER, AND THE DEEPNESS OF 21/8” IS FROM THROAT TO THE BACKOF NECK.ALL THE ABOVE MEASUREMENTS ARE MADE WITHOUT PADDING, IN OTHER WORDS, THE EXACTMEASUREMENT ON THE EQUIPMENT. ANOTHER THING I LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT FOR THETOP, THE HOOD IS COVERING OVER THE HEAD; HOWEVER, FOR THE BOTTOM, THE HOOD HASTO COVER THE NECK INVERTED; IN OTHER WORDS, BOTTOM UP.THANK YOU ONCE MORE FOR EVERYTHING.THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH,BRUCETO GEORGE LEEDEAR GEORGE,TOO BAD YOU AREN’T HERE.

IT’S A HELL OF A JOBBUT I MUST TAKE TIME OUT TO ONCE MORE THANK YOU FOR THAT MAGNIFICENT JOB YOU DIDON THAT FINGER JAB EQUIPMENT.I’VE ALREADY HEARD FROM JAMES THAT THE BASE FOR THE LEG STRETCHER WILL BETERRIFIC. ACTUALLY I NEED NOT HAVE HIM TO INFORM ME ON THAT. MAN, LIKEEVERYTHING YOU TOUCH HAS TO BE BEAUTIFUL OR ELSE YOU WON’T DELIVER IT.I’M FLYING UP THIS WEEKEND, GIVE ME A CALL AT JAMES’ AND WE’LL GET TOGETHER. IWILL SHARPEN AT LEAST ONE OF YOUR TECHNIQUES WITH MY NEWLY FOUND TRAININGMETHOD.OKAY, GEORGE. TAKE CARE MY FRIEND,BRUCETO TAKY KIMURA8 [../Text/Part3.xhtml#cc8]TAKY,I’VE JUST RUSHED THE TAI KIK WALL CHART FORM TO YOU. ENCLOSED IN THE PARCEL WASA CHINESE JACKET.AS I’VE MENTIONED, I’VE JUST GOT BACK FROM OAKLAND AND JAMES LEE IS GOING TOSEND YOU A LOP SAO APPARATUS WITH BUILT-IN RESISTANCE.FIRST AND FOREMOST, I LIKE TO IMPRESS A MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF TEACHING IN YOURMIND, AND THAT IS THE ECONOMY OF FORM. FOLLOW THIS RULE AND YOU WILL NEVER FEELLIKE YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE AND MORE SO-CALLED “SIZZLING” TECHNIQUES TO KEEP OURSTUDENTS INTERESTED.IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN “ECONOMY OF FORM,” I’LL TAKE A TECHNIQUE TO ILLUSTRATE THETHEORY. LATER ON, THIS IDEA CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY TECHNIQUE. TOGETHER WITH THEIDEA OF “THE THREE STAGES OF A TECHNIQUE” [1. SYNCHRONIZATION OF SELF, 2.SYNCHRONIZATION WITH OPPONENT, 3. UNDER FIGHTING CONDITION] THIS PROGRAM OFTEACHING NOT ONLY PROVIDES AN ENDLESS ROUTINE OF INSTRUCTION, BUT A MOSTEFFICIENT LESSON PLAN THAT WILL BRING RESULTS TO ALL STUDENTS. I’VE TESTED THEMHERE IN LA AND DISREGARD HOW LITTLE WE SHOW EACH TIME, THE STUDENTS’ INTEREST ISKEPT UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ELIMINATE THE EXTRA MOTIONS INVOLVED, AND THEY FEELGREAT DOING IT. ALL RIGHT, BACK TO THE IDEA OF “ECONOMY OF FORM.”TO ILLUSTRATE THE IDEA, I’LL TAKE THE PAK SAO (SLAPPING HAND)— BASICALLY,“ECONOMY OF MOTION” MEANS ALL MOTIONS START FROM THE BY-JONG POSITION; SECONDLY,HANDS ARE TO MOVE FIRST IF IT IS A HAND TECHNIQUE [FOOT FOLLOWS], FEET FIRST IFIT IS A FOOT TECHNIQUE.SO, EMPHASIZE THE ABOVE “TWO TRUTHS” BY PRACTICING PAK SAO FIRST IN THE TOUCHINGHAND MANNER—IN OTHER WORDS, STUDENTS IN BAIJONG POSITION TOUCHING EACH OTHER’SHAND—THOUGH IN REAL COMBAT, ONE WILL NEVER START BY TOUCHING HAND, HOWEVER, THISTOUCHING HAND POSITION WILL ENSURE CORRECT FORM IN THE BEGINNING STAGE—ECONOMYOF FORM, THAT IS.EACH STUDENT MUST ATTACK [IN UNISON] FROM THE BAIJONG WITHOUT ANY WASTED MOTION.NOW THIS HAS BEEN AN OVERLOOKED BASIC THEORY OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IF ANYSTUDENT DOES HIS PAK SAO [OR ANY TECHNIQUE FOR THAT MATTER] WITH WASTED MOTION,BACK TO THE TOUCHING HAND POSITION HE GOES TO MINIMIZE HIS UNNECESSARY MOTIONS.SO YOU SEE THAT IN ORDER TO PROGRESS TO APPLY PAK SAO FROM A DISTANCE, THISTOUCHING HAND POSITION HAS TO BE MASTERED. NOT ONLY THAT, THE STUDENT HAS TORETURN TO THE TOUCHING HAND POSITION TO REMIND HIM TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARYMOTION PERIODICALLY.FROM A DISTANCE, PAK SAO IS A LOT HARDER—WITHOUT ANY GIVEN AWAY MOTION, ONE MUSTINITIATE FIRST HAND, THEN FEET, IN A PROGRESSIVE, HARMONIOUS FORWARD MOTION—NOWONDER NOT TOO MANY CAN HIT WITH A SINGLE PAK SAO! DO YOU NOT SEE NOW THE IDEAOF ECONOMY OF MOTION? JUST THIS ONE THEORY OF ECONOMY OF MOTION TAKES UP ONEHECK OF A LOT OF TIME FOR PERFECTION, NOT TO MENTION THE “THREE STAGES OF ATECHNIQUE”—THAT IS, IN TERMS OF PAK SAO, AFTER LEARNING AND MASTERING PAK SAOFROM A DISTANCE, ONE HAS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN [ONESELF AND ONE’S] OPPONENTWITH A KICK—TO CLOSE IN SAFELY.A MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF TEACHING... IS THE ECONOMY OF FORM. FOLLOW THIS RULEAND YOU WILL NEVER FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO ADD MORE AND MORE SO-CALLED “SIZZLING”TECHNIQUES TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS INTERESTED.FOLLOWING THE ABOVE SUGGESTION WILL GIVE YOU ENDLESS HOURS OF INSTRUCTION. OFCOURSE, YOU MUST USE THE SET SYSTEM, THAT IS REPETITION OF EACH TECHNIQUE INSETS FOR PERFECTION. YOU BEGIN NOW IMMEDIATELY TO WORK ON WHAT I MENTIONED ANDAPPLY ALL YOU’VE LEARNED WITH ECONOMY OF MOTION—YOU WILL DOUBLE YOUR SPEED ANDSKILL DOING JUST THAT.I HOPE I HAVE IMPRESSED IN YOUR MIND A MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF OUR STYLE—STICK TOTHE PROGRAM I’VE GIVEN YOU, USE VARIETY, AND DO NOT WORRY TOO MUCH THAT YOURSTUDENTS NEED MORE AND MORE TO STAY WITH YOU—TRUE [ONLY] IF THEY CAN DOPERFECTLY ALL YOU’VE TAUGHT THEM.REMEMBER THE IDEA THAT ONE HAS TO COME IN THOUSANDS OF TIMES IN ORDER TO PERFECTONE JUDO THROW. AND, OF COURSE, USE YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND IMAGINATION. YOUWILL DO WELL. I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.BRUCEImage [../Images/100a.jpg]THIS CHART, DRAFTED BY BRUCE LEE AND SENT TO TAKY KIMURA ABOUT 1967, EXPLAINSTHE SCHEMATIC OF COMBAT AND FEATURES THE “FIVE WAYS OF ATTACK” OF JEET KUNE DO.TO TAKY KIMURASEPTEMBER 11, 1967TAKY,QUARTERLY CARD FOR WINTER (SEPT. 21-DEC. 21, 1967).

BOX 5109BEVERLY HILLSCALIF. 90210IT’S BECAUSE I HAVE BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE.TO LEO FONGLEO,HERE ARE SOME HISTORICAL FACTS ON THE CHOY LAY FUT STYLE. REMEMBER THAT THETERMS ARE MAINLY OF CANTONESE ORIGIN. THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN; TOOK ME SOMETIME.CHOY LAY FUT WAS FOUNDED BY CHAN HEUNG IN KWANG TUNG PROVINCE. LIKE MANY OF THESOUTHERN CHINESE YOUTHS, HE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO THE POPULAR SOUTHERN SIL LUMSTYLE OF HUNG KUEN BY HIS UNCLE. LATER ON, HE TRAINED WITH A LAY (OR LEE) YAUSAAN. STILL YEARNING FOR MORE KNOWLEDGE, HE WENT TO MT. LAW FOW AND SOUGHT OUTTHE MONK CHOY FOOK.BEFORE LONG, CHAN HEUNG WAS TO COMBINE ALL HIS LEARNING TO FORM HIS OWN STYLE,AND NAMED IT THE CHOY LAY FUT STYLE. TO HONOR HIS PREVIOUS INSTRUCTORS, HE NAMEDHIS STYLE AFTER THEM. CHOY WAS NAMED AFTER MONK CHOY FOOK, LAY, AFTER LAY YAUSAAN, AND FINALLY, BECAUSE HUNG KUEN IS ONE OF THE MANY BRANCHES OF THE SIL LUMBUDDHIST TEMPLE, THUS THE TERM FUT (BUDDHIST) IS ADOPTED.CHOY LAY FUT IS ESSENTIALLY A LONG-RANGE STYLE OF BOXING, RELYING ON A STRONG“HORSE” (STANCE), AND IS KNOWN FOR ITS JOINT-LOCKING TECHNIQUES, THE BACKFIST,THE DOWNWARD SWING AND THE KNUCKLE FIST.THERE ARE MANY EMPTY-HAND SETS (FORMS) IN THIS SOUTHERN STYLE: THE LONG-RANGEFIST, BUDDHIST FIST, T’AI, PING, TEEN GOK FISTS, ETC.

HOW ARE YOU? ALAN SHAW’SLETTER FROM CANADA ASKS ME TO LEND YOU MY 8MM FILM. I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT ISBECAUSE I HAVE LOST IT WHEN I MOVED MY HOME. THAT FILM IS ALREADY VERY OLD AND ISELDOM USE IT, SO I HAVE LOST IT. I AM SORRY FOR IT.NOW I HAVE BOUGHT A HOUSE IN BEL-AIR. IT IS ABOUT HALF AN ACRE. THERE ARE MANYTREES. IT HAS THE TASTE OF A RANGE. IT IS LOCATED ON A HILL TOP NEAR BEVERLYHILLS. MOREOVER, BESIDES MY SON BRANDON, I HAVE HAD A DAUGHTER, SHANNON, WHO ISSEVEN MONTHS OLD. HAVE YOU RE-MARRIED? PLEASE SEND MY REGARDS TO YOUR SISTERS.RECENTLY, I HAVE ORGANIZED A FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY. I HAVE ALSO WRITTEN ASTORY “THE SILENT FLUTE.” JAMES COBURN AND I WILL ACT IN IT. STIRLING SILLIPHANTIS THE SCREEN PLAY WRITER. HE IS A FAMOUS SCREEN PLAY WRITER (IN THE HEAT OF THENIGHT). WE PLAN TO MAKE THE FIRST MARTIAL ARTS FILM IN HOLLYWOOD. THE PROSPECTIS GOOD. ABOUT SIX MONTHS FROM NOW, THE FILMING WORK WILL BEGIN. ALL WHOPARTICIPATE IN THIS FILM ARE MY STUDENTS. IN THE FUTURE, STEVE MCQUEEN MAY ALSOWORK TOGETHER WITH ME. I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PLAN.AS TO MARTIAL ART, I STILL PRACTICE DAILY. I TEACH MY STUDENTS AND FRIENDS TWICEA WEEK. IT DOESN’T MATTER IF THEY ARE WESTERN BOXERS, TAE KWON DO PRACTITIONERSOR WRESTLERS, I WILL TEACH THEM AS LONG AS THEY ARE FRIENDLY AND WILL NOT GETUPTIGHT.SINCE I STARTED TO PRACTICE REALISTICALLY IN 1966 (PROTECTORS, GLOVES, ETC.) IFEEL THAT I HAD MANY PREJUDICES BEFORE, AND THEY ARE WRONG. SO I CHANGED THENAME OF THE GIST OF MY STUDY TO JEET KUNE DO. JEET KUNE DO IS ONLY A NAME. THEMOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO AVOID HAVING BIAS IN TRAINING. OF COURSE, I RUN EVERYDAY, I PRACTICE MY TOOLS (PUNCH, KICK, THROW, ETC.). I HAVE TO RAISE THE BASICCONDITIONS DAILY. ALTHOUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF BOXING IS IMPORTANT, PRACTICALITY ISEVEN MORE IMPORTANT.I THANK YOU AND MASTER [YIP MAN] FOR TEACHING ME THE WAYS OF WING CHUN IN HONGKONG. ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR LEADING ME TO WALK ON A PRACTICAL ROAD.ESPECIALLY IN THE STATES, THERE ARE WESTERN BOXERS, I OFTEN PRACTICE WITH THEM,TOO. THERE ARE MANY SO-CALLED MASTERS IN WING CHUN HERE, I REALLY HOPE THAT THEYWILL NOT BE SO BLIND [AS] TO FIGHT WITH THOSE WESTERN BOXERS!I MAY MAKE A TRIP TO HONG KONG. I HOPE THAT YOU ARE STILL LIVING IN THE SAMEPLACE. WE ARE INTIMATE FRIENDS, WE NEED TO MEET MORE AND CHAT ABOUT OUR PASTDAYS. THAT WILL BE A LOT OF FUN, DON’T YOU THINK? WHEN YOU SEE MASTER YIP,PLEASE SEND MY REGARDS TO HIM.HAPPINESS BE WITH YOU,BRUCE LEETO JHOON GOO RHEETHE FOLLOWING LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY BRUCE LEE TO HIS FRIEND JHOON RHEE WITH SOMEIDEAS ON HOW TO PRODUCE A TELEVISION SHOW ON SELF-DEFENSE FOR WOMEN.JHOON GOO,HERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS THAT ENTER MY MIND AFTER OUR PHONE CONVERSATION.BACKGROUND FOR PROGRAMA) LIGHT ORIENTAL BACKGROUND MUSIC WHICH BECOMES LOUDER BEFORE AND AFTERPROGRAM.B) THE SETTING HAS TO BE SIMPLE ORIENTAL DESIGN WITH MATS AND ALL—MOST IMPORTANTYOUR OWN SCHOOL EMBLEM (BIG!) IN THE BACKGROUND.COSTUMESA) YOU THE HEAD INSTRUCTOR WEAR GI AT ALL TIME.23 [../Text/Part3.xhtml#cc23]B) THE LADY WEARS DIFFERENT STREET CLOTHES.SITUATIONA) REALISTIC DUPLICATION OF ACTUAL ATTACK (NOTE: WHOEVER THE ATTACKER, HE MUSTBE FIERCE AND ROUGH TOWARD HIS VICTIM).B) PROVIDE PROPS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO CAPTURE THE STREET SCENE—LIKE CHAIR,PHONY CAR, ETC., ETC.LESSONS1. TAKE ONE TECHNIQUE AT A TIME AND SHOW IT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES ANDPERSPECTIVES SO AS NOT TO MAKE THE LESSON MONOTONOUS.2. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE PROGRAM HAS TO BE BOTH EDUCATIONAL ANDENTERTAINING—REALIZE THE FACT THAT [BEING] TOO EDUCATIONAL WILL MAKE THE SHOWTOO DULL; ON THE OTHER HAND, TOO ENTERTAINING WILL DECREASE THE MARTIAL ARTSPIRIT. HOWEVER, THOUGH A HAPPY MEDIUM IS DESIRED, FOR A TV PROGRAM, DO LEANTOWARD SHOWMANSHIP.3. BESIDES YOUR USUAL LESSON PLANS, DO GIVE BRIEF LECTURES ON SAFETY AT HOME, INA CAR, WALKING ALONE ON THE STREET, ETC., ETC.4. DO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CURRENT [NEWS]PAPER CLIPPINGS OF ATTACKS SO AS TOINSTILL FEAR THAT WILL LEAD TO TAKING ACTUAL LESSONS. GET AS MUCH STATISTICS ASYOU CAN ON CRIMES, ATTACKS, ETC. AND REPORT IT ON THE AIR.5. DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE THE VIEWER TO WRITE IN.6. AS THE PROGRAM GOES ON, YOU SHOULD SELL SOME OF YOUR PRODUCTS—BOOKS, ORWHATEVER ITEMS YOU FEEL WOULD HELP THE LADIES.SOME THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED1. YOU MUST SECURE OWNERSHIP OF YOUR FILM PILOT NO MATTER [IF] IT SELLS OR NOT.2. MAKE YOUR PROGRAM A PACKAGE DEAL WITH YOU AS THE HIRING FORCE FOR WHATEVERASSISTANTS YOU HAVE ON THE SHOW.3. I WOULD RECOMMEND—IF IT DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH POLICY—THAT YOU HAVE THE GIRLPLUS THE ATTACKERS SO THAT YOU BECOME THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SHOW WHILE THOSE TWOARE DEMONSTRATORS. OF COURSE YOU WILL OCCASIONALLY DEMONSTRATE ON THE ATTACKERAS TO THE PROPER AND CORRECT WAY OF EXECUTION.4. HAVE [THE] LAWYER CONSULT THE SCREEN GUILD AS TO [THE] UNION’S POLICY ON YOURTYPE OF SHOW. DO THIS WHEN CONCRETE DEAL IS BEING MADE.WHAT MORE CAN I SAY AT THIS TIME BUT TO WISH YOU THE BEST AND HOPE THE SHOW WILLMATERIALIZE. SHOULD I COME UP WITH ANY MORE IDEAS, I’LL WRITE YOU.SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE PILOT HERE IN THE WEST COAST. I SHOULD BE OF HELP.BRUCETO GEORGE LEEGEORGE,A MASTERPIECE INDEED!MY APPRECIATION MY FRIEND—NOT ONLY TO THE WORKMANSHIP (THAT IS ALWAYS TOPS!)

THIS IS QUITE IRONICAL.AT THIS TIME I CANNOT GO TO SINGAPORE BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MUCH WORK TO DO.PERSONALLY, I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE JOINED SUCH A GRAND GATHERING.BUT NOW, EVERYTHING IS OVER.THIS SOUNDS A BIT COLD, BUT I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE ONCE AGAIN THAT THESE WORDS AREFROM MY HEART. I HOPE THAT YOU CAN TELL THE SINGAPORE NATIONAL PUGILISTICFEDERATION THAT I AM SORRY.NOW I AM PREPARING TO SHOOT A NEW FILM, DIRECTED AND ACTED BY MYSELF.

WILL BE MY BASE OF OPERATIONS AS MY FILMS ARE ENJOYING“UNBELIEVABLE” SUCCESS, BREAKING ALL TIME RECORDS ONE AFTER ANOTHER.THOUGH ONE MAY SAY DIFFERENT LOCALES HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES; HOWEVER, “I’MPOSITIVE” THAT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO MY GOING TOH.K. WILL PROVE TO BE A SUCCESS INTERNATIONALLY. AFTER ALL, ACTION IS ACTION,AND IF WARNER DEVELOPS SOMETHING SPECIFIC FOR ME, I’M SURE MY SPECIAL BRAND OFACTION WILL SOCK IT TO THEM. OF COURSE, MY EXPERIENCE IN ACTING HAS GROWNCONSIDERABLY SINCE “LONGSTREET” BECAUSE I HAVE GAINED FROM SHOULDERING THERESPONSIBILITY OF PLAYING THE LEADING ROLE, PLUS DIRECTING MY THIRD FILM.ACCORDING TO MY PARTNER, RAYMOND CHOW, AUBREY AND NETTING ARE COMING TO H.K.

I WOULD LIKE TO FEELYOU WOULD NOT INTERPRET THIS AS AN EGO TRIP, FOR AFTER THIS SWIFT AND UNEXPECTEDADJUSTMENT, I HAVE FOUND, AFTER MUCH SOUL SEARCHING, THAT DEEP DOWN WHAT IHONESTLY VALUE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS QUALITY: DOING ONE’S BEST IN THEMANNER OF THE RESPONSIBILITY AND CRAFTSMANSHIP OF A NUMBER ONE.SO TED, FROM ONE HUMAN BEING TO ANOTHER, AND I AM SAYING IT SIMPLY AND DIRECTLY,“I HONESTLY FEEL THAT THIS DILIGENTLY TRAINED BODY PLUS A TIME TRIED REALISTICFAITH IN KNOWING THAT I CAN ...” WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE IT AND MAKE IT IN AREALLY BIG WAY SHOULD THIS CHINAMAN GET A FAIR SEEING AND FAIR SUPPORT FROMSOMEONE.DESPITE ALL THE PRIVILEGES, THERE IS ONE UNAVOIDABLE FRUSTRATION: HONG KONG FILMINDUSTRY IS DEFINITELY BEHIND IN QUALITY AS COMPARED TO OTHER LEADING COUNTRIES.THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, AND HONESTLY FEEL IT, IS THAT THIS CHINAMAN WILLDEFINITELY INVADE THE STATES IN A BIG WAY, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. I AM SURE, IF YOUGIVE THIS MATTER A FAIR AND SERIOUS THOUGHT, SOMETHING WILL BE WORKED OUT TO OURMUTUAL BENEFIT. SHOULD THIS PROJECT COME THROUGH, WE, AS GOOD FRIENDS, WILLENJOY IT THAT MUCH MORE.I DON’T THINK I’LL BE MOVING FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS YET; AT ANY RATE, I’LL NOTIFYYOUR LOCAL MANAGER ROBERT CHAN REGARDING MY WHEREABOUTS.

HONG KONG, 1972YOU SEE, JOHN, WHEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF WORKING OUT, YOU’LL SEE THAT YOURWAY OF THINKING IS DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME AS MINE. ART, AFTER ALL, IS A MEANSOF ACQUIRING “PERSONAL” LIBERTY. YOUR WAY IS NOT MY WAY NOR MINE YOURS.SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GET TOGETHER, REMEMBER WELL THAT ART “LIVES” WHEREABSOLUTE FREEDOM IS.

YOU SHOULD KNOW ME BY NOW.AFTER READING YOUR ARTICLE ON ME, I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS. TO MANY, THE WORD“SUCCESS” SEEMS TO BE A PARADISE, BUT NOW THAT I’M IN THE MIDST OF IT, IT ISNOTHING BUT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SEEM TO COMPLICATE MY INNATE FEELING TOWARDSIMPLICITY AND PRIVACY. I AM SAYING THIS BECAUSE, MITO, YOU ARE MY FRIEND, SO IFEEL LIKE “LETTING IT OUT.”YET, WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT, CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THRUST UPON ME AND BEING AFIGHTER AT HEART I SORT OF FIGHT IT IN THE BEGINNING BUT SOON REALIZE WHAT INEED IS NOT INNER RESISTANCE AND NEEDLESS CONFLICT (IN THE FORM OF DISSIPATION);RATHER, BY JOINING FORCES TO READJUST AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.I COULDN’T GO WRONG BECAUSE WHAT I ALWAYS LIKE ABOUT MYSELF IS THIS STICKABILITYTOWARD QUALITY AND THE SINCERE DESIRE TO DO IT RIGHT. IN A WAY, I AM GLAD THATTHIS PROSPEROUS HAPPENING IS OCCURRING TO ME WHEN I AM MATURING TO A STATE OFREADINESS AND DEFINITELY WILL NOT BLOW IT BECAUSE OF“SELF-GLORIFICATION” OR[BEING] “BLINDED BY ILLUSIONS.” I AM PREPARED.BELIEVE ME, THIS MAN HERE IS CONFRONTING SOME “REAL” PRESSURE AND NEEDLESS TOSAY IT IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

ON JANUARY 29, 1971, BRUCE LEE LEFT LOS ANGELES FORINDIA TO SCOUT LOCATIONS FOR THE SILENT FLUTE, A FILM HE INTENDED TO MAKE.ACCOMPANYING HIM WERE HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTAR JAMES COBURN AND ACADEMY AWARD-WINNINGSCREENWRITER STIRLING SILLIPHANT, BOTH STUDENTS OF HIS. THEY ARRIVED IN NEWDELHI, INDIA, ON MONDAY FEBRUARY 1, 1971, AND SCOUTED LOCATIONS UNTIL THURSDAY,FEBRUARY 11, 1971. DURING THIS TEN-DAY PERIOD, WHILE DRIVING ACROSS THE INDIANDESERT, BRUCE FOUND TIME TO WRITE THE FOLLOWING LETTER.2 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d2]. THERE IS NO DATE ON THIS LETTER, BUT IN ALLPROBABILITY IT WAS WRITTEN IN MARCH OR APRIL 1971. (BLACK BELT MAGAZINEPUBLISHED THE ARTICLE MENTIONED IN THEIR SEPTEMBER 1971 EDITION.)3 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d3]. A BOOK BY FREDERICK PERLS, THE GESTALT-THERAPYPIONEER, SEVERAL OF WHOSE BOOKS BRUCE LEE HAD IN HIS LIBRARY.4 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d4]. LEO FONG SENT A FIVE-VOLUME COURSE-ON-DRAWING BOOKTO BRUCE.5 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d5]. BRUCE LEE’S IDEA, WHICH HE ENTITLED “THE WARRIOR,”EVENTUALLY BECAME THE “KUNG FU” TELEVISION SERIES. THE EXECUTIVES AT WARNERBROTHERS, HOWEVER, FELT THAT HE WAS “TOO ASIAN” TO CARRY THE LEAD ON AN“AMERICAN” (LEE WAS AN AMERICAN) SERIES AND SO GAVE THE LEAD ROLE TO CAUCASIANACTOR DAVID CARRADINE.6 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d6]. BETWEEN 1964 AND 1970, BRUCE LEE HURT HIS BACKSEVERAL TIMES. THE SEVEREST OF THESE INJURIES (OR, PERHAPS, REINJURIES) CAME ASA RESULT OF A WEIGHT-TRAINING ACCIDENT IN WHICH HE NEGLECTED TO WARM UPSUFFICIENTLY BEFORE PERFORMING A VERY STRENUOUS LOWER BACK EXERCISE. AS ARESULT, HE DAMAGED THE FOURTH SACRAL NERVE IN HIS LOWER BACK HIS DOCTORS TOLDHIM THAT HE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PERFORM MARTIAL ART AGAIN, BUT HE PERSEVERED,AND EVENTUALLY NOT ONLY RECOVERED HIS PREVIOUS LEVEL OF SKILL AND CONDITIONING,BUT ACTUALLY SURPASSED IT! NEVERTHELESS, HE WAS PLAGUED BY BACK PAIN FOR THEREMAINDER OF HIS LIFE.7 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d7]. LARRY HARTSELL WAS ONE OF BRUCE LEE’S STUDENTS ATHIS LOS ANGELES CHINATOWN SCHOOL. HARTSELL HAD SUFFERED A SEVERE HIP INJURYDURING AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT IN OCTOBER 1970. BRUCE LEE VISITED HIM IN THEHOSPITAL ON FIVE SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND THEN WROTE HIM THIS FOLLOW-UP LETTER OFSUPPORT. THE POEM ATTACHED MEANT A GREAT DEAL TO BRUCE DURING HIS OWN PERIOD OFREHABILITATION, AFTER A SEVERE BACK INJURY ALMOST ENDED HIS MARTIAL ART CAREER.HE HAD A TYPED COPY OF IT PERMAPLAQUED AND HUNG ON THE WALL OF HIS OFFICE, ANDHE WOULD REFER TO IT WHENEVER HE FACED GREAT PHYSICAL, ECONOMIC, OR CAREERHARDSHIPS.8 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d8]. AFTER MANY MONTHS OF SEVERE FINANCIAL ADVERSITY,BRUCE LEE RECEIVED A LONG-DISTANCE PHONE CALL FROM HONG KONG FILM PRODUCERRAYMOND CHOW. CHOW SAID THAT HE WAS STARTING A NEW FILM PRODUCTION COMPANYCALLED GOLDEN HARVEST FILMS, AND THAT HE WANTED TO SIGN BRUCE LEE TO ATWO-PICTURE DEAL. REALIZING THAT IF HE WERE GIVEN A VEHICLE TO EXPRESS HIMSELFCINEMATICALLY, HE WOULD BE WELL ON HIS WAY TO ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AS A MAJORTHEATRICAL TALENT AND A BANKABLE ACTOR, BRUCE LEE ACCEPTED WHAT, IN RETROSPECT,WAS CHOW’S MINUSCULE OFFER OF $15,000 FOR TWO FILMS.9 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d9]. THE FIRST OF BRUCE LEE’S TWO FILMS FOR GOLDENHARVEST FILMS WAS CALLED THE BIG BOSS.10 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d10]. THE “HIS AND HER SOMETHING” THAT BRUCE PICKED UPWAS A PAIR OF RINGS.11 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d11]. TED ASHLEY WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF WARNER BROTHERSFILMS, AND OCCASIONAL STUDENT OF BRUCE LEE’S.12 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d12]. TED ASHLEY’S WIFE, LINDA ASHLEY.13 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d13]. THIS IS BRUCE LEE’S REPLY TO SIU HON-SAN’S LETTERREQUESTING HIS PRESENCE AT A GATHERING OF MARTIAL ARTISTS IN SINGAPORE.UNFORTUNATELY; BRUCE LEE RECEIVED THE INVITATION TOO LATE TO ATTEND.14 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d14]. THE IDENTITY OF THE ADDRESSEE IS UNKNOWN. THERE ISNO DATE ON THE LETTER, BUT ITS REFERENCE TO A DUBBING SESSION PROBABLY REFERS TOTHE WAY OF THE DRAGON. LEE WAS VERY ACTIVE IN OVERSEEING ALL ASPECTS OF ITSPRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE DUBBING, WHICH WAS DONE DURING THE SUMMER OF 1972.15 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d15]. ONE OF BRUCE LEE’S OLDEST AND CLOSEST FRIENDS INHONG KONG WAS THE CHINESE ACTOR SIU KEE LUN—“UNICORN” TO HIS FRIENDS. LIKE BRUCELEE’S FATHER, UNICORN’S FATHER WAS AN ACTOR IN THE CANTONESE OPERA. UNICORNLATER APPEARED IN TWO OF BRUCE LEE’S FEATURE FILMS, FIST OF FURY AND THE WAY OFTHE DRAGON.16 [../Text/Part4.xhtml#d16].
