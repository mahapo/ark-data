He had the picturestaken for this purpose. The photos were taken in late 1967 after my father hadcoined the term “jeet kune do.” However, after the pictures were done, hechanged his mind about publishing a JKD book. Later in 1972 and 1973, my fatherbegan to work again on sequencing these same photos and writing captions forthem, so it is possible that he was reconsidering the project at that time.For his book, Bruce Lee wanted the action to be as realistic as possible, whichis why he sought out photographers who could help depict the action in realtime. For many of the shots, he used a high-speed camera to capture themovements. The photos taken at Bruce’s school were all shot in two days. Othershots were taken in front of Bruce’s house, in his backyard, and outside BlackBelt’s offices.To ensure the action was realistic, my father also insisted that the strikesmake real contact. He did not use full power when making contact because hedidn’t want to injure anyone, but he was adamant that the action look as real aspossible. Ted Wong recalls that when he had to take a kick from Bruce Lee, hewore a kendo chest protector, but Bruce was concerned that this would not beenough. So Ted tore up cardboard boxes and stuffed the pieces into his clothingto help protect his body from the impact. And even though Ted was black and blueat the end of the day, the shoot still remains a very fond memory of his.Without the help of Dan Inosanto, Ted Wong, Joe Bodner, Oliver Pang, MitoUyehara, Linda Lee, and, of course, Bruce Lee, this book on Bruce Lee’s fightingmethod would never have come into being. Many thanks to Black Belt, RainbowPublications, Ohara Publications and Active Interest Media for their help andcontinued support of Bruce Lee’s books and legacy. A special thank you to TedWong for his help in updating the books. We hope you enjoy this new and completeedition of Bruce Lee’s Fighting Method.—Shannon Lee2008"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThis book was in the making in 1966 and most of the photo­graphs were shot in1967. The late Bruce Lee intended to publish this book years ago but decidedagainst it when he learned that martial arts instructors were using his name topromote themselves. It was quite common to hear comments like “I taught BruceLee” or “Bruce Lee taught me jeet kune do.” And Bruce may never have seen orknown these martial artists.Bruce didn’t want people to use his name to promote themselves or their schoolswith false pretenses. He didn’t want them to attract students this way,especially the young teens.But after his death, his widow, Linda, felt that Bruce had contributed so muchin the world of the martial arts that it would be a great loss if the knowledgeof Bruce would die with him. Although the book can never replace the actualteaching and knowledge that Bruce Lee possessed, it will enhance you, theserious martial artist, in developing your skill in fighting.Bruce always believed that all martial artists train diligently for one singlepurpose—to defend themselves. Whether we are in judo, karate, aikido, kung fu,etc., our ultimate goal is to prepare ourselves for any situation.To train yourself for this goal, you must train seriously. Nothing is taken forgranted. “You have to kick or punch the bag with concentrated efforts,” Bruceused to say. “If you are going to train without the concept that this is thereal thing, you are shortchanging yourself. When you kick or punch the bag, youhave to imagine that you are actually hitting an adversary. Reallyconcentrating, putting 100 percent in your kicks and punches, is the only wayyou are going to be good.”If you have not read Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee, please read it. It wasmeant to complement this book, and the knowledge from both books will give you afull picture of Bruce’s art.—M.

EXERCISEAEROBIC EXERCISESOne of the most neglected elements of martial artists is the physical workout.Too much time is spent on developing skill in techniques and not enough inphysical participation.Practicing your skill in fighting is important, but so is maint-aining youroverall physical condition. Actually both are needed to be successful in a realfight. Training is a skill of disciplining your mind, developing your power andsupplying endurance to your body. Proper training is for the purpose of buildingyour body and avoiding activities or substances that will deteriorate or injureit.Bruce Lee was a specimen of health. He trained every day and consumed only theproper food. Although he drank tea, he never drank coffee—instead he normallyconsumed milk. He was a martinet who never let his work interfere with histraining. Even when he was sent to India to find suitable locations for filming,he took along his running shoes.Lee’s daily training consisted of aerobic exercises plus others, which werepatterned to develop his skill in fighting. He varied his exercises to avoidboredom. One of his favorite exercises was running four miles a day in 24 to 25minutes. He would change his tempo while running—after several miles ofconstant, even strides, he would sprint several feet and then return to easierrunning. Between changes in running tempo, he would also shuffle his feet. Leewas not particular where he ran: at the beach, in parks or woods, up and downhills or on surfaced streets, as in photo 1.Besides running, he also rode an Exercycle to develop his endurance, legs andcardiovascular muscles, as in photo 2. He usually rode at full speed—35 to 40miles per hour continuously for 45 minutes to an hour. Frequently, he would ridehis Exercycle right after his running.Another aerobic exercise that Lee scheduled in his routine was skipping rope,which you can adopt. This exercise not only develops your stamina and legmuscles but also improves your agility, making you “light on your feet.” Onlyrecently, physiologists have learned, by several tests, that skipping rope ismore beneficial than jogging. Ten minutes of skipping rope is equivalent to 30minutes of jogging. Both are very beneficial exercises for the cardio­vascularsystem.[images/9780897502504_002.jpg][images/9780897502504_003.jpg]Skipping rope properly is one of the best exercises for developing a sense ofbalance. First, skip on one foot, as in photo A, holding the other in front ofyou, then rotate your foot, as in photo B, skipping on the alternate foot witheach revolution of the rope, from a gradual pace to a really fast tempo.Minimize your arm-swing; instead, use your wrists to swing the rope over. Liftyour foot slightly above the ground, just enough for the rope to pass. Skip forthree minutes (equivalent to a round in a boxing match), then rest one minuteonly before you continue for another round. Three rounds of this exercise aresufficient for a good workout. As you become conditioned to skipping, you canomit the rest period and do the exercise for as long as 30 minutes straight. Thebest rope is made of leather with ball bearings in the handles.Additional endurance exercises are shadowboxing and actual sparring.Shadowboxing is a good agility exercise that also builds up your speed. Relaxyour body and learn to move easily and smoothly. At first, concentrate on yourform, as in photo C and move with lightness on your feet until it becomesnatural and comfortable—­then work faster and harder. It is a good idea to startyour work­out with shadowboxing to loosen your muscles. Imagine that your worstenemy stands before you and that you are going to demolish him. If you use yourimagination intensely, you can instill into yourself an almost real fightingframe of mind. Besides developing stamina, shadowboxing increases your speed,creates ideas and es­tablishes techniques to be used spontaneously andintuitively. Go­ing several rounds is the best way to learn proper footwork.Too many beginners are too lazy to drive themselves. Only by hard and continuousexercise will you develop endurance. You have to drive yourself to the point ofexhaustion (“out of breath”) and expect muscle ache in a day or two. The bestendurance training method seems to be a lengthy period of exercise interspersedwith many brief but high-intensity endeavors. Aerobic, stamina-type exercisesshould be done gradually and cautiously increased. Six weeks of this kind oftraining is a minimum for any sport that requires considerable amounts ofendurance. It takes years to be in peak condition and, un-fortunately, staminais quickly lost when you cease to maintain high conditioning exercises.According to some medical experts, you lose most of your benefit from exercisesif you skip more than a day between workouts.[images/9780897502504_004.jpg]WARMING-UP EXERCISESTo warm up, select light, easy exercises to loosen your muscles and prepare themfor more strenuous work. Besides improving your performance, warm-up exercisesare necessary to prevent injury to your muscles. No smart athlete will use hishands or legs violently without first warming them up carefully. These lightexercises should dictate as closely as possible the ensuing, more strenuoustypes of movements.How long should you warm up? This depends on several aspects. If you live in acolder area, or train during the cold winter, you have to do longer warm-upexercises than those who live in a warmer climate. Longer warm-ups arerecommended in the early morning than in the afternoon. Generally, five or tenminutes of warm-up exercises are adequate, but some performers need much more. Aballet dancer spends at least two hours warming up. He commences with very basicmovements, gradually but consistently increasing the activity and intensityuntil he is ready to make his appearance.FLEXIBILITY EXERCISESBruce Lee learned that certain exercises can help you greatly in yourperformance, and others can impede or even impair your execution of techniques.He found that beneficial exercises are those that do not cause antagonistictension in your muscles.Your muscles respond differently to different exercises. During a static or slowexercise such as a handstand or lifting heavy weights such as a barbell, themuscles on both sides of the joints operate strongly to set the body in adesirable position. But in a rapid activity such as running, jumping orthrowing, the muscles that close the joints contract and the muscles directlyopposite elongate to allow the movement. Although there is still tension on bothmuscles, the strain is considerably less on the elongated, or lengthened one.When there is excessive or antagonistic tension on the elongated muscles, ithinders and weakens your movement. It acts like a brake, causing prematurefatigue, generally associated only with a new activity that demands differentmuscles to perform. A coordi­nated, natural athlete is able to perform in anysporting activity with ease because he moves with little antagonistic tension.On the other hand, the novice performs with excessive tension and effort,creating a lot of wasted motions. Although this coordination trait is a morenatural talent in some than in others, all can improve it by intensive training.Here are some of the exercises that you can adapt to your daily training. Forflexibility, place your foot on a railing or object, as in photos A and B,keeping your leg horizontal to the ground—it could be slightly lower or higher,depending on your flexibility.[images/9780897502504_005.jpg]For the beginner, do not attempt any strenuous exercise. Instead, after placingyour foot on the railing, just move your toes toward you, keeping your extendedfoot flexed straight, as in photo A. After a few minutes, rotate your foot. In afew days, as your leg muscles are limbered, you can proceed to the next step, asin photo B. Press your knee to keep your leg straight and lean forward from thehip as much as possible without injuring your muscles. From this exercise, youthen proceed to emulate photo C. Keeping your extended leg straight, push yourhand downward. As you progress, you’ll notice that you are also beginning tolean forward, putting more stress on your leg muscles. Finally, you are able totouch your toes, as in photo D. After some months, you may be able to wrap yourhand around your foot, as in photo E, even with the support raised higher.[images/9780897502504_006.jpg]Other leg-flexibility exercises include leg splits and hanging leg raises, as inphoto F. To do this exercise, use a long rope supported by a pulley. A nooseencircles your foot. Pull the other end of the rope to the maximum height thatyour leg muscles will bear without hurting yourself. Try to keep your foothorizontally aligned throughout the exercise. This exercise allows you toexecute high side kicks. You should rotate your legs in all these exercises.[images/9780897502504_007.jpg][images/9780897502504_008.jpg]Advanced students who like to do exceptionally high kicks can progress totrampoline exercises. In photo G, Lee uses two light dumbbells and jumps high todevelop both balance and springy legs. Once he can control his body on atrampoline, he attempts leg splits, as in photo H; a high front kick, as inphoto I; and a flying side kick, as in photo J.[images/9780897502504_009.jpg]Other limbering exercises include body stretches. After you have developedelasticity in your leg muscles, you should be able to stretch your body as farback as possible, then bend forward as far as possible, until your head istouching your knees, as in photos K, L and M.ABDOMINAL EXERCISESNo one could help but notice Lee’s abdominal muscles. “One of the most importantphases of fighting,” he used to say, “is sparring. In order to spar, you must beable to take punches in your midsection.” To do this, Lee concentrated onseveral exercises that you can also adopt. The most popular are the sit-ups on aslant board, as in photo N (see page 18). Secure your feet, bend your knees and,after placing your hands behind your head, lift your body toward your feet. Doas many as you can until you feel the strain around your abdomen. After reaching50 to 100 repetitions, you can place a weight such as a dumbbell or barbellplate behind your neck and do your sit-ups.Another excellent way of doing sit-ups is to sit at the edge of a bench, havesomeone secure your ankles and lower your body as far down as possible towardthe floor. This exercise stretches your midsection much more, but it is moredifficult to do. If you have a chinning bar (pull-up bar), you can also developyour abdominal muscles by hanging onto the bar with both hands and slowlylifting both legs until they are extended horizontally. Keep them in thatposition for as long as possible and try to beat your last record each time youdo the exercise. Buy one of those kitchen timers to help you keep track of thetime.Another excellent exercise is the leg raise. Lie on the floor, keeping your backflat on it by pushing in your midsection and lifting your head slightly untilyou can see your feet. Keep your legs together and straight. Then lift themupward slowly and as high as possible. Then slowly return them to the floor.To get the most out of this exercise, do not let your feet touch the floor—keepthem about an inch above the floor and start to raise them again. Do as manyrepetitions as possible. If you have a weight-lifting bench, you can do the sameexercise, as in photo O. This exercise is also good for your lower back muscles.[images/9780897502504_010.jpg]One advantage in doing an abdominal exercise is that it can be done while youare doing other activities. For instance, Lee used to watch television whilelying on the floor with his head slightly up and keeping his feet spread out andslightly above the floor.To toughen your midsection, get a medicine ball and have someone drop it on yourabdomen, as in photos P and Q. To vary your exercise, you can also have someonethrow it directly to your midsection. Let the ball hit your body before catchingit. See photos R and S.[images/9780897502504_011.jpg]If you do your workout alone, you can use your heavy punching bag as asubstitute for the medicine ball. Swing the heavy bag and let it hit your body.You can adjust the spot of impact either by moving forward or backward. If youwant a heavier impact, swing the bag harder.In your daily life, there’s always an opportunity for more supplementalexercises. For instance, park your car several blocks from your destination andwalk briskly. Avoid the elevator and use the stairs instead. While climbing thestairs, you can have a good workout either by running up or by skipping a stepor two."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_012.jpg]CHAPTER 2THE ON-GUARD POSITION[images/9780897502504_013.jpg]STANCESThe most effective jeet kune do stance for attacking and defending is theon-guard position. This semi-crouch stance is perfect for fighting because yourbody is sturdy at all times and in a comfortably balanced position to attack,counter or defend without any forewarning movements. It provides your body withcomplete ease and relaxation but, at the same time, allows quick reaction time.From this stance, the movement is not jerky but smooth and prepares your nextmove without any restriction. It creates an illusion or “poker body” to youropponent—concealing your intended movements.The on-guard position is perfect for mobility. It allows you to take small stepsfor speed and controlled balance while bridging the distance to your opponent,and it camouflages your timing. Because the leading hand and foot are closest tothe target, 80 percent of the hitting is done by them. Bruce Lee, a naturalright-hander, adopted the “southpaw” or “unorthodox” stance because he believedthat the stronger hand and foot should do most of the work.[images/9780897502504_014.jpg]It is important to position your arms, feet and head correctly. From thesouthpaw stance, the chin and shoulder should meet halfway—the right shoulderraised an inch or two and the chin dropped about the same distance. At thisposition, the muscles and bone structure are in the best possible alignment,protecting the point of the chin. In close-in fighting, the head is heldvertically with the edge of the chin pressed to the collarbone and one side ofthe chin tucked to the lead shoulder. Only in rare, extreme defensive maneuverswould the point of the chin be tucked into the lead shoulder. This would angleyour head and turn your neck into an unnatural position. Fighting in thisposition would tense the lead shoulder and arm, prevent free action and causefatigue because you would lack support of the muscles and straight bonealignment.The leading hand position could be placed slightly below shoulder height, as inphotos A and A1 (close-up shot). In photos B and B1, pay close attention to theextension of both Lee’s right and left hand. Photos C and C1 reveal another viewof his stance from the back, showing his leading hand more clearly.In photo Y, both fighters stand in the on-guard position incorrectly. The personon the left has his right foot too wide and reveals too much of his body. Theperson on the right has his right foot too far to his left, restricting hismovement and keeping him off-balance.[images/9780897502504_015.jpg]Sometimes, but very seldom, you can adopt the low-line position without a leadbecause many fighters are not prepared for such a defense. This type of positionmay confuse your opponent and severely hamper and, to a certain extent, checkhis offensive assault. Your exposed head is now a target but can be protected bymobility and relying on being a safe distance away from him.The rear hand is held four to five inches from your body in the on-guardposition with the elbow protecting the lower ribs and the forearm gentlybrushing your body, defending the midsection. The rear hand is aligned with thelead shoulder and placed almost to the chest of that shoulder.[images/9780897502504_016.jpg]The lead foot dictates the position of the trunk. If the lead foot is properlyin place, then the trunk automatically assumes the correct position. It isimportant that the trunk form a straight line with the lead leg. As the leadfoot is turned inward, the body consequently moves in the same direction,displaying a narrow target to the opponent. If, however, the lead foot is turnedoutward, the body is squared, presenting a larger target. For defense, thenarrow target obviously is more advantageous, but the square blends in betterfor launching some attacks.[images/9780897502504_017.jpg]Good form is essential to your stance. It allows you to perform in the mostefficient manner with a minimum of lost movement and wasted energy. Eliminatethe nonessential motions and muscle activity, which causes exhaustion withoutgaining any benefit. Both of your arms and shoulders must be relaxed and loose,to whip out and snap your fists like thrusts from a rapier. Keep your lead handor both hands in constant “weaving” motion, but always keep yourself coveredwhile doing it. The lead hand should be constantly moving, flickering in and outlike a snake’s tongue ready to strike. This threatening motion keeps youropponent in a bewildering plight.Remember, if you tense up, you lose your balance, timing and flexibility, whichare essential to all proficient fighters. Although relaxation is a physicalform, it is controlled by your mind. You have to learn, by conscious effort, todirect your thoughts and body into this new habit of muscular activity.Relaxation is a state of muscular tension. It is natural to have a slight degreeof tension in your muscles when performing any physical activity. But yourantagonistic muscles must retain a low degree of tension to perform coordinated,graceful and efficient movements. Through constant practice, you can achievethis feeling of relaxation at will. Once you have acquired this, you shouldinduce this attitude in a potentially tension-created environment.[images/9780897502504_018.jpg]Use a mirror to constantly check your posture, hand position and movement. Lookat your stance and see if you are standing almost like a cat, with your backslightly hunched, chin lowered and your lead shoulder slightly up and preparedto spring. Contract your abdominal muscles partially. Protect your sides withyour elbows and leave no openings at which your opponent may hit. The on-guardposition is considered the safest stance. In jeet kune do, it is the mostfavorable position for kicking, hitting and applying bodily force.Here are some faults on the following stances, as in photos A to O (see pages26-31):A: His right leg is too far out and will hinder his movement, especially withthe weight on his rear foot. With both hands on his hips, he leaves himself wideopen for an upper-body and head attack.B: His stance is too square, and he can easily be thrown off-balance. He is alsorestricted from deep penetration in his countering.C: His elongated stance with a long lead and an extended foot places him in avulnerable position. The lead side of the body is open to attack, the extendedhand is immobilized and withdrawing the hand telegraphs his intention.[images/9780897502504_019.jpg]D: Both his hands are too extended. His rear arm is held too high and leaves hisbody wide open. His front hand is too extended to deliver an attack.E: Standing too much to the side prevents him from deep penetration whileattacking or retreating. He can easily be thrown off-balance.F: Both arms are carried too low, exposing his upper body and head.G: His body is too rigid. The lead hand is too extended for attacking, and therear hand is too low for protecting blows to the head.H: His stance is too wide for any kind of mobility. It is difficult to attackwithout telegraphing from this position, and the groin area is exposed for afront kick.I: His right arm is carried too high and leaves the rib-cage area exposed. Hishand is too extended to deliver an attack.[images/9780897502504_020.jpg][images/9780897502504_021.jpg]J: The cat stance restricts movements, especially when side-stepping toward hisright if he is in the right lead position. Secondly, any blow delivered fromthis position would not have power because his weight is fully on the rear foot.K: His stance is too narrow. It eliminates the springiness of his footwork. Theknees should be slightly bent for explosive and springy movement.L: Like the cat stance, too much weight is placed on his back foot, and thisrestricts his forward mobility, especially with a wide stance. To launch apunch, he has to shift his weight to the front foot and telegraph his intention.M: Too much weight on the lead foot could throw him off-balance by a sweep. Atoo-extended stance is also vulnerable for a kick to the knee and shin.N: With both hands on the hips, his body and head are completely exposed for anassault. The groin area is unnecessarily open because of the awkward placementof his rear foot.O: This stance makes the body, the face, and the knee and shin of the lead legvulnerable. Kneeling on the floor just about eliminates any mobility for attackor defense.[images/9780897502504_022.jpg][images/9780897502504_023.jpg]BALANCEBalance is the most important aspect of the on-guard stance. Without properbalance at all times, you will lose body control in the middle of an action.Balance is only attained with correct body alignment. Your feet should bedirectly under your body, spread apart at a comfortable medium distance (thespace of a natural step) so you are braced and not standing on just one point.The weight of your body can be evenly balanced on both feet or slightly on yourlead foot. By bending the forward knee, the center of gravity leans slightlyforward, but the lead heel should have only light ground contact to retainbalance and reduce tension (“light on your feet”). The lead leg should also befairly straight with the knee, not locked but relaxed and loose. Although theabove rule is generally true, there is no hard and fast rule that your heelsshould constantly be raised or flat. This depends on the situation and positionof your body.[images/9780897502504_024.jpg]The rear heel is raised to facilitate shifting your weight quickly to the leadleg when delivering a punch. It also acts as a spring to your body. It gives inwhen taking a blow. Like the lead knee, it should be slightly bent but relaxedand flexible when performing. A good fighter is rarely detected with his kneestraight, even when he has to move suddenly.The on-guard position presents a perfect body balance that should be constantlymaintained. The lead side of the body creates a direct, imaginary line from thefront heel to the tip of the front shoulder, as in photos 1 (front view) and 1A(bird’s-eye view). In photo 2, the side view of Lee’s position reveals thenatural distance between the feet, both knees slightly bent, and the rear heelraised a bit more than the front.[images/9780897502504_025.jpg]This stance allows you several advantages: speed, relaxation, balance and smoothmovement, plus it permits you to unleash a powerful blow.Good balance is controlling your body in any position by con­trolling yourcenter of gravity. Even if your body is slanted or is placed in an unstableequilibrium—away from the base of support—you should be able to pursue andrecover your equilibri­um.In photo A, Lee retreats from his opponent, maintaining good balance, and inphoto B, he throws a long punch but still controls his body for any counteringattack.To control the center of gravity in motion, take a short step and glide insteadof a hop or cross-step. To move rapidly, take several small steps. Take twomedium steps instead of one long stride to cover the same distance. Your centerof gravity constantly changes according to your own actions and those of youropponent. For instance, to advance swiftly, the center of gravity should subtlybe transferred to the lead or front foot, unrestraining the back foot to propelyour body forward in a quick, short and sudden burst. To retreat or move backquickly, the center of gravity should be transferred to the back foot, allowingyou to be in balance for a parry or a counterattack.Wide strides or constant switching of weight from one foot to the other in yourmovement should be eliminated, except in hitting and kicking. That momentbetween shifting results in poor balance, places you in a position vulnerable toan attack and prevents you from launching a strong attack. Additionally, itallows the opponent to time his attack at the moment of shifting.You should strive for good balance in motion and not only in stillness. You mustattempt to control your body with perfect balance, especially while deliveringeffective punches and kicks, because you must shift your weight constantly fromone foot to the other. Retaining your balance while constantly changing yourbody weight is an art few people ever master.It is all right to switch your strategy while fighting or sparring, but don’tstray far from your basic form. In photo 1, the figure is in a fairly goodposition but with slightly too much weight on his front foot. But as soon as heattempts to launch an attack, as in photo 2 (see page 35), he throws himself outof balance. Good form requires good balance. Proper balance and perfect timingcontribute to good leverage, which is necessary to kick or punch with sustainedpower.[images/9780897502504_026.jpg][images/9780897502504_027.jpg]The most ideal position of your feet is one that permits you to maneuverinstantly in all directions and serves as a pivotal point for your entireattack. It keeps you in good balance to withstand blows from all sides and, atthe same time, furnishes you with the ability to unleash unforeseen power inyour blows. As in baseball, the drive and power in swinging a bat are alsoderived from your legs.The on-guard position presents you with balance and ease of movement throughproper body alignment. A too-wide stance, as in photo A, deviates from correctalignment. It provides sturdiness and power but forfeits speed and efficientmovement. A short stance, as in photo B, presents speed but loses power andproper balance.Do not overcommit in throwing a punch or a kick—it affects your balance.Practice countering against a stand-up opponent. When he misses with a blow, heloses balance for an instant and is vulnerable to a counter. The only recoursehe has, to be fairly safe, is to keep his knees slightly bent.[images/9780897502504_028.jpg]Learn kinesthetic perception, which is the faculty to feel muscle contractionand relaxation. The only way to develop this kinesthetic perception at first isto place your body and its parts in different positions and be highly sensitiveabout them. For example, place yourself in a balanced position and then animbal­anced one, feeling the contrast as you move forward, backward and to bothsides. Once you have attained this feeling, use it as a constant guide to yourbody as it moves from gracefulness to awkwardness and from relaxation totension. Finally, your kinesthetic percep­tion should be so keen that you areuncomfortable unless your body functions with minimal effort to achieve maximumresults.To develop correct balance, practice from both the right and left stances,especially when performing the same tactics or exercises. Between trainingsessions, stand on one foot while putting on your clothes or shoes.[images/9780897502504_029.jpg]Practicing “chi sao” (sticky-hands exercise) is one of the best ways to developbalance. In the wing chun method, both practitioners keep their feet parallel toeach other, as in photos 1 and 2. Both of their hands are extended until onlytheir wrists touch each other. Each one, keeping one hand inside and the otheroutside of his opponent’s hands, rotates his arms back and forth in acounterclockwise motion. Pressure should be applied to the arms in order to rockthe partner from his position. To prevent this, each should keep his kneesslightly bent and keep the center of gravity downward by lowering his hips. Inthis position, you have good balance from side to side but not back and forth.Eventually, Lee converted the stance by placing one foot forward, as in photos 3and 4. In this position, one has better all-around balance and better structurefor applying energy. This modification is not quite the jeet kune do on-guardposition, but it resembles it more closely. For more discussion on chi sao, goto page 70.[images/9780897502504_030.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_031.jpg]CHAPTER 3FOOTWORKIn jeet kune do, mobility is heavily emphasized because hand-to-hand combat is amatter of movements. Your application of an effective technique depends on yourfootwork. Speed of your footwork leads the way for fast kicks and punches. Ifyou are slow on your feet, you will be slow with your hands and feet, too.The principle of fighting is the art of mobility: to seek your target or toavoid being a target. Footwork in jeet kune do should be easy, relaxed and alivebut firm in movement, while the traditional, classical horse stance seekssolidity in stillness. This unnecessary, strenuous stance is not functionalbecause it is slow and awkward. In fighting, you are required to move in anydirection instantly.Proper footwork is good balance in action, which contributes to hitting powerand avoidance of punishment. Good footwork will beat any kick or punch. A movingtarget is definitely more difficult to hit than a stationary one. The moreskillful you are with your footwork, the less you have to use your arms to blockor parry kicks and punches. By moving deftly, you can elude almost any blow and,at the same time, prepare your fists and feet to attack.Besides evading blows, footwork allows you to cover distance rapidly, escape outof a tight corner and conserve your energy to counter with more sting in yourpunch or kick. A heavy slugger with poor footwork will exhaust himself as hefutilely attempts to hit his opponent.Properly positioning your feet allows you to move rapidly in any direction andwithstand blows from any angle. The feet must always be directly under yourbody. The on-guard stance presents proper body balance and a natural alignmentof your feet.THE SHUFFLETo advance, do not cross or hop but shuffle your feet. At the outset, you willfeel clumsy and slow, but as you keep practicing this movement daily, you willdevelop your speed and grace. To do the forward shuffle, as in photos 1, 2 and 3(front view), A, B and C (side view) and X, Y and Z (back view), stand in theon-guard position. To move forward cautiously, slide your front foot forward, asin photos 2, B, Y (see page 43), about a half step, widening the space betweenyour feet just for a second as you slide your rear foot forward. When the rearfoot is moved forward, you should be at the original position. Then, to advancefarther forward, repeat the process.[images/9780897502504_032.jpg][images/9780897502504_033.jpg][images/9780897502504_034.jpg]Notice in the photos that Bruce Lee retains complete balance constantly andkeeps his guard up. You should not be flat-footed in motion but should glide onthe balls of your feet with sensitivity and feeling. Learn to move like atightrope walker whose feet carry him safely across a high-altitude rope evenwhen blindfolded.Keep your knees slightly bent and relaxed. The front foot is flat but notheavily planted on the floor. It should be light and raised intuitively—aboutone-eighth of an inch on a quick movement or sudden shift of the body.The rear heel is almost always raised, in stillness or in motion. It is raisedslightly higher than the front foot—about one-quarter or one-half of an inch.The raised rear heel facilitates switching your weight immediately to the otherfoot when delivering a punch. The raised back heel allows fast reaction of thatfoot and also acts as a spring, giving in to blows from any angle. Naturally,the heel should drop at the impact of the blow. There is no hard and fast rulethat your heels should be constantly raised or that they should be flat. Thisdepends on several factors, such as your body position, your reaction to attackor to defend with your hands or feet, etc.In the advance shuffle, you should be light on your feet and your weight shouldbe evenly distributed, except for just a split second when you are advancingyour front foot, as in photos 2, B, Y (see page 43). At that instant, yourweight would shift just a little to that foot.In retreating or moving backward cautiously (see opposite page), you justreverse your movement. The basis behind the retreat shuffle, as in photos 1, 2and 3 (front view), A, B and C (side view) and X, Y and Z (back view), is likethe advance shuffle. From the on-guard position, slide or shuffle your rear footbackward about a half step, as in photos 2, B and Y, widening the space betweenyour feet just for a split second as you slide your front foot backward. Whenthe front foot is in place, you should be in the on-guard position andper­fectly balanced. Unlike the advance shuffle, your weight shifts slightly forjust an instant to your rear foot, or the stationary foot, when you slide yourfront foot backward. To retreat farther, continue to repeat the process. Learnto be light on your feet continuously and keep your rear heel raised.[images/9780897502504_035.jpg][images/9780897502504_036.jpg][images/9780897502504_037.jpg]The forward and backward shuffle must be made with a series of short steps toretain complete balance. This position prepares you to shift your body quicklyto any direction, and it is a perfect position for attacking or defending.[images/9780897502504_038.jpg]QUICK MOVEMENTSThe quick advance, as in photos 1 to 4, is almost like the forward shuffle. Fromthe JKD on-guard position with your front foot, as in photo 1, step forwardabout three inches, as in photo 2. This seem­ingly insignificant movement keepsyour body aligned and helps you to move forward in balance. It allows you tomove with both feet evenly supplying the power. Without this short step, therear foot does most of the work.As soon as you glide your front foot, quickly slide your back foot almost toreplace your front foot’s position, as in photo 3. Unless you move your frontfoot instantly, the rear foot cannot be planted properly because the front footwill be partially in its way. So just before your rear foot makes contact withyour front, slide your front foot forward. At this position, if you have nottaken another step, you should be back at the on-guard position with your feetapart at a natural distance, as in photo 4. But the purpose of this movement isto move your body quickly to a distance, eight feet or more, that requiresseveral steps. Except for the first three-inch step, the series of steps shouldbe made at a normal walking space. This movement keeps your body in perfectalignment and allows you to move rapidly ahead.[images/9780897502504_039.jpg]In photo 3, it seems like Lee is in an awkward position, but he is in thatposition for just a split second. If you were actually watching him physically,you would have witnessed only a flowing, graceful movement and never would havedetected any awkwardness.QUICK RETREATThe footwork for the quick retreat or rapid backward move­ment is similar to thequick advance, except you move in the opposite direction. From the on-guardposition, move your front foot back, as in photos A and B (see pages 48 and 49).The front foot, like the quick advance, initiates the movement with the rearfoot following just a split second later. Unless you move your rear foot beforethe front foot makes contact, the front foot cannot be planted properly. Unlikethe quick advance, you do not have to slide your foot three inches. It is justone quick motion, but your body should be in alignment and in balance. If youwere to move just once, you should be at the on-guard position when both of yourfeet are in place. But the purpose of this movement is to move your body fourfeet or more.[images/9780897502504_040.jpg]The quick movement and shuffle can only be accomplished by being light on yourfeet. The best exercise for overcoming the force of inertia on your feet isskipping rope and shadowboxing several minutes. While exercising, you mustconstantly be con­scious of keeping your feet “light as a feather.” Eventually,you will be stepping around with natural lightness.You must move without any strain, gliding on the balls of your feet, bendingyour knees slightly, and keeping your rear heel raised. Have feeling orsensitivity in your footwork. Quick or relaxed footwork is a matter of properbalance. In your training, as you return to an on-guard position, as in photo C,after each phase of maneuvers, shuffle on the balls of your feet with ease andfeeling before continuing to your next maneuver. This drill enhances your skillas it simulates actual fighting.Unless there is a strategic purpose, forward and backward movements should bemade with short and quick slides. Lengthy steps or foot actions, which causeyour weight to shift from one foot to the other, should be eliminated except indelivering a blow because, at that moment, your body is imbalanced—restrictingyour attack or defense effectively. Crossing your feet in motion is a bad habitbecause it tends to unbalance you and exposes your groin area.The movement should not be a series of hops, nor should it be jerky. Both feetshould slither rhythmically just above the surface of the floor like a gracefulballroom dancer. Visually, your movement should not be like the kangaroo hoppingacross the open plain but like the stallion galloping with even, rhythmic andgraceful strokes of his feet.[images/9780897502504_041.jpg]THE BURSTThe forward burst or lunge is the quickest JKD movement. It is also one of thehardest to learn because it depends on good coordination and because yourbalance can be thrown off very easily. It is utilized to penetrate deeply toattack with a side kick or to counter an attack such as a kick.The forward burst is one deep lunge. From an on-guard position, as in photo 1,step forward about three inches with your front foot, like the quick advancemovement, to align your body and be in bal­ance, as in photo 2. Then, for fasterreaction, use your lead hand as an impetus. By sweeping your lead hand upward, amomentum is created, like someone is jerking you forward suddenly as you areholding on to a rope, as in drawings A and B. This sweep of your hand alsodistracts your opponent and throws his timing off.[images/9780897502504_042.jpg][images/9780897502504_043.jpg]While sweeping your hand upward, your hips swing forward simultaneously,dragging your rear foot forward. In that split instant, your weight is heavilyon your front foot, only at this moment your leg straightens out to thrust yourbody forward. Sometimes, on an especially deep, penetrating leap, your rear footmay be ahead of your front foot while you are gliding in the air, as in photo X.You must land on your left foot only as your right foot is delivering a sidekick, as in photo Y. As soon as you have completed your kick, you should quicklyplace your right foot down and assume the on-guard position. That one leapshould carry your body at least two wide steps.In a recently conducted test, by using the forward burst, it took onlythree-quarters of a second to travel eight feet. By applying the classical lungemovement or stepping by crossing your feet, it took one-and-one-half seconds toreach the same distance—twice the time.The leap should be more horizontal than vertical. It is more like a broad jumpthan a high jump. You should try for distance by keeping your feet close to thefloor. Your knees should always be bent slightly so that the powerful thighmuscles’ springy explosiveness is utilized.[images/9780897502504_044.jpg]When practicing this footwork in the beginning, don’t worry about your hands.Just keep them in the regular JKD position and concentrate on your footwork.Once you are accustomed to the feet movement with proper balance, learn to sweepyour hand forward just before each leap.Later, to develop speed and naturalness in your movement, adopt the followingexercise in your daily training. From an on-guard position, do the forward burstwithout penetrating too deeply by sweeping your hand upward, leaping forwardwithout straining yourself and quickly placing your front foot down withoutkicking. Continue to do this motion over and over again without stopping, butkeep your balance and fluidity in motion. This exercise is excellent to adaptyour body to move with ease, rhythm and grace. As you become more adapted to themovement, increase your speed and work toward shortening the distance betweenyou and your opponent by more and more execution. Eventually, you can substitutea backfist punch for the sweeping movement of your hand.[images/9780897502504_045.jpg]The backward burst is like the quick backward movement except that it carriesyour body backward more quickly and deeply. From an on-guard position, push theball of your front foot to initiate the motion, which straightens your frontknee and shifts the weight to the rear foot. Then the front foot, withoutpausing from the initial motion, leaves the floor and crosses your rear foot.Just before it lands, your rear leg, with its knee bent and acting like aspring, should thrust your body with a sudden straightening of its leg. Youshould land on the ball of your front foot just a second before your rear foottouches the floor. That one quick motion should carry your body backward atleast two natural walking steps.The backward burst carries your body just as fast as the forward lunge. In thesame test (see page 50), it took exactly the same time to travel eight feetbackward as forward—three-quarters of a second. By comparison, the classicalmovement covered the same distance in one second flat.For your daily training, do the backward burst for speed, balance and rhythminstead of deep penetration. Move with lightness of your feet and keeppracticing toward shortening the distance. You can also do isometric exercisesto build up your calves to help with your burst for speed, as in photo 1.While jogging, do a quick advance by rapidly shuffling your feet and thenreturning to your jogging. Another exercise is to practice with a partner. Letyour partner do the backward burst while you do the forward burst. From anon-guard position, attempt to reach your partner with a light side kick as hetries to keep his distance. Then, reverse your positions.Learn not to hurl yourself recklessly at your partner but attempt to narrow thegap of space in a calm and exact manner. Keep drilling faster and faster bylunging two to three hundred times per day. Acceleration can be increased onlyby discipline in your workout.SIDE STEPPINGSide stepping is the technique of moving your body toward the right or leftwithout losing your balance. It is a safe and essential defensive maneuver toattack or produce openings for a counter when the opponent least expects it. Itis used to avoid straight­forward assaults, blows or kicks. You can alsofrustrate your opponent by simply moving when he is about to attack.To sidestep to the right from an unorthodox (southpaw) on­-guard position, moveyour right foot slightly forward and sharply toward the right about 18 inches,as in photos 1 and 2. Your left or rear foot supplies the impetus as you landlightly on the ball of your right foot. For a split instant, your shoulder swaystoward your right, and your weight shifts on the front foot with its knee bent.Your shoulder automatically realigns when you quickly slide your left foot inthe exact same manner and resume the on-guard position, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_046.jpg]To sidestep to the left from a southpaw stance, as in photo A, move your leftfoot slightly forward and to your left about 18 inches, as in photo B. Duringthis motion, your body is more aligned than when moving toward the right.Because your body is more aligned, you are in better balance and your weight isevenly distributed between your two feet during the shift. Your right or frontfoot should follow immediately in the exact same manner, return­ing you to theon-guard stance, as in photo C. You will notice that sidestepping toward yourleft is more natural and easier than to the right.Bruce Lee uses a staff to practice his footwork. In photo A (see page 56), heplaces the staff near his neck and slightly above his shoulder. The partnerattempts to thrust the long staff at that exact area, and Lee adjusts to thethrust by using footwork.[images/9780897502504_047.jpg][images/9780897502504_048.jpg]In photos B and C (front view), the partner thrusts his staff and Lee sidestepstoward his left, keeping his body in balance and his eyes continuously on hispartner. He has to move sharply to avoid the edge of the staff.In close fighting or infighting, a fairly safe stance is the drop shift or theforward drop, as in photo D. This is done by shifting your body forward andslightly to your left, with your head in close and both hands carried high. Itis used to gain the outside or inside guard position, which enables you tostrike the opponent’s groin, throw an uppercut, stomp his instep or grapple himdown. In the forward shift, you can move directly to the left, right or back,using the same step. This depends on your strategy and the degree of safetyrequired in that instant.Against an orthodox fighter, you would sidestep to your right or away from hisrear hand. Against a southpaw, you move the opposite way, meaning mostly to yourleft. The art of side stepping is not to move early but late and quickly, justbefore you are hit.[images/9780897502504_049.jpg]In nearly all motions, your first step is with the foot moving to thatparticular direction in which you intend to go. In other words, if you sidestepto your right, your right foot moves first toward that direction. If yousidestep to your left, your left foot moves first.To move quickly, your body should lean toward the direction you are going justbefore you step out.In jeet kune do, the aim of footwork is simplification, economy and speed with aminimum of motion. Move just enough to avoid the opponent’s attack or blow, andlet him commit himself fully. Do not tire yourself by dancing on your toes likea fancy boxer.While practicing, stand naturally—with ease and comfort—so your muscles canperform at their peak. Learn to differentiate between personal comfort anddrilling comfort. You should never be set or tense but flexible and prepared."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_050.jpg]CHAPTER 4POWER TRAININGPower in hitting is not based strictly on strength. How many times have you seena boxer who is not muscular but packs a wallop in his punch? And then you seeanother heavily muscular boxer who can’t knock anyone down. The reason behindthis is that power isn’t generated by your contractile muscles but from theimpetus and speed of your arm or foot. Bruce Lee, a 130-pounder, was able to hitharder than a man twice his size because Lee’s blow, with a heavy force behindit, was much faster.In jeet kune do, you do not hit by just swinging your arm. Your whole bodyshould participate in the impetus—your hips, shoul­ders, feet and arms. Theinertia of your punch should be a straight line in front of your nose—using itas the guiding point—as in photo 1. The punch originates not from the shoulderbut from the center of your body.In photo 2, the fist lands too far to his left, exposing his right side for acounterattack and not allowing much time to recover for a defense. In photo 3,the punch comes from his shoulder with not much power behind it. He is too rigidto take advantage of his hip and body motion.[images/9780897502504_051.jpg][images/9780897502504_052.jpg]PUNCHING POWERStraight punching or kicking is the basis for scientific and artistic fighting.It is a modern concept in fisticuffs derived from the knowledge of body leverageand makeup. A punch from your arm alone doesn’t supply enough power. Your armsshould be used strictly as bearers of your force, and the correct application ofyour body should furnish the power. In any power punching, the body must bebalanced and aligned with your lead foot, forming a straight line. This sectionof your body is the mainstay, functioning as an axis to generate power.Before you can punch with power, you must first learn to clench your fistsproperly—otherwise, you are liable to injure them. From an outspread position ofyour fingers and thumb, as in photo A, roll your fingertips into your palm, asin photos B and C. Then overlap your thumb tightly over your clenched fingers.The tip of the thumb extends to the center of your middle finger, as in photo D.There are several training exercises that you can utilize to learn powerpunching. One of the best ways is to learn to use your hips. To do this, tie astring to a piece of paper, about 8 by 11 inches, and hang it from the ceilingto your chest height.Using this thin paper as your target, stand about seven to ten inches away withboth your feet parallel to it. Keeping both loosely clenched fists in front ofyour chest, elbows hanging freely at your sides, twist your body clockwise asfar as it will go on the balls of your feet. Both knees must bend slightly foryour body to twist fully. Now, your body should be facing to your right, 90degrees from the target, with the weight shifting to your left foot. But youreyes must constantly be fixed on the target.Pivot on the balls of your feet, with your hips initiating a sudden, rotatingmotion. Your weight quickly shifts to your other foot as your shouldersautomatically rotate after your hips. Simultaneously, as your body is rotating,raise your right elbow to your shoulder height just in time to apply an elbowstrike to the proper target. The momentum should turn your body 180 degrees soit faces the opposite or left side. It is very important that your hips rotateslightly ahead of your shoulders to obtain maximum power.Repeat the same motion from the left side, striking with your left elbow. Onceyou have learned to control your body and begin to feel at ease in thisexercise, you may use your fists.Step back about 20 to 25 inches from the target. Keeping your exact bodyposition, swing at the target with a straight punch. At this point, your bodyshould be aligned properly, you should have good balance and your motion shouldbe fluid, with your hips initiating the rotation. Your power in the punchesshould increase between 80 percent to 100 percent.Gradually, to keep your body in balance, especially after the completion of theswing, place your left foot forward and your right foot back (orthodox stance).From this position, twist your body clockwise until your shoulders are in astraight line with the target. Your front foot should be about 15 inches away.Now your weight leans heavily on your rear foot with both knees slightly bent.As the hips initiate the movement, you pivot on the balls of both feet, and yourbody is driven forward by the impetus from the rear foot. Your rear heel risesas your weight quickly shifts to the front foot with the delivery of the punch.At the completion of the action, your rear knee is practically straightened andyour rear heel is almost completely raised. Your body should be facing thetarget. This motion is similar to a baseball player swinging a bat with all hismight.Once you have grasped this way of hitting, you can begin to work on your powerblows by hitting the heavy punching bag, as in photo A. Here, Lee uses his elbowstrike to develop his hip motion, then later works on his punches, as in photoB.[images/9780897502504_053.jpg]Your final step in punching for power is to reverse your footing and positionyourself in the on-guard stance, with your right foot in front. With both ofyour knees slightly bent and rear heel raised, shift your weight just slightlyto the rear foot for an instant. Your weight should be set for less than asecond because you have to rotate your hips counterclockwise and because yourweight switches to the front foot just before you throw a punch. This leadingstraight punch doesn’t have as much power as the others, which have access to afreer and fuller rotation of the hips. But if you can master this punch with theright rotational hip timing, you have a punch that’s much more effective than ajab and very instrumental in the success of your sparring and fighting. It willbe your most usable and dependable weapon. Like with the other punchingtechniques, from the paper target you can substitute more solid targets todevelop your power.[images/9780897502504_054.jpg]Lee used to concentrate heavily on the straight lead punch in his daily trainingschedule, using different apparatus. In photos 1 and 2, he uses a punching pad.Sometimes he drew his right hand back to throw a much heavier blow, as in photos3 and 4 to simulate close fighting.Another apparatus used in his training was the light shield, as in photos X andY. Lee liked to use various hitting equipment. He used to say, “I don’t know thetrue feeling of hitting a person. First of all, each part of the human body hasa different composition. You may hit a hard, bony substance or a soft, fattyarea. And second, hitting with gloves on is different from bare knuckles.Unfortunately, using bare knuckles on your partner is not too practical.”[images/9780897502504_055.jpg]The shield presents a different feeling when there is contact. The shield ismore solid than the pad, and because the holder stands more firmly with bothhands on the equipment, it will not give in like the pad will. For a morepunishing punch, Lee selects the canvas bag, as in photo 1. He usually had threebags hanging on the wall. One was filled with sand, another with gravel or beansand the third with steel sawdust found in any machine shop. In the beginning, itis wise that you wear light boxing gloves on the heavy canvas bag as well asthese wall bags. You must first toughen your knuckles before going bare-fisted.[images/9780897502504_056.jpg]In jeet kune do, your punches are not thrown like the classical stylist’s.Instead of using the first two knuckles (the index and the middle fingers), usethe last three knuckles, as in photo 2. The punches are not thrown from the hipsin jeet kune do like the person on the left is doing in photos A and B, butrather they are thrown from the chest, as Lee is about to do in photo A. Thedelivery should be straight and not with a twist of your hand. If you twist yourhand, the knuckles will align horizontally at impact, but if you deliverstraight out, it will hit the target either vertically or obliquely, as in photoB. Consequently, you should toughen the last three knuckles, as in photo 2.Besides punching the wall canvas bags for toughening, you can also train with asand or gravel box, as in photo C. Other exercises include push-ups with yourclenched fists. Place the knuckles of your index fingers and the two smallfingers on a hard floor so your palms face each other. This is an excellentexercise for beginners because they can gradually toughen their knuckles withoutrisk of injury.[images/9780897502504_057.jpg]By being in the southpaw or JKD on-guard position, it is apparent that the rightor lead hand will lose considerable punching power to a right-hander. Unless hecan draw his right hand farther back, he lacks the space needed to deliver themost devastating blow. Power is now being replaced by speed in this case. Tocompensate, the left or rear hand must do the job.If you are a natural right-hander, punching with the left seems very awkward inthe beginning. You’ll be off-balance, and your punch from that hand will beweak, slow and not too accurate. But by constantly practicing with your rightfoot as the lead, as in photo A, and doing the motion exactly, you shoulddevelop your punching power in that hand.[images/9780897502504_058.jpg]Eventually, your rear straight punch and cross will be the most powerful punchesavailable in your arsenal. You will be depending on them for your knockoutblows. Keep practicing with your left hand until it becomes natural.One of the most helpful but simple implements that Bruce Lee incorporated intohis training schedule was the round steel cylinder. The cylinder, weighing abouta pound, fits snugly in the hand. You can quickly improve your delivery ofpunches by taking advantage of this exercise. Holding one of these cylinders ineach hand, stand with your feet parallel and punch directly in front of yournose several times. The idea behind this is to develop the snapping or whippingblows. If you keep your body and arms relaxed, you will notice that your puncheswill automatically snap back at the end of your delivery.[images/9780897502504_059.jpg]This training has a twofold purpose. It develops speed in your delivery as wellas in your power. After a while you will learn to punch with heaviness in yourblows even without the weights. The secret behind the exercise is to concentrateor pretend that your empty hands still contain the cylinders as you throw thepunches.In throwing a hard punch, it is easy to develop the bad habit of throwing yourshoulders out of line so only one shoulder does the work. In other words, thealignment of the shoulders can easily be disturbed, causing loss of power indelivery. To retain the coordination between the shoulders, Lee uses a staff, asin photos 1 and 2. By holding the staff with his hands far apart, he places iton his back shoulders. As he twists his body from one position to another, thelong staff keeps his shoulders straight in all the movements.After you have practiced with the cylinder weights for some time, you willnotice that your blows have more impact even without the weights. This is yourintroduction to the fact that your mind can do wonders to your physicalstrength. This extra power or strength is what Lee called “flowing energy,”which in aikido is called “ki” and in tai chi chuan is called “chi.”What you are now experiencing is just a small degree of flowing energy. Toenhance this energy, there are several exercises, and one of the best exercisesthat should be an integral part of your training is the chi sao, which wasbriefly described in Chapter 2 [9780897502504_epub_c02_r1.htm].[images/9780897502504_060.jpg]In performing chi sao to develop your energy, keep your body and arms relaxed,as in photos 1 to 6 (bird’s-eye view) and photos A and B (side view). As yourwrists touch your partner’s, as in figure A, just put enough stress in yourhands to roll your arms back and forth. In photos 1 to 6, Lee demonstrates howyour arms should be rolling. Arrows are indicated in each photo to illustratethe motion of the hands. The elbows are positioned close to the body as theyroll their arms constantly and smoothly. Though the arms appear to roll fromside to side, the concentration of your energy should be forward.The rolling motion is not the essence of chi sao. It is the flowing from yourarms that is important. The idea in the early stages is not to fight eachother’s strength but to concentrate on getting the feel of this energy. If youattempt to shove your partner backward, you will be missing the whole purpose ofchi sao. This forceful movement will tense your arms, and consequently, yourshoulders will become rigid. You will then lose your balance and begin to relyon brute strength instead of the flowing energy. Think of a screw that isturning inward. You never unwind the screw; you keep a small area inside andalways drive it forward.This energy must flow from the pit of your abdomen instead of your shoulders. Todo this, imagine that water is flowing through your arms like a hose being fedfrom the center of your body from about the navel. This causes the under part ofyour arms to become heavy. Keep your fingers loose and outstretched because thewater has to flow out from the little fingers.If both partners emit the same degree of energy or “water” through their arms,neither will penetrate the other. The motion will be constant, even andrhythmic. Each partner will feel the other’s arms as supple but firm. Arms lookweak, but they are very potent. Your elbows should be immovable—they can’t becoerced toward your body. Your pliable arms can be moved from side to side butnot toward your body. As you become more proficient, the circumference of yourmotion or rolling becomes smaller and smaller, as if the water flowing throughyour arms is now trying to penetrate and cover all the smaller cracks.[images/9780897502504_061.jpg][images/9780897502504_062.jpg]Chi sao is an important part of jeet kune do because its efficient applicationof techniques relies on the looseness of the arms and body. This exercise is thebest way to develop your flowing energy so you can be constantly relaxed andloose but not sacrifice power.To test if your energy is flowing, have someone extend his hand to you, thenland a chopping blow to his hand. First, do it normally and then do it with theflowing energy—concentrate on the heaviness of your hand, keep your arm looseand place the weight at the bottom of your arm. Don’t tell your partner what youare doing. After each blow, ask him whether he feels any difference. If he does,then hit his hand both with and without the flowing energy, letting him decideafter each blow whether the force is heavier or lighter. If the blows with theflowing energy are more powerful, you know you are doing it right. If you areunable to find anyone to cooperate with you, you can also test it on your ownhand.The incredible one-inch punch, as in photos 1, 2 and 3, which Lee used to awecrowds with at demonstrations, was possible because of his proficient use of hiships, flowing energy, punching through and the delivering of the punch. The fistis vertical and cocked at the wrist, as in photo A. The fist turns upwardsuddenly at impact, as in photo B. This vertical-fist punch is only used inclose quarters from five inches or less to the target. If you attempt to usethis punch from a distance, it will throw your timing off at impact. Theone-inch punch is really more for demonstration purposes. Generally, you neverwant to bend your wrist in a real fighting situation because you may injureyourself.[images/9780897502504_063.jpg][images/9780897502504_064.jpg][images/9780897502504_065.jpg]There are other ways to amplify the power of your flowing energy. You can do itwhile driving your car. Place your arms on the steering wheel as if you aredoing chi sao and put pressure on your arms. In photo A, it seems like Lee isdoing isometric exercises, but he is actually pressing his arms to the bar,flowing his energy. Fortunately, developing your flowing energy can be practicedanywhere that allows you to put pressure on one or both arms.Many who attempt the one-inch punch knock their opponents off their feet, butinstead of punching, they only push them down. You can’t hurt your opponent by apush. The art of punching is not pushing. In punching, the peak of your force orstrength is at the point of contact, but in pushing, the force begins from theoutset of the delivery and generally loses its power by the time your arm isfully extended. Punching comes from the rotation of your hips, while pushing isusually from the rear foot, propelling your body forward.When you are hitting, especially the heavy bag, punch through the bag. You willfind that you will have a deeper and stronger penetration if you do that insteadof concentrating on the surface of the bag. “Follow-through” means continuousacceleration of your punch to the target. However, the momentum or power doesnot cease there but extends through the target. It isn’t hitting your opponentbut driving through him. After driving through him, your punching hand should bewithdrawn as quickly as you thrust it forward.Don’t throw your punches in a windup motion; they should be thrown straight.Your fist clenches just before your whip-like impact. To add additional power,the free hand can be drawn suddenly and conjunctly toward your body at the pointof impact.If you are taking a step to throw a punch, your fist makes the contact beforeyour foot lands on the floor; otherwise, the body weight would be assimilatedonto the floor instead of behind your punch. Your hips and shoulders mustinitiate the action before your arm to deliver a rapid, precise and powerfulblow. Although your foot movement adds to your power, you can actually knock outyour opponent without taking a step or showing any strain in your action, ifdelivery is correctly done.A powerful blow depends on leverage and timing. Right timing is a must for apowerful blow. Without it, your impact is lost in motion—it may reach too earlyor too late.PULLING POWERAlthough Bruce Lee first studied wing chun kung fu, he improvised so manydifferent techniques that jeet kune do seems to have no bearing on kung fu. Leedid not completely discard wing chun’s techniques. He retained some of them butalso altered them so completely that they are not recognizable as the originalart.Two techniques he continued to practice were “lop sao” (grabbing the hand) and“pak sao” (slapping block), especially after doing chi sao. He was forced torevise both techniques because in wing chun both partners stand with theirbodies facing each other squarely and with their feet parallel. But in the JKDon-guard position, the partners stand with one foot forward, and the handextension is not the same.[images/9780897502504_066.jpg]Lee always believed that correct weight training could increase his power. Buthe was very selective in his exercise. He avoided drills that would developmuscles that would interfere with his performance in sparring or fighting.Besides the abdominal muscles, he concentrated heavily on his forearms becausehe believed they were the muscles depended on in punching and in pulling, as inlop sao. His drills included the reverse curl. To receive the most benefit fromthis, he covered the bar with a sponge so he lost his gripping power as hewrapped his hands over the sponge. When doing the exercise, he depended heavilyon his forearm muscles to carry the weights to his chest.Another excellent exercise for the forearms was the reverse extension. Insteadof curling his arms, he lifted the weights straight out in front of him. Withhis arms fully extended, he supported the weights for as long as possible atchest level.He also squeezed a rubber ball in his palm and worked with the wrist roller, asin photos 1 and 2. Using the dumbbell without the plates on one end, he twistedhis wrist back and forth.Lee developed such strength in his arms that when he jerked his partner, hesnapped his head backward as the body flew toward him. A contributing factorthat developed the pulling power was his persistent training of lop sao on thewing chun “dummy,” as in photo A. Besides developing the forearm muscles, hetoughened his arms by slamming them into the wooden arm.[images/9780897502504_067.jpg]While working out with weights, be sure to include speed and flexibilityexercises congruently. A heavy weightlifter with a great deal of power but noflexibility or speed will have a problem hitting his opponent. It will be like arhinoceros trying to corner a rabbit.POWER KICKINGStriking with your foot has several advantages. First, your leg is much morepowerful than your hand. Actually, kicking properly is the most powerful anddamaging blow you can administer. Second, your leg is longer than your hand, soit is your first line of attack, normally preceding your punch. Third, blockinga kick is very difficult, especially on the low-line areas like the shin, kneeand groin.[images/9780897502504_068.jpg]Unfortunately, too many martial artists do not profit from their assets. They dokick but without any power. Flicky or pole-like kicks, as in photos 1 to 3, arestill being used. They do not generate enough power to hurt or damage. In theflicky kicks, your weight is not behind the blow, and in the polelike kicks,your body is too off-balance.Bruce Lee’s forte was the side kick, as shown in photo A, which differs from theclassical side kick. In the classical, the side thrust kick has power but nospeed. The side snap kick has speed but no power. In jeet kune do’s side kick,both the snap and thrust are combined so there is no loss of power and speed.Lee used to drop a two-inch board from shoulder height and shatter it in halfbefore it landed on the ground. If his kick had only power but no snap, theboard would be hurled a distance without breaking, unless it was braced. If hiskick had the snap but no power, the board would not break because a two-inchboard without support is too thick to split with a snap kick.To do the side kick, stand with your feet apart and parallel to each other. Liftyour right foot about 12 inches from the floor as you balance on your left.Stomp your right foot straight down with force and let it snap upward about aninch from the floor. Like punching with flowing energy, here again, you shouldconcentrate with heaviness in your foot. In other words, the water is nowflowing through your right leg (hose), and when it is fully extended by yourdownward stomp (gushing of the water), it snaps upward (splashes explosively).Until you warm up your legs by light kicking, do not stomp your foot violently.[images/9780897502504_069.jpg]Now you are set to kick sideways. As in stomping, place all your weight on yourleft foot as you lift your right foot and kick straight out instead of down.Your left knee should be bent slightly so you can lean a little backward and notforward, like most beginners do. Pivot on the ball of your left foot as youthrust your right foot forward. For extra power, twist your hips just an instantbefore the full extension of your leg—it gives you the screwdriver or thetwisting force in your kick. Then snap your foot at the full extension for thewhipping effect.If you like to kick something solid, you can hit any wood or concrete wall.Measure your distance to the wall and just kick it. Because your foot should belanding flat, you will not hurt yourself. A forceful kick will just bounce yourbody backward because the wall will not flex.After you have the knack of doing the side kick, you are prepared to kick theheavy bag. From the on-guard position, do the forward burst, as explained inChapter 3 [9780897502504_epub_c03_r1.htm]. Aim your blow directly at the centerof the bag, as in photos 1, 2 and 3.At impact, your foot should land horizontally on the bag and not obliquely. Thesound at impact should be a loud, cracking thud like a whip if you have kickedthrough the bag and snapped your foot at the end. If there is more push thanhit, the sound will be a light or weak thud. In both kicks, force is exerted,except the hit will do the damage and the push will just knock the opponent downinnocuously.If you lunge at the bag swiftly and keep your body in balance, you can generatemore power in your kick than you ever thought possible. Generally, the kick isdelivered with your body lunging close to the floor to keep you in balance evenafter the execution. But for a much more powerful blow, lift your body a littlehigher while moving toward the bag, and just as you are propelling your rightfoot through the bag, stomp or drive your left foot downward. In other words,the force is now being exerted from both legs. This may be the way of deliveringa punishing blow without a weapon.One note of caution: If you miss the bag completely or don’t hit it solidly, youcan hurt your kicking knee. The reason is that your foot is hurling much fasterthan your body, and when you miss, it is like someone jerking your leg out ofthe knee socket.In real fighting or sparring, it is not too practical to utilize the latter kickbecause it can easily leave you off-balance if you miss. Furthermore, the higheryou leap, the more time you allow your opponent to avoid your attack.[images/9780897502504_070.jpg]The heavy bag is one of the most valuable apparatuses in jeet kune do and, as amatter of fact, in the other martial arts, too, because one can practice on italone. You can have a good workout by just doing the side kicks on itcontinuously for several minutes. As you kick the bag, let it swing back eachtime before kicking it again.To teach a beginner in kicking, hold the bag for him by placing your knee at thebottom rim of the bag and both your hands gently behind the center area of thebag to avoid having your fingers crushed. Before you ever stand with your backfacing the bag, be sure you know the strength of the kicker. In photo 1, Lee hitthe bag so hard that the impact sent the person behind it flying across theroom, causing an injury to his neck that lasted for several days from thewhiplash.[images/9780897502504_071.jpg]Lee always believed that you should practice hitting different types of targetsto get a different feeling from each on impact. He used the heavy bag mostly,but he often kicked at the wall canvas, beanbag or sandbag, the punching pad,the wooden dummy as in photo A, and the portable heavy shield as in photo B.[images/9780897502504_072.jpg][images/9780897502504_073.jpg]After the heavy bag, Lee’s next favorite apparatuses to kick were the heavyshield and the air bag because he could exert all his power onto a moving targetwithout really hurting the holder, as in photos 1, 2 and 3.Although the front kick is not as powerful as the side kick, Lee increased theexplosiveness of his kick by the use of his hips. Instead of relying only on thesnap of the foot from the knee, he jerked his hips forward just an instantbefore his foot made con­tact, as in photos A and B. The timing of this movementis very important and difficult to do. Practice it daily until you have theknack of it.The text attempts to illustrate a step-by-step instruction of doing the sidekick. But once you understand how to deliver it, you should do it withouthesitation but in one smooth, fluid motion.[images/9780897502504_074.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_075.jpg]CHAPTER 5SPEED TRAININGWhat is speed in fighting? Is it the velocity of your hands, feet and bodymovement? Or are there other, more prevalent essentials in a good fighter? Whatis a good fighter?To answer these questions: A good fighter is a person who can hit his opponentquicker, harder, without much perceptible effort and yet avoid being hit. Hedoesn’t only possess a pair of fast hands and feet or quick body movements buthas other qualities such as nontelegraphic moves, good coordination, perfectbalance and keen awareness. Although some people are endowed with a few of thesequalities, most of these attributes are developed through hard training.All the strength or power you have developed from your training is wasted if youare slow and can’t make contact. Power and speed go hand in hand. A fighterneeds both to be successful.One immediate way to increase your speed at impact is to “snap” or “whip” yourhand or foot just before contact. It is the same principle as the overhandthrow. For example, if you throw a baseball by fully swinging your arm andsnapping your wrist at the last moment or at the tail end of your swing, theball will have more velocity than without the snap. Naturally, the longer swingwith a snap will have more acceleration at the end than a shorter swing with asnap. A 12-foot whip, flung exactly, will generate more sting than a two-footwhip.SPEED IN PUNCHINGThe backfist punch is neither the quickest nor is it very strong because you areunable to utilize the total body movement. But it is one blow in which you canfully apply the whipping or snapping motion. First, it is thrown more like aswing than a forward thrust, which means you can put more momentum in thedelivery. Second, there is more elasticity or freedom of motion in your wristwhen bending it from side to side (palm to knuckles) rather than up and down(thumb to little finger). That means you are able to whip or snap it morevigorously, as in photo A.The backfist is used mostly to strike the head section of your opponent. It isused heavily in combination with lop sao (grabbing-the-hand technique), as inphoto B. It is delivered at shoulder height, but it can also be used as asurprise attack and be launched anywhere from your waistline to your shoulder.It is very difficult to block once you have acquired the nontelegraphic moves.[images/9780897502504_076.jpg]Although some power is lost in this punch, it is compensated for or redeemedwhen combined with lop sao. If you can develop a strong pulling power in yourarm, you will be able to jerk your opponent forward and apply the backfistpunch. The impact should be devastating when your knuckles hit your oppo­nent’sface. It is like two fast-moving cars colliding, head-on.To develop speed or quickness in the backfist punch, light a candle and attemptto blow it out with the acceleration of your punch. Another interesting exerciseis to have a partner attempt to block your punch as you throw it at his face,with control. If he misses his block, you should be able to stop your punchabout one-quarter inch from his skin.[images/9780897502504_077.jpg]Lee also used the bouncing head dummy, as in photo X, which was created strictlyfor solitary training. The head is padded and resilient to take hard blows.The leading finger jab is the fastest attacking weapon available to you. It isfast in reaching your target because it travels only a short distance. It isalso the longest hand weapon accessible to you. Because you do not clench yourfist but have your fingers extended, you add several more inches to your reach,as in photos 1 and 2.Power is not needed in this technique because you focus your aim at the eyes ofyour enemy. Instead, your important assets are accuracy and speed. The jab is athreatening and dangerous weapon to the adversary because it does so much damageand is so difficult to defend against.To protect yourself from damaging your fingers, if you should ever miss and hita hard object such as the head or a bone of your enemy, learn to form your handproperly. Align the tip of your hand, as in photo A, by slightly bending thelonger fingers to adjust to the shorter and tuck your thumb in. Your hand shouldresemble a spear.To develop speed in the finger jab, you need a great deal of practice, and mostof this will be the result of your own initiative. Speed relies on economy ofmotion, and the jab is one technique with which you have the opportunity toexperiment. The jab, like all the JKD blows, must be thrust forward without anyretracting motion. It is like a snake darting at its prey without warning.[images/9780897502504_078.jpg]The more hours you spend in speed hitting, the faster your hands will travel, astime goes by. Like the boxer who whips out his hands while jogging, you mustalso take solitary training seriously. One excellent training device for this isthe paper target, as in photo B. It is so inexpensive and easy to construct andyet very valuable to anyone who wants to enhance his speed in punching orjabbing.[images/9780897502504_079.jpg][images/9780897502504_080.jpg]Besides the paper target, Lee used to practice on a thick leather strip totoughen his fingers, as in photo X. He also worked heavily on the bouncing headdummy, as in photo Y, which is excellent for finger jabbing. It gives whenstruck but is solid enough to harden the fingers.Although the wooden dummy is too solid to jab your fingers into, it is avaluable apparatus with which to practice the finger jab combination, as inphoto Z. It’s like a real-life opponent with its arms outstretched and its legimpeding your approach.The leading finger jab is the fastest hand weapon, and the leading straight isthe fastest of all the punches. The leading straight is the backbone punch ofjeet kune do. It is the main offensive weapon, but it is also an importantdefensive tool to stop and intercept a complex attack in an instant.Although the leading straight punch has been discussed in Chapter 4[9780897502504_epub_c04_r1.htm], power is not one of its leadingcharacteristics. Actually, the leading straight punch is more appropriatelyclassified as a “speed punch.” Like the finger jab, it travels only a shortdistance to the target, as in photos 1, 2 and 3, because that hand is alreadyextended and closer to its target.[images/9780897502504_081.jpg]Besides being the fastest punch, the straight lead is also the most accuratebecause it is delivered straightforward, at a close distance, and your balanceis left intact. Like the finger jab, it is hard to block, especially if you keepit in a continuous, small motion. Besides, it can be delivered faster while inmotion than from a fixed position. Like the finger jab, it keeps the opponent onedge by its threatening gesture.Put some “zip” into your punch by snapping it just before impact. Keep your handloose, and tighten your fist only an instant before contact. To putexplosiveness in the blow, utilize the flowing-energy concept by addingheaviness to your hand.The straight lead is not an end but a means to an end. It is not a powerful blowthat will knock your opponent flat with one punch, but it is the most dominatingpunch in jeet kune do and is used profusely with the other combination punchesand kicks.The straight punch should be delivered from an on-guard position with the pointof contact in line with the surface of your shoulder, as in photos 1, 2 and 3.Against a short opponent or if you are hitting at the low-line level, bend yourknees so your shoulders are aligned to the point of contact. Likewise, if he isa tall person, stand on the balls of your feet.[images/9780897502504_082.jpg][images/9780897502504_083.jpg]Later, as you progress, the straight punch should be thrown from any position inwhich your hand happens to be, without any extra motion, like retracting it orpulling your shoulder back before delivery. But the punch must be launched withyour body in balance to be effective.Unlike the classical stance, the hand is never placed on your hip, as in photosA, B and C, nor is the punch initiated from there. It is impractical to haveyour hand traveling the extra, needless distance. Furthermore, delivery of yourpunch from the hip exposes a large area of your body during the action.As discussed in the last chapter, the leading right will have more sting if youpivot your hips and utilize all the other functions for a heavy blow. Butsometimes this will telegraph your movement, and you have to decide whether tosacrifice speed for power. This depends on your opponent. If he is very slow andawkward, you can utilize the powerful blows and still make contact. But if he isfast, you may have to concentrate on speed more than power. Among the bestequipment to develop speed and accuracy in your punch­ing is the old-fashionedspeed bag, as in photo X (see page 96). The bag, supported by an elastic line tothe ceiling and a rope to the floor, is suspended to your shoulder level. To usethe bag properly, you have to be quick with your hands. You have to hit thetarget perfectly so the bag will bounce directly back to you, and you need goodtiming with your hands.[images/9780897502504_084.jpg]In the beginning, use both hands to punch the bag and stand with your feetparallel but comfortably apart. Hit the bag directly straight, using your noseas the guiding point. The most valuable feature of the bag is that it compelsyou to hit directly and crisply and not push or it will not return to yousharply. But once you have the knack of punching it after several practices, youcan then train in the on-guard position and employ the fist-and-elbowcombination. Hit with your fist and block or strike with your elbow and forearm,as in photo Y.[images/9780897502504_085.jpg]You cannot hit the bag standing in the classical style, with your punchdelivered from your hip, because it will be too late for you to react after thefirst punch. You are liable to be hit on your face because your hands will notbe able to protect your head from the oncoming bag.The punching pads, as shown in photo Z, are pieces of versatile equipment usedto increase speed and heavy punching for kicking and applying combinations. Youcan work with one or two pieces.In photos 1 and 2, Lee practices an explosive leading right punch with just onepad. Besides explosiveness, the one pad is good for developing speed in yourpunch. Have your partner hold out the pad. Whenever you attempt to punch, hejerks it swiftly either upward or downward, trying to make you miss when youattempt to hit it squarely.[images/9780897502504_086.jpg][images/9780897502504_087.jpg]In photos 1, 2 and 3, Lee throws his leading right and follows up with his leftto the second pad. With a pair of pads, your partner can help you develop speed,aim and coordination by moving himself and his hands around—revealing a pair ofelusive targets.[images/9780897502504_088.jpg]Punching the wall canvas bag is not recommended for speed. To develop speed, youmust hit with speed in mind and not power. If you hit with full power all thetime, you will be sacrificing speed. Even while hitting the heavy bag, as inphotos A and B, you can hit with a combination of speed and power. Use yourdominating, leading hand mostly for speed and your rear hand for power. Fromtime to time, you can throw heavy punches from both hands as you “crowd” thebag.The wooden dummy can also be used to learn speed punching with combination blowsand parries, as in photos A and B. The disadvantage for a person who hasn’tworked on the dummy before is that he can injure himself if his fists are notconditioned to hit solid objects.[images/9780897502504_089.jpg]The lead is almost like the leading straight punch, except that it lacks theforce of the latter punch. It is used mostly as a “feeler” in the early roundsof sparring or in the beginning of a fight between two crafty fighters. The leadjab is used as a cautious measure to study the opponent in motion. When twoevenly matched, skilled fighters meet, sometimes the lead jab is used throughoutthe fight.The lead jab is generally the dominating hand technique in boxing, but in jeetkune do, it is the leading straight punch. Both techniques have almost the samefeatures: speed, accuracy, short delivery, body balance in delivery, and bothare hard to block.In offense, the lead jab is used to keep the opponent off-balance and to createopenings for more punishing blows. In defense, it is an effective maneuver tostop or meet an attack. For example, you can “beat your opponent to the punch”by throwing a quick jab to his face just as he is about to launch an attack. Thejab can also be delivered from an extended arm to “stiff-arm” him, which keepsyour opponent at a distance and prevents him from close-range fighting.The jab is mostly focused on the face because it lacks force and does littledamage to the body. It is a weaker, pestering strike, which is good as astratagem to use against an opponent. It is also thrown with looseness in yourarm and a snap before impact.An excellent child’s game that is fun and can be played with anyone is the“slapping” match. Extend your arm fully in front of you with your handoutstretched. Your thumb is on the top as you hold it vertically. When yourpartner swings his hand to slap yours, you react by jerking it suddenly upwardand toward you, trying your best to avoid contact. You let him do the slappinguntil he misses, then you reverse roles.NONTELEGRAPHIC PUNCHOne of the most distinctive features that sets jeet kune do apart from theclassical styles of kung fu and boxing is that Bruce Lee incorporated thenontelegraphic aspects of fencing. By adopting part of its footwork and applyingthe principle of thrusting the hand before your body, it is almost impossible toparry or block the speed punches such as the backfist, jab or the lead punch.The concept behind this is that if you initiate your punch without anyforewarning, such as tensing your shoulders or moving your foot or body, theopponent will not have enough time to react. When he sees the punch coming—thatis, if he ever sees it—it will be too late for him to block or parry it.Actually, the punch already makes contact, and your hand is snapping back whenyour body edges forward. It is the exact movement of the fencer who thrusts hisfoil forward and does not move forward until his hand is being retracted.If you punch simultaneously, with just a slight motion of your feet or body, youhave telegraphed or warned your opponent of your intention. The secret in thenontelegraphic move is to relax your body and arms but keep them weaving in aslight motion. Whip out your hand loosely so your shoulders don’t tense, andclench your hand just an instant before contact as you snap it. You have to keepa “poker face” while facing your opponent. A slight twitch or expression on yourface may trigger your intention and warn your opponent.[images/9780897502504_090.jpg]Lee was so good in speed punching that he had a problem getting volunteers tocome to him when he demonstrated in karate tournaments. Even the champions wereafraid to confront him because most of them knew of his prowess with his hands.In photos 1 and 2, Lee demonstrated his speed against a karate black belt. Evenafter indicating to the volunteer where his punch would be directed, the blackbelt was unable to block his punch in eight tries. Lee was successful not justbecause of his quick hands but because of his flawless, nontelegraphic movement.Use your nontelegraphic punch with your forward shuffle, as discussed in Chapter3 [9780897502504_epub_c03_r1.htm]. Practice the backfist first, then the fingerjab and finally the leading straight punch.In the beginning, punch or jab into the air and subsequently on the papertarget. Later, use the punching pad. Like training in speed punching, have yourpartner jerk the pad quickly when you throw your punch, trying his utmost tomake you miss it.Another exercise that you can include in your training is the “clapping” game.Stand about a full arm’s length plus another four or five inches away from yourpartner. Let him keep his hands about a foot apart in front of him. The idea isto throw a punch to his face or body straight between his hands. It is a test asto whether you can hit the target and snap your fist before he can clap itbetween his hands.If he can’t, then let him reduce the distance between his hands until it is onlyabout six inches. You can also step farther away from him while delivering yourpunch. But before you attempt to do this drill, be sure that you can controlyour punch. If he misses your blow, you should be able to stop your punch justabove the surface of his skin.It may be wise to learn control in punching first before you attempt theclapping exercise. Have your partner stand motionless; throw your punches abouttwo inches from his face. Then gradually throw your punch closer and closeruntil you are barely touching his skin. Your partner should only feel the draftfrom your action. In the meantime, your partner can learn not to blink as theblow almost brushes his face.[images/9780897502504_091.jpg]SPEED IN KICKINGThe most dominating JKD kicks are the side and hook kicks. The side kick can beused with quickness and power, while the hook kick is used mostly for speed. Injeet kune do, most of the kicks are launched from the leading foot, shorteningthe distance between yourself and the target.The hook kick is focused generally on the upper line—from the waist to the head.It is especially effective when directed to the ribs of your opponent, justbelow his arm, as in photo A. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the leg isstronger than the hand so even a fast kick like the hook can disable youropponent with just one blow.The hook kick is more difficult to learn than the side kick because it is harderto deliver and because it tends to throw you off-balance in the process,especially on the high kicks.To do the hook kick, stand in the on-guard position, as in photo 1. Lift yourlead knee until your thigh is horizontal, as in photo 2. Your lower leg (belowthe knee) should hang loosely and point to the floor at about a 45-degree angle.Your weight should be completely on the rear foot with the knee slightly bentand your body leaning backward. Then pivot on the ball of your rear foot, whichautomatically induces your hips to rotate. Finally, snap your foot from theknee, which straightens the supporting leg, as in photos 3 and 4. The hook kickis performed with just one motion from the time your foot leaves the floor. Youreyes should be constantly on the target and your kick is aimed not at thesurface of the target but through it. Your foot, like the punch, should snap orwhip just before impact.[images/9780897502504_092.jpg][images/9780897502504_093.jpg][images/9780897502504_094.jpg]One fault of a beginner is that he leans too far forward and includes twomotions in his hook kick. After raising his knee, he has a tendency to swing hisfoot back to deliver the kick. (See the chart on the path of your foot.) Itslows down delivery, and the two motions weaken his blow because of thehesitation and the fact that he does not completely utilize the combined forceof the hip and leg action, as Lee demonstrates in photos A, B, C and D.The hook kick is usually quickly delivered with the quick advance footwork fromthe on-guard position, as in photo 1. Step forward about three inches, as inphoto 2, then slide your rear foot quickly forward, as in photo 3. Just beforeyour rear foot makes contact with the front one, lift your front foot to applythe kick, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_095.jpg][images/9780897502504_096.jpg]Sometimes, your opponent may “crowd” you and you may find yourself quite closeto him. In this predicament, omit the three-inch step and, instead, from theon-guard position, as in photo 1, slide your rear foot quickly forward justbehind the front foot, as in photo 2. Then, before your opponent can react, youshould be launching your hook kick, as in photo 3. This movement should be donewith one fluid motion and with no hesitation or jerkiness in between.[images/9780897502504_097.jpg]Other times, you may find yourself caught at intervals. You may be too close toyour opponent to take the three-inch step and too far to use the short slide, asin photo 2. When you are in that position, just do the forward burst or lunge,as in photo Y, before delivering the hook kick.Although the hook kick is generally used for the upper-line attack, often it isaimed at the groin area, as in photos A and B. This depends on the angle of yourbody to your opponent’s. Many times you will learn that it is the only practicalkick to reach the hard-to-hit areas.[images/9780897502504_098.jpg][images/9780897502504_099.jpg]There are several apparatuses you can train on to develop your hook kick. One ofthe most practical and least expensive is the paper target. From an on-guardposition, kick the target at first without stepping out. Get the “feel” orbalance of your stance and the path of your foot. Pay close attention to thesnap at impact.Gradually kick into harder objects such as the light bag, as in photo A, and theheavy bag. For combination hand and foot techniques, use the wooden dummy, as inphoto B. Once you have acquired the knack of delivering the hook kickautomatically, practice with a moving target such as the punching pad. In thebeginning, just use one. Later, incorporate the other so you can drill both yourleft and right foot.Although your instep is generally the point of contact in the hook kick, otherregions of your foot can be used, such as the ball, toe or shin. But avoid usingthe toe or ball if you are sparring barefoot.[images/9780897502504_100.jpg][images/9780897502504_101.jpg]In most hitting, the powerful blows are usually slower than the lighter ones.But the side kick, which is the hardest blow you can release, is also a fastkick. If directed toward the low line such as the opponent’s knee or shin, as inphotos 1 and 2, it can be just as swift as the hook kick. Bruce Lee used to dohis low-line side kicks almost as rapidly as throwing his leading jab. It wasfascinating to see him chase his opponent, who was completely off-balance whilereeling backward.[images/9780897502504_102.jpg]To develop a speed side kick, stand in the on-guard position and imagine thatyour opponent’s leading leg is in front of you. Keep your eyes focused at yourimaginary foe’s face as you deliver a series of side kicks angling downward. Theidea of this drill is to thrust your foot strongly but with speed and snap. Thewooden dummy can also be used to practice the low side kick, as in photo A, orin combination with other hand or other foot techniques.Another fast kick is the front or the upward groin kick. It is delivered almostexactly like the hook kick. Instead of the kick being directed to the side ofyour opponent, so your foot travels obliquely, the kick is to the groin andtravels straight upward or vertically. If used with your hip motion, asdiscussed in Chapter 4 [9780897502504_epub_c04_r1.htm], you can generate a muchmore powerful blow than with the hook kick.[images/9780897502504_103.jpg]The front kick is not employed too often in JKD sparring because the on-guardstance doesn’t allow too many opportunities for its use. But it is an effectiveweapon against many fighters who don’t protect their groin area well.Although the ball or toe of your foot can be the point of contact, predominantlythe instep and shin are used. It can be delivered more accurately than with thetoe or ball. Your foot will be traveling upward between your opponent’s legs, asin photos 1 and 2. It is almost impossible to miss the target.In sparring, infrequently you do have an opportunity to use the front kick. Forexample, after avoiding an attack, you may be able to swing your opponent aroundso his back faces you, as in photos A and B.For your daily training, you can practice the front kick by hitting the bottomrim of a heavy bag. Other light bags or balls that can be suspended from theceiling are excellent for practicing your skill against a moving object. Thepunching pad can be employed, too, by having your partner hold it horizontallywith his palm facing the floor. Like the other techniques, the wooden dummy isused for combinations, as in photo Y, but you can’t kick it too hard withoutrisking injury to your foot.[images/9780897502504_104.jpg]AWARENESSSome athletes seem to have greater peripheral vision than others, like abasketball player who seems to know where each player is and always seems tofind the open man, or like a quarterback who always sees the unguarded receiver.Some experts in the sports field believe that the exceptionally high degree ofperipheral vision possessed by a few athletes is innate. But they also believethat this trait can be broadened by everyone through constant practice.In martial arts, you may not need as wide a range of vision as in other sportsif you are confronted by a single person. But you surely need it when surroundedby two or more attackers.To develop peripheral vision, focus your eyes at a distant structure, such as ahigh building or a pole. Then diffuse your sight so you can still see thestructure clearly but also the blurry environment bordering it. Take note of anymovements from both corners of your eyes.In training, work with three or more people and spread them out. Your eyes seemto focus on the person in the middle, but your vision is actually on all ofthem. As one of them moves, no matter how slightly, call out his name.Against one opponent, your eyes should be fixed on his eyes, but your visionshould encompass his whole body, as in photo A. Your vision sphere is moreextensive when focused at a distance, and as you focus your sight closer, yoursphere becomes smaller. Against an individual, it is harder to follow his handmotion—even though his hands are closer to your eyes than his feet—because handsmove faster than feet.[images/9780897502504_105.jpg]One high-ranking martial artist was amazed at Bruce Lee’s quick hand and footreaction. Lee had the ability to kick just before his opponent kicked and punchjust before his opponent punched. To those who saw him for the first time, heseemed to have an instinct or a sixth sense that let him read other people’sminds. It could be frustrating to spar with someone like him because he was uponyou before you could even blink your eye.The secret of Lee’s quick reaction was his highly developed sense of awareness,cultivated by years of training. It complement­ed his hand and foot techniques.Just the acceleration of your foot and hand doesn’t necessarily mean that youwill beat your opponent to the punch or kick. In other words, speed alonedoesn’t guarantee that your blow will reach your opponent before his reachesyou. But by cultivating your keen sense of awareness, your chance of beating himis enhanced tremendously.How does one develop his keen awareness? One way is to be alert to yoursurroundings. Learn to react quickly. For instance, while in a restaurant orother public place, select a person from the crowd and follow his movement.Whenever he or she gesticulates, you respond by a silent “ugh” or any otherquiet, sharp sound. Gradually, increase your response by attempting toanticipate or beat his gesture with an “ugh.”If you have a dog, practice keen awareness by holding a rag before him. Wheneverhe jumps for it, react with an “ugh” as you simultaneously jerk the rag from hisgrasp. At the outset, hold the rag high, but as your reaction quickens, lower ittoward him. You will be surprised how much this simple exercise can shorten yourresponse time.If you aren’t convinced, do the same exercise without the sound and, instead,just jerk the rag away. You will then realize how slow your reaction can be.An exercise that you can do with your partner is allowing him to gesticulatequickly as you react to him. Then later, hold the punching pad in front of himand let him hit it. As he throws his speed punch, jerk your hand quickly with asimultaneous “ugh.” Incredibly, this simple exercise can add a great deal ofspeed to your punch and kick."},{"pageContent":"PART IISKILL IN TECHNIQUES"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_106.jpg]CHAPTER 6SKILL IN MOVEMENTSkill in movement is very important in the art of fighting. It is heavily reliedon in attack, defense, deception and conservation of energy. It is yourproficiency in mobility or footwork that allows you to control the precisedistance between you and your opponent. The strategy of footwork is to takeadvantage of your opponent’s footwork with your own. Your attack or defense maybe based on the opponent’s foot pattern of advancing and backing off.When you learn his foot pattern, adjust to it. You can then press (advance) orfall back (retreat) just enough to facilitate a hit. The length of your step iscoordinated to your opponent’s movement. Intuition in moving forward andbackward is also an intuition of when to attack and when to defend.A skilled fighter never stays in one spot long; he is in constant motion tobaffle his opponent, causing him to misjudge the distance. A moving target isharder to hit, and by being in motion, you can move more quickly than from a setposition.By varying the distance and timing of your movement continuously, you canconfuse your opponent. You will disturb his preparation to attack or defend,keeping him off-balance.You must practice footwork with punching and kicking. Without footwork, thefighter is like an immobile cannon that cannot be directed at the enemy line.The speed and power of your punches and kicks depends on your nimble feet andbalanced body.A good fighter like Bruce Lee always seemed to do everything with ease, finesseand grace. He moved into his opponent, landed his blow without any effort andeasily moved out of range. He always seemed to outhit and outguess his opponent.His timing was so good that he controlled even the opponent’s rhythm. He movedwith assurance and coordination.A poor fighter, on the other hand, seems to move clumsily. He can’t find thecorrect distance, telegraphs his intentions and never seems to outthink hisopponent. Instead of controlling his opponent, he lets the opponent control him.DISTANCEDistance continuously changes between two skilled fighters as both attempt toseek the most advantageous position. The best idea is to stay consistently outof range of the opponent’s simple punch but not too far away to deliver anattack with just a short step forward. This distance is contingent not only onyour own speed and agility but also that of your opponent.In boxing, the fighters stand closer to each other than martial artists becausemartial artists utilize their feet to kick. The leg is longer than the arm, sothe martial artist has a longer reach than a boxer.[images/9780897502504_107.jpg]In jeet kune do, there are three different distances in fighting. Generally, thelongest range is employed when you don’t know your opponent’s prowess or hisintention, as in photo 1, and you want to “feel” or “test” him out. In defense,it is wiser to stay too far away instead of too close to your opponent. But in alengthy struggle, you are only safe at a distance if you can really outclassyour opponent with speed and agility in movement.Even if you are fast, it is difficult to parry a blow if you are too near youropponent. The one who initiates the attack usually has an advantage in closequarters. But an attacker who can’t properly figure out distance will notsucceed, even if he is accurate, quick, has good timing and utilizes economy ofmovement.Once you think that you have the “feel” of your opponent, you move closer tohim, to the medium distance, as in photo 2. From this distance, you can be justout of his range and yet close enough to launch an attack. It is a safe distanceif you can also apply good timing. A skillful fighter will maneuver to enticehis opponent to shorten the gap or distance until the opponent is too near toavoid the trap.[images/9780897502504_108.jpg]This medium distance also allows you to avoid any blow by a quick retreat or abackward burst. But to use this defensive strategy continuously is not alwayspractical because it deprives you of a counterattack or delivery of your ownoffense. In jeet kune do, you retreat just far enough to evade the blow, but youstay just close enough for a counterattack.Close-distance fighting usually is a consequence of an attack or acounterattack. It is harder to defend from this distance unless you have alreadytrapped your opponent’s arms. Definitely, the advantage is to the one whoinitiates the attack. At a close distance, as in photo 3, the fighter with theexpertise of his hands will outwit the kicker.However, a martial artist, unlike a boxer, needs to be alert to blows from theelbows, knees, head, etc., in close-range fighting. He also has to be aware ofthe chance of being thrown or grappled to the ground.[images/9780897502504_109.jpg]In boxing, the fighters have difficulty in closing in, and once they are there,it is more difficult for them to remain there. In martial arts, because the feetare employed, it is even more difficult to close in than in boxing. But once thefighters are in close proximity, the fight or match is over quickly becausemartial artists have too many offensive tactics to use.In close-range fighting, it is imperative that you immobilize your opponent’slead foot by placing yours next to his, as in photo 3. This procedure should bedone automatically because, at that close range, your concentration will beheavily focused on your hand techniques.[images/9780897502504_110.jpg]Lee constructed the metal bar on the wooden dummy to simulate his opponent’sleg, as in photos A and B. At the outset, he had to concentrate heavily on theplacement of his lead foot, but after a few months, it became a natural andhabitual procedure.An infighting maneuver that Lee used frequently was to keep his opponentoff-balance by pressing him, as in photos Y and Z. This tactic can be usedagainst anyone, even a heavier and stronger opponent. Practice this with yourpartner by bending your knees slightly, placing your weight on the front footand shoving your partner vigorously without letting up. Your feet advance with ashuffle, and you use your hand and body to trap your partner’s arms. The secretbehind this force is to use your hips and not entirely your shoulders when youare pressing him.Once you have your partner reeling backward, you can use your free hand to hithis body and then pin him to the ground. It is a safe maneuver because yourpartner cannot take the offensive. He is too off-balance to retaliate.The better fighter is always maneuvering, trying to stay in the range that suitshim best. He is just out of the opponent’s attack range and patiently waits forthe right moment to close in or draw the opponent toward him. He may attack asthe opponent advances or when he sees an opening while the opponent is changinghis pace or position.The attack or retreat should be rapid, penetrating and spontaneous. The opponentshould not be able to predict your movement until it is too late for him toretaliate or defend an attack. The ideal time for the attack to be delivered iswhen he is in a stupor.Distance is so vital that even a small mistake in range can render an attackharmless. You should launch your attack just before the opponent is at yourdesired distance—not after he reaches the desired range. It is like in baseballwhen the outfielder begins to run in the right direction even before the batterswings the bat. Or it is like a football quarterback who throws the ball at thespot just before the receiver reaches it.[images/9780897502504_111.jpg]FOOTWORKAgainst a fighter who has a good sense of distance and is difficult to reach infrontal attacks, the maneuver to “bridge the gap,” or to close the distance, isa series of steps backward while progressively shortening them. Or you can letyour opponent take the initiative as he closes the distance when he lunges atyou.If you are against a defensive fighter with a good sense of distance, advancewith a series of steps, making the first step smooth and economical. A clevermaneuver is to advance a step or two and then retreat, enticing the opponent topursue. If he does, allow him to take a step or two, then surprise him with aburst forward right into his track at the precise instant he raises his foot tostep forward.To confuse your opponent, vary the length of your steps and your speed, but useshort steps when changing position. You can only refine your sense of distanceby moving smoothly and quickly.While sparring or fighting, use good footwork to be as near to your opponent aspossible for retaliation. Move lightly with your knees slightly bent, alwaysready to spring forward when the opportunity arises.Stepping forward with a feint adds speed to the attack and often createsopenings as the opponent is forced to commit himself. Stepping back can bestrategically used against an opponent who doesn’t want to engage inclose-quarter fighting or who stays too far away to be reached.In photo 1, Lee remains at a far distance, cautiously waiting for the opponentto make his move. Just as his opponent launches his attack, as in photo 2, Leequickly counters by moving in and clashing his leg against the opponent’s leadleg, preventing him from delivering his high hook kick, as in photo 3. Afterstopping the attack, Lee takes the offensive by throwing a right punch, as inphoto 4.In order to beat his opponent to the blow, Lee needed quick reactions that camefrom his daily workouts, especially in developing his keen sense of awareness.You should also notice that he doesn’t deliver his punch while his right foot isoff the ground or when his body is not in alignment. His punch will make itscontact as his body moves forward and his foot is just about planted.You should always conceal your intention from your opponent. Sometimes, insteadof countering by moving in, you do the opposite by moving back. In photos 1 and2, Lee moves back and calculates the opponent’s timing and attack. He moves justfar enough to ward off the penetrating side kick, as in photo 3, and still be ina good position to retaliate, as he does in photos 4 and 5, with a punishingpunching attack.[images/9780897502504_112.jpg]In another illustration of the moving-back maneuver, the opponent fakes a punchto Lee’s face, as in photos A and B. Lee reacts to the feint, as in photo C, butis fast enough to recover and move away from the real attack, as in photo D. Hemoves just enough to brush off the side kick and then counters—this time with ahigh hook kick to the opponent’s face, as in photo E.By retreating, you allow the opponent some room to kick, so it is a smart tacticsometimes to crowd or press him from launching his attack. A wise fightergenerally strives to be an elusive and difficult target by not moving forward orbackward in a straight direction from a medium distance.[images/9780897502504_113.jpg][images/9780897502504_114.jpg]In both counters, Lee has to lunge forward to reach the opponent and has to doit quickly before the opponent can recover to defend himself.SIDE STEPPING AND DUCKINGIn jeet kune do, side stepping is a defensive science to avoid a punch or akick. If done properly, it is a safe and valuable movement for counterattacking.The purpose of side stepping is not to avoid the opponent’s onrush but his blow.If the attack is shallow, the counter is quite simple. But if the attack ispenetrating, such as a rush or deep lunge, it is not that easy. You have to movejust enough to avoid the blow and be close enough to turn quickly and pounce onhim just as he, or the blow, bypasses you.[images/9780897502504_115.jpg]In far-distance fighting, the defender usually has the advantage because he hasenough time to prepare for the attack and has time to counter accordingly. Inphoto 1, Lee waits for his opponent to attack, and once the attack is on itsway, he sidesteps to his left at the last moment, as in photos 2 and 3, barelyavoiding the side kick. It is such a subtle movement that it does not“telegraph” or unbalance his body.Once a kick or punch is committed, the attacker cannot deviate his blow from itspath and expect to land it effectively. If the opponent is off his feet, as inphoto 3, he has no way to alter his course.[images/9780897502504_116.jpg]In photo 4, the opponent lands just in front of Lee, perfect for acounterattack. In photos 5, 6 and 7, although Lee is in a good position to use afront kick to his opponent’s groin, he throws a right punch and follows it up bydragging him to the floor.Against an opponent’s right lead punch, sidestep to the left by swaying yourbody and ducking your head toward the left without any loss of balance. As hispunch passes over your head, pivot your body by throwing your hips into theopponent and simultaneously delivering a right to his body or jaw.Ducking is dipping your body forward from the waist mostly to let the blow passover your head. Its primary function is to avoid blows and still be in range tocounterattack.[images/9780897502504_117.jpg]This tactic must be employed with caution. If you duck from a feint or duck tooearly, you leave yourself wide open for a punch or a kick. Your only defense isto weave and quickly escape from that position. While ducking, keep your eyesconstantly on your opponent and not on the floor. In photos A and B, Leepractices the tactic by swinging the heavy bag.Most of your side stepping should be to the left against an unorthodox orright-lead fighter because, after he misses, he is defenseless as you standbehind him. Sidestep to the right if he is an orthodox fighter.[images/9780897502504_118.jpg]But in jeet kune do, sometimes you are compelled to sidestep to the right toconfuse the opponent. Sidestepping to the right requires more skill in timingand in countering. Your timing and movement must be better calculated thansidestepping to the left. You also have to counter faster because the opponentstill faces you and is in position to deliver another attack.[images/9780897502504_119.jpg]In photos 1, 2 and 3, Lee avoids the side kick by sidestepping to his right.Notice that in photo 3, he uses his right hand to protect his body if he shouldever misjudge the blow. In photos 4 and 5, Lee is in perfect position to delivera kick to the groin area.Frequently, your opponent’s launched attack is so intense that he is notprepared to protect himself after a miss. Generally, he is vulnerable to anattack to the head and body. In photos A, B and C, the opponent lunges at Leewith a side kick. Lee quickly sidesteps to his right at the last moment to avoidthe kick. Then he counters, as in photos D and E, by employing a high hook kickto the opponent’s face.Precision of movement is essential in your footwork. Especially in sidesteppingto your right, you must move at the exact moment and let the blow just miss you.If you move too early, you will give the attacker time to change his tactic. Itis better to move late than too early, but do not move too late and be hit.Precision in movement means to move with balance. After avoiding the blow, youmust always be prepared to defend against another attack or be prepared tocounter. Precision can only be achieved by hours of training.While shifting your feet to secure the proper distance, use broken rhythm toconfuse your opponent as to your distance. Be in the on-guard position to movequickly and easily.When practicing offensive and defensive skills, you should always practice bycombining footwork with them. No matter how simple the hand or foot techniquesare, you should synchronize them while advancing and retreating. Eventually thistype of training will develop your natural perception of distance and ability tomove gracefully.[images/9780897502504_120.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_121.jpg]CHAPTER 7SKILL IN HAND TECHNIQUESSkill in punching doesn’t mean only delivering a strike and hitting your target.Accuracy, speed and powerful punches are also part of the technique of punching.Other elements include the position of your body when the punch is delivered,the path of your punch moving forward as well as returning, and the way yourpunch is thrown.The most used and the most important punch in jeet kune do is the leadingstraight punch. It is a fast punch because it travels only a short distance; itis an accurate punch because it goes straight forward. It is also thrown with aminimum effort and consequently does not disturb your balance.[images/9780897502504_122.jpg][images/9780897502504_123.jpg]JKD VS. CLASSICALThe leading straight punch is launched from an on-guard position, and thetrajectory of your punch should be a straight line in front of your nose, as inphotos 1, 2 and 3—using your nose as the guiding point.One of the big advantages of the JKD delivery is that you can throw a leadingstraight punch and still be well covered. Your body is protected, and you arealso in position to recover quickly from a miss.In comparison, the classical system initiates a punch from the hip and exposesthat section to an attack, as in photos A, B and C. When the punch is completed,it ends at one side of the body and the other portion of the body, especiallythe face, is exposed when the hand is withdrawn to the hip, as in photo C.[images/9780897502504_124.jpg]In photos 1 to 4, you will notice the difference in delivery between theclassical system (left) and the JKD system (right). In the JKD system, as inphoto 1, the hands protect the face and both the right and left sections of thebody evenly, while in the classical system, only the left side of the body isprotected. In photos 2 and 3, the JKD fighter has already delivered his punchcompletely, while the classical fighter is still in the process. Photo 4 showswhere the blow ends in both systems.In photo A, Lee (right) demonstrates from the on-guard position the shortdistance his punch has to travel compared to the classical stylist’s.Apparently, this is also why his punch reaches the target much more quickly.[images/9780897502504_125.jpg][images/9780897502504_126.jpg]Throwing your punch with your fist kept vertically instead of horizontally likethe classical system, as in photo 1, affords you extra reach, as in photos A andB. Lee’s punch in this bird’s-eye view, as in photo B, makes contact with hisopponent, but the opponent’s punch, even fully extended, falls short.The advantage of a JKD straight lead is that you can add three or more inches toyour reach. In jeet kune do, both the straight short lead, as in photo X, andthe long straight lead, as in photo Y, are used. The short is employed forclose-range fighting and the long for the middle distance. In photo X, Leeplaces his left hand on his right arm to indicate how much more extension he canadminister in the long straight, as in photo Y.[images/9780897502504_127.jpg]The rear or guarding hand should always be held high to protect your upper bodyfrom a counterattack. The rear hand does most of the guarding and is asupplement to the other hand. If one hand is punching, the other should bereturning to protect the body or immobilizing the opponent’s arm or arms againstcountering. It should always be there, correlating to the uncovered line orunprotected area. And it should also be in a tactical position for a follow-up.[images/9780897502504_128.jpg][images/9780897502504_129.jpg]PUNCHING STRAIGHTIn photos 1 to 5, Lee demonstrates from a bird’s-eye view how he throws acombination of a lead right, follows it up with a left and finishes it off witha right. Notice the synchronizing of his hands as well as the protection theyprovide. Whether you punch with your lead or rear hand, your punch should landat the same spot, using your nose as the guiding point.[images/9780897502504_130.jpg][images/9780897502504_131.jpg]Punching straight before your nose and keeping your rear hand up is definitelysuperior to the classical system, as illustrated by Lee in photos A to C. As thelead hand is thrust forward, the rear hand is always ready to block or parry anyblow to the body. It is also ready to counter. In photo A, the punch ispartially blocked, but this doesn’t stop it from penetrating and hitting theopponent’s face.[images/9780897502504_132.jpg][images/9780897502504_133.jpg]In this second illustration, as in photos 1, 2 and 3, when Lee’s lead punch isblocked, he throws a straight jab directly in front of his nose, which wards offthe opponent’s punch as it proceeds straight toward his opponent’s eye. Keepingthe “centerline” thrust has a great advantage when two punches are thrown in thesame path simultaneously against each other.[images/9780897502504_134.jpg]The position of your lead hand should allow you easy delivery and at the sametime maximum security. In photos A and B, the hand is placed to deflect theblows to the side, and in photo Y, the punch is diverted downward with thedefender hardly altering his hand.[images/9780897502504_135.jpg][images/9780897502504_136.jpg]As you have learned in chi sao, your elbow must maintain sturdiness, otherwiseyour defense may wither. Your elbow can move from side to side but must notcollapse toward your body from a blow. After shooting out a punch, do not dropyour hand when withdrawing it to the on-guard position. The punch should alwaysbe returned on the same plane or path it was delivered, as in photos 1, 2 and 3,so you are ready for any counter.[images/9780897502504_137.jpg]BAD HABITSAlthough you often see a good fighter with a bad habit, he usually gets awaywith it because of his superior speed and his good judgment in timing anddistance. In photos A, B and C, Lee snaps back from a straight punch andcounters with his left as the opponent creates an opening for Lee when he dropshis hand in the withdrawal.[images/9780897502504_138.jpg][images/9780897502504_139.jpg]In another illustration, Lee converts a block by his opponent into a backfistpunch when the opponent retracts his hand to throw another punch, as in photos1, 2 and 3. If the opponent uses his left hand to immobilize Lee’s right hand,as in photo 1, and throws a body punch with the other hand, he can keep Lee onthe defensive. But the classical way of withdrawing his hand to his hip hasgiven Lee the chance to convert a block into an offensive weapon, as in photo 2.The opponent’s second punch is easily stopped by Lee’s rear hand, as in photo 3.Another bad habit some fighters develop is dropping their rear hand in themiddle of exchanging blows, as in photos X and Y. In photo X, Lee takesadvantage of such an opponent by slipping a punch and countering with a fingerjab to his throat.You can also take advantage of an opponent who lacks quick decision. He intendsto throw his lead punch but after extending it halfway, he withdraws his hand tothe on-guard position. During his indecisive moment, you can take advantage ofhis action by shooting a straight thrust, especially if he has already taken astep forward.Then there is the fighter who continually engages and then disengageshaphazardly. He will engage or make contact with your hand and, instead ofkeeping it there, lower or drift it to the opposite line, creating an openingfor a quick, straight thrust.In heavy punching, your arm becomes a weapon with your wrist, making it onesolid piece like a club. The forearm is the handle and the fist is the knot, asin photo A. The fist is aligned with the forearm and does not bend at the wrist.At the completion of the punch, your clenched thumb should be up. Your fistpropels without a twist, and the knuckles point at the direction of your bodymovement.When punching with the lead hand, constantly vary the position of your head toprotect it from a counter. Keep your opponent guessing. In your forwardmovement, your head remains straight during the first few inches, but later yourhead alters according to the situation.[images/9780897502504_140.jpg]Another tactic is to feint before leading to lessen any count-ering blow. Butkeep everything simple; do not overplay the feinting or head motion. Frequently,you can surprise your opponent with a double-lead because the second punch maydisrupt his timing and lead the way for a follow-up.Sometimes a fighter attempts to put too much weight or “body” into his punch,and consequently, the blow becomes a push-punch, which lacks a powerful impactforce. To be effective, the punch should always be delivered with your arms andshoulders loose. Your fist only tightens immediately before impact. Punchesshould never be thrown from a windup motion.Some fighters have a good stance, but as soon as they are ready to attack, theyleave themselves wide open, as in photo Y. They develop this bad habit with abad training attitude, as in photo Z. When practicing with the heavy bag, alwaysmaintain good form, as in photo 1. Have your partner pay close attention to yourfaults.[images/9780897502504_141.jpg]Some martial artists practice their art in slow motion. They move their handsand feet as slow as a snail. But they claim that when the time comes, they canward off any attack quickly and effectively, even without speed training.Lee used to emphasize that to be fast you have to practice fast movements. “Idon’t know any sprinter in the world who can break the record only by joggingdaily around the track,” he said.[images/9780897502504_142.jpg][images/9780897502504_143.jpg]TRAPPING AND GRABBINGMuscles do not act by themselves without guidance. It is the nervous system thatguides them to perform. A well-executed movement is the consequence of dailytraining for skill by developing proper coordination of the nervous system withthe muscles. These muscles contract at the exact fraction of a second with theprecise degree of intensity or looseness, depending on the command of thenervous system.The coordination or connection between the nervous system and the musclesimproves with each performance. Each effort not only strengthens the skill butalso paves the way for the succeeding acts to become easier, more definite andmore exact. But absence from performance deteriorates the connection and affectsthe execution of the movement.From the chi sao (sticking hands) exercise, as in photos A and B, thepractitioners of wing chun advance to trapping hand (phon sao) or grabbing hand(lop sao) techniques. In photo 1, as Lee rotates his hand routinely in chi sao,he feels his partner’s energy being disrupted and flowing sporadically. At thatinstant when there is a gap, Lee makes his move by overlapping his left handover both of the partner’s hands, as in photo 2. Then, as soon as he immobilizesor traps (phon sao) them, he throws a straight punch to his partner’s face, asin photo 3.The chi sao exercise is an important part of jeet kune do borrowed from wingchun kung fu. First, it develops sensitivity and pliability in your hands, whichare so valuable in close hand-to-hand combat. You can really frustrate youropponent—who doesn’t have that skill—because every move can be easily thwartedonce you have developed this sensitivity. For more discussion on chi sao, go topages 38 and 70.[images/9780897502504_144.jpg][images/9780897502504_145.jpg]In photos 1, 2 and 3, Lee demonstrates the technique of grabbing (lop sao) fromthe chi sao exercise. In photo 1, Lee purposely exaggerates his rotation tonarrow the space between his hands. When his hands are at the nearest positionto each other, he grabs his partner’s left arm with his left hand. During thatinstant, his arms cross each other, as in photo 2. Then Lee jerks his partner’sarm toward himself and simultaneously delivers a backfist punch to his face, asin photo 3. To learn more on the technique of grabbing and trapping, read WingChun Kung-Fu by J. Yimm Lee. Lee simplified his chi sao a lot in later years. Hewould control the center of his opponent’s energy and would not disengage to hitor trap. He would just attack from the inside. If his opponent disengaged, hewould attack inside.From close-quarters fighting, students are taught to move farther apart andcontinue to apply the hand techniques. In photos A, B and C, Lee’s opponentattempts a finger jab utilizing the “centerline” thrust. He first attempts topush Lee’s hand aside to create an opening, as in photo A. Second, he tries topenetrate Lee’s defense with a finger jab, but Lee’s flowing energy is toopowerful to oppose, as in photo B. In photo C, the situation completely turnsaround as Lee takes the offensive.[images/9780897502504_146.jpg][images/9780897502504_147.jpg]Although Lee always takes the stance of jeet kune do’s on-guard position, as inphoto Y, he purposely stands in the modified wing chun stance, as in photo A,for the sake of illustrating the evolution of wing chun techniques in jeet kunedo. With his body leaning a little backward, he sinks his hips toward the floor.Unlike a wing chun stylist, who faces his opponent squarely, Lee adopts theright lead stance.As the opponent drives his lead punch toward his face, as in photo B, Lee, withquick reaction and anticipation, retaliates with a finger jab. By utilizing thecenterline principle, Lee’s thrust penetrates straight to the opponent’s eye andsimultaneously wards off his blow, as in photo C.In the previous technique, Lee’s opponent fails to deliver the inner-gate punchbut Lee is successful. The reason is that this technique is not only dependenton execution but also on the intensity of your flowing energy.In photos A, A1 and A2, the opponent engages Lee’s right lead, but Lee quicklyreleases it with a small, counterclockwise motion, as in photo A1. Then hepivots his hips to his left as he simultaneously throws a right punch into hisopponent’s face, as in photo A2.Against an opponent who hits and attempts to press his guard down, Lee uses theroll-and-trap maneuver, as in photos D to D2 and photos D to F (see page 160).In photo E, the opponent uses his forearm to hit and press Lee’s right lead handdownward. Lee keeps his rear hand high for security and quickly rolls his arm todisengage, as in photo F. He continues to flow his energy and retain theimmovable elbow position as he switches his weight to the front foot. Then hequickly traps the opponent’s leading hand with his rear hand, as in photo D1.Once the opponent’s hand is immobilized, as in photo D2, Lee quickly delivers abackfist punch.[images/9780897502504_148.jpg][images/9780897502504_149.jpg][images/9780897502504_150.jpg][images/9780897502504_151.jpg]In photos G to G2 and G to I (see page 161), Lee illustrates a defensivemaneuver of receiving a blow and then pursuing or countering it when the hand isbeing withdrawn. For instance, when the opponent delivers a punch to his body,Lee steps back slightly and rides the opponent’s punch with his lead hand,preventing him from penetrating, as in photos H and I.When the opponent withdraws his hand to throw another punch, as in photo G1, Leequickly counters with a jab, as in photo G2, using his rear hand to stop thesecond punch.Blinking is a natural response when an object is hurled toward your eyes. But insparring or fighting, this reaction must be controlled or it will affect yourdefense as well as your counterattack. The instant your eyes are closed, youcannot react quickly enough to counter because you may not know where yourelusive opponent is. Second, your adversary can take advantage of yourshortcoming by feinting an attack. He can fake a punch, and as you blink, he canlaunch his blow while your eyes are shut.While training in any type of fighting, it is important that you do not developbad habits that may cause injury to yourself. One of the most common faults of abeginner is that he has a tendency to open his mouth while in the midst ofexchanging blows. It may be a habit he has acquired before studying martialarts, or he may have to breathe through his mouth because he is out of shape.[images/9780897502504_152.jpg]When your mouth is open, it can easily be broken by a direct hit, as in photo A.Another dangerous trait is to stick your tongue out, as in photo B. Learn toclose your mouth in sparring or fighting by clenching your teeth firmlytogether. In sparring sessions, bite on your rubber mouthpiece to prevent itfrom flying out, even after a hard hit.Protect your hands and wrists by punching correctly. Punch with your fist byhaving your fingers tightly clenched and your thumb wrapped snugly over them soyou can’t break it. Because the knuckles are the hardest part of your fist, thisis the area that should make the contact, not your fingers.Prevent any chance of spraining your wrist by keeping it aligned and firm whenpunching. Learn to hit straight by practicing on a makiwara (padded strikingpost), canvas bag or heavy bag."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_153.jpg]CHAPTER 8SKILL IN KICKINGAlthough the hands are considered the most important tools, the feet can be avital and integral part in your overall strategy in fighting. For instance,against a clever boxer, it is an advantage for you to use your feet all or mostof the time. A boxer, who doesn’t know any defense against a kick, isvulnerable, especially at the low-line area around the groin and knee.The strategy is to use your feet and stay away from his fists. This is possiblebecause the leg is longer than the arm. Besides, a proper delivery of a kick isusually more powerful than a punch.In jeet kune do, the first line of attack or defense is the side kick to theshin or knee because those targets are closest to you and because they areexposed and difficult to protect. Furthermore, you are at a secure distance indelivering the kick, which can cripple your adversary with one blow. Bruce Leeused to apply this low kick like a jab. His kick was so quick that he coulddeliver multiple blows in a second.To do the low side kick from an on-guard position, as in photo 1, slide yourright or lead foot forward about three or four inches while you immediatelybring your rear foot forward, just behind the lead foot. Then simultaneouslylift your lead foot, as in photo 2, and deliver a low side kick by thrustingyour foot obliquely and twisting your hips strongly, as in photos 3 and 4. Learnto keep your body away from your opponent’s reach by leaning away from him andnot upright, as in photo A.[images/9780897502504_154.jpg][images/9780897502504_155.jpg][images/9780897502504_156.jpg]LEADING SIDE KICK TO HIGH KICKThe leading side kick is the most powerful kick in jeet kune do. One good kickis usually sufficient to knock your opponent off his feet. Although this is oneof the most popular kicks, it should be employed with caution because it can beblocked or your leg can be seized if the kick is not delivered properly and atthe right moment. But because of its tremendous force, sometimes it willpenetrate a block, or the block is not effective enough to keep the blow fromscoring or maiming. The side kick is not fast or as deceiving as some of theother kicks, but it can be used cleverly when preceded by a feint. A good feintwith your hands should open the defense for a quick side kick to the head orbody.The leading side kick can be used in a defensive tactic, too. For instance, asyour opponent makes his move to attack, you “cut-off” or “stop-kick,”intercepting his movement with a quick side kick to his body before his blowreaches you.The best equipment on which to practice your side kick is the heavy 70-poundbag, as in photos A and B. The bag is durable enough to take any punishing blowand is heavy enough to give you a feeling of hitting a person. When contact ismade, it emits a sound to let you know whether the contact was solid or “pushy.”[images/9780897502504_157.jpg]Sometimes it is a good idea just to keep side-kicking the heavy bag as it swaysback and forth. After a solid kick, wait for the bag to swing back, then timeyourself with a leap and another side kick. Keep doing this for a good workoutwith your feet. Be careful that you don’t miss the bag or fail to hit itsquarely because you are liable to hurt your knee after a strong thrust.Another good drill is having someone stand behind the bag. After a solid sidekick, instruct him to move a step back and hold the bag in a slanting positionso you can deliver another kick without stopping your motion. To do the secondkick, you must plant your foot down immediately after the initial kick anddeliver another side kick without the three-inch slide. In other words, thesecond kick is like the first without the slide.To do the high or medium-level side kick, stand at the on-guard position. Slideyour lead foot three or four inches, as in photo 1. Then do the quick advance orthe forward burst, as in photo 2, depending on the space between you and theopponent. Just when your rear foot is being planted, your lead foot should bedelivering the kick, as in photos 3 and 4. The power in the kick comes from thesudden twist of the hips before impact and from the snapping of your foot afterkicking through.[images/9780897502504_158.jpg]The side kick must be delivered with one fluid motion, as in photos A to D. Froman on-guard position, Lee fakes a punch to the opponent’s face, as in photos Aand B, luring the opponent to raise his hands, which leaves a gap in hismidsection area. Then Lee quickly follows up with a side kick, as in photos Cand D.[images/9780897502504_159.jpg][images/9780897502504_160.jpg]Other important apparatuses, which Bruce Lee utilized constantly, are the heavyshield and the air bag. The air bag is good as a stationary target, but theheavy shield is good for both stationary and moving targets.[images/9780897502504_161.jpg][images/9780897502504_162.jpg]Although the heavy shield cannot cushion the shock of the impact to the holderlike the air bag, the holder can nullify some of the shock by moving backward.Because the heavy shield allows mobility on the part of the holder, the kickercan unleash his most powerful kick without hurting the other person.In photo 1, Lee prepares to attack from the on-guard position. The holder of theheavy shield begins to move backward as he sees the attack unfolding, as inphoto 2. But he is not quick enough and Lee releases a side kick, as in photos 3and 4. The kick almost drives the holder off his feet, as in photo 5. This typeof training develops a sense of distance and improves the timing of bothindividuals. The air bag is not appropriate as a moving target because of itslimited hitting space.To kick high, have someone hold a long staff at your waist level. Stand aboutfive feet away and raise your right foot as high as possible with your leg bentand slanted. This can be accomplished by lifting your knee as high as possible.Lean your body backward so your head inclines toward your right. Then skip onyour left foot toward the staff until your right foot passes over it.The purpose of this training is not to kick but to learn to lift your foot ashigh as possible. Keep increasing the height of the staff until your foot can’tpass over it anymore. Then do the same exercise, minus the staff, and kick intothe air. To kick much higher, for instance, like over your head, you have toconcentrate heavily on flexibility exercises.In your daily practice, include the “rapid-fire” side-kick drill. Stand withyour feet parallel, place your weight on your left foot, lean backward andexecute a right side kick to your right. Then quickly position your right footat the same spot after snapping it out. But just before you plant it, your leftfoot should be in motion for a left side kick to your left. As your left foot isbeing retrieved, immediately do another right side kick and keep repeating thekicks from one foot to the other as fast as you can. At the outset, you willfeel awkward and off-balance, but continue to practice this difficult exercisedaily for several minutes until you can do it fluently and in balance.HOOK KICKOne of the most utilized kicks in jeet kune do is the hook kick. It is not apowerful kick, but it is swift and deceptive. It is not a forceful kick, but itcan be damaging. The big advantage the hook kick has over the side kick is thatit can be launched in many instances before your opponent can prepare for it. Itis also a safer kick because you can recover quickly after delivery. It isemployed at a closer distance than the side kick but employed at a fartherdistance in the hand-to-hand fighting range.To do the hook kick, slide your lead foot three or four inches forward from theon-guard position, as in photo 1. Then do the forward shuffle or the quickadvance. As soon as your rear foot is about to land, deliver your side kick, asin photo 2. The kick should be concluded with a snap and your body should beleaning back, as in photos 3 and 4, and not forward.Although the hook kick is used mostly for the upper line—above thewaist—sometimes it can be used to attack the thigh or groin area, as in photo A.But this depends on the position of your opponent in relation to yours. Heshould be standing extremely to your right if you’re in a right stance to hithis groin area. The hook kick to the thigh area is hardly ever used because itisn’t too effective. The distance your foot has to travel is too short togenerate enough power.[images/9780897502504_163.jpg][images/9780897502504_164.jpg][images/9780897502504_165.jpg]SPIN KICKThe spin kick is used mostly as a counterattacking maneuver. It is veryeffective against an aggressive opponent who keeps attacking in a straight linebut is not lunging at you. It is dangerous to use the spin kick against adefensive or counterattacking opponent who constantly waits for your move beforeretaliating. Against such an opponent, you are vulnerable just before you canshoot out your kick, when your back is turned to him.The spin kick is a little more difficult to execute because you must rotate yourbody, and in the process, your back will be facing the target for an instant. Atthat point, you can easily misjudge the position of the target. Frankly, ittakes several hours of practice before you can even hit the target squarely.The spin kick is not a sweeping kick, as used by some martial artists, butsimilar to a back thrust kick. This is one of the few kick techniques in jeetkune do that employs the rear foot.The best equipment for practicing the spin kick is the heavy bag. Stand about aleg-length from the bag in the on-guard position, as in photo 1. Concentrate onthe spot on the bag you wish to hit so that, while your body is rotating like aswivel, as in photo 2, you can still picture the spot in your mind.[images/9780897502504_166.jpg]The pivot should be done on the ball of your right foot with your head slightlyahead of your lower body so you have a glimpse of the target before you thrustyour foot out, as in photo 3. Your body should be aligned with the bag when youdeliver the kick. Like the side kick, you should “whip” your hips in at the timeof contact and snap your foot, as in photo 4. It is very difficult to maintainyour balance after the kick because your body is rotating and because you mustthrust your foot at the same time.The spin kick is a surprise countering tactic. Even against a veteran fighterwho has good defense, the spin kick is often the only kick that can catch himoff his guard. Because it takes so much practice to perfect this kick, learn tokick into the air as often as you can.[images/9780897502504_167.jpg]In the beginning, learn to do the technique slowly by standing in the on-guardposition, as in photo 1. Then rotate your body on the ball of your slightly bentfoot, as in photo 2. Keep your other leg bent and ready to thrust. Be sure thatthe lifted foot does not swing haphazardly in the pivot or it will throw youoff-balance. Besides, you can’t kick effectively with an outstretched foot.Finally, thrust your foot with force when your body has made almost a complete180-degree rotation, as in photos 3 and 3A.OTHER KICKSThe sweep or the reverse hook kick is not often used in jeet kune do because itlacks power. It is used strictly as a high kick to the face. The kick isemployed mostly as a surprise tactic, especially against someone who attackswith his leading foot extended. A front or hook kick will not work because thepath of your foot will be hampered by the extended foot. But a sweep will workeasily because it will avoid the obstructive foot.To do the sweep kick, you have to have flexible legs. From the on-guardposition, as in photo 1, slide your lead foot about three or four inches forwardand then do the quick advance as you initiate your kick, as in photo 2. If youare in the right lead stance, your foot will travel from your left to your right(clockwise motion) in a narrow arc, as in photos 3 and 3A.[images/9780897502504_168.jpg][images/9780897502504_169.jpg]This kick is a scraping-type of kick and will not knock your opponent down. Ifdone with your shoes on, it can cause damage by scratching your opponent’s face.To practice this kick on a heavy bag from a right lead position, stand slightlytoward your left and hit the bag with one motion. The path of the foot should bealmost vertical, except for a small arc at the peak. The point of contact is theheel and outside blade of your right foot.The latest kick that Bruce Lee developed for jeet kune do was the inside kick.This kick is applied at the low line, especially to the groin and inside thighareas. The point of contact is your instep.The kick, which is as fast as the front and hook kicks, is used against someonewhose stance is the opposite of yours. For instance, if you are in the rightlead stance and your opponent is in the left lead stance, you cannot hit hisgroin area with most kicks because his left leg protects it. But an insidekick—which is delivered like a front kick, except that it is not deliveredvertically—can reach that area if you are standing slightly toward your left,angular to your opponent.Unlike a front kick, the inside kick is delivered in an upward slant, oppositeof the hook kick. But like the front kick, power can be created by jerking yourhips forward just before contact. It is a difficult kick with which to generatepower because you must have perfect synchronization between your hips anddelivery of the kick.The only other kick that is sometimes used is the front kick, which wasdiscussed in Chapters 4 [9780897502504_epub_c04_r1.htm] and 5[9780897502504_epub_c05_r1.htm].[images/9780897502504_170.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_171.jpg]CHAPTER 9PARRYINGParrying is a defensive tactic that can easily be learned and applied. It is aquick motion with your closed or open hand, either from the inside or theoutside, to ward off blows directed at you. It is just a light slap to theopponent’s hand with hardly any force—just enough to deflect the blow away fromyour body.The technique should be done with your elbow almost at a fixed position whilethe movement comes from your hand and arm. It should not be an extreme reactionsuch as a slashing or whipping motion. Any excessive movement of your hand willexpose your body to a counterattack. In other words, you should move your handjust enough to protect and control the blow.Timing in this technique is more important than force. If you react too early,your opponent can either change the path of his kick or punch. Or you may leaveopenings for a counter by parrying late, waiting until the last moment, and onlyacting when the blow is near you.Against a quick, penetrating opponent or against someone with superior heightand reach, you may have to take a step backward while parrying. The parry shouldbe made simultaneously with your back foot in motion and not after it isplanted, nor should the parry be made prior to your body movement.Learn to parry only against a real attack. But if you intuitively start to parryagainst a feint or false attack, your motion should be controlled so that yourhand or arm hardly reacts.Train yourself to detect a real and false attack by having someone directvarious kicks and punches at you. After a considerable amount of practice, youwill only parry at the real attacks and not react to the feints or fakes.Generally, a parry is a good and safe defensive measure, but a skilled fightermay beat your parry. If he does, then you must move backward while parrying.INSIDE HIGH PARRYThe inside high parry is generally utilized because most attacks are punchesdirected to the face. In comparing the classical style with jeet kune do, as inphoto A, it is discernible that the JKD way of parrying provides more protectionand more speed on the upper line. In photo B, it reveals that a punch can bedelivered almost simultaneously with the parry in jeet kune do. But this is nottrue with the other style, which uses a block and a punch; it is definitely aslower counter because of its two distinct motions.[images/9780897502504_172.jpg][images/9780897502504_173.jpg]Bruce Lee uses a long staff to practice the inside high parry, as in photos Aand B. A partner thrusts the staff directly to Lee’s face. Lee slips the thrustby shifting his weight to the lead foot and bending the front knee slightly. Atthe same time, he uses his left hand to parry the staff lightly. This type oftraining is valuable because your partner can spot any discrepancy in yourbalance and motion. Against any heavy blow such as a kick, use your parry with aclenched fist, as in photo C.To defend against a swing, Lee, standing in the on-guard position, as in photo1, prepares for the attack. As soon as his opponent initiates his swing, Leealready has his right hand in motion, as in photo 2. By the time he parries thepunch, Lee’s right punch is upon the opponent’s face, as in photo 3. In photo Z,he uses the same parry against a straight right punch.[images/9780897502504_174.jpg][images/9780897502504_175.jpg]The inside high parry is done with a slight, counterclockwise twist of yourwrist, as your hand meets the blow. This slight motion is capable of protectingyour body because the twist of your wrist is away from your body and toward theoncoming blow. Your arm is stronger when it is directed away from your bodyrather than toward it. The classical style uses the opposite motion. The twistis clockwise toward the body.INSIDE LOW PARRYThe inside low parry is used against a punch or kick in the low-line area. Froma right-lead on-guard position, the parry is made with a semicircular,clockwise, downward motion, as in photo 1. Simultaneously, your weight isshifted to the front leg as you bend your knee slightly. Almost at the sametime, you counter with your right hand, as in photo 2.[images/9780897502504_176.jpg]In the classical system, your blocking hand moves downward in an obliquedirection, as in photo A, as your other hand retracts toward your hip, as inphoto B. The disadvantage in the classical style is that your countering is muchslower because you have to block, while retracting your other hand, and thendeliver your punch; these are two definite motions while there is just one fluidmotion of both hands in jeet kune do. Another disadvantage is that your body,especially the upper line, is continuously exposed.[images/9780897502504_177.jpg][images/9780897502504_178.jpg]In the above photos, Lee illustrates the application of the inside low parry. Inphoto 1, Lee stands in the on-guard position, keeping his eyes glued on theopponent. As soon as the opponent begins to attack, Lee already responds to hisaction, as in photo 2.The opponent throws a right that is intercepted by Lee’s inside low parry, as inphoto 3. Lee then converts the parry to a lop sao or grabbing technique. In onealmost smooth motion, he pulls his opponent toward him and shifts his bodyforward to deliver a straight lead to the face.OUTSIDE HIGH PARRYThe outside high parry is more of a slapping stroke than the inside high parry,which is more of a warding-off motion. This parry is used to divert the blow onthe opposite side of your body, so your hand has to cross over, as in photo A.There is no loss in the counterpunch’s quickness because your lead hand canstill deliver the punch almost at the same time as you are parrying. Byutilizing the guard or rear hand for parrying, the lead hand, which is closer toyour opponent and is the stronger hand, is free to punch, as in photo B.[images/9780897502504_179.jpg]The classical system uses the same block for both the outside and inside highattack by just reversing the function of the hands. Instead of the left doingthe block, the right does the blocking, and the left or the weaker hand does thepunching, as in photo Y.Bruce Lee explains in the following series of photos how he utilizes his outsidehigh parry for defense against a “head” shot. In photo 1, Lee waits for hisopponent’s first move. In photo 2, as the opponent throws a right, Lee parriesthe blow with a light slap—just enough to divert the path of the blow from hisface. Simultaneously, he takes a three or four inch slide forward with his leadfoot, bending his knee so the weight is placed on it.Trapping the opponent’s parried hand, he delivers his own right, as in photos 3and 3A (side view). If Lee were to block or slap the blow vigorously, he wouldnot be able to trap the opponent’s hand to his shoulder.[images/9780897502504_180.jpg][images/9780897502504_181.jpg]In the next illustration, Lee stands in the on-guard position preparing for theattack, as in photo 1. As the opponent initiates the attack, as in photo 2, Leemeets the left swing with a parry and counters by clawing the opponent’s face,as in photo 3. Lee must time his forward movement and parry correctly to protecthimself. In photo 4, Lee switches his hands smoothly so that he has time todeliver another blow—this time a backfist punch.In the last illustration of the outside high parry, Lee uses the parry with acountering front kick. From the on-guard position, as in photos A and B, Leeparries a straight right. Without taking any step, he delivers a front kick tothe opponent’s groin almost at the same time, as in photo C. This is a saferparry than the preceding illustrations because he doesn’t have to move in toreach his opponent because the leg is much longer than the arm.[images/9780897502504_182.jpg][images/9780897502504_183.jpg]When Lee can’t find a partner, he practices alone on the wooden dummy. In thenext three photos, Lee practices his parrying technique. In photo 1, he parrieswith his left hand and uses his right for countering. In photo 2, Lee’s parryinghand crosses underneath his punching hand. In photo 3, Lee parries with his lefthand and simultaneously releases a front kick.The outside low parry against punches is performed almost similarly to theinside low parry except, in the former, the hand crosses over the body. Theguard hand is used to protect the other side of the body against any low blow,as in photo A. Hence, the outside low parry has a greater circular motion thanthe inside low parry. Just like the inside low parry, its purpose is to deflectthe oncoming blow downward.JKD VS. CLASSICALThe classical system uses the same blocking technique for all low-line blows.The hands just reverse their roles, as in photo B. The right hand is now usedfor blocking, and the left is used for attacking. Like the other blockingtechniques, there are two distinct motions instead of one fluid, continuousmotion, as in jeet kune do.[images/9780897502504_184.jpg][images/9780897502504_185.jpg]In the next series of photographs, two classical fighters confront each other,as in photo 1. Standing in the orthodox stance, the fighter on the left throws ahigh punch, which is blocked by his opponent, as in photo 2. The opponentfollows up with a right punch that the fighter on the left blocks, as in photo3, and counters with a straight right to the opponent’s solar plexus, as inphoto 4.The same technique is now presented against an unorthodox (southpaw) opponent,using the JKD stance. Lee stands in the on-guard position, as in photo A, and ashis opponent starts to attack, as in photo B, Lee readies to parry the blow witha slapping motion. In photo C, it shows the result of Lee’s parry and hiscountering to the opponent’s face.[images/9780897502504_186.jpg][images/9780897502504_187.jpg]Against an opponent who stands with his left lead (orthodox) forward, as inphoto A, Lee quickly stops the thrust with a short shuffle backward and parriesit as the opponent steps forward with a straight right. Lee’s parry converts totrapping the opponent’s hand just before he counters with a right to Lee’s face,as in photo B.The outside low parry is usually used against a kick that is directed below yourchest with either a closed fist or an open hand.The JKD and the classical parries seem similar, as in photos X and Y, but theydiffer in delivery. The JKD parry is executed with a semicircular, downwardmotion to deflect or control a kick. In the classical style, the block isperformed with a downward, slanting, forceful motion to stop the kick in itspath.[images/9780897502504_188.jpg][images/9780897502504_189.jpg]In the next series of photos, Lee illustrates how he defends against a lungingside kick. From the on-guard position, Lee readies for an attack, as in photo 1.As the opponent lunges forward to launch his kick, Lee synchronizes his backwardmovement with the opponent’s, as in photo 2. He also retreats just far enough toavoid the blow but stays close enough to ward off the kick, as in photo 3. Leetakes advantage of the situation by turning his opponent completely around sothe opponent’s back faces him. Lee then quickly employs a front kick to thegroin, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_190.jpg]Against someone who is in a stance opposite of Lee’s, as in photo 1, Lee movesbackward with perfect timing to the attack. Lee has more time in this attack ashis opponent uses his rear foot (the farthest foot) to deliver a front kick. Leejust moves a little backward in this attack because the penetration is not thatdeep, as in photo 2.Lee parries the kick and prepares to defend against the next blow, as in photo3. This time, he uses the inside low parry against the right punch, trapping hisopponent’s hand. Then he counters with his own straight right punch, as in photo4.Lee constructed his wooden dummy with an extra arm in the center of thestructure strictly to practice his low-line parry, as in photo A.[images/9780897502504_191.jpg][images/9780897502504_192.jpg]PARRYING VS. BLOCKINGTo parry is merely to close the line or deflect the opponent’s hand; it shouldnot swing too far to the right or left but just enough to create advantageousopenings necessary to counterfight.Vary your parries to confuse the opponent. Don’t let him set an attacking plan.Instead, keep him guessing. This will create hesitation on his part in launchinghis offensive maneuvers.When there are a multitude of parries to be made, each parry must be completed,and your hand should be at the appropriate position before the next parry ismade.When there is a compound attack, the first parry is performed while moving yourrear foot, and the second would be done in exactly the same time as you areshuffling backward from the second attack. Your rear foot must move before theattack and not after the delivery of the blow.Parrying is more subtle than blocking, which is a more violent force, because itis used frequently to abuse the opponent’s limbs. Blocking should be usedinfrequently and only when necessary because it can drain your energy. Besides,even if you block a well-delivered blow, it will still disturb your balance andcreate openings for your opponent. In the meantime, it prevents you fromcountering."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_193.jpg]CHAPTER 10TARGETSPRIMARY TARGETSThe two primary targets in fighting are the eyes and the groin, as in photo Abelow. A solid groin blow can quickly incapacitate or even cause death to a manno matter how physically powerful he is. Even a light blow can render a manunconscious.[images/9780897502504_194.jpg]Some martial arts call such a vicious blow too cruel and inhumane. But Bruce Leealways felt that your main purpose in learning the martial arts or self-defensearts is self-protection or self-preservation.“The meaning of ‘martial’ is ‘warlike,’” he used to say. “We are not in a game;it’s your life or his. And since you only have one life, take care of it thebest you can.”“When you treat the martial arts like a sport,” he said, “then you haveestablished rules, which create weaknesses. Or when you attempt to be too civil,then you learn to resist for fear of hurting your adversary, and this can alsoweaken your defensive technique.”Many fighting arts, which became sports, establish rules that forbid certaindangerous techniques to the players. Consequently, most rules banned attackingthe groin area and, as time went by, emphasis on guarding the groin arealessened to almost nothing. This is true in boxing, wrestling, judo and manystyles of karate. Because of the artificial protection today, many fighters donot know how to protect themselves from a kick to the groin, as in photo X. Eventheir stances are vulnerable to a fast frontal kick.[images/9780897502504_195.jpg]Lee saw this flaw and created his own stance, as in photo Y. In this stance, thegroin area is well-protected by the lead thigh and by his adaptation of theshuffling footwork. It did not curtail his speed or freedom of footwork.Another feature of jeet kune do is that the rear foot is rarely used for kickingexcept in a spin kick. The reason is that at that moment when the rear footcrosses the front, your groin area is exposed, especially with a roundhousekick.Finger-jabbing to the eyes (a primary target), as in photo 1, is also consideredthe first line in hand techniques for attacking and defending, while the shinkick and knee kick is the first line in kick techniques. Eyes are a primarytarget because once blinded, you are almost helpless to defend yourself. It isreferred to as the first line of offense or defense because finger-jabbingallows you an additional three or four inches in reach over a punch.[images/9780897502504_196.jpg][images/9780897502504_197.jpg][images/9780897502504_198.jpg]VITAL SPOTSBesides the primary targets, there are other vital spots in the human body, asin photos 1 and 2. The knee or shin kick is the first line of attack or defensebecause the leg allows you the longest reach, and the knee or shin generally arethe targets closest to you.[images/9780897502504_199.jpg]The blow to the lead leg can be a side kick to the knee or shin, as in photo A,a side kick to the ankle, as in photo B, or to the thigh, as in photo C. Thekick to the lead leg is a fairly safe kick if delivered correctly, as in photo1.The upper-line areas are harder to hit because they are usually better andeasier for your opponent to guard. To hit the throat of a skilled fighter isalmost impossible because his hands are always guarding it and because he tuckshis chin to his shoulder, hardly allowing any opening. Sometimes a finger jabcan penetrate it, as in photo X.The rib cage is very vulnerable, especially if a blow is administered when thehand is held high. In such a position, the ribs are separated considerably and,as a result, are quite fragile to any kind of a sharp blow.The solar plexus is one of the most vulnerable spots on your body, but it ishard to hit. It is a tiny spot, and most fighters have their hands there all thetime. A good hit there usually discourages one from continuing to fight, but itis a rare occasion when a skilled fighter can be hit at that spot.[images/9780897502504_200.jpg]The jaw is a larger target than the throat, but it is an elusive target againsta skilled fighter who can weave and duck. A fighter with good footwork can moveaway or just move his head away from the blow. By tucking his chin to hisshoulder and by raising his shoulder to meet it, it becomes an inaccessibletarget to hit. Nevertheless, a hit to the jaw can be devastating, as in photo Z.There are more boxers knocked out from a hit to the jaw than to any other place.Besides, if a blow is delivered at a certain angle, as in photo Y, the jaw caneasily be broken.The science of fighting is not just to hit your opponent’s body but to hit himat the most vulnerable spot. Better to finish a fight with one punch than withseveral.[images/9780897502504_201.jpg][images/9780897502504_202.jpg][images/9780897502504_203.jpg]CORRECT USE OF ARSENALSYou also have to learn to hit without injuring yourself. Your fist must beformed properly or you can injure your thumb, fingers or your wrist. If youpunch or kick correctly, you will not hurt yourself even if you miss your targetand hit a harder substance.In delivering a side kick, use the edge or flat of your foot to make contactwith the target, as in photo A. Occasionally, you may be able to use your heel,as in photo B. If you are wearing shoes, the point of contact for a front kickcan be the toe, as in photo C, the ball of your foot, as in photo D, or yourinstep, as in photo E. But if you are barefoot, avoid using your toes, and usecaution when using the ball of your foot. The safest part to use is your instep.Sometimes the inside portion of your foot is employed, as in photo 1, but it’susually used for sweeps.The strategy of fighting depends on the vulnerable spots that you must protectas well as the areas most easily within reach of your opponent."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_204.jpg]CHAPTER 11SPARRINGContact sparring is the closest endeavor to real fighting. Unlike real fighting,there are limitations such as wearing protective gear and gloves as well asrestrictions in the use of certain offensive techniques. Until man inventsbetter equipment and methods, this is the most practical way to train today.Bruce Lee always emphasized the importance of sparring. “A fighter who trainswithout sparring is like a swimmer who hasn’t immersed in the water,” he used tosay.There are shortcomings in modern fighting sports. In Western boxing, theparticipants have the inclination to become reckless because of the protectiverules in the sport. They are restrained from using certain punches, prohibitedfrom hitting below the belt and are not allowed to use their feet to kick.Those who participate in Oriental martial arts tournaments, such as karate, arebeing overprotected by the noncontact practice of stopping the blows severalinches from the body even though the full body is the target. This practicehurts the participants’ ability to judge distance. Besides, this artificialshelter keeps practitioners from learning to slip, duck, weave and use the otherdefensive tactics found in boxing.In real or total fighting, all the elements must be employed to be effective.You must use distance as a protective maneuver and all the evasive techniques ofclose fighting.The science of fighting is the ability of one to outsmart and outmaneuver hisopponent—to hit him without getting hit. In fighting, a good offense is the bestdefense, as in many other sports. A good fighter should beat his opponent to thepunch with lightning-fast leads or outkick him with his quick lead foot. Heattacks with deception. He creates openings for himself by his command oftechniques that lead his opponent into a quandary. He must deliver proper kicksand punches instinctively so his mind is free for strategy.Although sparring protective gear is cumbersome and weighty, it is the best wayto gain some experience in simulated fighting conditions. The headgear willaffect your vision, and the gloves will be cumbersome and heavy, but you mustcontinue to use good posture and technique. You must be careful not to fall intoa habit of careless defense while wearing the protective gear.STANCEKeep your hands at the proper position, as in photo A. They should not be toolow, as in photo B, because this leaves openings to your face and upper body. Bykeeping your hands too high, as in photo C, the lower-line areas are open, andit also prevents you from delivering an effective straight fast punch withoutfirst repositioning your hands. Besides, it also blocks your vision. Standingtoo much to the side, as in photo D, prevents you from utilizing your rear handfor defense or offense. Being too square, as in photo E, hinders you from rapidforward or backward movement and also exposes your vulnerable groin area.[images/9780897502504_205.jpg]Punching from too wide a stance, as in photo A, weakens your blows because youcannot utilize the full rotation of your hip motion. You are also handicapped inpenetrating or retreating quickly, and your front foot becomes an easy targetfor your opponent.Sparring with your feet too close, as in photo B, upsets your balance andprevents you from delivering a strong punch. Do not throw a punch while leaningback, as in photo C, because there is absolutely no power in such a punch. Apunch must be thrown with your body upright and in balance, with the weightshifting to the lead foot. If you ever have to lean backward, reposition yourbody properly before delivering the blow. Why throw a punch if it is noteffective?Another ineffective blow is hitting while backing away. Your weight has to beshifted forward to have force. In other words, step back, stop, then hit. Afterthe punch, if you have to keep backing up, do the same routine: step back, stop,then hit.It takes good sense of distance and ability to stop in your retreat instantlyand unexpectedly. Learn to maneuver quickly from defense to offense and viceversa.An easy habit to fall into is to punch with your body leaning too far forward,as in photo D. Throwing a punch in this awkward position is futile because youcannot exert enough power into the blow when you are off-balance.Like a good Western boxer, a skilled fighter should be able to hit from anyangle. Each punch prepares him to deliver the next. He is always in balance toshoot any kind of punch. The more skillful he becomes as he learns moreeffective combinations, the more different types of opponents he will conquer.You have to learn to be patient while sparring. Don’t deliver your blows untilyou are certain to hit your opponent. Step toward him when you punch to makecontact. Hit as straight as possible, using your nose as the guide in thedelivery. Don’t overshoot your target because a miss leaves you out of positionand makes you a target for an easy counterpunch, especially against a boxer wholeads. Instead, beat him with lightning-fast leads and draw his counterpuncheswith feints so he will miss.[images/9780897502504_206.jpg]FEINTING AND DRAWINGFeinting is to deceive an opponent into reacting to the motion of your hands,legs, eyes and body. Your feint should entice him to adjust his defense, therebycreating momentary openings. Reaction to a slight wave of the hand, stamp of thefoot, a sudden shout, etc. is normal human behavior. Even an athlete with yearsof experience will be distracted by such a demonstration.No feint is effective unless it compels the opponent to react to your wishes. Tobe successful, it must appear to be a simple movement of attack. The combinationof hitting with the feints should appear to be the same.A feint should be fast, expressive, threatening, changing and precise, followedby a clean, sharp blow. Feints are not as imperative against an unskilledfighter as against a skilled one. Between two evenly matched fighters, the onewho is the master of the feint will be the winner.There are several methods in which to execute the feint. From the on-guardposition, move forward and, without hesitation, bend your lead knee quickly.This slight motion creates an illusion that your arms are also moving when theyaren’t. Another feint is the false thrust. Move your body above the waist bysimply bending your lead knee and extending your front hand slightly. Then asyou advance, take a longer step with your front foot and do a half-extended armthrust. The thrust must appear real to induce the opponent to parry. When theopponent parries, disengage your hand and deliver the real thrust with eitherhand. If the opponent can be reached without a lunge, keep your arm slightlybent, and keep yourself well protected by shifting or by using the rear guard.The arm should be more fully extended if the feinting precedes a kick or alunging attack. Another successful feint is to bend your upper body only whileadvancing.The one-two feint can be employed “inside-outside and outside-inside” or“high-low and low-high” with one or both hands in combination. The initial feintmust be long and deep but quick in order to draw the parry. The next response isto hit the opponent hard before he can recover. This feint is a “long-short”rhythm.In the “long-short-short” rhythm, or the two-feint attack, the first feint mustforce the opponent to a defense. At that moment, the distance is closer for ashort feint before delivering a short but real hit.The “short-long-short” rhythm is a more advanced form of feinting. The opponentis not induced by the first feint, so the second feint is made long to misleadthe opponent into thinking that it is the final thrust of a compound attack,thereby drawing him to parry. In this tactic, speed and penetration are theelements for success.To prevent or lessen the chance of being countered heavily, leads shouldconsistently be preceded by feints. But the continuous use of the same feintwill defeat your purpose because the opponent can take advantage of thismaneuver for a counterattack. Combinations of feints must be practiced untilthey become automatic. You must also train in the use of various types of feintsto learn the different reactions from your opponents.The immediate advantage of a feint is that from the outset, you can lunge toattack with a feint to gain distance. In other words, you can shorten thedistance with a lunge and gain some time from the false attack by causing theopponent to react or hesitate.The feints will be more successful after several real but simple attacks. Thiswill confuse the less mobile opponent who will not know whether the attack isreal or not. It may also excite a light-footed opponent to flee. But if anopponent doesn’t respond to your feint, attack with straight or simplemovements.There are several ways of feinting: (1) Feint a jab to his face and hit him inthe stomach, (2) feint a low side kick to his shin and deliver a hook kick tohis head, (3) feint a jab to his face and deliver a side kick to his stomach,(4) and feint two jabs to his face, then hit his stomach, etc. Experiment withother feints to create openings.Drawing is almost like feinting. Actually, feinting is a segment of drawing. Infeinting, you attempt to deceive your opponent to react to your motion. Indrawing, you leave part of your body uncovered to lead the opponent to attackthat area. As he does, you are prepared to take a defensive measure and areready to counter.Drawing is also a strategy to lead the opponent to respond to your deception,and when he does, he is caught in a trap. For instance, you may retreat quicklyto entice the opponent to lunge at an attack. As he does, you are ready to evadethe attack and counter with a specific blow.[images/9780897502504_207.jpg]BODY MOTIONSpeed and timing complement each other. A fast blow will not be powerful unlessthrown with timing. In photo A, a punch is thrown ineffectively because of apoor sense of timing and distance.You do not have to move with a rapid or jerky motion. Many times a smooth,unhesitant movement that is performed from rest without apparent preparationwill hit the target because it is so unpredictable.Timing is the capability to perceive the right moment for action, such as whenthe opponent is preparing or planning to move, when the opponent is in the midstof a movement, when the opponent is at a tense disposition, or when theopponent’s concentration is in the doldrums.Timing in fighting means perfect delivery as the opponent steps forward or isdrawn into stepping forward. If your timing is off and you launch your blow tooearly, as in photo X, your energy is spent without any telling effect. If yourdelivery is too early, as in photo Y, then your blow is not too effective, asyour force was still developing.Timing a blow is the secret to powerful blows, but no one can be a really heavyhitter, even with perfect timing, unless he has complete confidence in hisability. Timing can be a mental problem, especially when your rhythm is broken.Your mind has difficulty in adjusting to the sudden interruption of yourmovement while it continues for a fraction of a second. This “half beat” ispsychologically disturbing because you expect a full-count movement, but youropponent attacks halfway before the count is completed.Speed is not the chief prerequisite when two fighters of equal ability and speedare matched. There is a slight advantage to the first one who attacks, but thereis a greater advantage to the one who knows how to break the rhythm. Even withonly moderate speed, his half beat or unexpected movement can catch his opponentflat-footed because his rhythm or cadence is interrupted and because he can’tadjust quickly enough.[images/9780897502504_208.jpg]Even with a pair of heavy gloves, you must continue to use basic training, suchas nontelegraphing your blows. Your delivery will not be as efficient with thegloves on, but continue to practice this way because it will increase yourproficiency in the technique—with or without gloves. Because your foot is notburdened with protective gear, kick naturally with speed and force in yoursparring. Do not deliver a kick, as in photo 1, forewarning your opponent ofyour intention.[images/9780897502504_209.jpg][images/9780897502504_210.jpg]In boxing and in some Oriental martial arts, the hands are the primary andalmost the only assets for offense and defense. But in other martial arts, thekicks definitely play a big part in strategic fighting. Unfortunately, manyschools emphasize the foot too heavily and ignore the hand techniques.Bruce Lee used to mention that the hands are the primary weapons for attackingand defending. The foot can be contained by the placement of your foot to theopponent’s, as in photo A, and by closing in on him. But the hands are much moredifficult to contain because they can be thrown from close quarters and from allangles.There are other techniques besides parrying that you can use to defend againstpunches. Often it is better to use an alternative method, such as footwork,because you are usually in a better position to counter. Other alternatives areevasive tactics such as slipping, rolling, weaving and bobbing.Slipping is evading a blow without moving out of countering range. Your timingand judgment must be perfect to be successful because the blow should miss by afraction of an inch.Although slipping can be executed either inside or outside a straight lead, theoutside slip is preferred. It is safer to use and prevents the opponent frompreparing for a counter. The idea is to turn your shoulder and body to the rightor left so you can slip the opponent’s blow over either one of your shoulders.Slipping is a valuable technique in sparring because it allows you to use bothhands for countering. You can hit harder moving inside a punch rather thanblocking or parrying and then countering.The small rotation of your heel is frequently the answer to successful slipping.To slip a right lead over your left shoulder from a right lead stance, raiseyour rear heel and rotate it clockwise, transferring your weight to the leadfoot. Simultaneously bend your lead knee and turn your shoulder in the sameclockwise direction so you will be in a position to retaliate.To slip a lead over your right shoulder, raise your lead heel and rotate itcounterclockwise, transferring your weight to the back foot. Simultaneously bendyour rear knee and turn your shoulder in the same counterclockwise direction,preparing to counter with a right hook.The science of bobbing and weaving is a valuable tactic to avoid blows andimprove your defensive measures to counter with a more powerful punch, such asthe hook. It provides you with access to the use of both hands for attackingwhenever an opening develops.Weaving in sparring involves moving your body from side to side and in and out.In the process, you also keep slipping straight leads directed toward your head.It makes an elusive target of your head because your opponent is uncertain aboutwhich way you will slip. Also, he is in a dilemma because he doesn’t know whichhand will deliver the punch.To weave to the inside against a right lead, slip to the outside position firstby dropping your head and body with a turn of your shoulder and bending of yourknee. Close in under the completed punch and quickly resume your stance. Theopponent’s hand should be over your left shoulder. Keep your hands high and nearyour body. Then, without stopping your motion completely, swing your body to theinside position and engage your right hand to the opponent’s left. Continue toweave and simultaneously counter with right and left punches.To weave to the outside against a right lead, slip to the inside position bydropping your head and body with a twist of your upper body while bending yourknee. Then move your head and body in a circular, counterclockwise motion sothat the opponent’s right hand is over your right shoulder. Keep your hands highand near your body. You should be at the outside position by then, standing inthe on-guard stance.Weaving is more difficult than slipping, but you must master slipping to beskilled in weaving. The key to weaving is to learn the art of relaxation.Weaving is seldom used by itself. Usually it is accompanied by bobbing. Bobbingin fighting is usually referred to as moving the head constantly verticallyrather than side to side. The way to bob is to barely sink under a swing or hookwith a controlled motion. Your body should be in balance at all times so you cancounterattack or slip straight punches even at the bottom of the bob. Don’tcounter or straight-down bob except to the groin. Keep your hands high and useyour knees for motion.The purpose of bobbing and weaving is to close in by sliding under theopponent’s attack. Weave to employ counters of hard, straight punches or hooks.The master of bobbing and weaving is usually a hooking specialist who is able todominate taller opponents. Like other skills in fighting, your weaving andbobbing must not be too rhythmic. You must keep the opponent confused at alltimes.Rolling is moving your body in such a manner that the blow is wasted. Forinstance, against a straight punch and uppercut, you move backward. Against ahook, you move to your left or right. You do the same against a hammer, exceptyou also move downward in a curved motion.Always use evasive tactics with countering kicks or punches. Keep your eyes wideopen because blows do come without much warning, and utilize your elbows andforearms for guarding. Evasive tactics, when used with hard hitting, candiscourage an aggressor and turn the scuffle into grappling. When evasivemaneuvers are not used, parry blows that are directed toward your head.Skill in footwork can be developed greatly during sparring sessions because yourfeet can move freely in any direction. Although circling evasive tactics are notpracticed too heavily in the Oriental martial arts, it is an important segmentof close fighting when the use of kicks is not feasible.In circling to your right, the lead foot is the axis to move your body around.The first step with your lead foot can be either long or short, depending on thesituation. The shorter the step, the smaller the pivot. Keep your lead handslightly higher than normal to prepare for a countering left punch.Circling to the right is used to nullify a right lead hook, to keep the opponentoff-balance and to deliver an advantageous left-hand counter. It is important tomaintain your basic posture, move deliberately without any exaggerated motionand never cross your feet.Circling to your left should be employed more frequently than the right becauseit is safer. You can stay out of range from rear, left-handed punches. But it ismore difficult to do because it requires shorter steps to be exact in yourmovement.The step-in and step-out are offensive maneuvers to create openings and areoften used with a feint. The initial movement is to step in directly with yourhands held high, creating an illusion of delivering a blow, then step outquickly before your opponent can counter. The strategy is to induce him intocomplacency so you can deliver a surprise attack.A fighter with fast footwork and a good lead can impress on others that the artis simple and easy. He can make a slower opponent look bad by the process of hitand run. As the opponent moves in, he confronts him with a lead punch andquickly steps back. As the opponent pursues, he repeats the process—circling andmoving in and out. Occasionally, he will meet his opponent head-on with astraight right or left, or with a combination.Even while you are waiting in the on-guard position, your hands and body shouldbe in a continuous, slightly bobbing motion. The motion can deceive andcamouflage your attack as well as keep your opponent confused. The motion shouldnot be overdone, or it will disturb your timing in attacking and defending.In sparring, learn to be patient. Do not waste your energy by throwing a punchuntil you are almost certain that it will hit the target with power. Throwing apunch by overreaching, as in photo A (see page 232), is risky. First, your punchis too weak to do any damage even if it makes contact. Second, you placeyourself in a precarious position against a counterpunch. And third, you havenot locked your foot to the opponent’s, allowing him freedom to deliver a hookkick to your unprotected groin.[images/9780897502504_211.jpg][images/9780897502504_212.jpg]Back your opponent into a corner or into the ropes before you attack. Throwaccurate punches while you have him cornered. Missing too many times can easilywear you down.For long-range sparring, jab with your lead, as in photo X, and cross with yourrear. Judge your distance correctly before throwing a punch. For short-rangesparring, use hooks, rear-hand body blows and uppercuts, but do not punch fromtoo far out, as in photo Z. Punch through your opponent.Weave as you hit. A hard punch can only be delivered from a solid base.Occasionally take a short step to the left by three or four inches with yourrear foot when throwing a right lead punch. This will put more power in yourpunch, especially from long-range. Don’t ever punch with your foot off theground, as in photo A.Have confidence when you spar. Don’t move away from your opponent when you aredelivering a punch, as in photo B. Your punch will lack power, and you will alsoreveal to your opponent a fear of being hit. Your timid action only increaseshis confidence and decreases your chance of fighting with strategy. Another badgesture is to turn your head away from the attack, as in photo X. Such behaviorleaves you open for additional attacks and prevents you from countering.[images/9780897502504_213.jpg]BAD HABITSDuring sparring is the time to learn your weaknesses and how to overcome them.It is too late in a real fight. You will be surprised to learn your pitfallswhile sparring. Bad habits, such as standing with your feet parallel, may showup. You may only notice it when you find yourself easily being thrownoff-balance, as in photo Y.You may be retreating with your guard down, as in photo Z. But you will learnquickly to keep your guard up after you take several hard blows to your face.There are so many variables in fighting that you cannot follow a stringent plan.You have to be flexible as different situations arise.[images/9780897502504_214.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PART IIIADVANCED TECHNIQUES"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_215.jpg]CHAPTER 12HAND TECHNIQUES FOR OFFENSE(PART A)In jeet kune do, there are hardly any direct attacks. Practically all offensivemaneuvers are indirect—performed after a feint or in the form of acounterattack. One can say that jeet kune do is built on feints and the actionsconnected to them.A perfect attack is the blending of strategy, speed, timing, deception and keenjudgment. A superior fighter strives toward mastering all these elements in hisdaily training.The attack should be launched at your own volition, upon your opponent’s actionor upon his inaction. For instance, a successful attack can be delivered whenyour opponent is withdrawing his arm from the path in which you intended toattack. In other words, attack when the line is open instead of closed. Youropponent is moving in the opposite direction and he must reverse his directionor alter it substantially to counter your hit, allowing you more time tosucceed.Simple attacks will not always work against every opponent. You must learn tovary your attacks and defense. This will bother your opponent and also help youcope with various styles of fighters.You must study your opponent. Take advantage of his weak-nesses and avoid hisstrengths. For instance, if your opponent is good at parrying, you should firstuse a press, feint or beat before attacking to confuse him.The method of attack is dictated by the form of defense. If your opponent is ofyour caliber, your attack will hardly be successful unless it outwits hisdefense. For instance, to deceive your opponent’s hand defense, your handoffense is usually made of semicircular or circular movements. But an offensivecircular movement will not work if it is countered with a simple or lateralmotion of a parry. Therefore, your strike should be based on your anticipationof the opponent’s reaction.It is precarious to attack with anything that comes to mind or to launchyourself into complicated compound attacks that allow your opponent severalchances to perform a stop-hit. The more complex the attack, the less you arelikely to execute it with control. Therefore, your attacks should be simple.But if your opponent is equal in speed and skill and has a good sense ofdistance, a simple attack may not score a hit. Against such an opponent, youhave to use compound attacks and take advantage of distance.A compound attack is a preliminary action, such as a feint, beat, etc., thatlaunches before your real attack. The success of the compound attack dependsdirectly on the parry of your feint or initial attack of your opponent. You haveto study the opponent’s reaction before applying the compound attack.Compound attacks depend on timing and opportunity. Many compound attacks failbecause the attacker doesn’t time his feints correctly. They should be movingjust slightly before the real attack. Compound attacks can be short, fastcombinations or deep, fast and penetrative combinations.A simple compound attack—just one feint or one preliminary action—has a betterchance to score if it is executed on the opponent’s preparation, especially ifhe is stepping forward. Against an opponent who has slow feet or is exhausted,use the double-lead.While attacking, you should act and look as fierce as a wild animal to psych outyour opponent. You should attack with determination but not recklessness. It isrisky to attack halfheartedly.Even with good techniques, you can be frustrated by a skilled opponent’sdefensive measures. Therefore, you should time your attack perfectly so youropponent cannot evade your blows. The following are some of the hand techniquesused in jeet kune do.LEADING FINGER JABThe leading finger jab, as in photo X, like the shin or knee side kick, is thefirst line of offense or defense. It allows you an additional three to fourinches in reach and provides a fast strike because it travels only a shortdistance to the target.Like other skilled movements, it must be practiced when you are fresh. Wheneveryou are fatigued, your tendency is to use sloppy motions for finesse andgeneralized efforts for specific actions. By using continuous, sloppy movements,your proficiency is retarded and may even retrogress. Anytime you are exhausted,change your drills from skill-based to endurance-type exercises.The finger jab is executed from an on-guard position, as in photo 1. Just beforethrusting, the fingers of your striking hand should be extended, as in photo 2.You should complete your strike directly in front of your nose, as in photo 3and not like in photo A, which leaves an opening at the upper-line area.To attack directly with a finger jab against a skilled fighter is quitedifficult. Bruce Lee always used it with a feint first.[images/9780897502504_216.jpg][images/9780897502504_217.jpg][images/9780897502504_218.jpg]For instance, Lee stands in the on-guard position as he faces his opponent, asin photo 1, who is in a similar position. He then feints low by crouchingslightly and moves forward as if to attack the opponent’s midsection. Thiscauses the opponent to lower his guarding rear hand, as in photo 2. As soon asthe opening develops, Lee quickly thrusts his fingers into the opponent’s eye,as in photo 3. Notice that Lee places his right foot next to the opponent’s toprevent any retaliation from the opponent’s foot. A feint is a preliminarymotion to entice your opponent to react. You draw him to parry to a particularline, then you deliver an attack using another line or path.Against an opponent in a left lead stance, as in photo A, Lee fakes with hisright-hand lead to lower the opponent’s leading hand, as in photo B. In thisinstance, Lee is only concerned about the opponent’s lead hand because it isobstructing his path to the target. Once the obstruction is removed, Lee quicklytakes advantage of the moment with a quick thrust to the opponent’s eye, as inphoto C. In this attack, Lee is able to accomplish his technique from a fartherdistance. The feint can also be a low shin kick to disturb the opponent’scomposure. Besides using it as a feint, it also prevents the opponent fromdelivering a kick.[images/9780897502504_219.jpg]Whether it is a jab, punch or kick, speed is so important when you want to leadan opponent. You must have speed over him rather than let him keep up or catchup to you.Speed and timing should work together. You should be able to dictate the rhythmto your opponent by either speeding up or slowing down your movements. Anotherway is to establish a natural rhythm and then suddenly attack when your opponentis in the doldrums and his motion begins to drag.Economy of motion and keeping your muscles flexible can increase your speed. Afault of most novice competitors is that they try too hard to finish the matchquickly and begin to press and hasten their actions. This only makes them lesseffective because the tension causes unnecessary muscular contractions that actas brakes—reducing their speed and expending their energy.A higher performance is obtained when an athlete is free and unrestrained,rather than when he tries to force or drive himself. When a runner is going asfast as he can, he should not feel that he ought to be going faster.Another effective technique is to change your timing, like slowing down insteadof speeding up your movement, just before impact. In other words, there is amoment of pause in the launching strike’s forward path, compelling your opponentto open a vulnerable line as he is thrown out of timing.Timing may mean success or failure in your offensive and defensive techniques.An attack or counter should occur at the moment your opponent appears inept.Attacks should come when your opponent is engrossed in preparing his offensebecause he is momentarily concentrating more on his attack than his defense.Other opportune times for attacking occur when there is an absence of touchduring an engagement or transition to an engagement, and when the opponent is inmotion—stepping forward, backward or side-to-side—because he cannot intuitivelychange direction until his action is completed.It takes a great deal of concentration and practice to develop this awareness ofyour opponent’s weak moment. You must also learn not to be trapped by amisleading, false rhythm emanated by a clever fighter. Rather, you should workto develop your ability to dictate the fighter’s rhythm yourself, enabling youto land an unexpected blow.In broken rhythm, speed is no longer the primary element in the success of anattack or counterattack. There is a tendency, if the rhythm has been wellestablished, to continue in the sequence of the movement. Each man is“motor-set” to continue in that sequence. If you can break this set rhythm by aslight hesitation or an unexpected movement, you can now score an attack orcounterattack with only moderate speed. Your opponent is motor-set to continuewith the previous rhythm, and before he can adjust himself to the change, hewill be hit by you. Broken rhythm will often catch your opponent mentally andphysically off-guard for defense.[images/9780897502504_220.jpg]LEADING STRAIGHT RIGHTThe leading straight is the “bread and butter” punch of jeet kune do, as inphoto 1. It is a reliable, offensive weapon because the delivery is short,accurate and quick.It can be a powerful blow if you twist your hips just a split second beforedelivery. The blow should land in front of your nose, as in photo A and not likephoto B. Your guard hand should be close to defend your head against anycounterpunch. The blow should land directly on the opponent’s face, as in photoC.[images/9780897502504_221.jpg][images/9780897502504_222.jpg]The straight right should be delivered directly from the on-guard position, asin photos 1 and lA. Your hand should not telegraph your intention beforedelivery. Do not add extra movement, such as withdrawing your fist just beforedelivery. The only motion should come as a consequence of your slight weavingand bobbing while you are looking for an opening or waiting to counter. Punchstraight out, as in photos 2 and 2A, with your fist in the vertical position.Your rear hand should be in the guard position, ready to block any blow. Byextending your shoulder into the blow, you can increase your reach by as much asfour inches and not reduce the impact of your punch. However, you must use yourbody properly and punch through, as in photos 3 and 3A.[images/9780897502504_223.jpg][images/9780897502504_224.jpg]Against someone standing closer to him, as in photo 1, Lee delivers a quick,straight right without telegraphing his intention, as in photo 2. But againstsomeone standing farther away, as in photo A, or who has the inclination toretreat, Lee penetrates a little deeper to launch his blow, as in photo B.In all hand techniques, the hand moves before the foot. Delivery must beeconomical from any angle and from any distance. In an attack, the movementsmust be as concealing or as slight as ever, especially with your hands, toinhibit the opponent from reacting into a defensive or countering measure.[images/9780897502504_225.jpg]You must understand that there is an opening for every lead, a counter for eachopening, and a block or parry for each counter. You must know when and how touse the lead with some security to be a master of this attack.LEAD TO BODYAlthough the leading right to the body is not necessarily a heavy blow, it canbe used effectively to bother your opponent and bring his guard down. If thepunch is driven into the solar plexus, it can do real damage to the opponent, asin photo A. In photo 1, Lee demonstrates a full-view lead to the body.[images/9780897502504_226.jpg][images/9780897502504_227.jpg][images/9780897502504_228.jpg][images/9780897502504_229.jpg][images/9780897502504_229a.jpg][images/9780897502504_229b.jpg]To execute the leading right to the body, stand in the on-guard position, as inphoto 1 and lA. Then drop your body down and step forward, as in photos 2 and2A. Your front leg should be slightly bent, and your rear leg should be moreflexible. As you strike in at an angle, your chin should naturally move intoyour right shoulder. At the punch’s full extension, your rear hand should guardyour face, as in photos 3 and 3A, and your weight should shift almost completelyto your front foot.It is important that you follow through with your punch. Try to sink your bodyto the level of the target so your blow will be delivered slightly upward oralmost horizontally. This delivery position is safer and more effective.[images/9780897502504_230.jpg]Lee stands in the on-guard position against a right-lead opponent, as in photo1. He moves in quickly with a blow to the midsection, simultaneously using hisleft hand to block a high lead punch, as in photo 2.Most people are weak in their low-line defense, and blows toward that sectionare effective especially during a disengagement. A disengagement is a singlemovement that happens when the opponent’s hand passes from the line ofengagement into the opposite line, i.e. throwing a hit from a closed line intoan open line. Timing is very important because you must start your attack as theopponent’s arm is moving across the line or in the opposite direction.Against a left-lead opponent, as in photo A, Lee feints with his lead hand todraw his opponent’s hands upward, as in photo B. As soon as the openingdevelops, Lee drives a hard lead right to the solar plexus, as in photo C. He isnow in position to deliver a left-to-right combination.To defend against a straight lead from a right stance, you can do severalthings. First, keep your left hand open and hold it slightly higher than normalwhile keeping it weaving. As the opponent’s punch is launched toward your face,lean a little to your left and parry the blow with your left hand by slappinghis wrist and forearm. No amount of strength is required to deflect even apowerful strike. The deflection will leave your opponent off-guard andoff-balance for a quick counter to his face or body. Second, swing to your leftby stepping in with your right foot and letting go a hard right to the body orface. Third, move to the right by stepping in with your right foot and throwinga strong left to the body or head in a cross-counter. Fourth, take a step backand counter as you move forward.[images/9780897502504_231.jpg]STRAIGHT LEFTThe straight left is a powerful blow if delivered properly, as in photo X. It isused as a counter or as part of a combination. More power is generated than in alead punch because you are standing farther away and can increase the momentumof the blow before it makes contact with its target. Furthermore, you have thefull use of your body to put behind the punch.[images/9780897502504_232.jpg][images/9780897502504_233.jpg]But for most right-handers, using the left is unnatural, especially when thrownfrom a distance. To develop skill in punching with your left, practice with itconstantly on the heavy bag until it is just as proficient as the other hand.To throw a straight left, stand in the on-guard position, as in photos 1 and 1A.Rotate your hips clockwise, pivoting mostly on your flexed rear foot, as inphotos 2 and 2A. Your weight should shift to your front foot, and your lead handshould be drawn to your face for protection, as in photos 3 and 3A. Your punchshould be delivered straight in front of your nose and not like in photo X,where your upper line is left unguarded after the delivery. Your target can beanywhere on your opponent’s head, but the most vulnerable spot is the side ofhis jaw, as in photo Y. But do not aim at the head all the time. Sometimes aimat the opponent’s centerline and drive through it.[images/9780897502504_234.jpg]Against someone in the same stance as you, i.e. right lead, as in photo 1, Leecreates an opening with a feint, as in photo 2. First he throws a right bystepping out with his right foot. The opponent responds by raising his hands tomeet the blow. Just before Lee’s right connects and obstructs the opponent’ssight, he delivers a straight left to the opponent’s face, as in photo 3. Thisdelivery is done with a twist of his hip to the right as he pivots on the soleof his left foot. The pivot should be done sharply with a snap of the hip andcompleted with a snap of the left shoulder.If your opponent steps back without parrying or blocking, it is often a goodmaneuver to renew the attack, aiming at an advanced target such as the shin orknee. It is also effective against someone who opens himself up by retreatingwith wide movements, or against someone who tries to parry but is off-balanceand caught in a moment of hesitation.Against an opponent who places his weight on the rear foot instead of taking ashort step back, attack that rear foot. The effectiveness of a renewed attackdepends highly on your knowledge of the way your opponent fights. It can hardlysucceed without preliminary plans. You must also have good footwork for a quickforward recovery and an ability to keep your opponent off-balance.[images/9780897502504_235.jpg]The techniques of a renewed attack are a straight thrust and a feint, or a beator trap done in combinations. An attack by combination is usually comprised ofsetups. It is a series of punches or kicks delivered naturally and to more thanone line. The purpose of the attack is to draw or force your opponent into aprecarious position for a finishing blow.Combination blows come in certain sequences. For instance, it is natural topunch to the head first and then punch to the body with a straight punch andthen a hook, a right hook and then a straight left, or a straight left and thena right jab.[images/9780897502504_236.jpg]There are also triple blows in combinations. For instance, you can get youropponent by launching two blows to his body after a slip. This generally resultsin your opponent dropping his guard and leaving an opening for the final andthird blow.There is also the safety triple in which the first blow and the final blow landon the same target. For example, if the initial punch is to the body and thesecond to the jaw, then the last punch should target the body, as in photos A toD. Lee uses a feint to open up his opponent. He then strikes his opponent with arear cross to the body, followed by a lead hook to the head, and finishes bythrowing the rear cross back to the body.[images/9780897502504_237.jpg][images/9780897502504_238.jpg]Often, the left or rear thrust is used as a countering blow. This can be done bydrawing your opponent to lead an attack with a punch. When he does, duck yourhead slightly and step inside his right lead, letting it slip over your leftshoulder. Then throw your left punch with power by snapping your left shoulder.Keep your eyes constantly on his left hand, stopping it with your right if heuses it.Against someone in the opposite stance, as in photo 1, Lee feints with hisright, as in photo 2, then quickly delivers a straight left to the opponent’sface, as in photo 3. Notice in photo 2 (see page 259) and photo 2 (oppositepage), that Lee doesn’t have to penetrate too deeply when the opponent stands inthe opposite position from him.A decoy or false attack is employed not to hit but to draw or entice youropponent to attack along a specific line so you can parry the blow and counter.The attack is not a lunge but just a slight movement of the foot or body tocreate a response."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_239.jpg]CHAPTER 13HAND TECHNIQUES FOR OFFENSE(PART B)Although speed is important, too many fighters put too much emphasis on it. Whena fighter’s offensive blows fail, often times it’s because he uses the wrongstrikes and blames his failures on a lack of speed.A fighter must use the proper strikes at the right time against his opponent. Touse the correct strikes, he has to study his opponent’s style from differentangles and study his opponent’s tactics and timing. Included in this section aresome of the strikes that are used in jeet kune do.[images/9780897502504_240.jpg][images/9780897502504_241.jpg]STRAIGHT LEFT TO THE BODYThe straight left blow to the body, as in photo 1, like the straight left (seepage 256), is powerful and can be used as a counter, after a feint with theleading hand, or even in combination. Like the leading jab (see page 272) orleading straight, the body should follow the punch.It is a punishing punch and can be applied with some safety because you are in acrouch position when you deliver the punch. The opportunity to use this punch isalso frequent because it is one of the best counters against an opponent whostands in an opposing (opposite) lead stance, exposing his right side.It is also effective in drawing your opponent’s guard down, and it has been usedtriumphantly against tall fighters. This technique should be used primarilyagainst an opponent who keeps his rear hand high to protect his face whendelivering a lead punch.The punch is delivered almost like the straight left, except the blow isdirected to the midsection, as in photo A, or to the solar plexus. From anon-guard right-lead position, as in photos 1 and lA, bend your knee slightly andkeep your rear leg flexed, as in photo 2. Your lead hand draws toward your face,as in photo 2A, and now becomes the guard as you thrust your left hand forward.Your weight shifts to the front foot as you pivot on your back foot. For a morepowerful blow, you can step slightly to the right as the blow is thrown. Whenreturning to your original position, keep your lead shoulder raised to protectyourself against an opponent’s left cross or left hook.[images/9780897502504_242.jpg][images/9780897502504_243.jpg]Meanwhile, your right guard hand should be open and held close to your face bythe time your thrust is completed, as in photos 3 and 3A. Sink your body so theblow can be thrown slightly upward or almost horizontal to your target. Don’texpose your upper-line area when using this punch, as in photo Y.[images/9780897502504_244.jpg]Against an opponent in a matching (same) stance, as in photo 1, Lee creates anopening with a deep, false attack, drawing the opponent to raise his hands tomeet the attack, as in photo 2. Then Lee quickly sinks his body and smashes aleft to the midsection, as in photo 3. His head is down along his left shoulderand well-protected against a counter.Against an opponent who stands in the opposite stance, as in photo A, Lee’spenetration is not too deep. Instead, he feints a lead right to the opponent’sface, as in photo B, while at the same time stepping in closer. When theopponent commits himself to the feint, Lee drives a hard straight left to hisbody, as in photo C. At this point, Lee’s right hand is up and open, and hiselbow is down to guard against any counters.[images/9780897502504_245.jpg]Sometimes, instead of feinting to draw the opponent’s lead, just wait for him tolead. Then quickly attack when there is an opening to his body. A body attackdoes have an advantage over a head attack because your target is bigger and lessmobile.To stop a rear-thrust counter to your body, just leave your front arm acrossyour body and raise your lead shoulder in case your opponent throws a double-hitor “loop” punch.LEAD JABThe jab is not a powerful punch, but it is useful because it keeps your opponentoff-balance and from becoming “set.” It is a fast, snappy punch and not a push.Your hand should be held, launched and returned high to offset a rear-handcounter. The arms should be relaxed and should sink instead of pulling back whenbrought back to the on-guard position.It is practical to launch more than one jab because the second one has a goodchance to land if the previous one was delivered with economy. The subsequentone is also a cover-up for a missed jab. A multitude of jabs can be thrown tokeep your opponent on the defensive as you steadily press him, offering him norest.BACKFISTThe backfist, as in photo 1, is one of the most surprising punches you candeliver because it is fast, accurate and nontelegraphic. It can be launched fromeither the on-guard position or even when you are standing nonchalantly withyour hands hanging loosely by your hips. In the latter position, you are in anonthreatening position and able to sneak a blow in before your opponent isprepared to defend himself.[images/9780897502504_246.jpg][images/9780897502504_247.jpg]The delivery of the leading backfist should come directly from the front handwithout telegraphing it, as in photo X. The blow should come overhand and notlike in photo Y, in which the hand is chambered and swung horizontally. The blowcan also be directed anywhere on your opponent’s face, but the temple is thebest target to aim at, as in photo Z.[images/9780897502504_248.jpg]From the on-guard position, as in photos 1 and lA, the leading backfist isdelivered in a vertical, semicircular motion, as in photos 2 and 2A. Yourbodyweight shifts to the front as your rear hand simultaneously moves slightlydownward to protect against any kicks as well as any punches to your head orbody, as in photos 3 and 3A. Open your rear hand for parrying.[images/9780897502504_249.jpg][images/9780897502504_250.jpg]Against an opponent in the right lead stance, as in photo 1, Lee traps theopponent’s arm with his right hand and places his front foot on the opponent’sright foot to prevent him from kicking, as in photo 2. Then Lee quickly switcheshis hands, using his left to immobilize the opponent’s right arm and his righthand to apply a backfist as he steps in, as in photo 3.Against someone standing in the left lead position, as in photos A to C, Leeuses the same technique as in the prior illustrations.From the on-guard position, as in photo A, Lee uses his right hand to trap theopponent’s left hand, as in photo B. He places his lead foot next to theopponent’s lead foot to prevent a countering kick. Then Lee swiftly moves in ashe switches his hands, using his left for grabbing and his right to deliver ablow, as in photo C. Notice that Lee uses his left hand to jerk his opponenttoward him as he simultaneously delivers a semicircular blow.Trapping, or immobilizing, is a method of stopping your opponent from movingcertain parts of his body, and it guarantees you safety while you launch yourattack. For instance, one hand can be used for pinning an opponent and the otherfor striking him. It can also be used as a protective maneuver when you arecountering or slipping an attack. Trapping is basically used to collide with theopponent’s line of attack before engagement.Trapping, deflecting, beating or engaging the hand of your opponent will causehim to withdraw or limit his reaction, or force him to parry too soon or losecontrol of his performance. The foot can also be used to immobilize youropponent from kicking.[images/9780897502504_251.jpg]You can limit your opponent from executing a successful stop-hit if you deflector trap his hand while stepping forward. When trapping, you should cover yourlines or use other means as guards and keep your movement tight. Also, as youare trapping or have already trapped your opponent’s hand, use a stop-hit ortimed hit if there is a disengagement.HOOK PUNCHThe hook, as in photo X, is a good countering or follow-up blow because it isbasically a short-range weapon that catches the opponent as he moves in. Thelead hook can also be used as a lead when your opponent fails to move out ofyour way. But usually this punch is used faster after a straight lead like a jabor after some other tactics. For instance, it can be used after feinting a crossto obtain leverage and distance.The hook should not be thrown in a wide, looping way but should be easy, snappyand loose. In hooking loosely, the whip of the arm is the result of the bodyturning away from the arm until the play of the shoulder joint is used to thelimit. Then the arm must follow the turning body. If done suddenly, this causesthe arm to whip forward like an arrow from a bow.[images/9780897502504_252.jpg][images/9780897502504_253.jpg]The hand should not telegraph your intention by withdrawing or lowering beforedelivery. It is not necessary to pull your hand back like many boxers do. Thereis enough power without doing that if you use your footwork properly. Keep yourlead heel raised outward so that the body can pivot easily. The weight of thebody should shift to the opposite side from the punching hand. If you arethrowing a lead hook, you must step in with the punch in order to make contact.In a lead hook, keep your rear hand high to shield your face while your rearelbow protects your side. The hook should be thrown from an on-guard position todeceive your opponent, and after it is completed, you should return to the sameposition. Keep the lead shoulder high for full leverage when you hook to theside of the opponent’s chin, as in photo Y.[images/9780897502504_254.jpg]Minimize your motion so that your action is just enough to have the maximumeffect without hooking uncontrollably. If you exaggerate the outside hook, itwill turn into a swing, as in photo X. Instead you must keep it tight, as inphoto Y. Besides, if you open a hook, you also reduce your defenses. The moresharply your elbow is bent, as in photo Z, the tighter and more explosive thehook. Keep your arm a little more rigid just before impact.[images/9780897502504_255.jpg]To deliver the hook from the on-guard position, as in photo 1, keep your rearguard high, as in photo 2, and your lead heel raised outward to pivot with ease.Then swiftly rotate your hips counterclockwise as you deliver the hook, as inphoto 3, shifting your weight to your rear foot. Throw the blow with snap whileconcentrating on your speed. Like the other blows, drive your hook through theopponent. The greatest difficulty in the hook is throwing the punch withcomplete control of your body.The lead hook should be used wisely. Against a clever, defensive fighter, thismay be the only way to penetrate his defense or open it up by forcing him to useother tactics. But the hook is mostly effective when you move in or out. If youare against an opponent who throws an overreaching straight punch or swings hisarm, the hook is valuable.[images/9780897502504_256.jpg]Against an opponent in the same stance, as in photo 1, the lead hook is oftendelivered when he has lowered his rear-hand guard, as in photo 2, or after hehas thrown a lead jab. The punch is delivered with the weight on the rear foot,the hips rotating and the ball of the raised front foot pivoting, as in photo 3.Against an opponent standing in the opposite position, as in photo A, Leeemploys a false attack by crouching slightly and feinting a rear straightthrust, as in photo B. As the opponent drops his lead to block the punch, Leeretaliates with a high hook to his jaw, as in photo C.[images/9780897502504_257.jpg]The hook is a natural punch when combined with a side step. You are movingobliquely, and your direction facilitates an easy swing at the opponent.Paradoxically, when your opponent is sidestepping, a hook is the practical punchto deliver, too.The lead hook is also good in close-quarters fighting. The blow is thrown fromthe side or outside the opponent’s range of vision. Besides, it can also goaround the guard, which is an important offense, especially after the opponentis shaken up by a straight blow.The hook to the body is more damaging in close-range fighting. Additionally, thebody is an easier target—larger than the jaw and less mobile. To close in, feintto the head. Then swiftly step forward with the front foot and throw your leadhook into his midsection or the nearest target. The groin is a good targetbecause it is harder to protect than, for instance, the jaw. When delivering thepunch in close, duck to the opposite side of the hand that is throwing the hook.To do this, you have to bend your front knee so your shoulder will be almost thesame level with the striking point. Retain your balance by keeping the toe ofyour back foot well extended. Keep your guard hand constantly close to yourface.Even though straight punches are recommended for medium-distance fighting, thehook should be used against an opponent who is blocking, evading or counteringthe straight punches. Vary your punches from high to low to high and from asingle strike to a combination.The rear hook is an asset for close fighting, especially when you are breakingaway or when the opponent is breaking away from you. This punch can alsodistract the opponent away from the lead hook.The hook is mastered by training on a small speed bag. Hit it sharply withouttwisting your body into distortion. To defend against it, do not move away fromthe opponent but move into the hook and let it pass around your neck.UPPERCUTThe uppercut is used in close-quarters fighting. The blow, an upward scoopingmotion with the closed palm facing you, can be administered with either the leador rear hand. The uppercut is almost useless against a fast, upright boxer whouses long lead jabs to your face. But it is a natural technique against someonewho puts his head down and charges, swinging wildly.To deliver an effective short uppercut, keep your knees bent before striking andstraighten them as you throw the punch. At impact, you should be on your toesand leaning slightly backward. The weight should be on your left foot if theblow is a right uppercut and vice versa if the blow is a left uppercut.Against a right-lead opponent, use your left hand to trap the opponent’s rightarm as you deliver a right-lead uppercut. To execute the left-rear uppercut, thelead hand is drawn back to protect your head and also to be prepared forcountering. The left hand should be lowered so the inertia of the blow is acrossand up."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_258.jpg]CHAPTER 14ATTACKS WITH KICKSIn attacking, the best kicks to use are the quick, fast ones. A kick has to bedelivered before your opponent can defend against or move away from it. Be sureyour opponent doesn’t take advan­tage of your commitment. Attempt to psych outyour opponent with punishing blows while inflicting sharp pain.In your training, be aware of your delivery, landing and recov­ery. Use kicksthat snap from the knee for more power, and com­bine both the knee and the hipfor more speed.Learn to control your body so you can kick from a high, low or ground levelwhile you are in motion—advancing, retreating, circling to the left or to theright.LEADING SHIN AND KNEE KICKIt is natural for most martial artists to use or rely on their feet as theirinitial weapon for attacking because the leg is stronger and longer than thearm. In jeet kune do, the low side kick to the shin or knee, as in photo A, isused initially in the first encounter. The kick is explosive whether it isthrusting or snapping, and it can wreck the opponent’s knee with one blow. It isa good technique to bridge the gap in order to employ combinations. Even if thekick is not thrown excessively, it still can discourage an opponent from takingthe initiative and keep him at a distance.[images/9780897502504_259.jpg][images/9780897502504_260.jpg]Against someone standing in the same stance, as in photo 1, Lee sweeps his leadhand upward to distract his opponent, as in photo 2. Lee quickly lunges forwardto deliver his low side kick to the knee, forcing his opponent to the ground,and continues to kick without letting up, as in photo 3. Notice how far Leestands from his opponent when the kick is delivered.[images/9780897502504_261.jpg]Against someone standing in an opposite stance, as in photo 1, Lee uses the sameapproach by sweeping his hand upward, as in photo 2. He then quickly drives hisside kick to the opponent’s left knee as in photo 3. Notice that Lee approachesthe opponent with his eyes upon the opponent’s face and not on his knee or thetarget area. Lee does this to camouflage his intentions and to keep his opponentfrom guessing his intention.LEADING SIDE KICKThe side kick is the most powerful blow in jeet kune do, as in photo A. It is sostrong that, many times, even a block will not prevent it from knocking down orhurting your opponent. The kick can be launched from a medium distance, butthere is more power if it is launched from farther out because you can increaseyour momentum before contact.[images/9780897502504_262.jpg]Against someone in the same stance, as in photo 1, Lee raises his hand from amedium distance, as in photo 2, keeping his other hand down to protect from acountering kick. He quickly delivers a side kick to the opponent’s ribs, as inphoto 3, hurling him backward, as in photo 4. Although the kick is powerful, itis quite difficult to hit your opponent solidly if he is a defensive fighter.The defensive measures are used by the opponent to either move far enough awayfrom the point of penetration or sidestep away from the kick. Another defensivemeasure is to parry the blow for a chance of grabbing it.[images/9780897502504_263.jpg][images/9780897502504_264.jpg][images/9780897502504_265.jpg]Against someone in the opposite stance, as in photo A, Lee just moves in,studying the reaction of the opponent, as in photo B. When the opponent startsto back off from the attack, Lee lunges with­out any hesitation, as in photo C.Moving faster than the oppo­nent, Lee delivers his side kick, as in photo D.[images/9780897502504_266.jpg][images/9780897502504_267.jpg]In the series of photos on the opposite page, as the opponent stands in theopposite stance, as in photo 1, Lee tries his familiar hand­-raised feint as hemoves forward, as in photo 2. But this time, the opponent refuses to respond, soLee changes his tactics and uses a high side kick over the opponent’s guardinghands, as in photo 3.HOOK KICKThe hook kick is the most dominating kick in jeet kune do, as in photo A,because it is easy to hit your opponent with. The way the kick is deliveredgives you more opportunities to attack and, at the same time, offers yousecurity when at a medium-fighting distance. It can be delivered quickly and isvery versatile. It can be aimed at the head, midsec­tion and even the groin.[images/9780897502504_268.jpg][images/9780897502504_269.jpg]Against an opponent in a right lead stance, as in photo 1, Lee first feints aknee kick, drawing the opponent’s guarding hand down, as in photo 2. Once theopponent reacts to the feint, Lee sends a high hook kick to his face, as inphotos 3 and 3A.The feint must be impressive enough to create a response from the opponent. Thenumber of feints should be limited to be effec­tive. It is risky to try anattack with more than two feints. The more complicated the maneuvers of thecompound attack, the less the probability of success.The feint is one method of gaining distance. Your first feint should shorten thedistance by at least one-half between you and your opponent. Your next motionshould cover the last half of the distance. Your feint should be prolonged togive your opponent ample time to react, but not prolonged too long so he hastime to block your attack. You have to be just ahead of it. All your motionsshould be slight and just enough for a response.[images/9780897502504_270.jpg]In this next series of encounters against an opponent with a right lead stance,as in photo 1, Lee tries the raising-hand distraction to open up the midsectionarea, as in photo 2. When the opponent responds to the bluff, Lee delivers ahook kick to his left side, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_271.jpg]Against an opponent in the opposite stance, as in photo A, Lee lowers his body,as in photo B, and fakes a low hook kick to draw the opponent’s left hand toprotect his low-line area, as in photo C. When he does, Lee delivers a high hookkick to his head, as in photo D. This hook kick is easier to execute againstsomeone who is in the same stance as yours.[images/9780897502504_272.jpg]SPIN KICKThe spin kick, as in photo A, is used cautiously in jeet kune do because,against a defensive or less aggressive fighter, you may be caught with your backto him while you are turning. Nevertheless, it is a valu­able kick against anunwary opponent who keeps rushing you.The spin kick is one of the most difficult to perform because it can leave youoff-balance while revolving. Hitting the target can also be a problem because,for a moment, you have to take your eyes off it and still hit it while your bodyis turning.The spin kick is used mostly as a counter, but from time to time, it can be usedas an attack to surprise your opponent. Against someone in the same stance, asin photo 1, Lee sweeps his hand upward as a distraction as he moves toward hisopponent. Then, at the right moment, he pivots on his right foot and rotates hisbody sud­denly, as in photo 2. He tries to keep his eyes on his opponent tojudge his distance. Before the opponent can react, Lee delivers a spin kick tohis midsection, as in photo 3. Some martial artists employ the spin kick in asweeping or slapping motion so the blow is projected from the side. But in jeetkune do, it is more of a thrust, with the blow hitting the target’s frontdirectly.[images/9780897502504_273.jpg][images/9780897502504_274.jpg]To apply a high spin kick against his opponent in the same stance, as in photoA, Lee fakes with his lead hand, as in photo B. But the opponent doesn’t respondto the gesture in photo B, so Lee quickly pivots on his right foot and sends ahigh kick to the face, as in photo C. This drives him back, as in photo D.[images/9780897502504_275.jpg][images/9780897502504_276.jpg][images/9780897502504_277.jpg]Against someone in the opposite stance, as in photo 1, Lee sweeps his hand, asin photo 2. He quickly turns his body com­pletely, as in photo 3, to drive aspin kick between the opponent’s guard, forcing him off his feet, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_278.jpg]Although the spin kick works best against an unwary, aggressive type of fighter,sometimes it is also very effective against a fighter who doesn’t expect it. Injeet kune do, this is one of the few times the rear foot is used for kickingfrom the on-guard position.SWEEP KICKFirst, the sweep or reverse kick is seldom used in jeet kune do because, againstsomeone in the same stance as you, the lead hand is always protecting the face.Second, the kick is delivered high and is apt to be caught by an experiencedfighter. Third, the kick is not powerful enough to knock your opponent down.The sweep kick is effective against an unwary opponent who tends to only protecthis left side while standing in the right lead position. It is also one of thefew kicks that will penetrate against an opponent who habitually leaves his leadfoot high above the ground to jam while attacking.[images/9780897502504_279.jpg][images/9780897502504_280.jpg]Against someone in the same stance, as in photo 1, Lee begins to deliver a sweepkick, as in photo 2. The delivery of the kick is similar in this case to a frontkick and deceives the oppo­nent who attempts a low block. Unencumbered, the kickfinds its target, as in photo 3. The path of the kick is from left to right in asemicircular motion, as in photo X and diagram A.[images/9780897502504_281.jpg][images/9780897502504_282.jpg]Against an opponent in the opposite stance, as in photos 1 (side view) and 1A(bird’s-eye view), Lee moves in such a way that the opponent thinks he is aboutto send a side kick to his midsection, as in photos 2 and 2A. While the opponentanticipates the side kick, Lee hits the face by driving his foot above theguarding hand, as in photos 3 and 3A.[images/9780897502504_283.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_284.jpg]CHAPTER 15DEFENSE AND COUNTERCounterattacking is a crafty maneuver. First, it is quite safe to use and can bevery damaging to your opponent because he is general­ly caught moving in.Second, if you are matched against someone equally as skilled as you, you havethe advantage because your opponent is bound to expose more of himself as he isleading and committing himself to an attack. In the meantime, you are remainingin the on-guard stance, wait­ing for the opening. It is preferable to feint youropponent into leading instead of waiting for him to take the initiative.The art of counterattacking can be applied after provoking your opponent toattack, or by drawing and luring him into attacking by purposely leavingyourself open. The idea of countering is to avoid the blow and hit your opponentwhile he is off-balance or not in position to guard himself.Countering requires real proficiency in the art of fighting. It is actually anadvanced form of offense. For each lead, there are numerous counters, but youshould select the most effective one instantly. This can only be done withconstant practice until you are conditioned to react spontaneously.After countering, follow up by pressing your opponent until he is down, or untilhe retaliates. Be careful of an opponent who uses the double-hit. His first blowis used to entice you to attack, but his second blow will be the real one, asyou attempt to counter it.LEADING FINGER JABThe leading finger jab is a good defensive counterattack weap­on for stopping anattack before it unfolds, and as a consequence, it frustrates your opponent. Itis easy to employ and is so quick that the opponent gets it in his eye before hecan deliver his punch. It is thrown with your fingers outstretched, lengtheningthe ex­tension of your hand, as in photo A.It is a good stop-hit weapon, and you should use it at every opportunity duringthe course of fighting. It enables you not only to score effectively and createopenings but can also quickly de­moralize an aggressive and confident opponent.Lee was a skillful exponent of the stop-hit. Here, he shows how to use itagainst an opponent standing in the opposite stance, as in photo 1. Lee quicklymoves in as he sees the opponent’s swing coming, as in photo 2. With his leadhand, which has to travel a much shorter distance than it would with a swingfrom the rear hand, Lee thrusts the finger jab toward his opponent’s face, as inphoto 3. Lee constantly keeps his guard hand high to block, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_285.jpg][images/9780897502504_286.jpg][images/9780897502504_287.jpg]A stop-hit must be correctly timed to launch just when the opponent begins hisattack. The idea is to anticipate and intercept the attacker in his path and, atthe same time, deliver a blow, keeping yourself secure by either moving out ofthe attacker’s reach or by use of other covering. Success depends on properanticipation and timing as well as hitting the target perfectly.An effective maneuver against a swinging opponent is to coun­ter-time (brokenrhythm) into his action, or you can stop-kick into an advanced target, like theknee, groin, or an exposed area.In the previous sequence, against someone in the opposite stance, as in photo A,Lee prepares for the attack. As soon as his oppo­nent is about to deliver astraight lead, Lee quickly intercepts the blow and continues with a right fingerjab to the opponent’s eye, as in photo B. He keeps his rear hand high to protectagainst any countering. Timing is so important in an attack in development.After anticipating your opponent’s line of attack, you intercept his arm or footand then counter, just as he is about to deliver.LEADING RIGHTThe leading right, like the leading finger jab, is a good defensive punchagainst a swing because your blow doesn’t have to travel too far, as in photo X.Even when the opponent initiates the punch, you can beat him to his delivery.Besides, against a wild swinger or a slow­-moving opponent, you can reallyfrustrate and disturb him with constant blows to his face to keep him fromsetting up a defense.[images/9780897502504_288.jpg][images/9780897502504_289.jpg][images/9780897502504_290.jpg]Against an opponent in the opposite stance, as in photo 1, Lee counters with astraight right lead as the opponent attempts a right swing, as in photo 2. Leestops the attack when his punch makes contact with the face, as in photo 3.Actually, the stop-hit is used to arrest an attack as it is unfold­ing. It canbe an indirect or direct attack. It may be used while the opponent steps forwardto punch or kick, while he is feinting, or while he is moving between acomplicated combination.Against someone standing in the opposite stance, as in photo A, who attempts aswing with his left lead, Lee counters quickly, as in photo B. He counters whenhe sees the opponent draw his hand to launch his attack.Often it is necessary to step or lean forward to employ an effectivestop-hit—beyond the opponent’s focus. Besides, without taking a step, you maynot beat him to the punch.[images/9780897502504_291.jpg]SHIN OR KNEE KICKThe shin or knee low side kick, as in photo X, which is sometimes referred to asthe stop-kick, is one of the most formidable defensive tactics in jeet kune do.If done proficiently, you can stop just about any kind of attack, whether apunch or kick. The concept behind this kick is to beat your opponent to theattack. That means you have to stop your opponent while he is in motion, justbefore he accelerates or just before he attacks. To do that, you must be muchquicker than he is. This trait can be developed by training heavily in thescience of awareness or the art of anticipation.As mentioned earlier, Bruce Lee was always a step ahead of his opponent becauseof his keen, cultivated awareness. He used to practice constantly to increasehis sensitivity of his mobile surroundings.To employ the low side kick against someone standing in the same position, as inphoto 1, Lee studies the opponent’s face to anticipate his first move. As soonas the opponent begins his attack, as in photo 2, Lee sweeps his lead handupward to initiate his momentum. Before his opponent can land his blow, Leeretali­ates with a low side kick to his knee, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_292.jpg]If the opponent is in the opposite stance, as in photo 1, and is planning to usehis rear foot to deliver a front kick, as in photo 2, Lee quickly meets theattack with his lead foot lifted above the floor to intercept the opponent’skicking foot in midair, as in photo 3. You must realize that the stop-kick isnot necessarily a countering blow, but sometimes, it is used strictly to stop orblock an offensive maneuver.An opponent who fights from a crouching position is easier to handle because ofhis limited maneuverability, as in photo A. His low stance and extended feetrestrict him from attacking and retreating quickly. In photo B, Lee just movesaway from the right lead punch thrown by his opponent. Lee was able to move awayeasily from the punch because a low-stance opponent has to telegraph hismovement whenever he tries to stand upright to move forward or backward. Afteravoiding the blow, Lee delivers a crushing shin kick, as in photo C.[images/9780897502504_293.jpg][images/9780897502504_294.jpg][images/9780897502504_295.jpg]Fighting an opponent who stands in the opposite stance, as in photo 1, is notdifferent from someone whose feet are in the same position as yours. It isprobably easier to jam his lead leg because it is aligned with your lead foot.In photo 2, when the opponent lunges, Lee meets the attack directly. Even if theopponent has a head start, Lee’s quick reaction stops the attack frommaterializing, as in photo 3.Against an opponent in close-range, as in photo A, and who stands in theopposite position, Lee evades a left lead punch and simultaneously delivers akick to the lead knee, as in photo B. This is a fairly safe countering movebecause the leg has a longer reach than the hand.[images/9780897502504_296.jpg]SIDE STOP-KICKThe side stop-kick is almost like the low shin and knee kick, except that theformer is employed more devastatingly because the kick is directed at a highertarget, as in photos A and B. The side stop-kick is used not only to stop theattack but also to knock the opponent down.The kick is used extensively because it can be used in medium-distance andfar-distance fighting, and it is the most powerful blow available in jeet kunedo. When delivered properly, you need just one kick to com­pletely stop anopponent.Against an opponent standing in the opposite stance at a lengthy distance, as inphoto 1, Lee is in a secure position and has more time to prepare for an attack,as in photo 2. After studying the opponent’s approach, he moves toward him andunleashes a punishing side kick to his chest, as in photo 3. The impact from thekick not only stops the attack but also drives the opponent back­ward to thefloor, as in photo 4.Proper timing and distance are important in the application of an effectivestop-hit. When the distance is wide, the opponent generally needs some kind ofplanning in his attack. At this mo­ment, you should launch your attack.A smart fighter doesn’t attack until he initially attains control of theopponent’s timing or hand position. He endeavors to draw the stop-hit by anymethod to bring his opponent’s hand and leg within range in order to control it.[images/9780897502504_297.jpg][images/9780897502504_298.jpg]Usually, the stop-hit is employed with a straight thrust or kick, but it may beused during a disengagement, counter-disengagement, or while ducking andslipping.[images/9780897502504_299.jpg][images/9780897502504_300.jpg]From a medium distance, Lee quickly stop-hits an opponent who attempts to kickwith his rear foot, as in photo 1. Once the attack is launched, Lee, without anyhesitation, counters by sliding his rear foot forward and employing a right sidekick to the opponent’s chest, as in photo 2. The hard blow sends the opponentreeling backward, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_301.jpg]Against an onrushing assault from a medium distance, as in photo A, Lee movesinto his opponent as he sees a right swing com­ing. With a quick lunge—not toodeep, as the opponent is closing in—Lee releases a powerful side kick, as inphoto B. The blow stops the attack and drives the opponent backward, as in photoC.[images/9780897502504_302.jpg]A stop-hit is an excellent defense against an opponent who attacks wildly,without any kind of covering, or against an opponent who stands too near.Sometimes you have to angle your body to find the opening and to control theopponent’s hand.Against an opponent in the opposite stance who moves cautiously from a closedistance, as in photo 1, Lee carefully waits for the attack. As soon as hisopponent moves in with a straight left, Lee steps away slightly, just enough toavoid the blow, as in photo 2.Then, Lee quickly shifts his footing and utilizes a right side kick, as in photo3. The kick must be delivered with his body erect or moving forward. Otherwise,there is no force behind it.[images/9780897502504_303.jpg]Another way to score is to use a direct or simple attack when the opponent iswithin distance and doesn’t retreat with his parry. To be certain, hit him whenhe is stepping forward into range, which is when he is transferring his weightforward or when he indicates “weighti­ness” (a slight shift in weight).In another close-range fighting scenario, Lee again waits for the oppo­nent’sinitial action, as in photo A. As soon as the opponent commits himself, Leesteps back slightly, readying both hands against an unexpected blow, as in photoB. Then, he counters with a side kick as he regains his balance, as in photo C.Sometimes it is wise to cause your opponent to stop-hit fully in order toprevent him from recovering against a parry or a counterat­tack. But be aware sohe doesn’t feint a stop-hit and draw you into a trap.HOOK KICKThe hook kick, as in photo A, is one of the fastest and quickest kicks in jeetkune do and is used mainly as an offensive weapon. It can be launched swiftlywithout telegraphing the delivery. It is a good offensive and countering kick.It lacks power, when compared to the side kick, but it can be used veryeffectively. It is targeted at your opponent’s vulnerable spots.[images/9780897502504_304.jpg][images/9780897502504_305.jpg]Against an onrushing attack, as in photo 1, Lee quickly pivots on his rear footand switches his weight to it. He avoids the rush by moving away from the pathof the attack while still maintaining his balance, as in photo 2. Lee stops theattack with a high hook kick to the face, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_306.jpg]Against a cautious opponent who stands from a medium distance, as in photo 1,Lee fakes a right punch to his face, as in photo 2. As the opponent commitshimself with his own straight right punch, Lee parries and, almost in one smoothmotion, seizes the opponent’s right wrist. Then he quickly releases a hook kickto his opponent’s groin, as in photo 3.This sequence of attack is referred to as an attack on completion. After theopponent has lunged, you parry his blow and divert his primary attack. Then youcounter while the opponent’s body is extended in a lunge or during his act ofrecovery—there is no movement of your opponent’s foot during this brief phase.Against someone using a compound preparation whereby he steps forward andemploys his hand simultaneously, economical trapping is useful to eitherimmobilize or create a reaction so you can punch or kick.SPIN KICKThe spin kick, as in photo A, is a surprise countering tactic. It is notrecom­mended as an offensive or attacking weapon. It is a difficult kick tomaster, but once you are adept at using it, it may be your best weapon against askilled opponent.The spin kick should be used sparingly and mostly against an aggressivestraight-line opponent who constantly rushes at you. It is difficult to employagainst a countering and defensive opponent.[images/9780897502504_307.jpg][images/9780897502504_308.jpg]Lee and his opponent stand at a far distance, feeling each other out, as inphoto 1. Suddenly, his opponent rushes forward as Lee prepares to meet theattack, as in photo 2. Lee, a master of the spin kick, delivers a perfect kickto the opponent’s face with ease, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_309.jpg]Standing in the medium distance, Lee faces a cautious opponent, as in photo A.Normally, a spin kick is not the tactic to use here, but Lee applies iteffectively, as in photo B. This may work if the opponent is not wary or is aslow-reacting fighter."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_310.jpg]CHAPTER 16FIVE WAYS OF ATTACK(BY TED WONG)During the later years of his life, Bruce Lee began to teach and make notes oncombative techniques that he called the “Five Ways of Attack.” The techniquesand the nomenclature were heavily influenced by Lee’s research into fencing.Simply put, the five ways of attack are:A: simple angle attack (SAA)B: hand-immobilizing attack (HIA)C: progressive indirect attack (PIA)D: attack by combination (ABC)E: attack by drawing (ABD)SIMPLE ANGLE ATTACKThe SAA, sometimes referred to as the simple attack, has its roots in fencing.The SAA is the most difficult way of attack to master, which is why it is rarelyused. An example of the SAA is the JKD straight lead punch, as in photos 1 and2. The SAA is extremely important because you have to master this movementbefore you can move on to any of the other attacks. The other four ways ofattack are dependent on how well you perform the SAA. In jeet kune do, thestraight lead is the core technique of the art. All other JKD techniques stemfrom the straight lead. Because of the degree of difficulty involved in beingproficient with the straight lead, there is a tendency to ignore its importance,which then leads to a deficiency and segregation in the ability of thepractitioner. Further, if you become proficient in the SAA, then you can scoreany time you move.The SAA is any simple attack thrown at an unexpected angle. It is sometimespreceded by a feint, though the feint is not necessarily considered part of theSAA. The point is to strike your opponent using the most direct route whilecatching him at a moment of vulnerability. The SAA is an attack made up entirelyof timing and speed; the attacker simply hits his opponent before he can responddefensively.All forms of attack, including the SAA, require agile maneuvering because theyare often set up by readjusting the distance with your footwork. With the SAA,there is an even better chance of success if the attack is launched when youropponent is moving his arm away from the line of engagement. This is because heis committed to moving in the opposite direction and must alter his course inorder to defend himself, leaving him vulnerable and potentially off-balance, asin photos A to C.[images/9780897502504_311.jpg][images/9780897502504_312.jpg]HAND-IMMOBILIZING ATTACKThe HIA is performed by trapping your opponent’s head, hair, hand or leg as youstrike through the line of engagement. By trapping or immobilizing a part ofyour opponent’s body, you create a safety zone from which to strike. In otherwords, the HIA forces an opening, as in photos 1 and 2.Immobilization attacks can be set up by using any of the other four ways ofattack and can be performed in combination or alone. Using an HIA at the momentyour opponent intends to deliver a blow requires a keen awareness of youropponent’s intention as well as your own execution of speed and skill. SeeChapter 7 [9780897502504_epub_c07_r1.htm] for more on immobilization techniques.[images/9780897502504_313.jpg][images/9780897502504_314.jpg]PROGRESSIVE INDIRECT ATTACKThe PIA is preceded by a feint or an uncommitted thrust, which is designed tothrow off your opponent’s actions in order to give you time to hit the openingline at the moment of vulnerability. The term “progressive” can be interpretedas “closing distance,” and the term “indirect” can be interpreted as “gainingtime.” The SAA is performed in a single, forward motion without withdrawal, asopposed to the PIA, which is preceded by a feint and consists of two separatemovements.The PIA can be used to simultaneously and effectively bridge the gap and createan opening. The key is for the feint to mask the fact that you are beginning tolunge and, therefore, closing the distance between you and your opponent. Inparticular, if your opponent’s defense is tight, the PIA can be used to forceyour opponent’s hands to move, thereby creating an opening. In order for this tobe effective, a feint or false thrust must appear so real that it convinces youropponent to react, as in photos A to C.[images/9780897502504_315.jpg][images/9780897502504_316.jpg]ATTACK BY COMBINATIONThe ABC is a series of thrusts or strikes that follow each other naturally andare thrown to more than one line. The thrusts are a series of setups designed tomaneuver your opponent into a particular position or create an opening so thatthe final blow in the series will find the vulnerable spot.Triple blows are common in the ABC. The first two blows are used to bring downyour opponent’s guard, opening him up for the final strike. Another version ofthe triple blow is known as the “safety triple.” The safety triple is a seriesof blows, which have as their basis a particular rhythm. In the safety triple,the last blow in the series is aimed in the same location as the first blow; apotential combination would be head-body-head or vice versa, as in photos 1 to3.With the ABC, it is important to be able to change your path at any moment totake into account the reaction of your opponent. This is the difference betweena novice and an expert. The expert fighter makes use of each opportunity as itpresents itself, following up effectively on each opening by creating anotheruntil the final clean shot can be delivered.[images/9780897502504_317.jpg][images/9780897502504_318.jpg]ATTACK BY DRAWINGThe ABD is an attack or counterattack that you initiate by luring your opponentinto an offensive commitment. This trap causes your opponent to think that hehas an apparent opening or to fall into a definitive rhythm and/or pattern thatyou will then intentionally break. The ABD lures your opponent into a falsesense of security and makes him think that he has scored an opening. Youropponent’s commitment to a particular course of action will deprive him of theability to change his course effectively, as in photos A to C.The difference between the PIA and ABD is intention, whether your goal is tocreate an opening (PIA) or to create a counter (ABD). The PIA uses a feint tocreate an opening for a primary attack. The ABD uses a feint to draw a lead,which you would then intercept in a secondary attack. You can use the PIA, orany of the other ways of attack, to set up the ABD. The ABD is more like a chessgame; it is calculated to purposefully make an opening that draws your opponentin for your counterattack.The basic and advanced techniques described in this work can be viewed as thenecessary tools you must hone in order to successfully execute the five ways ofattack. A thorough review of the techniques is recommended for success.[images/9780897502504_319.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_320.jpg]CHAPTER 17ATTRIBUTES AND TACTICSSPEEDA person must have certain attributes to be a skilled fighter. The attributesmay be learned or innate. For instance, speed is an innate trait, but it canalso be developed further. If you are born without speed then you have topractice daily to acquire it. Or if you do have innate speed and want toincrease it, you must train. For more on speed training and specific exercises,see Chapter 5 [9780897502504_epub_c05_r1.htm].There are several different types of speed:A: Perceptual speed is the quickness and ability of your eyes to see an openingthrough the action or inaction of your opponent.B: Mental speed is the ability of your mind to rapidly select the righttechniques to attack or counter against an opponent.C: Per­formance speed is your ability to accelerate your body, feet or handsfrom a starting or set position and continue to increase that speed once yourbody is in motion.D: Initiation speed relies on correct body position and mental preparedness, soyour movements are efficient and direct. Your intention should be direct andwaste no movements. Initiation speed is also based on economy of motion.E: Alteration speed is the ability to change direction quickly in midmotion. Itis the capability to alter your direction while in flight.Speed is a confusing attribute. It comprises several elements, such as yourmobility, springiness or resilience, stamina, and physical and mental alertness(the time needed to recognize an attack and react). The more complex thesituation, the slower you tend to react because it takes your mind a longer timeto figure out what to do.The following aspects are needed to attain greater speed: (1) warming-upexercises to reduce blood viscosity and increase your flexibili­ty; (2) asuitable stance; (3) visual and audio awareness; and (4) quick-reacting habitualpatterns.Visual awareness or keen perceptual speed must be learned through constantpractice because it isn’t inherited. It should be part of your dailytraining—just a short, concentrated practice to perceive rapidly. But thisshould be supplemented with longer training out­side the dojo, as explained inChapter 5 [9780897502504_epub_c05_r1.htm].When your perception is directed on a simple concept or trigger, such as hearinga gun going off or the dropping of a flag, your perceptual speed will becomefaster. You can learn to react almost to your full capacity with a simple actwith practice. In other words, your improvement of your keen awareness canshorten your reaction time.The following reasons can lengthen your reaction time: (1) You are exceptionallyemotional, (2) tired, (3) not trained, or (4) you lack concentration.Choice reaction requires more comprehension and deliberation than simplereaction, which is instinctive, quick and very accu­rate. Like speed, if youhave to concentrate on more than one item or action, your reaction will beslower because each one requires some degree of concentration before you canrespond.During training, you should reduce unnecessary choice reactions and, ifpossible, present your opponent with a variety of probable responses, forcinghim into a slower, choice-reaction position.Your opponent’s reaction time is lengthened when the visual-awareness stimuliare combined—such as when an opponent inhales, when he has just completed histechnique, when his attention or perception is distracted, and when he isoff-balance.A person who is slow in responding to and delivering attacks can over­come thisdisadvantage through quick perception. An offensive fighter, who can use onlyhis right foot and right hand extensively, should learn to use both hands andboth feet. Displaying a one-sided offense allows your opponent to have theadvantage because he knows that your attacks will be limited primarily to oneside.[images/9780897502504_321.jpg]In photos 1 and 2, perceptual speed, initiation speed and performance speed areillustrated. Both the person striking and the person holding the mitt playactive roles in practicing their speed training. The person holding the mitt ispracticing his perceptual speed (the quickness of his eyes to perceive themotion of his opponent) and his initiation speed (the ability tonontelegraphically strike or counter his opponent simply and directly). Theperson striking is practicing his performance speed (the ability to bridge thegap, i.e. contract his muscles and move from a set position quickly to cover thedistance) as well as his initiation speed.TIMINGWorking in concert with speed is the principle of timing. Timing means theability to recognize the right moment and seize the opportunity for action. Thisperfect moment may be either seized instinctively or provoked consciously. Thereare several instances when a hit may be made before, during or after youropponent’s actions.A hit may be made as your opponent is preparing or planning to move, as inphotos A and B. Before a movement, you may notice your opponent’s concentrationflagging, or that he is not paying close attention. This is an opportune time tostrike and catch him off-guard. You should always engage your keen awareness soas to instinctively intercept your opponent’s intention or lack of concentrationas an opportunity you can exploit to your benefit.[images/9780897502504_322.jpg][images/9780897502504_323.jpg][images/9780897502504_324.jpg]A hit may also land when your opponent is in the middle of a movement, as inphotos 1 to 4. During your opponent’s attack is the key time to intercept hismovement and strike. When your opponent is fully committed to an offensivestrike, he is not generally able to counter successfully.[images/9780897502504_325.jpg]A hit may also land after your opponent’s attack is foiled or spent as in photosA to E. The timing here is to attack while your opponent is extended into alunge or during his act of recovery. During recovery, your opponent is not athis full capacity to defend, so this is an opportune time to strike.ATTITUDEAn athlete with a winning attitude is self-confident and re­laxed. He feels incommand of a situation, but he may also experience the physical effects ofnervousness (“butterflies in the stomach”), such as nausea or vomiting beforethe event. This condition is quite natural among novices as well as manyexperienced athletes.Once the confident athlete is in the ring or on the field, he is able to controlhis emotions and perform at his highest peak. But a novice or a cham­pion who isso intent on winning may continue to be so tense that his muscles begin to workagainst him. He becomes stiff and his motion becomes awkward.A fighter must not take a lackadaisical attitude toward a fight. He should learnto compete and practice at full speed continuously and not just performmoderately with the idea that he can increase his tempo at any time. A realcompetitor trains and competes at top capaci­ty—harder and faster than normallyrequired. He develops a good mental attitude.Experience sometimes shows that an athlete can perform up to this capaci­ty aslong as needed. His latent energy (“second wind”) does come into play if heperforms at his limit.But the experienced and older athletes do not waste their ener­gy either. Agreat athlete conserves his energy by using his skills more effectively. Heemploys fewer wasteful motions through economy of motion.To improve his performance, momentum should be used at a mini­mum, especially ifit takes great muscular effort. Instead, momentum should be utilized to overcomeresistance. You should understand that curved motions demand less effort thanstraight-line movements, such as when your direction has to change suddenly andsharply.You must understand that it is a natural tendency to over-mobilize or overexertyour effort when confronted with an un­familiar task. You should train with aneasy and natural rhythm so your performance will be smooth and automatic. Whenyour initiating muscles are not restricted, your movements will be more accurateand easy.Becoming a champion requires a good mental attitude toward preparation. You haveto accept the most tedious task with plea­sure. The better prepared you are torespond to a stimulus, the more satisfaction you will find in the response. Theless prepared, the more irritated you will feel when you have to perform.TACTICSA fighter can be classified either as a mechanical or an intelli­gent fighter.The mechanical fighter fights in a similar pattern in each encounter. Hisstrikes are repetitious and automatic.An intelligent fighter will alter his tactics in order to use the right strikes,depending on his opponent’s technique and the way he fights. He approaches eachencounter with a strategy based on preliminary analysis, preparation andexecution.The preliminary analysis is made during the initial encounter. It consists ofstudying your opponent’s habits, weaknesses and strengths. Is he aggressive oris he defensive? What are his dominant of­fenses and defenses? You may have touse false attacks to compel him to reveal his speed, reaction and skill.Preparation comes after understanding your opponent’s fighting ability. You nowhave at least a plan to outwit your opponent, taking advantage of his weakness.If you are planning to take the offensive, you must control the situation. Youmay mislead him with false attacks, followed by real attacks, by varying yourattacks to keep your opponent confused and occupied so he can’t assume theinitiative. You must be prepared to parry if your oppo­nent attempts a surprisestop-hit or counter.Although the preparation and attack form one smooth motion, they should reallybe two separate movements to prepare you against a possible counterattack.You should be able to halt rapidly and effortlessly when ad­vancing for thepreparation needed for an attack. Pay close attention to your balance and footmovement. Short, rapid steps are easier to con­trol than lengthy ones.Often, especially in close fighting, you can attack on the prepa­ration orarrest of your opponent’s motion before he can make his plan materialize. Thisgenerally includes some movements to deflect the opponent’s lead or cause areaction for an opening when the feints fail. It also allows a change ofdistance.An attack by preparation can also be applied against an opponent who maintainsan accurate distance and thereby is difficult to reach because he secures hisposition by staying constantly out of the attacking range. To reach him, youhave to draw him into range by taking a short step back.If you repeat an attack by preparation too often, it will attract a stop-hitrather than a parry. So initiate it with great economy, eliminating orshortening the time of vulnerability by just opening­ the lines enough to trap.Practice preparations during engage­ment, change of engagement, and feints onyour partner.Execution of your real attack demands surprise, quickness, fluidity and goodtiming. Your thoughts must be decisive, alert and pragmatic. If your opponentseizes the initiative, you may regain it by disturbing his concentration throughthe constant threat of counterattacking by attacking his outside line, or bybeating his guard.Tactics are the ability to think a step ahead of your opponent. This requiresgood judgment, the ability to see the openings, a skill in anticipation and“guts.” Mechanical ability is a must in order to carry out your strategy. Butmechanical perfection alone does not ensure success. You must be able to useyour technical ability to intelli­gently analyze your opponent.A good fighter first controls his distance with superior footwork and then hecontinues to lead the opponent’s rhythm with feints, false attacks and short buteffective hitting.Learn to use your own rhythm to confuse your opponent, then surprise him with aburst of quickness. Another effective method is to use the broken-time attack,which is a slight pause just before the impact. This will disrupt the opponent’sdefense.A novice’s rhythm, likewise, may be hard to judge because of its irregularity. Abeginner also may not be able to follow your lead. He may panic and parry toosoon, in the form of an uncontrolled whip with no direction, and accidentallycatch your arm. To avoid this, learn to be patient and only use simple or directattacks swiftly when there is an opening. Refrain from using com­pound attacks.A novice’s irregular rhythm may come as a broken-rhythm at­tack unintentionallyand may even fool more skilled fighters who do not expect such a rhythm. In sucha case, keep your distance and let your clumsy opponent overreach beforecounter­ing.A clever fighter does not fight the same way against all his opponents. Hevaries his tactics with direct and complex attacks and counters. He also altershis distance and position against each opponent.One rule is not to use complicated techniques unless they are necessary toachieve your goal. First, use simple movements, and if they don’t work,introduce more complex ones. Simple attacks from the on-guard position willoften catch your opponent off-guard, especially after a series of false attacksand feints. The defender expects a complex action or a preparation and is notready for the swift and nontelegraphic blow. To connect against a good fighterwith a combination is gratifying and reveals your knowledge of techniques, butto hit him with a simple and direct blow shows great proficiency in yourability.Half of your fight is won if you know what your opponent is doing. Against acalm, patient fighter who protects himself well in the ready position, whoavoids any preparation and who stays out of range, do not attack directly. Sucha fighter is normal­ly well-versed in stop-hitting and stop-kicking. Againstsuch a fighter, draw his stop-hit with good feints, then retaliate with trappingor grappling. Your feints should be longer.But against a nervous fighter, your feint should be shorter. You should agitatea nervous fighter but remain relaxed against both the nervous and calm fighters.A shorter man has the inclination to attack the advanced targets to overcome hisshorter reach. He prefers close fighting if he is stronger. Against such anopponent, fight without moving closer or extending your on-guard position todisturb and restrict his strate­gy.A tall fighter is usually slower but has a longer reach that can do damage.Against such a fighter, keep a safe distance until you can close in. Also keepyour distance against a fighter who con­tinues to use renewed attacks or keepson advancing. But do not constantly step back on the attacks, as this is what hewants you to do. Instead, step forward into his attack to unbal­ance hismaneuver.It is important that you always reverse the tactics used by your opponent. Forinstance, use counters against an opponent who likes to use stop-hits and usestop-hits against an opponent who uses feints. Box a fighter and fight a boxer.But, ironically, it is not smart to constantly attack a defensive opponent.Awkward fighters use exaggerated and unexpected movements. Against such afighter, stand at a distance and parry at the last instant. Because his attacksare simple and direct, your most effec­tive weapon is a stop-hit or a timed hit.Use a renewed attack with a quick lunge on an opponent who has the tendency towithdraw his hand or foot when a blow is launched toward it. Often, a series ofhigh feints will open the low-line areas, especially around the knee and shin.During real combat, keep your eyes glued on your opponent. In close fighting,watch his lower line to protect your face, and in long-range fighting, watch hiseyes. Keep him on the defensive and keep him guessing. Strike from all anglesand press him once you have him in trouble. Draw him to step forward, and whenhe does, attack him. Concentrate your attacks on his weaknesses and make himfight “your fight,” not his.The difference between an amateur and an expert is that an expert can quicklyperceive and seize an opportunity. He makes use of his arsenal and intelligence,delivering punches and kicks in a well thought out manner, creating openingafter opening until he delivers a powerful, damaging blow."},{"pageContent":"PART IVSELF-DEFENSE TECHNIQUES"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_326.jpg]CHAPTER 18DEFENSE AGAINST A SURPRISE ATTACKThe best defense against a surprise attack is not to be surprised. In otherwords, Bruce Lee always emphasized that a martial artist must constantly beaware of his surroundings. He must train to be cautious and alert at all times.He should never be caught napping before an attack.In the following segments of self-defense, you will quickly notice that most ofthe attacks against Lee are prevented because of his alertness.Lee attempted here to re-enact realistic scenarios that could occur in anyone’sdaily life. He always believed that the best defense is to be quicker than yourassailant.But to do this, you must practice constantly. All techniques must be donefluidly and with power and swiftness.[images/9780897502504_327.jpg]ATTACK FROM THE SIDEWalking down the street, Lee notices someone standing at the corner, as in photo1. Instead of walking near him, Lee leaves enough room to defend against anam­bush, as in photo 2. As the assail­ant attacks, as in photo 3, Lee counterswith a quick and power­ful side kick to the forward knee, as in photo 4. Thekick is followed through completely so it causes the assailant to reel backward,as in photos 5. Lee counterattacks with multiple hooks and straight punches tothe face, as in photo 6, keeping the assailant off-balance.[images/9780897502504_328.jpg]Note: You have to constantly practice the side kick on a heavy bag—preferablyabout 70 pounds—to develop good power. Notice that Lee delivers his kick whilekeeping his body away from the assailant.[images/9780897502504_329.jpg]ATTACK WHILE ENTERING A CARAs Lee attempts to enter his car, he is aware of the assailant, as in photo 1.As the assailant attempts to kick, Lee surprises him by countering with a sidekick to the knee, as in photos 2 and 3. The kick drops the assailant to theground, as in photos 4 and 5. Lee follows up with a hook kick to the head, as inphoto 6.[images/9780897502504_330.jpg]Note: It seems that the assailant has the advantage over Lee, but anyone who hasseen Lee perform knows how fast he was. Lee is able to counter with a kickbecause his movement is fluid and quick. To be this quick, you have to practicekicking the air or hitting a light bag. Don’t kick hard while practicing thisbecause you may hurt your knees. Solid kicks should be done on a heavy bag.[images/9780897502504_331.jpg]AMBUSH FROM THE REARThe assailant follows Lee, as in photos 1 to 3, but Lee is aware of him andpretends he doesn’t see him. Before the assailant can throw a punch, Leecounters with a side or back kick to the assailant’s knee, knocking himbackward, as in photos 4 to 6. Lee follows up by turning to execute a groinkick, as in photos 7 and 8.[images/9780897502504_332.jpg]Note: If Lee had turned around to face the assailant, he would have given theassailant the added advantage of preparing for his attack. By being wary andpretending to be unaware, Lee allows himself this added advantage instead.[images/9780897502504_333.jpg]AMBUSH AT CLOSE QUARTERSAs Lee prepares to enter his car, the assailant rushes toward him and attemptsto kick his midsection, as in photos 1 and 2. Lee steps back, as in photo 3. Assoon as the assailant places his foot down, as in photo 4, Lee executes a sidekick to the back of the assailant’s knee, as in photos 5 and 6. He quicklyfollows up with a choke hold, as in photos 7 and 8.[images/9780897502504_334.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_335.jpg]CHAPTER 19DEFENSE AGAINST AN UNARMED ASSAILANTBruce Lee demonstrates how to handle several different forms of assault in thischapter. For years, he kept saying that you are wasting a lot of energy and evenmaking yourself less effective by studying “set patterns” (kata). To him,“fighting is simple and total.”In this chapter, some of the approaches by the attacker may seem irrational.But, as Lee himself said, “There are many irrational people on the streetstoday.”[images/9780897502504_336.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CROUCHING ATTACKThe assailant approaches Lee in a crouch, which is an unusual way of attacking,as in photo 1. From a southpaw stance, Lee delivers a side kick to the side ofthe forward knee, causing the assailant to drop, as in photos 2 to 4. Lee thenfollows through by dragging the assailant backward by his shirt collar andfinishes him off with a heel stomp to the face, as in photos 5 to 8.[images/9780897502504_337.jpg]Note: Lee includes this scenario in his self-defense series because some schoolsof martial arts do not prepare students for situations like this. Besides, someschools teach their students to stop after the opponent is down, but Lee alwaysbelieved that, because the assailant is trying to maim or kill you, you have tobe sure he can’t retaliate.[images/9780897502504_338.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A REVERSE PUNCHIn this bird’s-eye view, Lee shows how an attack can be nullified by a sim­plemaneuver. As the assailant moves for­ward to attempt a right punch, as in photos1 and 2, Lee delivers a side kick to his groin, as in photo 3, with his forwardfoot.Note: Many karate schools teach their students to block once or several timesbefore countering. Lee believed that it is more effec­tive to counterimmediately, as he has done here. But to do this, you must be quicker than theattacker.[images/9780897502504_339.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A FULL SWINGAgainst a full swing, as in photo A, Lee has more time to counter because theassailant clearly telegraphs his movement. Before the punch can reach him, Leeputs his weight on his rear leg and exe­cutes a side kick to the chest, as inphotos B and C.[images/9780897502504_340.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HOOK PUNCH, NO. 1In this view from above, as in photos 1 and 2, we see the assailant attack Leewith an attempted right hook. Lee parries the strike to the side of his head andimmediately follows up with a finger jab to the eyes, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_341.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HOOK PUNCH, NO. 2As the assailant attempts a right hook, as in photo A, Lee rotates his hipsclock­wise, quickly placing his weight evenly on both feet, as in photo B, andexecutes a finger jab to the eyes without blocking the at­tack, as in photo C.Lee’s striking hand and change of position cause the assailant’s punch to missits mark.[images/9780897502504_342.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HOOK PUNCH, NO. 3As the assailant attempts a right hook, as in photos 1 and 2, Lee rotates hiship, placing most of his weight on his rear foot. Then he counters with a sidekick to the groin, as in photos 3 and 4, using his forward foot.Note: When defending against a roundhouse punch, Lee has more time to reactbecause the blow is tele­graphed, which means he can counter with a side kick bystepping away from the strike before delivering the kick. In the defensesagainst the hook punch (No. 1 and No. 2), Lee did two variations of thefinger-jab counterattack. He personally preferred the second finger jab (seepage 381) because of the principle behind economy of movement. (This is the wingchun “inner gate” jab, which can be seen on page 124 of Wing Chun by J. YimmLee.)[images/9780897502504_343.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A TACKLE, NO. 1Like the full-swing attack, Lee has more time to counter against someone who istrying to tackle him, as in photos A to C. As the assailant at­tempts to tacklehim, he steps back and delivers a front kick to his face.[images/9780897502504_344.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A TACKLE, NO. 2As the assailant attempts to tackle him, as in photos 1 and 2, Lee just stepsback, grabs the as­sailant’s hair and hand, and pulls him to the ground, as inphotos 3 to 5. Lee then uses the at­tacker’s own momentum to turn him over, asin photos 6 to 8, so he can stomp on his face, as in photo 9.Note: Lee always believed that self-defense means that you do anything to getout of a situation or use any way to defend your­self. He normally would nothave used the hair tactic in a real fight, but it can be effective in certainsituations.[images/9780897502504_345.jpg][images/9780897502504_346.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A TACKLE, NO. 3As the assailant attacks, the defender slides his rear foot back slightly tobrace himself, as in photos 1 and 2. The defender grabs the assailant’s neck ina head lock as he comes toward him, as in photos 3 and 4. The defender slideshis front foot backward and pins the assailant to the ground while maintaining achoke hold, as in photos 5 and 6. He must execute the pin quickly or theattacker could strike his groin.[images/9780897502504_347.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_348.jpg]CHAPTER 20DEFENSE AGAINST GRABBINGWhen an assailant grabs you, he usually has the jump on you. But it doesn’t meanhe has the advantage because he doesn’t know how you will retaliate.When you are seized at close quarters, your hands are your most practicaldefense. You are too close to deliver an effective kick. But a kick can bedelivered if the assailant leaves enough distance between you and him. Forinstance, if he grabs your wrist, you have room to execute a shin or knee kick.[images/9780897502504_349.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CHEST GRABThe assailant seizes Lee’s chest with his left hand, as in photo 1, and attemptsto knee Lee’s groin, as in photo 2. Lee blocks the assailant’s knee with hisleft hand, and in one motion grabs the assailant’s left hand while executing aright bottom-fist strike to his groin, as in photos 3 and 4. He then thrusts hisleft hand into the assailant’s throat, as in photo 5, and shoves him backward tothe ground, as in photos 6 and 7. Lee jumps, as in photo 8, and executes awell-timed stomp on the assailant’s face, as in photo 9.Note: You have to practice this technique over and over again to do itef­fectively because there are so many movements involved. In photos 5 to 7, youcannot take your assailant down unless you use one hand to shove his throatwhile your other hand is used as a lever—grabbing his sleeve and pulling itclockwise and downward.[images/9780897502504_350.jpg][images/9780897502504_351.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST AN ARM GRAB, NO. 1With both hands, the assailant grabs Lee’s arm, as in photo 1. Lee quickly faceshim, as in photo 2, and delivers an inverted low stomp to the knee, as in photo3, followed by a punch to the face, as in photo 4. Lee finishes with a leftfront kick to the groin, as in photo 5.[images/9780897502504_352.jpg][images/9780897502504_353.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST AN ARM GRAB, NO. 2The assailant grabs Lee’s arm with both hands, as in photo 1. Without anyunnecessary motion, Lee delivers a side kick to the assailant’s knee, as inphotos 2 and 3.[images/9780897502504_354.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST AN ARM GRAB, NO. 3The assailant grabs Lee’s right wrist, as in photo A. Before the assailant canthrow his punch, Lee counters with a left cross, as in photo B.Note: Sometimes a martial arts instruc­tor teaches his students several motionsto dis­pose of an assailant when instead it can be done with just a simple blow,as the above sequence shows.[images/9780897502504_355.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BELT HOLDThe assailant grabs Lee’s belt and pulls Lee toward him, as in photo 1. Becausehe is too close to perform a kicking technique, Lee leans away from theattacker’s punch and simultaneously executes a finger jab to the eyes, as inphoto 2.[images/9780897502504_356.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A WRIST LOCKThe assailant uses a wrist lock on Lee with both hands, as in photo A. Leequickly turns clockwise, as in photo B, and executes a reverse el­bow strike, asin photo C.Note: Lee al­ways emphasized that you shouldn’t turn your back on your opponent,but in this case, it is done quickly enough to be effective without leaving youvulnerable.[images/9780897502504_357.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HALF NELSONAttacking Lee from behind, the assail­ant locks his right arm and keeps his headin a grip, as in photos 1 and 2. Using the attack’s momentum, Lee turns his bodyaway from his locked arm (counter­clockwise), as in photo 3, forcing theassailant off-balance, as in photo 4. Keeping the assail­ant’s arm locked underhis body, as in photo 5, Lee delivers a re­verse elbow strike, as in photo 6.[images/9780897502504_358.jpg][images/9780897502504_359.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A REVERSE WRIST LOCKThe assailant puts a reverse wrist lock on Lee’s right hand, as in photos 1 and2. Lee retaliates with a side kick to his midsection, as in photo 3, and a spinkick to the same area with the other foot, as in photos 4 and 5.Note: When someone grabs you with a reverse lock, as in photos 2 and 3, you haveto quickly counter before he can pin you to the ground.[images/9780897502504_360.jpg][images/9780897502504_361.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A TWO-HAND CHEST GRAB, NO. 1The assailant grabs the front of Lee’s shirt with both hands, as in photo 1.Note that Lee uses his left hand to protect his groin. Lee then lifts the samehand to lock his assail­ant’s arm while simultaneously executing a right crossto his face, as in photo 2.[images/9780897502504_362.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A TWO-HAND CHEST GRAB, NO. 2The assailant grabs the front of Lee’s shirt with both hands, as in photo A.Note that Lee uses his left hand to protect his groin. Lee then lifts the samehand to lock his assail­ant’s arm. He follows with a forward elbow strike to thehelpless assailant’s face, as in photo B.Note: The important maneuver in this technique and the technique before (No. 1)is to trap the assailant’s right hand and attack before he can do any damage toyou.[images/9780897502504_363.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A SHOULDER GRAB FROM THE REARThe assailant grabs Lee’s shoulder from the rear, as in photo X. Lee turns historso and applies a backfist to the assail­ant’s face, as in photos Y and Z.Note: To have power in your backfist, you have to step back slightly and rotateyour hip while simultaneously applying the punch.[images/9780897502504_364.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A ONE-HAND CHEST GRABThe assailant grabs Lee’s chest with his left hand and delivers a right swing toLee’s face, as in photos 1 and 1A. Lee doesn’t bother to block it but insteadapplies a straight inner-fin­ger jab to the assailant’s eyes, as in photos 2 and2A. He follows up by immobilizing the assailant’s hand and simultaneouslyhitting him with a right uppercut, as in photos 3 and 3A.Note: Performing a finger jab simultaneously against a swing looks easy but itisn’t. You have to practice this constantly to get it right. This techniquecomes from wing chun kung fu. (See page 124 of Wing Chun by J. Yimm Lee.)[images/9780897502504_365.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HIGH REVERSE WRIST LOCKThe assailant applies a high reverse wrist lock to the defender’s left hand, asin photos 1 and 2. The defender turns clockwise and executes a back kick, as inphotos 3 and 4.[images/9780897502504_366.jpg]Note: It isn’t common for someone to catch you in a reverse wrist lock, but incase it does happen, you should be ready.[images/9780897502504_367.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BACK ARM LOCKThe assailant grabs the defender with a rear arm lock that is difficult to getout of, as in photo 1. The quickest way to escape is to execute a back kick tohis groin, as in photo 2.Note: Sometimes a knowledgeable assailant will place his foot and body so closeto you that you can’t retaliate with a kick. In a case like that, you can alwaysmaneuver your body so there’s enough space to deliver it.[images/9780897502504_368.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CHEST GRAB AND A PUNCHThe assailant grabs the front of the defender’s shirt and attempts to punch hisface, as in photo A. The defender grabs the assailant’s wrist with his left handand, at the same time, de­livers a punch to the assailant’s jaw, as in photo B.He follows up with a foot sweep, as in photos C to E.Note: Instead of a punch to the assailant’s jaw, a finger jab will be just asef­fective. After dropping the assailant, you can then strike him with your handor foot."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_369.jpg]CHAPTER 21DEFENSE AGAINST CHOKE HOLDS AND HUGSA good martial artist is always alert and should never be surprised. Thefollowing self-defense techniques apply to situations in which you are surprisedand must free yourself from a choke hold or a hug.Bruce Lee always explained that the best defense is the most simple andeffective—especially against a choke hold. Lee demon­strates how you can escapeand retaliate through direct and simple counters.In this section, he also demonstrates the use of elbows and strikes that targetthe groin.[images/9780897502504_370.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A FRONT CHOKE, NO. 1The assailant chokes Lee, so he seizes the assailant’s wrist to relieve thepressure on his neck, as in photo 1. Maintaining his safety grip with one hand,Lee quickly finger jabs the assailant’s eyes, as in photos 2 and 3. He thenfollows up with a knee strike to the assailant’s groin, as in photos 4 and 5.Note: Lee doesn’t waste time in his action here. Instead of trying to break thegrip first, he counters directly. Notice that Lee’s right foot is touching theassailant’s right foot. This is to prevent the assailant from kicking or kneeinghim.[images/9780897502504_371.jpg][images/9780897502504_372.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A FRONT CHOKE, NO. 2The assailant chokes Lee and drives him against the wall, as in photo 1. Leesteps out to the side and delivers a front kick to his groin, as in photo 2.Note: As the assailant chokes him, Lee is able to get out of the choke and moveslightly back far enough to do a front kick.[images/9780897502504_373.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HEAD LOCK, NO. 1The assailant has Lee in a head lock, as in photos A and B. Lee quicklyretaliates with a finger jab to the assailant’s eyes, using his free hand, as inphoto C.[images/9780897502504_374.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HEAD LOCK, NO. 2The assailant has Lee in a head lock, as in photo 1. Lee is able to place hisright hand over the assailant’s shoulder and claw at his face, as in photos 2and 3.[images/9780897502504_375.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A HEAD LOCK, NO. 3The assailant has Lee in a head lock, as in photo A. Lee turns his body in closeto the assailant and, with his free hand, as in photo B, pounds at theassailant’s groin, as in photo C.Note: Whenever you are caught in a head lock, you must act fast with a counteror else the assailant will drag you to the ground, making it harder to freeyourself.[images/9780897502504_376.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A REAR STRANGLEHOLDThe assailant strangles Lee from the rear and also seizes his right hand, as inphoto 1. Lee moves slight­ly to his right and applies a left elbow strike to theassailant’s ribs, as in photo 2.Note: The assailant is trying to strangle Lee and bend his body backward, butbefore he is put in a vulnera­ble position, Lee moves to the right and has aclean shot at the assailant’s exposed rib area.[images/9780897502504_377.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BEAR HUG (ARMS PINNED)The assailant has Lee in a bear hug, as in photo A. To get out of this, Leesteps his right foot out, drops his weight down slightly to loosen theassailant’s grip, and executes a left-hand strike to his groin, as in photo B.Note: This maneu­ver requires constant practice because there are severalcoordinated moves you have to do in a split second. This is especially true ifthe assailant is a strong person.[images/9780897502504_378.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BEAR HUG (ARMS FREE)The assailant has Lee in a bear hug, but his arms are free, as in photo 1.Instead of attempting to free himself from the grip, Lee just delivers a reverseelbow strike to the assailant’s face, as in photo 2.Note: When delivering the blow with your elbow, rotate your hip for added power.[images/9780897502504_379.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A LIFTING FRONT BEAR HUGThe assailant grabs the defender from the front and lifts him off his feet, asin photo A. The defender swings his foot back and de­livers an upward kneestrike to the as­sailant’s groin, as in photos B to D.[images/9780897502504_380.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A LIFTING REAR BEAR HUGThe assailant grabs the defender from the rear and lifts him off his feet, as inphoto 1. The defender swings his head back and bangs it against the assailant’sface, as in photo 2.Note: To defend against the front bear hug, you have a second or third chance tostrike even if you miss the groin because the assailant can’t do anything to youas long as he keeps hugging you. For the rear bear hug, you take a risk ofgetting your head cut open, but the assailant will sustain injuries, as well.[images/9780897502504_381.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A FRONT HEAD LOCKThe assailant has the defender in a front head lock, as in photo A. Before hecan drop him to the ground, the defender takes aim and punches the assailant’sgroin, as in photo B.Note: Sometimes in close-­quarters fighting, you can end up in a head lock. Themost important thing to do is to counter quickly so you are not pinned to theground."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_382.jpg]CHAPTER 22DEFENSE AGAINST AN ARMED ASSAILANTDefending against an unarmed assailant is quite different from facing someonewith a knife or gun. If you practice self-defense against someone using a toyweapon or a facsimile of a weapon, you might perform a technique withproficiency. But if you face a real gun or knife for the first time, you’llprobably have chills down your back or even freeze up, especially when you knowthat one slip-up could mean death.Only constant practice can give you a feeling of comfort or confidence, butpractice does not represent the conditions of the street. Going against a clubor staff is not as frightening as going against a real dagger or gun.The most dangerous weapon, naturally, is the gun. An assailant wielding a club,knife or staff will telegraph his movement, but with a gun, just a littlesqueeze of the trigger is all you’re going to notice.Bruce Lee demonstrates some techniques against an armed assailant, but he alwaysemphasized, “You are at a disadvantage against someone with a weapon, so keepaway from him.”[images/9780897502504_383.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CLUB, NO. 1The swings a club at Lee, as in photos 1 and 2. Stepping back just enough to letthe club miss him, as in photo 3, Lee retaliates with a side kick to theassailant’s body, as in photos 4 and 5.[images/9780897502504_384.jpg][images/9780897502504_385.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CLUB, NO. 2The assailant swings his club at Lee, as in photo 1, who ducks under the blow,as in photo 2. Lee then grabs the assailant’s sleeve, as in photo 3, forcing himdownward. He then immediately counters with a knee to the face, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_386.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A CLUB, NO. 3The assailant, with both hands on a club, jabs at Lee’s midsection, as in photoA. Lee blocks the jab and moves his hips to the side before applying a fingerjab to the assail­ant’s eyes, as in photo B.Note: Against a club or a lead pipe, you must have good timing and know yourdistance. One slip-up might leave you in grave danger, and you are not given asecond chance in most instances. Practice is everything.[images/9780897502504_387.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF: JAMMINGIn photo 1, the assailant attempts to swing a staff at Lee. Lee moves swiftlytoward the assailant, as in photo 2, and jams the assailant’s arm with his lefthand while punching at the assailant’s body with his right, as in photo 3.Holding the as­sailant’s arm, as in photo 4, Lee applies a foot sweep to theankle that causes the as­sailant to fall, as in photo 5. Lee punches him as hefalls, as in photo 6, and finishes him off with a rib stomp, as in photos 7 and8.[images/9780897502504_388.jpg][images/9780897502504_389.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF: DUCKINGThe assailant swings the staff toward Lee, as in photo 1, and Lee quickly ducksunderneath it, as in photos 2 and 3. As soon as the staff passes over his head,Lee quickly counters with a roundhouse kick to assailant’s groin, as in photos 4and 5.[images/9780897502504_390.jpg][images/9780897502504_391.jpg][images/9780897502504_392.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF: ELUDING, NO. 1In photo 1, the assailant swings a staff at Lee, who moves back just enough toelude the blow, as in photo 2. As soon as the blow passes him, Lee moves inquickly with a high reverse hook kick to the assailant’s head, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_393.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF: ELUDING, NO. 2In photos 1 to 3, the assailant swings the staff at Lee, who moves back to eludethe blow. As soon as the blow passes him, as in photo 4, Lee jumps in swiftlyand applies a reverse hook or sweep kick to the assailant’s face, as in photos 5and 6.[images/9780897502504_394.jpg][images/9780897502504_395.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF THRUST, NO. 1The assailant thrusts the staff at Lee’s midsection, as in photo 1. Leesidesteps and seizes the staff, as in photo 2. He follows up with a side kick tothe assailant’s chest while still holding the staff, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_396.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A STAFF THRUST, NO. 2In photo A, the assailant thrusts a staff at Lee’s midsection. Lee side­stepsand seizes the staff, as in photo B. He then applies a front kick to theassailant’s arm, as in photo C.Note: Against a staff or bo, you have two advantages: The assailant cannot hidehis weapon, and he telegraphs his movement more so than with a club or knife.The disadvantage is that he has a longer reach and can hit you from fartheraway. It is very impor­tant that you do not mis­judge in closing the distance.Timing is also important in defending against a staff.[images/9780897502504_397.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A KNIFE: GRAB AND STABThe assailant grabs Lee’s shirt, as in photo 1, and attempts to stab him with aknife, as in photo 2. Lee quickly seizes the assailant’s left hand and swingshis right arm into the assailant’s el­bow, as in photo 3. In photo 4, Lee alsosimultaneously trips him with a right foot sweep. As soon as the as­sailantfalls to the ground, as in photo 5, Lee follows up with a crushing foot thrustto the assailant’s body, as in photo 6.[images/9780897502504_398.jpg][images/9780897502504_399.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A KNIFE THRUST, NO. 1In photo 1, Lee faces an assailant with a knife. Before he attacks, Lee fakes afinger jab to the assailant’s face, which causes him to react, as in photo 2. Atthat instant, Lee kicks him in the ankle, leaving enough space be­tween theassailant and himself to apply the kick, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_400.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A KNIFE THRUST, NO. 2The assailant ap­proaches Lee with a knife, as in photo A. Lee applies acrescent kick to the as­sailant’s wrist, as in photo B, causing him to drop theknife, as in photo C.[images/9780897502504_401.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A KNIFE SWINGThe defender is face to face with an assailant wielding a knife, as in photo 1.When the assailant swings the knife at him, the defender quickly evades theas­sault by stepping back, as in photo 2. The instant the defender sees anopening after the knife passes by him, as in photo 3, he moves forward andapplies a side kick to the back of the assailant’s knee, forcing him to theground, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_402.jpg]Note: Facing a person with a knife is quite frightening unless you have mentallyprepared for this type of situation. If you haven’t, you should start rightaway. If you meet someone with a knife some­day, you don’t want to freeze upduring that moment.Caution: Always avoid an encounter with an armed person if you possibly can.[images/9780897502504_403.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A GUN: FRONTThe assailant holds a gun on Lee, as in photo 1. In photo 2, Lee reacts quicklyby stepping forward, twisting his hip and simultaneously parrying and seizingthe assailant’s wrist so Lee is not in the line of fire. With his free hand, Leeattacks the assailant’s throat, as in photo 3, and then he slides his hand downalong the assailant’s arm until he seizes the assailant’s wrist and follows itup with a left backfist, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_404.jpg][images/9780897502504_405.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A GUN: REARThe assailant points a gun at Lee’s back, as in photo 1. Lee retaliates byturning his body counterclockwise and using his arm to parry the assailant’shand and move himself out of the line of fire, as in photo 2. In photo 3, Leeseizes the assailant’s wrist and attacks the assailant’s throat with his freehand. He follows up with multiple blows to the head, as in photo 4.[images/9780897502504_406.jpg]Note: As mentioned before, taking a gun away from a person is very risky.There’s no way to take away a gun from an attacker from a distance. Before youcould even reach the assailant, he only has to squeeze the trigger. The onlychance you’ll ever have against a gun is at close quarters. Even then, it’sdifficult, and you can’t make any mistakes because there will be no secondchance."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_407.jpg]CHAPTER 23DEFENSE AGAINST MULTIPLE ASSAILANTSIf attacked by two or more assailants, then you may be at a real disadvantageunless you are better prepared for fighting than they are. Although Bruce Leeexplained that he uses the unorthodox (southpaw) stance while fighting so he candepend mostly on his right foot and hand, you must be able to use both your leftand right limbs proficiently against multiple assailants.Naturally, defending against multiple assailants is harder than against anindividual because you have to be cognizant of all your assailants’ positions.If you are pinned by two or more individuals, the odds of freeing yourself areheavily against you. Their combined strength and weight might be twice as muchas yours.[images/9780897502504_408.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A REAR AND FRONT ATTACKAssailant A pins Lee’s left hand behind his back and holds his shirt from therear, as in photo 1. Assailant B throws a right punch to Lee’s face, as in photo2. In photo 3, Lee ducks the blow, whirls toward his right—freeing his arm fromassailant A—and applies a backfist to A’s ribs. He then finger jabs assailantB’s throat, as in photo 4, and finishes off assailant A with a high side kick,as in photos 5 and 6.[images/9780897502504_409.jpg][images/9780897502504_410.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST ASSAILANTS AFTER BEING PINNED TO THE WALLIn photo 1, Lee is pinned to the wall by two assailants. He quickly delivers aside kick to assailant A’s groin and blocks the straight left that is thrown byassailant B, as in photo 2. He follows up with a right cross and a front kick tothe groin of assailant B, as in photos 3 and 4.[images/9780897502504_411.jpg][images/9780897502504_412.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST ASSAILANTS FROM A LYING POSITIONWhile lying on the ground, Lee is attacked by assailants from both directions,as in photo 1. In photo 2, Lee uses his hands to stop the kick thrown byassailant A, and he simultaneously applies a thrust kick to assailant B’s knee,top­pling him to the ground, as in photo 3. Hanging on to as­sailant A’s foot,Lee then applies a forward kick to his groin, as in photos 4 and 5.[images/9780897502504_413.jpg][images/9780897502504_414.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST AN AMBUSHAs he strolls along, Lee is stopped by assailant A, as in photos 1 and 2. Leegrabs assailant A’s wrist, finger jabs his eyes, follows up with a hook to hischin, as in photos 3 and 4, and sends the as­sailant tumbling to the ground infront of him, as in photo 5. When assailant B comes to the aid of his fallencomrade, Lee greets him with a hook kick to his chest, as in photos 6 and 7.[images/9780897502504_415.jpg][images/9780897502504_416.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BEAR HUG AND A FRONTAL ATTACKAssailant A bear-hugs Lee by pinning his arms while assailant B prepares toswing at him, as in photo 1. In photo 2, Lee counters with a left front kick toassailant B’s groin. Lee then places his left foot back, holds as­sailant A’sarms and flips him to the ground with a twist of his body, as in photos 3 and 4.Lee finishes off assailant A with a straight punch to his face, as in photos 5and 6.[images/9780897502504_417.jpg][images/9780897502504_418.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A BEAR HUG AND TWO FRONTAL ATTACKSIn photo 1, Lee is pinned in a bear hug by assailant A while assailants B and Cpre­pare to move in. Lee quickly attacks the groin of assailant A, as in photo2. In photos 3 and 4, with one sweeping motion, Lee throat-chops assailant Awith his left hand and punches assail­ant B with his right. He finishes offassail­ant C with a side kick to his chest, as in photo 5.[images/9780897502504_419.jpg][images/9780897502504_420.jpg]DEFENSE AGAINST A FULL NELSON AND A FRONTAL ATTACKWhile held in a full nelson by assailant A, assailant B moves toward thedefender, as in photo 1. Leaping high in the air, the defender kicks assailantB’s chest, which causes him to reel back­ward, as in photo 2. As the defenderlands on his feet, as in photo 3, he bends forward and raises his right foot,slam­ming it hard into assailant A’s instep, as in photos 4 and 5. As assailantA loosens his grip, the defender counters with an el­bow to his face, as inphotos 6 and 7.[images/9780897502504_421.jpg][images/9780897502504_422.jpg]AIDING A VICTIM OR FRIENDIn photo 1, the defender’s friend is being shoved around by a bully. The bullyhas not seen the defender, so he quick­ly sneaks up on the bully, as in photo 2,grabs his shoulder, as in photo 3, and delivers a side kick behind his knee,bringing him to his knees, as in photos 4 and 5. Then the defender and hisfriend grab the bully’s wrists, as in photo 6, and pin him to the ground withhis face down, as in photos 7 and 8.[images/9780897502504_423.jpg]Note: When two or three in­dividuals attack you, they normally are overconfidentand attack recklessly. This is an added advantage for you because they are boundto leave an opening that they normally wouldn’t leave during a one­-on-oneencounter. Because you do not usually have a second chance in amultiple-assailant attack, you have to be sure that your techniques are executedwith effectiveness. You can’t worry about trying not to maim your assailants.You have to give the fight all you’ve got."},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502504_424.jpg]CHAPTER 24DEFENSE FROM A VULNERABLE POSITIONBruce Lee included this chapter because he believed that an attack can come fromanywhere, even while you’re sitting in a chair or lying down. Or you could besurprised and have to fight your way from a prone position like when you arepinned on your back.To Lee, any defense is all right, meaning that your delivery of kicks or punchesdoesn’t have to be beautiful or picturesque. In self-defense, everythinggoes–any way to get out of a predicament without damaging yourself–whether ascratch, bite, pinch, etc.[images/9780897502504_425.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A CHAIR: FRONTAL ATTACK, NO. 1Sitting in a chair, Lee is approached by an as­sailant, as in photo 1. Withoutwarning, the assailant rushes him, as in photo 2, and Lee instinctively deliversa front thrust kick to the groin without getting up, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_426.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A CHAIR: REAR ATTACKLee sits in a chair and is surprised by an assailant who sneaks up from behindhim and applies a head lock, as in photo A. In photos B and C, Lee grabs theassailant’s hair and applies a finger jab to his eyes.[images/9780897502504_427.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A CHAIR: FRONTAL ATTACK, NO. 2While sitting in a chair, Lee is surprised by an assailant, who grabs the frontof his shirt with both hands, as in photo 1. Lee quickly counters with a rightpunch to the assailant’s groin, as in photo 2.Note: To apply techniques in any of these attacks, you have to be quick andeffective. You are in a disadvantageous position, and a slow reac­tion on yourpart might mean further problems. For instance, if the attacker is able to knockyou down from the chair and pin you, you have to apply other techniques that arenot as sim­ple, and it might take longer for you to free yourself orincapacitate the assail­ant.[images/9780897502504_428.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A LYING POSITION: HEAD LOCKIn photo A, the defender is pinned by an assailant, who has him in a head lockand has his right hand pinned. Using his free left hand, the defender grabs theassailant’s ear and pulls on it until he releases his grip, as in photos B to D.[images/9780897502504_429.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A LYING POSITION: CROSS-BODYIn photo 1, the assailant pins the defender in a cross-body position, leavinghis arms free. The defender grabs the assailant’s ear with his right hand, as inphoto 2, and applies an elbow to his body, as in photo 3.[images/9780897502504_430.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A LYING POSITION: CHOKE HOLDIn photo A, the defender is lying flat on his back with the assail­antstraddling his chest and choking him. The defender grasps one of the assailant’swrists to relieve the choke’s pressure, and with the other hand, applies afinger jab to his eyes, as in photo B.Note: Defending yourself in a prone position is more difficult than in anupright position. First, you are not as mobile. Second, you are limited in youruse of defensive tech­niques like kicking or punch­ing. Third, because of yourlimited mobility, you can easily be overcome by two or more attackers.[images/9780897502504_431.jpg]DEFENSE FROM A PRONE POSITION: STOMPING BLOWIn photo 1, the defender is lying on his back and the assailant, who is holdingthe defender’s right wrist with both hands, attempts to stomp on his chest. Thedefender rolls quickly toward the assailant and trips him to the ground, as inphotos 2 and 3. Then, he applies a left corkscrew hook to his groin, as inphotos 4 and 5.[images/9780897502504_432.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"INDEXAAbdominal muscles, 17
