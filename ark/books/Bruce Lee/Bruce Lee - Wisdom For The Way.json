We sought to bring together a book of some of my father’s mostinspirational and thought-provoking quotes with some beautiful and evocativeimages so that as you read, you are also uplifted by a visual element. Theimagery consists of Bruce Lee photos, graphic elements, and symbolic picturesthat are meant to help express the essence of the words on the page.My father was constantly writing, whether it was penning letters to friends,pondering his own experiences, or researching and taking in the experience ofothers. He wrote constantly in journals, in the margins of books, and on paper.Writing really helped him process and understand his thoughts and his dailyexperience. He was also compelled to share these thoughts with friends,coworkers and anyone with a true interest and desire to have a provocativediscussion about life. So we are the benefi ciaries of all this, for we have awritten legacy that, in my father’s tradition, we are able to continue to share.There are many books composed of my father’s written words available for salethese days, but we felt it was important to make an accessible and manageablebut also beautifully appointed collection of quotes that anyone can pick up,easily flip through and come away affected by its wisdom and beauty. Unlike someof the others, this book is not focused on one specific topic, and it is not ofoverwhelming length. It is meant to be simple. I hope you enjoy this book andreturn to it often. I hope you reflecton the words and the images and are asinspired by them as I am every time! This truly is wisdom for the way.…Shannon Lee"},{"pageContent":"Empty your mind.Be formless,shapeless—like water.If you put water into a cup,it becomes the cup.You put water into a bottle,it becomes the bottle.You put it in a teapot,it becomes the teapot.Now, water can flowor it can crash.Be water, my friend.[images/9780897502528_001.jpg] Using no way as way; having no limitation as limitation.[images/9780897502528_002.jpg] The original founder of a stylestarted out with hypothesis.But now it has becomethe gospel truth,and people who go into thatbecome the product of it.It doesn’t matterhow you are,who you are,how you are structured,how you are builtor how you are made…it doesn’t seem to matter.You just go in there andbe that product.And that, to me, is not right.[images/9780897502528_003.jpg] Alltypesofknowledgeultimatelymeanself-knowledge.[images/9780897502528_004.jpg] Whenever I look around,I always learn one thing,and that is:lways be yourself…express yourself,have faith in yourself.Do not go out and look for asuccessful personalityand duplicate him.[images/9780897502528_006.jpg] To me, ultimately,martial art meanshonestly expressing yourself.Now it is very difficult to do.It is easy for me to put on a showand be cocky andthen feel pretty cool.Or I can do all kindsof phony things.Or I can show you somereally fancy movement.But to express oneself honestly,not lying to oneself—that, my friend,is very hard to do.[images/9780897502528_007.jpg] If I tell you I’m good,probably you will saythat I’m boasting.But if I tell youI’m not good,you’ll know I’m lying.[images/9780897502528_008.jpg] Be pliable.When a man is living,he is soft and pliable;when he is dead,he becomes rigid.Pliability is life;rigidity is death,whether one speaksof man’s body,mind or his spirit.[images/9780897502528_009.jpg] Remember,success is a journey,not a destination.Have faith in your ability.You will do just fine.[images/9780897502528_010.jpg] You know how I like to think of myself?As a human being.Because, under the sky,under the heavens,there is but one family.It just so happenspeople are different.[images/9780897502528_011.jpg] Willpower:Recognizing thatthe power of will isthe supreme court overall other departmentsof my mind, I willexercise daily whenI need the urge to actfor any purpose; andI will form habitsdesigned to bring thepower of my willinto action at leastonce daily.[images/9780897502528_012.jpg] You have to createyour own luck.You have to be awareof the opportunitiesaround you andtake advantage of them.[images/9780897502528_013.jpg] Defeat is a state of mind;no one is ever defeateduntil defeat has been acceptedas a reality.To me, defeat in anythingis merely temporary,and its punishment is but an urgefor me to exert greater effortto achieve my goal.Defeat simply tells methat something is wrong in my doing;it is a path leading tosuccess and truth.[images/9780897502528_014.jpg] Once I slow downbecause I thinkI have reachedmy peak,then my skillswill go nowherebut down.[images/9780897502528_015.jpg] Learningis definitely not mere imitation,nor is it the abilityto accumulate and regurgitatefixed knowledge.Learningis a constant process of discovery—a process without end.[images/9780897502528_016.jpg] Conscience:Recognizing that my emotionsoften err in their over-enthusiasm,and my faculty of reasonoften is without the warmth of feelingthat is necessary to enable meto combine justice with mercyin my judgments,I will encourage my conscienceto guide me as to what isright and wrong,but I will never set asidethe verdicts it renders,no matter what may bethe cost of carrying them out.[images/9780897502528_017.jpg] I don’t know what isthe meaning of death,but I am not afraid to die—and I go on, nonstop,going forward.Even though I,Bruce Lee,may die some daywithout fulfillingall of my ambitions,I will have no regrets.I did what I wanted to do,and what I’ve done,I’ve done with sincerityand to the best of my ability.You can’t expect much more from life.[images/9780897502528_018.jpg] Art is reallythe expressionof the self.[images/9780897502528_019.jpg] In building a statue,a sculptor doesn’t keepadding clay to his subject.Actually, he keepschiseling away atthe nonessentialsuntil the truth of his creationis revealed without obstruction.[images/9780897502528_020.jpg] You must accept the factthat there is no helpbut self-help.I cannot tell youhow to gain freedomsincefreedom existswithin you.[images/9780897502528_021.jpg] Subconscious Mind:Reorganizing the influenceof my subconscious mindover my power of will,I shall take care to submit to ita clear and definite pictureof my major purpose in lifeand all minor purposesleading to my major purpose,and I shall keep this pictureconstantly before mysubconscious mindby repeating it daily![images/9780897502528_022.jpg] A martial artist is a human being first.Just as nationalities havenothing to dowith one’s humanity,so they have nothing to dowith martial arts.[images/9780897502528_023.jpg] If nothing within youstays rigid,outward thingswill disclose themselves.Moving, be like water;still, be like a mirror;respond likean echo.[images/9780897502528_025.jpg] The great mistakeis to anticipatethe outcomeof the engagement;you ought notto be thinking ofwhether it endsin victory orin defeat.Let nature takeits course, andyour toolswill strike atthe right moment.[images/9780897502528_026.jpg] Memory:Recognizing the valueof an alert mind andan alert memory,I will encourage mineto become alert bytaking care to impress it clearlywith all thoughts I wish to recalland by associatingthose thoughtswith related subjectswhich I may call to mindfrequently.[images/9780897502528_027.jpg] We shall findthe truthwhen we examinethe problem.The problem isnever apart fromthe answer.The problem isthe answer—understandingthe problemdissolvesthe problem.[images/9780897502528_028.jpg] Not being tensebut ready;not thinking yetnot dreaming;not being setbut flexible—it is being whollyand quietly alive,aware and alert,ready forwhatever may come.[images/9780897502528_029.jpg] It is compassionrather than principle of justicethat can guard us against beingunjust to our fellow men.[images/9780897502528_030.jpg] We are told thattalent createsits own opportunities.Yet it sometimes seemsthat intense desirecreates not onlyits own opportunitiesbut its own talentsas well.[images/9780897502528_005.jpg] Self-actualization is the important thing.And my personal message to peopleis that I hope they will go towardself-actualization rather thanself-image actualization.I hope that they will searchwithin themselves forhonest self-expression.[images/9780897502528_031.jpg] It is like a fingerpointing a wayto the moon.Don’t concentrateon the fingeror you will missall thatheavenlyglory.[images/9780897502528_031a.jpg] Independent inquiryis needed in yoursearch for truth,not dependenceon anyone else’s viewor a mere book.[images/9780897502528_032.jpg] The meaningof lifeis that it isto be lived.[images/9780897502528_033.jpg] Life itself is your teacher,and you arein a state ofconstant learning.[images/9780897502528_034.jpg] Remember, my friend,to enjoy your planningas well as your accomplishment,for life istoo short fornegative energy.[images/9780897502528_035.jpg] Imagination:Recognizing the needfor sound plans and ideasfor the attainment of mydesires, I will develop myimagination by callingupon it daily for help inthe formation of my plans.[images/9780897502528_036.jpg] My friend,think of the past in termsof those memories of eventsand accomplishmentswhich were pleasant,rewarding and satisfying.The present?Well, think of it in termsof challenges and opportunities,and the rewards availablefor the application ofyour talents and energies.As for the future,that is a time and placewhere every worthyambition you possessis within your grasp.[images/9780897502528_037.jpg] What we are after is the rootand not the branches.The root is the real knowledge;the branches are surface knowledge.Real knowledge breeds “body feel”and personal expression;surface knowledge breedsmechanical conditioningand imposing limitation andsquelches creativity.[images/9780897502528_038.jpg] The past is no more;the future is not yet.Nothing exists exceptthe here and now.Our grand business isnot to see what liesdimly at a distance,but to do what liesclearly at hand.[images/9780897502528_039.jpg] If you spendtoo much timethinking abouta thing,you’ll neverget it done.[images/9780897502528_040.jpg] Truth comes whenyour mind and heartare purged ofall sense of strivingand you are no longer tryingto become somebody;it is therewhen the mind is very quiet,listening timelesslyto everything.[images/9780897502528_041.jpg] Success means doing somethingsincerelyandwholeheartedly.[images/9780897502528_042.jpg] Reason:Recognizing that mypositive and negativeemotions may be dangerousif they are not controlledand guided to desirable ends,I will submit all my desires,aims, and purposes tomy faculty of reason,and I will be guided by itin giving expressionto these.[images/9780897502528_043.jpg] Don’tthink—feel![images/9780897502528_044.jpg] Knowledgewill give you power,but character,respect.[images/9780897502528_045.jpg] Every emotionexpresses itselfin themuscular system.Anxiety istremendousexcitement held,bottled up.[images/9780897502528_046.jpg] If every manwould helphis neighbor,no manwould bewithout help.[images/9780897502528_047.jpg] Be apracticaldreamerbacked byaction.[images/9780897502528_048.jpg] It is not a shameto be knocked downby other people.The important thingis to ask when you’rebeing knocked down,“Why am I beingknocked down?”If a person canreflect in this way,then there is hopefor the person.[images/9780897502528_049.jpg] Tochangewithchangeis thechangelessstate.[images/9780897502528_050.jpg] What I honestly valuemore than anything else isquality:doing one’s bestin the manner ofthe responsibility andcraftsmanship of aNumber One.[images/9780897502528_051.jpg] What you habitually thinklargely determineswhat you willultimately become.[images/9780897502528_052.jpg] Emotions:Realizing that my emotionsare both positive and negative,I will form daily habitswhich will encouragethe development ofthe positive emotionsand aid me in convertingthe negative emotionsinto some form ofuseful action.[images/9780897502528_053.jpg] A goal is not alwaysmeant to be reached.It often serves simply assomething to aim at.[images/9780897502528_054.jpg] Keep your mind onthe things you wantand off those you don’t.[images/9780897502528_055.jpg] You will never getany more out of lifethan you expect.Every man todayis the resultof his thoughtsof yesterday.[images/9780897502528_056.jpg] Probably people will sayI’m too conscious of success.Well, I am not.Success comes to those whobecome success-conscious.If you don’t aim at an object,how the heck on earthdo you think you can get it?[images/9780897502528_057.jpg] When I look around,I always learn somethingand that isto bealways yourself.And to expressyourself.To have faith inyourself.Do not go outand look for asuccessful personalityand duplicate it …start from the very root of (your)being, which is“how can I be me?”[images/9780897502528_058.jpg] Research your own experience;absorb what is useful,reject what is useless andadd what is essentiallyyour own.[images/9780897502528_059.jpg] When I have listenedto my mistakes,Ihavegrown.[images/9780897502528_060.jpg] The mindis like a fertile garden—it will grow anythingyou wish to plant—beautiful flowers or weeds.And so it is withsuccessful, healthy thoughtsor negative ones that will,like weeds, strangle andcrowd the others.Do not allownegative thoughtsto enter your mindfor they are the weedsthat strangle confidence.[images/9780897502528_061.jpg] We do not live for;we simplylive.[images/9780897502528_061a.jpg] We are always in the processof becoming and nothing is fixed.Have no rigid system in youand you’ll be flexible tochange with the ever-changing.Open yourself and flow at oncewith the total flowing now.[images/9780897502528_062a.jpg] Angerblinds![images/9780897502528_062.jpg] Life is wide,limitless—there is no border,no frontier.[images/9780897502528_062b.jpg] So, action! Action!Never wasting energyon worries andnegative thoughts.I mean who has themost insecure jobas I have?What do I live on?My faith in my abilitythat I’ll make it.Sure, my back screwedme up good for a year,but with every adversitycomes a blessingbecause a shock acts asa reminder to oneselfthat we must not getstale in routine.Look at a rainstorm;after its departureeverything grows![images/9780897502528_063.jpg] Be proficient in your fieldas well as inharmony among fellow men.[images/9780897502528_064.jpg] What istrue stillness?Stillness inmovement.[images/9780897502528_065.jpg] One will never get any morethan he thinks he can get.You havewhat it takes.Look back and seeyour progress—damn the torpedo,full speed ahead![images/9780897502528_066.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/9780897502528_067.jpg]www.bruceleefoundation.orgwww.blackbeltmag.com"}]
