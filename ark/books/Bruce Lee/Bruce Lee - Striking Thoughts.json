Fans of his movies were dazzled by his physicalbrilliance, martial arts practitioners were awed by his deep understanding ofthe combative arts, while others found guidance in his underlying philosophy,which wove the spiritual and physical aspects of martial art together into a wayof life. His study of philosophy in college was the spring board of what would become alife-long exploration of the major thinkers of the world. He did not confine himself to any particular culture or philosophical era. Instead, he collected andavidly studied hundreds of books on all types of philosophy-Western, Eastern,ancient, and modern-in an attempt to glean those tenets that would contribute tohis own spiritual growth.Through the constant process of learning, Bruce evolved a personal philosophy,the central theme of which was the liberation of the spirit through greaterself-knowledge. To free one's self from preconceived notions, prejudices, andconditioned responses is essential to understanding truth and reality. Martialart was the medium that gave Bruce the means to expand his potential and toshare with others. As a teacher of the arts, Bruce had extraordinary talent. Heoften said, \"A teacher is never a giver of truth; he is a guide, a pointer tothe truth that each student must find for himself. A good teacher is merely acatalyst.\" One of his favorite stories that he would tell new students was thestory of the \"empty tea cup\":> A learned man once went to visit a Zen teacher to inquire about Zen. As the> Zen teacher talked, the learned man frequently interrupted to express his own> opinion about this or that. Finally, the Zen teacher stopped talking and began> to serve tea to the learned man. He poured the cup full, then kept pouring> until the cup overflowed. \"Stop,\" said the learned man. \"The cup is full, no> more can be poured in.\" \"Like this cup, you are full of your own opinions,\"> replied the Zen teacher. \"If you do not first empty your cup, how can you> taste my cup of tea?\" Since he himself would not wholly accept any particular style of martial art orphilosophy, Bruce encouraged his students not to accept, without question, histeachings. His main message was to keep one’s mind, attitude, and senses pliableand receptive, and, at the same time, develop the ability to think critically.This process of inquiry, debate, and practice would lead not only to knowledgeof one's physical strengths and weaknesses but also to the discovery of basictruths that allow one to grow toward a state of harmonious unity of spirit,mind, and body.Bruce's teaching affected people in various ways. He often disturbed martial artpractitioners by upsetting their set patterns of training and causing them toreconsider the blind acceptance of philosophical tenets. Those who studied withBruce personally, or knew him through his writings, have been inspired todevelop their potential beyond previously imposed limits, and to coordinatetheir minds and bodies to the point where confidence overrides fear.By his example, Bruce encouraged his followers to be creative in directing theirlives. \"Circumstances?\" he would say with a smile, \"Hell, I make circumstances!\"In his drive to realise his goals, Bruce refused to be hampered by adversity.His answer to problems was to turn a stumbling block into a stepping stone. Forinstance, when he was confined to bed rest for six months because of a backinjury, he used that opportunity to compile his training methods and hisphilosophical thoughts into several volumes.

Far more than just a passing influence, Leehas continued to inspire and stimulate the minds of individuals from all walksof life for decades. Interest in his thought is on the rise and many regard himas a contemporary philosopher and visionary, discovering in his words anantidote to contemporary problems, as well as finding him a model of discipline,strength, and wisdom. Lee's philosophy forms for us a vision of a world ofprogress, a world free of suffering, and a world of enlightenment unflawed byignorance, superstition, and corruption. In Lee's words, a world of \"love, peaceand brotherhood.\"To Bruce Lee, philosophy was not the professional playground of academics, butevery human being's gateway to the greatest adventure of the human spirit. Itilluminated the frontiers of human possibility and obliterated the shadows ofdoubt and insecurity. Unlike others, content to follow, Bruce Lee insisted uponcharting his own course toward truth, and he encouraged those who wished toshare his insights to do likewise. While Lee was a champion of individual rightsand individual development, both of which stress the sovereignty of theindividual as an end in himself, he also spoke to something deeper-thecommonality of all human beings and the removal of such artificial barriers totrue brotherhood as nationality, ethnicity, and class structure, so that humanbeings could live together peaceably as independent equals.Bruce Lee rejected blind obedience to external authority. He urged human beingsto hold themselves and their lives as their highest values and wrote in praiseof \"the artist of life\" who lives by his own judgment and who is willing tostand alone against tradition and popular opinion. Lee pointed out that \"We havemore faith in what we imitate than in what we originate,” with the result thatwe are encouraged-and have opted-to look to anyone but ourselves for the answersto our most unsettling questions. Too many are confused about whom to trust,suspicious of their own impulses and uncertain of their futures. Spirits havebeen malnourished and minds stunted by allowing others to \"take over\" or decidewhat constitute \"real\" problems.Striking Thoughts: Bruce Lee's Wisdom for Daily Living, then, is a book for thefree spirit who chooses to live by the power of his or her own mind rather thanrelying on the dictates of creed or institution in making decisions about lifeand how to live it. Consisting of eight sections, 72 topics, and 825 aphorisms,Striking Thoughts is for all who have sought truth but not found it in platitudeor dogma. Within the pages of Striking Thoughts you will find that Bruce Lee hasnot so much prepared a banquet of easy answers as outlined a means by which youcan prepare your own way. And if you are suffering, dispirited, or anxious, inhis words you will find observations and insights that can fortify you andpacify your troubled spirit.How can I say such things? Simply because Bruce Lee's words have done as muchfor me-and for thousands more from all walks of life and from all over the worldwho have taken the time to write or e-mail The Bruce Lee Educational Foundationoffering identical testimony. It is easy to see the appeal of Lee's thought, forhe dares to say that which others dare only to think; his candor disarms ourinsecurities and fears. Lee is capable of infusing a single sentence with aprofundity that would take others at least a chapter to convey; his everyaphorism is a mountain peak, offering a higher vantage point for viewing theunfolding of life's means and mysteries. The supreme irony is that this profoundthought was the fruit of a life that spanned a mere 32 years.The title \"Striking Thoughts\" is taken from a heading that Bruce Lee created fora series of maxims he wrote down after reading the philosopher JidduKrishnamurti's book First and Last Freedom. However, the committing to paper(and, later, to audiotape) of ''striking thoughts\" was a habit of Lee's thatextended back to his early days in Hong Kong. Included within the pages of thisbook are those \"striking thoughts\" that issued forth in conversations,interviews, and correspondence that Bruce Lee shared with journalists, friends,and colleagues. Other entries are postulates that Lee had been moved to typeout--perhaps with an eye toward one day making use of them--others were quicklyjotted down before they escaped his concentration. Still others were noted inbook margins as he read; the result of a \"striking thought\" that had come to himas he was closely regarding a particular writer or philosopher's point of view.Lee's personal library contained the works of many great and diversephilosophers and sages from many different cultures and provided him with abroad comprehension of how all people-as opposed to only people from his ownpersonal experience-actually viewed life, with its joy and suffering. Theirvarying viewpoints served as just instrument, too, for such a man as Bruce Lee,who wished to exercise the varied possibilities of speculation, who cared toclarify his own mind rather than to put forth finalities when life itself was soblind and inconclusive. After all, a dogmatic conclusion, Lee believed, was alltoo often merely the point at which the sails of thought had lost their wind.Bruce Lee's most common educational and literary form was the aphorism, and thispresentation follows that style. This book could be read like Bartlett'sFamiliar Quotations, but what one ultimately gets out of Bruce Lee will bedirectly proportionate to the sustained attention one accords him. It was alwaysthe individual whom Lee chose to address and it must be remembered that he wroteprimarily to express his own personal feelings on life, rather than to be readas a dogmatic arsenal of arguments for or against something. Lee grasped thepoint that in the realm of philosophy \"less is more,\" and it's precisely forthis reason that Lee's writings-particularly his aphorisms-gracefully transcendthe plodding complexity of traditional philosophy and serve a breath of freshair to those accustomed to taking their philosophical medicine with heavy dosesof metaphysics and epistemology. The intent of the aphorism is to arouse aheart-felt \"call to arms\" and not intellectual abstraction--however valid suchabstraction may prove to be. As Lee himself says in one of his aphorisms:> The end of man is action and not thought, though it be of the noblest. Bruce Lee's use of aphorism generally consists of starting with a familiar andimportant aspect of life, then positioning it to awaken people to the problemsinherent in the conventional assumptions made on the topic. The result of Lee'sstatement is that the reader is now compelled to think for himself about theissue, which leads the individual to produce his own answer. Lee alwayschallenged his students (both in the classroom and through his writings) not toagree or disagree-but to grow.Lee's constant questioning-of himself as well as of assumed truth-more oftenthan not reveals to us the inadequacy of the conventional position on suchmatters. It's this questioning that provides the necessary basis for realunderstanding to occur. As Lee himself said, it is only \"in the contrast ofcomparison some new thing might grow.\" Lee was firmly insistent that even if hewere to know the answers, and even if he were to tell them to us, they wouldn'tdo us any good. In other words, it's in the nature of Lee's statements on lifethat you have to puzzle out their validity for yourself. To Lee's way ofthinking, any answer he could provide is worth nothing to any other individual,unless that individual has come to see its validity as result of his ownindependent thought on the matter. This is why Lee's philosophical writings areso successful as instruments for drawing you into your own mind and, byextension, into the realm of philosophy.The processes of search and inquiry are important, but they must be followedwith an alert understanding that-because our assumptions and beliefs are in factopen to perpetual questioning-our \"conclusions\" don't hold any special orprivileged status. They are merely staging posts on the road to furtherinquiries we must continue to make throughout our lives. recognising that hisown positions on such issues could easily be made dogma by his students, Leeinstead chose to deploy the Socratic method of challenging his students (and nowthe reader) to confront or address, from within, the problems of existence thatwere besetting them. Lee held that if there is a \"way\" then it most assuredly issomebody else's-not yours-with the result that following it would lead youfurther away from the truth that resides within you. It is for this reason, asLee indicates below, that it is imperative that the free spirit not mistake anybook-including this one-or its contents for the truth, for then it will simplybecome yet another external authority:> Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on> anyone else’s view or a mere book.> > Or, as Lee cautioned in his last film, Enter the Dragon: > > It is like a finger pointing a way to the moon. Don’t concentrate on the> finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory. The objective of this volume, then, is two-fold; to have Bruce Lee communicatewith you and to have you communicate with yourself. This counsel given by Leewith regard to his teachings is particularly pertinent:> To live is a constant process of relating, so come on out of that shell of> isolation and conclusion) and relate DIRECTLY to what is being said. Bear in> mind I seek neither your approval nor to influence you. So do not make up your> mind as to “this is this'' or “that is that.” I will be more than satisfied if> you begin to learn to investigate everything yourself from now on. What Bruce Lee communicates to you in these pages is for you alone to interpret,and it falls solely to you to make of it what you will.- John Little[../Images/index-25_1.png] Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyoneelse's view or a mere book. -Bruce Lee"},{"pageContent":"PART1 [../Images/PART1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Life Emptiness the starting point. – In order to taste my cup of water you must firstempty your cup. My friend, drop all of your preconceived fixed ideas and beneutral. Do you know why this cup is so useful? Because it is empty. Flow in the process of life. - You can never step in the same water twice, myfriend. Like flowing water, life is perpetual movement. There is nothing fixed.Whatever your problems happen to be in the future, remember well that theycannot remain stationary but must move together with your living spirit.Otherwise, you will drift into artificiality or attempt to solidify theever-flowing. To avoid that, you must change and be flexible. Remember, theusefulness of a cup is in its emptiness. Life has no frontier. - Life is wide, limitless. There is no border, nofrontier. To live is a constant process of relating. - To live is a constant process ofrelating, so come on out of that shell of isolation and conclusion, and relateDIRECTLY to what is being said. Bear in mind I seek neither your approval nor toinfluence you. So do not make up your mind as to \"this is this\" or \"that isthat.\" I will be more than satisfied if you begin to learn to investigateeverything yourself from now on.Life simply is. - Living exists when life lives through us - unhampered in itsflow, for he who is living is not conscious of living and, in this, is the lifeit lives. Life lives; and in the living flow, no questions are raised. Thereason is that life is a living now! So, in order to live life whole-heartedly,the answer is life simply is. Life-for its own sake. - Realise the fact that you simply \"live\" and not \"livefor.\" The meaning of life. - The meaning of life is that it is to be lived, and it isnot to be traded and conceptualised and squeezed into a pattern of systems. Life is the effect of feelings.- Life is simply what our feelings do to us. The meaning in life. - All in all, the goal of my planning and doing is to findthe true meaning in life - peace of mind. In order to achieve this peace ofmind, the teaching of detachment of Taoism and Zen proved to be valuable.The secret of life.- The aphorism \"as a man thinketh in his heart so is he\"*contains the secret of life. James Allen further added \"A man is literally whathe thinks.\" This might be a shocking statement, but everything is a state ofmind. *Note: This is also found in Proverbs 23:7 which says \"As he thinketh in hisheart, so is he.\" Meaning is found in relationship. - Meaning is the relationship of theforeground figure to the background. Manipulation and control are not the ultimate joy of life. - We realise thatmanipulation and control are not the ultimate joy of life - to become real, tolearn to take a stand, to develop one's center, to the support of our totalpersonality, a release to spontaneity-yes, yes, yes! The essence of life. - The essence: free movement of spirit. Original essence. Violence is a part of life. - It should be remembered that violence andaggression is part of everyday life now. You see it over the TV. You can't justpretend that it does not exist. The principle of life. - Life is never stagnation. It is a constant movement,unrhythmic movement, as well as constant change. Things live by moving and gainstrength as they go. Life is sometimes unpleasant. - Life is an ever-flowing process and somewhere onthe path some unpleasant things will pop up-it might leave a scar, but then lifeis flowing, and like running water, when it stops it grows stale. Go bravely on,my friend, because each experience teaches us a lesson. Keep blasting becauselife is such that sometimes it is nice and sometimes it is not. The pendulum of life must have balance.- Only sober moderation lasts, and thatpersists through all time. Only the midpart of anything is preserved because thependulum of life must have balance, and the midpart is the balance. Pliability is life. - Be pliable. When a man is living, he is soft and pliable;when he is dead, he becomes rigid. Pliability is life; rigidity is death,whether one speaks of man's body, his mind, or his spirit. Life as educator. - Life itself is your teacher, and you are in a state ofconstant learning.To live is to create.- To live is to express, and to express you have to create.Creation is never merely repetition. To live is to express oneself freely increation. The process of life. - Since life is an ever-evolving process, one should flowin this process and discover how to actualise and expand oneself. The oneness of life. - The oneness of all life is a truth that can be fullyrealised only when false notions of a separate self-whose destiny can beconsidered apart from the WHOLE-are forever annihilated. The life of perfection is the simple life. - A simple life is one of plainness,in which profit is discarded, cleverness abandoned, selfishness eliminated, anddesires reduced. It is the life of perfection which seems to be incomplete, andof fullness which seems to be empty. It is the life which is as bright as light,but does not dazzle. In short, it is a life of harmony, unity, contentment,tranquility, constancy, enlightenment, peace, and long life. Life must be understood from moment to moment. - Life is something for whichthere is no answer; it must be understood from moment to moment - the answer wefind inevitably conforms to the pattern of what we think we know.Enjoy yourself - Remember my friend to enjoy your planning as well as youraccomplishment, for life is too short for negative energy."},{"pageContent":"Existence Existence and anti-existence. - What is the opposite of existence? Theimmediate answer would be \"nonexistence,\" but this is incorrect. The oppositewould be anti-existence, just as the opposite of matter is antimatter. Existence precedes consciousness. - The primary reality is not what I think, butthat I live, for those also live who do not think. Although this living may notbe a real living. God! What contradictions when we seek to join in wedlock lifeand reason! Existence is dynamic. -This state is far from static, it is a being withoutcontinuity. “Sum, ergo cogito.” - The truth is \"Sum, ergo cogito;\" \"I am, therefore Ithink,\" although not everything that is thinks. Is not conscious thinking aboveall consciousness of being? Is pure thought possible, without consciousness ofself, without personality? Can there exist pure knowledge without feeling,without that species of materiality which feeling lends to it? Do we not perhapsfeel thought, and do we not feel ourselves in the act of knowing and willing? The fundamental relationship between existence and cognition. - To doubt is tothink, and thought is the only thing in the universe whose existence cannot bedenied, because to deny is to think. When one says that thought exists, itautomatically includes saying that one exists because there is no thought thatdoes not contain as one of its elements a subject who thinks."},{"pageContent":"Time On past, present, and future. - My friend, do think of the past in terms ofthose memories of events and accomplishments which were pleasant, rewarding, andsatisfying. The present? Well, think of it in terms of challenges andopportunities, and the rewards available for the application of your talents andenergies. As for the future, that is a time and a place where every worthyambition you possess is within your grasp. The timeless moment. - The “moment\" has no yesterday or tomorrow. It is not theresult of thought and therefore has no time. Knowledge, knowing, and time. - Knowledge, surely, is always of time, whereasknowing is not of time. Knowledge is from a source, from an accumulation, from aconclusion, while knowing is a movement. To be free of the bonds of time. - To realise freedom the mind has to learn tolook at life, which is vast movement, without the bondage of time, for freedomlies beyond the field of consciousness-care for watching, but don't stop andinterpret “I am free,\" then you're living in a memory of something that hasgone.Time spent vs. time wasted. - To spend time is to pass it in a specified manner.To waste time is to expend it thoughtlessly or carelessly. We all have time toeither spend or waste, and it is our decision what to do with it. But oncepassed, it is gone forever. The value of time. - Time means a lot to me because, you see, I, too, am also alearner and am often lost in the joy of forever developing and simplifying. Ifyou love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of. Time and philosophy. - My only problem these days is time.

Itis a very schizophrenic way to make a living, but then, that's what Universityof Washington philosophy courses prepare you for, I suppose."},{"pageContent":"The Root The root in life. - Be aware of doing your best to under-rand the ROOT in lifeand realise the DIRECT and the INDIRECT are in fact a complementary WHOLE. It isto see things as they are and not to become attached to anything - to beunconscious means to be innocent of the working of a relative (empirical) mind -when there is no abiding of thought anywhere on anything - this is beingunbound. This not abiding anywhere is the root of our life. The root of concentration. - Concentration is the ROOT of all the higherabilities in man. Seek to understand the root.- It is futile to argue as to which single leaf,which design of branch, or which attractive flower you like; when you understandthe root, you understand all its blossoming. The root vs. the branches. - What we are after is the ROOT and not the branches.The root is the real knowledge; the branches are surface knowledge. Realknowledge breeds \"body feel\" and personal expression; surface knowledge breedsmechanical conditioning and imposing limitation and squelches creativity.Express your total presence from the root. - Be at once absorbingly open androotily relaying your captivating total presence with appropriate inward time. The root is the starting point. - The root is the fulcrum on which will rest theexpression of your soul; the root is the \"starting point\" of all naturalmanifestation.

The Now covers all that exists. - The part is no more, the future is not yet.NOW includes the balance of being here, experiencing, involvement, phenomenon,awareness.Flow in the living moment. - We are always in a process of becoming and NOTHINGis fixed. Have no rigid system in you, and you'll be flexible to change with theever changing. OPEN yourself and flow, my friend. Flow in the TOTAL OPENESS OFTHE LIVING MOMENT. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things willdisclose themselves. Moving, be like water. Still, be like a mirror. Respondlike an echo. The Now is total awareness. - The \"space\" created between \"what is\" and \"whatshould be.\" Total awareness of the now and not the disciplined stillness.You cannot force the Now. - But can you neither condemn nor justify and yet beextraordinarily alive as you walk on? You can never invite the wind, but youmust leave the window open. Being in the Now. - Listen. Can you hear the wind? And can you hear the birdssinging? You have to HEAR IT. Empty your mind. You know how water fills a cup?It BECOMES that cup. You have to think about nothing. You have to BECOMEnothing. The Moment is freedom. - I couldn't live by a rigid schedule. I try to livefreely from moment to moment, letting things happen and adjusting to them.The Now is creative. - If you are in the NOW, you are creative. The Now is inventive. - If you are in the NOW, you are inventive. There is no anxiety in the Now. - When you are in the NOW, you can't be anxious,because the excitement flows immediately into ongoing spontaneous activity. The Now and its synonyms. - One and the same thing:> · Living in the NOW > > · Maturity > > · Authenticity > > · Responsibility for one's action/life> > · Response - Ability> > · Having the Creativeness of the NOW availableTo live now you must die to yesterday. - To understand and live now, there mustbe dying to everything of yesterday. Die continually to every newly gainedexperience-be in a state of choiceless awareness of WHAT IS.The Now is indivisible. - Completeness, the now, is an absence of the consciousmind to strive to divide that which is indivisible.

All the pieces of a car thathas been taken apart may be there, but it is no longer a car in its originalnature, which is its function or life."},{"pageContent":"Reality Matter and energy are one. - In atomic physics no distinction is recognisedbetween matter and energy; nor is it possible to make such a distinction, sincethey are in reality one essence, or at least two poles of the same unit. It isno longer possible, as it was in the mechanistic scientific era, to absolutelydefine weight, length, or time, etc., as the work of Einstein, Plank, Whitehead,and Jeans has demonstrated. Reality: the Western approach. - The Western approach to reality is mostlythrough theory, and theory begins by denying reality-to talk about reality, togo around reality, to catch anything that attracts our sense - intellect andabstract it away from reality itself.Nothingness is a form of process.- In science we have finally come back to thepre-Socratic philosopher, Heraclitus, who said that everything is flow, flux,process. There are no \"things.\" NOTHINGNESS in Eastern language is\"nothingness.\" We in the West think of nothingness as a void, an emptiness, anonexistence. In Eastern philosophy and modern physical science, nothingness -nothingness - is a form of process, ever moving. “Is” vs. “should.” What is andwhat should be. - What IS is more important than WHAT SHOULD BE. Too many peopleare looking at \"what is\" from a position of thinking \"what should be.\" Western philosophy’s denial of reality. - The Western approach to reality ismostly through theory, and theory begins by denying reality - to talk aboutreality, to go around reality, to catch anything that attracts our sense -intellect and abstract it away from reality itself. Thus philosophy begins bysaying that the outside world is not a basic fact, that its existence can bedoubted and that every proposition in which the reality of the outside world isaffirmed is not an evident proposition but one that needs to be divided,dissected, and analysed. It is to stand consciously aside and try to square acircle.There is no method to reality. - Do not reduce reality to a static thing andthen invent methods by which to reach it. Reality and perception. - There is a difference:> ·The world > > · Our reaction to it Experiencing is believing. - A fat belly cannot believe that such a thing ashunger exists. Be arduous in locating “this.” - While walking or resting, sitting or lying,while talking or remaining... quiet, while eating or drinking, do not allowyourself to be indolent, but be most arduous in search of \"THIS.\" The formal reality of a thing. - Whatever exists has certain reality.Nonrepresentation of an object is not a formal reality. On causality. - Everything has to have a cause. Reality and the law of cause and effect. - The cause must have the same realityas the effect.Commonality of all physical objects. - All physical objects are the same.Therefore, the knowledge of knowing the existence of a physical object isenough. Formal reality equals objective reality. - There must be more or as much formalreality as objective reality. Matter and the need for security. - In science we try to find ultimate matter,but the more we split up matter, the more we find other matter. We findmovement, and movement equals energy: movement, impact, energy, but nothings. Things came about, more or less, by man's need for security. You canmanipulate a thing, you can play fitting games with it. These concepts, thesesomethings can be put together into something else. “Something\" is a thing, soeven an abstract noun becomes a thing. Calm your mind to really see. - At this moment stop inwardly - when you do stopinwardly, psychologically, your mind becomes very peaceful, very clear. Then youcan really look at \"this.\" Remove the dirt of preconceived opinion. - Scratch away all the dirt our beinghas accumulated and reveal reality in its is-ness, or in its suchness, or in itsnakedness, which corresponds to the Buddhist concept of emptiness.Conditioning obstructs our view of reality. - We do not see IT in its suchnessbecause of our indoctrination, crooked and twisted. True thusness and thought. - True thusness is without defiling thought; itcannot be known through conception and thought. Reality is apparent when one ceases to compare. - There is “what is\" only whenthere is no comparison at all, and to live with what is, is to be peaceful. Reality is being itself - It is being itself, in becoming itself. Reality in itsisness, the “isness\" of a thing. Thus isness is the meaning-having freedom inits primary sense-not limited by attachments, confinements, partialisation,complexities."},{"pageContent":"The Laws The law of self-will. - A self-willed man obeys a different law, the one law I,too, hold absolutely sacred - the human law in himself, his own individual will.The law of cause and effect. - Every circumstance of every man's life is theresult of a definite cause - mode and control are yours. The law of identity. - The law of identity states that \"A is A.\" This means thatevery logical statement is either true or false but that no statement is bothtrue and false in the same context. The law of harmony. - The law of harmony, in which one should be in harmonywith, and not in opposition to, the strength and force of the opposition. Thismeans that one should do nothing that is not natural or spontaneous; theimportant thing is not to strain in any way. The law of non-interference with nature. - The law of non-interference withnature is a basic principle of Taoism [stating] that one should be in harmonywith, not rebellion against, the fundamental laws of the universe. Preserveyourself by following the natural bends of things and don't interfere. Remembernever to assert your self against nature; never be in frontal opposition to anyproblems, but to control it by swinging with it."},{"pageContent":"Interdependency Dualism vs. monism. - The dualistic philosophy reigned supreme in Europe,dominating the development of Western science. But with the advent of atomicphysics, findings based on demonstrable experiment were seen to negate thedualistic theory, and the trend of thought since then has been back toward themonistic conception of the ancient Taoists. The interdependency of thought and existence.- If thought exists, I who thinkand the world about which I think also exist; the one exists but for the other,having no possible separation between them. Therefore, the world and I are bothin active correlation; I am that which sees the world, and the world is thatwhich is seen by me. I exist for the world, and the world exists for me. Ifthere were not things to be seen, thought about, and imagined, I would not see,think, or imagine. That is to say, I would not exist. One sure and primary andfundamental fact is the joint existence of a subject and of its world. The onedoes not exist without the other. I acquire no understanding of myself except asI take account of objects, of the surroundings. I do not think unless I think ofthings - and there I find myself.The relationship of subject and object. - It is of no use to talk merely aboutobjects of consciousness, whether they are thought sensations or wax candles. Anobject must have a subject, and subject-object is a pair of complementaries (notopposites), like all others, which are two halves of one whole, and are afunction each of the other. When we hold to the core, the opposite sides are thesame if they are seen from the center of the moving circle. I do not experience;I am experience. I am not the subject of an experience; I am that experience. Iam awareness. Nothing else can be I or can exist. The subject/object relationship and “the-moon-in-the-water.” - The phenomenon ofmoon-in-the-water is likened to human experience. The water is the subject, andthe moon the object. When there is no water, there is no moon-in-the-water, andlikewise when there is no moon. But when the moon rises, the water does not waitto receive its image, and when even the tiniest drop of water is poured out, themoon does not wait to cast its reflection. For the moon does not intend to castits reflection, and the water does not receive its image on purpose. The eventis caused as much by the water as by the moon, and as the water manifests thebrightness of the moon, the moon manifests the clarity of the water.Interdependency and Taoism. - Taoist philosophy, against the background of whichacupuncture had its origin and developed, is essentially monistic. The Chineseconceived the entire universe as activated by two principles, the Yang and theYin, the positive and negative, and they considered that nothing that exists,either animate or so-called inanimate, does so except by virtue of the ceaselessinterplay of these two forces. Matter and energy, Yang and Yin, heaven andearth, are conceived of as essentially one or as two coexistent poles of oneindivisible whole."},{"pageContent":" The Void On voidness. - Voidness is that which stands right in the middle between thisand that. The void is all-inclusive; having no opposite, there is nothing whichit excludes or opposes. The all-illuminating light shines and is beyond themovement of the opposites.

The void as creative energy. - The primordial creative energy affects the wholeperson and not a mere fragment - it is creation uncontaminated by thought; thecreative tide in us that flows outward.The void and nothingness. - NOTHINGNESS means \"no thingness\" - there is onlyprocess, happening. When we ACCEPT and ENTER this nothingness, the void, thenthe desert starts to bloom. The empty void becomes alive, IS BEING FILLED. Thesterile void becomes the fertile void. I am nothing but function. Nothing equalsreal. The two aspects of the void. - The void (or the unconscious) may be said to havetwo aspects: > · It simply is what it is. > > · It is realised, it is aware of itself, and to speak improperly, this> awareness is \"in us,\" or better, we are \"in it.\" The ultimate transcends human understanding (“no-abode”). - The ultimate sourceof all things is beyond human understanding, beyond the categories of time andspace.

One additional comment: the energy fromwithin and the physical strength from your body can guide you towardaccomplishing your purpose in life - and to actually act on actualising yourduty to yourself. Human beings are integrators. - We do not analyze. We INTEGRATE. The goal of a human being. - The human goal: to actualise oneself. False people. - What I detest most are dishonest people who talk more than theyare capable of doing and also people who use false humility as a means to covertheir obnoxious inadequacy.On the Dominican Republic. - I like the country and the people. The Dominicanshave the simplicity of a real human being; there is not so much hypocrisy likein the big cities. On the nature of human beings.- A human being is an eating, sleeping, physicallymaintaining, reproducing entity. A human being is an entity of feeling. A humanbeing is a creating entity. A human being is the result of a marriage of natural instinct and control. -Here is natural instinct, and there is control. You are to combine the two inharmony. If you have one to the extreme you will be very unscientific; if youhave another to the extreme, you become a mechanical man, no longer a humanbeing. So it is a successful combination of both.

Self-honesty leads to one becoming a “real” human being. - What the hell; youare what you are, and self-honesty occupies a definite and vital part in theever-growing process to become a \"real” human being and not a plastic one.Somehow, one day, you will hear “hey, now that’s quality; here is someone REAL.”I'd like that."},{"pageContent":"Action The necessity for acting on our beliefs. - Knowing is not enough; we must apply.Willing is not enough; we must do.

Only actions give life strength. - Only actions give to life its strength, asonly moderation gives it its charm. Not to think, but to do. - Our grand business is not to see what lies dimly at adistance, but to do what lies clearly at hand.

On not expending one’s powers prematurely. - The work of conservation is shownto be a continuous actualisation and differentiation of form. One does not allowoneself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in one'sstrength, one bides one's time. You do not need special training. - There is no need to exert oneself in specialcultivation outside the daily round of living. Do not expend power prematurely. - Wait in the calm strength of patience - hethat is strong should guard it with tenderness. One need not fear lest strongwill should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powersprematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is notyet ripe.Natural action is pliable. - Nonaction, as it is often translated, does not meanno action, but no such action as begets opposition. “Right\" action is neither tooppose nor to give way, but to be pliable, as a reed in the wind. Wu-wei is spontaneous action. - Spontaneous action - of which Nature (Tao) wasthe grand practitioner. This action of Nature was real action. The second wasaction taken with design, premeditated, and directed to chosen ends. This,however attractive it might seem, was a forcing of Nature and therefore unreal.

It is not his task totry to lead - that would only make him lose the Way-but to let himself be led.If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of acceptance, he is sure to findthe right guidance. The superior man lets himself be guided; he does not goahead blindly, but learns from the situation what is demanded of him and thenfollows. Don't seek, but allow. - Do not seek IT, for it will come when least expected.Let go. Don't seek or run away.On the principle of wu-wei.- Wu-wei is spontaneous superiority. Wu-wei isspontaneous action without prearrangement. Wu-wei ensures the spirit of harmonywith nature. Wu-wei sees no violence done, with the result of peace and freedomfrom disturbance. Wu-wei is the nourishment of the spirit, left alone, so it canfind stability. Wu-wei is \"taking no action;\" all effort made with a purpose aresure to fail. Wu-wei is creative intuition. - The principle of wu-wei is entirely anaction ofcreative intuition, which opens the well-springs WITHIN man. While the action ofassertion, man's common tendency, is preconceptual and rational, it cannotpenetrate the hidden recesses of creativity. The action of assertion is viewedfrom the externals of intellection, while the action of non-assertion isactivated by the inner light.

Themind should be freed from the influence of the external world. To let the mindtake its course unhindered among phenomena.

Don't think-FEEL. Feeling exists here and now when notinterrupted and dissected by ideas or concepts. The moment we stop analyzing andlet go, we can start really seeing, feeling - as one whole. There is no actor orthe one being acted upon but the action itself. I stayed with my feeling then -and I felt it to the full without naming it that. At last the I and the feelingmerged to become one. The I no longer feels the self to be separated from theyou, and the whole idea of taking advantage of getting something out ofsomething becomes absurd. To me, I have no other self (not to mention thought)than the oneness of things of which I was aware at that moment. Abstract analysis is not the answer. - There is too much tendency to look inwardat one's own moods, and to try and evaluate them. To stand on the outside andtry to look inside is futile; whatever was there will go away.

Andall this, I maintain, is taking place in the here and now."},{"pageContent":"Ideas The value of ideas. - Ideas are the beginning of all achievement -- in everyindustry, in every profession. Ideas are what have defined America. - Ideas are what America is looking for.Ideas have made America what she is, and one good idea will make a man what hewants to be. New ideas are always rewarded. - It is a fact that labor and thrift produce acompetence, but fortune, in the sense of wealth, is the reward of the man whocan think of something that hasn't been thought of before. Simple ideas and simple impressions. - Simple ideas are copies of simpleimpressions. For example, I see something exciting and that certain somethingmoves me and because of this impression I can later on have an idea of it.Therefore simple ideas are direct copies of simple impressions and cannot bebroken into parts, but are a uni-fying whole.Complex impressions and complex ideas. - Although complex impressions andcomplex ideas are in general a copy of the other (complex ideas are copies ofcomplex impressions), in some unusual cases, they are not so. For instance, Ican imagine a place where I have never been, or in the case of a man who iscolour blind of the colour blue may make up his idea of that colour with hisexperience of the other colours. Three types of ideas. - Innate ideas (inborn), adventitious ideas (from outsideevents), factitious ideas (which one invents). Four idea principles. -The four idea principles are:> · Find a human need, an unsolved problem> > · Master all of the essentials of the problem> > · Give a new \"twist\" to an old principle> > · Believe in your idea-and act!A five-step process to formulating ideas. > · Gather materials. > > · Masticate the facts. > > · Relax and drop the whole subject. > > · Be ready to recognise and welcome the idea when it comes.> > · Shape and develop your idea into usefulness. On developing the creative attitude. - To develop the creative attitude,analyze, focus on the wanted SOLUTION; seek out and fill your mind with theFACTS; write down IDEAS, both sensible and seemingly wild; let the facts andideas SIMMER in your mind; evaluate, recheck, settle on the CREATIVE IDEAS. An idea emotionalised becomes physical. - Any idea that is constantly held inthe mind and emotionalised, begins at once to clothe itself in the mostconvenient and appropriate physical form that is available. An idea, by itself, is not erroneous. - The thing in which error arrives isjudgment. An idea, by itself, is not erroneous but judgment makes it."},{"pageContent":"Perception Perception is the way of truth.- Not conviction, not method, but perception isthe way of truth. It is a state of effortless awareness, pliable awareness,choiceless awareness. Perception is continuous awareness. - Require not just a moment of perception,but a continuous awareness, a continuous state of inquiry in which there is noconclusion. A wonderful mental exercise. - When you are awake, you must be fully awake andconscious about everything. This is a wonderful mental exercise. The perceiving mind understands truth. - There is no condemnation, no demand fora pattern of action in understanding. You are merely observing-just look at itand watch it. The perceiving mind is living, moving, full of energy, and onlysuch a mind can understand what truth is. To see a thing uncoloured by one's ownpersonal preferences and desires is to see it in its own pristine Simplicity.Perception implies existence to be perceived. - There is always somethingexisting - the genuine object of our perception. Sense data is caused byphysical objects, and yet sense data is not in complete resemblance with thephysical object. Experience, in fact, can be said to be a constant affecting byphysical objects. The relation of sense data to the object being perceived. - Sense data is partof the surface of physical object - one is a function of the other. You can'tdiscard either one of them. What we experience are the effects of physicalobjects. The philosophical problem of perception. - What must the world be like in orderfor us to perceive? What do we perceive? Notes on sense data and perception. - Sense data is caused by physical objects.In order to find out about the actual objects in front of us, reason andrational thinking are necessary. The statement \"I see a T\" means there is(existent object I see) a T (an inference based upon identity of the object).There are physical objectsThe three layers of awareness. - Awareness covers three layers: awareness ofself, the awareness of in-between (zone of fantasy), and awareness of the world.Fear vs. awareness. - The enemy of development is this pain phobia - theunwillingness to do a tiny bit of suffering. As you feel unpleasant youinterrupt the continuum of awareness and you become phobic -- so therapeuticallyspeaking we continue to grow by means of integrating awareness/attention. Choiceless awareness is total comprehension. - Choiceless awareness: non-dualityand reconciliation = TOTAL understanding. The choiceless awareness of a singleand undivided mind. In the watching lies the wonder.- Just watch choicelessly and in the watchinglies the wonder. It is not an ideal, an end to be desired. The watching is astate of \"being\" already, not a state of \"becoming.\" To be a calm beholder. - Be a calm beholder of what is happening around you. Perception is awareness without choice. - There is an awareness without choice,without any demand, an awareness in which there is no anxiety; and in that stateof mind there is perception. It is the perception alone that will resolve allour problems.Choiceless awareness is nonjudgmental observation. - Choiceless awareness-do notcondemn, do not justify. Awareness works only if it's allowed free play withoutinterference. Do not start from a conclusion. - To understand, surely, there must be a stateof choiceless awareness in which there is no sense of comparison orcondemnation, no waiting for a further development of the thing we are talkingabout in order to agree or disagree - don't start from a conclusion above all. \"Pure seeing.” - To see where there is no something (object) this is trueseeing-the seeing is the result of having nothing to stand on. It is simply\"pure seeing,\" beyond subject and object, and therefore \"no-seeing.\""},{"pageContent":"The Ego (Self-Consciousness) Lose the attitude. - Do not have an attitude, open yourself and focus yourselfand express yourself. Reject external form that fails to express internalreality.The ego as obstacle to acceptance. - It is the ego that stands rigidly againstthings coming from the outside, and it is this \"ego rigidity\" that makes itimpossible for us to accept everything that confronts us. On being talented. - Oftentimes people come up to me and ask, \"Bruce, are youreally that good?\" I say, \"Well, if I tell you I'm good, probably you will sayI'm boasting; but if I tell you I'm no good, you'll know I'm lying.\" I have theabsolute confidence not to be number two, but then I have enough sense also torealise that there can be no number one. On social functions. - I don't like to wear stuffy clothes and be at placeswhere everyone is trying to impress each other. The lesson of the ego. - The point to be made about ego is that man should usehis ego and not be used by ego or blinded by it. The ego and self-suggestion. - The ego is fixed entirely by the application ofself-suggestion. Use the ego as a tool. - Those who are materialistic still hold onto the ego asthough it were a possession, rather than using it as a tool. Inwardly,psychologically, be a nobody.Repose in nothing. - Establish nothing in regard to oneself. Let things be whatthey are, move like water, rest like a mirror, respond like an echo, passquickly like the nonexistent, and be quiet as purity. Those who gain, lose. Donot precede others, always follow them. On humbleness. - To be humble to superiors is duty; to equals is courtesy; toinferiors is nobleness; and to all, safety! To be rid of ego-consciousness. - Because one's self-conciousness orego-consciousness is too conspicuously present over the entire range of hisattention - which fact interferes with a free display of whatever proficiency hehas so far acquired or is going to acquire. One should get rid of this obtrudingself - or ego-consciousness - and apply himself to the work to be done as ifnothing particular were taking place at the moment. Most us suffer being self-conscious. -Most us would rather suffer beingself-conscious, being looked upon, than to realise our blindness and get oureyes again - the im-passe is marked by a phobic attitude (avoidance).To be unconsciously conscious is the secret of Nirvana. - To be consciouslyunconscious, or to be unconsciously conscious is the secret of Nirvana. The actis so direct and immediate that intellection finds no room here to insert itselfand cut it to pieces. Ego-consciousness is clinging. - This clinging and possessive ego-consciousness,seeking to affirm itself in \"liberation;\" craftily tires to outwit reality byrejecting the thoughts it \"possesses\" and emptying the mirror of the mind, whichit also \"possesses\"- emptiness itself is regarded as a possession and an\"attainment.\" The ego boundary. -The ego boundary is the differentiation between the self andthe otherness. If the ego boundary is a fixed thing (which it is not) then itagain becomes character, or an armor, like the turtle. Inside and outside the ego boundary. - Inside Ego Boundary there is cohesion,love, cooperation. Outside the Ego Boundary there is suspicion, strangeness,unfamiliarity. Turn into a doll made of wood. - Turn into a doll made of wood-it has no ego, itthinks of nothing, it is not grasping or sticky - and let the body and limbswork themselves out in accordance with the discipline they have undergone.Self-consciousness and duality. - Consciousness of self implies a duality, theobjectivation of a subject which is reflected on an object distinct from itselfor which it creates as such -- a complete liberation from the grip of the past,from all mental habits, and all attachment to our memories. Transcending self-consciousness. - What man has to get over is the consciousness- the consciousness of himself. It is not \"I am doing this,\" but rather an innerrealisation that \"this is happening through me,\" or \"it is doing this for me.\"The consciousness of self is the greatest hindrance to the proper execution ofall physical action. Seeing through ourselves. - We can see through others only when we see throughourselves. Becoming transparent. - Lack of self-awareness renders us transparent. A soulthat knows itself is opaque."},{"pageContent":"Concentration Caution in concentration.- Concentration is a form of exclusion, and where thereis exclusion, there is a thinker who excludes. It is the thinker, the excluder,the one who concentrates, that creates contradiction, because then there is acenter from which there can be a deviation, a distraction.Too much concentration belittles life. - Concentration is a narrowing down ofthe mind - but we are concerned with the total process of living, and toconcentrate exclusively on any particular aspect of life, belittles life. Concentration requires awareness. - A concentrated mind is not an attentivemind, but a mind that is in the state of awareness can concentrate. Awareness isnever exclusive, it includes everything.

Logic deals with declarative sentences. - Logic deals ONLY with declarativesentences, i.e., sentences used for the purpose of making some claim orassertion about the world. The logician. - A logician is not concerned with the process of inference, butwith the propositions which constitute the initial and end points of thatprocess, and the relationship between them. The proposition. - Propositions are either true or false and can be eitheraffirmed or denied. Premises and conclusions. -The conclusion of an argument is that propositionwhich is affirmed on the basis of the other proposition of the argument, andthese other propositions which are affirmed as providing evidence or reasons foraccepting the conclusion are the premises of that argument. However, aproposition standing alone by itself is neither a premise nor a conclusionbecause:> · Premise - an assumption in an argument. > > · Conclusion - what follows from propositions assumed in that argument.The art of the inference. - Inference - a process in which one proposition isarrived at and affirmed on the basis of one or more other propositions, whichwere accepted as the starting point of the process. The argument. - An Argument may be considered to be any group of propositions ofwhich one is claimed to follow from the others, which are regarded as providingevidence for the truth of that one. The structure of an argument is: > · Premise > > · Conclusion The two types of argument. - There are two types of logical arguments: > · Deductive > > · Inductive The deductive argument. - In a deductive argument the truth or falsehood of itsconclusion does not determine the validity or invalidity of an argument. Nordoes the validity of an argument guarantee the truth of its conclusion. The valid argument. - A valid argument is one in which all its premises are trueand, hence, its conclusion is true.The invalid argument. - An invalid argument is one that is not valid because notall of its premises are true. The categorical proposition. - Categorical propositions offer assertions aboutCLASSES, affirming or denying that one class is included in another, either inwhole or in part. For example, consider the syllogism: no athletes arevegetarians; all football players are athletes; therefore, no football playersare vegetarians. The premises and conclusion of the argument stated above areassertions about the class of athletes, and the class of football players. Four standard forms of categorical propositions. - The four standard forms ofcategorical propositions are:> · Universal Affirmative - All S are P. > > · Universal Negative - No S are P.> > · Particular Affirmative -Some S are P.> > · Particular Negative - Some S are not P. It is customary to regard the word \"some\" as meaning \"at least one.\" Posteriori. - Posteriori is: > · An argument from effect to cause. > > · Knowledge based on experiencePriori. -Priori is: > · Argument from cause to effect. > > · Knowledge independent of experience. The analytic proposition. - An analytic proposition is a proposition which isnecessarily true because its denial is self-contradictory (e.g., all barkingdogs bark). The synthetic proposition. - A synthetic proposition is a proposition which isnot self-contradictory and whose denial is not self-contradictory (e.g., alldogs bark). The universal. - A universal is:> · What is common to many different items (e.g., redness is common to all red> things).

The particular.- A particular is:> · Single, individual, as distinct from class or universal. > > · A proposition about part of a subject-class (e.g., some \"s\" is \"p\").The Socratic method. - Plato, through the character of Socrates, has a specificmethod of presenting his position on a given topic. His method of argument beingcom-prised of three steps:> · Starting with certain premises > > · Through a process of reasoning, leading his opponent to > > · His conclusion Dismantling the Socratic method. - The only way to dismantle the so-called\"Socratic method\" of argument is also a three-step process: > · If the truth of the first is challenged successfully> > · And if the remaining premises that are based on the original premise follow> logically > > · The conclusion is false."},{"pageContent":"Emotion Conscience is your pilot. - Recognising that my emotions often err in theiroverenthusiasm, and my faculty of reason often is without the warmth of feelingthat is necessary to enable me to combine justice with mercy in my judgments,I will encourage my conscience to guide me as to what is right and what iswrong, but I will never set aside the verdicts it renders, no matter what may bethe cost of carrying them out. Muscular emotions. - Every emotion expresses itself in the muscular system.Anxiety is tremendous excitement held, bottled up. Anger should be expressed. - Any anger that is not coming out, flowing freely,will turn into sadism, power drive, stammering, and other means of torturing. Motors of behavior. - Emotions - the most important motors of our behavior. Emotions and the subconscious.- The subconscious mind favors thoughts inspiredby emotional feelings. It also gives preference to dominating thoughts.Emotions are both positive and negative. - Realising that my emotions are bothPositive and negative, I will form daily Habits which will encourage thedevelopment of the positive emotions and aid me in converting the negativeemotions into some form of useful action."},{"pageContent":"Happiness Happiness is the moral measure of man. - The measure of the moral worth of a manis his happiness.

But most of all, I like books. I readall types of books - fiction and nonfiction.True fortune is a wonderful spouse. - I think when a couple marry, they eithergo into heaven or live in hell. They may live a fairy-tale-like life, or theymay suffer a lot. I am a fortunate man. I am fortunate not because my films havebroken box-office records in various parts of the world, but because I have agood wife, Linda. She is unsurpassed. Why do I say this? First, I believe acouple should develop a kind of friendship. Linda and I have this kind offriendship. We understand each other, like a pair of good friends.

Sensitivity and fear. - Sensitivity is not possible if you are afraid of this,that, etc.Initiative and fear. - There can be no initiative if one has fear, and fearcompels us to cling to tradition, gurus, etc. Intelligence vs. authority. - The inner authority game-authority destroysintelligence. Shame is fear of humiliation. - Shame is fear of humiliation at one's inferiorstatus in the estimation of others. There is fear and insecurity in pride. - Pride emphasises the importance of thesuperiority of one's status in the eyes of others.

Thenprotection of his status appears to be his most important need, and this createsanxiety. The fear of not being esteemed by others. -The inner self is the true self. Inorder to realise our true self we must be willing to live without beingdependent upon the opinion of others. When we are completely self-sufficient wecan have no fear of not being esteemed by others.The more we value things, the less we value our selves. - We should devoteourselves to being self-sufficient and must not depend upon the external ratingby others for our happiness.

I will exercise it daily when I need the urge toaction for any purpose, and I will form habits designed to bring the power of mywill into action at least once daily.The yielding will has a reposeful ease. -The yielding will has a reposeful ease,soft as downy feathers; a quietude, a shrinking from action. An appearance ofinability to do (the heart is humble, but the work is forceful). Placidly freefrom anxiety, one acts in harmony with nature; one moves and revolves in theline of creation. The will to win. -The attitude \"That you can win if you want to badly enough\"means that the will to win is constant and no amount of punishment, no amount ofeffort, or no condition is too \"tough\" to take in order to win. Such an attitudecan be developed only if winning is closely tied to the practitioner's idealsand dreams. Experience shows that an athlete who forces himself to the limit,can keep going as long as necessary. It means that ordinary effort will not tapor release the tremendous store of reserve power latent in the human body.Extraordinary effort, highly emotionalised conditions, or a true determinationto win at all costs will release this extra energy. Therefore an athlete isactually as tired as he feels, and if he is determined to win he can keep onalmost indefinitely in order to achieve his objective. Morality vs. authority. - I can walk away from millions because it's not right,but I'll be damned if I'll back up an inch from a dime because it has to be so.The issue of free will. - Is free will caused by our own volition or by God(this is a theological problem of the Middle Ages) or is it governed by causallaw (the term \"free\" then becomes the grandson of \"chance\"). If human actionsare governed by causal law, the problem then becomes that there are no actionsthat are voluntary. The will can be lethal. - There is no weapon more deadly than the will. The will and woman.- Unquestionably man has his will-but woman has her way! The will is spiritual. - The spiritual power of man's will removes allobstacles. The hero is the self-willed man. - What does self-willed mean? Does it not mean''having a will of one's own?\" The human herd instinct demands adaptation andsub-ordination, but for his highest honor man elects not the meek, thepusillanimous, the supine, but precisely the self-willed man, the heroes. Selfwill is not governed by external laws. - Selfwill seems to be the onlyvirtue that takes no account of man-made laws.Having one’s own will. - What does self-willed mean? Hell, isn't it knowingabove all, that, indeed, one is the captain of one's soul, the master of one'slife? Now what causes such realisation and, consequently, brings about a changein one's behavior? TO BE REAL, TO ACCEPT RESONSIBILITY FOR ONESELF. The aim of the self-willed man is growth. - A self-willed man has no other aimthan his own growth. He values only one thing, the mysterious power in himselfwhich bids him live and helps him to grow.

The spiritual force transcends all. - I feel I have this great creative andspiritual force within me that is greater than faith, greater than ambition,greater than confidence, greater than determination, greater than vision. It isall these combined. My brain becomes magnetised with this dominating force whichI hold in my hand. Intensity/enthusiasm is the god within. -Intensity and/or enthusiasm is this godwithin us-one that instinctively becomes the art of the physical \"becoming\" andwithin this transition we no longer care to know what life means.

The spirit of the individual isdetermined by his dominating thought habits. On the divisiveness of organised religion. - Religions divide people, just asstyles [in martial art] divide people. If all the religions of the world wereone, the world would be united in brotherhood. Some people fight with othersbecause they believe in different religions. If, however, they only gave thematter a bit of thought, they would never fight for such a foolish cause. The problem with organised religion. - The source of trouble in religion is toattribute to the cause with doctrines, rules, and prejudices. Between heaven and earth. - If you ask me, what will I do in heaven? I will saythis: There are many things in this life I have not finished. Why should I thinkabout something so far away? The spirit is strengthened in sorrow. -Happiness is good for the body, butsorrow strengthens the spirit. Character is the form of the soul. - Character is to the soul what outwardappearance is to the body. A man's genuineness and refinement should not revealthemselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as an effectfrom within. Let the spiritual grow up through the common. -Live content with small means;seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion. Be worthy,not respectable, wealthy, not rich; study hard, think quietly, talk gently, actfrankly; bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never. In aword, let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common. Let the spirit out. - Discard all thoughts of reward, all hopes of praise andfears of blame, all awareness of one's bodily self. And, finally closing theavenues of sense perception, let the spirit out, as it will. The spirit controls the body. -The active is controlled by the inactive - theactive being form or matter, and the inactive being spirit or mind. Minimise inwardly. - It is not difficult to trim and hack off the unessential inoutward physical structure. However, to shun away, to minimise inwardly isanother matter. The spirit is formless.- According to Zen, the spirit is by nature formless andno \"objects\" are to be harbored in it. When anything is harbored there, psychicenergy loses its l balance, its native activity becomes cramped, and it no Ilonger flows with the stream. Where the energy is tipped, there is too much ofit in one direction and a shortage of it in another direction. Where there istoo much energy, it overflows and cannot be controlled. In either case, it isunable to cope with ever-changing situations. But when there prevails a state ofpurposelessness (which is also a state of fluidity or mindlessness), the spiritharbors nothing in it, nor is it tipped in one direction; it transcends bothsubject and object; it responds empty-mindedly to whatever is happening. The end of spiritual training.- Not to localise or partialise is the end ofspiritual training. When it is nowhere it is everywhere. When it occupiesone-tenth, it is absent in the other nine-tenths. Let a person disciplinehimself to have the mind go on its own way, instead of trying deliberately toconfine it somewhere.

On smoking, drinking and gambling. - I don't drink nor smoke and those eventsare many times senseless. I'm not a smoker because I don't think putting smokeinto your body is quite the thing to do. As for alcohol, I think it tastesawful. Don't know why anyone should want to drink the stuff As for gambling, Idon't believe in getting something for nothing. Health is a state of balance. - Health is an appropriate balance of thecoordination of all of what we are (are is being mind rather than having mind).A healthy person has both a good orientation (sensoric system) and ability toact (motoric system). So if there is no balance between sensing and doing, thenyou are out of gear."},{"pageContent":"Courtship Courtship is not always the proper prelude to matrimony. - Courtship is notalways the proper prelude to marriage.

Many successful marriages are made in college. - Many successful Americanmarriages are made in college.

Absence in love.- Absence in love is like water upon fire; a little quickens,but much extinguishes it. Love and ego. - Love is an egotism of two. The question.- I'm loved? Loving well and loving wisely. - I did love like a madman, but have enough senseto not love as a fool. It isn't so easy to love too well and so difficult tolove wisely. Young love vs. mature love. - Young love is a flame: very pretty, often very hotand fierce, but still only light and flickering. The love of the older anddisciplined heart is as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable. Love is mathematically just. - Love, and you shall be loved - all love ismathematically just, as much as the two sides of an algebraic equation."},{"pageContent":" Marriage Marriage is a friendship. - Marriage is a friendship, a partnership basedsolidly upon ordinary, everyday occurrences. Marriage is caring for children. -Marriage is caring for children, watching overthem in sickness, training them in the way they must go, sharing worry aboutthem and pride in them. Marriage is everyday life. - Marriage is breakfast in the morning, work duringthe day - the husband at his work, the wife at hers - dinner at night, and quietevenings together talking, reading, or watching television. Marriage derived from everyday life lasts longer. -The happiness we have todayis built on the ordinary life we had before we married. The happiness that isderived from ordinary life lasts longer; like coal, it burns gradually andslowly. The happiness that is derived from excitement is like a brilliantfire-soon it will go out. Many young couples live a very exciting life when theyare in love. So, when they marry, and their lives are reduced to calmness anddullness, they will feel impatient and will drink the bitter cup of a sadmarriage. In marriage: 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. - [My wife] and I aren't one and one. We are twohalves that make a whole. You have to apply yourself to be a family - two halvesfitted together are more efficient than either half would ever be alone! Love without conditions. - The quality in Linda that moves me is herunconditional love for me. She treats our relationship with calmness [and]objectivity, and without conditions. I think this is the kind of attitude that acouple should adopt. For example, if I state a point, my wife will express herideas on it. Certainly we ought to discuss things or it would be difficult forus to get along well. The importance of acknowledging your love. - A very important person I like tothank. A quality human being in her own right-giving, loving, stalwart,understanding this animal, Bruce Lee. And letting him simply be. My companion inour separate but intertwined pathways of growth, a definite enricher of my life,the woman I love; and - fortunately for me - my wife.

The aim of education. - Education: to discover but not merely to imitate.Learning techniques without inward experiencing can only lead to superficiality. Education need not be formal.- But then, how important is school? I barely madepassing grades while attending the University of Washington. Absorption vs. accumulation in education. - It is not how much you have learned,but how much you have absorbed in what you have learned - the best techniquesare the simple ones executed right."},{"pageContent":"Teaching Teaching requires a sensitive mind with great flexibility. Above all, a teacherdoes not depend on a method and drill systematic routines; instead, he studieseach individual student and awakens him to explore himself, both internally andexternally, and ultimately integrate himself with his being. Such teaching,which is really no teaching, requires a sensitive mind with great flexibilityand is difficult to come by nowadays. A teacher is a pointer to truth, not a giver of truth. - A teacher, a goodteacher that is, functions as a pointer to truth, but not a giver of truth. Heemploys a minimum of form to lead his student to the formless. Furthermore, hepoints out the importance of being able to enter a mold without being imprisonedby it, or to follow the principles without being bound by them. The teacher cannot be fixed in a routine. - A good teacher cannot be fixed in aroutine. He must not impose his student to fit a lifeless pattern, apreformulation. The most difficult thing to teach. - A good teacher protects his pupils from hisown influence. It is easy to teach one to be skillful, but it is difficult toteach him his own attitude. Each moment during teaching requires a full alertand sensitive mind that is constantly adjusting and constantly changing. Put my words to the test. - Remember, I am no teacher; I can merely be asignpost for a traveler who is lost. It is up to you to decide on the direction.All I can offer is an experience but never a conclusion, so even what I havesaid needs to be thoroughly examined by you. I might be able to help you todiscover and examine your problem by awakening your awareness of their cause andeffect, but I cannot teach you, for I am not a teacher, and I have no style. Idon't believe in system, nor in method. And without system, without method,what's to teach? The ideal teacher. - Not \"what\" to think but ''how\" to think. [Education] afterall, it is merely the root to function from. Look for ways to raise the pupil'smind above duality, to the absolute awareness which transcends it. The six principle steps of teaching. > · Motivation of the trainee > > · Maintaining their complete attention> > · Promoting mental activity (thinking) - discussion, question, lecture > > · Creating a clear picture of material to be learned; outlining the material > > · Developing comprehension of the significance, the implications, and the> practical application of the material being presented (clear goals)> > · Repetition of the five preceding steps until learning has taken place Give recognition where due. - Give recognition where it is due. Complementsdefinitely stimulate more effort and desire to improve. Be generous with honestpraising. Teaching is a direct relationship. - I never believe in large organisations,with their domestic and foreign branches, affiliations, etc. To reach themasses, some sort of a system is required; as a result, the members areconditioned according to that system. I believe in teaching just a few, as itrequires constant alert observations on each individual in order to establish atrue, direct relationship. The spiritually deficient search for external securities. - The poorer we areinwardly, the more we try to enrich ourselves outwardly. There is no fixed teaching. - There is no fixed teaching. All I can provide isan appropriate medicine for a particular ailment. I present a possibledirection, nothing more. It is like a finger pointing away to the moon; don'tconcentrate on the finger or you will miss all that heavenly glory. Sincere students are rare. - Sincere and serious learners are difficult to comeby. Many of them are five minute enthusiasts, some of them come in with illintentions, but unfortunately, most of them are second-hand artists; basicallyconformers."},{"pageContent":"Ethics On right conduct. -Right conduct is governed by reason and creativity. The “good life” is a process.- The good life is a process, not a state of being.It is a direction, not a destination. The good life constitutes a directionselected by the total organism, when there is psychological freedom to move inANY direction. Objective standards require knowledge. - In order to establish the objectivestandard of correct conduct, knowledge is to be acquired. There are no “means to ends.” - There will never be means to ends, only means.And I am means. I am what I started with, and when it is all over I will be allthat is left of me. All goals, apart from the means are therefore an illusion,and becoming is a denial of being. Enrich your understanding. - Don't be in a hurry to \"fix\" things; rather, enrichyour understanding in the ever-going process of discovery and finding more thecause of your Ignorance. Happiness is the appropriate moral behavior for the appropriate situation. -Being able to find the correct conduct for a special situation is happiness -not a strict standard for every situation. Understanding, not a snap judgment, is required. - It need not be an immediatereaction of what [you] have heard that requires an immediate evaluation orjudgement, rather shouldn't it be understanding of it, the whole situation,totally suffice? Three most difficult things. -The three things most difficult are:> · To keep a secret > > · To forget an injury > > · To make good use of leisure.> > Moral conduct: considerations on relative and absolute applications. - To holdmoral conduct as absolute might be to hold that action is described in any oldway. It might be to hold that action described in a certain way is applicable toall at all times. To hold it as relative, might be to hold it as the variousfunction of time, geographic climate, social and economical needs, religiousbeliefs, etc. To hold it as relative might be to hold that the expression ofright conduct might mean right conduct is the dictate of public interest, etc.To hold it as absolute might be to hold that expressing right conduct can bedefined invariably. Concerning objective and subjective value judgments.- A judgment is objective ifit concerns objective questions; a subjective judgment is one which concernsone's personal view on the objective. Objective is factual. Subjective is amatter of opinion. There is a big difference between why you THINK something iswrong and to justify, explaining, proving that something is wrong. A concept isobjective if the quality denoted is the actual quality of action (inherent inthe objective). The two primary moral questions. -There are two sorts of problems concerningmoral issues:> · Where does good or bad action derive from? > > · What makes an action bad or good? The trouble of man. - Honor and disgrace are alike a cause of excitement. Thetrouble of man lies in the love for self. Poverty and peace. - Any poor country or person is hostile while they are down.If you have nothing, you can afford to be hostile. But wait until they, too,become more prosperous. They will soon quiet down and want peace just like therest of the world. Humility leads to honor. - Humility forms the basis of honor, just as the lowground forms the foundation of a high elevation. The four ethical theories. - There are four different ethical theories:> · Objective Theory of Ethics - that goodness is objective (Plato's theory) and> cannot be further deduced.> > · Consequential Theory of Ethics - that what makes an action good is its> outcome (utilitarianism for instance); the most pleasure for the most people> (more believable than objectivism as mentioned).> > · Motivational Theory of Ethics - that moral character of an action springs> from a motive of the actor - it is not a bad action so long as a person has> good intentions (Immanuel Kant is one of the motivational theorists; he said> “do not perform any action that you cannot rationalise for people to act all> the time.\")> > · Approbative Theory of Ethics - to say that an action is good or bad depends> on the approval of others. The intrinsic value of the good and beautiful. -To value them all by themselves.Not to value them in their manifestation.

But ifanyone still believes in racial differences, I think he is too backward andnarrow. Perhaps he still does not understand man's equality and love. Under the heavens there is but one family. - Basically, human traits are thesame everywhere. I don't want this to sound like \"As Confucius say,\" but underthe sky, under the heavens, there is but one family. Tradition is the root of racism. - Many people are still bound by tradition;when the elder generation says \"no\" to something, then these other people willstrongly disapprove of it as well. If the elders say that something is wrong,then they also will believe that it is wrong. They seldom use their mind to findout the truth and seldom express sincerely their real feeling. The simple truthis that these opinions on such things as racism are traditions, which arenothing more than a \"formula\" laid down by these elder people's experience. Aswe progress and time changes, it is necessary to reform this formula. Being free of tradition, one holds no prejudice.- I, Bruce Lee, am a man whonever follows these formulas of the fear-mon-gers. So, no matter if your colouris black or white, red or blue, I can still make friends with you without anybarrier."},{"pageContent":"Adversity Adversity is beneficial to us. - Prosperity is apt to prevent us from examiningour conduct; but adversity leads us to think properly of our state, and so isbeneficial to us. Adversity causes the mind to think properly. - In a time when everything goeswell, my mind is pampered with enjoyment, possessiveness, etc. Only in times ofadversity, privation, or mishap, does my mind function and think properly of mystate. This close examination of self strengthens my mind and leads me tounderstand and be understood. The value of foolish questions. - A wise man can learn more from a foolishquestion than a fool can learn from a wise answer. Never waste energy on worries and negative thoughts. - I mean who has the mostinsecure job as I have? What do I live on? My faith in my ability that I'll makeit. Sure my back screwed me up good for a year but with every adversity comes ablessing because a shock acts as a reminder to oneself that we must not getstale in routine. Anxiery is a defense. - Don't be forecasting evil unless it is what you canguard against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can't turn it into a defense. There is no shame in losing. - It is not a shame to be knocked down by otherpeople. The important thing is to ask when you're being knocked down, \"Why am Ibeing knocked down?\" If a person can reflect in this way, then there is hope forthis person. To be able to do the things we want sometimes requires the performance of a fewwe don't. -Just as the maintaining of good health may require the taking ofunpleasant medicine, so the condition of being able to do the things we enjoyoften requires the performance of a few we don't. Remember my friend that it isnot what happens that counts, it is how you react to them. Your mental attitudel determines what you make of it, either a stepping stone or stumbling block. Sorrow as educator. - Sorrows are our best educator. A man can see furtherthrough a tear than a telescope. The forms of stupidity. - Stupidity assumes two forms, it speaks or is silent.Mute stupidity is bearable. The world is full of troublemakers. - The world is full of people who aredetermined to be somebody or give trouble. They want to get ahead to stand out.Such ambition has no use for a man of Tao, who rejects all forms ofself-as-sertiveness and competition.Adversity shocks you to higher levels. - With adversity you are shocked tohigher levels, much like a rain storm that is so violent, but yet afterwards allplant grows. Adversity is like a rainfall. - Adversity is like the period of the former andof the latter rain: cold, comfortless, unfriendly to man and to animal; yet fromthat season have their birth the flower and the fruit, the date, the rose, andthe pomegranate. Defeat is education. - What is defeat? Nothing but education; nothing but thefirst step to something better. In solitude you are least alone. - Loneliness is only an opportunity to cutadrift and find yourself In solitude you are least alone. Make good use it. The value of frustration. - Without frustration you will not discover that youmight be able to do something on your own. We grow through conflict. Bear insults patiently. - There is nothing that will enable you to pursue yourcourse in greater peace than the patient bearing of insult. Patience is notpassive, on the con-trary it is concentrated strength. Be cautious whom you trust. - Don't easily trust anyone on this earth becausethere are all kinds. The wise can draw advantage from mishap. - No accidents are so unlucky but thatthe wise may draw some advantage from them; nor are there any so lucky but thatthe foolish may turn them to their own prejudice. Anxiety. - Anxiety is the gap between the NOW and the THEN So if you are in theNOW, you can't be anxious, because your excitement flows immediately intoongoing spontaneous activity. The critic. - Empty heads have long tongues. Commonly they, whose tongue istheir weapon, use their feet for defense. There are always obstacles on the road to achievement. - Believe me that inevery big thing or achievement there are always obstacles, big or small, and thereaction one shows to such obstacles is what counts, not the obstacleitself. There is no such thing as defeat until you admit so yourself, but notuntil then! Inner resistance is not the solution. -Whether I like it or not, circumstancesare thrust upon me, and being a fighter at heart I sort of fight it in thebeginning but soon realise what I need is not inner resistance and needlessconflict (in the form of dissipation); rather, by joining forces to readjust andmake the best of it. Don’t add worry to your troubles. - Serene, detached from all results, ready tofight or run, to win or lose, and always ready to laugh at all things, takewhatever comes. Your child is ill you say, or you cannot pay the rent? Verywell, accept these facts and face them. Are they not trouble enough inthemselves without adding the aggravation of worry to them? You cannot clear muddied water with your hand. - Who is there that can makemuddy water clear? But if allowed to remain still, it will become clear ofitself Who is there that can secure a state of absolute repose? But keep calmand let time go on, and the state of repose will gradually arrest. Worry only creates problems for those around you. - One who is possessed byworry not only lacks the poise to solve his own problems, but by his nervousnessand irritability creates additional problems for those around him. Learn to walk on. - Why add the tension of emotion/ thought to a situation whichis illusion, to the extent that it is real, of a passing moment (in any event,the result of previous causes)? Do what seems wise to be done, forget it, andwalk on. Walk on and see a new view. Walk on and see the birds fly. Walk on andleave behind all things that would dam up the inlet, or clog the outlet, ofexperience."},{"pageContent":"Confrontation Avoid trials of skill. - Avoid trials of skill; at first it's all friendlinessbut in the end it's all antagonism. Avoid distraction and rivalry. - Shut out all forms of distraction. Eliminateall opportunities for rivalry. On people who “challenge.\" - These people must have something wrong in theirhearts. For if their heart was right, they would not challenge other people tofight. Moreover, most of these people challenge because they feel insecure andwant to use a fight as a means to achieve some unknown aim. Do not anticipate the outcome. - The great mistake is to anticipate the outcomeof the engagement; you ought not to be thinking of whether it ends in victory orin defeat. On being challenged. - I have learned that being challenged means one thing andthat is what is your reaction to it? How does it affect you? Now if you aresecure within yourself, you treat it very, very lightly. Because you askyourself: Am I really afraid of that man? Or Do I have any doubt within me thathe is going to get me? And if I do not have such doubt, and if I do not havesuch fear, I would certainly treat it very lightly - just as today the rain isgoing on strong, but tomorrow, baby, the sun is going to come out again. All disputes can be settled by law. - Nowadays you don't go around on the streetkicking people or punching people, because if you do [someone will simply pullout a gun and] - bang! That's it. I don't care how good you are in martial art.Today everything can be settled by law. Even if you want to avenge your father,you need not challenge one to a fight. You control the confrontation. - No one can hurt you unless you allow him to. See through the illusion. -See that there is no one to fight, only an illusionto see through. Be aware of illusions! The need for transcendence. - A struggle of any nature can never be settledsatisfactorily until the absolute fact is touched. Where neither opponent canaffect the other. Not neutrality, not indifference, but TRANSCENDENCE is thething needed."},{"pageContent":"Adaptability On the nature of adaptation. -What is adaptation? It is like the immediacy ofthe shadow adjusting itself to the moving body. The importance of adaptation. - The inability to adapt brings destruction. Adaptation is stillness in movement. - The stillness in stillness is not thereal stillness; only when there is stillness in movement does the universalrhythm manifest. Adaptation is wisdom. - Wisdom does not consist in trying to wrest the good fromthe evil but in learning to \"ride\" them as a cork adapts itself to the crestsand troughs of the waves. The adaptive mind. - That of not being tense but ready, not thinking but notdreaming, not being rigidly set but flexible. Aware and alert, ready forwhatever may come. Be flexible to change with change. - Be flexible so you can change with change.Empty yourself Open up! After all, the usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness. Change is changeless. - To change with change 1s the changeless state. Stillness in movement. - The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness,only when there is stillness in movement does the universal rhythm manifest. On interchangeability. - The flow of movements is in their interchangeability. Adaptability is intelligence. - Intelligence is sometimes defined as thecapacity of the individual to adjust himself successfully to his environment, orto adjust the environment to his needs. Bend and survive. - There is another bit of Chinese philosophy that has abearing on problems common to all human kind. We say, \"The oak tree is mighty,yet it will be destroyed by a mighty wind because it resists the elements; thebamboo bends with the wind, and by bending, survives.\" The Parable of the Butcher. - There was a fine butcher who used the same knifeyear after year, yet it never lost its delicate, precise edge. After a lifetimeof service, it was still as useful and effective as when it was new. When askedhow he had preserved his knife's fine edge, he said. “I follow the line of thehard bone. I do not attempt to cut it, nor to smash it, nor to contend with itin any way. That would only destroy my knife.\" In daily living, one must followthe course of the barrier. To try to assail it will only destroy the instrument.And no matter what some people will say, barriers are not the experience of anyone person, or any one group of persons. They are the universal experience. Adapt like water. - Be like water; water has form and yet it has no form. It isthe softest element on earth, yet it penetrates the hardest rock. It has noshape of its own, yet it can take any shape in which it is placed. In a cup, itbecomes the shape of the cup. In a vase, it takes the shape of the vase andcurls about the stems of flowers. Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.Please observe the adaptability of water. If you squeeze it fast, the water willflow out quickly. If you squeeze it slowly, it will come out slowly. Water mayseem to move in contradiction, even uphill, but it chooses any way open to it sothat it may reach the sea. It may flow swiftly or it may flow slowly, but itspurpose is inexorable, its destiny sure."},{"pageContent":"Philosophy Study philosophy. - Read all kinds of the books of man - the central themes, thestyles, the advantages, the disadvantages. The importance of reading. - Reading, specialised reading, is the mental food. On philosophy. - Philosophy has been defined throughout the years as the \"Loveof Wisdom.\" Its purpose is to investigate things through a process of logicalthinking and reasoning. Philosophy has no interest in \"how,\" rather it isconcerned with \"what\" and \"why.\" The pleasures of philosophy.- When I enrolled in the University of Washingtonand was enlightened by philosophy, I regretted all my previous immatureassumptions. My majoring in philosophy was closely related to the pugnacity ofmy childhood. I often ask myself these questions:> · What comes after victory? > > · Why do people value victory so much? > > · What is \"glory''? > > · What kind of\"victory\" is \"glorious\"? Philosophy reveals what man lives for. - When my tutor assisted me in choosingmy courses, he advised me to take up philosophy because of my inquisitiveness.He said, “philosophy will tell you what man lives for.\" On the process of Western philosophy. -The process of philosophy is to get orobtain clear information on virtually any topic, but certain philosophers, suchas Plato, have as their focal point the realm of ethics and morality.Specifically, issues that deal with \"good\" and \"bad,\" what constitutes the\"ideal life\" that one ought to strive for. Philosophy is in danger of becoming something that is simply professed. - Manyphilosophers are among those who say one thing and do another, and thephilosophy that a man professes is often quite other than the one he livesby Philosophy, therefore, is in danger of becoming more and more only somethingprofessed. Living vs. theorising. - Philosophy is not \"living\" but an activity concerningtheoretic knowledge, and most philosophers are not going to live things, butsimply to theorise about them, to contemplate them. And to contemplate a thingimplies maintaining oneself outside it, resolved to keep a distance between itand ourselves. The disease of philosophy. - Philosophy is itself the disease for which itpretends to be the cure: the wise man does not pursue wisdom but lives his life,and therein precisely does his wisdom lie. Philosophy often strives to convert reality into a problem. - In life, we acceptnaturally the full reality of what we see and feel in general with no shadow ofa doubt. Philosophy, however, does not accept what life believes, and strives toconvert reality into a problem. Like asking such questions as: \"Is this chairthat I see in front of me really there?\" \"Can it exist by itself?\" Thus, ratherthan making life easy for living by living in accord with life, philosophycomplicates it by replacing the world's tranquillity with the restlessness ofproblems. Rationalism. -Rationalism is related to Intuitionism. The rationalist holds thatreason is capable of grasping basic truths intuitively and deriving other truthsfrom them by rational procedures, logical demonstration. In less extreme forms,reason and reason's evidence are necessary to distill out of sense experience,or impart to sense experience universal necessary laws. Empiricism. - Empiricism emphasises the importance of experience in knowledge.Recent empiricists tend to give a larger role to reason in the organisation ofknowledge, stressing scientific method (with its theoretical, mathematical,conceptual structure, as well as its experimental approach) as contrasted withsimple perception. They emphasise the tentative, hypothetical-experimental, andself-corrective character of science. On Existentialism. - Existentialism wants to do away with concepts, and to workon the awareness principle, on phenomenology. The set back with the presentexistentialist philosophies is that they need their support from somewhere else.If you look at the existentialists, they say that they are nonconceptual, but ifyou look at the people, they all borrow concepts from other sources.

If it is a piece of junk, I will only regretit. It’s not the job, but how you do it.- It's not what you give, it's the way yougive it. The reward should be proportionate to the work. - No one ever does anything withenthusiasm unless he benefits thereby - reward proportionately. Intense desire creates its own talents and opportunities. - We are told thattalent creates its own opportunities. But it sometimes seems that intense desirecreates not only its own opportunities, but its own talents. Two ways of making a good living. - There are two ways of making a good living.One is the result of hard working, and the other, the result of the imagination(requires work, too, of course).

No man is defeated unless he isdiscouraged. The problem is in anticipation of suffering. - Suffering itself does lessafflict the senses than the anticipation of suffering. Become what you think. -What you HABITUALLY THINK largely determines what youwill ultimately become. Know the difference between a catastrophe and an inconvenience. -To realise thatit's just an inconvenience, that it is not a catastrophe, but just anunpleasantness, is part of coming into your own, part of waking up. Stumbling blocks and stepping stones. - Are you going to make your obstaclesstepping stones to your dreams, or stumbling blocks because unknowingly you letnegativeness, worries, fear, etc., take over you? The change is from inner to outer. - We start by dissolving our attitude not byaltering outer conditions. Refuse to stay down. - In Chinese variety stores we have a weighted dog, likeyour weighted clowns, which points out a moral: \"Fall down nine times, but riseagain ten times.\" To refuse to be cast down, that is the lesson. Choose the positive. - You have your choice - you are master of your attitude -choose the POSITIVE, the CONSTRUCTIVE. Optimism is a faith that leads tosuccess. Cease negative mental chattering. - If you think a thing is impossible, you'llmake it impossible. Pessimism blunts the tools you need to succeed."},{"pageContent":"Goals Goals give life substance. - To strive actively to achieve some goal gives yourlife meaning and substance. Three questions. - Come to some sort of realisation as to whatever your pursuitmight be. In my case, it has been the pursuit of becoming, moment to moment. Andconstantly questioning myself: \"What is this, Bruce?\" \"Is it true or not true?\"\"Do you really mean it or not mean it?\" Once I've found that out, that's it. A goal is not always meant to be reached. - A goal is not always meant to bereached. It often serves simply as something to aim at. Don't fear failure. -Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attemptsit is glorious even to fail. The first rule of achieving your goal. - Know what you want. I know my idea isright, and, therefore, the results would be satisfactory. I don't really worryabout the reward, but to set in motion the machinery to achieve it. Mycontribution will be the measure of my reward and success. When you drop apebble into a pool of water, the pebble starts a series of ripples that expanduntil they encompass the whole pool. This is exactly what will happen when Igive my ideas a definite plan of action. Thoughts are things. - Thoughts are things, in the sense that thought can betranslated into its physical equivalent. Mixing thought with definiteness of purpose. - I begin to appreciate now the oldsaying “he can because he thinks he can.\" I believe that anybody can thinkhimself into his goal if he mixes thought with definiteness of purpose,persistence; and a burning desire for its translation into reality. Daily progress.- Make at least one definite move daily toward your goal. The future can give you happiness. -The past is history and only the future cangive you happiness. So, everybody must prepare for their future and create theirown future. One rarely reaches the goal in one step. - The control of our being is notunlike the combination of a safe. One turn of the knob rarely unlocks the safe.Each advance and retreat is a step toward one's goal. Attitude determines altitude. - You will never get any more out of life than youexpect. Every man today is the result of his thoughts of yesterday. Always keep your goals in focus. - Keep your mind on the things you want and offthose you don't."},{"pageContent":"Faith Faith vs. doubt. -I respect faith, but doubt is what gets you an education. To act on faith. - Faith without work is death. Applied faith. - Faith backed by action is applied faith. The power of faith. - Thoughts backed by faith will over come all obstacles. Faith in oneself -What do I live on? My faith in my ability that I'll make it.Faith makes it possible to achieve that which man's mind can conceive andbelieve. It is a well-known fact that one comes, finally, to believe whateverone repeats to one's self, whether the statement be true or false. If a manrepeats a lie over and over, he will eventu-ally accept the lie as truth.Moreover, he'll believe it to be the truth. Every man is what he is because ofthe dominating thoughts which he permits to occupy his mind. Faith is a state of mind. - Faith is a state of mind that can be conditionedthrough self-discipline. Faith will accomplish. Cultivating faith. -Faith can be induced or created by affirmation or repeatedinstructions to the subconscious mind through the principle of autosuggestion.This is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith. Faith and reason. - I cannot and will not \"scoff\" at faith when reason seems tobe such a barren thing. Faith maintains the soul. - Faith is the maintaining of the soul through whichone's aims may be translated into their physical equivalent."},{"pageContent":"Success Success -- a definition. Success means doing something sincerely andwhole-heartedly. And you have to have the help of other people to achieve it. Success is not luck. - I don't believe in pure luck. You have to create your ownluck. You have to be aware of the opportunities around you and take advantage ofthem. Success is when preparation meets opportunity. - Opportunities may come your wayor they may not. Luck may come your way or it may not. But if they come your way- and you call that luck-you'd better be ready for it! On being success-conscious. - Probably, people will say I'm too conscious ofsuccess. Well, I am not. Success comes to those who become success-conscious. Ifyou don't aim at an object, how the heck on earth do you think you can get it? Climbing the ladder of success is a fantasy. - As for the idea of climbinghigher [up the ladder of success], I think that it is very absurd; it is only afantasy. It cannot be obtained just by sitting here and speculating. Althoughtoday I am successful, I will still continue to discover myself. But whether Ican \"climb higher\" is still a fantasy. The price of success.- He who wants to succeed should learn how to fight, tostrive, and to suffer. You can acquire a lot in life, if you are prepared togive up a lot to get it. The biggest disadvantage of success. -The biggest disadvantage of success islosing your privacy. It's ironic but we all strive to become wealthy and famous,but once you're there, it's not all rosy. Success complicates simplicity. -To many, the word \"success\" seems to be aparadise, but now that I'm in the midst of it, it is nothing but circumstancesthat seem to complicate my innate feeling toward simplicity and privacy. Success is not a destination. - Remember, success is a journey, not adestination. Have faith in your ability. You will do just fine. The eternal condition of success. - A purpose is the eternal condition ofsuccess. The three keys to success. - Persistence, persistence, and persistence. ThePower can be created and maintained through daily practice - continuous effort."},{"pageContent":"Money The nature of money. - Money of itself has no explicit nature. Money is what onemakes of it. Money is a means, not an end. - A child must be taught early that money is onlya means, a type of usefulness, an implement. Like all instruments, it hascertain purposes, but it will not do everything. One must learn how to use it,what it will do, but above all what it will not do. Money is an indirect matter. - My policy is that money is an indirect matter.The direct matter is your ability or what you are going to do that counts. Ifthat comes, the indirect things will follow. A fair share of the profit. - Many film producers think I am only interested inmoney. That's why they all try to lure me on to their set by promising me hugesums and nothing else. But, at heart, I only want a fair share of the profit. The good times will not always last.- I profited from my father's philosophyabout money. He used to tell me, \"If you make 10 dollars this year, always thinkto yourself that next year you may only make five dollars -so be prepared.\" Keep money in perspective. -Sure money is important in providing for my familyand giving us what we want. But it isn't everything. Enjoying your work is the important thing. -At [one] time I wanted all theindirect things - money, fame, the big opening nights. Now I have it, or ambeginning to get it, the whole thing doesn't seem important any more. I havefound that doing a thing is more important. I am having fun doing it. Moneycomes second."},{"pageContent":"Fame On the illusion of stardom. -A \"star\" is an illusion. Man, is that somethingthat can screw you up. When the public calls you a star, you had better knowthat it's only a game. If you believe and enjoy all those flatteries (yes, weare only human and we all do, to a certain extent), and forget the fact that thesame people who once were your \"pals\" might just desert you to make friends withanother \"winner\" the moment you no longer are, well, it's your choice. You ownyour right (though it needs some self-inquiry here, it is still your choice; youhave that right). Stars rise and fall. -Stars rise and then fall. This is not surprising. Many ofthem do not understand themselves, so after their failure, they will feeldisheartened. They should ask themselves if they had any substantial reason tosupport their success, or if they succeeded through luck. If they are willing tocalm down and reexamine themselves, they will feel better. But it's been myexperince that not many stars are like this. When they succeed, they are blind,thinking that they are the greatest star in the world. So, in the end, when thegod of luck leaves them, they feel unfortunate. The abuse of stardom. - There are too many stars and too few actors. Box-officepopularity often provides the stars with considerable power. Unfortunately, manytend to misuse it. Don‘t be blinded by success. - When you become successful, when you becomefamous, it's very, very easy to be blinded by all these happenings. Everybodycomes up to you when you have long hair [and] they'll say \"Hey, that's in, baby,that’s the in thing.\" But if you have no name, they'll say \"Boy, look at thatdisgusting juvenile delinquent.\""},{"pageContent":"Flattery The two diseases [of the ego]. - The two diseases are riding an ass to searchfor an ass, and riding an ass and being unwilling to dismount. The six diseases [of excessive self-consciousness]. - The six diseases are:> · The desire for victory > > · The desire to resort to technical cunning> > · The desire to display all that he has learned> > · The desire to overawe the enemy> > · The desire to play a passive role> > · The desire to get rid of whatever disease he is likely to be infected with Beware the “yes” people. - I mean, too many people are “ yes, yes, yes” to youall the time, you see. So, unless you really at that time understand what lifeis about and that, right now, man, some game is happening and realise that it isa game - fine and dandy. Then that's all right. But most people tend to beblinded by it because if things are repeated too many times, you start tobelieve it. The insincerity of those asking for advice. - Nothing is less sincere than ourmode of giving and asking advice. He who asks seems to have deference for theopinion of his friend, while he only aims to get approval of his own[opinion] and make his friend responsible for his action. And he who givesrepays the confidence supposedly placed in him by a seemingly disinterestedzeal, but he seldom means anything by his advice but his own interest orreputation. When a man seeks your advice he generally wants your praise."},{"pageContent":"PART5 [../Images/PART5.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Art Art is the expression of the self - Art is really the expression of the self.The more complicated and restricted the method, the less the opportunity for theexpression of one's original sense of freedom. Art and choiceless awareness. - Artists in all fields must learn to observechoicelessly, to digest their observations, and to express them in their work. Art begins with feelings. - Art must originate with an experience or feeling ofthe artist. Art and emotion. - Art is communication of feelings. Forget your mind and become one with the work. - If [one] has any idea at all ofdisplaying his art well, he ceases to be a good artist, for his mind \"stops\"with every movement he goes through. In all things, it is important to forgetyour \"mind\" and become one with the work at hand. Art requires creativity and freedom. - Art lives where absolute freedom is,because where it is not, there can be no creativity-art has no ego rigidity. Art is not decorative. - Art is never decoration, embellishment; instead it iswork of enlightenment. Art, in other words, is a technique for acquiringliberty. The aim of art. - The aim of art is to project an inner vision into the worldwithout. The artistic requisite. - Requirement to be an artist: purity of heart. Art is transcendent. - Art is an expression of life and transcends both time andspace. Art is the music of the soul made visible. - Behind every motion is the music ofhis soul made visible. Otherwise empty motion is like an empty word; no meaning.Postures without proper channeling of your emotions behind them are deadmovements. Art demands whole-hearted action. -Art demands only immediated, honest andwhole-hearted action. Through art our own souls are what we must employ to givea new form and a new meaning to Nature or the world. Art is psychic understanding. - Art reveals itself in psychic understanding ofthe inner essence of things, and gives form to the relation of man with NOTHING,with the nature of the absolute. Creation in art is the psychic unfolding of thepersonality, which is rooted in the Nothing. Its effect is a deepening of thepersonal dimension of the soul. Art is developed by soulful reflection. -Art calls for complete mastery oftechniques, developed by reflection within the soul. Artless art is the art of the soul. - \"Artless art\" is the artistic processwithin the artist and its meaning is \"Art of the Soul.\" All the various moves ofall the tools mean a step on the way to the absolute aesthetic world of thesoul. Artistic skill must radiate from the human soul. -Artistic skill, therefore,does not mean artistic perfection. It remains rather a continuing medium orreflection of some step in psychic development, the perfection of which is notto be found in shape and form, but must radiate from the human soul. Theartistic activity does not consist in art itself as such; it penetrates into adeeper world in which all art forms of things inwardly experienced flowtogether, and in which the harmony of soul and cosmos in the nothing has itsoutcome in reality. The task of art. -The task of art is so to state in aesthetic creation thedeepest psychic and personal experiences of a human being [so] as to enablethose experiences to be intelligible and generally recognised within the totalframework of an ideal world. Art reflects the soul. - It is the art of the soul at peace -like moonlightmirrored in a deep lake. An artist must be an artist of life. -The ultimate aim is to use his dailyactivity to become a past master of life, and so as to lay hold of the art ofliving. Masters in all branches of art must first be masters in living, for thesoul creates everything. Art leads to the essence of life. - Art is the way to the Absolute and to theessence of human life - creative action, with sensitivity, that positive stateof innocence. Art is the perfection of nature. -Art is the perfection of nature and lifethrough the artist, who has supreme control of technique and is therebyliberated from it. Art opens all human capacities. - The aim of art is not the one-sided promotionof spirit, soul, and the senses, but the OPENING of all human capacities -thought, feeling, and will - to the life rhythm of the world of nature: so willthe voiceless voice be heard and the self be brought into harmony with it. Immediacy in art. -Would that we could at once paint with the eyes! In the longway from the eye through the arm to the pencil, how much is lost! If we cling to any artistic technique it can limit our artistic expression. -Artis the expression of the self; the more compli-cared and restrictive a methodis, the lesser the opportunity for expression of one's original sense offreedom. The techniques, although they play an important role in the earlierstage, should not be too complex, restrictive, or mechanical. If we cling tothem, we will become bound by their limitations. Seamless art is perfect art. -The perfection of art is to conceal art. Pseudo-art is the result of insincerity. - Much pseudo-art comes frominsincerity or the attempt to create a work of art which does not grow from anactual experience or feeling. The four postulates of effective art. - Adequate form [in art] requires: > · Individuality rather than imitative repetitiousness> > · Brevity rather than bulkiness > > · Clarity rather than obscurity > > · Simplicity of expression rather than complexity of form. Art requires soulful commitment. - There are simply notenough soulful characters who are committed, dedicated, and at the same timeprofessional. True art cannot be handed out. - I insist and maintain that art - true art thatis - cannot be handed out. Furthermore, art is never decoration orembellishment. Instead it is a constant process of maturing (in the sense ofNOT having arrived!). Art is a means of acquiring personal liberty. - Art, after all, is a means ofacquiring \"personal\" liberty. Your way is not my way nor mine yours. The way of the artist. - With all the training thrown to nowhere, with a mind(if there is such a verbal substance) perfectly unaware of its own working, withthe \"self\" vanishing nowhere, art attains its perfection. The true artist has no public. - The true artist has no public; he works for thesheer joy of it, with an element of playfulness, of casualness. Art reaches itsgreatest peak when devoid of self-consciousness. Freedom discovers man themoment he loses concern over what impression he is making or about to make. The last step of art is simplicity. - Simplicity is the last step of art and thebeginning of nature. Where art abides. - Art lives where ABSOLUTE FREEDOM is, because where it isnot, there can be no creativity. On the point of art. - The point is to utilise the art as a means to advance inthe study of the Way. In search of a dedicated artist. - As in the combative arts, to train adeliverer and make him ready, mentally and physically, is difficult enough, andto find one with just that right appropriateness and that rare quality of adedicated artist, can happen once in a blue moon."},{"pageContent":"Film-making Longing to make a really good film. - What I long for is to make a really goodmovie. But, unfortunately, few local producers can live up to my expectations.In fact, I would be quite happy to sit down for a long talk with any one whotakes filming seriously. I would be quite satisfied even if it's just talks. Film-making is a marriage of business and art. - It is an unfortunate fact butstill a cold fact that cinema is a marriage of business and art, in Hollywood orHong Kong. Don‘t glorify violence. - I don't think one should use violence and aggressionas themes of movies. The glorification of violence is bad. Starting new trends. - What I am trying to do is start a whole trend of martialart films in the U.S. To me, they are much more interesting and exciting thanthe gun-slinging sagas of the West. In the westerns you are dealing solely withguns. Here we deal with everything. It is an expression of the human body. The creative benefit of directing. - I want to direct more films. Directing, Ifeel, is more creative. You really get a chance to produce the result you want."},{"pageContent":"Acting The quality actor. - Just what then is an actor of quality? To begin with, he isno “movie star” which is nothing but an abstract word given by the people and asymbol. There are more people who want to become \"movie stars\" than actors. Tome, an actor is the sum total of all that he is - his high level ofunderstanding of life, his appropriate good taste, his experience of happinessand adversities, his intensity, his educational background, and much, much more-like I said, the sum total of all that he is. An actor is a competent deliverer. - An actor, a good actor, not the clichetype, is in reality a \"competent deliverer,\" one who is not just ready butartistically harmonises this invisible duality of business and art into asuccessful appropriate unity. Mediocre actors or cliche actors, are plentifulbut to settle down to train a \"competent\" actor mentally and physically isdefinitely not an easy task. Just as no two human beings are alike, so too withactors. The creative restrictions of acting. -An actor is restricted. He can only do asthe director instructs. In my case I can influence the production to a certainextent because of my present status. But it is not a satisfactory state ofaffairs because I know I am interfering and I hate to interfere with otherpeople's work. An actor is foremost a human being. -As far as I am concerned - and this is onlymy personal opinion – an actor is, first of all, like you and me, strictly ahuman being, and not a glamorous symbol known as a \"star,\" which, after all, isan abstract word, a title given to you by people. An actor is a dedicated being. -My more than twenty years experience as an actorhave caused me to look at it thusly: an actor is a dedicated being who worksvery hard - so damn hard - that his level of understanding makes him a qualifiedartist in self-expression, physically, psychologically, as well as spiritually,to captivate. Acting is honest self-expression. - One more ingredient is that an actor has tobe real in expressing himself as he would honestly in a given situation. Anactor's problem though is not to be egotistical and [to] keep his cool and tolearn more through discoveries and much deep soul-searching. Dedication,absolute dedication is what keeps one ahead. Creation - not imitation. A really trained, good actor is a rarity nowadays-thatdemands the actor to be real, to be himself. The audiences are not dumb today;an actor is not simply demonstrating what one wants others to believe he isexpressing. That is mere imitation or illustration but it is not creating, eventhough this superficial demonstration can be ''performed\" with remarkableexpertise. An actor is the sum of all that he is. - Just what is an actor? Is he not thesum total of all that he is - his level of understanding, his capability tocaptivate the audience because he is real in the expression of his personalfeelings toward what was required by the scene. You can spot such artists fromordinary ones like that. The American has a word for it, it's called “charisma.”What you see on the screen is the sum total of his level of understanding, histaste, his educational background, his intensity. On personal frustration in acting. - I would like to evolve into differentroles, but I cannot do so in Southeast Asia. I am already typecast. I amsupposed to be the good guy. I can't even be a bit gray, because no producerwould let me. Besides, I can't even express myself fully on film here, or theaudience wouldn't understand what I am talking about half the time. The art of acting. - I regard acting as an art, much like my practice in martialart, because it is an expression of the self. Acting, like any profession,demands your whole-hearted devotion, no \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" or \"buts\" about it. Business and talent. - Depending on one's level of understanding, the movieindustry nowadays is basically a coexistence of practical business sense andcreative talent, each being the cause and the effect of the other. To theadministrators up in their administrative offices, an actor is a commodity, aproduct, a matter of money, money, money. \"Whether or not it sells\" is theirchief concern. The important thing is the box-office appeal. In a way they arewrong, yet in a way they are right. I will go into that later. Though cinema isin fact a marriage of practical business and creative talent, but to regard anactor - a human being - as a product, is somewhat emotionally aggravating to me."},{"pageContent":"PART6 [../Images/PART6.jpg]"},{"pageContent":" Conditioning The individual and the “what should be.” - Why do you as an individual depend onthousands of years of propaganda?

Wipe away and dissolve all its experience and be \"bornafresh.\" Keep your mind uncontaminated by past conditioning. - The more and more you'reaware, the more and more you shed from day to day what you have learned so thatyour mind is always fresh, uncontaminated by previous conditioning. Remove all psychic obstruction. -In order to display its native activities tothe utmost limit, remove all psychic obstruction. Drop your inner resistance. - Are you a flowing entity, capable to flow withexternal circumstances, or are you resisting with your set choice pattern? The truth is outside of all set patterns. - Conditioning is to limit a personwithin the framework of a particular system. All fixed set patterns areincapable of adaptability or pliability. The truth is outside of all fixedpatterns. Empty your mind and expand your life. -When there is a particle of dust in youreye, the world becomes a narrow path-have your mind completely free from objects- and how much this life expands. Live every second refreshed.- We live in cliches, in patterned behavior. We areplaying the same role over and over again. To raise our potential is TO LIVE ANDREVIEW EVERY SECOND REFRESHED.

However,if his achievement is not carried on by disciples of the same ingenuity, thenthings will only become formalised and get stuck in a cul-de-sac; wherebybreak-through and progress will be almost impossible. The formless form. - When insubstantiality and substantiality are not set anddefined, when there is no track of changing of such, one has mastered theformless form. When there is a clinging to form, when there is attachment of themind, it is not the true path. When technique comes out of itself, it is the Waygrowing out of no way. It is not simply denial. - Do not deny the classical approach as a reaction, foryou will have created another pattern in which you will be trapped. In memory of a once-fluid man. - A tombstone in memory of a man of fluidity -crammed and distorted by organised despair. Unenlightened followers can turn truth into a tomb. - The founder [of a style ormethod] might have been exposed to some partial truth, but as time passed by,especially after the passing away of its founder, this partial truth be-came alaw or, worse still, a prejudiced faith against the \"different\" sects. In orderto pass along this knowledge from generation to generation, the variousresponses had to be organised and classified, and presented in a logical order.So what might have started off as some sort of personal [insight] of its founderis now solidified knowledge, a preserved cure-all for mass conditioning. In sodoing, the followers have made this knowledge not only a holy shrine, but a tombin which the founder's wisdom is buried. Because of the nature of organisationand preservation, the means would become so elaborated that tremendous attentionmust be given to them, and gradually the end is forgotten. The followers willthen accept this \"organised something\" as the total reality. Of course, manymore \"different\" approaches would spring up, probably as a direct reaction to\"the other's truth.\" Pretty soon these approaches too would become largeorganisations with each claiming to possess \"truth\" to the exclusion of allothers. The problems of belief - Belief binds, belief isolates. An established setstyle. Chained down. In bondage. Bound. It can never comprehend the new, thefresh, the uncreated. The means destroys the freshness, the newness, thespontaneous discovery. Methods block real feelings. - When real feeling occurs, like anger, fear, etc.,can one \"express\" himself with the classical method, or is he merely listeningto his own screams and yells and mechanically performing his routine? Slaves to pattern. - Because one does not want to be disturbed, to be madeuncertain, he establishes a pattern of conduct, of thought, a pattern ofrelationship to man, etc. Then he becomes a slave to the pattern and takes thepattern to be the real thing. Methods place obstacles in the way of knowledge.- By an error repeatedthroughout the ages, truth, becoming a law or a faith, places obstacles in theway of knowledge. Method, which is in its very substance ignorance, encloses itwithin a vicious circle. We should break such circles not by seeking knowledge,but by discovering the cause of ignorance. Doctrines prevent us from really seeing. - Organical seeing diminishes andevidently [is] forgotten when we begin to choose sides and set up doctrine. Apath and a gateway have no meaning or use once the objective is in sight. The nature of tradition. - Tradition equals the habit-forming mechanism of themind. Tradition enslaves the mind. - Classical methods and tradition make the mind aslave - you are no longer an individual, but merely a product. Your mind is theresult of a thousand yesterdays. The individual is more important than the system. - The individual is of firstimportance, not the system. Remember that man created method and not that methodcreated man, and do not strain yourself in twisting into someone's preconceivedpattern, which unquestionably would be appropriate for him, but not necessarilyfor you. Truth is outside of all fixed patterns. - All fixed set patterns are incapableof adaptability or pliability. The truth is outside of all fixed patterns. Freedom of expression occurs when one is beyond system. -True observation beginswhen one is devoid of set patterns; freedom of expression occurs when one isbeyond system. A style is a classified response to one's chosen inclination. On using no way as Way. - Man is constantly growing, and when he is bound by aset pattern of ideas, or \"Way'' of doing things, that's when he stops growing. The limitation of having a set way of doing things. - Use no way as way. Whenthere is a 'Way,' therein lies the limitation. And when there is acircumference, it traps. And if it traps, it rots. And if it rots, it islifeless. Do not restrict yourself to one approach. - There are different approaches, youknow? But each person must not be limited to one approach. We must approach itwith our own self-we are always in a learning process, whereas a \"style\" [orsystem] is a concluded, established, solidified something. You cannot do that,because you learn every day as you grow older. A choice method imprisons the mind. - A choice method, however exacting, fixesthe mind in a pattern. A choice method is the cultivation of resistance, andwhere there is resistance there is no understanding. A well-disciplined mind isnot a free mind. Any technique, however worthy and desirable, becomes a diseasewhen the mind is obsessed with it. The creating individual is more important than any system. - Man, the livingcreature, the creating individual, is always more important than any establishedstyle or system. Styles conclude, humans continue.- We are always in a learning process, whereasa \"style\" is a concluded, established, solidified something. You cannot do that,because you Learn every day as you grow older. The classical man is a slave to the tradition. - The classical man is just abundle of routines, ideas, and expressed tradition. When he acts, he istranslating every living moment in terms of the old. Organised institutes produce prisoners of concepts. - I no longer am interestedin systems or organisation. Organised institutes tend to produce patternisedprisoners of a systematised concept, and the instructors are often fixed in aroutine. Of course what is worse is that by imposing the members to fit alifeless preformation, their natural growth is blocked."},{"pageContent":"Detachment Float in emptiness without obstruction. - The knowledge and kill you haveachieved are after all meant to be \"forgotten\" so you can float in emptinesswithout obstruction and comfortably.

Emptiness cannot be confined.- You cannot hurt that which is formless. Thesoftest thing cannot be snapped and emptiness cannot be confined. To be detached is to be free of positive and negative. - \"To desire\" is anattachment. \"To desire not to desire\" is also an attachment. To be unattachedthen means to be free at once from both statements, positive and negative. Inother words, this is to be simultaneously both \"yes\" and \"no,\" which isintellectually absurd. The art of detachment. - Give up thinking as though not giving it up. Observethe techniques as though not observtng.

This holding onto prevents growth."},{"pageContent":"No-mindedness (Wu-hsin) No-mindedness is nonfixation. - Wu-hsin or \"no-mindedness\" is not a blank mindwhich excludes all emotions; nor is it simply callousness and quietness of mind.Although quietude and calmness are necessary, it is the ''non-graspiness\" of themind that mainly constitutes the principle of ''no-mindedness.\" The localisationof the mind means its freezing. When it ceases to flow freely as it is needed,it is no more the mind in its suchness. A mind that is not fixated is a fluid mind. - Nonfixation - a mind that has nodwelling; it doesn't stop, but continues to flow ceaselessly and ignores ourlimitations and our distinctions. Do not strive to localise the mind anywherebut to let it fill up the whole body; let it flow freely throughout the totalityof your being. As Alan Watts puts it, the \"no-mindedness\" is a \"state ofwholeness in which the mind functions freely and easily, without the sensationof a second mind or ego standing over it with a club.\" What he means is to letthe mind think what it likes without interference by the separate thinker or egowithin oneself. Wu-hsin is the natural process of thought. - So long as the mind thinks what itwants, there is absolutely no effort in letting it go, and the disappearance ofthe effort to let go is precisely the disappearance of the separatethinker. There is nothing to try to do, for whatever comes up moment by momentis accepted, including nonacceptance. Wu-hsin is fulfillment. - \"Non-seeing\" and \"no-mind\" are not renunciations butfulfillment. The seeing that is without subject or object is \"pure seeing.\" No-mindedness is unobstructed feeling.- \"No-mindedness\" is not being withoutemotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling is not sticky or blocked. Itis a mind immune to emotional influences; \"like this river, everything is,flowing on ceaselessly without cessation or standing still.\" No-mindedness is toemploy the whole mind as we use the eyes when we rest them upon various objectsbut make no special effort to take anything in. The parable of Kwan-yin. - Kwan-yin (Avalokitesvara), the Goddess of Mercy, issometimes represented with one thousand arms, each holding a differentinstrument. If her mind stops with the use, for instance, of a spear, all theother arms (999) will be of no use whatever. It is only because of her mind notstopping with the use of one arm, but moving from one instrument to another,that all her arms prove useful with the utmost degree of efficiency. Thus thefigure is meant to demonstrate that, when the ultimate truth is realised, evenas many as one thousand arms on one body may each be serviceable in one way oranother. Wu-hsin is making oneself empty. - I must give up my desire to force, direct,strangle the world outside of me and within me in order to be completely open,responsible, aware, alive. This is often called \"to make oneself empty'' - whichdoes not mean something negative, but means the openness to receive. Wu-hsin is the fluidity of ”everyday mind.''- This \"non-stopping\" mind is knownas fluidity, which is also known as the \"empty mind\" or \"everday mind.\" To havesomething in mind means that it is preoccupied and has no time for anythingelse. But to attempt to remove the thought already in it is to refill it withanother something. So what to do! Do nothing! Don't solve it, dissolve it - notfuss, no fuss-it's the everyday mind, nothing special at all."},{"pageContent":"Zen Buddhism Zen has no metaphysics. -Zen wishes to escape the pointless endeavor to traplife in a metaphysical net instead of simply living it. Zen reveals that there is no problem-and no solution. - Zen reveals that thereis no where for man to go out of this world; no tavern in which he can overcomeanxiety; no jail in which he can expiate guilt. So, instead of telling us whatthe problem is, Zen insists that the whole trouble is just our failure torealise that there is no problem. And, of course, this means that there is nosolution, either. The parable of a tea serving. -A learned man once went to a Zen master toinquire about Zen. As the Zen master talked, the learned man would frequentlyinterrupt him with remarks like, \"Oh yes, we have too,\" etc. Finally the Zenmaster stopped talking and began to serve tea to the learned man; however, hekept on pouring until the tea cup overflowed. \"Enough, no more can go into thecup!\" the learned man interrupted. \"Indeed I see,\" answered the Zen master. \"Butif you do not first empty your cup, then how can you taste my cup of tea?\" Buddhism is effortless. -In Buddhism there is no place for using effort. Just beordinary and nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels, pass water, andwhen you're tired go and lie down. The ignorant will laugh at me, but the wisewill understand. On Buddhism’s Eight-Fold Path. - The eight requirements that will eliminatesuffering by correcting false values and giving true knowledge of life’s meaninghave been summed up as follows:> · First, you must see clearly what is wrong. > > · Next, decide to be cured. > > · You must act. > > · Speak so as to aim at being cured. > > · Your livelihood must not conflict with your therapy. > > · The therapy must go forward at the \"staying speed;\" the critical velocity> that can be sustained. > > · You must think and feel about it incessantly. > > · Learn how to contemplate with the deep mind.

Zen has no idols. - Zen liberates the mind from servitude to imagined spiritualstates as “objects,\" which too easily become hypostatised and turn into idolsthat obsess and delude the seeker. Transcending karma. - The way to transcend Karma lies in the proper use of themind and the will. The Zen of assertion. - An assertion is Zen only when it is itself an act anddoes not refer to anything that is asserred in it. On prajna (wisdom).- Prajna is not self-realisation, but realisation pure andsimple, beyond subject and object. On the bodhisattva. - Leaving sagehood behind and entering once more intoordinary humanity. After coming to understand the other side, you come back andlive on this side."},{"pageContent":"Meditation Meditation is not introversion. - It is not a technique of introversion by whichone seeks to exclude matter and the external world, to eliminate distractingthoughts, to sit in silence emptying the mind of images, and to concentrate onthe purity of one's own spiritual essence. Zen is not a mysticism of\"introversion\" and \"withdrawal.\" It is not \"acquired contemplation.\" To thinkthat this insight is a subjective experience \"attainable\" by some kind ofprocess of mental purification is to doom oneself to error and absurdity-\"mirror-wiping Zen.\" Stop inwardly. - At this moment stop inwardly - when you do stop inwardly,psychologically, your mind becomes very peaceful, very clear. Then you canreally look at \"this.\" Meditation is enlightenment. - Do not separate meditation as a means (dhyana)from enlightenment as an end (Pra-jana)- the two were really inseparable, andthe Zen discipline consisted in seeking to realise this wholeness and unity ofprajna and dhyana in all one's acts. Enlightenment is knowledge. - There is no difference between such enlightenmentand what is ordinarily termed knowledge, for in the latter a contrast existsbetween the knower and the known, whereas in the former there can be no suchcontrast. Meditation leads to thought that is not of the physical. - After the completionof cultivation (of no cultivation), one's thoughts continue to be detached fromphenomenal things, and one still remains amid the phenomenal yet devoid of thephenomenal. Real meditation puts you in the Now. - Zen is not \"attained\" by mirror-wipingmeditation, but by \"self-forgetfulness in the existential 'present' of life hereand now.\" We do not \"come,\" we \"are.\" Don't strive to become, but be. Meditation is without motive. - A simple mind, surely, is one that functions,that thinks and feels without a motive. Where there is a motive, there must be away, a method, a system of discipline. The motive is brought about by the desirefor an end, for a goal, and to achieve that goal there must be a way, etc.Meditation is a freeing of the mind from all motives. Meditation is without mental effort. - Any effort the mind makes will furtherlimit the mind, because effort implies the struggle towards a goal, and when youhave a goal, a purpose, an end in view, you have placed a limit on the mind, andit is with such a mind that you are trying to meditate. Meditation is not concentration. - Meditation, surely, can never be a process ofconcentration, because the highest form of thinking is negative thinking.Negation is not the opposite of positive, but a state in which there is neitherthe positive nor its reaction as the negative. It is a state of completeemptiness. Meditation means to be internally unperturbed. - To meditate means to realisethe imperturbability of one's original nature. Meditation means to be free fromall phenomena, and calmness means to be internally unperturbed.

The immovable. - The immovable - it is the concentration of energy at a givenfocus - as at the axis of a wheel-in-read of dispersal in scattered activities. Stillness in motion.- I'm moving and not moving at all.

Freedom cannot be preconceived. - Freedom is something that cannot bepreconcieved. To realise freedom requires an alert mind, a mind that is deepwith energy, a mind that is capable of immediate perception without the processof graduation, without the idea of an end to be slowly achieved. Preformationssimply lack the flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing. At this point, manywould ask \"how then do we gain this unlimited freedom?\" I cannot tell youbecause it will then become an approach. Although I can tell you what is not, Icannot tell you what is. \"That,\" my friend, you will have to find out all byyourself, for there is no help but self-help. On “gaining” freedom. -Who says we have to \"gain\" freedom? Freedom has alwaysbeen with us and [is] not something to be gained at the end through followingsome particular formulas. We do not \"become,\" we simply \"are.\" On being free. - Free equals the absence of feeling of external constraint. Notfree equals the absence of presence of the feeling of external constraint.Different people feel free in different ways. Therefore, it is in degree. Thequestion should then be \"how free are we?\" On freeing oneself - To free yourself, observe closely what you normallypractice. Do not condemn or approve, merely observe. To express in freedom. - To express yourself in freedom, you must die toeverything of yesterday. If you follow the classical pattern, you're notunderstanding the routines, the traditions; you are not understanding yourself.Things that limit freedom. - There is no freedom if you are enclosed by: > · Self-interest> > · Walls of discipline The relationship of freedom to sensitivity. - Great freedom = great sensitivity. Understand this freedom: The freedom from the conformity of styles. Personal expression must be free. -Expression must be free. This liberatingtruth becomes reality only in proportion to its being experienced and lived inits suchness by the individual himself. The three keys. -Simplicity. Directness. Freedom. Freedom knows no past. -To express yourself in freedom, you must die toeverything of yesterday. Beyond right and wrong. - There is no such thing as doing right or wrong whenthere is freedom.

He is a mechanicalrobot, a product of thousands of years of propaganda and conditioning. Thesecond-hand artist seldom learns to depend upon himself for expression; instead,he faithfully follows an imposed pattern. So what is nurtured is the dependentmind rather than independent inquiry. The “Mirror Person.” - A mirror-person is one who always wants to know how helooks to others. Instead of being critical, he projects the criticism and feelscriticised and feels onstage. The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone. -We [tend to]have more faith in what we imitate than in what we originate. We [often feelthat we] cannot derive a sense of absolute certitude from anything which has itsroot in us. The most poignant sense of insecurity comes from standing alone; weare not alone when we imitate . Do not look for a successful personality to duplicate. - When I look around, Ialways learn something and that is to be always yourself And to expressyourself. To have faith in yourself. Do not go out and look for a successfulpersonality and duplicate it, which seems to me to be the prevalent thinghappening in Hong Kong. Like they always copy mannerisms, but they'll neverstart from the very root of his being, which is “how can I be me?'' The need to be real. - In life, what more can you ask for but to be real? Tofulfill one's potential instead of wasting energy on actualising one'sdissipating image, which is not real, and the expenditure of one's vital energy.We have great work ahead of us, and it needs devotion and much, much energy. Perform your own mission in life. -If you look within yourself and are sure thatyou have done right, what do you have to fear or worry about? You are requiredonly to perform your own mission in life without any thoughts of aggressivenessor competition. Most of us see ourselves as instruments in the hands of others. - There is apowerful craving in most of us to see ourselves as instruments in hands ofothers and thus free ourselves from the responsibility for acts which areprompted by our own questionable inclinations and impulses. Both the strong andthe weak grasp at this alibi. The latter hide their malevolence under the virtueof obedience: they acted dishonorably because they had to obey orders. Thestrong, too, claim absolution by proclaiming themselves the chosen instrument ofa higher power - God, history, fate, nation, or humanity. Self-actualisation is the highest state. - This achieving the center, beinggrounded in one's self, is about the highest state a human being can achieve. Strive to be better. - One must always strive to be better. The sky's the limit. To find the Way. - To be on the alert means to be deadly serious, to be deadlyserious means to be sincere to oneself, and it is sincerity that finally leadsone to discover the Way. On the light within. -No matter what, you must let your inner light guide youout of the darkness. Ignorance is blind.- Those who are unaware they are walking in darkness willnever seek the light. The process of self-cultivation. -Wishing to cultivate oneself, one firstrectifies his heart (mind). Wishing to rectify his heart, one seeks to besincere in his thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in his thoughts, one firstextends to the utmost of his knowledge - such extension of knowledge lies in theinvestigation of things. The statement of the self-actualised. - I am what I am here and now. Self-actualisation vs. self-image actualisation. - Yes, there is a differencebetween self-actualisation and self-image actualisation. Most people only livefor their image, that is why where some have a self, a starting point, mostpeople have a void, because they are so busy projecting themselves as this orthat, dedicating their lives to actualise a concept of what they should be likerather than to actualise their ever-growing potentiality as a humanbeing. Wasting, dissipating all their energy in projection and conjuring up offacade, rather than centering their energy on expanding and broadening theirpotential or expressing and relaying this unified energy for efficientcommunication, etc. Maintaining a facade is futile. - The futility of maintaining a facade to act inone way on the surface when actually experiencing something quite different.Being one's self leads to real relationships, and the acceptance of self leadsto change. A self-actualising person is a real person. - When a [self-actualising] humanbeing sees another self-actualising person walk past, he cannot help but say“hey, now there is someone real!'' How one becomes what one is. - Self-actualisation is the important thing. And mypersonal message to people is that I hope they will go towardsself-actualisation rather than self-image actualisation. I hope that they willsearch within themselves for honest self-expression. Absorb what is useful. - Research your own experience; absorb what is useful,reject what is useless and add what is essentially your own. True individualism is self-sufficiency. - Evaluation by others is not a guidefor me. Only the self-sufficient stand alone - most people follow the crowd andimitate. The self-actualised seek freedom and purity. -Those who distrust the life-givingforce within them, or who have none, are driven to compensate through suchsubstitutes as money. When a man has confidence in himself, when all he wants inthe world is to live out his destiny in freedom and purity, he comes to regardall those vastly overestimated and far too costly possessions as mereaccessories, pleasant perhaps to have and make use of, but never essential. To actualise one must listen. - Stop wasting time in playing a role or aconcept. Instead, learn to ACTUALISE yourself, your potential. The main thing isto listen. To listen, to understand, to be open, is one and the same. The path of self-realisation is the most difficult. -We acquire a sense of wortheither by realising our talents, or by keeping busy, or by identifying ourselveswith something apart from us - be it a cause, a leader, a group, possessions,and the like. Of the three, the path of self-realisation is the most difficult.It is taken when other avenues to a sense of worth are more or less blocked. Self-realisation is enlightenment. – Satori, in the awakening from a dream.Awakening and self-realisation and seeing into one's own being-these aresynonymous. The sacred journey is taken alone. - Each man must seek out realisation himselfNo master can give it to him. The image creates dependency. - If you disown yourself to play an image [conceptof yourself], you will become the target, you will become dependent. Playing the concept wastes valuable energy. - Playing the concept strengthensour negativeness, prevents us from seeing, and, above all, wastes a lot energy,instead of using this energy creatively for our own development. Be alert, question and find out. -The important thing for you is to be alert, toquestion, to find out, so that your own initiative may be awakened."},{"pageContent":"Self-help There is only self-help. - I have come to discover through earnest personalexperience and dedicated learning that ultimately the greatest help isself-help; that there is no other help but self-help - doing one's best,dedicating one's self whole-heartedly to a given task, which happens to have noend but is an ongoing process. Admitting mistakes. -Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage toadmit them. There is no external help. - The problem lies in asking somebody else to solveyour own problem instead of asking yourself. I can give you ten thousand of myways, but they are my way, not yours. An individual's questions are answerableonly by the individual himself, and nothing would be gained by his sitting in ona recital of mine (pause). The medicine for suffering is within. - The medicine for my suffering I hadwithin me from the very beginning, but I did not take it. My ailment came fromwithin myself, but I did not observe it-until this moment. Now I see that I willnever find the light unless, like the candle, I am my own fuel, consumingmyself. Self-help comes in many forms. - Self-help comes in many forms: dailydiscoveries through choiceless observation, honesty, as we alwayswhole-heartedly do our best, a sort of indomitable, obsessive dedication, andabove all, to realise that there is no end or limit to this, because life issimply an ever-going process. The key to liberation is within. - Each man binds himself; the fetters areignorance, laziness, preoccupation with self, and fear. He must liberatehimself, while accepting the fact that we are of this world, so that \"In summerwe sweat; in winter we shiver.\" Self-reliance. - Self-reliance - find your own need, your own qualification. To conquer oneself - A man is born to achieve great things if he has thestrength to conquer himself. To see oneself is to be clear of right. Unfinished situations. -We carry much of the past with us only as far as we haveUNFINISHED SITUATIONS. The greatest victory is over oneself - Self-conquest is the greatest ofvictories. Mighty is he who conquers himself. Learn your nature in order to control it. - In order to control myself I mustfirst accept myself by going with and not against my nature. Everybody has tothink for himself. A right way for a big man may not be a right way for a smallman. A right way for someone who is slow may not be a right way for someone whois quick. Each person must understand his weaknesses and his strengths."},{"pageContent":"Self-knowledge Know thyself- It is later than you think! Know yourself!! The answer within. - Instead of establishing rigid rules and separativethoughts, we should look within ourselves to see where our particular problemslie and our cause of ignorance. You see, ultimately, all type of knowledgesimply means self-knowledge. You must look for the truth yourself and directlyexperience every minute detail for yourself. Self-knowledge involves relationship. -To know oneself is to study oneself inaction with another person. Relationship is a process of self-revelation.Relationship is the mirror in which you discover yourself-to be is to berelated. The liberating quality of self-knowledge. - When you're faced with looking atyour own life with awakened eyes, you will have increased a bit in the knowledgeof yourself (in other words, your mental and physical abilities will becomeclear to you), and knowledge of anything outside of yourself is only superficialand very shallow. To put it another way, self knowledge has a liberatingquality. Man at his worst. - A man is at his worst when he does not understand himself.When I first arrived I did \"The Green Hornet\" television series back in 1965.And, as I looked around, man, I saw a lot of human beings. And as I looked atmyself I was the only robot there. Because I was not being myself, and I wastrying to accumulate external securities. External technique; the way to move myarm, the way to move - but never to ask and learn what would Bruce Lee have doneif-the word \"if\" - such a thing had happened to me? Criticising others is easier than coming to know yourself- For it is easy tocriticise and break down the spirit of others, but to know yourself takes maybea lifetime. To take responsibility of one's actions, good and bad, is somethingelse. After all, all knowledge simply means self-knowledge. The continuous peeling of self - My life it seems is a life of self-examination:a self-peeling of my self, bit by bit, day by day. More and more it's becomingsimple to me as a human being [as] more and more I search [within] myself. Andmore and more the questions become listed. And more and more I see clearly. Itis not a question of developing what has already been developed but ofrecovering what has been left behind. Though this has been with us, in us, allthe time and has never been lost or distorted except for our misguidedmanipulation of it. The need to question. - 0h I know we all admit that we are intelligent beings;yet, I wonder how many of us have gone through some sort of self-inquiriesand/or self-examining of all these ready-made facts or truths that are crammeddown our throats ever since we acquired the capacity and the sensibility tolearn. Learning to truly see.- We possess a pair of eyes, but most of us do not reallysee in the true sense of the word. I must say that when the eyes are usedexternally to observe the inevitable faults of other beings, most of us arerather quick with readily-equipped condemnation. True seeing, in the sense ofchoiceless awareness, leads to new discovery, and discovery is one of the meansto uncovering our potentiality. Look for your resentment. - If you have any difficulties in communication withsomebody, look for your resentment. Whenever you feel guilty, find out what youare resenting and express it and make your demand explicit. Self-knowledge as the road to freedom. - Freedom lies in understanding yourselffrom moment to moment. Attend to the inner self - The pursuit of pleasures deranges the mind of man.The love for wealth perverts the conduct of man. Therefore the Sage attends tothe Inner Self, and not to the outward appearance. Self-knowledge and intelligence. - Intelligence is the understanding of self Awareness vs. robotics. -Be “self-aware\" rather than [a] repetitious robot. The transcendence. -I have changed from self-image actualisation toself-actualisation, from blindly following propaganda, organised truths, etc.,to search internally for the cause of my gnorance. Public esteem vs. self-esteem. - Esteem by others or self-esteem, which isbetter? To value things or to value yourself, which is better? To have more orto have less, which is worse? The more you have, the more you have to lose. Themore you value things, the less you value yourself The more you depend uponothers for esteem, the less you are self-sufficient. Self-knowledge is true mastery. -True mastery transcends any particular art. Itstems from mastery of oneself-the ability, developed through self-discipline tobe calm, fully aware, and completely in tune with oneself and the surroundings.Then, and only then, can a person know himself Self-knowledge is the task of the living. - While we are still alive, we have todiscover ourselves, understand ourselves, and express ourselves."},{"pageContent":"Self-expression Head toward self-expression. - Head toward self-expression andself-actualisation and not just a means of mediocre functioning or repetitiousdrilling on a chosen pattern.

Awareness of “now” and “how. “ - Anytime you use the words NOW and HOW andbecome aware of this, you grow - it's the remedy of reintegrating, taking backwhat is rightfully yours. The nature of growth. - Growth is the constant discovery and understanding inone's process of living. Learning is boundless. - I dare not say that I have reached any state ofachievement. I'm still learning, for learning is boundless. The need to progress. - Do not hold to what you have. It is like a ferry boatfor people who want to get across waters. Once you have got across, never bearit on your back. You should head forward. Discovery + understanding = growth + learning. - Daily discovery andunderstanding is the process of growth and learning. I am happy because I amgrowing daily and honestly don't know where my ultimate limit lies. To becertain, every day there can be a revelation or a new discovery that I canobtain. The need to make new discoveries every day. - I am improving and making newdiscoveries every day. If you don't you are already crystallised and that's it. Maturity vs. maturing. -There is no such word as \"maturity.\" Rather: maturing.Because when there is a maturity, there is a conclusion and a cessation. That's\"the end.\" That's when the coffin is closed. On maturing. -To mature means to take responsibility for your life and to be onyour own. Maturing is the transcendence from environmental support toself-support. Growth is constant. - Man is constantly growing. And when he is bound by a setpattern of ideas, or \"Way\" of doing things, that's when he stops growing. Age and discovery. - You might be deteriorating, physically, in the long processof aging, but in your daily discovery, it's still the very same every day. Youdo not get better as you grow older - you only get wiser. To understand is to connect. - The more we understand, the greater and deeperwill be our contact with all that is around us. The growth aim. - The growth aim is to lose more and more of your \"mind\" andcome more to your sense. To be more and more in touch with yourself and theworld, instead of only in touch with the fantasies, prejudices, etc. Frustration is a means of growth. - People have to grow by skillfulfrustrations, otherwise they have no incentive to develop their own means andways of coping with the world.

The etymology of yang. - The yang (whiteness) principle represents positiveness,firmness, masculinity, substantiality, brightness, day, heat, etc. The etymology of yin. -The yin (blackness) principle represents negativeness,softness, femininity, insubstantiality, darkness, night, coldness, and so forth. The basic theory underlying yin-yang. -The basic theory in yin-yang is thatnothing is so permanent as never to change. In other words, when activity (yang)reaches the extreme point, it becomes inactivity, and inactivity forms yin.Extreme inactivity will, in the same way, return to become activity, which isyang. Activity then is the cause of inactivity, and vice versa. This system ofcomplementary increasing and decreasing of the principle is continuous. Fromthis, one can see that the two forces (yin-yang), although they appear toconflict, in reality are mutually interdependent; instead of opposition, thereis cooperation and alternation. Yin-yang is not dualistic. - The common mistake of the Western World is toidentify these two forces, yin and yang, as dualistic; that is, yang being theopposite of yin, and vice versa. At best they see the two forces as cause andeffect, but never paired like sound and echo, or light and shadow. Yin-yang - not yin and yang. - You cannot use the word \"and\" when speaking ofyin-yang, as yin-yang is never two, but rather poles of one interconnectedprocess. Just as in pedaling a bicycle; you cannot just push or not push; unlessboth legs are working together, you cannot get anywhere. Neither can be omittedor separate from the other. Why do we have to use this kind of thinking? It'slike trying to move an elephant by pulling it - very unnatural. We must followthe natural course, just like the up and down of pedaling a bicycle. If youtried to pedal by just pushing - or by just releasing-you would get nowhere andwould never get to enjoy the beauty of the scenery outdoors. On the balance inherent in yin-yang. -In the yin-yang symbol there is a whitespot on the black part and a black spot on the white one. This is to illustratethe balance in life, for nothing can survive long going to either extreme, be itpure yin (mere passiveness) or pure yang (mere activeness). Notice the stiffesttree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survive by bending withthe wind. Extreme heat kills and so does extreme cold; no violent extremes canendure long, but a sober moderation [can]. Therefore positiveness (yang) shouldbe concealed in negativeness (yin), and vice versa. K’un (yin) is the perfect complement to ch’ien (yang). - K'un (yin, thereceptive) is the perfect complement of the ch'ien (yang, the positive) - thecomplement, not the opposite, for the receptive does not combat the positive(ch'ien) but completes it. The receptive must be activated and led by thepositive (ch'ien). Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand as anequal side by side with the positive, does it become evil. Each is the cause andresult of one another. The result then is opposition to and struggle against thepositive, which is evil. It is the positive that begets things, but they'rebrought to birth by the receptive. The receptive accommodates itself to thequalities of the positive and makes them its own. Therefore the receptive has noneed of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort; yet everything turnsout as it should. The yin opens when it moves and closes when at rest. Be softyet not yielding; firm, yet not hard. On Zen and yin-yang. -Zen has derived many of its concepts from the Chinesebelief in balance: yin, which is feminine and gentle, and yang, which ismasculine and firm. Having accepted that basic idea, another must be added:there is no such thing as pure yin or pure yang. Gentleness should cloakfirmness; firmness should be modified by gentleness. Yin-yang and the relationship of good and bad. - Good and bad or pleasure andpain exist but for the other. Instead of opposites, they are complementaries and[each] is a function each of the other. First of all, if I have not felt painhow can I distinguish pleasure, or vice versa? Looking. at the sky I candistinguish a smaller star because of the big stars, and, if there were no blacksky at all, there will be no stars. It is not a matter to struggle between thegood and the bad, but to flow like waves on the water. The way of yin-yang. - When one wishes to expand, one must first contract. Whenone wishes to be strong, one must first be weak. When one wishes to take, onemust first give. Everything in this world has the alternative of existence andnonexistence (positive and negative)Yin-yang and its relationship to Eastern and Western culture. - Nothing issuperior in every respect. The Occidental education is excellent in some ways,the Oriental in others. You will say, “This finger is better for one purpose;this finger is better for another.\" But the entire hand is better for allpurposes. There are good points in Chinese culture; there are good points inOccidental culture. Oriental culture and Occidental culture are not mutuallyexclusive, but mutually dependent. Neither would be remarkable if it were notfor the existence of the other. Yin-yang and its relationship to man and woman. - No woman should followpassively. She must learn that there is an active way of following. She musthave what the Occidentals call “backbone.\" By the same reasoning, no man shouldbe totally firm; his resolve must be softened by compassion. Yin-yang represents totality. - In reality, things are whole and cannot beseparated into two parts. When I say \"the heat makes me perspire,\" the heat andperspiring are just one process as they are coexistent, and the one could notexist but for the other. Just as an object needs a subject, a person in questionis not taking an independent position but is acting as an assistant. Things dohave their complementaries, and complementaries coexist; instead of [being]mutually exclusive,. they are mutually dependent and are a function each of theother. No part has a life of its own, but each exists in complementaryinteraction WITH the other. Yin and yang mutually help each other - duality inharmonious relationship. Yin-yang and extremes in trends. - Nothing can be secured by extremes. Forinstance, the haircuts worn by many boys at this time are not haircuts at all,but disguises. The fashion cannot last, because it is extreme and will soon tirethe wearer and the beholder. Possibly the beholder more quickly, but a vastboredom for all in any case. The so-called jet set is really boring to thatextent that they all go to extremes. Yin-yang and chatterboxes. - The more volubly one talks, the quicker will comehis exhaustion."},{"pageContent":"Totality Do not cling to partiality. -Do not cling to partiality, however fantastic - seethings from TOTALITY. Be affected by the totality of creative energy. -Move \"playfully serious\" fromthe creative tide (primordial creative energy) affected by it totally and not amere fragment. Totality and enlightenment. - To obtain enlightenment means the extinction ofeverything which obscures the \"true knowledge,\" the \"real life;\" at the sametime, it implies \"boundless expansion,\" and, indeed emphasis should fall not onthe cultivation of the \"particular department which merges into the totality,\"but rather on \"the totality that enters and unites that particular department!\" There is no effective segment of a totality. - There is no such thing as aneffective segment of a totality. How can one respond to the totality with [a]partial, fragmentary pattern? In the greater the lesser is, but in the lesserthe greater is not. The way to freedom is through totality. -Fluidity leads to interchangeability.Self-knowledge leads to awareness. Totality leads to ultimate freedom. Beyond liking and disliking. -You will then see it without like or dislike, yousimply see, and in this seeing, the whole is presented and not the partial. Do not be anchored to one view. - Having the totality means capable of followingwith what is, because what is is constantly moving and constantly changing, andif one is anchored down to one partialised view, one will not be able to followthe swift movement of what is. Totality in action. - Action is not a matter or right and wrong. It is only whenaction is partial, not total, that there is right and wrong. To be whole. -An organism works as a whole. We are not a summation of part, buta very subtle coordination of all these different bits that go into the makingof the organism - we HAVE not a liver or a heart. We ARE liver and heart andbrain and so on. On viewing totality.- To view totality one has to be a total outsider."},{"pageContent":"Tao The history of Tao. -To the Chinese what is highest, the origin of things, isnothingness, emptiness, the altogether undetermined, the abstract universal, andthis is also called Tao. Before Confucius, the term \"Tao\" usually meant a road,or a way of action. Confucius used it as a philosophical concept standing forthe right way of action - moral, social, and political. The Taoist used the term\"Tao\" to stand for the totality of all things, equivalent to what somephilosophers* have called \"The Absolute.\" The \"Tao\" was the basic stuff out ofwhich all things were made. It was simple, formless, desireless, withoutstriving, supremely content.* [i.e., Hegel] Gentleness in the Tao Te Ching. -In Tao Te Ching, the gospel of Taoism, Lao-tzupointed out to us the value of gentleness. Contrary to common belief, the yinprinciple, as softness and pliableness, is to be associated with life andsurvival. Because he can yield, a man can survive. In contrast, the yangprinciple, which is assumed to be rigorous and hard, makes a man break underpressure. On uniting with Tao - a personal experience. - I lay on the boat and felt that Ihad united with Tao; I had become one with nature. I just lay there and let theboat drift freely according to its own will. For at that moment I had achieved astate of inner feeling in which opposition had become mutually cooperativeinstead of mutually exclusive, in which there was no longer any conflict in mymind. The whole world to me was unitary. The Tao and emptiness. - The assimilation of the Tao has its foundation in“meekness,\" “tenderness,\" poverty of spirit, and quietness. These are expressedsometimes by one word, “emptiness.\" An aggressive spirit will be brought low,pride leads to a fall, violence will end in defeat, all [of] which come frommisunderstanding the real use of Tao. The philosophy of Taoism. - Taoism is a philosophy of the essential unity of theuniverse (monism), or reversion, polarisation (yin & yang), and eternal cycles,of the leveling of all differences, the relativity of all standards, and thereturn of all to the primeval one, the divine intelligence, the source of allthings. From this naturally arises the absence of desire for strife andcontention and fighting for advantage. Thus the teachings of humility andmeekness of the Christian Sermon on the Mount find a rational basis, and apeaceable temper is bred in man. It emphasises nonresistance and the importanceof gentleness. Tao is truth. - The word “Tao\" has no exact equivalent in the English language.To render it into “way,\" “Principle,\" or “Law'' is to give it a too narrowinterpretation. Although no one word can substitute [for] it's meaning, I haveused the word “Truth\" for it."},{"pageContent":"Truth To be truthful and honest. - One must be truthful and honest in his approach; aconstant independent inquiry and not blindly following a certain blue print laiddown by others. Truth is where the problem is. - We shall find the truth when we examine theproblem. The problem is never apart from the answer, the problem is the answer -the understanding of the problem is the dissolution of the problem. It is amistake to think that one can establish a universal definition for verification. Determining truth in propositions. -A proposition is true if:> · Every proposition corresponds to a fact in the world.> > · Every proposition is a kind of symbol which pictures a particular fact-e.g.,> musical scales. If a picture is true, therefore a proposition is true. > > · Indefinable view > > · Coherence view > > · Every proposition should fit into and will not contradict the set.> > · Cannot dissect experience into subject and predicate> > · Can take experience as a whole > > · Reality is coherent. Determining truth in statements. -A statement of reality is true if it doesn'tcontradict other statements concerning reality. Determining truth in beliefs. -A belief is true if and only if one can act on itwithout upsetting one's expectation. Truth in nature. -There is an element of truth in everything. Nature teaches,although it can sometimes be misleading. The man who seeks truth lives in what is. -The man who is really serious, withthe urge to find out what truth is, has not style at all. He lives only in whatis. Truth must be experienced by the individual to be meaningful. - A fat bellycannot believe that such a thing as hunger exists. It is something you have togo through and understand. No one can eat and digest your food for you in orderto give you the necessary strength to live. The realisation of truth. - Truth comes when your mind and heart are purged ofall sense of striving and you are no longer trying to become somebody; it isthere when the mind is very quiet, listening timelessly to everything. The paradigm of truth. - I have said before \"truth is nowhere to be found on amap.\" Your truth is different from that of mine. At first, you may think thatthis is truth, but later you discover another truth, and then the former truthis denied - but you are closer to truth. Perhaps when we have found out moreabout what is not the truth, we will be that much closer to the truth. Toexperience pain, for example, does not necessarily mean that one understands it,accepts it, or even for that matter, denies its existence: It is. But it doesnot follow that everyone will understand pain in the same way and arrive at thesame conclusion. All one has to do is take a close look at the medicalprofession. However, when I say that pain \"is,\" [this] does imply that I amexperiencing some THING, but to relate this THING to someone other than myselfseems to be where the difficulty lies. It is, I believe, more than a semanticdifficulty - it is an impossibility. Semantically, we all respond to a givenidea, concept, or word in much the same way: that is, if the concept, idea, orword is in our own native language. Truth cannot be limited. - Truth cannot be structured or confined. When there isno center and no circumference, then there is truth. Truth cannot be organised. - You can't organise truth. That's like trying to puta pound of water into wrapping paper and shaping it. School yourself in the truth. - Cultivate and school yourself in the TRUTH-studyhard and enjoy your planning and steps to ultimate fulfillment. Partialisedcultivation is not an approach to truth; there is no \"your style\" or \"my style,\"but only the intelligent understanding of the problem. The ways of truth. - The ways of truth consist of seeking after truth, awarenessof truth (and it's existence), perception of truth (it's substance anddirection, like the perception of movement), understanding of truth,experiencing of truth, mastering of truth, forgetting truth, forgetting thecarrier of truth, the return to the primal source where truth has its roots, andrepose in nothing. First-rate philosophers practice truth in order to understand it. - According toTao, a first-rate philosopher practices truth in order to understand it.Krishnamurti pointed out that in order to see truth, one cannot be fragmented,but must see the totality. On being truthful. - If you don't want to slip up tomorrow, speak the truthtoday. Truth is everyday life. - The truth and the Way exhibit in the simple everydaymovements. Because of this, many miss it (if there is any secret, it is missedby seeking). If there is any secret, one must have lost it by striving forit. The truth is here but men want to decorate the simple truth - the snake withfeet. Truth as liberating agent. - The direct awareness in which is formed \"truth thatmakes us free\" - not the truth as an object of knowledge, only but the truthlived and experienced in concrete and existential awareness. Anger and truth. - That man in whom the truth is bright has no anger. Truth transcends “for” and “against.”- The perfect Way is only difficult forthose who pick and choose; do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear.Make a hair's-breadth difference, and heaven and earth are set apart; if youwant the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The strugglebetween \"for\" and \"against\" is the mind's worst disease. One’s perspective on truth changes with change. - Because I am a changing aswell as an ever-growing man, thus what I hold true a couple of months ago mightnot be the same now. There is a pathless road. - Truth is a pathless road. A road that is not a road.It is total expression that has no before or after. How can there be methods andsystems by which to arrive at something that is living? To that which is static,fixed, dead, there can be a way, a definite path, but not to that which isliving. Truth is outside molds and patterns. - Truth exists outside of all molds andpatterns, and awareness is never exclusive. Truth is never a set idea anddefinitely not a conclusion. Styles and methods are conclusions but the truth oflife is a process. Find out for yourself what is true. - Create immediately an atmosphere offreedom so that you can live and find out for yourselves what is true, so thatyou are able to face the world with the ability to understand it, not justconform to it. One can tell for oneself whether the water is warm or cold. Inthe same way, a man must convince himself about these experiences, only then arethey real. Discard what is ornamental. - Shun what is trivial and discard what isornamental. The ultimate truth. - The ultimate has no symbol, no style, no superhuman. Truth is not found in a book. - Truth is not to be found in a book. Furthermore,such a book merely presents a barrier to progress in your search for truth.Independent inquiry is needed in your search for truth, not dependence on anyoneelse's view or a mere book. \"A finger pointing to the moon.\" - These few paragraphs at best are merely \"afinger pointing to the moon.\" Please do not take the finger to be the moon orfix your intense gaze on the finger and thus miss all the beautiful sight ofheaven. After all, the usefulness of the finger is in pointing away from itselfto the light that illumines finger and all. Emptiness - the end. - I have to leave now, my friend. You have a long journeyahead of you, and you must travel light. From now on drop all your burden ofpreconceived conclusions behind, and \"open\" yourself to everything and everyoneahead. Remember, my friend, the usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness. The end is the beginning. - The beginning and the end thus turn into next-doorneighbors. On the musical scale, one may start with the lowest pitch andgradually ascend to the highest. When the highest is reached one finds it islocated next to the lowest. To know, but to be as though not knowing, is theheight of wisdom."}]
