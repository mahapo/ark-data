Thecompany’s founder, Charles E. Tuttle, belonged to a New England family steepedin publishing.Immediately after WW II, Tuttle served in Tokyo under General Douglas MacArthurand was tasked with reviving the Japanese publishing industry. He later foundedthe Charles E. Tuttle Publishing Company, which thrives today as one of theworld’s leading independent publishers.Though a westerner, Tuttle was hugely instrumental in bringing a knowledge ofJapan and Asia to a world hungry for information about the East. By the time ofhis death in 1993, Tuttle had published over 6,000 books on Asian culture,history and art—a legacy honored by the Japanese emperor with the “Order of theSacred Treasure,” the highest tribute Japan can bestow upon a non-Japanese.With a backlist of 1,500 titles, Tuttle Publishing is more active today than atany time in its past—inspired by Charles Tuttle’s core mission to publish finebooks to span the East and West and provide a greater understanding of each."},{"pageContent":"DISCLAIMER: PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR(S) OF THIS INSTRUCTIONALBOOK ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER FOR ANY INJURY THAT MAY RESULTFROM PRACTICING THE TECHNIQUES AND/OR FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN WITHIN.MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING CAN BE DANGEROUS—BOTH TO YOU AND TO OTHERS—IF NOTPRACTICED SAFELY.

THIS WAS TO BE MY FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF BRUCE LEE—A STUDENT OFPHILOSOPHY WHO HAPPENED ALSO TO BE A TEACHER OF GUNG FU. WHEN THE NAME “BRUCELEE” IS MENTIONED, MOST OF THE WORLD ENVISIONS A SUPERHUMAN ACTION STAR OFMARTIAL ART MAYHEM, BUT MY QUINTESSENTIAL MEMORY OF HIM IS AS A THINKER, ANETERNAL SCHOLAR, AND AN EXPLORER IN SEARCH OF HIS SOUL. VIA THE MEDIUM OF FILM,BY SHEER FORCE OF HIS PERSONALITY, BRUCE COMMUNICATED A STRONG MESSAGE OFSTRENGTH, POWER, AND CHARISMA, BUT IN THESE HITHER-TO-PRIVATE PAPERS YOU WILL BEINTRODUCED TO BRUCE LEE, THE STUDENT OF LIFE, THE DESIGNER OF HIS DESTINY.THE PHILOSOPHY OF MARTIAL ART WAS BRUCE’S PASSION. IT WAS OUT OF THIS LOVE FORWISDOM THAT BRUCE GAVE HIMSELF THE FREEDOM TO CREATE HIS PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY FORLIVING. BUT BEFORE HE COULD BE FREE TO TAKE THAT JOURNEY, HE HAD TO PACK HIS BAGWITH THE TOOLS HE WOULD NEED ALONG THE WAY. FORMAL SCHOOLING AND GUNG FUTRAINING WERE THE FIRST TOOLS, FOLLOWED BY YEARS OF SELF-EDUCATION THROUGH BOOKSAND RESEARCH. THE ESSAYS IN THIS VOLUME WERE WRITTEN WHEN BRUCE WAS IN HIS EARLYTWENTIES—HE IS IN THE PROCESS OF ADDING THE TOOLS TO HIS BAG WHICH, AS HEEVOLVED TOWARD GREATER EMERGENCE OF SELF, WOULD BECOME PART OF HIS BEING, THUSFREEING HIM FROM TOTING THE EXTRA BAGGAGE.IN MARTIAL ART CIRCLES IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT BRUCE WAS ICONOCLASTIC IN HIS IDEASABOUT THE PRACTICE AND APPLICATION OF TRADITIONAL STYLES. INITIALLY REGARDED ASA YOUNG UPSTART SHOOTING HIS MOUTH OFF ABOUT CUSTOMS THAT WERE ROOTED INTHOUSANDS OF YEARS OF HISTORY, IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR THE MARTIAL ARTCOMMUNITY TO REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A WISE-BEYOND-HIS-YEARS YOUNG MAN WHO WOREHIS SELF-CONFIDENCE AS COMFORTABLY AS A SUIT OF CLOTHES. BRUCE’S “RADICAL” IDEASWERE NOT DELIVERED OFF THE CUFF, BUT WERE, IN FACT, THE PRODUCT OF MANY YEARS OFSTUDY AND A DEEP-ROOTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE VERY THINGS TO WHICH HE OFTEN OBJECTED.TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HIS ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY CLINGING TOCERTAIN TRADITIONAL MARTIAL ART PRACTICES, IT WAS FIRST NECESSARY FOR BRUCE TOGAIN A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROOTS OF THESE TRADITIONS. TO HIS MINDTHERE WAS NO UNCONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF STYLES, FORMS, OR RIGID THOUGHTPATTERNS, HOWEVER IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE HAD ACHIEVED A HIGH RESPECT FOR THEUNDERLYING PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL IDEAS IN MARTIAL ART THAT HE WAS ABLE TOFREE HIMSELF FROM BEING BOUND BY THE CHAINS OF UNREASONED BELIEFS. RESPECTINGSOME TRADITIONS AS BENEFICIAL, REJECTING OTHERS AS STIFLING TO PERSONALDEVELOPMENT, BRUCE WAS THEN FREE TO LIBERATE HIS OWN IDEAS, TO EXPAND HISCONSCIOUSNESS, TO ENTER FULLY INTO HIS PROCESS OF BECOMING A TRUE ARTIST OF THEMARTIAL WAY AND A REAL HUMAN BEING.THE IDEAS ON THESE PAGES ARE AMONG THE EARLIEST WRITTEN RECORDS OF BRUCE’SJOURNEY INTO THE REALM OF PHILOSOPHICAL WISDOM. IN WRITING HIS INTERPRETATION OFPRINCIPLES THAT HAVE COME DOWN THROUGH THE AGES, HE WAS ABLE TO APPLY THEM,FIRST TO HIS WAY OF GUNG FU, AND TO HIS WAY OF LIFE AS WELL. THE YIN/YANGSYMBOL, FOR INSTANCE, WHICH IS SO POPULARLY USED NOWADAYS, WITHOUTUNDERSTANDING, TO INDICATE ANYTHING OF ASIAN OR MYSTIC ORIGIN, HELD TREMENDOUSSIGNIFICANCE FOR BRUCE. HE EXPLAINS IN THESE ESSAYS HOW IT FORMS THE BASIS FORGUNG FU THEORY AND IN FACT FOR THE TAOIST INTERPRETATION OF THE UNIVERSE. IT ISONE THING TO UNDERSTAND A PRINCIPLE INTELLECTUALLY, BUT BRUCE WAS ABLE TO APPLYYIN/YANG THEORY TO COMBATIVE TECHNIQUE, AS WELL AS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN.IMMERSING HIMSELF IN THE STUDY OF ANCIENT WISDOM WAS THE ESSENTIAL STEP FORBRUCE TO ARRIVE AT THAT CRUCIAL POINT OF INTROSPECTION FROM WHERE HE WAS ABLE TODISCERN THE PRINCIPLES THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS OWN GROWTH. INSIGHT IS NOT AQUALITY THAT COMES NATURALLY, RATHER IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS NURTUREDTHROUGH INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING. IT WAS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF APPLYING HISINTELLIGENCE THAT BRUCE DEVELOPED DEEP INSIGHTS INTO LIVING THE TAO OF GUNG FU.HE MADE PASSIONATE INQUIRY INTO EVERY ASPECT OF LIVING THE MARTIAL WAY, HERESPECTED TRADITIONAL BELIEFS, BUT WAS NOT BOUND BY UNEXAMINED TRADITION, HECREATED HIS OWN PHILOSOPHICAL OUTLOOK ON LIFE, AND LIVED IT AND BREATHED ITEVERY MOMENT OF EVERY DAY—THIS WAS BRUCE’S PROCESS. IN THIS VOLUME, HE SHARESTHAT PROCESS WITH YOU.IT IS A BLESSING TO HAVE A PASSION IN LIFE. BRUCE WAS BLESSED IN THAT REGARD ASARE WE, THE BENEFICIARIES OF HIS PASSION."},{"pageContent":"PREFACEBY JOHN LITTLEIN THE YEAR 1963, TWENTY-TWO-YEAR-OLD BRUCE LEE SAT DOWN TO WRITE A LITTLENINETY-SEVEN PAGE PRIMER ON THE THEN LITTLE-KNOWN MARTIAL ART OF GUNG FU. THEBOOK WAS TITLED CHINESE GUNG FU: THE PHILOSOPHICAL ART OF SELF DEFENSE (THE ONLYBOOK THAT LEE EVER AUTHORED DURING HIS LIFETIME, BY THE WAY). EVEN THEN, LEE HADENVISIONED WRITING A BIGGER AND MORE IN-DEPTH BOOK ON HIS BELOVED ART, GOING SOFAR AS TO WRITE ON PAGE SEVEN OF THAT LITTLE BOOK:IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, AFTER MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT, A MORE THOROUGH BOOKTITLED “THE TAO OF CHINESE GUNG FU” WILL BE PUBLISHED.BY NOVEMBER OF 1964, LEE WAS STILL WORKING ON THE BOOK, MENTIONING IN A LETTERTO A FRIEND:I’M IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING A MUCH [MORE] THOROUGH BOOK ON THE TAO OF GUNGFU. . . . THIS BOOK WILL CONTAIN MY INSIGHT DURING THESE PAST FIVE YEARS. I’VEWORKED HARD FOR IT.THIS IS THAT BOOK. IT WAS TO HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN 1965 AND WAS INTENDED BY ITSAUTHOR, BRUCE LEE, TO BE HIS GIFT TO THE WESTERN WORLD.WHILE LEE SCRAPPED THE IDEA OF PUBLISHING THIS BOOK, HE DID NOT SCRAP HISRESEARCH NOTES OR SAMPLE CHAPTERS. LEE LEFT BEHIND SUBSTANTIAL CHAPTER WRITINGS,NOTES, PHOTOGRAPHS, AND RESEARCH MATERIALS FOR BOOKS ON BOTH GUNG FU AND HISTHEN NEWLY CREATED MARTIAL ART OF JEET KUNE DO. IN ORDER TO SHED FURTHER LIGHTON LEE’S OWN PROCESS OF INTELLECTUAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A MARTIAL ARTIST,THESE MATERIALS ARE NOW PRESENTED THROUGH AN EXCLUSIVE AND EXHAUSTIVE PUBLISHINGPROJECT INVOLVING TUTTLE PUBLISHING AND THE BRUCE LEE ESTATE. I AM HONORED THATLINDA LEE CADWELL (LEE’S WIDOW) AND ADRIAN MARSHALL (LEE’S ATTORNEY) HAVESELECTED ME TO BE THE ONE UPON WHOSE SHOULDERS THIS GIANT AND HONORED TASK HASBEEN PLACED.TO THIS END—AND FOR THIS BOOK PARTICULARLY—I WILL ASK YOU TO FORGET ABOUT WHATYOU KNOW OR, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT CHINESE MARTIALART. I WANT YOU TO FORGET THE TERM “JEET KUNE DO” AND ANY PRECONCEPTIONS YOU MAYHAVE FORMED REGARDING IT. WHEN BRUCE LEE SAT DOWN TO WRITE THE CHAPTERS ANDNOTES THAT FORMED THIS PARTICULAR BOOK, IT WAS 1964 AND HIS MIND-SET WAS STILLVERY MUCH INFLUENCED BY THE TRADITIONAL CHINESE MASTERS OF THE PAST. I SHOULDMENTION IN FAIRNESS THAT LEE WAS ALREADY “NON-CLASSICAL” IN HIS OWN APPROACH TOMARTIAL ART, BUT ONLY INASMUCH AS HE HAD ALREADY STARTED TO QUESTION THEEFFICACY OF MANY OF THE SO-CALLED CHINESE “CLASSICAL” ARTS. NEVERTHELESS, EVENHIS OWN GUNG FU SYSTEM WOULD CONTINUE TO BE DEFINED BY A TAOIST PHILOSOPHYEMPHASIZING TRUTH, REALITY, AND THE WAY THINGS ACTUALLY ARE—AS OPPOSED TO HOW WEMIGHT WISH THEM TO BE.IN EDITING LEE’S MATERIALS, I HAVE TAKEN GREAT PAINS NOT TO ALTER ANY OF HISORIGINAL WRITINGS. WHEREVER THERE EXISTED A PAUCITY OF WRITTEN INFORMATION ON ASPECIFIC TOPIC THAT LEE HAD INTENDED TO INCLUDE IN HIS BOOK, I HAVE CONSULTEDHIS MANY NOTES AND AUDIO RECORDS FOR DIRECTION, NOMENCLATURE, AND INTENT.WHENEVER A GREAT MASTER HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN, IT ISASSUMED THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND THEREFORE NOT TO BE TOUCHED, “INTERPRETED,”OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I HAVE PROCEEDED WITH THISBOOK—AND ALL OTHER BRUCE LEE—RELATED PROJECTS I’M INVOLVED IN. IN THE CASE OFADAPTING LEE’S ROUGH NOTES (WHICH WERE OFTEN JOTTED DOWN ON AIRLINE STATIONARYAT 30,000 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND OR WHILE RIDING IN CARS), I HAVE ATTEMPTED TOFLESH OUT LEE’S POINT-FORM NOTATIONS WHILE REMAINING TRUE TO THE GIST OR THRUSTOF LEE’S POINT. ALL OF THE MANUSCRIPT AMENDMENTS AND ALTERATIONS HAVE BEEN RUNPAST THE DISCERNING EYES OF NOT ONLY LEE’S STUDENTS FROM THIS PARTICULAR ERA,BUT ALSO LINDA LEE CADWELL, WHOSE DEEP CONCERN AND PASSION FOR PRESERVING THEINTEGRITY OF HER HUSBAND’S WRITINGS CANNOT BE QUESTIONED. THESE WRITINGS COVER ASPAN OF ALMOST TWELVE YEARS AND, BECAUSE LEE WAS CONSTANTLY REFINING ANDREDUCING THE CORE ESSENTIALS OF WHAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME HIS ART OF JEETKUNE DO, SEPARATING LEE’S SEATTLE, OAKLAND, LOS ANGELES, AND EARLY AND LATERHONG KONG WRITINGS ON THE MARTIAL WAY INTO THEIR APPROPRIATE ERAS HAS MADE FORQUITE A TASK. THERE ARE STILL THOSE AMONG LEE’S STUDENTS WHO DO NOT WISH FOR HISMETHODS, IDEAS, AND OPINIONS TO BE TAUGHT TO OTHERS. THEY ZEALOUSLY GUARD WHAT(IN SOME INSTANCES) HAS PROVEN TO BE SOME KNOWLEDGE THEY HAPPENED TO OBTAINFIRST HAND FROM BRUCE LEE AS IF IT WERE HOLY WRIT. HOWEVER, IN THIS AUTHOR’SOPINION, SUCH SECRECY RUNS CONTRARY TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF BRUCE LEE—A MAN WHOFOUGHT ALL OF HIS LIFE FOR THE RIGHT OF PERSONS, REGARDLESS OF SKIN COLOR ORETHNIC ORIGINS, TO LEARN WHATEVER THEY FEEL WILL BENEFIT THEM. ADDITIONALLY,SUCH A GUARDED POSITION ONLY RESULTS IN HALF-TRUTHS BEING PROPAGATED AND VALIDQUESTIONS RAISED THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED. THIS DENIES JUSTICE TO THE LEGACY OF AGREAT MAN AND TO HIS POSTERITY—BOTH BLOOD AND INTELLECTUAL. AS AMERICANPHILOSOPHER AND PULITZER PRIZE-WINNER WILL DURANT ONCE SAID IN THE PREFACE TOHIS BOOK, THE STORY OF PHILOSOPHY:LET US NOT, THEN, BE ASHAMED OF TEACHING PEOPLE. THOSE JEALOUS ONES WHO WOULDGUARD THEIR KNOWLEDGE FROM THE WORLD HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME IF THEIREXCLUSIVENESS AND THEIR BARBAROUS TERMINOLOGY HAVE LED THE WORLD TO SEEK INBOOKS, IN LECTURES, AND IN ADULT EDUCATION, THE INSTRUCTION WHICH THEYTHEMSELVES HAVE FAILED TO GIVE. LET THEM BE GRATEFUL THAT THEIR HALTING EFFORTSARE AIDED BY AMATEURS WHO LOVE LIFE ENOUGH TO LET IT HUMANIZE THEIR TEACHING.PERHAPS EACH KIND OF TEACHER CAN BE OF AID TO THE OTHER: THE CAUTIOUS SCHOLAR TOCHECK OUR ENTHUSIASM WITH ACCURACY, AND THE ENTHUSIAST TO POUR WARMTH AND BLOODINTO THE FRUITS OF SCHOLARSHIP. BETWEEN US WE MIGHT BUILD UP IN AMERICA ANAUDIENCE FIT TO LISTEN TO GENIUSES, AND THEREFORE READY TO PRODUCE THEM. WE AREALL IMPERFECT TEACHERS, BUT WE MAY BE FORGIVEN IF WE HAVE ADVANCED THE MATTER ALITTLE, AND HAVE DONE OUR BEST. WE ANNOUNCE THE PROLOGUE, AND RETIRE; AFTER USBETTER PLAYERS WILL COME.IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT WE NOW PROCEED."},{"pageContent":"FOREWORDBY TAKY KIMURAPLEASE ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JOHN LITTLE HASGIVEN ME TO SHARE A FEW WORDS ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE WORLD’SGREAT ICONS, BRUCE LEE.JOHN AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR OVER A YEAR, AND I HAVE COME TO RESPECT HISSINCERITY AND ENJOY HIS FRIENDSHIP MORE AND MORE AS TIME GOES BY. JOHN, LIKEMANY OF US, HAS EXCITEDLY WORSHIPPED AND INSPIRED HIMSELF TO BECOME THE BESTTHAT HE CAN BE AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPOSED TO THE GREAT BRUCE LEE; CONFIDENT YETHUMBLE, GENUINELY ASSERTIVE BUT SENSITIVE TO OTHERS. IT IS MY HUMBLE OPINION(AND NO SMALL TASK!) THAT JOHN HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO RESEARCHING,PRESENTING, AND, WHERE NECESSARY, EXTRAPOLATING—IN THE MOST SINCERE MANNER—THATWHICH BRUCE HAS LEFT US IN HIS MANY VOLUMES OF WRITINGS AND PRIVATE NOTES, SOTHAT WE MAY ALL COME TO UNDERSTAND AND SHARE IN BRUCE’S ART AND PHILOSOPHY.BRUCE LEE WAS A MULTITALENTED PERSON EVEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AS HEBRIGHTENED THE HORIZONS OF SEATTLE. HIS FIVE-FOOT-SEVEN-INCH FRAME WOULD EXPLODEUPON ANY GIVEN STAGE WITH THE AWESOMENESS OF A COMET AND YOU WERE IMMEDIATELYCAPTIVATED BY HIS LOVABLE PERSONALITY. BRUCE ONCE SHARED WITH ME THE SENTIMENTTHAT HE WAS RELAXED AND COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE FROM ALL STRATA OF SOCIETY. HEATTRIBUTED THIS TO THE ULTIMATE ESSENCE OF THE PHYSICALITY AND SPIRITUALITY OFTHE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MARTIAL ART. IN MY OPINION, THIS WAS IMBUED IN HIM, ANDBRUCE LIVED AND DIED THE LIFE OF A TRUE WARRIOR.I HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO BRUCE WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.HOWEVER I WAS ALSO FORTUNATE IN BEING ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE MANY OTHER ASPECTSOF HIS PERSONALITY, SUCH AS THE TEENAGE COMEDIAN AND THE MATURE PHILOSOPHER. IFELT PARTICULARLY ENCHANTED BY THIS LAST CHARACTERISTIC AND SOMEHOW KNEW THAT IHAD TO FOLLOW HIM.FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BACKGROUND OF BRUCE LEE—THE MAN WHO WOULD IN TIMECOME TO WRITE THE BOOK YOU ARE NOW HOLDING IN YOUR HANDS—IT MAY HELP IF I TAKE AMOMENT TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW HE CAME TO INTRODUCE GUNG FU, A UNIQUELY CHINESEART, TO NORTH AMERICA. BRUCE ARRIVED IN SEATTLE IN 1959 AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN,AFTER A BRIEF SOJOURN IN SAN FRANCISCO. WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL LOCALTELEVISION APPEARANCES AND PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS, BRUCE BEGAN TO GIVEINSTRUCTION TO ALL AMERICANS—REGARDLESS OF RACE, CREED, OR NATIONAL ORIGIN.EVEN WHILE GROWING UP IN HONG KONG, BRUCE HAD EXPERIENCED HIS FAIR SHARE OFPREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION. THIS LED HIM TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MARTIALARTS FOR BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SELF-PRESERVATION. HE OFTEN SPOKE TO ME OF THEWAY THE BRITISH OFFICERS LOOKED DOWN UPON AND MISTREATED THE CHINESE. FROM THISBACKGROUND, BRUCE SWORE TO USE THE MARTIAL ARTS AS A TOOL TO EXPRESS HISULTIMATE DESIRE: TO CREATE EQUALITY AMONG THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.EVEN IN SEATTLE DURING THIS EARLY STAGE OF HIS LIFE’S JOURNEY, BRUCE DENOUNCEDTHE “CLASSICAL MESS” AND PROMOTED THE ART OF SIMPLICITY AND HARMONY. IN TIME,BRUCE WOULD MODIFY HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE MANY ARTS TO ARRIVE AT THE ULTIMATESTAGE OF REALISTIC SIMPLICITY: JEET KUNE DO. HOWEVER, WHETHER HE WAS INSTRUCTINGHIS STUDENTS IN THE JUN FAN METHOD OF GUNG FU OR IN JEET KUNE DO, BRUCEUNDERSTOOD THAT IN EITHER CASE, SIMPLICITY, HONESTY, AND DESIRE COMES ONLY FROMDEEP WITHIN YOUR HEART, AND HE INCORPORATED THIS PRECIOUS CHARACTERISTIC INTOALL OF HIS TEACHINGS.BRUCE WAS UNIQUELY POSSESSED WITH NATURAL-BORN ATTRIBUTES: SPEED, COORDINATION,GRACEFULNESS, HIGH MENTALITY, AND CHARM. ALL OF THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO HISKEEN SENSE OF SEPARATING REALITY FROM FANTASY. RATHER THAN CONDEMN ANYPARTICULAR SYSTEM OF MARTIAL ART, BRUCE ABSORBED WHAT WAS USEFUL AND DISCARDEDWHAT WAS USELESS, AND HE TAUGHT US WHAT HE CONSIDERED THE “REALITY” OF MARTIALART—SIMPLICITY, HARMONY, AND INTEGRITY.THIS IS IN MANY WAYS COMPARABLE TO THE ULTIMATE BEAUTY THAT RESIDES IN THE WAYYOUNG CHILDREN EXPRESSES THEMSELVES IN THE MOST SIMPLE, SPONTANEOUS, FLOWINGMANNER. THEIR SINCERITY OF EMOTION JUST COMES FORTH NATURALLY. BRUCE PREACHED TOUS ABOUT THE COLD FACTS OF LIFE: FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A SWIMMER,YOU CANNOT DO SO ON DRY LAND, YOU MUST ENTER THE WATER. HE SHARED WITH ME ANDALL WHO STUDIED WITH HIM THE ABSOLUTES: HONESTY, RESPECT TO ALL, HUMILITY,CONFIDENCE, AND THE CULTIVATING OF AN INSATIABLE DESIRE TO REACH YOUR GOAL!WHEN BRUCE WAS ALIVE, HE ALWAYS PUSHED ME IN A DIRECTION THAT I BELIEVE HE WOULDWISH ALL OF US TO FOLLOW: TO FULFILL TO THE UTMOST YOUR PHYSICAL CAPABILITIESWHICH ENABLE YOU TO IDENTIFY WHO YOU REALLY ARE WITH HUMILITY AND PRIDE. ONCETHIS IS ACCOMPLISHED, THE DOOR WILL OPEN AND YOU WILL ENTER THE KINGDOM OFPHILOSOPHICAL SPIRITUALITY.THE SEATTLE CURRICULUM THAT BRUCE ENTRUSTED ME TO TEACH, AND WHICH JOHN HASINCLUDED IN THE APPENDIX OF THIS BOOK, BEGAN WITH THIS UNIQUE AND SIMPLE CONCEPTOF TRUTH AND REALITY.EVEN NOW, MY BLOOD BECOMES FEVERISH WHEN I REFLECT UPON THOSE BYGONE DAYS WHENBRUCE AND I WERE TOGETHER. HE INGENIOUSLY HELPED ME TO RECAPTURE THE DAYS I LOSTHAVING BEEN INTERNED FOR FIVE YEARS IN AN AMERICAN CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR SIMPLYHAVING BEEN BORN OF JAPANESE DESCENT. I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL ANDBRUCE PROVIDED ME WITH A THERAPY OF SORTS—JUST BEING ABLE TO “HANG OUT” AND DOSOME OF THE LIGHT-HEARTED, CRAZY THINGS THAT I HAD MISSED OUT ON AND BEENDEPRIVED OF DURING MY INTERNMENT. THE BITTERNESS, NEGATIVENESS, AND THE FEELINGOF COMPLETE INFERIORITY THAT PLAGUED ME IN THE DAYS BEFORE BRUCE LEE CAME INTOMY LIFE, ARE—AS A DIRECT RESULT OF HIS TEACHINGS AND MY OWN WILLINGNESS TO APPLYTHEM—NOW JUST WATER THAT HAS PASSED UNDER THE BRIDGE. I REALIZE NOW THAT THEREWAS A CONCEALED, HIDDEN ENRICHMENT THAT I GLEANED FROM MY EXPERIENCES, BOTHPOSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, THAT HAS SERVED TO MAKE ME A BETTER PERSON TODAY.BRUCE USED TO SAY “HE WHO KNOWS BUT KNOWS NOT HE KNOWS, HE IS ASLEEP—AWAKENHIM.” ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT COME TO APPRECIATE THIS STATEMENT UNTIL MANY YEARSLATER, I AM THANKFUL THAT HE “FILLED MY CUP” WITHOUT MY EVEN REALIZING IT,SOMEHOW KNOWING THAT I “KNEW NOT THAT I KNEW.”I HAVE MANY CHERISHED MEMORIES OF BRUCE. WE TRAINED TOGETHER, ATE TOGETHER, WENTTO MOVIES TOGETHER, AND TALKED ABOUT EVERY TOPIC UNDER THE SUN. I VIVIDLYREMEMBER APPEARING WITH BRUCE WHEN HE GAVE MARTIAL ART DEMONSTRATIONS IN SEATTLEAND CALIFORNIA, WHERE I EXPERIENCED THE HAIR-RAISING EFFECT OF FACING HISPUNCHES AND KICKS, WHICH WOULD EXPLODE TOWARD ME WITH THE POWER AND SPEED OF AHURRICANE, ONLY TO STOP A FRACTION OF AN INCH FROM MY FACE. THE FORCE OF THEBREEZE CAUSED BY HIS BLOWS WOULD LITERALLY “PART” MY HAIR!BRUCE WAS MY MENTOR, MY SIFU, MY ADVISOR, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, MY FRIEND. HEEMBODIED THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLES OF THE TRUE MARTIAL ARTIST."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONImage [../Images/19a.jpg]THIS BOOK WAS NOT WRITTEN WITH ANY INTENTION OF PRESENTING A COMPLETE TEXTBOOKON CHINESE BOXING.

INTHE MIDST OF ANTIQUITY, GUNG FU WAS SIMPLY A NATURAL, PRIMITIVE, NO-HOLDS-BARREDTYPE OF FIGHTING WITH HANDS AND FEET. ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT SO SCIENTIFIC, THEMETHOD NEVERTHELESS WAS NATURAL AND FREE, WITHOUT ANY INHIBITION. THE ACTION WASNOT RESTRAINED, ARRESTED, OR CHECKED. AS TIME WENT ON, THE RUDIMENTARYTECHNIQUES OF THE ART WERE “INTELLECTUALLY” IMPROVED FURTHER AND, ALTHOUGH THETECHNIQUES WERE DEFINITELY SUPERIOR TO THE PRIMITIVE METHOD, THE REFINEDSCIENTIFIC ART WAS FINITE AND NOT AS FREE AND NATURAL. FURTHERMORE, BY THIS TOOPHILOSOPHICAL AND TOO SCIENTIFIC, OBJECTIVE APPROACH, THE HIDDEN RECESSES OF THEMIND COULD NOT BE PENETRATED. DURING THAT STAGE, MOST OF THE TECHNIQUESCONSISTED OF FANCY MECHANICAL MOTION AND UNNECESSARY STEPS TOWARD THE DESIREDEND. IN SHORT, IT WAS A COMPLICATED MESS.AS THE CENTURIES WENT BY, COUNTLESS GENERATIONS OF THE ART’S PRACTITIONERSEMERGED, GRADUALLY PERFECTING IT, SMOOTHING OUT THE ROUGH SPOTS, POLISHING THETECHNIQUES UNTIL GUNG FU CHANGED INTO A SMOOTH, FLOWING “SIMPLIFIED” WAY OFSELF-DEFENSE. THIS SIMPLICITY WAS THE RESULT OF ENDLESS EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTSAND PROFOUND THOUGHT ON THE ORIGINAL HIGHLY COMPLICATED METHOD OF COMBAT. ALLTECHNIQUES BECAME THE “ONE” WITHOUT OPPOSITES, INFINITE AND UNCEASING, AND ALLMOVEMENTS WERE STRIPPED TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, WITHOUT ANY WASTED ANDUNNECESSARY MOTIONS. THIS TRANSFORMATION WAS INFLUENCED GREATLY BY THE IDEALS OFTAOISM, CH’AN (ZEN) AND THE I’CHING AT THAT TIME.TO ILLUSTRATE THIS STAGE OF SIMPLICITY, I WOULD LIKE TO TURN TO THE CHINESELANGUAGE. ABOUT HALF A CENTURY AGO, MOST LANGUAGE EXPERTS CALLED THE CHINESELANGUAGE “BABY TALK.” THEY APPARENTLY DIDN’T APPRECIATE THE WORD SIMPLICITYBECAUSE THEY WERE SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THE CHINESE LANGUAGE HAS NO GENDERS,NO CASES, NO TENSES, NO VOICES, NO NUMBERS, ETC. (ACTUALLY WHAT THE CHINESELANGUAGE DOES NOT HAVE IS RATHER UNBELIEVABLE!). HOWEVER, AFTER YEARS OFRESEARCH, THE LANGUAGE EXPERTS FINALLY FOUND OUT THAT THIS “GRAMMERLESS”LANGUAGE DID HAVE A COMPLICATED GRAMMAR SYSTEM LIKE THEIRS BUT WAS LATER ONSIMPLIFIED INTO THE PRESENT-DAY STREAMLINED, SMOOTH-FLOWING LANGUAGE. INSTEAD OFA “BABY TALK” LANGUAGE, CHINESE IS THE MOST NATURAL GROWN-UP LANGUAGE IN THEWORLD.IN SCHOOL THE CHINESE CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE TO FACE THE HEADACHE OF GRAMMAR ANDWHAT THEY LEARN IS TO PUT THE RIGHT CHARACTER INTO THE RIGHT ORDER OF ASENTENCE—AND THAT’S ALL.OBSERVE SOME BASIC SIMPLIFICATION. INSTEAD OF SAYING “TWO MEN,” THE CHINESEWOULD SAY “TWO MAN” BECAUSE HERE THE NUMBER “TWO” ALREADY SIGNIFIES HOW MANY. INCORRECT ENGLISH ONE SAYS “YESTERDAY I WENT,” BUT IN CHINESE, THEY SAY “YESTERDAYI GO” FOR THE WORD “YESTERDAY” HAS ALREADY SUGGESTED AN EVENT THAT HAS OCCURREDIN THE PAST. IF THE CHINESE WANTED TO SAY “I DID THAT,” THEY SAID “I FINISH DOTHAT”; FOR “A MAN OF INABILITY” THEY SAY “A NO ABILITY MAN,” ETC. (THESE ARE BUTA FEW EXAMPLES AND IF THE READERS ARE INTERESTED THEY CAN FIND OUT MOREINFORMATION FROM BOOKS ON THAT SUBJECT.)THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, IS DOING JUST THE SAME AS THECHINESE—MOVING TO SIMPLIFY ITS STRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION. AMONG THE WESTERNLANGUAGES, ENGLISH IS THE MOST FLEXIBLE, SIMPLE, AND PRACTICAL (NOTE, FORINSTANCE, THE GRAMMAR OF FRENCH AND LATIN). IT IS NOW APPROACHING THE STAGE THATTHE CHINESE ACHIEVED SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS AGO. (NOTE: FOR SIMILAR THOUGHTS ONTHE SIMPLICITY OF MOVEMENT, PLEASE REFER TO THE THIRD SECTION OF THIS BOOKREGARDING TAOISM.)RETURNING TO THE TOPIC OF GUNG FU, THE WORD GUNG FU MEANS “TRAINING” OR “WORK”BUT IN THE SENSE OF MARTIAL ART, GUNG FU MEANS TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE TOWARDTHE WAY TO THE OBJECT—BE IT THE WAY TO HEALTH PROMOTION, TO SPIRITUALCULTIVATION, OR TO THE WAY OF SELF-DEFENSE.GEOGRAPHICALLY, CHINESE GUNG FU WAS, AND INDEED, STILL IS, DIVIDED INTO NORTHERNAND SOUTHERN SCHOOLS. THE NORTHERN SCHOOLS ARE GENERALLY NOTED FOR THEIR KICKING(USUALLY HIGH OR FLYING KICKS) AND THEIR LONG-RANGE STYLE. THE SOUTHERN SCHOOLS,ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE RENOWNED FOR THEIR HAND-TO-HAND CLOSE-RANGE STYLE. OFCOURSE, THIS IS NOT A SET RULE.GUNG FU IS THE ALL-EMBRACING NAME FOR ALL SCHOOLS OF CHINESE MARTIAL ART, SUCHAS THE HUNG SYSTEM, THE WHITE CRANE SYSTEM, THE TAI-CHI CH’UAN SYSTEM, THE WINGCHUN SYSTEM, THE PRAYING MANTIS SYSTEM, ETC. ONE CAN SAY HE KNOWS THE HUNG ORTHE LEE, BUT NOT GUNG FU, AS THE WORD INCLUDES ALL TECHNIQUES OF ALL SCHOOLS,THE 72 JOINT LOCKS, THE 36 THROWS, AND THE WAYS OF THE 18 DIFFERENT WEAPONS.THERE IS NO HUMAN BEING ALIVE THAT KNOWS AND CAN USE GUNG FU AS A WHOLE, ANDEVEN IF ONE COULD BE INDISCRIMINATELY ACCEPTED BY ALL THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS FORINSTRUCTION, IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN ONE’S LIFETIME TO ACQUIRE PROFICIENCY INALL OF THESE VARIED DISCIPLINES.Image [../Images/24a.jpg]GUNG FU, THE PREVALENT TERM USED IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY, IS KNOWN AS MOSUIRT (WU-SHU IN MANDARIN) OR GOK SUIRT (KUO SHU IN RED CHINA, FORMOSA, AND HONGKONG). HOWEVER, NEITHER OF THESE TWO TERMS SIGNIFIES TOO MUCH, AS MOSUIRT—MEANING MARTIAL ART—CAN REFER TO ANY SPECIFIC SYSTEM OF MARTIAL ART, WHILEGOK SUIRT—MEANING NATIONAL ART—CAN REFER TO ANY FORM OF ART, INCLUDING MUSIC,DANCING, AND PAINTING.STILL, THE TERM GUNG FU IS NOT USED INCORRECTLY IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FACT,IT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TERM FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. THE ORIGINALMEANING OF THE WORD GUNG FU IS “ACCUMULATION OF WORK OR TRAINING.” HOWEVER, INTHE SENSE OF MARTIAL ART, GUNG FU MEANS TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE TOWARD THEULTIMATE REALITY OF THE OBJECT, WHETHER THE OBJECT BE HEALTH PROMOTION,CULTIVATION OF MIND, OR SELF-PROTECTION.THREE STAGES OF CULTIVATIONTHERE ARE THREE STAGES IN THE CULTIVATION OF GUNG FU. NAMELY, THE PRIMITIVESTAGE, THE STAGE OF ART, AND THE STAGE OF ARTLESSNESS. THE PRIMITIVE STAGE ISTHE STAGE OF IGNORANCE IN WHICH A PERSON KNOWS NOTHING OF THE ART OF COMBAT ANDIN A FIGHT HE SIMPLY BLOCKS AND HITS “INSTINCTIVELY.” THE SECOND STAGE (THESTAGE OF ART) BEGINS WHEN HE STARTS HIS TRAINING IN GUNG FU. IN HIS LESSONS, HEIS TAUGHT THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF BLOCKING AND STRIKING, THE FORMS, THE WAY TOSTAND, TO KICK, ETC. UNQUESTIONABLY HE HAS GAINED A SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OFCOMBAT, BUT HIS ORIGINAL “SELF” AND SENSE OF FREEDOM ARE LOST. HIS MIND “STOPS”AT VARIOUS MOVEMENTS FOR INTELLECTUAL ANALYSIS AND CALCULATIONS. HIS ACTION NOLONGER FLOWS BY ITSELF. THE THIRD STAGE (THE STAGE OF ARTLESSNESS) ARRIVES WHENHIS TRAINING REACHES MATURITY; HIS TECHNIQUES ARE PERFORMED ON AN ALMOSTUNCONSCIOUS LEVEL WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM HIS MIND. INSTEAD OF “I HIT,” ITBECOMES “IT HITS!” THIS IS THE STAGE OF CULTIVATED IGNORANCE. IN OTHER WORDS,BEFORE I LEARNED MARTIAL ART, A PUNCH WAS JUST LIKE A PUNCH, A KICK JUST LIKE AKICK. AFTER I LEARNED MARTIAL ART, A PUNCH WAS NO LONGER A PUNCH, A KICK NOLONGER A KICK. FINALLY, AFTER I UNDERSTOOD MARTIAL ART, A PUNCH IS JUST LIKE APUNCH, A KICK JUST LIKE A KICK.THESE THREE STAGES ALSO APPLY TO THE VARIOUS METHODS BEING PRACTICED IN GUNG FU.SOME METHODS ARE RATHER PRIMITIVE WITH JERKY, BASIC BLOCKING AND STRIKING; ONTHE WHOLE, THEY LACK THE FLOW AND CHANGE OF COMBINATION. SOME “SOPHISTICATED”SYSTEMS, ON THE OTHER HAND, TEND TO RUN TO ORNAMENTATION AND GET CARRIED AWAYWITH GRACE AND SHOWMANSHIP. THEY, WHETHER FROM THE SO-CALLED EXTERNAL (FIRM) ORINTERNAL (GENTLE) SCHOOL, OFTEN INVOLVE BIG OR FANCY MOTIONS WITH A LOT OFCOMPLICATED STEPS OR CIRCLES TOWARD A SINGLE GOAL. THEY ARE TOO PHILOSOPHICALLYINVOLVED (INTELLECTUALLY BOUND) AND DO NOT WANT TO COME OFF WITH SOPHISTICATION.IT IS LIKE AN ARTIST WHO, NOT SATISFIED WITH DRAWING A SIMPLE SNAKE, PROCEEDS TOPUT FOUR BEAUTIFUL AND SHAPELY FEET ON THE SNAKE! WHEN GRASPED BY THE COLLAR,FOR EXAMPLE, THESE PRACTITIONERS WOULD “FIRST UNBALANCE AND/OR SIDE STEP” (THIS,OF COURSE, IS THE DIVINE PRINCIPLE OF THE CIRCLE—IN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING YOUMUST FIRST GIVE) OR BREAK LOOSE FORCIBLY BY STRIKING THE OPPONENT’S HAND (THUSTEARING ONE’S SHIRT), OR “FLOW” WITH THE MOVEMENT AND DISSOLVE BY TURNING ORRUNNING CIRCLES (PROVIDING, OF COURSE, THAT YOUR OPPONENT JUST STANDS THEREHOLDING ON AND WATCHING ALL OF THIS)—THEN THEY WOULD STRIKE AND/OR KICK AND/ORLOCK AND BREAK THE JOINTS AND/OR THROW THEIR OPPONENT. HOWEVER, THE DIRECT WAYIS TO LET HIM HAVE THE PLEASURE OF GRASPING THE COLLAR AND SIMPLY PUNCH HIM INTHE NOSE! (TO SOME MARTIAL ARTISTS OF DISTINGUISHING TASTE, THIS WOULD BE ALITTLE BIT UNSOPHISTICATED, TOO ORDINARY AND UNARTFUL.) ON THE WHOLE, THEFOLLOWERS OF THESE METHODS ARE EITHER TOO INTELLECTUALLY BOUND OR TOO PHYSICALLYBOUND AND DO NOT WISH TO SEE THE PLAIN TRUTH.Image [../Images/26a.jpg]WHICH LEADS US TO THE SCHOOLS OF PROFOUND SIMPLICITY, A NATURAL RESULT OFEXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTATION OF HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED COMPLEXITY. ALL TECHNIQUESARE STRIPPED TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND THE UTMOST IS NOW EXPRESSED ANDPERFORMED WITH THE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTS AND ENERGY. THERE IS NO ORNAMENTATION ORWASTE, AND EVERYTHING BECOMES THE STRAIGHTEST, MOST LOGICAL SIMPLICITY OFCOMMON-SENSE (THIS STAGE OF SIMPLICITY IS NOT BASIC OR PRIMITIVE AND CANNOT BEACHIEVED WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE SECOND STAGE).AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE OBJECT OF GUNG FU IS FOR HEALTH PROMOTION, CULTIVATIONOF MIND, AND SELF-PROTECTION. TOWARD THIS END, ITS PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THEINTEGRAL PARTS OF THE PHILOSOPHIES OF TAOISM, CH’AN (ZEN), AND I’CHING—THEIDEALS OF ATTUNING WITH NATURE, AND OF HARMONY OF YIN AND YANG ARE STRESSED(PLEASE SEE THE NEXT SECTION ON YIN AND YANG). THE WHOLE IDEA IS NOT TO DOMINATEYOUR OPPONENT BUT TO ACHIEVE HARMONY WITH HIM. JUST AS A BUTCHER PRESERVES HISKNIFE BY CUTTING ALONG THE LINE OF THE BONE, A GUNG FU MAN PRESERVES HIMSELF BYCOMPLEMENTING—AND NOT OPPOSING—THE FORCE OF HIS OPPONENT. IN ORDER TO RECONCILEONESELF TO THE CHANGING MOVEMENTS OF THE OPPONENT, A GUNG FU MAN SHOULD FIRST OFALL UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF YIN/YANG—THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF GUNG FU.ON YIN AND YANGTHE BASIC STRUCTURE OF GUNG FU IS BASED ON THE THEORY OF YIN AND YANG, A PAIR OFMUTUALLY COMPLEMENTARY AND INTERDEPENDENT FORCES THAT ACT CONTINUOUSLY, WITHOUTCESSATION, IN THIS UNIVERSE. TO THE CHINESE, HARMONY IS REGARDED AS THE BASICPRINCIPLE OF THE WORLD ORDER, AS A COSMIC FIELD OF FORCE IN WHICH THE YIN ANDTHE YANG ARE ETERNALLY COMPLEMENTARY AND ETERNALLY CHANGING. EUROPEAN DUALISMSEES PHYSICAL AND METAPHYSICAL AS TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES, AT BEST AS CAUSE ANDEFFECT, BUT NEVER PAIRED LIKE SOUND AND ECHO, OR LIGHT AND SHADOW, AS IN THECHINESE SYMBOL OF ALL HAPPENING: THE YIN/YANG.Image [../Images/28a.jpg]THE ABOVE FIGURE SHOWS THE SYMBOL OF TAI CHI OR, IN CANTONESE, THE TAI KIK INWHICH THE YIN AND YANG ARE TWO INTERLOCKING PARTS OF ONE WHOLE, EACH CONTAININGWITHIN ITS CONFINES THE QUALITIES OF ITS COMPLEMENTARIES. ETYMOLOGICALLY THECHARACTERS OF YIN AND YANG MEAN DARKNESS AND LIGHT. THE ANCIENT CHARACTER OFYIN, THE BLACK PART OF THE CIRCLE, IS A DRAWING OF CLOUDS AND HILL.YIN CAN REPRESENT ANYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE AS:• NEGATIVENESS• PASSIVENESS• GENTLENESS• INTERNAL• INSUBSTANTIALITY• FEMALENESS• MOON• DARKNESS• NIGHT, ETC.THE OTHER COMPLEMENTARY PART OF THE CIRCLE IS YANG. THE LOWER PART OF THECHARACTER SIGNIFIES SLANTING SUNRAYS, WHILE THE UPPER PART REPRESENTS THE SUN.YANG CAN REPRESENT ANYTHING AS:• POSITIVENESS• ACTIVENESS• FIRMNESS• EXTERNAL• SUBSTANTIALITY• MALENESS• SUN• BRIGHTNESS• DAY, ETC.THE COMMON MISTAKE OF THE WESTERN WORLD IS TO IDENTIFY THESE TWO FORCES, YIN ANDYANG, AS DUALISTIC; THAT IS, YANG BEING THE OPPOSITE OF YIN, AND VICE VERSA. ASLONG AS THIS “ONENESS” IS VIEWED AS TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES, REALIZATION OF THETAO OF GUNG FU WON’T BE ACHIEVED. IN REALITY THINGS ARE “WHOLE” AND CANNOT BESEPARATED INTO PARTS. WHEN I SAY THE HEAT MAKES ME PERSPIRE, THE HEAT ANDPERSPIRING ARE JUST ONE PROCESS AS THEY ARE COEXISTENT AND THE ONE COULD NOTEXIST BUT FOR THE OTHER. JUST AS AN OBJECT NEEDS A SUBJECT, THE PERSON INQUESTION IS NOT TAKING AN INDEPENDENT POSITION BUT IS ACTING AS AN ASSISTANT.THE DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY, HOWEVER, REIGNED SUPREME IN EUROPE, DOMINATING THEDEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN SCIENCE. BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF ATOMIC PHYSICS, FINDINGSBASED ON DEMONSTRABLE EXPERIMENT WERE SEEN TO NEGATE THE DUALISTIC THEORY ANDTHE TREND OF THOUGHT SINCE THEN HAS LED BACK TOWARD THE MONISTIC CONCEPTION OFTHE ANCIENT TAOISTS. IN ATOMIC PHYSICS NO DISTINCTION IS RECOGNIZED BETWEENMATTER AND ENERGY; NOR IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE SUCH A DISTINCTION, SINCE THEY AREIN REALITY ONE ESSENCE, OR AT LEAST TWO POLES OF THE SAME UNIT. IT IS NO LONGERPOSSIBLE, AS IT WAS IN THE MECHANISTIC SCIENTIFIC ERA, TO ABSOLUTELY DEFINEWEIGHT, LENGTH, OR TIME, ETC., AS THE WORK OF EINSTEIN, PLANK, WHITEHEAD, ANDJEANS HAS DEMONSTRATED IT IS.IN THE SAME WAY, THE TAOIST PHILOSOPHY, AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF WHICHACUPUNCTURE HAD ITS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPED, IS ESSENTIALLY MONISTIC. THE CHINESECONCEIVED THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE AS ACTIVATED BY TWO PRINCIPLES, THE YANG AND THEYIN, THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, AND THEY CONSIDERED THAT NOTHING THAT EXISTS,EITHER ANIMATE OR SO-CALLED INANIMATE, DOES SO, EXCEPT BY VIRTUE OF THECEASELESS INTERPLAY OF THESE TWO FORCES. MATTER AND ENERGY, YANG AND YIN, HEAVENAND EARTH, ARE CONCEIVED OF AS ESSENTIALLY ONE OR AS TWO COEXISTENT POLES OF ONEINDIVISIBLE WHOLE. AGAIN, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEENMATTER AND ENERGY BECAUSE THEY ARE IN REALITY TWO POLES OF THE SAME UNIT. THINGSDO HAVE THEIR COMPLEMENTARIES, AND COMPLEMENTARIES COEXIST AND, INSTEAD OF BEINGMUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, ARE IN FACT MUTUALLY DEPENDENT AND ARE A FUNCTION EACH OFTHE OTHER.NATURAL BALANCE INHERENT IN ALL THINGSIN THE YIN/YANG SYMBOL THERE IS A WHITE SPOT ON THE BLACK PART AND A BLACK SPOTON THE WHITE PART. THIS IS TO ILLUSTRATE THE BALANCE IN LIFE, FOR NOTHING CANSURVIVE LONG BY GOING TO EITHER EXTREMES, BE IT PURE YIN (NEGATIVENESS) OR PUREYANG (POSITIVENESS). EXTREME HEAT KILLS AS DOES EXTREME COLD. NO VIOLENTEXTREMES ENDURE. NOTHING LASTS BUT SOBER MODERATION. NOTICE THAT THE STIFFESTTREE IS MOST EASILY CRACKED, WHILE THE BAMBOO OR WILLOW SURVIVE BY BENDING WITHTHE WIND. FIRMNESS WITHOUT PLIANCY IS LIKE A BARREL WITHOUT WATER, AND PLIANCYWITHOUT FIRMNESS IS LIKE WATER WITHOUT A BARREL. IN GUNG FU, YANG (POSITIVENESS)SHOULD BE CONCEALED IN YIN (NEGATIVENESS, WHICH IS REPRESENTED SYMBOLICALLY BYTHE WHITE SPOT ON THE BLACK PART), AND YIN (NEGATIVENESS) IN YANG (POSITIVENESS,WHICH IS REPRESENTED SYMBOLICALLY BY THE BLACK SPOT ON THE WHITE PART). A GUNGFU MAN, THEN, SHOULD BE SOFT—YET NOT YIELDING; FIRM—YET NOT HARD.WHEN THE MOVEMENT OF YIN/YANG FLOWS INTO EXTREMES, REACTION SETS IN. FOR WHENYANG GOES TO THE EXTREME, IT CHANGES BACK TO YIN AND VICE VERSA, EACH BEING THECAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN ONE WORKS TO THE EXTREME, HEBECOMES TIRED AND HAS TO REST (A TRANSITION FROM YANG TO YIN). AFTER RESTING, HECAN WORK AGAIN (A TRANSITION OF YIN BACK TO YANG). THIS INCESSANT CHANGING OFYIN/YANG IS ALWAYS CONTINUOUS.THEREFORE, IN GUNG FU ONE SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH, AND NOT IN OPPOSITIONAGAINST, THE FORCE OF ONE’S OPPONENT. SUPPOSE A APPLIES FORCE ON B; B SHOULDN’TOPPOSE OR COMPLETELY GIVE WAY TO IT (FOR THESE ARE BUT THE TWO EXTREME OPPOSITESOF B’S REACTION TO A’S FORCE). INSTEAD, B SHOULD COMPLETE A’S FORCE WITH ALESSER FORCE (FIRMNESS IN GENTLENESS) AND LEAD HIM TO THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWNMOVEMENT. THIS SPONTANEOUS ASSISTING OF A’S MOVEMENT AS HE AIMS IT WILL RESULTIN HIS OWN DEFEAT. AGAIN, AS THE BUTCHER PRESERVES HIS KNIFE BY CUTTING ALONGTHE BARRIER OF THE BONE AND NOT AGAINST IT, A GUNG FU MAN PRESERVES HIMSELF BYFOLLOWING THE MOVEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT WITHOUT OPPOSITION.ON BRIDGING THE GAP OF YIN AND YANGImage [../Images/32a.jpg]GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS (YIN AND YANG) ARE TWO “INTERDEPENDENT” AND“COMPLEMENTARY” FORCES IN THE CHINESE ART OF GUNG FU, AND THE AIM IS THEATTAINMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN THESE TWO FORCES.GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS IS ONE INSEPARABLE FORCE OF ONCE UNCEASING INTERPLAY OFMOVEMENT. IF A PERSON RIDING A BICYCLE WISHES TO GO SOMEWHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, HECAN'T PUMP ON BOTH THE PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME OR NOT PUMP ON THEM AT ALL. INORDER TO MOVE FORWARD HE PUMPS ON ONE PEDAL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RELEASING THEOTHER. SO THE MOVEMENT OF GOING FORWARD REQUIRES THIS “ONENESS” OF PUMPING ANDRELEASING. PUMPING THEN IS THE RESULT OF RELEASING AND VICE VERSA, EACH BEINGTHE CAUSE OF THE OTHER.THIS ONENESS OF THINGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHINESE MIND. IN THE CHINESELANGUAGE EVENTS ARE LOOKED ON AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THEIR MEANING IS DERIVED FROMEACH OTHER. FOR INSTANCE, THE CHARACTERS FOR GOOD AND BAD ARE DIFFERENT.HOWEVER, WHEN COMBINED, THE WORD QUALITY IS FORMED. SO IN ORDER TO FORM THEWHOLE WORD QUALITY, HALF OF THE POSITIVE OF AND HALF OF THE NEGATIVE OF ISNECESSARY. THE CHARACTERS FOR LONG AND FOR SHORT TOGETHER (LONG/SHORT) MEAN THE“LENGTH” OF SOMETHING. THE CHARACTER FOR BUYING AND THAT FOR SELLING, WHENWRITTEN TOGETHER, FORM THE NEW WORD TRADE.THE SAME THING APPLIES TO THE MOVEMENTS IN GUNG FU, WHICH IS ALWAYS THECEASELESS INTERPLAY OF THE TWO FORCES OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS. THEY ARECONCEIVED OF AS ESSENTIALLY ONE, OR AS TWO COEXISTENT FORCES OF ONE INDIVISIBLEWHOLE. THEIR MEANING (GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS) IS DERIVED FROM EACH OTHER AND THEIRCOMPLETION THROUGH EACH OTHER.MANY TIMES I HAVE HEARD INSTRUCTORS FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS CLAIM THAT THEIRSYSTEMS OF GENTLENESS (YIN) REQUIRE ABSOLUTELY NO STRENGTH (STRENGTH HAS BECOMEAN UGLY WORD TO THEM), AND THAT WITH MERELY A FLICK OF ONE’S LITTLE FINGER, ONECAN SEND HIS THREE-HUNDRED-POUND HELPLESS OPPONENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. WEMUST FACE THE FACT THAT STRENGTH, THOUGH USED IN A MUCH MORE REFINED WAY, ISNECESSARY IN COMBAT, AND THAT AN AVERAGE OPPONENT DOESN’T CHARGE IN BLINDLY WITHHIS HEAD DOWN (NOT EVEN A FOOTBALL TACKIER WILL DO THIS!). HE, TOO, MIGHTPOSSESS SPEED AND SNAP AND SOME RUDIMENTARY KNOWLEDGE OF FIGHTING.SOME INSTRUCTORS, ON THE OTHER HAND, CLAIM THAT WITH THEIR “SUPER POWERFULSYSTEM” ONE CAN SMASH THROUGH ANY DEFENSE. ONCE AGAIN WE MUST REALIZE THAT APERSON DOES MOVE AND CHANGE JUST AS A BAMBOO THAT MOVES BACK AND FORTH IN ASTORM TO “DISSOLVE” THE STRONG WIND. SO NEITHER GENTLENESS (YIN) NOR FIRMNESS(YANG) HOLDS ANY MORE THAN ONE HALF OF A BROKEN WHOLE WHICH, FITTED TOGETHER,FORMS THE TRUE WAY OF GUNG FU. REMEMBER THAT IN ORDER TO GO SOMEWHERE, ONE CAN’TPUMP ON BOTH THE BICYCLE PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME OR NOT PUMP ON THEM AT ALL.GENTLENESS ALONE CAN’T FOREVER DISSOLVE AWAY GREAT FORCE, NOR CAN SHEER BRUTEFORCE FOREVER SUBDUE ONE’S FOE. IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN COMBAT, THE HARMONIOUSINTERFUSION OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS AS A WHOLE IS NECESSARY, SOMETIMES ONEDOMINATING AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER, IN A WAVE-LIKE SUCCESSION. THE MOVEMENT WILLTHEN TRULY FLOW; FOR THE TRUE FLUIDITY OF MOVEMENT IS IN ITS CHANGEABILITY.INSTEAD OF OPPOSING FORCE BY FORCE, A GUNG FU MAN COMPLETES HIS OPPONENT’SMOVEMENT BY ACCEPTING HIS FLOW OF ENERGY AS HE AIMS IT, AND DEFEATS HIM BYBORROWING HIS OWN FORCE. THIS, IN GUNG FU, IS KNOWN AS THE LAW OF ADAPTATION. INORDER TO RECONCILE ONESELF TO THE CHANGING MOVEMENTS OF THE OPPONENT, A GUNG FUMAN SHOULD FIRST OF ALL UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS.THERE IS NO DISLOCATION IN THE WAY OF GUNG FU MOVEMENT. THEY ARE DONE WITHFLOWING CONTINUITY LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF A RIVER THAT IS FOREVER FLOWING WITHOUTA MOMENT OF CESSATION OR STANDING STILL. AS SOON AS A MOVEMENT IS APPROXIMATELYFINISHED, IT IMMEDIATELY FLOWS INTO ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT STOPPING. THUS, DEFENSEAND ATTACK ARE ALTERNATELY PRODUCING ONE ANOTHER.FIRMNESS AND GENTLENESS IN THE CHINESE ART OF GUNG FU ARE NOT ISOLATED, BUTCOALESCENT, AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS SUCH AS ATTACK ANDDEFENSE, EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION, PUSHING AND PULLING, ETC.I’VE LEARNED A LOT FROM OBSERVING NATURE (SEE “A MOMENT OF UNDERSTANDING” INPART 3 OF THIS BOOK). SUCH THEORIES OF MOVEMENT AND UTILIZATION OF ENERGY AREBROUGHT ABOUT FROM THE REGULARITY OF THE TIDES AND FROM THE EFFECT OF THE WINDUPON BRANCHES OR GRASS. I’VE ESTABLISHED MY OWN POSTULATE ON THE UTILIZATION OFENERGY AND THE WAY OF MOVEMENTS OF GUNG FU. THE MOVEMENT OF GUNG FU IS LIKE THATOF A STRING OF PEARLS. THE PEARLS ARE THE TECHNIQUES USED AND THE STRING IS THELINKING OF EACH TECHNIQUE. THE UTILIZATION OF ENERGY AND MOVEMENT IN GUNG FUSHOULD FLOW ON CONTINUOUSLY WITHOUT CESSATION. THERE IS NO BROKEN OR INTERRUPTEDACTION. AS SOON AS A TECHNIQUE IS FINISHED, IT BEGINS TO MELT AND BLEND INTOANOTHER ONE. EXPANSION IS INTERDEPENDENT WITH CONTRACTION AND VICE VERSA.Image [../Images/35a.jpg]Image [../Images/35b.jpg]Image [../Images/35c.jpg]Image [../Images/36a.jpg]THE COMMON MISTAKE MOST PEOPLE MAKE IS THE PUNCHING OF ONE HAND WHILE PULLINGTHE OTHER ALL THE WAY BACK. I’VE GIVEN THIS MISTAKE A DESCRIPTION OF THE “BEADSWITHOUT THE STRING.” OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATIONS:Image [../Images/36b.jpg]THE “BEADS” IN THIS EXAMPLE ARE THE INDIVIDUAL TECHNIQUES, AND WITHOUT THESTRING TO LINK THEM, THEY ARE GOING TO FALL APART. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THEONENESS OF THESE MOVEMENTS OF NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE, THE GAP BETWEEN PUNCHINGAND PULLING SHOULD BE BRIDGED. WHEN PUNCHING, A LITTLE PULLING (BY ITSELF) ISIMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED, AND WHEN PULLING, A LITTLE PRESSING FORWARD IS CONCEALED.THE MISTAKES COMMITTED IN THE PREVIOUS SKETCHES ARE BASED ON PURE ADVANCING YANG(SHEER PUNCHING) AND PURE WITHDRAWING YIN (SHEER PULLING).Image [../Images/37a.jpg]ANY PRACTITIONER OF MARTIAL ART SHOULD THEREFORE CONSIDER BOTH THE SOFTNESS ANDFIRMNESS AS EQUALS IN IMPORTANCE AND UNAVOIDABLY INTERDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER.THE REJECTION OF EITHER GENTLENESS OR FIRMNESS WILL LEAD TO SEPARATION ANDSEPARATION RUNS TO EXTREME. UNDERSTAND THE FACT THAT FIRMNESS AND GENTLENESS ARENOT ISOLATED, BUT COALESCENT; THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY AS WELL AS CONTRASTIVE ANDIN THEIR INTERFUSION MAKE UP THE ONENESS. THE IDEA OF OPPOSITION RESULTS WHEN WESINGLE OUT FIRMNESS AND TREAT IT AS DISTINCT FROM GENTLENESS. TALL, FOR EXAMPLE,ONCE DISTINGUISHED, SUGGESTS ITS OPPOSITE: SHORT. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TODISTINGUISH TALLNESS, SHORTNESS IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMPARISON AND TALLNESSCANNOT EXIST WITHOUT SHORTNESS. FIRMNESS ACTUALLY IS GENTLENESS, AND GENTLENESSIS FIRMNESS, EACH IS THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER (THEY ARE ALTERNATELYPRODUCING ONE ANOTHER). ONE SHOULDN’T THEREFORE FAVOR TOO MUCH ON EITHERGENTLENESS OR FIRMNESS ALONE SO THAT HE CAN TRULY APPRECIATE THE “GOOD/BAD” OFTHEM. REMEMBER, GENTLENESS VERSUS FIRMNESS IS NOT THE SITUATION, BUTGENTLENESS/FIRMNESS AS A ONENESS IS THE TAO."},{"pageContent":"PART 2SOME TECHNIQUES OF GUNG FUImage [../Images/1b.jpg]THE FUNDAMENTALS OF GUNG FUTHE READY STANCETHE REQUIREMENTS OF THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY IN ASSUMING THE BY-JONG OR“READY STANCE” ARE AS FOLLOWS:1. THE HEAD: HOLD YOUR HEAD AS YOU WOULD NATURALLY, THAT IS, IT SHOULD BESTRAIGHT WITHOUT INCLINATION TO EITHER SIDE. YOU SHOULD HAVE A FEELING THAT THEHEAD IS PUSHING UPWARD. YOUR NECK MUSCLES SHOULD BE RELAXED WITHOUT TENSING.YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSION MUST BE NATURAL WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF EMOTION (IN OTHERWORDS, SIMPLY A STANDARD EXPRESSION). YOUR TONGUE MUST BE PRESSED AGAINST THEPALATE AND YOUR MOUTH NATURALLY CLOSED. THE POINT OF YOUR CHIN SHOULD BESLIGHTLY TUCKED IN. IF YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION, YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THEABOVE EFFORTLESSLY AND NATURALLY. REMEMBER—JUST BE NATURAL!Image [../Images/39a.jpg]2. THE TRUNK (CHEST AND BACK): ACCORDING TO THE OLD DOCTRINES OF THE INTERNALCLAN OF GUNG FU, THE CHEST MUST BE SUCKED IN AND THE BACK SLIGHTLY RAISED. THISALLOWS YOUR BREATHING TO GO DOWN TO THE ABDOMEN; NEVERTHELESS THE POSTURE DOESNOT SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD BE A HUNCHBACK. REMEMBER THAT ALL THIS MUST BE DONENATURALLY. THE CHEST MUSCLES MUST BE COMPLETELY RELAXED AND NOT TENSED SO THATTHE BREATHING WILL BE REGULATED.Image [../Images/40a.jpg]3. THE WAIST: THE WAIST IS THE MAIN SPRING OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY. THEMOVEMENTS OF THE LIMBS ARE SLOW AND SHORT, WHILE THOSE OF THE WAIST ARE FREE ANDLONG (WAIST—BIG AXIS, LIMBS—SMALL AXIS). REMEMBER THEREFORE THAT ONE TURNING OFA BIG AXIS IS EQUIVALENT TO HUNDREDS OF TURNINGS OF A SMALL AXIS. THE WAISTPLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART IN WALKING, RUNNING, STANDING, OR SITTING. IN GUNG FUTHE WAIST IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS IN CONNECTING THE MOVEMENTS OF THEUPPER AND LOWER BODY. DURING PRACTICE, WHETHER IN ADVANCING OR RETREATING, THEWAIST IS CONSCIOUSLY LOWERED DOWNWARD; NEVER TENSE IT UP BY ARCHING FORWARD ORBACKWARD SO THAT IT HINDERS THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS. ALL THESE MUST BE DONENATURALLY.4. THE HIP: THE HIP MUST NEVER STICK OUT DURING LOWERING OF THE BODY.5. THE LEGS: THE LEGS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN GUNG FU, AS THEY INVOLVE THE WHOLEBALANCE OF THE BODY. YOUR STEP SHOULD BE FIRM, YET LIGHT AND CAPABLE OFCHANGING. THE KNEE AND THE THIGH MUST BE RELAXED, WITH THE KNEE SLIGHTLY BENT.SEPARATE CLEARLY THE YIN AND YANG AMONG THE STEPS. YOUR BODY WEIGHT SHOULD BEDISTRIBUTED WITH 70 PERCENT OF THE WEIGHT RESTING ON THE REAR FOOT AND 30PERCENT RESTING ON THE LEAD FOOT. THIS WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION WILL ALLOW YOU FULLUSE OF THE FRONT LEG AS A COUNTER KICKING WEAPON.6. THE SHOULDERS AND ELBOWS: THE SHOULDERS AND ELBOWS SHOULD BE RELAXED ANDLOWERED. THE FINGERS OF THE LEAD HAND SHOULD BE POINTING FORWARD AND UP TOWARDTHE OPPONENT’S NOSE, WITH THE LEAD ARM BENT AT THE ELBOW AT A FORTY-FIVE-DEGREEANGLE. THE LEFT HAND SHOULD BE HELD PARALLEL TO THE RIGHT ELBOW WITH THE FINGERSPOINTING UP.THE CENTERLINE THEORYIMAGINE THAT YOUR BODY IS DIVIDED BY A LINE THAT RUNS FROM BETWEEN YOUR LEGSTHROUGH THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD. IN GUNG FU THIS IS CALLED JOAN SIEN, OR THECENTERLINE THEORY. IT IS THE BASE FROM WHICH ALL DEFENSE AND ATTACK AREDEPLOYED. YOU MUST ALWAYS HAVE YOUR CENTERLINE GUARDED WITH ONE OF YOUR HANDS ATALL TIMES, AND WHENEVER YOU CHANGE THE POSITION OF YOUR HANDS, REGARDLESS OFYOUR POSITION, YOU MUST ALWAYS ENDEAVOR TO PROTECT THE CENTERLINE.Image [../Images/41a.jpg]IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE IDEAL DISTANCE YOUR LEAD ELBOW SHOULD BE FROMTHE CENTERLINE IS THREE INCHES. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO EMPLOY THE IMMOVABLE-ELBOWTHEORY (SEE THE FOLLOWING SECTION), WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR ATTACK AND DEFENSEIN MANY STYLES OF GUNG FU.ADDITIONALLY, THE CENTERLINE THEORY ALLOWS YOU TO GENERATE MORE POWER IN YOURTECHNIQUES AS IT SERVES TO COORDINATE BOTH ARM AND BODY, ENABLING A GUNG FU MANTO EMPLOY HIS ENTIRE BODY WEIGHT WITH EACH STRIKE. USING ARM FORCE ALONE ISINDEED A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE UNTRAINED PERSON (IN FACT, A LOT OF INSTRUCTORSARE PRACTITIONERS OF THAT), AND SINCE STRIKING IS MAINLY USED IN GUNG FU, I’LLDISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP OF ARM POWER AND BODY POWER (WAIST OR HIP MOVEMENT) INLANDING A PUNCH. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE COMPREHENSION OF WHAT IS INVOLVED INCOMBINING THE WAIST WITH THE ARM, I’VE DIVIDED THE HUMAN BODY INTO TWO HALVESWITH AN IMAGINARY CENTERLINE AS IN FIGURE 1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1].Image [../Images/42a.jpg]Image [../Images/42b.jpg]FIGURE 2 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig2] SHOWS A PERSON RELEASING HIS RIGHT SIDE ANDPROPELLING HIS BODY WEIGHT (AS IN AN ORDINARY RIGHT-HAND PUNCH) BY BRACINGHIMSELF ON HIS LEFT FOOT, WHICH ACTS AS THE HINGE AROUND WHICH HIS RIGHT-SIDEBODY WEIGHT AND POWER ROTATES. THE HIP AND SHOULDERS ARE DRIVEN FIRST TO THEIMAGINARY CENTERLINE, THEN THE ARM COMES INTO PLAY “EXPLOSIVELY.” THE WHOLE IDEAIS TO TRANSFER THE WEIGHT—VIA YOUR STRIKE—TO THE OPPONENT’S TARGET AREA BEFORETHE WEIGHT TRANSFERS TO THE LEFT LEG. THAT IS ALSO WHY IN STEPPING IN TO STRIKE,THE LEADING FOOT SHOULD NOT LAND FIRST, OR THE BODY WEIGHT WILL REST UPON THEFLOOR INSTEAD OF BEING BEHIND THE STRIKING HAND. OF COURSE, ALL THESE ARECOORDINATED VERY, VERY FAST, BUT THE WAIST DOES COME A SPLIT SECOND FASTER.FROM THIS CENTERLINE I WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A NUCLEUS AND, LATER ON, ABLE TOJUMP AWAY FROM THE NUCLEUS AND ESTABLISH SUCH THINGS AS OUT-OF-LINE AND BROKENRHYTHM COUNTERATTACK. THUS, MY THEORY STATES:1. LEARN THE CENTER.2. KEEP THE CENTER.3. DISSOLVE THE CENTER.OR, IT CAN BE STATED MORE GENERALLY:1. LEARN THE RULES.2. KEEP TO THE RULES.3. DISSOLVE THE RULES.EMPHASIS MUST BE MADE TO STUDENTS OF GUNG FU TO STRIKE WITH THEIR ENTIRE BODYBEHIND THEIR TECHNIQUE BECAUSE, IN TERMS OF FORCE AND POWER, THE ARMS HAVE BUTONE QUARTER OF THE FORCE OF THE BODY WHEN SET IN MOTION. SECONDLY, THE MOVEMENTSOF THE WAIST ARE LONG AND FREE, WHILE THOSE OF THE ARMS ARE SHORT. YOU CAN SAYTHAT ONE TURNING OF A LARGE AXIS IS EQUIVALENT TO MANY TURNINGS OF A SMALL AXIS.ALSO, THE ARMS CAN ONLY EXERT THEIR MAXIMUM STRENGTH TOWARD THE END OF THEMOVEMENT—THEREFORE, THE ARMS ARE THE VEHICLE OF FORCE THAT IS RELEASED BY THEBODY THROUGH THIS CENTERLINE IDEA. BOXING ALSO MAKES USE OF THIS CENTERLINETHEORY BUT EXPRESSES IT IN TOO BIG A MOTION. IT IS ALL RIGHT AT FIRST, BUT LATERON IT SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY—TO EXPRESS THE UTMOST INTHE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTS AND ENERGY.THE IMMOVABLE-ELBOW THEORYIT IS IMPORTANT WHEN ASSUMING THE BY-JONG THAT THE ELBOW OF YOUR LEAD ARM REMAINIMMOVABLE. WITH YOUR ELBOW IN A FIXED POSITION APPROXIMATELY THREE INCHES INFRONT OF YOUR BODY, YOU’LL NOTE THAT YOUR HAND AND FOREARM ARE FREE TO MOVE INANY DIRECTION. IF YOU ENVISION A RECTANGLE THAT HAS BEEN STOOD ON ITS END, WITHITS BOTTOM BOUNDARY BEING YOUR GROIN AREA, ITS TOP BOUNDARY BEING YOUR EYEBROWS,AND ITS REMAINING TWO SIDES BEING EACH OF YOUR RESPECTIVE SHOULDERS, YOU WILLUNDERSTAND THE PARAMETERS OF MOVEMENT—UP AND DOWN AND SIDEWAYS—THAT YOUR ARMSCAN TRAVEL. FURTHER IMAGINE THAT THERE IS AN INVISIBLE PERPENDICULAR LINE THATINTERSECTS YOUR ELBOW. IF YOUR LEAD ARM IS PRESSED, HOLD TO THE CORE ORCENTERLINE. DO NOT GIVE IT UP, EVEN IF IT MEANS YOUR ENTIRE BODY MUST MOVE, ANDNEVER ALLOW YOUR ELBOW TO DIP BELOW YOUR NAVEL.Image [../Images/44a.jpg]IN GUNG FU, THE IMMOVABLE ELBOW IS CALLED BUT DOAN JIANG AND IS ONE OF THECORNERSTONES OF THE WING CHUN SYSTEM. IN THEORY, IT IS LIKENED TO A HURRICANE OFWHICH THE EYE IS ALWAYS STILL, BUT ITS PERIPHERY IS TREMENDOUSLY FORCEFUL ANDCONSTANTLY MOVING. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MOTIONLESS CENTER OF VORTICES APPEARS INMANIFESTATION AS MOTION, WHICH INCREASES IN VELOCITY IN THE MANNER OF AWHIRLPOOL OR TORNADO (WHOSE EPICENTER IS STILL) FROM NUCLEUS TO PERIPHERY. THENUCLEUS IS IN REALITY, WHEREAS THE VORTEX IS A PHENOMENON IN THE FORM OF AMULTIDIMENSIONAL FORCE FIELD.CONCENTRATE YOUR ENERGY AT THE IMMOVABLE INSTEAD OF DISPERSING IN SCATTEREDACTIVITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, HOLD TO THE CORE.THE FOUR GATESTHE IMMOVABLE-ELBOW POSITION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL PARRYING, DEFLECTING, ANDBLOCKING IN GUNG FU (PARTICULARLY IN THE ART OF WING CHUN). DEFENSE IN GUNG FUTAKES PLACE ALONG THE FOUR BOUNDARIES THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF THE FOUR CORNERPARRIES. THE FOUR CORNER PARRIES TAKE PLACE WITHIN THE FOUR PARAMETERS OF THERECTANGLE DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION ON THE IMMOVABLE ELBOW; THE GROIN AREA AT THEBOTTOM, THE EYEBROW AREA AT THE TOP, AND THE AREA JUST PAST THE SHOULDERS ONBOTH SIDES. THE CORNERS ARE DIVIDED INTO FOUR EQUAL REGIONS, OR GATES: THE TOPPORTION OF THE FORWARD-HAND SIDE (THE UPPER OUTSIDE GATE), THE TOP PORTION OFTHE REAR-HAND SIDE (THE UPPER INNER GATE), THE LOWER PORTION OF THE FORWARD-HANDSIDE (THE LOWER OUTSIDE GATE), AND THE LOWER PORTION OF THE REAR-HAND SIDE (THELOWER INNER GATE).Image [../Images/45a.jpg]THE EIGHT BASIC BLOCKING POSITIONS (FROM BY-JONG)ALL ATTACKS DIRECTED TOWARD EITHER OF THE OUTSIDE GATES (I.E., LOWER OR UPPEROUTSIDE GATE) ARE TO BE BLOCKED TO THE OUTSIDE, WHILE ALL ATTACKS DIRECTEDTOWARD EITHER OF THE INSIDE GATES (I.E., LOWER OR UPPER INSIDE GATE) ARE BLOCKEDINWARDLY. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A FORWARD AND REAR PORTION OF EACH GATE, WHICHARE TO BE GUARDED BY THE FORWARD AND REAR HANDS, RESPECTIVELY. THAT IS, IF APUNCH IS NOT DEFLECTED BY YOUR LEAD FOREARM AS IT COMES TOWARD YOU, BY THE TIMEIT REACHES YOUR CHEST AREA, YOUR REAR HAND SHOULD HAVE IT TAKEN CARE OF (WHETHERIT TRAVELS TO THE UPPER GATES OR THE LOWER GATES).Image [../Images/46a.jpg]Image [../Images/46b.jpg]Image [../Images/47a.jpg]Image [../Images/47b.jpg]Image [../Images/47c.jpg]Image [../Images/48a.jpg]ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ON THE FUNDAMENTALSTHE STRUCTURE OF THE WING CHUN GUNG FU SCHOOL(THE SIMPLICITY OF THE TRULY SOPHISTICATED)NOTE: ALL DIAGRAMS ARE IN THE READY POSITION (BY-JONG)Image [../Images/48b.jpg]THE SEVEN STARSIN GUNG FU, YOUR OPPONENT (ASSUMING HE IS UNARMED) HAS SEVEN “NATURAL” WEAPONS,CALLED “STARS” OR “PARTS” OF THE BODY, THAT CAN BE USED TO STRIKE YOU. THESESEVEN STARS ARE:1. HAND2. LEG3. ELBOW4. HEAD5. SHOULDER6. KNEE7. THIGHWATCH OUT FOR YOUR OPPONENT’S SEVEN STARS OR PARTS.THE THREE FRONTSYOUR OPPONENT’S SEVEN STARS CAN ONLY REACH YOU THROUGH THREE CHANNELS OF ATTACK.THESE CHANNELS OF ATTACK ARE CALLED THE “THREE GATES” OR THE “THREE FRONTS,”BECAUSE THEY ARE SITUATED DIRECTLY:1. IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES2. IN FRONT OF YOUR HANDS3. IN FRONT OF YOUR LEGSImage [../Images/49a.jpg]FOOTWORKWHEN IN COMBAT, ONE’S STANCE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY SHORTER (BUT NOT TOO SHORT, TOAVOID BEING PUSHED OFF BALANCE) IN ORDER TO KEEP THE LEADING LEG AND FOOT OUT OFRANGE OF A SUDDEN ATTACK. UNLESS THERE IS A TACTICAL REASON FOR ACTINGOTHERWISE, GAINING AND BREAKING OF GROUND IS EXECUTED BY MEANS OF SMALL ANDRAPID STEPS, AND ALL HAND MOVEMENTS (AS INDICATED IN THE SECTION ON THECENTERLINE THEORY) ARE TO BE COMBINED WITH WAIST AND FOOTWORK.PRACTICE SLIDING YOUR LEAD FOOT FORWARD IN TEN-INCH STEPS AND THEN IMMEDIATELYDRAG YOUR REAR FOOT UP AN EQUAL DISTANCE ONCE YOUR WEIGHT HAS SHIFTED TO THELEAD FOOT. CONVERSELY, AS A FURTHER AID TO MOBILITY, YOU SHOULD PRACTICESHIFTING YOUR WEIGHT BACK TO THE REAR FOOT AND THEN REPEAT THE PROCESS. CONTINUEON IN THIS MANNER UNTIL YOU DEVELOP PROFICIENCY IN YOUR MOBILITY. ONCE THIS ISACHIEVED, YOU CAN BEGIN TO USE THIS FOOTWORK IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, ALWAYSMAKING SURE THAT THE PLACEMENT OF YOUR LEAD FOOT IS DETERMINED BY THE DIRECTIONYOUR OPPONENT TURNS.THE WAY OF FACING (FOOTWORK)SINCE IT IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TO GUARD YOUR CENTERLINE WITH THEIMMOVABLE-ELBOW POSITION, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO KNOW HOW TO FACE YOUR OPPONENT(JIUE YING). WHEN YOU FACE YOUR OPPONENT, YOU ARE ABLE TO PRESERVE YOURCENTERLINE AND MAKE IT IMPERMEABLE. IF YOU DO NOT KEEP FACING YOUR OPPONENT(NOSE-TO-NOSE), YOU ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO YOUR OPPONENT’S ATTACK.Image [../Images/50a.jpg]Image [../Images/51a.jpg]THE FOUR RULES OF SUCCESSFUL FOOTWORKIN ORDER FOR YOUR MOVEMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND TO GAUGE THE FIGHTING DISTANCECORRECTLY, FOUR RULES MUST BE FOLLOWED:> 1. MAINTAIN TOTAL SENSITIVITY OF THE AURA.> > 2. BE TOTALLY ALIVE AND NATURAL IN YOUR MOTIONS.> > 3. MAINTAIN THE CORRECT DISTANCE BETWEEN YOURSELF AND YOUR OPPONENT.> > 4. MAINTAIN THE CORRECT PLACEMENT OF YOUR BODY.TRAINING TO ENHANCE FOOTWORKYOU CAN INCREASE YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR LEGS THROUGH MEDIUM-POSTURESQUATTING EXERCISES AND APE-IMITATION MOVEMENTS SUCH AS LOW WALKING. ALSOHELPFUL IN DEVELOPING BALANCE, MOBILITY, AND BODY FEEL ARE EXERCISES SUCH ASSKIPPING, RUNNING, SQUATTING (BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT WEIGHTS), AND ALTERNATE(I.E., STANDING) SPLITS. YOU SHOULD ALSO PRACTICE STEPPING TO BOTH SIDES ANDTHEIR VARIATIONS WHILE EMPLOYING YOUR KICKING TOOLS AND HAND TOOLS, ALL THEWHILE COVERING YOUR CENTERLINE AND HAND AND KNEE POSITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHENSIDE-STEPPING TO THE LEFT, YOUR RIGHT OR LEAD LEG SHOULD CROSS OVER IN FRONT OFYOUR REAR LEG, IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOUR GROIN AREA. THIS IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWEDBY A LATERAL STEP OF EQUAL DISTANCE BY THE REAR OR LEFT LEG SO THAT THE BY-JONGIS ONCE MORE ASSUMED. CONVERSELY, WHEN SIDE-STEPPING TO THE RIGHT, YOUR LEFT ORREAR LEG SHOULD CROSS BEHIND YOUR LEAD LEG TO BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY THELEAD LEG, THEREBY ALLOWING YOU TO REASSUME THE BY-JONG POSITION.THE BASIC STRIKING POINTS OF GUNG FUImage [../Images/53a.jpg]THERE IS ONLY ONE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DEFENSE: YOU MUST APPLY THE MOSTEFFECTIVE WEAPON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE POINT OF YOUR ENEMY.IN THIS CHAPTER YOU’LL FIND DIAGRAMS SHOWING THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONS GIVEN TOYOU BY NATURE AND THE MOST VULNERABLE POINTS OF THE BODY. PLEASE NOTE THAT ALLOF THESE MOVEMENTS ARE SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE USED ONLY WHENACTUALLY NECESSARY FOR SELF-DEFENSE.WEAPONS> A. USED AGAINST THE SOLAR PLEXUS.> > B. USED AGAINST THE JUNCTION OF THE NOSE AND FOREHEAD, OR BETWEEN THE UPPER> LIP AND THE INSIDE OF THE NECK.> > C. USED AGAINST THE BODY.> > D. USED AGAINST THE EYES.> > E. USED AGAINST THE SOLAR PLEXUS OR THE JAW.> > F. USED AGAINST THE TESTES.> > G. USED AGAINST THE CROTCH, ABDOMEN, OR TESTES.> > H. USED FROM PRONE POSITION AGAINST THE KNEE, CROTCH, ABDOMEN, JAW, OR CHIN.Image [../Images/54a.jpg]ANOTHER VIEW OF WEAPONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONSTHE FIRST HAND WEAPON TO LEARN TO USE EFFECTIVELY SHOULD BE THE STRAIGHT PUNCHWITH A VERTICAL FIST, THEN THE FINGER JAB, THEN THE PEACOCK EYE (ONE-KNUCKLEFIST), AND THE CHOP CHOY (FOUR-KNUCKLE FIST). NOTE: THE CHOP CHOY AND PEACOCKEYE ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE WHEN APPLIED AGAINST BONEY AREAS OR TARGETS LIKE EYES,THROAT, AND TEMPLE AREAS.THERE ARE VARIOUS KINDS OF STRIKES—IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU HIT AND WHAT WEAPONYOU WILL BE USING. TO THE EYES YOU WOULD USE FINGERS. AND THEN THERE IS THEBENT-ARM STRIKE, USING THE WAIST TO TURN IT INTO A BACK FIST WHICH CAN BEDEPLOYED EITHER HIGH (TO THE HEAD) OR LOW (TO THE GROIN). KICKS ARE EMPLOYED TOAREAS SUCH AS THE GROIN, KNEE, SHIN, OR INSTEP. ALTHOUGH I SAID AT THE OUTSETTHAT THERE IS ONLY ONE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DEFENSE, IT IS BETTER TO BREAK ITINTO SECTIONS AND LOOK AT IT MORE THOROUGHLY. THESE SECTIONS ARE:> 1. THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON> > 2. SPEED> > 3. THE POINT TO ATTACK OR COUNTERATTACKImage [../Images/55a.jpg]Image [../Images/55b.jpg]Image [../Images/56a.jpg]THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPONGIVEN A CHOICE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WEAPON, I WOULD ALWAYS CHOOSE THE LEG. ITIS LONGER THAN THE ARM AND CAN DEAL A HEAVIER BLOW, AND IT IS MUCH MOREPOWERFUL. SO, SHOULD ANYONE APPROACH YOU, YOUR KICK WOULD MAKE CONTACT BEFOREHIS PUNCH, IF BOTH COMMENCE AT THE SAME SPEED.Image [../Images/57a.jpg]Image [../Images/57b.jpg]SPEEDIN ALL BUT THE RAREST OF SITUATIONS THERE EXISTS NO TIME TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OFDEFENSE OR WEAPON TO USE. OBVIOUSLY, IF YOUR KICK DOES NOT COMMENCE, HIS PUNCHWILL LAND FIRST, AND YOUR DEFENSE IS USELESS. ONLY TRAINING CAN PRODUCE RESULTS(I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS). IF YOU DO NOT CONSIDER A FEW MINUTES OF TRAININGWORTHWHILE, AND THINK THE CHANCE OF ASSAULT IS SMALL, YOU ARE ONE OF THOSEPEOPLE WHO ENCOURAGES THUGS TO ATTACK, AND NO ONE CAN HELP YOU SHOULD ANEMERGENCY ARISE.Image [../Images/58a.jpg]THE POINT TO ATTACK OR COUNTERATTACKAMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POINTS FOR YOUR COUNTER IF ATTACKED BY A MAN ARE THEGROIN, EYES, ABDOMEN, AND KNEE.INTRODUCING THE WING CHUN STRAIGHT PUNCHImage [../Images/59a.jpg]THE ART OF STRAIGHT HITTING (PUNCHING IN A STRAIGHT AND DIRECT LINE) IS THEFOUNDATION OF SCIENTIFIC SKILL. IT IS THE END RESULT OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OFCAREFUL ANALYSIS AND THOUGHT. THE STRAIGHT PUNCH REQUIRES TREMENDOUS SPEED ANDINTELLIGENCE TO USE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT A STRAIGHT PUNCH HAS LESS DISTANCE TOTRAVEL EN ROUTE TO ITS TARGET THAN DO ROUND OR CIRCULAR ARM BLOWS (ALL OF THEABOVE ALSO APPLY TO KICKING AS WELL), WHICH MEANS THAT IT WILL ALWAYS REACH THEMARK BEFORE THESE OTHER STRIKES. IN ADDITION, THE STRAIGHT PUNCH USING AVERTICAL FIST (CH’UNG CHUIE) IS MORE ACCURATE THAN HOOKS AND SWINGS AND MAKESFULL USE OF THE ARM’S POTENTIAL REACH.Image [../Images/59b.jpg]IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO INITIATE THE STRAIGHT PUNCH FROM THE HIP, THE WAY OFDELIVERY OF MOST OTHER SCHOOLS OF MARTIAL ART. THIS WAY OF DELIVERY ISUNREALISTIC AND EXPOSES YOUR TORSO TOO MUCH UPON DELIVERY, IN ADDITION TO ADDINGTOO MUCH UNNECESSARY DISTANCE FOR THE PUNCH TO TRAVEL TOWARD YOUR OPPONENT.INSTEAD OF INITIATING FROM THE SHOULDER, THE PUNCH IS THROWN FROM THE CENTER OFTHE BODY, IN THE FORM OF A VERTICAL FIST (I.E., THUMB FACING UP), AND TRAVELS ONAN UPWARD ARC THAT PEAKS STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN NOSE. THE NOSE HERE ISTHE EXTENSION OF THE CENTERLINE OF YOUR TORSO. YOU CAN GENERATE EXTRA IMPACTPOWER BY KEEPING YOUR WRIST TURNED SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD DURING DELIVERY AND THENSTRAIGHTENING IT IMMEDIATELY UPON IMPACT TO ADD TORQUE OR A CORKSCREW EFFECT TOITS IMPACT.Image [../Images/60a.jpg]YOUR PUNCH SHOULD BE AIMED AT THE CENTER OF YOUR OPPONENT’S FACE. THE STRIKINGAREA OF THE PUNCH SHOULD BE THE LAST OR BOTTOM THREE KNUCKLES OF THE FIST, ANDYOU SHOULD BE DROPPING YOUR BODY WEIGHT BEHIND EACH PUNCH.THE PUNCH SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DELIVERED AT A MOMENT’S NOTICE AND AT ANY RANGE(AGAIN, DO NOT START IT FROM THE WAIST) AND SHOULD END WITH A SNAP. IT SHOULDSTART OFF WITH SPEED BUT WITH NO ENERGY OR FORCE, AND CONCENTRATE ALL OF YOURENERGY AT THE POINT OF IMPACT.DO NOT USE ONLY ARM POWER IN STRIKING, BUT STRIKE WITH CORRECT TIMING, FOOTWORK,PLUS WAIST MOTION AND MENTAL AIMING. THIS MENTAL AIMING IS TO AIM TWO INCHESFURTHER OR ANY PART OF THE BODY TO BE STRUCK. WHEN STEPPING FORWARD TO HIT, DONOT LET YOUR FOOT LAND FIRST SO THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE BEHIND THE STRIKINGHAND.Image [../Images/61a.jpg]DO NOT DROP THE OTHER HAND WHEN STRIKING; FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE RIGHT HAND HITSHIGH, THE LEFT SHOULD BE BELOW THE RIGHT ELBOW FOR PROTECTION. IN THE SAME WAYWHEN THE LEFT HAND HITS LOW, THE RIGHT HAND SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF THE CHEST.Image [../Images/61b.jpg]RELAXATION AND FOLLOW-THROUGHRELAXATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR FASTER AND MORE POWERFUL PUNCHING. LET YOUR STRAIGHTPUNCH SHOOT OUT LOOSELY AND EASILY, DO NOT TIGHTEN UP OR CLENCH THE FIST OF YOURPUNCHING HAND UNTIL THE MOMENT OF IMPACT. ALL PUNCHES SHOULD END WITH A SNAP“SEVERAL INCHES BEHIND THE TARGET.” THUS YOU PUNCH THROUGH THE OPPONENT INSTEADOF AT HIM.THE ADVANTAGES OF THE LEAD PUNCH (A SUMMARY)> 1. FASTER—THE SHORTEST DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS A STRAIGHT LINE.> > 2. MORE ACCURATE—“CHOOSES THE STRAIGHTEST COURSE.” THUS LESS CHANCE OF MISSING> AND IS SURER THAN OTHER PUNCHES.> > 3. BALANCE IS LESS DISTRIBUTED—SAFER.> > 4. LESS INJURIOUS TO ONE’S HAND.> > 5. GREATER FREQUENCY OF HITS—MORE DAMAGE CAN BE DONE.> > 6. REDUCES THE CHANCES OF MISSING BECAUSE OPPONENT HAS LESS TIME FOR BLOCKING.REGULAR STRAIGHT PUNCH VERSUS GUNG FU STRAIGHT PUNCHImage [../Images/62a.jpg]THE STRAIGHT PUNCH IS THE FASTEST, MOST ACCURATE PUNCH IN GUNG FU. NOTE HOW ITPROCEEDS FROM B TO A IN A STRAIGHT LINE, WITH NO WASTED MOTION, UNLIKE A’S CURVELINE PUNCH TO B.SOME ADDITIONAL GUNG FU HAND STRIKESImage [../Images/62b.jpg]Image [../Images/63a.jpg]Image [../Images/63b.jpg]Image [../Images/63c.jpg]Image [../Images/63d.jpg]Image [../Images/64a.jpg]FACING OPPONENT B IN READY (BY-JONG) POSITION.Image [../Images/64b.jpg]STILL TRAPPING B'S LEAD HAND WITH HIS LEFT HAND, A STRIKES B'S THROAT WITH ABACK FAN-PALM STRIKE.Image [../Images/64c.jpg]A SLAPS B'S HAND OUT OF THE CENTERLINE TO OPEN A DIRECT PATH TO B’S THROATImage [../Images/64d.jpg]A BACKFIST COULD ALSO BE EMPLOYED INSTEAD OF A BACK FAN-PALM STRIKE, RESULTINGIN EQUAL SUCCESS.Image [../Images/64e.jpg]THE STRAIGHT BLASTTHE STRAIGHT PUNCH, WHEN THROWN IN ALTERNATING FASHION FOR SEVERAL SERIES, ISCALLED THE STRAIGHT BLAST. I CONSIDER THIS FORM OF MULTIPLE STRAIGHT PUNCHINGTHE HEART OF SUCCESSFUL CLOSE-RANGE ATTACK. JUST LIKE THE STRAIGHT PUNCH, ALLPUNCHES SHOULD BE THROWN IN LONG, OVAL PATTERNS AND GROUPED TOGETHER IN QUICKSUCCESSION. THIS WILL FORCE YOUR OPPONENT INTO A DEFENSIVE POSTURE, THUS TAKINGHIM OUT OF ATTACK MODE AND ALSO EXPOSE HIS CENTERLINE IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING AFORM OF OFFENSIVE BLOCKING/PARRYING AGAINST IN-COMING PUNCHES. IN SHORT, THESTRAIGHT BLAST IS A VALUABLE TECHNIQUE TO LEARN BECAUSE IT IS EASY TO DEVELOP,EASY TO COMBINE WITH OTHER TECHNIQUES (SUCH AS A FINGER JAB, BACK FIST, OR SHINKICK), AND VERY HARD TO DEFEND AGAINST AS MOST PEOPLE ARE INEXPERIENCED INDEFENDING THEIR CENTERLINE AREA.BLOCKING/STRIKING TECHNIQUESI HAVE SAID BEFORE THAT INSTEAD OF OPPOSING FORCE WITH FORCE, A GUNG FU MANCOMPLETES HIS OPPONENT’S MOVEMENT BY ACCEPTING HIS FLOW OF ENERGY AS HE AIMS IT,AND DEFEATS HIM BY BORROWING HIS OWN FORCE. IN ORDER TO RECONCILE ONESELF TO THECHANGING MOVEMENTS OF THE OPPONENT, A GUNG FU MAN SHOULD FIRST OF ALL UNDERSTANDTHE TRUE MEANING OF THE YIN AND THE YANG—THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF GUNG FU.THOSE WHO VIEW BLOCKING AND STRIKING AS TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES DO NOT FULLYCOMPREHEND THE REALITY OF YIN/YANG. THIS IS THE FAULT OF PURE STRIKING (YANG)AND PURE WITHDRAWING (YIN), WHICH CAN BE ILLUSTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING SYMBOL:Image [../Images/66a.jpg]IT IS LIKE A STRING OF BEADS WITHOUT THE STRING TO LINK THEM TOGETHER. IN ORDERTO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN STRIKING AND BLOCKING, THE INTERFUSION OF THE TWO AS AWHOLE IS NECESSARY. THUS, THE ABOVE SYMBOL SHOULD BE CHANGED TO THE SYMBOL OFYIN/YANG:Image [../Images/66b.jpg]THE RECEPTIVE (YIN) IS THE PERFECT COMPLEMENTARY OF FIRMNESS (YANG); IT DOESN’TCOMBAT STRENGTH BUT COMPLETES IT.BE SOFT, YET NOT YIELDING; FIRM, YET NOT HARD.REMEMBER THAT FIRMNESS IS BROUGHT TO LIFE BY GENTLENESS AND GENTLENESS ISACTIVATED AND LED BY FIRMNESS.TO BE BENT IS TO BE STRAIGHT.Image [../Images/67a.jpg]TRUE GENTLENESS IS LIKE A PLIABLE REED IN THE WIND; IT NEITHER OPPOSES NOR GIVESWAY. THE GENTLENESS ACCOMMODATES ITSELF TO THE STRENGTH OF THE FIRMNESS TO MAKEIT ITS OWN. THERE IS NEITHER PURPOSE NOR EFFORT IN RECEPTIVENESS; THE OPPONENT’STECHNIQUES ARE YOUR TECHNIQUES.GENTLENESS OPENS WHEN IT MOVES AND CLOSES WHEN AT REST.YIELDING OVERCOMES ANYTHING STRONGER THAN ITSELF; ITS STRENGTH IS BOUNDLESS.THEREFORE, FOLLOW TILL THE MOMENT WHEN THE OPPOSING FORCE REACHES ITS LIMIT ANDBEGINS TO DECLINE.WHAT IS ADAPTATION? IT IS LIKE THE IMMEDIACY OF THE SHADOW ADJUSTING ITSELF TOTHE MOVING BODY. WHAT IS THE HIGHEST STATE OF YIELDING? IT IS LIKE CLUTCHINGWATER. WHAT IS GENTLENESS? IT IS LIKE A SPRING; IF ONE PRESSES IT DOWN, IT ONLYSPRINGS UP HIGHER. WHAT IS TRUE STILLNESS? STILLNESS IN MOVEMENT. WHAT IS THEPURPOSE OF FIRMNESS AND GENTLENESS? THE PURPOSE OF FIRMNESS IS TO KEEP ONE FROMGETTING TOO LAX, WHILE THE PURPOSE OF GENTLENESS IS TO KEEP ONE FROM GETTING TOOHARD. NOTHING CAN SURVIVE LONG BY GOING TO EXTREMES.THERE IS NO DISLOCATION IN THE WAY OF GUNG FU MOVEMENT. THE TECHNIQUES ARE DONEWITH FLOWING CONTINUITY LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF A RIVER THAT IS FOREVER FLOWINGWITHOUT A MOMENT OF CESSATION OR STANDING STILL. AS SOON AS ONE MOVEMENT ISCOMPLETED, IT IMMEDIATELY FLOWS INTO ANOTHER ONE WITHOUT STOPPING. THUS DEFENSEAND ATTACK ARE ALTERNATELY PRODUCING ONE ANOTHER.“TO DEFEND IS TO ATTACK, AND TO ATTACK IS TO DEFEND” IS, INDEED, BECOMING ACHEAP STATEMENT UTTERED BY ALL SELF-DEFENSE INSTRUCTORS. HERE LET US LOOK INTOTHE REAL MEANING OF THIS STATEMENT BY SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF SIMULTANEOUSATTACK/DEFENSE.Image [../Images/68a.jpg]YOU’LL NOTE THAT DURING STRIKING, BLOCKING IS CONCEALED AND DURING BLOCKING,STRIKING IS CONCEALED (YIN/YANG).Image [../Images/68b.jpg]POSITION—OPPONENTS STAND FACING EACH OTHER.ACTION—OPPONENT ATTEMPTS A BLOW TO THE FACE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND. AS THE BLOWCOMES, QUICKLY USE YOUR LEFT HAND AND PUSH OPPONENT’S HAND ASIDE. AT THE SAMETIME, YOUR RIGHT FIST MUST COME OUT AT ONCE AND HIT YOUR OPPONENT'S FACE.Image [../Images/69a.jpg]POSITION—OPPONENTS STAND FACING EACH OTHER.ACTION—OPPONENT INTENDS TO HIT YOU ON THE HYPOCHONDRIUM WITH HIS RIGHT HAND.QUICKLY USE YOUR LEFT HAND TO STOP HIS BLOW COMING. AT THE SAME TIME, HIT HIM INTHE SOLAR PLEXUS. USUALLY, WHEN HE GETS IT, HE WILL TURN TO THE LEFT AND TRY TOHIT YOU WITH HIS LEFT HAND. HIT HIM AGAIN, AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED.Image [../Images/69b.jpg]POSITION—OPPONENTS STAND FACING EACH OTHER.ACTION—OPPONENT HITS YOU ON YOUR FACE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND. YOU THEN QUICKLY MOVEYOUR RIGHT HAND AND GRASP HIS RIGHT ARM. AT THE SAME TIME, USE YOUR LEFT FISTAND HIT HIM ON THE TEMPLE.Image [../Images/69c.jpg]POSITION—OPPONENTS STAND FACING EACH OTHER.ACTION—OPPONENT ATTEMPTS TO ATTACK YOU IN THE FACE WITH HIS RIGHT FIST. QUICKLYMOVE YOUR LEFT HAND UPWARD AND STOP THE BLOW. THEN HIT STRAIGHT ON HIS CHESTWITH YOUR PALM.NOTE: ALL THESE ACTIONS MUST BE DONE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.Image [../Images/69d.jpg]POSITION—OPPONENTS STAND FACING EACH OTHER.ACTION—YOU INTEND TO ATTACK YOUR OPPONENT'S FACE WITH YOUR LEFT HAND, BUT HE ISTOO CLEVER FOR YOU. HE DEFENDS HIMSELF BY BRINGING HIS RIGHT HAND UPWARD ANDSTOPS YOUR BLOW FROM COMING. WHEN HIS HAND TOUCHES YOU, HOWEVER, YOU MUSTQUICKLY GO DOWNWARD AND HIT HIM ON THE RIB OR BELLY.Image [../Images/70a.jpg]FIGURE 1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1d].

ALL OF THE ABOVE MOVEMENTS MOVE IN ONE UNIT THE MOMENT BFEELS THE JERKING AND RELAXATION OF A’S RIGHT SHOULDER AND ARM.CLOSE-RANGE GUNG FU—THE STICKING HANDS METHOD OF WING CHUNImage [../Images/72a.jpg]CHI SAO, THE SO-CALLED ART OF STICKING HANDS, IS A UNIQUE METHOD OF TRAININGFROM THE WING CHUN STYLE, A SOUTHERN CHINESE STYLE, HEADED BY MR. YIP MAN OFHONG KONG. IT WAS ACTUALLY FROM MR. YIP THAT I TOOK UP THE STYLE OF WING CHUN.LET ME PREFACE WHAT I’M ABOUT TO SHARE WITH YOU ON THIS UNIQUE METHOD OFCULTIVATING SENSITIVITY IN ONE’S ARMS BY STATING THAT IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLETO LEARN PROPER CHI SAO FROM A BOOK.TO LEARN CHI SAO PROPERLY REQUIRES AN EXPERT INSTRUCTOR WHO GUIDES HIS STUDENTSTEP BY STEP AND FEEDS HIM THE RIGHT FLOW. IN THE HANDS OF A NOVICE, CHI SAO CANTURN INTO A JERKY WRESTLING MATCH. SUCH STRENUOUS PRACTICE WILL NOT ONLY HINDERUNDERSTANDING, BUT WILL LEAD TO INSTANT COUNTERING BY A SHARP OPPONENT.CHI SAO IS A FLOWING ENERGY EXERCISE IN WHICH WE ATTACH OUR HANDS TO THEOPPONENT’S HANDS AND FORGET OURSELVES BY FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS HANDS,LEAVING OUR MIND FREE TO MAKE ITS OWN COUNTER-MOVEMENT WITHOUT DELIBERATION.WHEN THE OPPONENT EXPANDS, WE CONTRACT; WHEN HE CONTRACTS, WE EXPAND—TO FIT OURMOVEMENTS HARMONIOUSLY INTO HIS ATTACK WITHOUT ANTICIPATING OR RUSHING THEACTION, BUT SIMPLY CONTINUING THE FLOW. FLOWING ENERGY PROPERLY THROUGH YOURHANDS IS LIKE WATER FLOWING THROUGH A HOSE. IF THE WATER IS TURNED ON AND OFFQUICKLY, THE HOSE WILL JERK. INSTEAD, OUR DEFENSE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS ATTACKWITHOUT A MOMENT’S INTERRUPTION, SO THAT THERE WILL BE NO TWO SEPARATE MOVEMENTSTO BE KNOWN AS “ATTACK” AND “DEFENSE.” THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO ATTEMPT TOCONTROL THE ATTACK BY RESISTING IT WITH FORCE (EITHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL), BUTRATHER TO CONTROL IT BY GOING WITH IT, THUS NOT ASSERTING ONESELF AGAINSTNATURE. ALL THESE ARE SIMPLY BASED ON THE HARMONIOUS INTERCHANGING OF THE THEORYOF YIN/YANG. AS LONG AS WE PLAN OUR ACTIONS, WE ARE STILL USING STRENGTH ANDWILL NOT BE ABLE TO FEEL OUR OPPONENT’S MOVEMENTS, THUS FAILING TO COMPREHENDTHE TRUE APPLICATION OF YIN AND YANG.IN THE WING CHUN STYLE, CHI SAO HAS BOTH THE ONE-HANDED AND THE TWO-HANDEDPRACTICE. BY ROLLING THEIR HANDS IN HARMONY, AS WELL AS IN CONTRAST, THEPRACTITIONERS CULTIVATE THE FLOWING ENERGY. THE PRACTITIONER SHOULD KEEP THEFLOW CONSTANT AND FILL EVERY POSSIBLE GAP IN EACH ROLLING AND TURNING. ASTRAINING GOES ON, THE MORE THIS ENERGY BECOMES LIKE WATER, AND THE NARROWER THECRACK THROUGH WHICH ITS FLOW CAN PASS.FROM THE POSITIONS IN CHI SAO, EACH PRACTITIONER TRIES TO SCORE SQUARELY ON ONEANOTHER. WITH THE FLOWING ENERGY, THE DEFENDER “FLOATS” AND “DISSOLVES” THEOPPONENT’S FORCE, LIKE A BOAT TOSSING SAFELY AMONG THE TURBULENT WAVES, SO AS TOBORROW THE ATTACKER’S FORCE TO COMPLETE HIS COUNTER. IN VIEW OF THIS, THE TWOPRACTITIONERS ARE ACTUALLY TWO HALVES OF ONE WHOLE.EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF ONE-HAND POSITIONS, ALL THE OTHERS IN CHI SAO ARE ELBOWSIN. THIS ELBOW-IN POSITION IS IMPORTANT IN WING CHUN AS IT ACTS AS A DEFLECTING,AUXILIARY FORCE SHOULD THE WRIST FAIL TO DETECT THE SUDDEN INCREASE OF PRESSUREFROM THE OPPONENT’S ATTACK. AS MENTIONED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK, THE ELBOWSHOULD BE THE IMMOVABLE CENTER, WHILE THE FOREARM AND HAND ARE PLIABLE IN THEIRADAPTATIONS AND CHANGES. SO, THE HANDS IN CHI SAO SHOULD BE SOFT BUT NOTYIELDING; FORCEFUL AND FIRM, BUT NOT HARD OR RIGID.Image [../Images/74a.jpg]OFFENSIVELY, WING CHUN’S CHI SAO UTILIZES MAINLY STRAIGHT, FORWARD ENERGY;DEFENSIVELY, IT MAKES USE OF A DEFLECTING ARC AS WELL AS STRAIGHT PENETRATIVELINES. THE PRACTITIONER OF THE WING CHUN STYLE KEEPS TO THE NUCLEUS, LETTING HISOPPONENT MOVE AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE. HE ALSO LEARNS TO MOVE STRAIGHT FROM THECENTER OUT, OR “JUST ENOUGH” FROM THE OUTSIDE IN, WITH HIS CENTERLINE WELLGUARDED BY THE ELBOW.THE MOTION AND UTILIZATION OF ENERGY IN CHI SAO IS LIKE THAT OF A STREAM THAT ISFOREVER FLOWING WITHOUT A MOMENT OF CESSATION OR STANDING STILL. THE “CLINGINGSTAGE” MEANS “THE MIND STOPS TO ABIDE”—WHERE IT ATTACHES ITSELF TO ANY OBJECT ITENCOUNTERS. INSTEAD OF FLOWING FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER, THE MIND STOPS WITHONE.IN CHI SAO YOU SIMPLY FEEL AND PERCEIVE THE OPPONENT’S MOVE; YOU DO NOT ALLOWYOUR MIND TO STOP WITH IT; YOU MOVE ON JUST AS YOU ARE TOWARD THE OPPONENT ANDMAKE USE OF HIS ATTACK BY TURNING IT ON TO HIMSELF. AS SOON AS YOUR MIND STOPSWITH AN OBJECT OF WHATEVER NATURE—BE IT THE OPPONENT’S TECHNIQUE OR YOUR OWN,THE MODE OR THE MEASURE OF THE MOVE—YOU CEASE TO BE MASTER OF YOURSELF AND ARESURE TO FALL VICTIM TO YOUR OPPONENT. WHEN YOU SET YOURSELF AGAINST HIM, YOURMIND WILL BE CARRIED AWAY BY HIM. THEREFORE, DO NOT THINK OF VICTORY OR EVEN OFYOURSELF (UNDERSTAND THE YIN AND YANG AS COMPLEMENTARY INSTEAD OF ASOPPOSITION).KWAN YIN, THE GODDESS OF MERCY, IS SOMETIMES REPRESENTED WITH 1,000 ARMS, EACHHOLDING A DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT. IF HER MIND STOPS WITH THE USE, FOR INSTANCE, OFA SWORD, ALL THE OTHER ARMS, 999 IN NUMBER, WILL BE OF NO USE WHATEVER. IT ISONLY BECAUSE HER MIND DOESN’T STOP WITH THE USE OF ONE ARM BUT MOVES FROM ONEINSTRUMENT TO ANOTHER THAT ALL HER ARMS PROVE USEFUL WITH THE UTMOST DEGREE OFEFFICIENCY.FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I LOOK AT A TREE, I PERCEIVE ONE OF THE LEAVES IS RED, AND MYMIND STOPS WITH THIS LEAF. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, I SEE ONLY ONE LEAF AND FAIL TOTAKE NOTICE OF THE INNUMERABLE OTHER LEAVES OF THE TREE. IF, INSTEAD OFRESTRICTING MY ATTENTION TO ONE, I LOOK AT THE TREE WITHOUT ANY PRECONCEIVEDIDEAS, I SHALL SEE ALL THE LEAVES. ONE LEAF EFFECTIVELY STOPS MY MIND FROMSEEING ALL THE REST. BUT WHEN THE MIND MOVES ON WITHOUT STOPPING, IT TAKES UPHUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LEAVES WITHOUT FAIL.THEREFORE, AS SOON AS THERE IS A MOMENT’S STOPPAGE YOUR MIND IS NO LONGER YOUROWN, FOR IT IS THEN PLACED UNDER ANOTHER’S CONTROL. WHEN THE MIND CALCULATES SOAS TO BE QUICK IN MOVEMENT, THE VERY THOUGHT MAKES THE MIND CAPTIVE. WHEN THEULTIMATE PERFECTION IS ATTAINED IN CHI SAO, THE BODY AND LIMBS PERFORM BYTHEMSELVES WHAT IS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO DO WITH NO INTERFERENCE FROM THE MIND.THE TECHNICAL SKILL IS SO AUTOMATIZED IT IS COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM CONSCIOUSEFFORT.THE NEXT PROBLEM IS WHERE TO KEEP THE MIND DURING SPARRING (I.E., CHI-SAOPRACTICE). WHEN THE MIND IS DIRECTED TO THE MOVEMENTS OF THE OPPONENT, IT ISTAKEN UP BY THEM. WHEN IT IS DIRECTED TO KNOCK DOWN THE OPPONENT, IT IS TAKEN UPBY THE IDEA OF STRIKING. WHEN IT IS DIRECTED TO DEFENDING YOURSELF, IT IS TAKENUP BY THE IDEA OF DEFENSE.SOME MARTIAL ARTISTS SUGGEST TO KEEP THE MIND IN THE LOWER PART OF THE ABDOMENJUST BELOW THE NAVEL, AND THIS WILL ENABLE ONE TO ADJUST ONESELF IN ACCORDANCEWITH THE SHIFTING OF THE SITUATION FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT. THIS IS REASONABLEENOUGH, AND WHILE BEING TRAINED, THE KEEPING OF THE MIND IN THE LOWER REGION OFTHE ABDOMEN MAY NOT BE A BAD IDEA. BUT IT IS STILL THE STAGE OF REVERENCE. AFTERALL, IF YOU TRY TO KEEP THE MIND IMPRISONED IN THE LOWER REGION OF THE ABDOMEN,THE VERY IDEA OF KEEPING IT IN ONE SPECIFIED LOCALITY WILL PREVENT THE MIND FROMOPERATING ANYWHERE ELSE, AND THE RESULT WILL BE THE CONTRARY TO WHAT HAD BEENINTENDED.WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND IN THE RIGHT HAND, IT WILL BE KEPT CAPTIVE IN THE RIGHTHAND, AND THE REST OF THE BODY WILL BE FOUND INCONVENIENCED. THE RESULT WILL BETHE SAME WHEN YOU PUT IT IN THE LEFT HAND OR IN THE LEG OR IN ANY OTHERPARTICULAR PART OF THE BODY, BECAUSE THEN THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE BODY WILLFEEL ITS ABSENCE. THE THING IS NOT TO TRY TO LOCALIZE THE MIND ANYWHERE BUT TOLET IF FILL UP THE WHOLE BODY, LET IT FLOW THROUGHOUT THE TOTALITY OF YOURBEING. WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU USE THE HANDS WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED, AND NO TIME ORNO EXTRA ENERGY WILL BE WASTED. (THE LOCALIZATION OF THE MIND MEANS IT ISFREEZING. WHEN IT CEASES TO FLOW FREELY AS IT IS NEEDED, IT IS NO MORE THE MINDIN ITS SUCHNESS.)WHEN THE MIND FILLS UP THE BODY ENTIRELY, IT IS SAID TO BE RIGHT; WHEN IT ISLOCATED IN ANY SPECIAL PART OF THE BODY, IT IS PARTIAL OR ONESIDED. CHI SAODISLIKES PARTIALIZATION OR LOCALIZATION. WHEN THE MIND IS NOT PARTIALIZED AFTERSCHEMATIZED PLAN, IT NATURALLY DIFFUSES ITSELF ALL OVER THE BODY. IT THUS CANMEET THE OPPONENT AS HE MOVES ABOUT—TRYING TO STRIKE YOU DOWN. WHEN YOUR HANDSARE NEEDED THEY ARE THERE TO RESPOND TO YOUR ORDER. SO WITH THE LEGS—AS THEY ARENEEDED. THE MIND NEVER FAILS TO OPERATE THEM ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION. THEREIS NO NEED FOR THE MIND TO MANEUVER ITSELF OUT FROM ANY LOCALIZED QUARTER (FOREXAMPLE, LOWER ABDOMEN) WHERE IT HAS BEEN PREARRANGED FOR IT TO STATION ITSELF.DO NOT LOCALIZE YOUR ATTENTIONNOT TO LOCALIZE OR PARTIALIZE THE MIND IS THE END OF SPIRITUAL TRAINING. WHEN ITIS NOWHERE IT IS EVERYWHERE. WHEN IT OCCUPIES ONE TENTH, IT IS ABSENT IN THEOTHER NINE TENTHS. LET THE GUNG FU MAN DISCIPLINE HIMSELF TO HAVE THE MIND GO ONITS OWN WAY, INSTEAD OF TRYING DELIBERATELY TO CONFINE IT SOMEWHERE. THEREFORE,DURING CHI SAO, YOU SHOULD HAVE NOTHING PURPOSELY DESIGNED, NOTHING CONSCIOUSLYCALCULATED, NO ANTICIPATION, NO EXPECTATION. IN SHORT, YOU SHOULD BE STANDINGTHERE LIKE A DEAD MAN. TO BE CONSCIOUS IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE HUMAN MIND ASDISTINGUISHED FROM THE MIND OF THE LOWER ANIMALS. BUT WHEN THE MIND BECOMESCONSCIOUS OF ITS DOINGS, IT CEASES TO BE INSTINCTUAL AND ITS COMMANDS ARECOLORED WITH CALCULATIONS AND DELIBERATIONS—WHICH MEANS THAT THE CONNECTIONBETWEEN ITSELF AND THE LIMBS IS NO LONGER DIRECT BECAUSE THE IDENTITY OF THECOMMANDER AND HIS EXECUTIVE AGENT IS LOST. WHEN DUALISM (YANG AGAINST YANG)TAKES PLACE, THE WHOLE PERSONALITY NEVER COMES OUT AS IT IS IN ITSELF (LETTINGGO ITSELF FROM ITSELF).THE EMPTY-MINDEDNESS OF CHI SAO APPLIES TO ALL ACTIVITIES WE MAY PERFORM, SUCHAS DANCING. IF THE DANCER HAS ANY IDEA AT ALL OF DISPLAYING HIS ART WELL, HECEASES TO BE A GOOD DANCER, FOR HIS MIND STOPS WITH EVERY MOVEMENT HE GOESTHROUGH. IN ALL THINGS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FORGET YOUR MIND AND BECOME ONE WITHTHE WORK AT HAND. WHEN THE MIND IS TIED UP, IT FEELS INHIBITED IN EVERY MOVE ITMAKES AND NOTHING WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH ANY SENSE OF SPONTANEITY. THE WHEELREVOLVES WHEN IT IS NOT TOO TIGHTLY ATTACHED TO THE AXLE. WHEN IT IS TOO TIGHT,IT WILL NEVER MOVE ON. AS THE ZEN SAYING GOES: “INTO A SOUL ABSOLUTELY FREE FROMTHOUGHTS AND EMOTION, EVEN THE TIGER FINDS NO ROOM TO INSERT ITS FIERCE CLAWS.”IN CHI SAO THE MIND IS DEVOID OF ALL FEAR, INFERIORITY COMPLEXES, VISCOUSFEELING, ETC., AND IS FREE FROM ALL FORMS OF ATTACHMENT, AND IT IS MASTER OFITSELF, IT KNOWS NO HINDRANCES, NO INHIBITIONS, NO STOPPAGES, NO CLOGGING, NOSTICKINESS. IT THEN FOLLOWS ITS OWN COURSE LIKE WATER; IT IS LIKE THE WIND THATBLOWS WHERE IT LISTS.IN THE BEGINNING, ONE NATURALLY ENDEAVORS TO DO HIS BEST IN GUNG FU, AS INLEARNING ANY OTHER ART. THE TECHNIQUE HAS TO BE MASTERED. BUT AS SOON AS HISMIND IS FIXED ON ANYTHING, FOR INSTANCE IF HE DESIRES TO DO WELL, OR TO DISPLAYHIS SKILL, OR TO EXCEL OTHERS, OR IF HE IS TOO ANXIOUSLY BENT ON MASTERING HISART, HE IS SURE TO COMMIT MORE MISTAKES THAN ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY. WHY?BECAUSE HIS SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS OR EGO-CONSCIOUSNESS IS TOO CONSPICUOUSLY PRESENTOVER THE ENTIRE RANGE OF HIS ATTENTION—WHICH FACT INTERFERES WITH A FREE DISPLAYOF WHATEVER PROFICIENCY HE HAS SO FAR ACQUIRED OR IS GOING TO ACQUIRE. HE SHOULDGET RID OF THIS OBTRUDING SELF—OR EGO-CONSCIOUSNESS—AND APPLY HIMSELF TO THEWORK TO BE DONE AS IF NOTHING PARTICULAR WERE TAKING PLACE AT THE MOMENT. HESHOULD AVOID:> 1. THE DESIRE FOR VICTORY> > 2. THE DESIRE TO RESORT TO TECHNICAL CUNNING> > 3. THE DESIRE TO DISPLAY ALL THAT HE HAS LEARNED> > 4. THE DESIRE TO PLAY A PASSIVE ROLE> > 5.

BUT AS SOON AS HIS MIND STOPS WITH EITHER OF THEM, IT LOSES ITS OWN> FLUIDITY. THE GUNG FU MAN, THEREFORE, SHOULD KEEP HIS MIND ALWAYS IN THE STATE> OF EMPTINESS SO THAT HIS FREEDOM IN ACTION WILL NEVER BE OBSTRUCTED.THE TAO OF STICKING HANDSCHI SAO, OR STICKING HANDS IN GUNG FU, IS THE CLOSEST TO TAOISM AND ZEN. THISART AIMS AT HARMONY WITH THE PRACTITIONER AND HIS OPPONENT. IT’S PRINCIPLEFOLLOWS THE TAOIST PRINCIPLE OF WU WEI. WU MEANS “NOT” OR “NON” AND WEI MEANS“ACTION,” “STRIVING,” “STRAINING,” OR “BUSYNESS.” IT DOESN’T REALLY MEAN DOINGNOTHING, BUT TO LET ONE’S MIND ALONE, TRUSTING IT TO WORK BY ITSELF. WU WEI, INGUNG FU, MEANS MIND-ACTION, IN THE SENSE THAT THE GOVERNING FORCE IS THE MINDAND NOT THAT OF THE SENSES. DURING SPARRING, A GUNG FU MAN LEARNS TO FORGETABOUT HIMSELF AND FOLLOWS THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS OPPONENT, LEAVING HIS MIND FREETO MAKE ITS OWN COUNTER-MOVEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTERFERENCE OR DELIBERATION.IN STICKING HANDS, A GUNG FU MAN FREES HIMSELF FROM ALL MENTAL SUGGESTIONS OFRESISTANCE, AND ADOPTS A SUPPLE ATTITUDE. HIS ACTIONS ARE ALL PERFORMED WITHOUTSELF-ASSERTION; HE LETS HIS MIND REMAIN SPONTANEOUS AND UNGRASPED. EVERY ACTIONIS ACTIVATED BY THOSE OF THE OPPONENT’S. HE DOES NOT RESIST OR GIVE WAYCOMPLETELY, BUT IS AS PLIABLE AS A SPRING.BECAUSE OF THE SELF THERE IS THE FOE; WHEN THERE IS NO SELF THERE IS NO FOE. THEFOE MEANS AN OPPOSITION AS THE MALE IS OPPOSED TO THE FEMALE AND FIRE TO WATER.WHATEVER THINGS HAVE FORM EXIST NECESSARILY IN OPPOSITION. WHEN THERE ARE NOSIGNS (OF THOUGHT MOVEMENT) STIRRED IN YOUR MIND, NO CONFLICTS OF OPPOSITIONTAKE PLACE THERE, AND WHEN THERE ARE NO CONFLICTS, ONE TRYING TO GET THE BETTEROF THE OTHER, THIS IS KNOWN AS “NEITHER OPPONENT NOR SELF.” WHEN, FURTHER, THEMIND ITSELF IS FORGOTTEN TOGETHER WITH SIGNS (OF THOUGHT MOVEMENT), YOU ENJOY ASTATE OF ABSOLUTELY DOING-NOTHINGNESS, YOU ARE IN A STATE OF PERFECTLY QUIETPASSIVITY, YOU’RE IN HARMONY WITH THE WORLD, YOU ARE ONE WITH IT. WHILE THEFOE-FORM CEASES TO EXIST, YOU’RE NOT CONSCIOUS OF IT. YOUR MIND IS CLEANSED OFALL THOUGHT MOVEMENT, AND YOU ACT ONLY WHEN THERE IS A PROMPTING (FROM THEUNCONSCIOUS).STICKING HANDS IS JUST LIKE THE NATURE OF WATER: WATER IS SO FINE THAT IT ISIMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT; STRIKE IT YET IT DOES NOT SUFFER HURT; STABIT AND IT IS NOT WOUNDED. LIKE WATER, A GUNG FU MAN HAS NO SHAPE OR TECHNIQUE OFHIS OWN, BUT MOLDS OR FITS HIS MOVEMENT INTO THAT OF HIS OPPONENT’S. IT IS TRUETHAT WATER IS THE WEAKEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD, YET WHEN IT ATTACKS IT CAN GOTHROUGH THE HARDEST. IT CAN BE CALM LIKE A STILL POND AND TURBULENT LIKE THENIAGARA FALLS.Image [../Images/80a.jpg]OBJECTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVITY ARE OBSCURELY GRASPED TOGETHER. IT IS THENONDIFFERENTIATING AWARENESS OF THE FACT THAT STATEMENTS SUCH AS “THIS IS ALSOTHAT; THAT IS ALSO THIS,” AND “DESTRUCTION IS CONSTRUCTION; CONSTRUCTION ISDESTRUCTION” ARE MEANINGLESS. THERE IS NO DESTRUCTION OR CONSTRUCTION. THEY FUSEINTO ONE. WHEN WE DO NOT ASSERT EITHER ACTION OR NONACTION, THIS OR THAT, BEINGOR NONBEING, WE ARE FREE FROM BOTH.Image [../Images/81a.jpg]THE PATH OF NONASSERTIONTHE UNDERSTANDING OF CHI SAO IS AN INNER EXPERIENCE IN WHICH DISTINCTION BETWEENSELF AND OPPONENT VANISHES. IT IS AN INTUITIVE, IMMEDIATE AWARENESS RATHER THANA MEDIATED, INFERENTIAL, OR INTELLECTUAL PROCESS. WHILE THE ACTION OF ASSERTION,MAN’S COMMON TENDENCY, IS PRECONCEPTUAL AND RATIONAL, IT CANNOT PENETRATE THEHIDDEN RECESSES OF CREATIVITY. THE ACTION OF ASSERTION IS VIEWED FROM THEEXTERNALS OF INTELLECTION, WHILE THE ACTION OF NONASSERTION IS ACTIVATED BY THEINNER LIGHT. THE FORMER ACTION IS LIMITED AND FINITE, THE LATTER FREE ANDLIMITLESS.CHI SAO FACTORS THAT ALL MARTIAL ARTISTS SHOULD CONSIDERIN CHI SAO, AS YOU ARE ROTATING YOUR ARMS UP AND DOWN IN SEMICIRCULAR ARCS, ITIS CRUCIAL TO FOLLOW YOUR PARTNER’S MOVEMENTS AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE AND TOMAINTAIN THE CORRECT HAND POSITION THROUGHOUT THE EXERCISE. THE CHI SAO ROTATIONPATTERN RESEMBLES THE ARCS THE ARMS WOULD TAKE IF TURNING THE OVERSIZE STEERINGWHEEL OF A LARGE BUS. TRY TO KEEP YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE THROUGHOUT THE MOVEMENT ANDNEVER ALLOW THEM TO COME CLOSER THAN THREE INCHES TO YOUR STOMACH. ALSO CONSIDERTHE FOLLOWING:> 1. THE TECHNIQUES> > 2.

CHI SAO TO PEACOCK EYEGUNG FU KICKING TECHNIQUESImage [../Images/83a.jpg]IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO INITIATE KICKING IN GUNG FU TO KEEP YOURKICKS LOW. IN TRAINING, IT IS OKAY TO KICK AS HIGH AS YOU CAN, BUT IN ACTUALCOMBAT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO KICK AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND NEVER LET YOUR KICKPASS ABOVE THE BELT AREA. IT IS TOO EASY TO BE KNOCKED OR SET OFF BALANCE BYSUCH SUDDEN TILTING OF THE TORSO AND LEGS. YOUR KICKS SHOULD ALSO CORRESPONDWITH YOUR HAND TECHNIQUES (I.E., SIMPLE, DIRECT, AND EFFICIENT WITHOUTORNAMENTATION OR ATTEMPTS AT SOPHISTICATED MOVEMENT).IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT YOUR KICKING FOOT SNAP BACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER LANDINGYOUR KICK AND DO NOT ATTEMPT HIGH OR FLYING KICKS IN A REAL FIGHT. IF YOU CAN BEPUT OFF BALANCE EASILY SIMPLY PERFORMING A STANDING KICK, YOU WILL BE TOTALLYOFF BALANCE FOR ANY TYPE OF AERIAL MANEUVER.Image [../Images/83b.jpg]Image [../Images/84a.jpg]KICKING TECHNIQUES TO PRACTICE> 1.

BUT THEY HAVE LIMITED PRACTICAL VALUE IN SELF-DEFENSE SITUATIONS.Image [../Images/87a.jpg]FIGURE 1Image [../Images/87b.jpg]FIGURE 2Image [../Images/87c.jpg]FIGURE 3Image [../Images/87d.jpg]FIGURE 4FIGURES 1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1b] AND 2 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig2b]. MAKINGSURE THAT 80 PERCENT OF YOUR WEIGHT IS ON YOUR REAR OR SUPPOTTING LEG, YOU CANQUICKLY SHOOT OUT A FRONT KICK, USING THE SOLE OR HEEL OF YOUR FOOT TO STRIKETHE STOMACH OF YOUR OPPONENT USING HIGHER KICKS, SUCH AS THE SIDE KICK AND HOOKKICK (FIGURES 3 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig3b] AND 4 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig4b],RESPECTIVELY), IN PRACTICE WILL HELP TO GIVE YOU A FEEL FOR KICKING AND ENHANCETHE BALANCE AND COORDINATION SKILLS NEEDED TO KICK EFFECTIVELY.SELF-DEFENSE CONSIDERATIONSImage [../Images/88a.jpg]WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE ATTACKED BY A THUG? WOULD YOU STAND YOUR GROUNDAND FIGHT IT OUT? OR, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD RUNLIKE HELL? BUT WHAT IF YOUR LOVED ONES WERE WITH YOU? WHAT THEN? THAT’S THEALL-IMPORTANT QUESTION.YOU HAVE ONLY TO PICK UP A NEWSPAPER TO READ OF ATTACKS MADE, NOT ONLY ON LONELYCOMMONS, BUT ALSO IN BUILT-UP AREAS, TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR SELF-DEFENSE.“TO BE FOREWARNED IS TO BE FOREARMED” IS AN OLD, RELIABLE PROVERB, AND THEPURPOSE OF MY NOTES ON SELF-DEFENSE IS NOT ONLY TO FOREWARN YOU, BUT TO FOREARMYOU WITH A PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF MEETING ANY FOE, REGARDLESS OF HIS SIZE ANDSTRENGTH.SELF-DEFENSE IS NOT FUN. YOU ARE LIABLE TO FIND YOURSELF FIGHTING HARD TO AVOIDSERIOUS INJURY AND SO YOU MUST EXPECT TO BE HURT. THE METHOD OF SELF-DEFENSE IAM GOING TO DESCRIBE WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING HURT BUT WILL GIVE YOU A VERYGOOD CHANCE OF EMERGING THE VICTOR WITHOUT ANY SEVERE INJURY. YOU WILL HAVE TOACCEPT THIS AND SHOULD A BLOW FROM YOUR OPPONENT BREAK THROUGH IT ISESSENTIAL—AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING—TO IGNORE THE PAIN CAUSED AND, INSTEAD OFGIVING UP, USE IT AS SOMETHING TO SPUR ON YOUR COUNTERATTACK AND VICTORY.BEAR THIS IN MIND: WHEN BEING ATTACKED BY A THUG, THE FACT IS THAT HE HAS BUT AONE-TRACK MIND WHICH IS BENT ON YOUR DESTRUCTION, RARELY CONSIDERING WHAT YOUCAN DO, AND IF YOUR ACTS SHOW HIM THAT HE IS UP AGAINST SOMETHING HE DID NOTEXPECT, IT WILL CUT DOWN HIS ATTACKING EGO OVER 50 PERCENT AND WILL NEUTRALIZEHIS ATTACK, IN WHICH CASE YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE ON YOURSIDE.THIS MAY NOT SOUND VERY ENCOURAGING, BUT THE CHANCES OF ATTACK CAN BE VERYGREATLY REDUCED IF YOU ARE WALKING, ESPECIALLY ALONE, AT NIGHT OR IN LONELYPLACES, IF YOU ARE ALWAYS ALERT. KEEP AN EYE ON ANY PERSON WHO APPEARS TO BEFOLLOWING YOU OR WHO APPROACHES. KEEP TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE PATH OR IN THEMIDDLE OF A LANE. LISTEN FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS AND WATCH SHADOWS; THAT IS TOSAY, AS YOU PASS A STREET LAMP YOU WILL SEE THE SHADOW OF ANYONE BEHIND YOUTHROWN UP ON THE GROUND IN FRONT OF YOU. THE SAME THING HAPPENS AS THE RESULT OFLIGHTS IN HOUSES AND THE HEADLAMPS OF PASSING CARS. AS SOON AS YOU SEE A SHADOWIN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IMMEDIATELY GLANCE AROUND AND SEE WHO IT IS. ALWAYS, OFCOURSE, AVOID PATCHES OF DEEP SHADOW.Image [../Images/89a.jpg]IN MADE-UP BUT QUIET STREETS, I REPEAT, WALK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PAVEMENT.THIS OBVIATES THE CHANCE OF ANYONE JUMPING OUT OF A HOUSE OR GARDEN ENTRANCE ATYOU TO SNATCH YOUR PURSE, HANDBAG, BRIEFCASE, OR WORSE. FOR EXACTLY THE SAMEREASON I SUGGEST WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF A LANE WHERE THERE ARE NO MADE-UPPATHS AND PERHAPS NO STREET LAMPS. IF YOU CONSIDER IT ADVISABLE, YOU CAN EVENCROSS THE ROAD TO AVOID A PERSON OF WHOM YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS. IF HE FOLLOWS, HEAT LEAST MAKES HIS INTENTION FAIRLY OBVIOUS. ALTHOUGH I AM AGAIN REPEATINGMYSELF, I MUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUCCESS OF AN ASSAILANT’S ATTACK DEPENDS ONSURPRISE, AND IF YOU’RE SUFFICIENTLY ALERT TO PREVENT A SURPRISE, YOURCOUNTERATTACK IS ALREADY HALFWAY TO BEING SUCCESSFUL. THE MAIN THING IS TO SEETHE ATTACK COMING, WHICH ENABLES YOU TO SHOUT, SCREAM, OR JUST CONCENTRATE ONDEALING WITH THE ATTACKER. IT IS ALSO ADVISABLE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE ASPOSSIBLE AS THIS NATURALLY TENDS TO FRIGHTEN OFF LAWBREAKERS.I HOPE I HAVE NOT FRIGHTENED YOU AND MADE YOU THINK IT IS NOT SAFE TO WALK ALONGTHE STREETS. THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENTION, BUT NEWSPAPER REPORTS LEAD ONETO BELIEVE THAT ATTACKS ON INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE INCREASING.Image [../Images/90a.jpg]Image [../Images/90b.jpg]Image [../Images/91a.jpg]THE SPECIAL FEATURES OF EMPLOYING GUNG FU IN SELF-DEFENSE SITUATIONS IS THATEVERY MOVEMENT HAS A FLOWING CONTINUITY WITHOUT ANY DISLOCATION; DEFENSE ISATTACK, ATTACK IS DEFENSE, EACH BEING THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER. ITSTECHNIQUES ARE SMOOTH, SHORT, AND EXTREMELY FAST; THEY ARE DIRECT, TO THE POINT,AND ARE STRIPPED DOWN TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSES WITHOUT ANY WASTED MOTIONS.SIMPLICITY IS THE KEY WORD IN THIS ART—TO DO THE UTMOST IN THE MINIMUM OF MOTIONAND ENERGY AND CAN BE PRACTICED BY BOTH SEXES.THE AVERAGE PERSON IS USUALLY OVER-IMPRESSED BY THE SIZE AND ARROGANCE OF HISPOSSIBLE OPPONENT WHO USUALLY USES HIS THUGGISH ARROGANCE FOR ALL IT IS WORTH,SEEKING TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE BLUFF TO FRIGHTEN OR SUBORDINATE YOUR RESISTANCETO HIS APPARENT SUPERIOR SIZE AND BRUTAL GRIMACES, NEITHER OF WHICH ARE POSITIVEPROOF OF HIS ABILITY TO SUBDUE YOU. HE WORKS ON THE COMMON IDEA THAT A SMALLERPERSON IS USUALLY SCARED BY HIS SIZE—BUT DON’T BE FOOLED. PAY ABSOLUTELY NOATTENTION TO HIS SIZE, HIS ARROGANCE, FIERCE FACIAL CONTORTIONS, NOR HIS VISCOUSLANGUAGE. THEY ARE JUST PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS THAT ARE NO CRITERION AS TO HISACTUAL STRENGTH AND COMBAT EFFICIENCY. THEY HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE FACTORS BUT ARENO MORE TO THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO LEARN THE VALUE OF THE OLD AXIOM—“THE BIGGERTHEY ARE, THE HARDER THEY FALL.”SIZE IS NEVER A TRUE INDICATION OF MUSCULAR POWER AND EFFICIENCY, AS ALL CHINESEBOXING MASTERS KNOW ONLY TOO WELL. THE SMALLER MAN USUALLY MAKES UP FOR THEBALANCE OF POWER BY HIS GREATER AGILITY, FLEXIBILITY, SPEED OF FOOT, AND NERVOUSACTION. BEAR THIS IN MIND ONCE YOU GO INTO ACTION AND FIGHT WITH YOUR OPPONENTAT HIS WEAKEST POINTS OF VANTAGE WHICH ARE MAINLY GRAVITATION, THROWING HIM OFFBALANCE, AND APPLYING SUCH LEVERAGE PRINCIPLES SO THAT HIS BODY IS USED TOWARDHIS OWN DEFEAT. ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT ONCE YOU HESITATE, OR STOP, THE STRONGERPERSON HAS THE CHANCE TO BRING HIS STRENGTH TO BEAR, BUT NEVER IF YOU KEEPMOVING, AND ARE PARTICULARLY FASTER THAN HE.THE ONLY ONE POINT TO BEAR IN MIND WHEN BEING ATTACKED BY A THUG IS THE FACTTHAT THE THUG HAS BUT A ONE-TRACK MIND. HE THINKS IN BUT ONE GROOVE, WHICH ISBENT ON YOUR DESTRUCTION, RARELY CONSIDERING WHAT YOU CAN DO. IF YOUR ACT ANDATTITUDE INSTANTLY SHOW YOUR OPPONENT THAT HE IS UP AGAINST SOMETHING HE DID NOTEXPECT, IT WILL CUT DOWN HIS ATTACKING EGO OVER 50 PERCENT, CAUSING HIM EITHERTO STOP HIS INTENDED ATTACK OR EVEN TURN TAIL—IN WHICH CASE YOU ALWAYS CANRELAX.SOME SELF-DEFENSE TECHNIQUESImage [../Images/92a.jpg]FIGURE 1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1f].

THUS,OBSERVE, DEDUCE, AND APPLY. THE THREE FACTORS INFLUENCING A SUCCESSFUL ATTACKARE A FINE SENSE OF TIMING, A PERFECT JUDGMENT OF DISTANCE, AND A CORRECTAPPLICATION OF CADENCE. THEREFORE, IF YOU CAN ACT SO AS TO DISTURB YOUROPPONENT’S RHYTHM BY CAUSING HIM TO LOSE A PERIOD OF GUNG FU TIME, YOU WILLBETTER YOUR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS.A GOOD GUNG FU MAN SHOULD DEVELOP GREAT MOBILITY AND ACQUIRE A FINE SENSE OFDISTANCE, LEARNING HOW TO BREAK GROUND EFFECTIVELY. HIS STANCE SHOULD BESLIGHTLY SHORTER IN ORDER TO KEEP THE LEADING LEG AND FOOT OUT OF RANGE OF ASUDDEN KICK AND HIS MOBILITY OR BREAKING OF GROUND SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED BYSMALL AND RAPID STEPS. FACTORS SUCH AS DISTANCE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE AMOUNTOF TARGET TO BE PROTECTED AND THE PARTS OF THE BODY THAT ARE MOST EASILY WITHINTHE ADVERSARY’S REACH. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO ADVANCE OR RETIRE BEFORE, WHILE, ORAFTER THE STRIKE OR KICK AT WHICH YOU ARE WORKING HAS BEEN EXECUTED.TWO TREMENDOUSLY EFFECTIVE COUNTER-OFFENSIVE ACTIONS ARE THE STOP HIT AND THETIME HIT, BOTH OF WHICH MAKE THE ADVERSARY RESPECT HIS DISTANCE.THE STOP HITTHE STOP HIT IS A COUNTER DEFENSE/OFFENSE AGAINST AN OPPONENT WHO ATTACKSWILDLY, WITH INSUFFICIENT CARE TO PROTECT HIMSELF, OR WHO COMES TOO CLOSE.THE TIME HITTHE TIME HIT REQUIRES ONE TO DO THE FOLLOWING:> 1. THE FINAL LINE IN WHICH THE ATTACK IS DELIVERED MUST BE ANTICIPATED.> > 2. THE EXECUTANT MUST BE COVERED (PROTECTED).> > 3. THE TIMING OF THE STROKE MUST BE PERFECT.THE LEADING RIGHT SHIN/KNEE STOP KICKWHEN YOUR OPPONENT ATTACKS YOU, HE HAS TO COME TO YOU, AND THIS ACTION OF COMINGTOWARD YOU OFFERS YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY THE THEORY OF ATTACK JUSTOUTLINED. IT IS ALWAYS WISE TO USE THE LONGEST WEAPON AGAINST THE NEARESTTARGET. WHEN YOUR OPPONENT ADVANCES TOWARD YOU, HE PRESENTS TO YOU HIS “ADVANCEDTARGET” OF HIS SHIN AND KNEE. BEFORE HIS ATTACK IS HALFWAY THROUGH, YOU CAN STOPKICK HIM AND THUS, CHECK HIS ATTACK.> 1. A AND B FACING EACH OTHER> > 2.

THIS FINGER JAB CAN ALSO BESUCCESSFULLY USED AGAINST AN OPPONENT WHO FEINTS, OR SWINGS WILDLY. IT IS ASIMPLE BUT PRACTICAL TECHNIQUE; YOU WILL BE AMAZED HOW A SIMPLE FINGER JAB LIKETHIS CAN INTERRUPT AND UPSET YOUR OPPONENT’S FANCY MESS.Image [../Images/96a.jpg]THE PRACTICE OF FORMS—ONE OF THE MEANS TO AN ENDGUNG FU CAN BE PRACTICED ALONE OR WITH A PARTNER. PRACTICING ALONE INVOLVES THEUSE OF FORMS, A SERIES OF COMBATIVE MOVEMENTS THAT ARE PERFORMED AND PRACTICEDIN SUCCESSION. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF FORMS IN GUNG FU, MANY OF WHICH ARE BASEDON THE COMBATIVE MOVEMENTS OF ANIMALS, SUCH AS THE CRANE, THE MONKEY, THEPRAYING MANTIS, AND SO ON.Image [../Images/97a.jpg]SOME POSTURES FROM THE TIGER (FIGURE 1 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1g], LEFT) ANDCRANE (FIGURE 2 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#fig1g], RIGHT) FORMS OF CHINESE GUNG FU.THE METHOD OF PRACTICING FORMS SHOULD BE VERY FLUID AS YOU TRANSITION FROM ONEMOVEMENT OR TECHNIQUE TO ANOTHER. THIS IS BASED ON THE OLD GUNG FU PRINCIPLE“FLOWING WATER AS RUNNING WATER NEVER GROWS STALE.” APART FROM THE CULTIVATIONOF PROPER BODY ALIGNMENT AND DELIVERY OF TECHNIQUES, THE PRACTICE OF FORMS ISNOT ALL THAT STRENUOUS. SUCH NONSTRENUOUS EXERCISE SERVES TO NORMALIZE—INSTEADOF OVERDEVELOPING OR OVEREXERTING—THE BODY.WING CHUN’S SIL LUM TAOA GREAT FORM (PARTICULARLY THE FIRST THIRD) FOR LEARNING MOST OF THE DEFENSIVEPOSITIONS NEEDED FOR THE EFFECTIVE APPLICATION OF WING CHUN GUNG FU IS THE SILLUM TAO (OR LITTLE IMAGINATION). IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN PERFORMING THIS FORM TOKEEP YOUR ELBOWS IN TOWARD THE CENTER, WITH YOUR ARMS IN A STATE OFSEMICONTRACTION, AND THE FOREARMS LEVEL WHEN IN THE LOWER POSITIONS.Image [../Images/98a.jpg]FIGURE 1Image [../Images/98b.jpg]FIGURE 2Image [../Images/98c.jpg]FIGURE 3SOME POSTURES FROM SIL LUM TAO.

THE MAIN PARTS OF THEBODY THAT SHOULD BE WARMED UP ARE:1. THE WAIST—THE WAIST CAN BEST BE WARMED UP BY PERFORMING EXERCISES SUCH ASTWISTING, BENDING TO THE FRONT, BACK, LEFT, AND RIGHT, AND BY ROTATING THE HIPS.2. THE LEGS—THE BEST EXERCISES TO EMPLOY FOR LIMBERING UP THE LEGS ARE MAINLYSTRETCHING OR HIGH KICKING EXERCISES. IF YOU CHOOSE HIGH KICKING, FOCUS ON THEFRONT KICK AND THE SIDE KICK.3. THE SHOULDERS—AN EFFICIENT WARM-UP FOR THE SHOULDERS WOULD INVOLVE WIDE ARMCIRCLES OR ROTATIONS AND PULLING BACK WITH YOUR ARMS SO THAT A MILD STRETCH OFTHE SHOULDER GIRDLE IS ACHIEVED.4. THE ARMS—THE BEST WARM-UP FOR THE ARMS WOULD BE MAINLY EXERCISES SUCH ASPUSH-UPS OR ANY BASIC WEIGHT-TRAINING EXERCISE (SUCH AS BARBELL CURLS) WHICHHAVE PROVEN BENEFICIAL.5. THE WRIST—THE MOST EFFICIENT WARM-UP FOR THE WRISTS IS SIMPLY ROTATING THEMIN CLOCKWISE AND COUNTERCLOCKWISE CIRCLES. YOU CAN ALSO CONTRACT OR FLEX THEEXTENSOR MUSCLES IN YOUR FOREARMS AGAINST RESISTANCE WITH EXERCISES SUCH AS ASEATED WRIST CURL OR STANDING REVERSE BARBELL CURL WITH WEIGHT.Image [../Images/102a.jpg]Image [../Images/103a.jpg]Image [../Images/103b.jpg]Image [../Images/103c.jpg]Image [../Images/104a.jpg]THE IMPORTANT THING WITH REGARD TO TRAINING IS TO USE YOUR OWN IDEAS BASED ONWHAT YOU THINK YOU NEED (E.G., INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR HIPS, WAIST,SHOULDERS, ETC.). THINK CONSTANTLY ABOUT CREATING NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE THEFUNCTIONING OF YOUR BODY IN THE ART OF GUNG FU AND THE HELL WITH CONVENTIONALMETHODS AND OPINIONS.Image [../Images/104b.jpg]TECHNIQUE TRAININGIT IS IMPORTANT TO PRACTICE PARTNER FACING IN YOUR WORKOUTS. IF YOU CAN KEEPYOUR NOSE FACING THAT OF YOUR PARTNER/OPPONENT AS HE MANEUVERS AROUND THE ROOM,YOU WILL DEVELOP MORE PROFICIENCY IN GUARDING AND MAINTAINING YOUR CENTERLINE.Image [../Images/105a.jpg]IN PRACTICING TECHNIQUES SUCH AS PUNCHING AND KICKING, I HAVE FOUND THEFOLLOWING APPARATUS TO BE USEFUL IN GUNG FU TRAINING:> 1. A LARGE, HANGING HEAVY BAG> > 2. A SMALL STRIKING PAD ON A PINE BOARD> > 3. A HANGING WALL BAG> > 4. A SMALL HANGING BAG> > 5. IRON RINGS> > 6. A SAND DISH> > 7. A MOOK JONG (WOODEN DUMMY)> > 8.

A SKIPPING ROPESOME CLASSICAL GUNG FU EQUIPMENT AND THEIR USESTHE WOODEN DUMMYImage [../Images/106a.jpg]ONE UNIQUE BUT USEFUL PIECE OF TRAINING EQUIPMENT I USE IS THE PORTABLE WOODENDUMMY. I USE THE DUMMY TO DEVELOP POWER AND BETTER TECHNIQUES. THE DUMMY ISAPPROXIMATELY SIX FEET TALL AND TWELVE INCHES IN DIAMETER. IT IS ERECTED UPON ANEIGHT FOOT BY EIGHT FOOT PLATFORM AND SUPPORTED BY A METAL SPRING. THE DUMMY HASTWO PORTABLE HANDS BELOW THE NECK AND ANOTHER IN THE CENTER. THEY STRETCH OUTABOUT TWO FEET. THE HANDS ARE CONSTRUCTED LOOSELY AND ARE REMOVABLE. THE DUMMYALSO HAS ONE METAL LEG THAT EXTENDS OUT AND DOWNWARD.I MAKE USE OF THE DUMMY’S HANDS TO PRACTICE BLOCKS AND PUNCHES AND ALSO FORTECHNIQUES IN STICKING HANDS. THE DUMMY WILL NEVER REPLACE A LIVE SPARRING MATE,BUT IT IS VERY USEFUL FOR BLOCKING AND PULLING TECHNIQUES WHICH CAN BE DONE WITHFULL FORCE AS THE DUMMY CANNOT BE DAMAGED. IT IS ALSO USEFUL IN TEACHING ONE TOPUNCH STRAIGHT. THE DUMMY’S FOOT IS ALSO BENEFICIAL IN TEACHING THE MARTIALARTIST TO ALWAYS PLACE HIS FRONT LEG AUTOMATICALLY TO LOCK OR OBSTRUCT HISOPPONENT’S LEG, THUS PREVENTING HIM FROM KICKING. IT IS ALSO VALUABLE FORPRACTICING SHIN KICKS.Image [../Images/107a.jpg]THE SQUARE WALL HAGANOTHER PIECE OF APPARATUS THAT I FIND VERY HELPFUL IN MY GUNG FU TRAINING ISTHE SQUARE WALL BAG FILLED WITH BEANS, WHICH DEVELOPS DEPTH AND PENETRATIONTECHNIQUES. IT ALSO GIVES A FEELING OF HITTING SOMEONE. IT IS A WONDERFULTRAINING APPARATUS TO DEVELOP WRIST STRENGTH FOR PERFECTING YOUR STRAIGHTPUNCHING TECHNIQUE. THE BAG SHOULD BE MOUNTED AGAINST A WALL AT APPROXIMATELYNOSE LEVEL. THE WALL BAG IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN DEVELOPING IMPACT POWER IN YOURPUNCHING TECHNIQUES, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT AN END ITSELF AS TOO MUCH WALL BAGPUNCHING CAN RETARD YOUR SPEED.AIR PUNCHING/KICKINGBALANCING OUT YOUR POWER TRAINING SHOULD BE SPEED TRAINING. THE TECHNIQUE OFTHROWING PUNCHES WITHOUT ACTUALLY MAKING CONTACT (I.E., AIR PUNCHING) ISUTILIZED TO DEVELOP SPEED IN YOUR TECHNIQUES. I SHOULD CAUTION YOU, HOWEVER,THAT TOO MUCH AIR PUNCHING COULD POSSIBLY DAMAGE THE ELBOW OR CAUSE TENDONITIS.THE HANGING PAPERTHE HANGING PAPER IS A GOOD EXERCISE TO DEVELOP PRECISION IN YOUR STRAIGHTPUNCHING. HANG A SHEET OF PAPER (8 × 10) FROM THE CEILING (PREFERABLY BY A CHAINSO THAT IT RETURNS INSTANTLY TO A VERTICAL POSITION AFTER YOU STRIKE IT) ANDTHEN PUNCH AT IT WITH A SERIES OF STRAIGHT PUNCHES IN RAPID SUCCESSION IT SHOULDHELP YOU TO DEVELOP SNAP AND IMPACT POWER IN YOUR TECHNIQUES.IRON RINGSFOR BETTER RESULTS IN SIL LUM TAO, I ADVOCATE USING IRON RINGS ON ONE’S FOREARMSWHILE DOING TAN SAO (PALM-UP BLOCK) AND FOOK SAO (PALM-DOWN, BENT-ARM, ELBOW-INBLOCK), AS THE WEIGHT GIVES THE ACTUAL RESISTANCE OF THE OPPONENT’S ARM PRESSINGON YOU. INSTEAD OF PURE IMAGINATION, A REAL FEELING IS BEING FELT ON THE ARMS ASTHEY SLOWLY GO OUTWARD FROM THE BODY. THE MAIN POINT IS THAT WITH THE WEIGHTS ONYOUR WRIST—AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY HOLDING A DUMBBELL—YOU CAN KEEP YOUR FINGERS ANDWRISTS RELAXED, AS THEY NEED TO BE IN CHI SAO. I SHOWED THE IRON RINGS METHOD(I’VE MADE FOUR PAIRS, AT THREE POUNDS EACH) TO MY INSTRUCTOR IN WING CHUN, YIPMAN, AND HE IS CONVINCED WHEN I DEMONSTRATED TO HIM THAT IN SIL LUM TAO, WHENTHE TAN SAO IS COMING OUT, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOING INTO A FOOK SAO, AND WHENA FOOK SAO IS COMING OUT, IT IS SUPPOSED TO STOP THE ONCOMING. THUS, THE IRONRINGS WILL GIVE THE NECESSARY RESISTANCE WHEN THE PRACTITIONER DIRECTS HISENERGY OUT WARD WITHOUT TENSING HIS FINGERS AND WRISTS. FURTHER, AS ONEPROGRESSES ALONG IN HIS TRAINING, MORE AND MORE RESISTANCE CAN BE PROVIDED BYSIMPLY WEARING MORE IRON RINGS ON ONE’S ARMS. THIS IS AN ALIVE WAY OF BUILDINGWITHOUT GETTING THE HANDS RIGID. THIS IS A KIND OF MODERNIZED PROGRESSIVEWEIGHT-TRAINING METHOD THAT IS EFFECTIVE.Image [../Images/108a.jpg]MAKE USE OF THE WOODEN DUMMY AND SOME OF THE OTHER EQUIPMENT I’VE MENTIONEDABOVE IN YOUR OWN GUNG FU TRAINING.

TO THE CHINESE, GUNG FU IS A WAY OF TRAINING THE MIND ASWELL AS A WAY OF LIFE. THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF GUNG FU CANNOT BE LEARNED BYFACT-FINDING OR INSTRUCTION IN FACTS. IT HAS TO GROW SPONTANEOUSLY, LIKE AFLOWER, IN A MIND FREE FROM DESIRES AND EMOTIONS. THE CORE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OFGUNG FU IS TAO—THE SPONTANEITY OF THE UNIVERSE.THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TAO IS CALLED TAOISM AND IS EXPRESSED CHIEFLY THROUGH THEWRITINGS OF LAO-TZU IN HIS BOOK, THE TAO TE CHING (THE BOOK OF THE WAY). THEPHILOSOPHY OF TAOISM REVEALS THE ESSENTIAL UNITY OF THE UNIVERSE (MONISM)—ORREVERSION, POLARIZATION (YIN/YANG), AND ETERNAL CYCLES—OF THE LEVELING OF ALLDIFFERENCES, THE RELATIVITY OF AIL STANDARDS, AND THE RETURN OF ALL TO THEPRIMEVAL ONENESS, THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE, THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS. FROM THISNATURALLY ARISES THE ABSENCE OF DESIRE FOR STRIFE AND CONTENTION AND FIGHTINGFOR ADVANTAGE. THUS, THE TEACHINGS OF HUMILITY AND MEEKNESS OF THE CHRISTIAN“SERMON ON THE MOUNT” FIND A RATIONAL BASIS AND A PEACEABLE TEMPER IS BRED INMAN. IT EMPHASIZES NON-RESISTANCE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF GENTLENESS.Image [../Images/117a.jpg]THE BASIC IDEA OF THE TAO TE CHING IS NATURALISM IN THE SENSE OF WU-WEI(NONDOING), WHICH REALLY MEANS TAKING NO UNNATURAL ACTION. IT MEANS SPONTANEITY;THAT IS, “TO SUPPORT AIL THINGS IN THEIR NATURAL STAGE” AND THUS ALLOW THEM TO“TRANSFORM SPONTANEOUSLY.” IN THIS MANNER TAO “UNDERTAKES NO ACTIVITY AND YETTHERE IS NOTHING LEFT UNDONE.” IN ORDINARY LIFE IT IS EXPRESSED IN “PRODUCINGAND REARING THINGS WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF THEM” AND “DOING WORK BUT NOTTAKING PRIDE IN IT”—THUS THE NATURAL WAY STANDS IN COMPLEMENT TO ALL ARTIFICIALWAYS SUCH AS REGULATION, CEREMONIES, ETC. THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE TAOISTSDON’T LIKE FORMALITIES AND ARTIFICIALITY.THE NATURAL WAY IS COMPARED WITH THE WAYS OF WATER. THE FEMALE AND THE INFANT;THAT IS, THE WAY OF THE WEAK. WHILE THERE SEEMS TO BE GLORIFICATION OF THE WEAK,THE STRONGEST STRESS REALLY LIES WITH SIMPLICITY. A SIMPLE LIFE IS ONE OFPLAINNESS IN WHICH PROFIT IS DISCARDED, CLEVERNESS ABANDONED, SELFISHNESSELIMINATED, AND DESIRES REDUCED. IT IS THE LIFE OF “PERFECTION WHICH SEEMS TO BEINCOMPLETE AND OF FULLNESS WHICH SEEMS TO BE EMPTY.” IT IS THE LIFE WHICH IS ASBRIGHT AS LIGHT BUT DOES NOT DAZZLE. IN SHORT, IT IS A LIFE OF HARMONY, UNITY,CONTENTMENT, TRANQUILLITY, CONSTANCY, ENLIGHTENMENT, PEACE, AND LONG LIFE.THE WORD TAO HAS NO EXACT EQUIVALENT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. TO RENDER IT INTOWAY, PRINCIPLE, OR LAW IS TO GIVE IT TOO NARROW AN INTERPRETATION. LAO-TZU, THEFOUNDER OF TAOSIM, DESCRIBED TAO IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS:> THE WAY WHICH CAN BE EXPRESSED IN WORDS IS NOT THE ETERNAL WAY; THE NAME WHICH> CAN BE UTTERED IS NOT THE ETERNAL NAME. CONCEIVED OF AS NAMELESS, IT IS THE> CAUSE OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. CONCEIVED OF AS HAVING A NAME, IT IS THE MOTHER OF> ALL THINGS. ONLY THE MAN ETERNALLY FREE FROM PASSION CAN CONTEMPLATE ITS> SPIRITUAL ESSENCE. HE WHO IS CLOGGED BY DESIRES CAN SEE NO MORE THAN ITS OUTER> FORM. THESE TWO THINGS, THE SPIRITUAL (YIN) AND THE MATERIAL (YANG), THOUGH WE> CALL THEM BY DIFFERENT NAMES, ARE ONE AND THE SAME IN THEIR ORIGIN. THE> SAMENESS IS A MYSTERY OF THE MYSTERIES. IT IS THE GATE OF ALL THAT IS SUBTLE> AND WONDERFUL.> > IN MASTERPIECES OF WORLD PHILOSOPHY> > TAO IS THE NAMELESS BEGINNING OF THINGS, THE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING> EVERYTHING, THE SUPREME, ULTIMATE PATTERN, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH.> > HUSTON SMITH, THE AUTHOR OF WORLD RELIGION, EXPLAINED TAO AS:> > THE WAY OF ULTIMATE REALITY—THE WAY OR PRINCIPLE BEHIND ALL LIFE, OR THE WAY> MAN SHOULD ORDER HIS LIFE TO GEAR IN WITH THE WAY THE UNIVERSE OPERATES.ALTHOUGH NO ONE WORD CAN SUBSTITUTE ITS MEANING, I HAVE USED THE WORD TRUTH FORIT—THE TRUTH BEHIND GUNG FU; THE TRUTH THAT EVERY GUNG FU PRACTITIONER SHOULDFOLLOW.YIN AND YANGTAO OPERATES IN YIN AND YANG, A PAIR OF MUTUALLY COMPLEMENTARY FORCES THAT AREAT WORK IN AND BEHIND ALL PHENOMENA. THIS PRINCIPLE OF YIN/YANG, ALSO KNOWN AST’AI CHI, IS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF GUNG FU. HOWEVER, AS I’VE GONE INTO DETAILABOUT YIN/YANG ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK, I WILL SIMPLY REFER YOU TO CHAPTER TWOFOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE.APPLIED YIN-YANG: THE LAW OF HARMONYTHE APPLICATION OF THE THEORY OF YIN-YANG IN GUNG FU IS KNOWN AS THE LAW OFHARMONY, IN WHICH ONE SHOULD BE IN HARMONY WITH, AND NOT IN OPPOSITION TO, THESTRENGTH AND FORCE OF THE OPPOSITION. THIS MEANS THAT ONE SHOULD DO NOTHING THATIS NOT NATURAL OR SPONTANEOUS; THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO STRAIN IN ANY WAY.SUPPOSE OPPONENT A APPLIES FORCE ON OPPONENT B; B SHOULD NOT GIVE WAY TO IT (FORTHESE ARE THE TWO EXTREME OPPOSITES OF B’S REACTION TO A’S FORCE). INSTEAD, BSHOULD COMPLETE A’S FORCE WITH A LESSER FORCE (FIRMNESS IN GENTLENESS) AND LEADHIM TO THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN FORCE AND MOVEMENT. THIS SPONTANEOUS ASSISTINGOF A’S MOVEMENT AS HE AIMS IT WILL RESULT IN HIS OWN DEFEAT. AS THE BUTCHERPRESERVES HIS KNIFE BY CUTTING ALONG THE BONE AND NOT AGAINST IT, A GUNG FU MANPRESERVES HIMSELF BY FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT WITHOUT OPPOSITION.THEREFORE GENTLENESS ALONE CAN’T FOREVER DISSOLVE AWAY GREAT FORCE, NOR SHEERBRUTE FORCE TO SUBDUE ONE’S FOE. IN ORDER TO SURVIVE IN COMBAT, THE HARMONIOUSINTERFUSION OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS IS NECESSARY; WITH ONE SOMETIMESDOMINATING THE OTHER AND VICE VERSA, IN A WAVELIKE SUCCESSION. THE MOVEMENT WILLTHEN TRULY FLOW; FOR THE TRUE FLUIDITY OF MOVEMENT IS IN ITS INTERCHANGEABILITY.THIS IS ALSO TRUE IN LIFE.Image [../Images/120a.jpg]THE LAW OF NONINTERFERENCE WITH NATURETHE ABOVE IDEA GIVES RISE TO A CLOSELY RELATED LAW, THE LAW OF NONINTERFERENCEWITH NATURE, WHICH TEACHES A GUNG FU MAN TO FORGET ABOUT HIMSELF AND FOLLOW HISOPPONENT (STRENGTH) INSTEAD OF HIMSELF; HE DOES NOT MOVE AHEAD BUT RESPONDS TOTHE FITTING INFLUENCE. THE BASIC IDEA IS TO DEFEAT THE OPPONENT BY YIELDING TOHIM AND USING HIS OWN STRENGTH AGAINST HIM. THAT IS WHY A GUNG FU MAN NEVERASSERTS HIMSELF AGAINST HIS OPPONENT, AND NEVER PUTS HIMSELF IN FRONTALOPPOSITION TO THE DIRECTION OF HIS FORCE. WHEN BEING ATTACKED, HE WILL NOTRESIST, BUT WILL CONTROL THE ATTACK BY SWINGING WITH IT. THIS LAW ILLUSTRATESTHE PRINCIPLES OF NONRESISTANCE AND NONVIOLENCE, WHICH WERE FOUNDED ON THE IDEATHAT THE BRANCHES OF A FIR TREE SNAPPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE SNOW, WHILE THESIMPLE REEDS, WEAKER BUT MORE SUPPLE, CAN OVERCOME IT. IN THE I’ CHING,CONFUCIUS ILLUSTRATED THIS: “TO STAND IN THE STREAM IS A DATUM OF NATURE; ONEMUST FOLLOW AND FLOW WITH IT.” IN TAO TE CHING, THE GOSPEL OF TAOISM, LAO-TZUPOINTED OUT TO US THE VALUE OF GENTLENESS. CONTRARY TO COMMON BELIEF, THE YINPRINCIPLE, AS SOFTNESS AND PLIABLENESS, IS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE ANDSURVIVAL. BECAUSE HE CAN YIELD, A MAN CAN SURVIVE. IN CONTRAST, THE YANGPRINCIPLE, WHICH IS ASSUMED TO BE RIGOROUS AND HARD, MAKES A MAN BREAK UNDERPRESSURE (NOTE THE LAST TWO LINES, WHICH MAKE A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF REVOLUTIONAS MANY GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT):> ALIVE, A MAN IS SUPPLE, SOFT,> > IN DEATH, UNBENDING, RIGOROUS.> > ALL CREATURES, GRASS AND TREES, ALIVE ARE PLASTIC BUT ARE PLIANT TOO,> > AND DEAD, ARE FRIABLE AND DRY.> > UNBENDING RIGOR IS THE MATE OF DEATH,> > AND YIELDING SOFTNESS, COMPANY OF LIFE.> > UNBENDING SOLDIERS GET NO VICTORIES;> > THE STIFFEST TREE IS READIEST FOR THE AX.> > THE STRONG AND MIGHTY TOPPLE FROM THEIR PLACE;> > THE SOFT AND YIELDING RISE ABOVE THEM ALL.THE WAY OF MOVEMENT IN GUNG FU IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE MIND.IN FACT, THE MIND IS TRAINED TO DIRECT THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY. THE MIND WILLSAND THE BODY BEHAVES. AS THE MIND IS TO DIRECT THE BODILY MOVEMENTS, THE WAY TOCONTROL THE MIND IS IMPORTANT; BUT IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK. IN HIS BOOK POWER INATHLETICS, GLEN CLARK MENTIONED SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCES IN ATHLETICS:EVERY CONFLICTING CENTER, EVERY EXTRANEOUS, DISRUPTING, DECENTRALIZING EMOTION,JARS THE NATURAL RHYTHM AND REDUCES A MAN’S EFFICIENCY ON THE GRIDIRON FAR MORESERIOUSLY THAN PHYSICAL JARS AND BODILY CONFLICTS CAN EVER JAR HIM. THE EMOTIONSTHAT DESTROY THE INNER RHYTHM OF A MAN ARE HATRED, JEALOUSY, LUST, ENVY, PRIDE,VANITY, COVETOUSNESS, AND FEAR.Image [../Images/122a.jpg]TO PERFORM THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE IN GUNG FU, PHYSICAL LOOSENING MUST BE CONTINUEDIN A MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL LOOSENING, SO AS TO MAKE THE MIND FREE AND AGILE. INORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, A GUNG FU MAN HAS TO REMAIN QUIET AND CALM AND TOMASTER THE PRINCIPLE OF NO-MINDEDNESS (WU-HSIN).ON WU-HSIN (NO-MINDEDNESS)Image [../Images/123a.jpg]THE PHENOMENON OF WU-HSIN, OR “NO-MINDEDNESS,” IS NOT A BLANK MIND THAT SHUTSOUT ALL THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS; NOR IS IT SIMPLY CALMNESS AND QUIETNESS OF MIND.ALTHOUGH QUIETUDE AND CALMNESS ARE NECESSARY, IT IS THE “NON-GRASPINGNESS” OFTHOUGHTS THAT MAINLY CONSTITUTES THE PRINCIPLE OF NO MIND. A GUNG FU MAN EMPLOYSHIS MIND AS A MIRROR—IT GRASPS NOTHING AND REFUSES NOTHING; IT RECEIVES BUT DOESNOT KEEP. AS ALLAN WATTS PUTS IT, THE NO-MINDEDNESS IS:A STATE OF WHOLENESS IN WHICH THE MIND FUNCTIONS FREELY AND EASILY, WITHOUT THESENSATION OF A SECOND MIND OR EGO STANDING OVER IT WITH A CLUB.WHAT HE MEANS IS: LET THE MIND THINK WHAT IT LIKES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE BY THESEPARATE THINKER OR EGO WITHIN ONESELF. SO LONG AS IT THINKS WHAT IT WANTS,THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT IN LETTING IT GO; AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THEEFFORT TO LET GO IS PRECISELY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SEPARATE THINKER. THEREIS NOTHING TO TRY TO DO, FOR WHATEVER COMES UP MOMENT BY MOMENT IS ACCEPTED,INCLUDING NONACCEPTANCE. NO-MINDEDNESS IS, THEN, NOT BEING WITHOUT EMOTION ORFEELING, BUT BEING ONE IN WHOM FEELING IS NOT STICKY OR BLOCKED. IT IS A MINDIMMUNE TO EMOTIONAL INFLUENCES.LIKE THIS RIVER, EVERYTHING IS FLOWING ON CEASELESSLY WITHOUT CESSATION ORSTANDING STILL.NO-MINDEDNESS IS TO EMPLOY THE WHOLE MIND AS WE USE THE EYES WHEN WE REST THEMUPON VARIOUS OBJECTS BUT MAKE NO SPECIAL EFFORT TO TAKE ANYTHING IN. CHUANG-TZU,THE DISCIPLE OF LAO-TZU, STATED:THE BABY LOOKS AT THINGS ALL DAY WITHOUT WINKING, THAT IS BECAUSE HIS EYES ARENOT FOCUSED ON ANY PARTICULAR OBJECT. HE GOES WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE IS GOING,AND STOPS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE IS DOING. HE MERGES HIMSELF WITH THESURROUNDINGS AND MOVES ALONG WITH IT. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF MENTALHYGIENE.THEREFORE, CONCENTRATION IN GUNG FU DOES NOT HAVE THE USUAL SENSE OF RESTRICTINGTHE ATTENTION TO A SINGLE SENSE OBJECT, BUT IS SIMPLY A QUIET AWARENESS OFWHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE HERE AND NOW. SUCH CONCENTRATION CAN BE ILLUSTRATED BY ANAUDIENCE AT A FOOTBALL GAME; INSTEAD OF A CONCENTRATED ATTENTION ON THE PLAYERTHAT HAS THE BALL, THEY HAVE AN AWARENESS OF THE WHOLE FOOTBALL FIELD. IN ASIMILAR WAY, A GUNG FU MAN’S MIND IS CONCENTRATED BY NOT DWELLING ON ANYPARTICULAR PART OF THE OPPONENT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN DEALING WITH MANYOPPONENTS. FOR INSTANCE, SUPPOSE TEN MEN ARE ATTACKING HIM, EACH IN SUCCESSIONREADY TO STRIKE HIM DOWN. AS SOON AS ONE IS DISPOSED OF, HE WILL MOVE ON TOANOTHER WITHOUT PERMITTING THE MIND TO STOP WITH ANY. HOWEVER RAPIDLY ONE BLOWMAY FOLLOW ANOTHER, HE LEAVES NO TIME TO INTERVENE BETWEEN THE TWO. EVERYONE OFTHE TEN WILL THUS BE SUCCESSIVELY AND SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH. THIS IS POSSIBLEONLY WHEN THE MIND MOVES FROM ONE OBJECT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING STOPPED ORARRESTED BY ANYTHING. IF THE MIND IS UNABLE TO MOVE ON IN THIS FASHION, IT ISSURE TO LOSE THE COMBAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO ENCOUNTERS.Image [../Images/125a.jpg]HIS MIND IS PRESENT EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT IS NOWHERE ATTACHED TO ANY PARTICULAROBJECT. AND IT CAN REMAIN PRESENT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN RELATED TO THIS OR THATOBJECT, IT DOES NOT CLING TO IT. THE FLOW OF THOUGHT IS LIKE WATER FILLING APOND, WHICH IS ALWAYS READY TO FLOW OFF AGAIN. IT CAN WORK ITS INEXHAUSTIBLEPOWER BECAUSE IT IS FREE, AND BE OPEN TO EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT IS EMPTY. THISCAN BE COMPARED WITH WHAT CHANG CHEN CHI CALLED “SERENE REFLECTION.” HE WROTE:SERENE MEANS TRANQUILLITY OF NO THOUGHT, AND REFLECTION MEANS VIVID AND CLEARAWARENESS. THEREFORE, SERENE REFLECTION IS CLEAR AWARENESS OF NO-THOUGHT.AS STATED EARLIER, A GUNG FU MAN AIMS AT HARMONY WITH HIMSELF AND HIS OPPONENT.IT ALSO STATED THAT HARMONY WITH ONE’S OPPONENT IS POSSIBLE NOT THROUGH FORCE,WHICH PROVOKES CONFLICTS AND REACTIONS, BUT THROUGH A YIELDING TO HIS FORCE. INOTHER WORDS, A GUNG FU MAN PROMOTES THE SPONTANEOUS DEVELOPMENT OF HIS OPPONENTAND DOES NOT VENTURE TO INTERFERE BY HIS OWN ACTION. HE LOSES HIMSELF BY GIVINGUP ALL SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS AND INDIVIDUALITY, AND BECOMES ONE WITH HIS OPPONENT.INSIDE HIS MIND OPPOSITIONS HAVE BECOME MUTUALLY COOPERATIVE INSTEAD OF MUTUALLYEXCLUSIVE. WHEN HIS PRIVATE EGO AND CONSCIOUS EFFORTS YIELD TO A POWER NOT HISOWN HE THEN ACHIEVES THE SUPREME ACTION, NONACTION (WU WEI).ON WU-WEI (NONDOING)Image [../Images/127a.jpg]WU MEANS “NOT” OR “NON” AND WEI MEANS “ACTION,” “DOING,” “STRIVING,” “STRAINING”OR “BUSYNESS.” IT DOESN’T REALLY MEAN DOING NOTHING, BUT TO LET ONE’S MINDALONE, TRUSTING IT TO WORK BY ITSELF. WU WEI, IN GUNG FU, MEANS SPONTANEOUSACTION OR SPIRIT-ACTION, IN THE SENSE THAT THE GOVERNING FORCE IS THE MIND ANDNOT THAT OF THE SENSES. DURING SPARRING, A GUNG FU MAN LEARNS TO FORGET ABOUTHIMSELF AND FOLLOWS THE MOVEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT, LEAVING HIS MIND FREE TO MAKEIT’S OWN COUNTER-MOVEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTERFERING DELIBERATION. HE FREES HIMSELFFROM ALL MENTAL SUGGESTIONS OF RESISTANCE, AND ADOPTS A SUPPLE ATTITUDE. HISACTIONS ARE ALL PERFORMED WITHOUT SELF-ASSERTION; HE LETS HIS MIND REMAINSPONTANEOUS AND UNGRASPED. AS SOON AS HE STOPS TO THINK, HIS FLOW OF MOVEMENTWILL BE DISTURBED AND HE IS IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY HIS OPPONENT. EVERY ACTION,THEREFORE, HAS TO BE DONE “UNINTENTIONALLY” WITHOUT EVER TRYING.THROUGH WU WEI, A REPOSEFUL EASE IS SECURED. THIS PASSIVE ACHIEVEMENT, ASCHUANG-TZU POINTED OUT, WILL FREE A GUNG FU MAN FROM STRIVING AND STRAININGHIMSELF.Image [../Images/128a.jpg]A YIELDING WILL HAS A RESPOSEFUL EASE, SOFT AS DOWNY FEATHERS, A QUIETUDE, ASHRINKING FROM ACTION, AN APPEARANCE OF INABILITY TO DO. PLACIDLY FREE FROMANXIETY, ONE ACTS WITH THE OPPORTUNE TIME; ONE MOVES AND REVOLVES IN THE LINE OFCREATION. ONE DOES NOT MOVE AHEAD BUT RESPONDS TO THE FITTING INFLUENCES.ESTABLISH NOTHING IN REGARD TO ONESELF. LET THINGS BE WHAT THEY ARE, MOVE LIKEWATER, REST LIKE A MIRROR, RESPOND LIKE AN ECHO, PASS QUICKLY LIKE THENONEXISTENT AND BE QUIET AS PURITY. THOSE WHO GAIN, LOSE. DO NOT PRECEDE OTHERS,ALWAYS FOLLOW THEM.THE NATURAL PHENOMENON WHICH THE GUNG FU MAN SEES AS BEING THE CLOSESTRESEMBLANCE TO WU WEI IS WATER:> NOTHING IS WEAKER THAN WATER,> > BUT WHEN IT ATTACKS SOMETHING HARD,> > OR RESISTANT, THEN NOTHING WITHSTANDS IT,> > AND NOTHING WILL ALTER ITS WAY.Image [../Images/128b.jpg]THE ABOVE PASSAGES FROM THE TAO TE CHING ILLUSTRATE TO US THE NATURE OF WATER:WATER IS SO FINE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT; STRIKE IT, YETIT DOES NOT SUFFER HURT; STAB IT, AND IT IS NOT WOUNDED; SEVER IT, AND YET IT ISNOT DIVIDED. IT HAS NO SHAPE OF ITS OWN, BUT MOLDS ITSELF TO THE RECEPTACLE THATCONTAINS IT. WHEN HEATED TO THE STATE OF STEAM IT IS INVISIBLE, BUT HAS ENOUGHPOWER TO SPLIT THE EARTH ITSELF. WHEN FROZEN IT CRYSTALLIZES INTO A MIGHTY ROCK.FIRST IT IS TURBULENT LIKE THE NIAGARA FALLS, AND THEN CALM LIKE A STILL POND,FEARFUL LIKE A TORRENT, AND REFRESHING LIKE A SPRING ON A HOT SUMMER’S DAY. SOIS THE PRINCIPLE OF WU WEI:THE RIVERS AND SEAS ARE LORDS OF A HUNDRED VALLEYS. THIS IS BECAUSE THEIRSTRENGTH IS IN LOWLINESS; THEY ARE KINGS OF THEM ALL. SO IT IS THAT THE PERFECTMASTER WISHING TO LEAD THEM, HE FOLLOWS. THUS, THOUGH HE IS ABOVE THEM HEFOLLOWS. THUS, THOUGH HE IS ABOVE THEM, MEN DO NOT FEEL HIM TO BE AN INJURY. ANDSINCE HE WILL NOT STRIVE, NONE STRIVE WITH HIM.THE WORLD IS FULL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE SOMEBODY OR GIVE TROUBLE.THEY WANT TO GET AHEAD TO STAND OUT. SUCH AMBITION HAS NO USE FOR A GUNG FU MAN,WHO REJECTS ALL FORMS OF SELF-ASSERTIVENESS AND COMPETITION:ONE WHO TRIES TO STAND ON TIPTOE CANNOT STAND STILL. ONE WHO STRETCHES HIS LEGSTOO FAR CANNOT WALK. ONE WHO ADVERTISES HIMSELF TOO MUCH IS IGNORED. ONE WHO ISTOO INSISTENT ON HIS OWN VIEW FINDS FEW TO AGREE WITH HIM. ONE WHO CLAIMS TOOMUCH CREDIT DOES NOT GET EVEN WHAT HE DESERVES. ONE WHO IS TOO PROUD IS SOONHUMILIATED. THESE ARE CONDEMNED AS EXTREMES OF GREEDINESS AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVEACTIVITY.THEREFORE, ONE WHO ACTS NATURALLY AVOIDS SUCH EXTREMES.THOSE WHO KNOW DO NOT SPEAK;THOSE WHO SPEAK DO NOT KNOW.STOP YOUR SENSES: LET SHARP THINGS BE BLUNTED,TANGLES RESOLVED, THE LIGHT TEMPEREDAND TURMOIL SUBDUED;FOR THIS IS MYSTIC UNITY IN WHICH THE WISE MAN IS MOVEDNEITHER BY AFFECTION,NOR YET BY ESTRANGEMENTOR PROFIT OR LOSSOR HONOR OR SHAME.ACCORDINGLY, BY ALL THE WORLD,HE IS HELD HIGHEST.A GUNG FU MAN, IF HE IS REALLY GOOD, IS NOT PROUD AT ALL. PRIDE IS A SENSE OFWORTH WHICH DERIVES FROM SOMETHING THAT IS NOT ORGANICALLY PART OF ONESELF.PRIDE EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUPERIORITY OF ONE’S STATUS IN THE EYESOF OTHERS. THERE IS FEAR AND INSECURITY IN PRIDE BECAUSE WHEN ONE AIMS AT BEINGHIGHLY ESTEEMED, AND HAVING ACHIEVED SUCH STATUS, HE IS AUTOMATICALLY INVOLVEDIN THE FEAR OF LOSING HIS STATUS. THEN PROTECTION OF ONE’S STATUS APPEARS TO BEHIS MOST IMPORTANT NEED, AND THIS CREATES ANXIETY.THE LESS PROMISE AND POTENCY IN THE SELF, THE MORE IMPERATIVE IS THE NEED FORPRIDE. ONE IS PROUD WHEN HE IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH AN IMAGINARY SELF; THE COREOF PRIDE IS SELF-REJECTION.Image [../Images/130a.jpg]AS WE KNOW THAT GUNG FU IS AIMING AT SELF-CULTIVATION; AND, THEREFORE, THE INNERSELF IS ONE’S TRUE SELF; SO IN ORDER TO REALIZE HIS TRUE SELF, A GUNG FU MANLIVES WITHOUT BEING DEPENDENT UPON THE OPINION OF OTHERS. SINCE HE IS COMPLETELYSELF-SUFFICIENT HE CAN HAVE NO FEAR OF NOT BEING ESTEEMED. A GUNG FU MAN DEVOTESHIMSELF TO BEING SELF-SUFFICIENT, AND NEVER DEPENDS UPON THE EXTERNAL RATING BYOTHERS FOR HIS HAPPINESS. A GUNG FU MASTER, UNLIKE THE BEGINNER, HOLDS HIMSELFIN RESERVE, IS QUIET AND UNASSUMING, WITHOUT THE LEAST DESIRE TO SHOW OFF. UNDERTHE INFLUENCE OF GUNG FU TRAINING HIS PROFICIENCY BECOMES SPIRITUAL AND HEHIMSELF, GROWN EVER FREER THROUGH SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE, IS TRANSFORMED. TO HIM,FAME AND STATUS MEAN NOTHING.THUS WU WEI IS THE ART OF ARTLESSNESS, THE PRINCIPLE OF NO PRINCIPLE. TO STATEIT IN TERMS OF GUNG FU, THE GENUINE BEGINNER KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE WAY OFBLOCKING AND STRIKING, AND MUCH LESS OF HIS CONCERN FOR HIMSELF. WHEN ANOPPONENT TRIES TO STRIKE HIM, HE INSTINCTIVELY PARRIES IT. THIS IS ALL HE CANDO. BUT AS SOON AS HIS TRAINING STARTS, HE IS TAUGHT HOW TO DEFEND AND ATTACK,WHERE TO KEEP THE MIND, AND MANY OTHER TECHNICAL TRICKS—WHICH MAKES HIS MINDSTOP AT VARIOUS JUNCTURES. FOR THIS REASON WHENEVER HE TRIES TO STRIKE THEOPPONENT HE FEELS UNUSUALLY HAMPERED (HE HAS LOST ALTOGETHER THE ORIGINAL SENSEOF INNOCENCE AND FREEDOM). BUT AS MONTHS AND YEARS GO BY, AS HIS TRAININGACQUIRES FULLER MATURITY, HIS BODILY ATTITUDE AND HIS WAY OF MANAGING THETECHNIQUE MOVE TOWARD NO-MINDEDNES WHICH RESEMBLES THE STATE OF MIND HE HAD ATTHE VERY BEGINNING OF TRAINING WHEN HE KNEW NOTHING, WHEN HE WAS ALTOGETHERIGNORANT OF THE ART. THE BEGINNING AND THE END THUS TURN INTO NEXT-DOORNEIGHBORS. ON THE MUSICAL SCALE, ONE MAY START WITH THE LOWEST PITCH ANDGRADUALLY ASCEND TO THE HIGHEST. WHEN THE HIGHEST IS REACHED, ONE FINDS IT ISLOCATED NEXT TO THE LOWEST.IN A SIMILAR WAY, WHEN THE HIGHEST STAGE IS REACHED IN THE STUDY OF TAOISTTEACHING, A GUNG FU MAN TURNS INTO A KIND OF SIMPLETON WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF TAO,NOTHING OF ITS TEACHINGS, AND IS DEVOID OF ALL LEARNING. INTELLECTUALCALCULATIONS ARE LOST SIGHT OF AND A STATE OF NO-MINDEDNESS PREVAILS. WHEN THEULTIMATE PERFECTION IS ATTAINED, THE BODY AND LIMBS PERFORM BY THEMSELVES WHATIS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO DO WITH NO INTERFERENCE FROM THE MIND. THE TECHNICALSKILL IS SO AUTOMATIZED IT IS COMPLETELY DIVORCED FROM CONSCIOUS EFFORTS.ON EASTERN AND WESTERN HYGIENEImage [../Images/132a.jpg]THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHINESE HYGIENE AND THE WESTERN HYGIENE.SOME OF THE OBVIOUS ONES ARE THESE: CHINESE EXERCISES ARE RHYTHMIC, WHEREAS THEWESTERN ONES ARE DYNAMIC AND FULL OF TENSION; THE CHINESE EXERCISE SEEKS TOMERGE HARMONIOUSLY WITH NATURE, WESTERN EXERCISE SEEKS TO DOMINATE IT; THECHINESE EXERCISE IS BOTH A WAY OF LIFE AND MENTAL CULTIVATION, WHILE THE WESTERNEXERCISE IS MERELY A SPORT OR A PHYSICAL CALISTHENIC.PERHAPS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE FACT THAT THE CHINESE HYGIENE IS YIN(SOFTNESS), WHILE THE WESTERN HYGIENE IS YANG (HARDNESS). WE CAN COMPARE THEWESTERN MIND WITH AN OAK TREE THAT STANDS FIRM AND RIGID AGAINST THE STRONGWIND. WHEN THE WIND BECOMES STRONGER, THE OAK TREE CRACKS. THE CHINESE MIND, ONTHE OTHER HAND, IS LIKE THE BAMBOO THAT BENDS WITH THE STRONG WIND. WHEN THEWIND CEASES, THAT IS, WHEN IT GOES TO THE EXTREME AND CHANGES, THE BAMBOOSPRINGS BACK STRONGER THAN BEFORE.WESTERN HYGIENE IS A GRATUITOUS WASTE OF ENERGY. THE OVER-EXERTION ANDOVERDEVELOPMENT OF BODILY ORGANS INVOLVED IN WESTERN ATHLETICS IS DETRIMENTAL TOONE’S HEALTH. CHINESE HYGIENE, ON THE OTHER HAND, THROWS ITS EMPHASIS INCONSERVATION OF ENERGY; THE PRINCIPLE IS ALWAYS THAT OF MODERATION, AS OPPOSEDTO GOING TO EXTREMES. WHATEVER EXERCISE THERE MAY BE CONSISTS OF HARMONIOUSMOVEMENTS CALCULATED TO NORMALIZE BUT NOT TO EXCITE ONE’S BODILY REGIMEN.IT STARTS OUT WITH MENTAL REGIMEN AS A BASIS, OF WHICH THE SOLE OBJECT IS TOBRING ABOUT PEACE AND CALMNESS OF MIND. WITH THIS AS THE BASIS, IT AIMS ATSTIMULATING A NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERNAL PROCESS OF RESPIRATION ANDBLOOD CIRCULATION.A MOMENT OF UNDERSTANDINGImage [../Images/134a.jpg]GUNG FU IS A SPECIAL KIND OF SKILL; A FINE ART RATHER THAN JUST A PHYSICALEXERCISE. IT IS A SUBTLE ART OF MATCHING THE ESSENCE OF THE MIND TO THAT OF THETECHNIQUES IN WHICH IT HAS TO WORK. THE PRINCIPLE OF GUNG FU IS NOT A THING THATCAN BE LEARNED, LIKE A SCIENCE, BY FACT-FINDING AND INSTRUCTION IN FACTS. IT HASTO GROW SPONTANEOUSLY, LIKE A FLOWER, IN A MIND FREE FROM EMOTIONS AND DESIRES.THE CORE OF THIS PRINCIPLE OF GUNG FU IS TAO—THE SPONTANEITY OF THE UNIVERSE.AFTER FOUR YEARS OF HARD TRAINING IN THE ART OF GUNG FU, I BEGAN TO UNDERSTANDAND FELT THE PRINCIPLE OF GENTLENESS—THE ART OF NEUTRALIZING THE EFFECT OF THEOPPONENT’S EFFORT AND MINIMIZING THE EXPENDITURE OF ONE’S ENERGY. ALL THESE MUSTBE DONE IN CALMNESS AND WITHOUT STRIVING. IT SOUNDED SIMPLE, BUT IN ACTUALAPPLICATION IT WAS DIFFICULT. THE MOMENT I ENGAGED IN COMBAT WITH AN OPPONENT,MY MIND WAS COMPLETELY PERTURBED AND UNSTABLE. AND AFTER A SERIES OF EXCHANGINGBLOWS AND KICKS, ALL MY THEORY OF GENTLENESS WAS GONE. MY ONLY THOUGHT AT THISPOINT WAS “SOMEHOW OR OTHER I MUST BEAT HIM AND WIN!”MY INSTRUCTOR AT THE TIME, PROFESSOR YIP MAN, HEAD OF THE WING CHUN SCHOOL OFGUNG FU, WOULD COME UP TO ME AND SAY “LOONG, RELAX AND CALM YOUR MIND. FORGETABOUT YOURSELF AND FOLLOW THE OPPONENT’S MOVEMENT. LET YOUR MIND, THE BASICREALITY, DO THE COUNTER-MOVEMENT WITHOUT ANY INTERFERING DELIBERATION. ABOVEALL, LEARN THE ART OF DETACHMENT.”Image [../Images/135a.jpg]“THAT WAS IT!” I THOUGHT. “I MUST RELAX!” HOWEVER, RIGHT THEN I HAD JUST DONESOMETHING CONTRADICTORY AGAINST MY WILL. THAT OCCURRED AT THE PRECISE MOMENT ISAID “I” <+> “MUST” < − > “RELAX.” THE DEMAND FOR EFFORT IN “MUST” WAS ALREADYINCONSISTENT WITH THE EFFORTLESSNESS IN “RELAX.” WHEN MY ACUTESELF-CONSCIOUSNESS GREW TO WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGISTS REFER TO AS THE “DOUBLE-BIND”TYPE, MY INSTRUCTOR WOULD AGAIN APPROACH ME AND SAY “LOONG, PRESERVE YOURSELF BYFOLLOWING THE NATURAL BENDS OF THINGS AND DON’T INTERFERE. REMEMBER NEVER TOASSERT YOURSELF AGAINST NATURE; NEVER BE IN FRONTAL OPPOSITION TO ANY PROBLEMS,BUT TO CONTROL IT BY SWINGING WITH IT. DON’T PRACTICE THIS WEEK. GO HOME ANDTHINK ABOUT IT.”THE FOLLOWING WEEK I STAYED HOME. AFTER SPENDING MANY HOURS OF MEDITATION ANDPRACTICE, I GAVE UP AND WENT SAILING ALONE IN A JUNK. ON THE SEA I THOUGHT OFALL MY PAST TRAINING AND GOT MAD AT MYSELF AND PUNCHED THE WATER! RIGHT THEN—ATTHAT MOMENT—A THOUGHT SUDDENLY STRUCK ME; WAS NOT THIS WATER THE VERY ESSENCE OFGUNG FU? HADN’T THIS WATER JUST NOW ILLUSTRATED TO ME THE PRINCIPLE OF GUNG FU?I STRUCK IT BUT IT DID NOT SUFFER HURT. AGAIN I STRUCK IT WITH ALL OF MYMIGHT—YET IT WAS NOT WOUNDED! I THEN TRIED TO GRASP A HANDFUL OF IT BUT THISPROVED IMPOSSIBLE. THIS WATER, THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT COULDBE CONTAINED IN THE SMALLEST JAR, ONLY SEEMED WEAK. IN REALITY, IT COULDPENETRATE THE HARDEST SUBSTANCE IN THE WORLD. THAT WAS IT! I WANTED TO BE LIKETHE NATURE OF WATER.Image [../Images/136a.jpg]SUDDENLY A BIRD FLEW BY AND CAST IT’S REFLECTION ON THE WATER. RIGHT THEN AS IWAS ABSORBING MYSELF WITH THE LESSON OF THE WATER, ANOTHER MYSTIC SENSE OFHIDDEN MEANING REVEALED ITSELF TO ME; SHOULD NOT THE THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS I HADWHEN IN FRONT OF AN OPPONENT PASS LIKE THE REFLECTION OF THE BIRD FLYING OVERTHE WATER? THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT PROFESSOR YIP MEANT BY BEING DETACHED—NOT BEINGWITHOUT EMOTION OR FEELING, BUT BEING ONE IN WHOM FEELING WAS NOT STICKY ORBLOCKED. THEREFORE IN ORDER TO CONTROL MYSELF I MUST FIRST ACCEPT MYSELF BYGOING WITH AND NOT AGAINST MY NATURE.Image [../Images/136b.jpg]I LAY ON THE BOAT AND FELT THAT I HAD UNITED WITH TAO; I HAD BECOME ONE WITHNATURE. I JUST LAID THERE AND LET THE BOAT DRIFT FREELY ACCORDING TO ITS OWNWILL. FOR AT THAT MOMENT I HAD ACHIEVED A STATE OF INNER FEELING IN WHICHOPPOSITION HAD BECOME MUTUALLY COOPERATIVE INSTEAD OF MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE, INWHICH THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY CONFLICT IN MY MIND. THE WHOLE WORLD TO ME WAS ASONE.CENTERED THOUGHTS—SOME GUNG FU PRECEPTSImage [../Images/137a.jpg]THE ASSIMILATION OF THE TAO HAS ITS FOUNDATION IN MEEKNESS, TENDERNESS, POVERTYOF SPIRIT, AND QUIETNESS. THESE ARE EXPRESSED SOMETIMES BY ONE WORD, EMPTINESS.AN AGGRESSIVE SPIRIT WILL BE BROUGHT LOW, PRIDE LEADS TO A FALL, VIOLENCE WILLEND IN DEFEAT, ALL WHICH COME FROM MISUNDERSTANDING THE REAL USE OF TAO.QUIESCENCE AND NONACTIVITY; NOT SEEKING THE ACTUAL BUT TAKING THE EMPTY.IN STILLNESS AND QUIETNESS, WITHOUT STRIVING OR CRYING; NOT ALLOWING OUTSIDETHINGS TO ENTANGLE ONE’S MIND.OUTWARD CHANGE DOES NOT MOVE THE MIND—MOVE FORWARD IN HARMONY WITH THEFLUCTUATING MOVEMENTS OF THE COSMIC SPIRIT.THE YIELDING WILL HAS A REPOSEFUL EASE, SOFT AS DOWNY FEATHERS; A QUIETUDE, ASHRINKING FROM ACTION. AN APPEARANCE OF INABILITY TO DO (THE HEART IS HUMBLE,BUT THE WORK IS FORCEFUL). PLACIDITY FREE FROM ANXIETY, ONE ACTS IN HARMONY WITHNATURE; ONE MOVES AND REVOLVES IN THE LINE OF CREATION. ONE DOES NOT MOVE AHEADBUT RESPONDS TO THE FITTING INFLUENCE.HE THAT HUMBLES HIMSELF SHALL BE PRESERVED ENTIRE; HE THAT KEEPS BEHIND SHALL BEPUT IN FRONT; HE THAT BENDS SHALL BE MADE STRAIGHT.YIELDING WILL OVERCOME ANYTHING SUPERIOR TO ITSELF; ITS STRENGTH IS BOUNDLESS.THE HIGHEST SKILL OPERATES ON AN ALMOST UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL.WHO IS THERE THAT CAN MAKE MUDDY WATER CLEAR? BUT IF ALLOWED TO REMAIN STILL, ITWILL BECOME CLEAR OF ITSELF. WHO IS THERE THAT CAN SECURE A STATE OF ABSOLUTEREPOSE? BUT KEEP CALM AND LET TIME GO ON, AND THE STATE OF REPOSE WILL GRADUALLYARREST.GREATNESS OF YIELDING ILLUSTRATED BY WATER: NOTHING IN THE WORLD IS MOREYIELDING AND SOFTER THAN WATER; YET IT PENETRATES THE HARDEST. INSUBSTANTIAL, ITENTERS WHERE NO ROOM IS. IT IS SO FINE THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRASP A HANDFULOF IT; STRIKE IT, YET IT DOES NOT SUFFER HURT; STAB IT, AND IT IS NOT WOUNDED.> IF YOU TRY TO REMEMBER YOU WILL LOSE.> > EMPTY YOUR MIND, BE FORMLESS, SHAPELESS.

THIS MEANS THAT WE SHOULD DO NOTHING THAT IS NOT NATURAL ORSPONTANEOUS. THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO STRAIN IN ANY WAY. THIS IS BESTILLUSTRATED BY THE COOK, WHO HAS USED HIS KNIFE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND DIDN’T HAVETO REPLACE IT. FAMILIAR BY LONG HABIT WITH EACH BONE AND SINEW OF THE CARCASS TOBE CUT UP, THE COOK COULD ARREST HIS SIGHT AND OTHER SENSES AND WIELD THEWELL-TRIED CARVING KNIFE WITH HIS MIND, HIS METHOD BEING TO WORK ALONG AND NOTAGAINST THE VARIOUS PARTS, THUS FOLLOWING NATURE.UNITY OF MIND AND BODY DISCARDS ALL THOUGHTS OF REWARDS, ALL HOPES OF PRAISE ANDFEARS OF BLAME, ALL AWARENESS OF ONE’S BODILY SELF, AND FINALLY CLOSING THEAVENUES OF SENSE-PERCEPTION AND LETTING THE SPIRIT ACT AS IT WILL.EMPTINESS (NO MIND)A SUBTLE ART OF MATCHING THE ESSENCE OF THE MIND TO THAT OF THE MEDIUM IN WHICHIT WORKS.THE SECRET WAITS FOR THE INSIGHT.OF CLOUDS UNCLOUDED BY LONGING; THOSE WHO ARE BOUND BY DESIRE SEE ONLY THEOUTWARD CONTAINER.Image [../Images/140a.jpg]TAOBEFORE CONFUCIUS, THE TERM TAO USUALLY MEANT A ROAD, OR A WAY OF ACTION.CONFUCIUS USED IT AS A PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPT STANDING FOR THE RIGHT WAY OFACTION—MORAL, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL. THE TAOIST USED THE TERM TAO TO STAND FORTHE TOTALITY OF ALL THINGS, EQUIVALENT TO WHAT SOME PHILOSOPHERS HAVE CALLED“THE ABSOLUTE.”THE TAO WAS THE BASIC STUFF OUT OF WHICH ALL THINGS WERE MADE. IT WAS SIMPLE,FORMLESS, DESIRELESS, WITHOUT STRIVING, SUPREMELY CONTENT.ENDURANCE IS TO KEEP ONE’S PLACE.NOTHING SHOULD BE CONSCIOUSLY PLANNED.SPONTANEOUS ACTIONSPONTANEOUS ACTION—OF WHICH NATURE (TAO) WAS THE GRAND PRACTITIONER. THIS ACTIONOF NATURE WAS REAL ACTION. THE SECOND WAS ACTION TAKEN WITH DESIGN, PREMEDITATEDAND DIRECTED TO CHOSEN ENDS. THIS, HOWEVER ATTRACTIVE IT MIGHT SEEM, WAS AFORCING OF NATURE AND THEREFORE UNREAL.THAT MAN IN WHOM THE TRUTH IS BRIGHT HAS NO ANGER.BE STILL WHILE YOU WORK AND KEEP FULL CONTROL OVER ALL.TO KNOW, BUT TO BE AS THOUGH NOT KNOWING, IS THE HEIGHT OF WISDOM.THE STILLNESS IN STILLNESS IS NOT THE REAL STILLNESS; ONLY WHEN THERE ISSTILLNESS IN MOVEMENT DOES THE UNIVERSAL RHYTHM MANIFEST.FIRMNESS IS CONCEALED IN SOFTNESS; SOFTNESS IN FIRMNESS. ACTIVITY INCLUDESINACTIVITY; EACH BEING THE CAUSE OF THE OTHER.AVOID TRIALS OF SKILL; AT FIRST IT’S ALL FRIENDLINESS BUT IN THE END IT’S ALLANTAGONISM.TO DEFEND IS TO ATTACK, TO ATTACK IS TO DEFEND.FIRMNESS CANNOT BE FOR LONG, AND SOFTNESS CANNOT BE ALWAYS IN THE DEFENSIVE.IF YOU FEEL EMPTINESS, STRIKE IN A STRAIGHT LINE.Image [../Images/141a.jpg]SPARRINGIN SPARRING THE MIND MUST BE QUIET AND CALM; THE ATTENTION CONCENTRATED, AND THEENERGY LOWERED. BESIDES, STRAIGHTENING THE HEAD AND BODY, HOLLOWING THE CHEST,RAISING THE BACK, LOWERING THE SHOULDERS AND ELBOWS, LOOSENING THE WAIST,SETTING RIGHT THE SACRUM, AND KEEPING THE WAIST, LEGS, HANDS, AND OTHER PARTS OFTHE BODY IN PERFECT HARMONY ARE ALL IMPORTANT. THE POSTURES MUST BE NATURAL,CAPABLE OF STRETCHING AND DRAWING AS INTENDED WITHOUT ANY AWKWARD STRENGTH, ANDRESPONDING IMMEDIATELY AFTER SENSING.Image [../Images/142a.jpg]STRIKINGIN STRIKING, THE MOMENTUM OF THE WAIST AND LEGS, THE MOTIVATION AND THEINTRINSIC ENERGY MUST ALSO BE ADDED; THE HANDS ARE EMPLOYED ONLY AS A MEANS TOPUT IT THROUGH.ESTABLISH NOTHING IN REGARD TO ONESELF.

THERE IS NOOVERDOING AND NO INSUFFICIENCY; IT BENDS AND STRETCHES AS INTENDED. ITWITHSTANDS PROMPTLY WHEN ATTACKS ARE QUICK, AND IT FOLLOWS LEISURELY WHENATTACKS ARE SLOW. THE MOVEMENTS ARE EXACT IN POSITION, AND ARE INVISIBLE ATTIMES AND VISIBLE AT OTHERS. TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE LEFT MAKES THE LEFT WEAK,AND TOO MUCH ON THE RIGHT WEAKENS THE RIGHT. IT IS LOFTY WHEN IT RISES, AND ITIS DEEP WHEN IT FALLS. IT IS FAR AHEAD WHEN IT ADVANCES, AND PROMPT WHEN ITRETREATS. A FEATHER CANNOT BE ADDED, AND A FLY CANNOT BE PLACED.ONE HAS EASE OF MIND AND ABSORPTION IN ONE INTENTION, WITH NEITHER MOTIVES NORPRESENTIMENTS BUT AN OUTER LOOK OF EMPTINESS. SUCH IS THE WAY DURING PRACTICE BYYOURSELF.GIVE UP ALL THOUGHTS. SET YOUR EYES FORWARD, DIRECTED TO THE SPOT JUST IN FRONTOF THE OUTGOING HAND (IMAGINE THAT AN OPPONENT IS IN FRONT OF YOU). CLOSE YOURMOUTH AND BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE. PRESS YOUR TONGUE AGAINST YOUR PALATE. SETYOUR SHOULDERS DOWN, LOWER THE ELBOWS, STRAIGHTEN THE HEAD, HOLLOW YOUR CHESTAND RAISE YOUR BACK IN THE NATURAL WAY, LOOSEN THE WAIST WITH YOUR SACRUM RIGHTIN THE MIDDLE. DO NOT FORCE YOUR STRENGTH. RAISE YOUR SPIRIT AND BREATHE DOWNFROM THE PSYCHIC-CENTER (2½ INCHES UNDER THE NAVEL), SO THAT YOU MAY FEEL ATEASE IN EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY AND THE BLOOD MAY CIRCULATE SMOOTHLY. THE CHIEFMOVEMENTS ARE DONE WITH THE WAIST, RISING AND LOWERING ALTERNATELY LIKE WAVES.THE FOUR LIMBS AND ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY SHOULD CORRESPOND WITH EACHOTHER, AS MUSIC WITH RHYTHM. THE HAND MOVEMENTS ARE COMPOSED OF TWO KINDS: ONEOF YANG (SUBSTANTIALITY, FIRMNESS, POSITIVE, ETC.) AND ONE OF YIN(INSUBSTANTIALITY, SOFTNESS, NEGATIVE, ETC.). STEPS ARE LIGHT AND CHANGEABLELIKE THOSE OF A CAT, AND ALSO OF TWO CLASSES (YIN AND YANG). BE NATURAL AND INTHE RIGHT POSITION WHILE STANDING AND YOU WILL BE FILLED WITH SPIRIT AND ENERGY.YOU MUST WILL TO USE YOUR ENERGY.UNPERTURBED MIND.BE SOFT YET NOT YIELDING; STRONG YET NOT HARD.SELF-CULTURE—REDUCTION OF DESIRE; SUPPRESSION OF THE SENSES—GIVES POWER TOGOVERN THE MIND.TO SEE ONESELF IS TO BE CLEAR OF RIGHT. MIGHTY IS HE WHO CONQUERS HIMSELF.SIDEWAYS FORCE CAN BE BROKEN THOUGH BY STRAIGHT FORCE. STRAIGHT FORCE CAN BESTOPPED BY SIDEWAYS FORCE.FOOTWORK, HAND TECHNIQUE, AND BODY MOVEMENT; THESE THREE WAYS, IF PERFORMEDRIGHT, WILL FLOOR EVEN A GIANT.IF THERE IS FIRMNESS IN SOFTNESS, YOU CAN NEVER BREAK THROUGH; IF THERE IS NOSOFTNESS IN FIRMNESS, THEN IT IS NOT STRONG AT ALL.WHEN FACING AN OPPONENT YOUR EXPRESSION MUST BE LIKE A CAT READY TO GET A MOUSE.WHEN HE USES STRENGTH, I DON’T USE IT; WHEN HE DOESN’T USE IT, I USE INNERENERGY. IN OTHER WORDS, SOFTNESS FOR FIRMNESS AND FIRMNESS FOR SOFTNESS.WHEN YOU REACH A CERTAIN POINT, STOP AND DON’T GO ANY FURTHER. AFTER BENDING,STRETCH. FIT YOUR MOVEMENT INTO THAT OF YOUR OPPONENT. REMEMBER EVERY MOVEMENTSHOULD BE CONNECTED. ALTHOUGH OUTSIDE SEEMS LIKE IT’S STOPPED, INSIDE YOURENERGY MUST NOT STOP, YOUR MIND BEING AHEAD OF YOUR OPPONENT ALL THE TIME.IN THE MORNING, NEVER FACE EAST; AT NIGHT OR RATHER IN THE EVENING, NEVER FACEWEST.MOVE LIKE A WAVE, TURN LIKE A WHEEL, SLOW LIKE AN EAGLE, WALK LIKE A CAT, FASTAS LIGHTENING, JUMP UP LIKE A MONKEY, COME DOWN LIKE A BIRD, STAND LIKE A TREE,STOP SUDDENLY LIKE A COCK.THE DIVISION OF GUNG FU TECHNIQUESTHE GUNG FU TECHNIQUES ARE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO FOUR WAYS:1.

BUT IF MY OWN HEART TELLS ME THAT I AMRIGHT, I SHALL GO FORWARD EVEN AGAINST THOUSANDS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS.YOU ARE REQUIRED ONLY TO PERFORM YOUR OWN MISSION—WITHOUT ANY THOUGHTS OFAGGRESSIVENESS OR COMPETITION.

AMONG SOME OF THE WELL-KNOWN SCHOOLS ARE THE FOLLOWING:PA KUA, HSING-I, TANG LANG, YING JOW PAI, TAM TUI, NORTHERN SHAOLIN, LOHAN,MIZONG, HU CHUAN, CHA CHUAN, HOU CHUAN, WING CHUN, CHOW GA, LUNG YING MOSHIU,BAK HOK, NORTHERN SHAOLIN, CHOY LAY FUT, HUNG KUEN, CHOY GA, FUT GA, MOK GA, YALGUNG MOON, LEE GA, LAO GA, ETC.SOME OF THE STYLESCHOY LAY FUT GUNG FUCHOY LAY FUT WAS FOUNDED BY CHAN HEUNG IN KWANGTUNG PROVINCE. LIKE MANY OF THESOUTHERN CHINESE YOUTHS, HE WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO THE POPULAR SOUTHERN SHAOLINSTYLE OF HUNG KUEN BY HIS UNCLE. LATER ON, HE TRAINED WITH A LAY (OR LEE) YAUSAAN. STILL YEARNING FOR MORE KNOWLEDGE, HE WENT TO MT. LAW FOW AND SOUGHT OUTTHE MONK CHOY FOOK. BEFORE LONG, CHAN HEUNG WAS TO COMBINE ALL HIS LEARNING TOFORM HIS OWN STYLE, AND NAMED IT THE CHOY LAY FUT STYLE. TO HONOR HIS PREVIOUSINSTRUCTORS, HE NAMED HIS STYLE AFTER THEM. CHOY WAS NAMED AFTER MON CHOY FOOK,LAY, AFTER LAY YAU SAAN, AND FINALLY, BECAUSE HUNG KUEN IS ONE OF THE MANYBRANCHES OF THE SHAOLIN BUDDHIST TEMPLE, THE TERM FUT (BUDDHIST) IS ADOPTED.CHOY LAY FUT IS ESSENTIALLY A LONG-RANGE STYLE OF BOXING, RELYING ON A STRONG“HORSE” [STANCE], AND KNOWN FOR ITS JOINT-LOCKING TECHNIQUES, THE BACKFIST, THEDOWNWARD SWING, AND THE KNUCKLE FIST. THERE ARE MANY EMPTY-HAND SETS (FORMS) INTHIS SOUTHERN STYLE: THE LONG-RANGE FIST, BUDDHIST FIST, T’AI, PING, TEEN GOKFISTS, ETC. IN WEAPON SETS THERE ARE BAAT GWA LANCE, WILLOW LEAF, DOUBLE SWORDS,EIGHTEEN STAFF, ETC. AMONG THE MORE FAMOUS PRACTITIONERS OF THIS STYLE WERECHANG HUNG SING, THE LEADING DISCIPLE OF THE FOUNDER CHAN HEUNG. PRESENTLY, MANYOF THE CHOY LAY FUT TRAINING HALLS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS HUNG SING KWOON (KWOON =TRAINING HALL). CHANG’S OWN LEADING DISCIPLE, BY THE NAME OF CHAN SING, WASQUITE A POPULAR CHINESE BOXING INSTRUCTOR IN FUT SAAN OF SOUTHERN CHINA. TAMSAAM WAS ANOTHER ABLE CHOY LAY FUT PRACTITIONER.IRON FOREARM GUNG FUACCORDING TO THE TEACHERS OF THIS SYSTEM, IT IS VERY EASY TO MASTER. SIMPLY FINDA POLE OR COLUMN AND BEGIN HITTING IT WITH YOUR FOREARM VERY LIGHTLY. DO THISEVERY DAY, HITTING IT WITH ALL PARTS OF YOUR FOREARM—FRONT, BACK, AND SIDES.GRADUALLY, INCREASE YOUR STRIKING FORCE.Image [../Images/152a.jpg]EVENTUALLY YOU SHOULD VENTURE OUTSIDE AND FIND A TREE TO PRACTICE ON. THIS TREESHOULD HAVE LUMPY BARK ON IT. DO THIS FOR ONE YEAR. AFTER ONE YEAR, YOU SHOULDLOOK TO TRAIN ON VERY SMOOTH ROCKS. CONTINUE PRACTICING ON THE ROCKS UNTIL YOUCAN BREAK THEM WITH YOUR FOREARM. WHEN YOU CAN DO THIS, YOUR FOREARM WILL BE ASSTRONG AS IRON.PAPER TENT GUNG FUTHIS KIND OF GUNG FU IS TOTALLY CONCENTRATED ON THE FIST. ALTHOUGH CONSIDERED AHARD STYLE OF GUNG FU, IF YOU UNDERSTAND ITS ESSENCE, THEN YOU WILL REALIZE THATIT IS NOT ONLY A HARD STYLE OF GUNG FU, BUT RATHER AN INTERCHANGING OF THE HARDAND SOFT METHOD. IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PRACTICE, YOU SHOULD USE WASTE PAPERAND THIN STRING. TIE IT UP INTO A BUNDLE SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE A SMALL BAMBOOSUITCASE OR PICNIC BASKET. THE WIDTH AND LENGTH SHOULD BE A TWENTY-INCH CUBE.THE TWO SIDES SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY LONGER (MORE RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE). IN THECENTER FASTEN A LONG STRING TO BE USED AS A RETRIEVER. THIS ITEM IS CALLED “THEPAPER TENT.” PLACE THE PAPER TENT ON TOP OF A LONG TABLE. THIS TABLE SHOULDMEASURE ABOUT NINE FEET IN LENGTH BY TWO FEET. THE TRAINEE SHOULD BE AT ONE ENDOF THE TABLE, SITTING IN THE A SEMI-SQUATTING POSITION OR “BOWL HORSE” STANCE.WITH YOUR LEFT HAND PULLING ON THE STRING, MAKE A FIST WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND ANDAGGRESSIVELY STRIKE THE PAPER TENT. STRIKE OUT WITH YOUR FIST. IN THE BEGINNING,THE PAPER TENT WILL BARELY MOVE, BUT LATER ON IT WILL BE JUMPING OUTWARD. AFTERYOU STRIKE WITH YOUR FIST, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR LEFT HAND TO HOLD THE STRING ANDSTRIKE THE TENT WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND. CONTINUE ON WITH THIS PUNCH AND PULLMOTION UNTIL YOU ARE TIRED OUT, OR UNTIL THE LEFT AND RIGHT HAND HAVE LOST THEIRABILITY TO ACT IN A COORDINATED FASHION.START OUT USING WASTE PAPER (IT SHOULD WEIGH MORE THAN 20 CHINESE OUNCES). THEN,AS YOU PROGRESS, WRAP SOME LEAD WEIGHTS INSIDE UNTIL, OVER TIME, IT WEIGHS OVER100 OUNCES. AS THE WEIGHT OF THE PAPER TENT INCREASES, SO SHOULD THE PUNCHINGREPETITIONS AND, WHEN YOU’VE REACHED THE POINT WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NORESISTANCE—EVEN WITH THE WEIGHT INSIDE—AND YOUR COORDINATION DOES NOT FALTER SOTHAT YOU CAN RETURN THE PUNCH WITH EACH PULL—THEN YOU ARE MORE THAN HALFWAY TOACHIEVING SUCCESS IN THIS TYPE OF GUNG FU. THE STRENGTH OF THE PUNCHING FISTWILL BE AMAZINGLY INCREASED BY THIS METHOD, BUT THIS SHOULD BY NO MEANS BEVIEWED AS THE PEAK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. WHAT YOU SHOULD DO AT THIS POINT IS TOREMOVE SLABS OR LEAVES OUT OF THE CENTER OF THE TABLE, SO THAT THE PAPER TENTNOW HAS TO TRAVEL OVER A LARGE WHOLE WITHOUT FALLING THROUGH TO THE FLOOR. ATFIRST, YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO RETURN IT BACK AND FORTH SO EASILY, BUT SEVERALMONTHS LATER, YOU WILL ACHIEVE THE DESIRED EFFECT OF POPPING IT BACK AND FORTHWITHOUT IT FALLING THROUGH TO THE FLOOR. AT THIS POINT, REMOVE ANOTHER LEAF ORSECTION FROM THE TABLE AND CONTINUE ON WITH YOUR PRACTICE. EVENTUALLY, YOUSHOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE ALL OF THE SECTIONS FROM THE TABLE UNTIL YOU ONLY HAVEONE-THIRD OF THE ORIGINAL LENGTH OF THE TABLE REMAINING. AT THIS POINT THE PAPERTENT SHOULD FOLLOW THE FIST STRIKES AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TRAVELAERODYNAMICALLY BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT IT DROPPING THROUGH. AT THIS POINT YOUWILL HAVE MASTERED THIS EXERCISE AND CAN NOW MOVE ON TO TRYING YOUR SKILLAGAINST PEOPLE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE YOUR OPPONENT BACK OVER TEN CHINESEYARDS—OR MORE! AND IF I WERE TO FACE MULTIPLE OPPONENTS IN A FIGHT, I WOULDEMPLOY THIS METHOD OF ATTACK BECAUSE IT IS THE EASIEST WINNING MOVE. THIS TYPEOF GUNG FU IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YIN/YANG AS IT CONTAINS ELEMENTS OF YIN,WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO EFFECTIVE. IT’S FUNNY THAT THIS PAPER TENT HAND MOVEMENTDEFINITELY HAS JUST THE RIGHT BALANCE OF THE HARD AND SOFT COMPLEMENTING EACHOTHER.Image [../Images/154a.jpg]CHINESE WEAPONSGUNG FU INCLUDES TECHNIQUES OF HANDS, FEET, KNEES, ELBOWS, SHOULDERS, HEAD, ANDTHIGHS; THE THIRTY-SIX THROWS; THE SEVENTY-TWO JOINT LOCKS, AND THE EIGHTEENDIFFERENT WEAPONS. SWORDPLAY IS THE MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL ARTS IN GUNG FU. ITREQUIRES AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF HARD TRAINING TO BE A MASTER OF IT. THE SWORDMUST BE UNITED WITH THE MIND, AND BE USED AS THE LIMB OF THE BODY.Image [../Images/155a.jpg]Image [../Images/156a.jpg]Image [../Images/157a.jpg]MASTERS OF GUNG FU AND THEIR LEGENDSMASTER KUO YU CHEUNGMASTER KUO IS FROM KWONG SHO STATE, AND IS NOTED FOR HIS SPEAR PLAY AND HISSO-CALLED IRON PALMS.

MASTER KUO ALSO BROKE TWELVE BRICKS WITH A SLAP OF HIS PALM. MASTERKUO IS ADEPT IN BOTH OF THE SOFT (INTERNAL) AND FIRM (EXTERNAL) SCHOOLS OF GUNGFU. THE ABOVE DEMONSTRATION WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE INTERMEDIATE TECHNIQUE OF THESOFT SCHOOL. HERE THE INTERNAL (YIN) ENERGY IS USED.

HIS SON,NG KOON YEE, SUCCEEDED HIM AS THE PRESENT HEAD OF THE SCHOOL.Image [../Images/160a.jpg]MASTER FOCK YUEN KAP (FOUNDER OF THE JING MO GUNG FU INSTITUTE)MASTER FOCK WAS THE BEST GUNG FU MAN OF HIS TIME. HIS TECHNIQUE WAS AS LEGENDARYAS IT WAS TRUE. HE WAS THE FIRST IN THE PAST FOUR THOUSAND YEARS OF GUNG FUHISTORY TO ESTABLISH A GUNG FU INSTITUTE WHERE MANY SCHOOLS OF TECHNIQUES WERETAUGHT. THE JING MO INSTITUTES STILL FLOURISH ALL OVER CHINA. HE WAS FAMOUS AS APATRIOT, READY TO DEFEND HIS COUNTRY ANYTIME. MANY JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTISTS HADTANGLED WITH HIM, AND HE, HIMSELF, HAD CROSSED OVER SIBERIA WHERE HE KILLED THERUSSIAN WRESTLERS WITH A SINGLE BLOW. HE WAS CALLED BY THE FOREIGNERS THE“YELLOW-FACED TIGER.”Image [../Images/160b.jpg]PROFESSOR YIP MAN (LEADER OF THE WING CHUN SCHOOL)THE LAST MASTER OF THE WING CHUN SCHOOL IS PROFESSOR YIP, BORN IN FUT SAN INSOUTHERN CHINA. PROFESSOR YIP STARTED A STUDY OF THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS OF GUNG FUAT THE AGE OF EIGHT, UNTIL HE MET PROFESSOR CHAN WA SHUN AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTEDHIS FULL ENERGIES TO HIS ART, THE WING CHUN SCHOOL. NOW HE IS THE PRESENT LEADEROF THAT SCHOOL. PROFESSOR YIP IS TRULY A GUNG FU GREAT, AND IS RESPECTED BYOTHER INSTRUCTORS OF VARIOUS SCHOOLS. HE IS FAMOUS FOR HIS “STICKING HANDS,” INWHICH HE ATTACHES HIS HANDS TO THE OPPONENT AND SUBDUES HIM WITH HIS EYES SHUT!EVEN AT THE AGE OF SIXTY HE WAS STILL ACTIVE, AND NONE OF HIS STUDENTS COULDTOUCH HIM.Image [../Images/161a.jpg]PROFESSOR YANG KIN HOU (LEADER OF THE FAMOUS “YANG SCHOOL” OF T’AI KIK)PROFESSOR YANG, SON OF THE LATE YANG LO SIM, CHAMPION OF PEKING, WAS A GUNG FUGREAT. HE WAS KNOWN AS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT BY OTHER SCHOOLS’ INSTRUCTORS, ANDWITH A BAMBOO STICK HE COULD DISABLE ANY ARMED OPPONENT. HE COULD ALSO PLACE ABIRD ON HIS PALM, AND THE BIRD COULD NOT FLY AWAY. THIS FEAT PROVED HISSENSITIVITY OF FEELING IN THE DIRECTION OF STRENGTH. FOR AS SOON AS THE BIRD WASREADY TO SPRING AND FLY AWAY FROM HIS OPEN PALM, HE JUST SIMPLY DROPPED HIS PALMSLIGHTLY. PROFESSOR YANG DIED IN 1917.Image [../Images/162a.jpg]PROFESSOR YANG JING POMASTER YANG WAS THE SECOND SON OF PROFESSOR YANG KIN HOU. HIS TECHNIQUE WAS ALSOVERY FINE. OUTSIDE HE LOOKED GENTLE AND SOFT, BUT INSIDE WAS FIRM AS A ROCK. HELEFT THREE SONS; THE ELDEST IS YANG SHOU CHUNG WHO IS HEADING THE KIN MUN TAIKIK SCHOOL IN HONG KONG.Image [../Images/162b.jpg]A DISCUSSION ON CHINESE GUNG FU(WITH BRUCE LEE, JAMES Y. LEE, AND LEO FONG)Image [../Images/163a.jpg]QUESTION: FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INTERNAL SCHOOL ANDTHE EXTERNAL SCHOOL OF GUNG FU? THE SO-CALLED SOFT AND HARD STYLES?.BRUCE LEE: THE DIFFERENCE, LIKE ANY OTHER MARTIAL ART, IS IN THEIR APPROACH; ASTO THE SEPARATION OF SO-CALLED EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL, OR HARD AND SOFT, IT IS ANILLUSION. YOU SEE, IN REALITY, GENTLENESS/FIRMNESS IS ONE INSEPARABLE FORCE OFONE UNCEASING INTERPLAY OF MOVEMENT. TAKE A PERSON RIDING A BICYCLE: IF HEWISHES TO GO SOMEWHERE, HE CANNOT PUMP ON BOTH PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME OR NOTPUMP ON THEM AT ALL. IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD HE HAS TO PUMP ON ONE PEDAL ANDRELEASE THE OTHER. SO THE MOTION OF GOING FORWARD REQUIRES THIS “ONENESS” OFPUMPING AND RELEASING. PUMPING, THEN, IS THE RESULT OF RELEASING AND VICE VERSA,EACH BEING THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER. OF COURSE WE HEAR A LOT OF THETEACHERS CLAIMING THEIR STYLES ARE SOFT AND OTHERS ARE HARD; THESE PEOPLE ARECLINGING BLINDLY TO ONE PARTIAL VIEW OF THE TOTALITY. BECAUSE IF THEY HAVEUNDERSTOOD AND TRANSCENDED THE REAL MEANING OF GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS, THEYWOULDN’T HAVE MADE SUCH AN IMPOSSIBLE SEPARATION. I WAS ASKED BY A SO-CALLEDGUNG FU MASTER ONCE—ONE OF THOSE THAT REALLY LOOKED THE PART, WITH BEARD ANDALL—AS TO WHAT I THINK OF YIN (SOFT) AND YANG (FIRM). I SIMPLY ANSWERED“BALONEY!” OF COURSE, HE WAS QUITE SHOCKED AT MY ANSWER AND STILL HAS NOT COMETO THE REALIZATION THAT “IT” IS NEVER TWO.SO WE MUST REALIZE, THEN, THAT IT IS NOT A MATTER OF THE SOFT VERSUS THE FIRM,BECAUSE, AS I’VE POINTED OUT, THAT GENTLENESS AND FIRMNESS ARE ALWAYS AS A WHOLEAND ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL AS UNAVOIDABLY INTERDEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER.IF ONE REJECTS EITHER THE FIRM OR THE SOFT, THIS WILL LEAD TO SEPARATION, ANDSEPARATION WILL RUN TO EXTREMES. THOSE WHO CLING TO EITHER EXTREME ARE KNOWN ASEITHER PHYSICALLY BOUND OR INTELLECTUALLY BOUND, THOUGH THE FORMER ARE MOREBEARABLE. AT LEAST THE PHYSICALLY BOUND DO STRUGGLE.QUESTION: THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE STYLES OR SCHOOLS IN GUNG FU THAN INKARATE. COULD YOU TELL US HOW MANY—AND THE BASIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM?BRUCE LEE: THAT IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENTSTYLES; HOWEVER, LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. FUNDAMENTALLY, ALL STYLES CLAIM THATTHEIR METHOD IS ABLE TO COPE WITH “ALL” TYPES OF ATTACKS. THAT MEANS EACH ANDEVERY STYLE IS COMPLETE AND TOTAL. IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR STRUCTURE COVERS ALLPOSSIBLE LINES AND ANGLES, AS WELL AS BEING CAPABLE OF RETALIATING FROM ALLANGLES AND LINES. NOW, SINCE ALL POSSIBLE LINES AND ANGLES ARE COVERED, WHERECOME ALL THE “DIFFERENT” STYLES? TAKE WESTERN BOXING: DISREGARD WHETHER THEBOXER ASSUMES A CROUCH STANCE OR AN UPRIGHT STANCE, HANDS HELD HIGH OR LOW, HESTILL USES THE BASIC TOOLS OF THE JAB, HOOK, CROSS, UPPERCUT. THEY DO NOT HAVEFANCY TERMS FOR THOSE WHO CROUCH AS THE “TURTLE STYLE” OR FOR THOSE WHO STANDUPRIGHT AS THE “GIRAFFE STYLE.” AND DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT MARTIAL ARTIS DIFFERENT FROM BOXING. TRUE THAT THEY DO NOT USE KICKS OR ELBOWS, BUTBASICALLY AND ULTIMATELY ALL ARTS RETURN TO THE SAME TRUTH. I GUESS HE WHOCLAIMS HIS STYLE IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS MUST ASSUME HIS STANCE ONHIS HEAD, AND WHEN HE STRIKES HE MUST TURN AND SPIN THREE TIMES BEFORE DOING SO.AFTER ALL, HOW MANY WAYS ARE THERE TO COME IN ON AN OPPONENT WITHOUT DEVIATINGFROM THE NATURAL AND DIRECT PATH? BY “DIFFERENT” PROBABLY THESE INSTRUCTORS GOONLY FOR STRAIGHT LINES, OR MAYBE JUST ROUND LINES, OR MAYBE ONLY KICKING, ORMAYBE EVEN JUST “LOOKING DIFFERENT;” FLAPPING HERE AND FLICKING THERE. TO ME,STYLES THAT CLING TO ONE PARTIAL ASPECT OF COMBAT ARE ACTUALLY IN BONDAGE. YOUSEE, A CHOICE METHOD, HOWEVER EXACTING, FIXES ITS PRACTITIONERS IN AN ENCLOSEDPATTERN. I ALWAYS SAY THAT ACTUAL COMBAT IS NEVER FIXED, HAS NO BOUNDARIES ORLIMITS, AND IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT. BECAUSE ONE DOES NOTWANT TO BE MADE UNCERTAIN AND BE ENGAGED IN BROKEN RHYTHM, SO HE ESTABLISHES AFIXED PATTERN OF COMBAT, A COOPERATIVE PATTERN OF RHYTHMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH HISPARTNER. AS HIS MARGIN OF FREEDOM IS GETTING NARROWER AND NARROWER, HE BECOMES ASLAVE TO THE PATTERN AND ACCEPTS THE PATTERN TO BE THE REAL THING. SUCHEXCLUSIVE DRILLING ON A SET PATTERN OF ONE’S CHOICE WILL ONLY LEAD ITSPRACTITIONERS TO CLOGGINESS, BECAUSE BASICALLY IT IS A PRACTICE OF RESISTANCE.IN REALITY, THE WAY OF COMBAT IS NEVER BASED ON PERSONAL CHOICE AND FANCIES, ANDONE WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT HIS CHOICE ROUTINES LACK PLIABILITY AND AREINCAPABLE OF ADAPTING TO THE EVER-CHANGING SWIFT MOVEMENT OF COMBAT. ALL OF ASUDDEN HIS OPPONENT IS ALIVE AND NO LONGER A CO-OPERATIVE ROBOT. IN OTHER WORDS,ONCE CONDITIONED IN A PARTIALIZED STYLE, ITS PRACTITIONER FACES HIS OPPONENTTHROUGH A SCREEN OF RESISTANCE. IN REALITY, HE IS MERELY PERFORMING HIS STYLIZEDBLOCKS AND LISTENING TO HIS OWN SCREAMS.Image [../Images/165a.jpg]QUESTION: I UNDERSTAND FROM YOU THAT THERE ARE MORE PHONIES IN GUNG FU THANTHERE ARE IN OTHER ARTS. WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT WOULDLIKE TO TAKE UP THE ART?BRUCE LEE: MR. JAMES Y. LEE AND MR. LEO FONG HERE BOTH HAVE GONE THROUGH THEEXPERIENCE AND I THINK IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO THEM. BOTH HAVE SPENTQUITE A LONG TIME ON THE CHINESE ART AND MR. FONG IS ALSO A NI-DAN[SECOND-DEGREE BLACK BELT, IN TAE KWON DO] IN KOREAN KARATE.JAMES LEE: IT IS A SAD FACT THAT THERE IS AN ALARMING RATE OF SELF-STYLED“MASTERS” IN THE CHINESE ARTS. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TRAITS OF THE PHONIES ARETHE MYSTERIOUS TYPES, OR THE SO-CALLED HIDDEN POWER TYPES WHO STRIVE TO CONVINCETHE STUDENTS THAT, WHILE THEIR REGULAR PROGRAM IS JUST PLAIN OR ORDINARY INAPPEARANCE, ONCE THE STUDENT IS ACCEPTED, THEN—AND ONLY THEN—WILL THEIR HIDDENPOWERS BE REVEALED. ANYWAY, THE MASTERS OF THIS TYPE TRY TO CREATE AN ATMOSPHEREOF MYSTICISM AND HUMBLENESS. TO THEM THIS HUMILITY AND MYSTICISM SERVES TO GETTHE IDEA ACROSS OF BEING A MASTER DISGUISED IN MEEKNESS. OF COURSE, AS ALWAYS,THESE MASTERS ARE NEVER SEEN IN FREESTYLE SPARRING—“SPARRING IS TOO DANGEROUS”OR “WE ARE NOT UNSOPHISTICATED STREET FIGHTERS,” ETC. IN FACT, IF THEIR STUDENTSSIT DOWN AND THINK, THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE NEVER REALLY SEEN THEIRMASTERS DO ANYTHING CONVINCING ALONG THE LINES OF ACTUAL COMBAT. IN OTHER WORDS,THE “HIDDEN POWER” IS JUST THAT, ALWAYS HIDDEN AWAY!LEO FONG: THEN THERE ARE THOSE TYPES BETTER KNOWN AS THE “CHOP SUEY” MASTERS.THESE MASTERS KNOW PRACTICALLY ALL THE FORMS AND SETS OF THE SO-CALLED NORTHERNAND SOUTHERN STYLES, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS, OF COURSE, INCLUDING ALL THEWEAPON SETS. IN FACT, ONCE THERE IS A NEW GUNG FU BOOK PUBLISHED EITHER IN HONGKONG, FORMOSA [TAIWAN], OR RED CHINA, AND IF THEY CAN GET A HAND ON IT, IT WILLBE INCLUDED IN THEIR SYSTEMS. SOME OF THESE MASTERS ARE SO BRILLIANT, THEY CANMIX THE MOVEMENTS ALL UP WITH FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT FORMS. OF COURSE, ALL FORMSAND NO FREESTYLE SPARRING.JAMES LEE: TALKING ABOUT FREESTYLE SPARRING, THIS ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE LACKINGWITH MOST OF THE SELF-STYLED PHONIES. MR. BRUCE LEE APTLY PUT IT THIS WAY; HESAYS “WHEN A RUNNER GIVES A DEMONSTRATION, HE RUNS. WHEN A SWIMMER GIVES ADEMONSTRATION, HE SWIMS. WHEN A BOXER GIVES A DEMONSTRATION, HE SPARS. NOW WHENA “PROFESSOR” OR “MASTER” GIVES A DEMONSTRATION, HE . . . ?” WELL, ANYWAY, THENEXT GROUP IS THE GIMMICK PERFORMERS. SINCE THEY WILL NEVER SPAR, THEY HAVE TOSUBSTITUTE THE REAL THING WITH SOME CIRCUS ACTS AND SHOW THE AUDIENCE THEIRINTERNAL POWER BY BREAKING THINGS OR HAVE THINGS BROKEN ON THEIR BODIES.Image [../Images/167a.jpg]BRUCE LEE: MANY OF THESE SELF-STYLED MASTERS WHO HAVE BEEN PREACHING THEIRDOCTRINES FOR MANY YEARS HAVE GAINED SOME SURFACE KNOWLEDGE AND SOME ESTABLISHEDSALES PITCH. THIS IS QUITE UNFORTUNATE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CONFUSED BUTSINCERE IN WANTING TO LEARN GUNG FU. THIS INCLUDES BLACK BELTERS FROM VARIOUSMARTIAL ART SYSTEMS. YOU SEE, MOST OF THESE CONFUSED SOULS ARE SEEKING FORSOMETHING HIGHER, SOMETHING MORE COMPLEX. SO THEY BEGIN TO LEARN MORE ADVANCEDFORMS THAT ARE “DIFFERENT” (EFFICIENCY IS NO LONGER A CONCERN HERE) FROM WHATTHEY HAVE SEEN. THE END IS EFFICIENCY IN BROKEN RHYTHM SPARRING, BUT THEMEANS—THE WAY-OUT FORMS—ARE BEING DRILLED UPON EVERY DAY. AS THE FORMS BECOMELESS AND LESS REAL, THE PRACTITIONERS DRIFT FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THEEND—THE REALITY OF MARTIAL ART. FINALLY, ALL THEIR EFFORTS WILL HAVE TOCONCENTRATE ON THE MEANS AND THE END IS FORGOTTEN. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ANUNRELATED STANDARD OF JUDGMENT IS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE SYSTEMS, LIKE “THEHORSE STANCE IS NOT FIRM AND FLAT,” OR “THE ENERGY IS NOT APPLIED CORRECTLY,”ETC. IN SHORT, EVEN THOUGH ONE MIGHT GET KNOCKED DOWN AND OUT, WHEN HE COMES TO,HE WILL PROBABLY SAY SOMETHING LIKE “YEAH, BUT HE WAS OFF-BALANCE WHEN HE HITME, HIS HEEL WAS UP, HIS HAND WAS NOT ON THE HIP, ETC., ETC., ETC. REALLY, IFONE APPROACHES THESE “PROFESSORS” WITH COMMON SENSE, HE IS SELDOM WRONG. INOTHER WORDS, ONE SHOULD EVALUATE AN INSTRUCTOR AS TO HIS BASIC REQUIREMENTS INAN ALL-OUT COMBAT, AND NOT ON HIS SHOWING HIM A FORM OR A MOVEMENT OR TWO.RANKS, IF THEY HAVE THEM, ARE NOT IMPORTANT AS COMPARED TO HIS ACTUAL ABILITY,NOR IS LOOKING BEAUTIFUL AS COMPARED TO HIS EFFICIENCY. REALLY, IF ONE ISEFFICIENT, HIS FORM WILL BE A DELIGHT, BUT A BEAUTIFUL FORM DOES NOT MAKE ANEFFICIENT FIGHTER.Image [../Images/168a.jpg]QUESTION: WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DEMONSTRATIONS WHEREIN THE DEMONSTRATOR ALLOWSPEOPLE TO PUSH HIM ON THE ARM AND THEY CANNOT MOVE HIM OR TO HAVE PEOPLE PUNCHHIM ON THE STOMACH. WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT ON THIS?BRUCE LEE: THIS IS REALLY STRANGE. I MEAN, YOU WILL NEVER SEE A WESTERN BOXERDEMONSTRATE WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID. YOU SEE, A WESTERN BOXER IS PRIMARILY AFIGHTER AND, WHEN HE DEMONSTRATES, HE SPARS. ANYWAY, FIRST OF ALL, IN A FIGHT,AN ATTACKER WILL THROW PUNCHES AND KICKS AT YOU, HE WON’T PUSH YOU. ALSO, WHYSPEND YEARS OF TRAINING ON THE STOMACH TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A FULL-FORCE PUNCH INTHAT REGION—ONLY TO BE BLINDED BY A MERE FINGER JAB? TRUE, STOMACH EXERCISES AREVITAL, BUT DOES A STRONG STOMACH MEAN A GOOD MARTIAL ARTIST? I HOPE THEPRACTITIONERS WILL CONCENTRATE ON THE ESSENTIALS INSTEAD OF FOOLING AROUND WITHGIMMICKS. THE ESSENTIALS ARE BROKEN RHYTHM, SPARRING, AND EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES.Image [../Images/168b.jpg]NOTE: JAMES Y. LEE WAS A CLOSE FRIEND AND STUDENT OF BRUCE LEE FROM 1959 UNTILHIS DEATH IN DECEMBER OF 1972. HE AND BRUCE HAD A SCHOOL IN OAKLAND IN 1964,WHICH JAMES CONTINUED TO OPERATE AFTER BRUCE HAD GONE TO LOS ANGELES. JAMES HADAN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN MARTIAL ART BEFORE HE MET BRUCE, BUT UPON THEIRMEETING HE BECAME AN AVID FOLLOWER OF BRUCE’S.LEO FONG IS A PRACTITIONER OF GUNG FU FROM SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, AND WAS ATTIMES A STUDENT OF BRUCE’S.THE QUESTION OF PSYCHIC CENTERImage [../Images/169a.jpg]DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF GUNG FU INSTRUCTORS TEACH THEIR STUDENTS TO KEEP THEIR MINDIN THE PSYCHIC CENTER (DAN T’IEN); LOCATED TWO-AND-A-HALF OR SOMETIMESONE-AND-A-HALF INCHES BELOW THE NAVEL. THE METHOD IS TO BREATHE DEEPLY DOWN TOTHIS LOWER REGION OF THE ABDOMEN; THIS WILL ENABLE YOU TO LOWER THE CENTER OFGRAVITY AND BE FAST IN SHIFTING FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER. IT IS ALSOBELIEVED THAT TREMENDOUS PSYCHIC POWER WILL BE GENERATED FROM SUCH PRACTICE.THIS IS FINE FOR THE BEGINNER, BUT TO THE GUNG FU MASTER (ALSO THE TAOIST OR ZENMASTERS), WHAT IS HIGHEST IS NOTHINGNESS.THE MIND (IF THERE IS SUCH A THING) SHOULD PERVADE AND FILL UP THE WHOLE BODYAND FLOW FREELY THROUGHOUT. THE SO-CALLED MIND SHOULD BE ALL-EMBRACING; IT ISHERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE. IF YOU IMPRISON YOUR MIND IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN,EVERY OTHER PART OF THE BODY WILL FEEL ITS ABSENCE. WHAT IS MORE IS THE FACTTHAT IF YOU CAN LOCALIZE THE MIND IN THE LOWER ABDOMEN, WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE ITEXTRA TIME AND ENERGY ARE WASTED IN TRYING TO MANEUVER THE MIND FROM THIS LOWERABDOMEN TO THE NEEDED PART. THE GUNG FU MASTER BELIEVES IN A UNITY INMULTIPLICITY AND A WHOLENESS OF PARTS. WHAT I RECOMMEND IS TO FORGET ABOUT THISPARTIALITY OF LOCALIZING THE MIND TO ANYWHERE. IN FACT, FORGET ABOUT THE MIND;WHEN YOU HAVE NO CONCERN OF THE MIND, IT WILL START TO OPEN UP AND BECOME READYTO RESPOND FREELY TO ANY SITUATION. IT CAN DO THIS BECAUSE THE MIND IS NOTATTACHED OR CONFINED (A STATE OF WU-HSIN).WHEN THE MIND IS NOT CONFINED ANYWHERE, IT IS EVERYWHERE. DID YOU KNOW THAT ACENTIPEDE WAS WALKING ALONG NICELY WHEN ANOTHER BUG STOPPED HIM TO FIND OUT HOWHE MANAGED TO WALK WITH HUNDREDS OF LEGS? WELL, THE CENTIPEDE STOPPED AND BEGANTO CONSCIOUSLY DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF HIS WALKING. AND DO YOU KNOW WHATHAPPENED? THE CENTIPEDE FELL FLAT ON HIS FACE.MY VIEW ON GUNG FUImage [../Images/170a.jpg]SOME INSTRUCTORS OF MARTIAL ART FAVOR FORMS, THE MORE COMPLEX AND FANCY THEBETTER. SOME, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE OBSESSED WITH SUPER MENTAL POWER (LIKECAPTAIN MARVEL OR SUPERMAN). STILL SOME FAVOR DEFORMED HANDS AND LEGS, ANDDEVOTE THEIR TIME TO FIGHTING BRICKS, STONES, BOARDS, ETC.TO ME, THE EXTRAORDINARY ASPECT OF GUNG FU LIES IN ITS SIMPLICITY. GUNG FU ISSIMPLY THE DIRECT EXPRESSION OF ONE’S FEELING WITH THE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTS ANDENERGY. EVERY MOVEMENT IS BEING SO OF ITSELF WITHOUT THE ARTIFICIALITIES WITHWHICH PEOPLE TEND TO COMPLICATE IT. THE EASY WAY IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT WAY, ANDGUNG FU IS NOTHING AT ALL SPECIAL; THE CLOSER TO THE TRUE WAY OF GUNG FU, THELESS WASTAGE OF EXPRESSION THERE IS.INSTEAD OF FACING COMBAT IN ITS SUCHNESS, QUITE A FEW SYSTEMS OF MARTIAL ARTACCUMULATE “FANCINESS” THAT DISTORTS AND CRAMPS THEIR PRACTITIONERS ANDDISTRACTS THEM FROM THE ACTUAL REALITY OF COMBAT, WHICH IS SIMPLE AND DIRECT ANDNONCLASSICAL. INSTEAD OF GOING IMMEDIATELY TO THE HEART OF THINGS, FLOWERY FORMSAND ARTIFICIAL TECHNIQUES (ORGANIZED DESPAIR!) ARE RITUALLY PRACTICED TOSIMULATE ACTUAL COMBAT. THUS, INSTEAD OF BEING IN COMBAT, THESE PRACTITIONERSARE IDEALISTICALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT COMBAT.WORSE STILL, “SUPER MENTAL THIS” AND “SPIRITUAL THAT” ARE IGNORANTLYINCORPORATED UNTIL THESE PRACTITIONERS ARE DRIFTING SO MUCH FURTHER AND FURTHERINTO THE DISTANCE OF ABSTRACTION AND MYSTERY THAT WHAT THEY’RE DOING RESEMBLESANYTHING (FROM ACROBATICS TO MODERN DANCING) BUT THE ACTUAL REALITY OF COMBAT.ALL THESE COMPLEXITIES ARE ACTUALLY FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO ARREST AND FIX THEEVER-CHANGING MOVEMENTS IN COMBAT AND TO DISSECT AND ANALYZE THEM LIKE A CORPSE.REAL COMBAT IS NOT FIXED AND IS VERY MUCH ALIVE. SUCH MEANS OF PRACTICE (A FORMOF PARALYSIS) WILL ONLY SOLIDIFY AND CONDITION WHAT WAS ONCE FLUID AND ALIVE.WHEN YOU GET OFF SOPHISTICATION AND WHATNOT, AND LOOK AT IT REALISTICALLY, THESEROBOTS (PRACTITIONERS, THAT IS) ARE BLINDLY DEVOTED TO THE SYSTEMATICUSELESSNESS OF PRACTICING ROUTINES OR STUNTS THAT LEAD NOWHERE.GUNG FU IS TO BE LOOKED AT WITHOUT FANCY SUITS AND MATCHING TIES, AND IT WILLREMAIN A SECRET WHEN WE ANXIOUSLY LOOK FOR SOPHISTICATION AND “DEADLY”TECHNIQUES. IF THERE ARE REALLY ANY SECRETS AT ALL, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN MISSEDBY THE SEEKING AND STRIVING OF ITS PRACTITIONERS (AFTER ALL, HOW MANY WAYS ARETHERE TO COME IN ON AN OPPONENT WITHOUT DEVIATING TOO MUCH FROM THE NATURALCOURSE?). TRUE GUNG FU VALUES THE WONDER OF THE ORDINARY, AND THE CULTIVATION OFGUNG FU IS NOT DAILY INCREASE, BUT DAILY DECREASE. BEING WISE IN GUNG FU DOESNOT MEAN ADDING MORE, BUT TO BE ABLE TO GET OFF WITH ORNAMENTATION AND BE SIMPLYSIMPLE—LIKE A SCULPTOR BUILDING A STATUE, NOT BY ADDING BUT BY HACKING AWAY THEUNESSENTIAL SO THAT THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED UNOBSTRUCTED. IN SHORT, GUNG FUIS SATISFIED WITH ONE’S BARE HAND WITHOUT THE FANCY DECORATION OF COLORFULGLOVES WHICH TEND TO HINDER THE NATURAL FUNCTION OF THE HAND.ART IS THE EXPRESSION OF THE SELF. THE MORE COMPLICATED AND RESTRICTIVE A METHODIS, THE LESSER THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXPRESSION OF ONE’S ORIGINAL SENSE OFFREEDOM! THE TECHNIQUES, THOUGH THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EARLY STAGE,SHOULD NOT BE TOO RESTRICTIVE, COMPLEX, OR MECHANICAL. IF WE CLING TO THEM WEWILL BECOME BOUND BY THEIR LIMITATIONS. REMEMBER, YOU ARE EXPRESSING THETECHNIQUE AND NOT DOING THE TECHNIQUE. WHEN SOMEONE ATTACKS YOU IT IS NOTTECHNIQUE NUMBER ONE (OR IS IT TECHNIQUE NUMBER TWO, STANCE TWO, SECTION FOUR?)THAT YOU ARE DOING, BUT THE MOMENT YOU BECOME AWARE OF HIS ATTACK YOU SIMPLYMOVE IN LIKE SOUND AND ECHO WITHOUT ANY DELIBERATION. IT IS AS THOUGH WHEN ICALL YOU, YOU ANSWER ME OR WHEN I THROW SOMETHING TO YOU, YOU CATCH IT, THAT’SALL.WHAT IT ALL ADDS UP TOImage [../Images/172a.jpg]BEFORE I STUDIED THE ART, A PUNCH TO ME IS JUST LIKE A PUNCH, A KICK JUST LIKE AKICK. AFTER I’VE STUDIED THE ART, A PUNCH IS NO LONGER A PUNCH, A KICK NO LONGERA KICK. NOW THAT I’VE UNDERSTOOD THE ART, A PUNCH IS JUST LIKE A PUNCH, A KICKJUST LIKE A KICK.THERE IS NOTHING MUCH IN THIS ART. TAKE THINGS AS THEY ARE. PUNCH WHEN YOU HAVETO PUNCH. KICK WHEN YOU HAVE TO KICK.NOT BEING TENSE BUT READY, NOT THINKING BUT NOT DREAMING, NOT BEING SET BUTFLEXIBLE—IT IS BEING WHOLLY AND QUIETLY ALIVE, AWARE AND ALERT, READY FORWHATEVER MAY COME.THE HEIGHT OF CULTIVATION RUNS TO SIMPLICITY. HALFWAY CULTIVATION LEADS TOORNAMENTATION.IT’S NOT DAILY INCREASE BUT DAILY DECREASE—HACK AWAY THE UNESSENTIAL!WOULD THAT WE COULD AT ONCE STRIKE WITH THE EYES! IN THE LONG WAY FROM THE EYETHROUGH THE ARM TO THE FIST, HOW MUCH [TIME] IS LOST!Image [../Images/173a.jpg]PLEASE DO NOT DISREGARD YOUR FIVE NATURAL SENSES TO RELY ON A SO-CALLED SIXTH!I’M MOVING AND NOT MOVING AT ALL. I’M LIKE THE MOON’S REFLECTION UPON THE WAVESTHAT EVER GOES ON ROLLING AND ROCKING.GIVE UP THINKING AS THOUGH NOT GIVING IT UP. OBSERVE THE TECHNIQUES AS THOUGHNOT OBSERVING.TO CHANGE WITH CHANGE IS THE CHANGELESS STATE.THE STILLNESS IN STILLNESS IS NOT THE REAL STILLNESS, ONLY WHEN THERE ISSTILLNESS IN MOVEMENT DOES THE UNIVERSAL RHYTHM MANIFEST.NOTHINGNESS CANNOT BE CONFINED; THE SOFTEST THING CANNOT BE SNAPPED.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSImage [../Images/174a.jpg]Image [../Images/174b.jpg]ADVICE TO WOMENQUESTION: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A WOMAN WHO IS FORCED TO DEFEND HERSELFAGAINST A BIG, POWERFUL BRUTE?BRUCE LEE: THE TROUBLE IS THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MUST DICTATE WHAT YOU DO. BUT TOOMANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT IS FROM A POSITION OF THINKING WHAT SHOULD BE.HOWEVER, I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE HEARD, THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS A 90-POUNDWEAKLING TOSSING A 250-POUND GIANT. AND IF A 90-POUND WOMAN IS ATTACKED, THEONLY THING SHE CAN DO IS STRIKE HARD AT ONE OF THREE PLACES—THE EYEBALLS, THEGROIN, OR THE SHINS. THIS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT SELF-DEFENSE TO PUT THE MAN OFFBALANCE FOR JUST A MOMENT. AND THEN SHE’D BETTER RUN LIKE HELL.MORE ON DEFINITIONSQUESTION: YOU HAVE MENTIONED THAT GUNG FU GOES BY MANY DIFFERENT NAMES. CAN YOULIST SOME OF THEM AND ALSO GIVE A DEFINITION OF GUNG FU THAT IS COMMON TO ALLSTYLES?Image [../Images/175a.jpg]BRUCE LEE: GUNG FU, THE PREVALENT TERM NOW USED IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS QUITEA FEW OTHER NAMES. IN CHINA, FORMOSA, AND HONG KONG, GUNG FU IS CALLED KUO SHUOR KUO CHI; WHILE IN JAPAN, IT IS KNOWN AS KEMPO. HISTORICALLY, THE NAME OFCHUEN YUNG WAS FIRST FOUND IN THE BOOK OF POETRY AND THE FOLLOWING CHART WILLSHOW THAT IN DIFFERENT DYNASTIES, GUNG FU TOOK ON A DIFFERENT TERM.CHUEN YUNG—THE BOOK OF POETRYWU NI—CHUN CHIU ERACHI CHI—CHAN KUO ERACHI CHIAO—HAN DYNASTYSHOU PO—HAN DYNASTYKUNG SHOU—NI DYNASTYCHI YUNG—MING DYNASTYCHI NI—MING DYNASTYPAI SHOU—CHING DYNASTYWU SHU—CHINESE REPUBLICKUO SHU—CHINESE REPUBLICKUO CHI—CHINESE REPUBLICTHE TWO WORDS GUNG FU MEAN ACCUMULATION OF WORK OR TRAINING. HOWEVER, IN THESENSE OF MARTIAL ART, IT MEANS TRAINING AND DISCIPLINE TOWARD THE TAO OF ANOBJECT—BE IT THE TAO OF HEALTH PROMOTION, THE TAO OF CULTIVATION OF MIND, OR THETAO OF SELF-PROTECTION.THE “BEST” WAY TO LEARNQUESTION: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR A PERSON TO LEARN CHINESE GUNG FU?BRUCE LEE: BY BEING HIMSELF. THE MAIN THING IS TEACHING A MAN TO DO HIS THING,TO JUST BE HIMSELF. THE INDIVIDUAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE STYLE. IF A PERSONIS AWKWARD, HE SHOULD NOT TRY TO BE AGILE. I’M AGAINST TRYING TO IMPOSE A STYLEON A MAN. THIS IS AN ART, AN EXPRESSION OF A MAN’S OWN SELF.Image [../Images/176a.jpg]DO WE NEED MORE THAN BASICS?QUESTION: I AM TRAINING WITH A CHINESE INSTRUCTOR WHO DRILLS US AGAIN AND AGAINON BASICS—LIKE SIDE KICKS, STRAIGHT PUNCHING, ETC. WHEN WE SPAR, WE AREINSTRUCTED TO USE ONLY HIS CHOSEN BASIC TECHNIQUES, THOUGH SOMETIMES WE CAN USECOMBINATIONS AND EVERYTHING. DO YOU NOT THINK WE NEED VARIETY?BRUCE LEE: THE BEST TECHNIQUES ARE THE SIMPLE ONES DONE CORRECTLY. AND INMARTIAL ART, IT IS NOT HOW MUCH YOU HAVE LEARNED, BUT HOW MUCH YOU HAVE ABSORBEDIN WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED. AS LONG AS THE BASICS ARE ON MEANINGFUL MEANS THATWILL LEAD TO THE ULTIMATE END OF ACTUAL APPLICATION IN BROKEN RHYTHM, THEY ARENEVER WASTED. EFFICIENT BASICS ARE LIKE THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF A HOUSE. OFCOURSE, ONE MUST AVOID BASICS THAT HAVE THE “ALIVENESS” TAKEN OUT OF THEM ANDARE “PERFORMED” IN RHYTHMIC ROUTINES. HAVE PATIENCE, MY FRIEND. I’M SURE YOURTEACHER KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING.ON THE NEED FOR BELTS IN THE MARTIAL ARTSQUESTION: MOST PROFICIENT KARATE PEOPLE HAVE BLACK BELTS. SOME REALLY ADVANCEDMASTERS HAVE RED BELTS. YOU’VE BEEN CALLED A MASTER OF MARTIAL ART, SO WHATCOLOR BELT DO YOU HAVE?BRUCE LEE: I DON’T HAVE ANY BELT WHATSOEVER. THAT IS JUST A CERTIFICATE. UNLESSYOU CAN REALLY DO IT—THAT IS, DEFEND YOURSELF SUCCESSFULLY IN A FIGHT—THAT BELTDOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING. I THINK IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HOLD YOUR PANTS UP, BUTTHAT’S ABOUT IT.THE PROBLEM WITH BLACK BELTSQUESTION: YOU SEEM DOWN ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF BLACK-BELT RANKINGS. WHY IS THIS?BRUCE LEE: THERE SIMPLY ISN’T TIME IN A MAN’S LIFE—IF HE WERE TO TRAIN THEPROPER ORIENTAL WAY—TO RECEIVE SUCH AN HONOR. IF ORIENTALS CAN’T EARN IT, SURELYAMERICANS WHO PRACTICE ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A WEEK CAN’T. I’M VERY MUCH AGAINSTTHIS “BECOME A HOLY TERROR IN THREE EASY LESSONS” MENTALITY.THE NATURAL VERSUS THE SUPERNATURALQUESTION: SOME MARTIAL ARTISTS INDICATE THE “TRUE MASTERS” OF THEIR VARIOUSSTYLES HAVE DEVELOPED AN “INNER” SPIRITUAL TYPE OF GUNG FU THAT ENABLES THEM TOPERFORM INCREDIBLE, ALMOST SUPERNATURAL FEATS SUCH AS BEING IMPERVIOUS TO SWORDSAND KNIVES. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS KIND OF THING IS REAL?BRUCE LEE: I THINK TO BE A REALLY GOOD MARTIAL ARTIST ONE ALREADY HAS MANYTHINGS TO LEARN IN THIS LIFE, SO WHY SHOULD A PERSON LEARN THAT? THEREFORE, IREALLY DON’T HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THIS “SUPERNATURAL” GUNG FU. IF YOU ASK MEWHAT I WILL DO IN HEAVEN, I WILL SAY THIS: “THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THIS LIFE IHAVE NOT FINISHED. WHY SHOULD I THINK ABOUT SOMETHING SO FAR AWAY?” MOREOVER, ITHINK THAT THOSE WHO TRUST IN THIS “SPIRIT-POSSESSED” POWER HAVE A VESTEDINTEREST IN DOING SO. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY TRUST IN SOMETHING SO UNSCIENTIFIC? IDO NOT THINK, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT A MAN WILL NOT HURT HIMSELF WHEN HE FALLS FROMTHE TWELFTH FLOOR OF A BUILDING—REGARDLESS OF HOW PROFICIENT HE MAY BE IN HISPARTICULAR STYLE OF GUNG FU. I ALSO DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A MAN’S FLESH ISIMPERVIOUS TO SWORDS AND KNIVES.THE NATURE OF WATERQUESTION: COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GLASS OF WATER AS ITAPPLIES TO GUNG FU?BRUCE LEE: WELL, ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF GUNG FU IS A GLASS OF WATER. WHY?BECAUSE IT IS CAPABLE OF ADAPTING ITSELF TO ANY SITUATION. IF YOU POUR IT INTO ACUP, IT BECOMES THE CUP; IF YOU POUR IT INTO A BOTTLE, IT BECOMES THE BOTTLE; IFYOU POUR IT INTO A GLASS, IT BECOMES THE GLASS. WATER IS THE SOFTEST SUBSTANCEIN THE WORLD, YET IT CAN PENETRATE THE HARDEST ROCK. WATER IS ALSOINSUBSTANTIAL; BY THAT I MEAN, YOU CANNOT GRASP HOLD OF IT, YOU CANNOT PUNCH ITAND HURT IT. SO EVERY GUNG FU MAN IS TRYING TO DO THAT; TO BE SOFT LIKE WATER,TO BE FLEXIBLE AND ABLE TO ADAPT HIMSELF TO THE OPPONENT.Image [../Images/178a.jpg]GUNG FU VERSUS JUJITSUQUESTION: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUJITSU, WHICH SEEMS TO BE RATHER LONGAND INVOLVED, AND GUNG FU, WHICH IS VERY QUICK, IF YOU HAVE AN OPPONENT?BRUCE LEE: SOMETIMES YOU WILL READ IN A BOOK OR IN A MARTIAL ARTS MAGAZINE, THATWHEN SOMEBODY GRABS YOU, YOU ARE TOLD TO “FIRST DO THIS, AND THEN THIS, ANDTHEN, AND THEN, AND THEN, AND THEN”—THOUSANDS OF STEPS BEFORE YOU DO A SINGLETHING. OF COURSE, THESE KINDS OF MAGAZINES WOULD TEACH YOU TO BE “FEARED BY YOURENEMIES AND ADMIRED BY YOUR FRIENDS” AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN BETWEEN. BUT IN GUNGFU, IT ALWAYS INVOLVES A VERY FAST MOTION. FOR INSTANCE, IF A GUY GRABS YOURHAND, IT’S NOT THE IDEA IN GUNG FU TO DO SO MANY STEPS. RATHER YOU SHOULD SIMPLYSTOMP YOUR OPPONENT RIGHT ON THE INSTEP—HE’LL LET GO. THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN BY“SIMPLICITY.” THE SAME THING APPLIES IN STRIKING; IT HAS TO BE BASED ON A VERYMINIMUM MOTION SO THAT EVERYTHING CAN BE DIRECTLY EXPRESSED IN ONEMOTION—BOOM!—AND HE’S GONE. DOING IT GRACEFULLY.MORE ON WU WEIQUESTION: WHY IS WU-WEI SO IMPORTANT IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING A BETTER MARTIALARTIST?BRUCE LEE: THE PRINCIPLE OF WU-WEI IS ENTIRELY AN ACTION OF CREATIVE INTUITION,WHICH OPENS THE WELLSPRINGS WITHIN MAN. WHILE THE ACTION OF ASSERTION, MAN’SCOMMON TENDENCY, IS PRECONCEPTUAL AND RATIONAL, IT CANNOT PENETRATE THE HIDDENRECESSES OF CREATIVITY. THE ACTION OF ASSERTION IS VIEWED FROM THE EXTERNALS OFINTELLECTION, WHILE THE ACTION OF NONASSERTION IS ACTIVATED BY THE INNER LIGHT.THE FORMER ACTION IS LIMITED AND FINITE, THE LATTER FREE AND LIMITLESS.WU WEI AND CHI SAOQUESTION: I’M STILL NOT SURE HOW WU WEI TIES INTO THE PRACTICE OF CHI SAO ORSTICKING HANDS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN?BRUCE LEE: THE UNDERSTANDING OF CHI SAO IS AN INNER EXPERIENCE IN WHICH THEDISTINCTION BETWEEN SELF AND OPPONENT VANISHES. IT IS AN INTUITIVE, IMMEDIATEAWARENESS RATHER THAN A MEDIATED, INFERENTIAL, OR INTELLECTUAL PROCESS.THE RISE OF GUNG FUQUESTION: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT GUNG FU IS BECOMING SO POPULAR THESE DAYS?BRUCE LEE: THE ART OF GUNG FU IS GAINING POPULARITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG THECOLLEGE STUDENTS, FOR IT IS NOT MERELY SOME FIGHTING TRICKS OR BRICK-BREAKINGSTUNTS, BUT IT IS A PHILOSOPHICAL ART OF SELF-DEFENSE THAT HAS 4,000 YEARS OFREFINEMENT IN IT. ALSO, ITS THEORY IS LOGICAL AND ITS APPLICATION IS PRACTICAL.IN ADDITION, GUNG FU SERVES TO CULTIVATE THE MIND, TO PROMOTE HEALTH, AND TOPROVIDE A MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF SELF-PROTECTION AGAINST ANY ATTACKS.ADDITIONALLY, GUNG FU IS COMPARATIVELY NONSTRENUOUS, AND SERVES TO NORMALIZEINSTEAD OF OVERDEVELOPING OR OVEREXERTING THE BODY. HOWEVER, ABOVE ALL ELSE,GUNG FU DEVELOPS CONFIDENCE, HUMILITY, COORDINATION, ADAPTABILITY, AND RESPECTTOWARD OTHERS.THE BASIC THEORY BEHIND GUNG FUQUESTION: WHAT IS THE BASIC THEORY BEHIND GUNG FU?BRUCE LEE: WELL, THE BASIC IDEA IS SIMPLY TO “FIT” HARMONIOUSLY INTO YOUROPPONENT’S MOVEMENT LIKE THE IMMEDIACY OF THE SHADOW ADJUSTING ITSELF TO THEMOVING BODY. INSTEAD OF OPPOSITION, THERE IS COOPERATION. IT IS LIKE A PLIABLEREED THAT NEITHER OPPOSES NOR GIVES WAY IN THE WIND. EVERY MOVEMENT IN GUNG FUHAS A FLOWING CONTINUITY WITHOUT ANY DISLOCATION. DEFENSE IS ATTACK, ATTACK ISDEFENSE, EACH BEING THE CAUSE AND RESULT OF THE OTHER. ITS TECHNIQUES ARESMOOTH, SHORT, AND EXTREMELY FAST; THEY ARE DIRECT, TO THE POINT, AND ARESTRIPPED DOWN TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSES WITHOUT ANY WASTED MOTIONS. SIMPLICITYIS THE KEY WORD IN THIS ART—TO DO THE UTMOST IN THE MINIMUM OF MOTION ANDENERGY. THE METHOD OF GUNG FU PARALLELS THAT OF THE FLOW OF WATER, AS RUNNINGWATER NEVER GROWS STALE.Image [../Images/180a.jpg]APPLYING THE CENTERLINE AND BODY WEIGHT THEORIES TO JUDOQUESTION: I’M QUITE TAKEN WITH YOUR THEORIES REGARDING THE CENTERLINE AND ALSOPUTTING ALL OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT INTO YOUR STRIKES INSTEAD OF SIMPLY ARM POWER.HOWEVER, I’M A JUDOKA—NOT A GUNG FU MAN—AND WE USE THROWS RATHER THAN STRIKES.DOES THIS RENDER THESE PRINCIPLES INVALID?Image [../Images/181a.jpg]BRUCE LEE: NOT AT ALL. IT IS MOST INTERESTING TO WORK ON THE COORDINATION OF ARMAND BODY FOR THAT WILL MAKE A JUDOKA ABLE TO EXERT TWICE (PERHAPS TRIPLE) HISPOWER AND A GUNG FU MAN TO STRIKE HIS BODY WEIGHT. USING ARM FORCE ALONE ISINDEED CHARACTERISTIC OF THE UNTRAINED PERSON (IN FACT, A LOT OF INSTRUCTORS AREPRACTITIONERS OF THIS) AND SINCE STRIKING IS MAINLY USED IN GUNG FU, I’LLDISCUSS THE RELATIONSHIP OF ARM POWER AND BODY POWER (WAIST OR HIP MOVEMENT) INA PUNCH. I’M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE A SIMILAR BASIC SOURCE AS IN THROWING. ITWILL FACILITATE THE ANALYSIS OF PUTTING IN THE WAIST WITH THE ARM BY DIVIDINGTHE HUMAN BODY INTO TWO HALVES WITH AN IMAGINARY CENTERLINE AS IN FIGURE ONE[../Text/Part4.xhtml#fig180].* FIGURE TWO [../Text/Part4.xhtml#fig181]* SHOWS APERSON RELEASING HIS RIGHT SIDE AND PROPELLING HIS BODY WEIGHT (AS IN ANORDINARY RIGHT-HAND PUNCH) BY BRACING HIMSELF ON HIS LEFT FOOT THAT ACTS AS THEHINGE AROUND WHICH HIS RIGHT SIDE BODY WEIGHT AND POWER ROTATES. THE HIP ANDSHOULDER ARE DRIVEN FIRST TO THE IMAGINARY CENTERLINE THEN THE ARM COMES INTOPLAY “EXPLOSIVELY.” THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO TRANSFER THE WEIGHT TO THE OPPONENT’STARGET AREA BEFORE THE WEIGHT TRANSFERS TO THE LEFT LEG. THAT IS ALSO WHY INSTEPPING IN TO STRIKE, THE LEADING FOOT SHOULD NOT LAND FIRST, OR THE BODYWEIGHT WILL REST UPON THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF BEING BEHIND THE STRIKING HAND. OFCOURSE, ALL THESE ARE CO-ORDINATED VERY, VERY FAST, BUT THE WAIST REVERSE DOESCOME A SPLIT SECOND FASTER. IF YOU MANIPULATE THIS IMAGINARY CENTERLINE IT MIGHTEVOLVE SOME NEW ANGLE FOR YOUR JUDO ANALYSIS.FROM THIS CENTERLINE I WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A NUCLEUS AND LATER ON ABLE TO JUMPAWAY FROM THE NUCLEUS AND ESTABLISH OUT-OF-LINE AND BROKEN-RHYTHM COUNTERATTACK.BY THE WAY, EMPHASIS MUST BE MADE TO THE STUDENTS TO THROW WITH THEIR BODYBECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IN TERMS OF FORCE AND POWER, THE ARMS HAVE BUT ONEQUARTER OF THE FORCE OF THE BODY WHEN SET IN MOTION. SECONDLY, THE MOVEMENTS OFTHE WAIST ARE LONG AND FREE WHILE THOSE OF THE ARMS ARE SHORT. YOU CAN SAY THATONE TURNING OF A LARGE AXIS IS EQUIVALENT TO MANY TURNINGS OF A SMALL AXIS. THEARMS EXERT MAXIMUM STRENGTH TOWARD THE END OF THE MOVEMENT—THEREFORE, THE ARMSARE THE VEHICLE OF FORCE THAT IS RELEASED BY THE BODY THROUGH THIS CENTERLINEIDEA. BOXING ALSO MAKES USE OF THIS CENTERLINE BUSINESS BUT EXPRESSES IT IN TOOBIG A MOTION. IT IS ALL RIGHT AT FIRST BUT LATER ON IT SHOULD BE GUIDED BY THEPRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY—TO EXPRESS THE UTMOST IN THE MINIMUM OF MOVEMENTS ANDENERGY. HOWEVER, IN TERMS OF JUDO, THE MOVEMENTS CAN BE A LITTLE LARGER THAN INGUNG FU BECAUSE JUDO DOESN’T INVOLVE STRIKING AND COUNTER-STRIKING. IF I WERE TOWORK ON JUDO I’D MAKE USE OF THIS CENTERLINE (I HAVEN’T REALLY WORKED ON IT—ONTOP OF THAT I HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT) AND CLASSIFY THE ATTACKS INJUDO SOMETHING LIKE:> 1. DIRECT ATTACK—QUICK AND POWERFUL, ONE ACTION DRIVES IN TO THROW OPPONENT.> > 2. COMBINATION ATTACK—TO COMBINE TWO OR THREE THROWS IN A ROW TO DISTURB THE> OPPONENT’S RHYTHM.> > 3. INDIRECT ATTACK—TO USE FALSE ATTACK TO DRAW A REACTION FROM THE OPPONENT> AND MAKE USE OF THIS REACTION FOR YOUR THROW—SEEMS LIKE THIS FIELD IS RARELY> USED IN ORIENTAL SYSTEMS. EVERYTHING STARTS FROM IMMOBILE TO MOBILE. FEINTS> AND WHAT NOT, IF DONE IN A THREATENING MANNER, CAN DISTURB EVEN A CALM AND> COOL OPERATOR.> > 4. ATTACK BY DRAWING—APPARENT OPENING TO OPPONENT AND COUNTER HIS ATTACK TO> IT.Image [../Images/183a.jpg]THERE ARE MORE THAN THAT I’M SURE, BUT IN ORDER TO BUILD ON IT, ONE HAS TO JUMPOUT FROM THE CLASSICAL RIGIDITY AND SEE THE FIELD IN A MORE PRACTICAL LIGHT—ASWEIGHT TRAINING (NOT BODYBUILDING) HAS CONTRIBUTED TO JUDO.IN CONCLUSIONImage [../Images/184a.jpg]IN CONCLUSION I SINCERELY GIVE THIS ADVICE TO ALL READERS WHO ARE ABOUT TO TAKEUP MARTIAL ART—BELIEVE ONLY HALF OF WHAT YOU SEE AND DEFINITELY NOTHING THAT YOUHEAR. BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY LESSONS FROM ANY INSTRUCTOR, FIND OUT CLEARLY FROM HIMWHAT HIS METHOD IS AND REQUEST HIM POLITELY TO DEMONSTRATE TO YOU HOW SOMETECHNIQUES OPERATE. USE YOUR COMMON SENSE AND IF HE CONVINCES YOU, THEN BY ALLMEANS GO AHEAD.HOW DOES ONE JUDGE IF AN INSTRUCTOR IS GOOD? RATHER, THIS QUESTION SHOULD BEREPHRASED TO HOW CAN ONE JUDGE IF A METHOD OR SYSTEM IS GOOD. AFTER ALL, ONECANNOT LEARN THE SPEED OR POWER OF AN INSTRUCTOR, BUT RATHER HIS SKILL. THUS,THE SOUNDNESS OF THE SYSTEM, AND NOT THE INSTRUCTOR, IS TO BE CONSIDERED; THEINSTRUCTOR IS MERELY THERE TO POINT THE WAY AND LEAD HIS DISCIPLES TO ANAWARENESS THAT HE HIMSELF IS THE ONE AND ONLY ONE TO GIVE TRUE FEELING ANDEXPRESSION TO THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE MECHANICAL AND COMPLICATEDBUT SIMPLY SIMPLE, WITH NO “MAGICAL POWER.” THE METHOD (WHICH IS ULTIMATELY NOMETHOD) IS THERE TO REMIND ONE WHEN HE HAS DONE ENOUGH. THE TECHNIQUES HAVE NOMAGICAL POWER AND ARE NOTHING SPECIAL; THEY ARE MERELY THE SIMPLICITY OFPROFOUND COMMON SENSE.DO NOT, HOWEVER, BE IMPRESSED BY INSTRUCTORS WHO HAVE BRICK-BREAKING HANDS,INVINCIBLE STOMACHS, IRON FOREARMS, OR EVEN SPEED FOR THAT MATTER. REMEMBER YOUCANNOT LEARN HIS ABILITY, BUT HIS SKILL. AT ANY RATE, ABILITY TO BREAK STONES,TO TAKE A PUNCH ON THE BODY, TO JUMP SO MANY FEET OFF THE GROUND, ARE BUT STUNTSIN THE CHINESE ART OF GUNG FU. OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE ARE THE TECHNIQUES.BREAKING A BRICK AND PUNCHING A HUMAN BEING ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS: A BRICKDOES NOT GIVE, WHEREAS WHEN BEING HIT, A HUMAN BEING SPINS, FALLS, ETC., THUSDISSOLVING THE POWER OF THE BLOW. WHAT IS THE USE IF ONE HAS NO TECHNIQUE TOBRING HOME HIS SO-CALLED KILLING STROKE? ON TOP OF THAT, BRICKS AND STONES DONOT MOVE AND FIGHT BACK. THUS, THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE THE THING CONSIDERED AND, ASMENTIONED BEFORE, A SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE MECHANICAL, INTRICATE, AND FANCIFUL,BUT SIMPLY SIMPLE.WHAT IF THE “MASTER” DOES NOT WISH TO SHOW YOU HIS STYLE? WHAT IF HE IS “TOOHUMBLE” AND FIRMLY GUARDS HIS “DEADLY” SECRET? ONE THING I HOPE THE READERSSHOULD REALIZE REGARDING ORIENTAL HUMILITY AND SECRECY IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT ISTRUE THAT HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS DO NOT BOAST AND SOMETIMES DO NOT TEACH GUNGFU TO JUST ANYBODY, THE FACT REMAINS THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN BEINGS ANDCERTAINLY THEY HAVE NOT SPENT TEN, TWENTY, OR THIRTY YEARS ON AN ART IN ORDER TOSAY NOTHING ABOUT IT. EVEN LAO-TZU, THE AUTHOR OF THE TAO TE CHING, AND THE MANWHO WROTE “HE WHO KNOWS DOES NOT SPEAK. HE WHO SPEAKS, DOES NOT KNOW,” WROTE5,000 WORDS TO EXPLAIN HIS DOCTRINE.IN ORDER TO PASS FOR MORE THAN THEIR ABILITY, THE SO-CALLED HONORABLE MASTERS,PROFESSORS, AND EXPERTS (IN AMERICA, ESPECIALLY) SAY LITTLE. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE“MASTERED” THE HIGHEST WAY OF “ORIENTAL HUMILITY” AND “SECRECY,” FOR IT ISDEFINITELY EASIER TO LOOK WISE THAN TO TALK WISELY. (TO ACT WISE IS, OF COURSE,EVEN MORE DIFFICULT.) THE MORE THEY WANT TO BE TAKEN AT A VALUE ABOVE THEIR TRUEWORTH, THE MORE THEY WILL KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT. FOR ONCE THEY TALK (OR MOVE),PEOPLE CAN CERTAINLY CLASSIFY AND ASSESS THEM ACCORDINGLY.I REALIZE THAT THE UNKNOWN IS ALWAYS WONDERFUL AND THE “FIFTEENTH-DEGREERED-BELT HOLDERS,” THE “EXPERTS FROM SUPER-ADVANCED SCHOOLS,” AND THE “HONORABLEMASTERS” KNOW HOW TO GATHER AROUND THEMSELVES A MYSTERIOUS VEIL OF SECRECY.HOWEVER, KEEP IN MIND A CHINESE SAYING THAT APPLIES TO THESE PEOPLE: “SILENCE ISTHE ORNAMENT AND SAFEGUARD OF THE IGNORANT.”MAY IT BE WELL WITH YOU.FOOTNOTE* FIGURES ONE AND TWO ARE FOUND ON PAGE 41 [../Text/Part2.xhtml#page41]."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX IBRUCE LEE’S GUNG FU BACKGROUND AT THE TIME HE WROTE THIS BOOK (C. 1959-1964)> 1.
