According to Ulema Rajani, time is not linear. And because space bendson itself, therefore, events don’t have a chronology or time-sequences. “Thingsand events happen on the net of the cosmos. When your mind perceives them, theyhappen before your eyes. But in fact, they have already happened before yourhave noticed them.This applies to all future and forthcoming events, because also they haveoccurred on another cosmos net parallel to the one that have contained separateevents. It is a matter of perception, rather than observation or taking notice…”said Ulema Govinda. Abgaru : Balance; equilibrium.Balance does not mean a physical balance, but a position or a situation whereand when a person maintains a perfect vision, assimilation and understanding ofthe limits, dimensions and length of objects surrounding him/her.In other words, it is sensing and remembering the exact position of objects thatcan expand within the area where we are standing or walking, even in the dark.Objects are not limited by their physical dimension, and/or the physical placethey occupy.“Almost all objects extend and expand outside what it defines their measurement,shape, and size, because they have inertia “Energy” rays or vibrations thatconstantly emanate from them, thus occupying an extra physical place. Not tobump into the vibes area is maintaining balance,” said Ulema W. Li. Afik-r’-Tanawar: . Enlightenment through the development of the mind. Composedof two words;> • a -Afik-r, which means mind.> • b- Tanawar, which means the act of enlightenment. The Anunnaki have created us on earth to serve their needs.Their intentions were to create a race that could carry heavy physical load anddo intense physical labor.This was their initial and prime objective. Thus, the “Naphsiya” (DNA) they putin us had limited lifespan, and mental faculties.Later on, they discovered that they had to prolong the human lifespan and addmore developed mental faculties, so they added the Hara-Kiya (Internal energy orphysical strength). Few generations later, the early human beings stock evolves considerably,because the Anunnaki geneticists added a fully operational mind in the humanbody. To do so, they installed a Conduit with limited capabilities. In the sametime, this Conduit was also installed into the prototype of the human body.Thus, through the mind, the physical body of the humans got linked to theDouble.This non-physical link created a Fourth dimension for all of us.In fact, it did not create a Fourth dimension per se, rather it activated it.So now, at that stage, humans had a physical dimension (Life on earth), andnot-a-totally separated non-physical dimension called Nafis-Ra.So, the Bashar (Humans) became destined to acquire two dimensions, as exactlythe Anunnaki decided. Later on, centuries upon centuries, the human mind beganto evolve, because the other mind, call it now the Double or prototype began toevolve simultaneously and in sync.The more the prototype is advanced the more the “Physical Mind” becomes alert,creative and multidimensional. But we are not trapped, and our mind is no longerconditioned by the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki gave us all the choices,opportunities, freewill and freedom to learn on our own and progress. This iswhy we are accountable and responsible for everything we do and think about.Because of the evolution of our mind, and realization of an inner knowledge ofour surroundings, and understanding what is right and what is wrong, a majormental faculty emerged in all of us: Conscience. Anšekadu-ra abra “Anshekadoora-abra”: Learning by traveling or traversing otherdimensions.Composed of four words:> • a- Anše, which means magnificent.> • b -Kadu, which means ability, or to be able.> • c -Ra, which means heavenly; godly.> • d -Abra, which means to cross over; to traverse.Ulema Shimon Naphtali Ben Yacob and Ulema de Lafayette explained that theAnunnaki have acquired an enormous amount of knowledge by entering differentdimensions, and visiting multiple universes.These dimensions are sometimes called parallel universes, future universes, andvibrational spheres.He said: “Some are physical/organic, others are purely mental. There arebillions and billions of universes. Some are inhabited by beings, super-beings,multi-vibrational beings, and even negative entities known to mankind as demonsand evils. Planet earth is considered the lowest organic and human life-form inthe universe. The human beings are the less developed living entities, bothmentally and spiritually.”Anšekadu-ra abra also means Anunnaki’s branching out and changing individualityin multiple universes . To understand the concept, consider this scenario saidUlema Mordachai Ben Zvi: “Let say, you wish if you could do somethingdifferently in your life, something like changing the past, changing a majorlife decision you have madesome years ago, like perhaps, going back in time to a point before you have madea bad decision. Or for instance, you wish if you could do something really goodby changing an entire event that has happened in your past. In the Anunnaki’scase, they have the solutions for these dilemmas. They can go back and forth intime and space, including the past, the future, and meta-future.An Anunnaki can split himself/herself in two, three, or more if necessary, andmove on to a universe that is very much like the one they live on (Nibiru), ortotally different. There are so many universes, and some of them do not resembleNibiru at all. If an Anunnaki wishes to branch out and move on, he/she muststudy the matter very carefully and make the right selection. And the branching,or splitting, results in exact copies of the person of the Anunnaki, bothphysically and mentally.At the moment of separation, each separate individual copy of an Anunnaki grows,mentally, in a different direction, follows his or her own free will anddecisions, and eventually the two are not exactly alike.”So what do they do, first of all? The old one stays where he/she is and followshis/her old patterns as he/she wishes. The new one might land one minute, or amonth, or a year, somewhere, some place, right before the decision he/she wantsto change or avoid.Let’s take this scenario for instance; Some 30,000 years ago in his life-span;an Anunnaki male was living a nice life with his wife and family.But he felt that he did not accomplish much, and suddenly he wanted to be moreactive in the development of the universe; a change caused by witnessing ahorrendous event such as a certain group of beings in his galaxy destroying anentire civilization, and killing millions of the inhabitants, in order to takeover their planet for various purposes.It happened while an Anunnaki was on a trip, and he actually saw the destructionand actions of war while he was traveling. It was quite traumatic, and hethought, at that moment, that he must be active in preventing such events fromoccurring again, ever. So, he went back in time to be in a spot to prevent thesefateful events from happening again.There, in that new dimension, the Anunnaki leaves his former self (A copy ofhimself) as a guardian and a protector. The other copy (Perhaps one of theoriginal ones) is still on Nibiru. The branching out phenomenon occurred in oneof the designated locals of the Anunnaki Hall of Records, also called interrestrial term Akashic Records Hall.Ulema Openheimer said: “For the Anunnaki fellow there is no problem or anydifficulty in doing that. He/she will go back in time and space and change thewhole event. This means that this particular event no longer exists in achronological order.This also means that the event has been erased, because the Anunnaki cande-fragment the molecules, the substance, the vibrations and the fabric of time,but necessarily space. In other words, that event never happened in onedimension, but it is very possible, that it might still exist in another world.You could consider the cosmos as an assemblage of several layers of universes,each one on the top of the other, and sometimes parallel to each other. When theAnunnaki traverses more than two layers, we call this Anšekadu-ra abra.” Can ahuman being traverse multiple layers of time and space? Yes, however, the humanbeing will be facing a series of problems.For instance:1 -Case one: Although, he/she may cross over and enters another dimension, andsucceeds in altering, changing or even erasing a past event, the human beingmight get stuck in that dimension, and remains there for ever.In this condition, he/she is transformed into a new person without an identityor a past. A brand new person who is out-placed, without a job, without aresidence, without credentials, and without social or professional context. Itwould become very difficult for that person to make a living. How the otherswould look upon him? A person from the past? A person from the future? It is notan easy situation.2 -Case two: Because everything in the world is duplicated ad infinitum in manyuniverses, only one copy of the past event has been altered.3 -Case three: What would happen to that person, should he/she decides to returnback to his/her original world?The real problem here is not how to go back to his/her world and relive anordinary life, the life he/she had before, but what is going to happen tohim/her when that person leaves the new dimension he/she has entered?Every time a person enters another dimension, he/she creates a new copy ofhimself/herself, and occupies a new spot on the cosmos net. In our case here,that human being by entering another dimension, he/she has duplicatedhimself/herself in that new dimension, and returning to Earth, he/she will befacing another copy of himself/herself. “Is this possible? Quantum physictheorists say yes. And they add that humans can enter and live in multipleuniverses and acquire new identities, and new copies of themselves. An-zalubirach : Collecting and sorting thoughts and multiple mental images;using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phases andpractices of Tarkiz.Tarkiz means deep mental or intellectual concentration that produces telekinesisand teleportation phenomena. Anunnaki’s young students, apprentices, and noviceslearn this technique in Anunnaki schools in Ashtari. Usually, they use theirConduit (Which is located in the brain’s cells), and deep concentration on anobject hidden behind a screen or a divider made from thin paper. Synchronizingthe frequency of their Conduit and an absolute state of introspection, theAnunnaki student attempts to move the hidden object from one place to anotherwithout even touching it. In a more advanced stage, the Anunnaki studentattempts to alter the properties of the object by lowering or increasing thefrequencies and vibrations of the object. Araya: Prediction; code.According to the Ulema, the Anunnaki’s Araya is an effective tool to foreseeforthcoming events in the immediate and long term future. The expression or term“foreseeing” is never used in the Anakh language and by extraterrestrialsbecause they don’t foresee and predict. They just calculate and formulate. Inspatial terms, they don’t even measure things and distances, because time andspace do not exist as two separate “presences” in their dimensions.However, on Ashta.Ri (Ne.Be.Ru), Anunnaki are fully aware of all thesevariations, and the human concept of time and space, and have the capability ofseparating time and space, and/or combining them into one single dimension, orone single frame of existence. Anunnaki understand time differently from us,said the Ulema.For instance, on Nibiru, there are no clocks and no watches. They are useless.Then you might ask: So, how do they measure time? How do they know what time itis…now or 10 minutes later, or in one hour from now? The answer is simple: Ifyou don’t need time, you don’t need to measure it. However, on Nibiru, Anunnakiexperience time and space as we do on earth. And they do measure objects,substances, distances and locations as we do on earth. But they rarely do.“The Anunnaki (In addition to the Nordics and Lyrans) are the only knownextraterrestrials in the universe to look like humans, and in many instances,they share several similarities with the human race…” said Ulema Ghandar.This physiognomic resemblance explains to a certain degree, the reason forAnunnaki to use time.To calculate and formulate information and to acquire data, Anunnaki consult theCode Screen. Consulting the screen means pragmatically, the reading of eventssequences, explained the Ulema. Every single event in the cosmos in anydimension has a code; call it for now Nimera, a “number”, added the Ulema.Nothing happens in the universe without a reason.The universe has its own logic that the human mind cannot understand. In manyinstances, the logic of numbers dictates and creates events. And not all createdevents are understood by the extraterrestrials.This is why they resort to the Araya Code Screen. Activating the Araya Coderequires four actions or procedures: 1-Taharim:This demands clearing all the previous data stored in the “pockets” of the Net.A net resembles space net as usually used by quantum physics scientists. They doin fact compare space to a net. According to their theories, the net as thelandscape of time and space bends under the weight of a ball rotating at amaximum speed.The centrifugal effect produced by the ball alters the shape of the net, andconsequently the fabric of space. And by altering space, time changesautomatically.As time changes, speed and distances change simultaneously. Same principleapplies to stretching and cleaning up the net of the screen containing amultitude of codes of the Anunnaki. 2-Location of the Spatial Pockets:The word pockets means the exact dimension and exact space an object occupies onthe universe’s net or landscape. No more than one object or one substanceoccupies one single pocket; this is by earth standard and human level ofknowledge. In other parallel worlds, more than one object or one substance can be infusedin one single pocket. But this could lead to loss of memory. Objects andsubstances have memory too, just like human beings; some are called: > • a -Space memory,> • b -Time memory,> • c -String memory,> • d -Astral memory,> • e -Bio-organic memory,The list is endless. Thus, all pockets containing previous data are cleared. 3-Feeding the Pockets, also called Retrieving Data:All sorts and sizes of data are retrieved and stored through the Conduit. TheConduit is an electroplasmic substance implanted into the cells of the brain. 4-Viewing the data:Retrieved data and information are viewed through the Miraya, also called CosmicMirror. Some refer to it as Akashic Records. Can the Anunnaki go forward in timeand meet with the future? Yes, they can! An Ulema has said that future eventshave already happened at some level and in some spheres. It is just a matter ofa waiting period for the mind to see it. B Baliba nahr usu na Ram: Expression.Translated verbatim: “The water of the river purified my people.” Attributed toSinhar Marduchk in the Book of Rama-Dosh. Baliba means flows of waters. Nahrmeans river (Same meaning in Hebrew, Phoenician and Arabic).Usu means to clean or purify.Na means my or our.Ram means people (Same meaning in Phoenician, primitive Arabic, early Armenianand ancient Hebrew).The Ana’kh word “Usu” also means to dig.We find similar meaning in the Annals of Sardanapalus: “Nahrtu istu nahr zabaanta ahri nahr babilat kanin sumsa abbi.” Translated verbatim: “A river from theupper Zab I dug and its name I called.” Balu-ram-haba: Composed of three words:a -Balu, which means power; transition; contact.b -Ram, which means people.In this case, entities; other life-forms.c -Haba, which means beyond; other dimension.POSSIBLY, FROM BALU-RAM-HABA, DERIVED THE HEBREW WORD OLAM HA-BA.

Barak-malku: Expression. Blessing of the ruler or the king; long live the king.Composed of two words:a -Barak, which means blessing.b -Malku, which means king. Barak is Barak and Barakat in ancient Hebrew, and Barak and Barakat in Arabic.Malku is Malku, (Plural: Malki) in Assyrian. In Aramaic, it is Malak (King).In Hebrew, it is Malek (King). In Arabic, it is Malak (King). From the Ana’khMalku derived the Aramaic Malkut or Malakut (Kingdon; paradise), the ancientHebrew Malkuth (Kingdom), and the Arabic Malakoot (Paradise; kigdom of God).Not to be confused with the Semitic words Mala’k or Malak wich mean angel inHebrew and Arabic.Sargina said: “Sar sa ultu yom biluti-su malku gabra-su la ispu.” Translatedverbatim: “King who from the day of his power, a prince his rival has not been.”From the Annals of Tiglath Pileser: “Malki nikrut Assur abil.” Translatedberbatim: “Monarchs enemies of Assur (Ashur) I seized.” Bariya “Ba-riya’ah”: The creation of the world as described in theAkkadian/Sumerian texts.From Bariya, derived the primitive Arabic words Bari (Creator; God), and Baria(Creation; creatures.)The Sumerian Creation:Only one account of the Sumerian creation has survived, but it is a suggestiveone. This account functions as an introduction to the story of “TheHuluppu-Tree”. Barka-kirama: Expression.A blessing or an enlightenment (Tanwir) technique that develops teleportation.It is composed of two words:a -Barka, which means blessing.b -Kirama, which means good deeds. From Barka, derived the Hebrew words Barak and Baraka (Blessings), and theArabic Baraka and Brakaat (Blessings). From Kirama, derived the Persian Keramat(Good deeds), and the Arabic Kiramat (Honorable deeds).Barka-kirama is a very important and a primordial Anunnaki’s expression, becauseit is closely and directly related to Tay Al Ard, and Tay Al Makan, which meanteleportation. Tay Al Ard is an Ulemite/Arabic word. It is a metaphysicalexperience that produces a teleportation phenomenon; a secret esoteric practiceof the Ulema and Allamah.The Ulema claim that they have learned its secret and how its works from theRou-hi-yin who are supreme beings from the Fifth dimension.When Islam became a major religion in the Near East, and the Middle East, Tay AlArd was banned by Prophet Muhammad, who called its practitioners “Min Ahl AlNar”, meaning verbatim: Those who are from fire.Fire meant hell, or the kingdom of Al Shaytan (Satan, the devil).The Arabic pre-Islamic word Ulema was replaced by the Arabic Islamic wordAllamah or Al Hallama.However, the Ulema and the Allamah were very different from each other in manyways.The Ulema remained the custodians of the Anunnaki’s secret knowledge andesoteric powers, while the Allamah were considered as the “Alamin”, the learnedones and leading figures of letters, literature, science and religion. .Nevertheless, many Muslim teachers and spiritualists remain Ulema at heart.Many of them - secretly of course - joined the circle of the non-Muslim Ulema tolearn the ultimate knowledge acquired from non-terrestrial beings. . TheSuphists were the first to join the Non-Muslim Ulema.Worth mentioning, that around, 850 A.D., Ulema and Allamah were semanticallyoverlapping each other. And both words came to mean or express the same thing inthe eye of Arab scholars, and in the Islamic world.Many Soufiyyin (Sufis) by joining the Ulema, learned some of the secrets of TayAl-Ard. They called it: “Tay Al Makan”, meaning the folding of space. It iscomposed of two Arabic words: Tay (Folding or to fold) + Al Makan (The Space;the location; the place.) The Sufis replaced the word Al Makan with the word AlArd.The general meaning of Tay Al Ard or Tay Al Makan is to traverse the earthwithout moving. Al Munawarin claim that instead of physically moving from oneplace to another, an enlightened person can bring to himself, to where he isstanding, the place he wanted to reach. In other words, the earth of the placeto reach has been displaced under the enlightened one’s feet.Ironically, this pre-Islamic concept is now fully accepted by Muslim clerks,Cheiks and teachers of the Islamic Shari’a and Fuk’h, grouped together under theumbrella of Al Allamah.Ulema or Allamah Qadhi , previously one of the leading figures of AllamehTabatabaei explained Tay Al Ard as the termination of matter itself in theoriginal location, and its re-appearance, manifestation, and re-creation in itsfinal location, the place one wished to reach.The Iranian Dehkhoda dictionary defined Tay Al Ard as: “An aspect of Keramat“Kiramat” (Extraordinary deeds of saints and holy people) in which instead ofgoing toward a destination by taking a step forward, the earth turns itselftoward the traverser rapidly, in a blink of an eye, regardless of how far thedestination is.\"Ulema Ibn Al Nadim bin Ishaq al-Nadim (a.k.a. Al Warrak died on September 17,995. He wrote the Kitab al-Fihrist .) explained this phenomenon by citing versesfrom the Quran, taken from Chapter Al Naml;Verse: 27:38: Solomon said to his men: “O Chiefs, which of you can bring me thethrone of Queen of Sheba before she and her envoys come to me in submission?”Verse 27: 39: \"Said an 'Ifrit of Al Jinns: “I will bring it to thee before thourise from thy council. In fact, I have full power for this purpose, and may betrusted.”Verse 27:40 : “ Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to theewithin a blink of any eye!”Then when the sage Solomon saw it placed right before him, he said: “This wasdone by the authority of God all mighty, my Lord.”Some Middle Eastern sages and teachers of religious esoteric dogmas suggestedthat according to these verses, the Ulema Asif ibn Al Birkhia teleported thethrone of Queen of Sheba almostinstantaneously, in a blink of an eye. This was confirmed in a Hadith (Dialogue,a chat, or a discourse) by Jaafar Al Sadiq.Allamah have explained this teleportation phenomenon very differently.They claimed that the teleportation occurred because Ulema Asif ibn Birkhia usedone of the secret “Asma Al Allah Al Sab’a Al Husma.” (One of the seven secretnames of God.)The knowledge and use of one of the secret holy and lovely names of God allowedUlema Asif ibn Birkhia to teleport the throne. The Ulema, students of theAnunnaki, briefly explained this phenomenon. Ulema Cheik Al Kabir said(Verbatim): “Time is represented with 2 lines not perfectly aligned; one foryou, the other for what is not you. Space is represented with two circles; onefor you, the other for what is not you.If you manage to place yourself between one of the two lines and one of the twocircles without touching the other line and the other circle, you will conquertime-space.” D Dab’Laa: Term for the Anunnaki’s branching out and changing individuality inmultiple universes. This is a very complex topic, and a phenomenon difficult tocomprehend or to explain in terrestrial terms.To understand the concept, the closest metaphor in human terminology would begoing back in time by bending space and time. In this case, time and space areno longer influenced or regulated by the laws of physics as we understand themon Earth.Distances became shorter and time acts strangely, according to speed. Throughthe Dab’Laa, an Anunnaki can duplicate himself or herself, and transpose one ofthe copies of himself/herself to a new dimension.This dimension is real, because it has always physically existed in the cosmos,but at a different vibrational level. Vibrational level does not mean that allsubstances and life forms in that new dimension exist and appear as frequencies,rays and vibrations.They possess physical properties and dimensions, but are structured differently.They are made from the same molecules, and particles, but their vibrationalintensity varies.This variation allows the substances to take on different forms, i.e. water canbe solidified as ice cubes, and ice cubes can melt to become liquid water. TheAnunnaki’s branching, or splitting results in duplicate copies for 2 dimensions,or multiple copies to use in multiple universes. But these copies are notexactly alike, for the original remains the primordial center of knowledge,while the duplicates traverse the universe as a mirrored spatial memory.However, the physical structure and molecular substance of all copies areidentical.Ulema can duplicate themselves, copy themselves, but cannot clone themselves.These faculties allow them to materialize and dematerialize in parallel spheres.The Ulema are also capable of elevating the vibrations of their body and mind toa higher level. This act allows them to penetrate solid substances, such aswalls.In the new dimension, the Anunnaki uses a vivid copy of himself or herself,while the primordial composition of his/her persona remains unaltered onAshta.Ri. E Eido-Rah: Term for the non-physical substance of a human being’s body. In otherwords, the mental or astral projection of the body leaving earth. Eido-Rahmanifests to human beings, and particularly to the parents of the deceasedperson during a period of less than 40 days, following the death of a relative.From Eido-Rah, derived the Greek word Eidolon (A phantom).According to the scribes of the Book of Rama-Dosh: “After we die, the primordialsource of energy in our body leaves our body.This energy is a substance made out of Fik’r closely connected and attached to acopy of ourselves preserved in the Fourth dimension, which is not very far awayfrom us, and from Earth. As soon as this energy leaves the physical body, themind of the deceased becomes confused instantly. The mind does not realize thatthe body is dead.At this particular stage, the mind is unable to realize right away that it hasentered a new dimension.Although this new dimension is identical to the one we live in and what we callEarth, it is also very different because time, space and distance no longerexist. And also because, it exists at a different vibrational level. Everythingbecomes meta-linear.Because the mind is confused, it tries to return to Earth. The first places, themind (Or the new form-substance of the deceased one) searches for, and/or triesto return to, are always the familiar places on Earth, such as home, office,recreation center, church, mosque, synagogue, temple, etc…but the most soughtplace is usually home. So, the deceased person returns home for a very shortperiod.This does not happen all the time. Only when the deceased person is totallyconfused and disoriented. First, the deceased tries to contact relatives andclose parents.When the deceased begins to realize that parents and relatives are notresponding, the deceased tries again to send messages telepathically.Some messages if intensified can take on ectoplasmic forms, or appear as ashadow usually on smooth substances such as mirror and glass. Some deceasedpeople will keep on trying to contact their beloved ones left behind for aperiod of 39 days and 11 hours. After this time, the deceased dissipates, and nofurther attempts to establish contact with the living are made.” In anotherpassage of the Book of Rama-dosh, we read (Verbatim): “Although, it isimpossible to reach the deceased one as soon as he/she leaves the body, and/orduring the 39 days and 11 hours period following his death, sometimes, if we arelucky, and/or were extremely attached to the person we lost, a short contactwith him or with her is still possible if we pay attention to unusual thingshappening around us…those unusual things are difficult to notice, unless we paya great attention….they happen only once, sometimes twice, but this is veryrare…” The book provides techniques and methods pertaining to all forms andmeans of such contact. Ezakarerdi, “E-zakar-erdi “Azakar.Ki”:Term for the “Inhabitants of Earth” as named by the Anunnaki, and mentioned inthe Ulemite language in the “Book of Rama-Dosh.”Per contra, extraterrestrials are called Ezakarfalki “Inhabitants of Heaven orSky”. The term or phrase “Inhabitants of Earth” refers only to humans, becauseanimals and sea creatures are called Ezbahaiim-erdi. Ezakarerdi is composed ofthree words:1 -E (Pronounced Eeh or Ea) means first.2 -Zakar: This is the Akkadian/Sumerian name given to Adam by Enki. The sameword is still in use today in Arabic, and it means male. In Arabic, the femaleis called: Ountha (Oonsa). The word “Zakar” means:a -A male, and sometime a stud.b -To remember. In Hebrew, “Zakar” also means:a-T o remember (Qal in Hebrew).b-Be thought of (Niphal in Hebrew).c-Make remembrance (Hiphil in Hebrew). There is a very colorful linguistic jurisprudence in the Arabic literature thatexplains the hidden meaning of the word “Zakar”; Arabs in general believe thatman (Male) remembers things, while women generally tend to forget almosteverything, thus was born the Arabic name for a woman “Outha or Oonsa”, whichmeans literally “To forget!”Outha (Oonsa) either derives from or coincides with the words “Natha”, “Nasa”,“Al Natha”, “Nis-Yan”, which all mean the very same thing: Forgetting; toforget, or not to remember.On a theological level, Islamic scholars explain that the faculty of rememberingis a sacred duty for the Muslim, because it geared him toward remembering thatAllah (God) is the creator.Coincidently or not, Zakar in Ana’kh (Anunnaki language) and ancientBabylonian-Sumerian means also to remember. Could it be a hint or an indicationfor Adam’s duty of remembering Enki, his creator?3 -Erdi means planet Earth. Erdi was transformed by scribes into Ki in theAkkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian epics. From Erd, derived:a -The Sumerian Ersetu and Erdsetu,b -The Arabic Ard,c -The Hebrew Eretz.All sharing the same meaning: Earth; land.Thus the word Ezakarerdi means verbatim: The first man (Or Created one) of Earthor the first man on Earth, or simply, the Earth-Man.In other word, the terrestrial human. Ezakarfalki “E-zakar-falki”: Term for extraterrestrials as mentioned in the“Book of Rama-Dosh.” Per contra, inhabitants of planet Earth are calledEzakarerdi or Ezakar.Ki. In terrestrial vocabulary, extraterrestrial(s) is aterm applied to any entity(ies), object(s), substance(s), life-form(s),intelligence, and presence that have originated from beyond planet Earth. Alsoreferred to as alien(s).Contemporary ufology etymology added extraterrestrial origins coming fromouter-space, other planets, stars, galaxies, and dimensions. The word extraterrestrial is composed from three words:a- Extra, which is derived from the Latin word Extra, which means outside;additional; beyond.b -Terrestri, derived from the Latin Terrestris, which means pertaining toearth; belonging to earth; earthly; made out of earth, itself derived from theLatin words Terranum and Terrenum, which are derived from the word Terra, whichmeans earth; ground; piece of land; soil.(Note: From the Latin word Terrenum, derived the French word Terrain; and fromthe French word derived the English word terrain.)c -Al, an English addition.(Note: The Latin word Terra originally derived from the Arabic word “Tourab”(Terrab), which means dirt; dust; earth, itself derived from the Arabic wordTourba (Terrba), which means a piece of land, originally derived from the Ana’khword Turbah, pronounced Toorbaah, which means dirt from planet Earth. In the Sumerian/Akkadian epics and mythologies, the words dirt and earth referto clay; the very clay found in abundance in ancient Iraq that was used by theAnunnaki to genetically create the human race.Evolution of the extraterrestrials and the human races:The evolution of aliens, and the extraterrestrial races on many galaxies evolvedinter-dimensionally by copying, duplicating, and cloning themselves andfertilizing their own genes. On other planets, more advanced extraterrestrialcivilizations multiply and prosper through the development of brain’s waves andthoughts frequencies.They did not need to immigrate to other planets in order to survive, and/or torecreate (Reshape) themselves, as mistakenly claimed by some ufologists,extraterrestrialogists, mediums, and channelers, for they did not encounterinsurmountable ecological or bio-organic catastrophes on their own planets orstars.Zetas and Anunnaki did alter their genetics but, not for survival purposes orfor intra-planetary immigration.The alteration came as cause and effect, much needed to reach a higher level ofawareness and scientific advancement. Ezbahaiim-erdi:Term for the animals, and sea creatures living, and/or created on planet Earth.It is composed of three words:a -Ez means first creatures of a second level. (In comparison to humans.)b -Bahaiim means animals. The same word exists in Arabic, and means the verysame thing (Animals).c -Erdi means planet Earth. Ezeridim: Term for entities or super-beings from the future.In Ufology and paranormal terminologies, Ezeridim are called chrononauts, a wordderived from the Greek Khrono, which means time, and “nauts” referring to spacetravelers, or simply voyagers. Ezrai-il: Name of super-beings, who can transcend space and time, and appear tohumans as angels, in terrestrial term. The Ana’kh literature refers to them asethereal manifestation of the matter. But, our religions and Holy Scripturesdepict them as the fallen angels. Ezrai-il or Ezrail is composed of two words:a -Ezra, which means message or manifestation.b -Il, which means divine; god; creator(s). F F “ ف” : One of the esoteric letters in the Anunnaki, Ulemite and Arabicalphabets. Typical with ancient Semitic names, there are none that begin with an‘F’. The Ulema called “F” the forbidden letter, or more precisely, the letterthat was never allowed to be included in the Phoenician Aramaic, and Hebrewalphabets. “Thus all secret sounds and meanings associated with F would not bepronounced or heard, or known to the un-enlightened ones…” said Ulema Hanafi.“There are 12 secret words starting with the letter F that are hidden in theTorah, and the Book of Rama-Dosh…”, explained Ulema Sadiq Al Qaysi.And accordingly, each word produces a powerful sound capable of changing thefabric of time. The letter F was substituted by Ph, pronounced Pveh in severalSemitic languages, except Arabic; the proto-Semitic “P” became the Arabic “F”. Fadi-ya-ashadi: An Anunnaki-Ulemite term for non-terrestrial shape-shiftingentities.The Ulema have explained this phenomenon.> • For extraterrestrials, shape-shifting is necessary.> • Shape-shifting includes skin color change, organs size, general physical> appearances, but not the functionality of the body.> • The fingers become longer; thin and beneath the skin, there are millions of> microscopic hair filaments and pores (orifices) that help them hold on> slippery surfaces like glass and wet areas.> • Many of the extraterrestrial races wear tight outfits, almost glued to their> skin. Anunnaki don’t.> • The “Greys” are notorious for shape-shifting.> • They can appear like a reptile, an insect and even like humans.> • Aliens of lower dimensions need to manipulate their bodies to enter> different spheres, the atmosphere of other planets, particularly underwater> and underground environments and habitats.> • This is exactly what happens all the time with the “Greys” who live on earth> and work with scientists in restricted/confined areas, such as underground> genetic labs, and military research centers and bases.> • One of their striking characteristics is claustrophobia.> • Once confined for a long time in a limited space, the “Greys” go through> intense crises. And almost all their supernatural powers weaken considerably.> • For instance, they loose the ability to go through walls and rigid> substances, and teleport themselves.> • Even though, some of them, like their head scientists for instance retain> the ability to resize their bodies, lower the density of their bodies’> molecules and penetrate dense layers, the confined condition diminishes many> of their faculties, and considerably limits the possibilities of body’s> manipulations. Anunnaki vis-à-vis other alien races:Anunnaki look very different from the Zetas and the numerous alien races thathave visited the Earth. In this context, they never appear or manifest likereptilians or short “Greys”.Sinhar Ambar Anati said:> • “It is easy to recognize an Anunnaki, because he usually appears like a tall> warrior.> • An Anunnaki’s vest is made from thin layers of metal called “Handar”.> • His wears a long robe “Arbiya” of dark colors.> • Underneath the Arbiya, he wears a sort of pans with wide contour.> • On his wrist, you always notice his navigation tool.” Anunnaki’s characteristics:> • The Anunnaki can transmute and manipulate their bodies if needed. This> happens very rarely.> • In many instances, they don’t need to do so, because they are already known> to so many galactic and outer-galactic civilizations, and are seen by> inhabitants of millions and millions of stars, planets and moons.> • They are superstars in their own rights.> • The Anunnaki can easily shape-shift themselves. This is necessary for> climatic and atmospheric reasons.> • Each planet, star and dimension has its own climate, temperature and> atmosphere.> • Consequently the organic-galactic body must adapt to these environment’s> conditions in order to remain functional.> • When they visit earth or a similar sphere, the Anunnaki slightly change> their physical appearances, not so much, because in general, they look like> us, except their eyes are much bigger, and they are much taller than us.> • Anunnaki are 9 foot tall.> • Even their women are extremely tall by human standard. Some women are 8 foot> tall.> • When they travel to other planets, minor changes are required. For instance,> when they get out of their galaxy and visit the planets Niftar, Marshan-Haloum> and Ibra-Anu, they change the color of their skin, and the shape of their> hands.> • On Niftar, inhabitants have grey-blue color skin and 3 fingers in each hand. Falak-Dounia: Name of one of the dimensions of the world of the Anunnaki called“Anunnakifalak Dounia ”, which means the multiple universe of the Anunnaki.According to the Ulema Kira’at, as far as humans are concerned, there are twoAnunnaki’s worlds:1 -Sama,2 -Falak or Dounia. Falak “Dounia” is not a physical world.No living human beings as physical creatures live in this second world.“Physical objects including human beings cannot enter a non-physical world,unless their molecules are reduced to a lower level of vibrations…” said UlemaAl Bakri.Thus, Falak “Dounia” is not a world where human beings could live with theirphysical bodies. Falak “Dounia” is the world of the human mind.The human mind was created by the Anunnaki. The human mind can manifest itselfas the Double of a physical body…” explained Ulema Raja Shinkar.Falak consists of seven different “Woujoud”, meaning existences. Three of theseWoujoud already exist in a physical-nonphysical sphere of illusion, called“Kha-Da’h”. Planet earth is one of these three existences. But these threeexistences do not count as meaningful dimensions. This is why we start countingwith the Fourth dimension as the first sphere of Falak.a -The first Woujoud is known to us as the Fourth dimension, and it is called“Nafis-Ra”.b -The second Woujoud is known to us as the Fifth dimension, and it is called“Fik’r-Ra”.c -The third Woujoud is known to us as the Sixth dimension, and it is called“Kadosh-Ra” or “Koudous-Ra”.d -The fourth Woujoud is known to us as the Seventh dimension, and it is called“Khalek-Ra”.In other words, the Falak is the world of human beings who continue to livethrough their mind. Extraterrestrials of a very high vibrational state couldshare this sphere with the purified mind of humans (The deceased ones). Falakstarts as soon as we die. It is neither outside nor inside our solar system, andno light years separate humans from any dimension or state of existencein Falak. Some Bashar (Human beings) have already reached different vibrationallevels and spheres in Falak “Dounia”. Fana.Ri “Fanna-Ri”: Name for a beam, or a sort of light used in thefertilization and genetic reproduction process of the Anunnaki.According to Ulema Albaydani, “ Anunnaki reproduction is done by technology,involving the light passing through the woman’s body until it reaches herovaries and fertilizes her eggs. The eggs go into a tube. The woman is lying ona white table for this procedure, surrounded by female medical personnel.No discomfort is caused by this operation, because it resembles a scanningprocess.” If performed by uncaring aliens (such as the Greys and Reptilians) itis unpleasant and even can be painful, which has given rise to abductee’sstories of suffering. However, not all aliens are created equal, and havesimilar agenda. The Anunnaki, which are a very compassionate race, are verygentle and the procedure is harmless. Apparently, the Anunnaki version of sex ismuch more enjoyable for both genders. It involves an emanation of light fromboth participants. The light mingles and the result is a joy that is at the sametime physical and spiritual. The Anunnaki do not have genitals the way we do.As an Anunnaki hybrid becomes more and more Anunnaki, he/she loses the sexualorgans.The hybrid welcomes the changes and feels that he/she has gained a lot throughthe transformation. The Anunnaki mate for life, like ducks.They don’t even understand the concept of infidelity, and don’t have a word forcheating, mistress, extramarital affairs, etc. in their language. Like manyextraterrestrials, the Anunnaki do not have genital organs, but a lower level ofaliens who inhabit the lowest interdimensional zone and aliens-hybrids living onearth do.The stories of the abductees who claim to have had sex with Anunnaki are to bedisregarded. Those stories are pure fiction.Summary of fertilization and reproduction:1 -Aliens reproduce in laboratories.2 -Aliens do not practice sex at all.3 -Aliens fertilize “each other” and keep the molecules (not eggs or sperms, ormixed liquids from males and females) in containers at a very specifictemperature and following well-defined fertilization-reproduction specs.4 -Alien babies are retrieved from the containers after 6 months. 5 -Thefollowing month, the mother begins to assume her duty as a mother.6 -Alien mothers do not breast-feed their babies, because they do not havebreast, nor do they produce milk to feed their babies.7- Alien babies are nourished by a “light conduit.”8 -Human sperm or eggs are useless to extraterrestrials of the higher dimension.9 -Extraterrestrials are extremely advanced in technology and medicine.Consequently, they do not need any part, organ, liquid or cell from the humanbody to create their own babies.10- -However, there are several aliens who live in lower dimensions and zoneswho did operate on abductees for other reasons – multiple reasons and purposes –some are genetic, others pure experimental. Fari-narif “Fari-Hanif”: Or simply Ra-Nif.A term for categorizing different forms of spirits, or non-physical entities.The Anunnaki referred to many different forms, shapes and “rating” of entitiesknown to the human race as “Spirits” and “Souls”. From “Ra” and “Ra-Nif”,derived the Semitic words Rouh, Rafesh, Nefes, Nefs, Roach, and Ruach , meaningthe soul in Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew.I. Souls and spirits in Anunnaki-Ulema literature:“The soul or spirit is a concept created by man,” said Ulema Bakri. “Man wascreated, lives and continues to live through his Mind…not through his soul.Angels do exist, but humans don’t understand a thing about them, becausereligions taught Man that angels are spirits. The truth is they are neitherspirits, nor the messengers of God, but a projection of a higher level ofgoodness and intelligence…and those who (after their physical death on earth)enter a higher dimension, would meet the angels in the Fourth dimension asmeta-plasmic presence emanating beauty and goodness, but they are not divinespirits or pure souls.” added Ulema Bakri. Fasirach “Fisara”: Nutrition. It is related to the nutrition and food ofnon-terrestrial entities. Extraterrestrials do not absorb food. They don’t eatlike we do, simply because they do not have stomach, intestines and digestiveorgans.Don’t confuse them with hybrids, semi-humans and Anunnaki. Hybrids living onearth, whether among humans or in restricted areas, such as their own habitatand underground installations eat and drink, and many of them enjoy humans’food.No, they are not vegetarians, they eat meat and flesh, and this is why they areconsidered by extraterrestrials as “inferior breed”. Extraterrestrials do noteat meat or flesh.It was reported by William Cooper that Zetas:a -Absorb certain substances from parts of the cattle that stabilize them duringthe cloning process;b -This can be placed under the tongue to give sustenance and stability for sometime .[http://www.totse.com/en/fringe/mj_12_the_alien_government_conspiracy/arious.html]It is a substance that comes from certain mucus membranes: The lips, nose,genitals and rectum, and also from certain organs;c -These glandular substances serve as nutrients in lieu of eating. Resting thesubstances under the tongue is not the only way they get nutrition. The cattlemutilations generally result in all the blood being drained from the body.The Zetas have in their bases canisters and vats in which animal and humanorgans float along with a purple liquid to hold these parts in suspension.(Author’s note: Mr. Cooper’s claims are not totally substantiated. And I doubtthe veracity of some of his statements.)Mr. Cooper also claimed that the Zetas use hydrogen peroxide in both theabsorption and elimination process, because allegedly, the hydrogen peroxidealso helps to preserve the liquid and organ mixture to keep it from spoiling.The “Greys” have no digestive tract and eliminate through the skin. Toeliminate, they need to pass the substance through some part of their body, muchthe same way plants eliminate through their skin or outer shells. They usehydrogen peroxide for helping with that elimination as wellN ote: Mr. Cooper’s description of food elimination after absorption is correct.They dispose of the rest of the absorbed food through their skin withoutproducing odors. In a sense, the food substance evaporates through thedermatologic pores. Fik’r: The ability of reading others’ thoughts.Derived from the Anakh Fik-R’r, and Fik.Ra.Sa.The esoteric Arabic word “Firasa” is derived from Fik.Ra.Sa. It means in Arabicthe ability to read thoughts, to understand the psyche of a person just bylooking at him/her.The Ulema uses Fik’r to read the mind, to learn about the intentions of others,and assess the level of intelligence of people.As defined in the “Anunnaki Encyclopedia” (Authored by M. de Lafayette), andaccording to the doctrine and Kira’at of the Ulema, the soul is an invention ofearly humans who needed to believe in a next life. It was through the soul thatmortals could and would hope to continue to live after death.Soul as an element or a substance does not exist anywhere inside the human body.Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes the brainfunction, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul.The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the time theycreated the final form of the human race.Fik’r was not used in the early seven prototypes of the creation of mankindaccording to the Sumerian texts.Although The “Fik’r”, is the primordial source of life for our physical body, itis not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is thephysical description of our genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers andsequences of what there in our body, the data and history of our genes, geneticorigin, ethnicity, race, so on. Thus Fik’r includes DNA.The Ulema said: “Consider Fik’r as acosmic-sub-atomic-intellectual-extraterrestrial (Meaning non-physical,non-earthly) depot of all what it constituted, constitutes and shall continue toconstitute everything about you.And it is infinitesimally small. However, it can expand to an imaginabledimension, size and proportions. It stays alive and continues to grow after wepass away if it is still linked to the origin of its creation, in our case theAnunnaki.The Fik’r is linked to the Anunnaki our creators through a “Conduit” found inthe cells of the brain. For now, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble.After death, this bubble leaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as thebubble leaves the body.The body dies because the bubble leaves the body.Immediately, with one tenth of one million of a second, the molecule or thebubble frees itself from any and everything physical, including the atmosphere,the air, and the light; absolutely everything we can measure, and everythingrelated to earth, including its orbit. The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to stand judgment andawait the decision of God -whether you have to go to heaven or hell– becausethere is no hell and there is no heaven the way we understand hell and heaven.So it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhistor a believer in any other religion. The molecule (Bubble) enters the originalblueprint of “YOU”; meaning the first copy, the first sketch, the first formulathat created you. Humans came from a blueprint.Every human being has a Double. Your double is a copy stored in the“Rouh-Plasma”; an enormous compartment under the control of the Anunnaki onNibiru and can be transported to another star, if Nibiru ceases to exist.And this double is immortal. In this context, human is immortal, because itsDouble never dies. Once the molecule re-enters your original copy (Which is theoriginal You), you come back to life with all your faculties, including yourmemory, but without physical, emotional and sensorial properties (The propertiesyou had on earth), because they are not perfect.”Ulema Sadiq said: “At that time, and only at that time, you will decide whetheryou want to stay in your Double or go somewhere else…the universe is yours. Ifyour past life on earth accumulated enough good deeds such as charity,generosity, compassion, forgiveness, goodness, mercy, love for animals, respectfor nature, gratitude, fairness, honesty, loyalty…then your Double will have allthe wonderful opportunities and reasons to decide and select what shape, format,condition you will be in, and where you will continue to live.”In other words, you will have everything, absolutely everything and you can haveany shape you want including a brand new corporal form. You will be able tovisit the whole universe and live for ever, as a mind, as an indestructiblepresence, and also as a non-physical, non- earthly body, but you can stillre-manifest yourself in any physical body you wish to choose. Worth mentioning here, that the molecule, (So-called soul in terrestrial term)enters a mew dimension by shooting itself into space and passing through the“Baab”, a sort of a celestial star-gate or entrance. If misguided, your molecule(So-called your soul) will be lost for ever in the infinity of time and spaceand what there is between., until reconnected to your prototype via the“Miraya”.Is the afterlife a physical world? According to the Anunnaki Ulema: “No and yes.Because life after death unites time and space and everything that itconstitutes space and time. It means extending to, and encompassing everythingin the universe, and everything you saw, knew, felt, liked and disliked.Everything you have experienced on earth exists in other dimensions, and thereare lots of them. Everything you saw on Earth has its duplicate in anotherdimension. Even your past, present and future on Earth have another past,another present and another future in other worlds and other dimensions. And ifyou are lucky and alert, you can create more pasts, more presents and morefutures, and continue to live in new wonderful worlds and dimensions; thishappens after you die. Anunnaki and some of their messengers and remnants onEarth can do that. The physical aspect of the afterlife can be recreated the wayyou want it by using your Fik’r. Yes, you can return to Earth as a visitor, andsee all the shows and musicals on Broadway or hang out on Les Champs - Elysées.You can also talk to many people who died if you can find their Double in theafterlife.You can also enjoy the presence of your pets (Dead or alive), and continue toread a book you didn’t finish while still alive on earth. What you currently seeon Earth is a replica of what there is beyond Earth and beyond death. The afterlife is also non physical, because it has different properties, densityand ways of life.” Anunnaki Ulema Wang Lin said: “Through Fik’r, a person canenter higher dimensions. It is of a major importance to train your Fik’r.“Transmission of the mind” training sessions can develop extra-sensorialfaculties and open your “inner eye” commonly referred to as the Third Eye…”Metaphysical-religious context:“Although the Anunnaki do not believe in the same God we worship, revere andfear, understanding their concept of Khalek,the creator of our universe (Our galaxy), and other galaxies, the whole universeand especially life after death (The afterlife) could change the way weunderstand “God”, the universe, the reason for our existence on earth, theprinciple of immortality, because it opens up a new way to comprehend the placeof Man in the universe in this life and all the ones beyond the frontiers oftime and space…”, said Ulema Ghandar.“The Anunnaki-Ulema’s view of the afterlife gives a great hope and an immenserelief to human beings…to all of us…”, added Ulema Stambouli. According to the “Book of Rama-Dosh”, the only Anunnaki’s manuscript left onearth in the custody of the Ul’ma (Ulema), humans should not be afraid to die,nor fear what is going to happen to them after they die.Sinhar Marduck, an Anunnaki leader and scholar said human life continues afterdeath in the form of “Intelligence” stronger than any form of energy known tomankind. And because it is mental, the deceased human will never suffer again;there are no more pain, financial worries, punishment, hunger, violence or anyof the anxiety, stress, poverty and serious daily concerns that have createdconfusion and unhappiness for the human beings.After death, the human body never leaves earth, nor comes back to life by an actof God, Jesus, or any Biblical prophet. This body is from dirt, and to dirt itshall return. That’s the end of the story.Inside our body, there is not what we call “Soul”.Soul is an invention of mankind. It does not exist anywhere inside us. Instead,there is a non-physical substance called Fik’r that makes the brain function,and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul.The Fik’r was created by the Anunnaki at the time they designed us. The Fik’r isthe primordial source of energy for our body. “However, the Fik’r despite itsclose tie to the human body, it does not belong to our physical properties…ourmind has its own sphere, and quite often, it works independently from the body,this is how imagination and mental creativity are produced…” said Ulema Ghandar.The Fik’r contains the DNA and all its genetic data. Fikrama “Fikr-Rama”: The “Fik’r” (Brain cell-Conduit) sixth wave, unknown yet toscience. It is related to An-zalubirach, also known as Tarkiz; a mental trainingthat develops a supernatural power.To fully understand what Fikrama “Fikr-Rama” means, we must first comprehendwhat An-zalubirach is, and how it works.An-zalubirach is an Ana’kh/Ulemite term meaning the following:a -Collecting thoughts, receiving and sending multiple mental images via brainwave synchronization, to improve mental and physical health ;b- Using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phases and practices of Tarkiz.Tarkiz means deep mental or intellectual concentration that produces telekinesisand teleportation phenomena.Ulema’s students learn this technique in various forms.Basically it works like this:a -The students use their Conduit (Which is located in the brain’s cells) tocontrol the waves of their brains (First level of learning) b -The studentsconcentrate on an object hidden behind a screen or a divider made from thin ricepaper. (Second level of learning) By synchronizing the frequency of theirConduit and an absolute state of introspection, the students attempt to move thehidden object from one place to another without even touching it. In a more advanced stage, the students attempt to alter the properties of theobject by lowering or increasing the frequencies and vibrations of the objectitself.The Ulema brain’s waves: In addition to Beta, Alpha, Theta, and Delta, theAnunnaki Ulema developed a sixth wave called Fikr-Rama. It is neither measurablenor detectable, because it does not emanate from the physical brain. It istriggered by the Conduit situated in the brain’s cells. No science on earth candirect us to the exact position of the Conduit. The Ulema said:1 -Through the mechanism of the Conduit, the enlightened ones regulate mind’swaves and frequencies.2 -The Fikr-Rama allows them to enter other dimensions, solid substances andmatter.3 -The Fikr-Rama is a sort of a beam much lighter than laser. It does not haveparticles.4 -It has no substance per se, yet, it contains energy.5 -Extraterrestrials in general, and Anunnaki in particular have a multitude ofsimilar brain’s waves.6 -The Fikr-Rama is one single tone in the rainbow of their mental vibrations.7 -Highly advanced extraterrestrial beings can project thoughts and holographicimages using any of their mental vibrations waves. Filfila “Fil-I-fila”: Name for an esoteric symbol closely related to theAnunnaki’s “Light Liquid” and the “Flower of Life”.Literally it means a rose. And the rose represents a magical chalice. Some time,the chalice itself. Quite often, this chalice was depicted as a mushroom. It isquite obvious, that the chalice, the rose, the Flower of Life are symbols. Inthe black arts, esoterism, so-called magic, and other secret esoteric and occultteachings and principles, behind each symbol, there is another secret symbol,and behind each depiction or illustration, there is another secret illustrationand depiction. Filfila is no exception. Perhaps the following excerpt from the Anunnaki-UlemaKira’at, could elucidate the matter: “…The meaning of the name of the greatPerseus, founder of the Perseid Dynasty , and builder of the citadel of Mycenaeis: “The Place of the Mushroom”, and various illustrations of the mushroomappear abundantly on churches’ columns.Another striking example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedek that appearedon a façade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding a chalice in theshape of a mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the Holy Grail, asinterpreted in the literature of Cathars, Templar Knights, and many enlightenedeastern secret societies. It was also interpreted as the “Divine-Human Vessel”,meaning the womb of Virgin Mary; the very womb that gave birth to Jesus. Inancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to the Anunnaki, themushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of the female.More precisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of life andall living creatures. This fecundity source came in the form of a mitochondrialDNA. Also, the secret extracted liquid of the mushroom represented the “LightLiquid” known also as Elixir of Life.On many Templars’ pillars and Bourj (Upper part of a medieval fortress or acastle) in Syria, Malta and Lebanon, the mushroom is carefully illustrated as a“Flower of Life” known to the Phoenicians, Habiru (Hebrew), early Arabs,Sumerians and Anunnaki as:a -Wardah;b -Ward;c -Vardeh. These three words (Meaning a rose, or a flower) in ancient linguistic context,symbolized the blooming of life. At one point in history, the mushroom’s figurewas used by the Templar Order of St. John of Malta as the symbol of the HolyGrail. And in other passages, the mushroom represented a head; the head of aSinhar “A leader”. Some historians thought that the leader was Baphomet, while others believed itwas Noah, and another group believed it was the Prophet Mohammed, and finally,there is a group of learned masters who claimed that is was the Khalek ofMarkabah. Khalek is one of the seventy two names/attributes of God in Arabic(Now, 99), and Markabah or Merkabah means a spaceship in Sumerian and Akkadian. The Anunnaki’s mushroom symbol gave birth to the “Cult of Head”. Anne Ross inher book “ Pagan Celtic Britain”, wrote: “The Cult of the Human Head constitutesa persistent theme throughout all aspects of Celtic life spiritual and temporaland the symbol of the severed head may be regarded as the most typical anduniversal of their religious attitudes.” Firasa or “Firasa-Basira”: Arabic. Usually associated with Basira. Literally, itmeans perception, intelligence, discretion, evidence, and insight. All theseattributes define Firasa-Basira.In addition, it is understood and depicted as having an eye of the heart open,deep perception, an ability to see consequences just at the beginning of an act,or foresight.Insight acquires a different, deeper dimension among Sufis. It is considered thesole source of spiritual knowledge obtained through reflective thought andinspiration, the first degree in the spirit’s perception of the reality ofthings, and a major power of conscience that discerns and establishes valuesoriginating in the spirit, whereas reason becomes entangled in colors, forms,and qualities.It is also a power of perception so sharpened by the light of nearness to theDivine Being that, when other powers of perception become exhausted byimagining, it acquires great familiarity with mysteries lying behind things and,without any guide or evidence, reaches the Truth of the Truths, where reason isbewildered. According to ascetic Sufism and the early spiritual-esoteric Islam, seeing isone of the luminous attributes of God, and one’s insight, as declared in “ Wehave shared among them.” (43:32)The greatest portion belongs to the one who, having benefited from that DivineSource to the fullest poured his inspirations into the hearts of his followers,namely the Prophet. The Divine Declaration s aid: “This is my path. I call toGod on clear evidence and by insight, I and whoever follows me.” (12:108). This matchless perceptiveness allows the traveler on the path of Ascension toreach a higher sphere beyond corporeal existence.The pleasure of observance given by insight sometimes acquires a new, deeperdimension when the believer begins to discern and discover the spiritualdimension and meanings of things and events.His or her spirit experiences other dimensions in this three-dimensional realm,and his or her conscience becomes the eye of existence with which it sees, andreaches a higher intellect.In addition to perception and understanding, discernment (Firasa) denotes thedeepening of insight when perception becomes a source of certain knowledge.Those who discern the manifestations of the light of God, acquire a radiantfaculty that allows them to see everything, and understand all issues, withtotal clarity. They are never confused, even when encountering the mostintricate elements. (15:75). (Source: F ethullah G ülen.) Firasa and the paranormal: Almost all rulers in ancient Persia, Phoenicia andlater in Egypt employed in their royal courts, “People of Firasa”. Theyconsulted with them during visits of dignitaries and officials from foreigncountries. It was the secret science of learning about the personality of peoplethrough the study of physiognomy.This science was called “Firasa”. One of the greatest Ulema masters and expertsin the field was Fakher Addīn Al- Rāzī. His noted treatise on Firasa “TheScience of Psycho-physiognomy” was inspired by the teachings of the eldernon-physical Ulema. In the unpublished original edition of his treatise, severalAnunnaki syllables and geometric forms were included in “Al Moukamma” theintroduction of the book dedicated to the “True believers of the higherknowledge”. G Gabhatimani: The reader of galactic maps; the decipher of codes and symbols.From Gabhatimani, derived the Sanskrit word Gabhastiman, which means repossessed of his rays. Gadaridu: Ana’kh/Ulemite. A term for an Anunnaki’s method used to alter agenetic code. According to the Anunnaki Ulema, some mental techniques usingAna’kh words can alter the composition of the human DNA.The change brought to the DNA can be read on a chart, animated on a screen-gridcalled Miraya.Ulema Sadiq said: “Although our DNA is our permanent biological, chemical,physical, mental and structural identity, thisDNA can be altered, because it is a genetic formula, more precisely a program asdefined in our terminology.As such, any program can be reprogrammed and deprogrammed. There is a multitudeof means and techniques to do that. One of them is the use of vocal imagery.The Vocal imagery is the continuous sequence of sounds and words produced byvocal chords, as well as brain’s waves. They have the capability of changing thecomposition and sequences in our DNA. This procedure was used by the Anunnaki,after they have created the first seven human prototypes.The Anunnaki’s genetic change brought to the physiognomy and mental faculties ofthe quasi-humans some 65,000 years, added “intelligent mobility” to the body,and allowed the early human beings to acquire a sense of understanding of theirimmediate environment.This was done in genetic laboratories, here on planet Earth, using sounds andwords….motion, sounds, voices, words and even thoughts, all have DNA…some have agenetic reproduction power…” Gens “Jenesh”: A gender.Similar words appeared in Semitic languages. To name afew:a -Gens in Arabic;b -Gensa in Assyrian;c -Gensu in Akkadian. Ghen-ardi-vardeh, also “Gen-adi-warkah”: Aagerdi-deh for short.The act orprocess of talking to others without using words, and in a total silence.Composed from three words:a -Gen, which means people; others.b -Ardi, which means earthly; land; location. Ertz in Hebrew, and Ard in Arabic.Ersetu “Erdsetu” in Assyrian and Sumerian. All derived from the Ana’kh Erd andArd.c- Vardeh, which means rose; flower; aroma; chalice; quest. Vardeh in Hebrew and Arabic, and it means a rose in both languages. Warkah is asubstitute for Vardeh, and it means a paper; a page. Ulema Seif Eddine Chawkattold a great story about Gen-ardi-vardeh, and briefly explained how it works inthe Book of Rama-Dosh. He said (Verbatim, unedited): “During World War One, myfather worked as a military superintendent for the Turkish army. In prisoners ofwar camps, some medical visits and check-ups were scheduled once a month.It did not happen in all the concentration camps and centers of detention, butit did happen at one particular place, and my father worked there. Some Britishofficers (Prisoners of war) were treated properly, while others were not solucky. Malaria, dysentery, and other health problems among prisoners werefrequent. The Turkish army ran out of medicine and quinine pills, and theprisoners’ health condition began to deteriorate. In brief, not all prisonersreceived medical treatment. One of those unfortunate British officers was MajorV. H.He was in serious trouble. And because he fell so ill, he could not talkanymore, and succumbed to a threatening fever. Yet, no medical attention wasgiven to him, until, and probably by pure coincidence or luck, a military doctorentered the tent and saw him there agonizing in his bed. The doctor noticed hisserious condition and approached him. Unfortunately, nothing could be done; medicine and pills were no longeravailable, and the only thing one could have done in similar situations was towipe out the sweat of the sick prisoners. But something very unusual happenedthere. The doctor briefly examined the major who was agonizing, but could notutter not one word. He placed his hand on his forehead and throat, and all of asudden, as my father recalls, “the whole situation changed immediately.The doctor ordered one of his adjutants to fetch a certain box; we did not knowwhat it was. When the adjutant returned carrying the box, we saw what was init…bandages, medicine, pills, everything you needed…syringes…etc. the major waslucky; the doctor took care of him, he gave him a few pills, told the adjutantto watch over him, and asked him to bring the major new clean pillows andblankets. We were stunned.All of a sudden, the doctor and the major became friends. Two years later, when the war ended, and by a pure coincidence, my father metthe military doctor in Budapest, and they start to talk about the war and somany other things. One of those things was Major V. H. story. My father askedthe doctor why he cared so much for the major, and not the others. And thedoctor replied that the major was one of the “Brothers”. In other words, anovice-Ulema just like himself. How did he find out? Smiling, the doctor told myfather: “I touched his forehead and his throat…and by touching his throat Icould read his silent message to me. He told me that he was Ulema.” In otherwords, the British major used the technique of Aagerdi-deh to talk to the doctorwithout opening his mouth, and of course to let him know that he was an Ulema.The British major hoped that the Turkish doctor might be an Ulema himself, andif so, he would be able to get his “silent message.”And he was! Both were Ulema, and this is why the Turkish physician cared so muchfor the British prisoner. “Of course nobody believed this”, said my father. Infact, every time my father told this story, people laughed at him.” Amazingly,ninety years later, NASA began to explore Aagerdi-deh. They call it now the“Subvocal Speech.”Most recently, NASA issued a press release to that effect; it isself-explanatory. Herewith an excerpt from the release, and update on NASA’smost fascinating project. “ NASA develops system to computerize silent,“Subvocal Speech”: NASA scientists have begun to computerize human, silentreading using nerve signals in the throat that control speech.In preliminary experiments, NASA scientists found that small, button-sizedsensors, stuck under the chin and on either side of the \"Adam's apple,\" couldgather nerve signals, and send them to a processor and then to a computerprogram that translates them into words.Eventually, such “subvocal speech” systems could be used in spacesuits, in noisyplaces like airport towers to capture air-traffic controller commands, or evenin traditional voice-recognition programs to increase accuracy, according toNASA scientists. “What is analyzed is silent, or subauditory, speech, such aswhen a person silently reads or talks to himself,” said Jorgensen, a scientistwhose team is developing silent, subvocal speech recognition at NASA's AmesResearch Center, Moffett Field, Calif.“Biological signals arise when reading or speaking to oneself with or withoutactual lip or facial movement,\" Jorgensen explained. “A person using thesubvocal system thinks of phrases and talks to himself so quietly, it cannot beheard, but the tongue and vocal chords do receive speech signals from thebrain,\" Jorgensen said.In their first experiment, scientists \"trained\" specialsoftware to recognize six words and 10 digits that the researchers repeatedsubvocally. Initial word recognition results were an average of 92 percentaccurate.The first sub-vocal words the system \"learned\" were \"stop,\" \"go,\" \"left,\"\"right,\" \"alpha\" and \"omega,\" and the digits \"zero\" through \"nine.\"Silently speaking these words, scientists conducted simple searches on theInternet by using a number chart representing the alphabet to control a Webbrowser program.“We took the alphabet and put it into a matrix -- like a calendar. We numberedthe columns and rows, and we could identify each letter with a pair ofsingle-digit numbers,” Jorgensen said. “So we silently spelled out 'NASA' andthen submitted it to a well-known Web search engine. We electronically numberedthe Web pages that came up as search results.We used the numbers again to choose Web pages to examine. This proved we couldbrowse the Web without touching a keyboard,” Jorgensen explained. Scientists aretesting new, \"noncontact\" sensors that can read muscle signals even through alayer of clothing.A second demonstration will be to control a mechanical device using a simple setof commands, according to Jorgensen. His team is planning tests with a simulatedMars rover. \"We can have the model rover go left or right using silently'spoken' words,\" Jorgensen said.People in noisy conditions could use the system when privacy is needed, such asduring telephone conversations on buses or trains, according to scientists. “Anexpanded muscle-control system could help injured astronauts control machines.If an astronaut is suffering from muscle weakness due to a long stint inmicrogravity, the astronaut could send signals to software that would assistwith landings on Mars or the Earth, for example,” Jorgensen explained.“A logical spin-off would be that handicapped persons could use this system fora lot of things.” To learn more about what is in the patterns of the nervesignals that control vocal chords, muscles and tongue position, Ames scientistsare studying the complex nerve-signal patterns.“We use an amplifier to strengthen the electrical nerve signals. These areprocessed to remove noise, and then we process them to see useful parts of thesignals to show one word from another,” Jorgensen said. After the signals areamplified, computer software \"reads\" the signals to recognize each word andsound.“The keys to this system are the sensors, the signal processing and the patternrecognition, and that's where the scientific meat of what we're doing resides,”Jorgensen explained. “We will continue to expand the vocabulary with sets ofEnglish sounds, usable by a full speech-recognition computer program.”TheComputing, Information and Communications Technology Program, part of NASA'sOffice of Exploration Systems, funds the subvocal word-recognition research.There is a patent pending for the new technology, as noted by NASA Gensi-uzuru: Apparition of deceased pets. The Ulema are very fond of animals.Extensive passages in the Book of Rama-Dosh speak about the important roleanimals play in the life of humans, especially at emotional and therapeuticlevels. The Ulema believe that pets understand very well their human-friends(Instead of using the word “owners”). And also, pets communicate with those whoshow them love and affection.This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not end whenpets die. Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility ofcontacting deceased people or animals, they have explained to us that contactingour departed ones is possible for a very short time, and only during the 40 daysperiod following their death. In other words, we can contact our deceased parents and dear ones, or moreaccurately enter in contact with them if:a -They contact us short after their death;b -They must initiate the contact;c -This should happen during a 40 days period following their departure;d -Their contact (Physical or non-physical) must be noticed by us. This meansthat we should and must pay an extra attention to “something” quite irregular orunusual happening around us.Because our departed pets will try to send us messages, and in many instances,they do.e -We must expect their messages, and strongly believe in those messages. The Ulema said that humans cannot contact their dead pets.But pets can contact us via different ways we can sense and feel, if we havedeveloped a strong bond with them. Pets know who love them and those who don’t,because pets feel, understand, sense and see our aura.All our feelings and thoughts are imprinted in our aura, and the aura is easilyvisible to pets, particularly, cats, dogs, parrots, lionesses, pigs, and horses.This belief is shared by authors, people of science and therapists in the West,despite major difference between Westerners and Ulema in defining the nature andlimits of pets-humans after death contact. Ulema in defining the nature andlimits of pets-humans after death contact. For instance, in the United States,pets lovers and several groups of therapists and psychics think that “a pet canreappear as a ghost.And a ghost could be luminous or even appear as it did in life. You don'tnecessarily know when you see an animal if it's a ghost or not, said Warren, aresearcher in the field. “It's much easier to identify a loved one who's passedand come back.”“Don't forget them because they're gone,” said Jungles, who owns three cats.“Keep their toys and blankets around.They (ghosts) will go where they're happiest.” Warren agrees. “Recreate anenvironment conducive to the pet's life,” he said. “Use your imagination andtreat it like it's alive. In other words, you should create or re-createconditions ideal for their re-appearance, even though, for a very short moment. Gholaim: Ana’kh / Ulemite name for ghosts.The occasional apparitions of deceased persons, but in no instances whatsoeverof the spirits of the dead, or invisible astral entities producing variouspsychic phenomena. This age-old belief is consistent with the breaking up ofcomposite human nature into its component parts at death. As the astralmodel-body, when freed from its familiar physical duplicate, is stillmagnetically attached to the body, it is sometimes seen haunting the new gravefor a short time. Soon the atoms of this shadowy form begin to dissipate. Butthe more ethereal and enduring astral atoms cohere in the kama-rupic body of thedeceased person's lower mental, emotional, and psychic nature. Giabiru: Death; a dead person lost in a parallel dimension. From Giabiru,derived the Assyrian noun Giabi, which means a reaper.

Definition and introduction.II. The “Grays”: The intraterrestrial non-human race._________________ I. Definition and introduction:An Ulemite term referring to human genetic contamination, caused by the “Grays”.The contamination was the result of an inter-breeding program secretly carriedout by an intraterrestrial non-human race living on Earth, usually referred toas the “Grays”. The inter-breeding with humans is a major part of their agenda.And this is a serious threat that humanity is constantly facing. II. The “Grays”: Intraterrestrial non-human race:It is important to understand that the Grays have lived on Earth for millions ofyears, long before the human races were created by the Igigi, Anunnaki andLyrans. We call the Grays “extraterrestrials”.This is not correct, for the Greys are intraterrestrials, living deepunderground and underwater, and humans are the co-inhabitants of planet Earth.We fear the Grays. And ironically, the Grays fear us. They feel threatened byour nuclear arsenal, nuclear tests and experiments, because they can annihilateEarth, where the Grays live.Earth is the habitat of the Grays. Earth is where their communities and familieslive. Grays will do anything and everything to prevent humans from destroyingEarth. Earth will be only destroyed by acts of nuclear war. Grays have adaptedvery well to the intra-landscape of Earth; meaning the Inner-Earth. And water onEarth is essential for their survival and for “energizing” their crafts.Unfortunately, constant genetic interaction with the Grays will deteriorate thegenes of the human race. The first phase of such deterioration is contamination.The Anunnaki are fully aware of this contamination. Simply put, in order toeliminate the contamination, the Anunnaki must get rid of the Grays. And thedecontamination process will result in a major confrontation with the Grays.Some influential governments have already received a sort of “briefing” on thesubject. Some high officials took the threat very seriously, while many othersdid not.Their arrogance and ignorance will have lethal consequences that humanity willsuffer from.There are no additional threats from other extraterrestrial races, simplybecause they are not interested in us. They are not interested because we havenothing meaningful or important to offer them. Humans live on a linear timeline.This is how and why we understand the universe in terms of time and distance.And this limits us, and prevents us from becoming part and members of the“Cosmic Federation.” Only two races in the known universe can live on Earth: TheAnunnaki and the Grays. In the past, three extraterrestrial races lived here onEarth, for sometime among us.They were:> • a -The Anunnaki;> • b -The Lyrans;> • c -The Grays.Their organism and body structure could survive our atmosphere and itsconditions. Other extraterrestrials would not be able to live on Earth, ashumans would also not be able to live on other known stars systems and planets,because of their atmospheric conditions. Other alien races will self-destruct ifthey try to live on Earth. Consequently, they have no interest whatsoever ininvading or dominating Earth. In other words, the only threat, the only realthreat to humans, come from the Grays.But for the time being, we are safe, because the Grays still need us. Despitetheir highly advanced technology and science, the Grays have not yet found theperfect and final formula for saving themselves, genetically. For someincomprehensible reason, the survival of the Grays depends on two things:> • a -The survival of humans;> • b -The safety of Earth.Because peace on Earth, and the ecological safety of planet Earth affect thestability of the underground/underwater habitat of the Grays themselves. On hybrids and immortality___________________ Can hybrids reach immortality?> • 1.

The Grays are a dying civilization.> • 2. Many of them (Almost the majority) have progeria.> • 3. On earth, progeria is also called Hutchinson-Gilford Syndrome, after the> two scientists who discovered it in 1886.> • 4. Progeria victims are children who age, really become old people, before> they even reach puberty; it is a parent nightmare, but very rare on Earth,> common among the Grays.> • 5. Only one progeria child is born out of four to eight million births.> Rare, and extremely frightening genetic disease, resulting from spontaneous> mutation in the sperm or egg of the parents.> • 6. The horror of this disease is that it has no cure.> • 7. The child is born, starts showing early symptoms, and begins to age right> away.> • 8. The children remain tiny, rarely over four feet, both boys and girls> become bald, and all develop a large cranium, a pointy nose and a receding> chin, resulting in an amazing resemblance to each other, almost as if they> were clones.> • 9. And then they die of old age, mostly in their teens but often before, and> there is nothing anyone can do for them. They develop old age diseases – such> as hardening of the arteries – and often die of strokes or coronary disease,> while their poor parents have to watch helplessly.> • 10. The name progeria is very appropriate. It means ‘before old age,’ and> expresses it very well.> • 11. The civilization of the Grays is millions of years old, and for eons,> they have been degenerating. A huge percentage of their population has> progeria, in varying degrees, and because of that, they are threatened with> extinction.> • 12. No one knows how many Grays are affected, and how many are> progeria-free. We only meet those who are, at least for the present, able to> carry on their duties, with the help of their advanced medical technology. For> all we know, there are millions of sick individuals hidden from view on their> home planet.> • 13. The Grays do not reproduce sexually. They used to, but not anymore.> • 14. Also, they don’t reproduce like the Anunnaki, either. For thousands of> years, they have been relying on cloning. And that has damaged their DNA even> further, creating more and more cases of progeria. They are dying out.> • 15. There are strong similarities between the Grays and the progeria> children of Earth. For one thing, progeria does not produce any form of> dementia.> • 16. Both groups maintain their excellent mental faculties, usually with high> IQ, until they die.> • 17. That is a very important clue, but here are the others for your> consideration:> • 18. Neither group ever grows much beyond four feet.> • 19. Both have fragile, weak bodies, with thin arms and legs; all their bones> are thin, as a general rule.> • 20. Both groups are bald.> • 21. Grays have no sexual reproduction, most have no genitalia at all.> Progeria children never reach puberty.> • 22. Both have large heads by comparison to their bodies.> • 23. Both have receding chins and pointy noses. Within their groups, they> closely resemble each other. The Grays are cloned; the progeria children look> as if they could have been cloned.> • 24. The Grays believe that the experiments on abductees will help them> survive.> • 25. They take the eggs and the sperm from humans and combine them with> Grays’ DNA. Thus, they create the hybrid children.> • 26. The hybrid children are closer to the Grays in their character and> behavior than they are to humans.> • 27. The first generation hybrids are smaller than human children. They tend> to follow the growth pattern of the Gray parent.> • 28. They are even smaller than progeria babies. The retardation of growth> begins before birth.> • 29. First generation means that they go on mixing the genetic material.> • 30. The Hybrids may or may not have progeria, but naturally, the more human> DNA is mixed into the species, the more chances of eliminating the bad genes> exist.> • 31. So they breed the Hybrids with more human DNA, always hoping to> eradicate the disease, never quite succeeding. That is why they have to get> fresh human specimens all the time.> • 32. They have no chance of survival. They are doomed.> • 33. Some governments on Earth arte fully aware of this situation. They have> made a deal with the Grays. They supply them with humans. Usually, these> victims are retarded people, prostitutes, homeless, etc.> • 34. In exchange, the Grays give them the technology they crave for.> • 35. Some of the most up to date scientific discoveries and inventions were> given to governments by the Grays.> • 36. They have learned so much from the Grays, and they mostly use it for> military purposes.> • 37. Humans are not kind to each other. Look at wars, torture, genocide,> holocausts… all part of human history, and still taking place.> • 38. There are various places on earth where such activities can be studied,> various military bases, underground mostly, in many countries.> • 39. There are no hybrid bases anywhere else, except on planet Earth,> certainly not on Nibiru.> • 40. Earth is the lowest habitat in the universe.> • 41.

Hybrids habitats are found in isolated areas on Earth and underwater.> • 3. Hybrids are under the direct control of the Grays.> • 4. The Anunnaki have no relation and no contact with Hybrids.> • 5. Some Anunnaki Sinhars have visited the underwater bases of the hybrids.> • 6. Upon visiting the underwater bases, the Anunnaki pass through a> tunnel-lock that is safe for both water and air.> • 7. The Grays as well as visitors enter a huge, hangar-like room. This is the> main entrance of the base.> • 8. The rooms are of beige and gray colors, all metal and have no windows.> • 9. The rooms are huge, and are used for different kinds of operations.> • 10. You could call them hellish laboratories.> • 11. Visitors walk to a solid wall, put their hands on it. The wall shimmers> a little and then moves, allowing a door to form and open.> • 12. The door will take you to a long corridor, illuminated by stark, white> light, with many regular doors on each side.> • 13.

The room is filled with> tables, and chairs. It is scrupulously clean.> • 15. When the tables open up, each table reveals a deep groove on each of its> long sides.> • 16.

They are divided into three distinct groups.> • 28. The three groups consist:> • a- Early-stage hybrids,> • b- Middle-stage hybrids,> • c- Late-stage hybrids.> • 29. The first group is born from the first combination of abductees’ and> Grays’ DNA. They closely resemble the Grays.> • 30. The grayish color is very close to that of the Grays, and so is the> facial structure.> • 31. The second group, the middle-stage hybrids, are the result of mating> between these early-stage ones, once they are old enough for reproduction, and> human abductees.> • 32. The resulting DNA is closer to humans, and so they look much more like> humans, and many of them lose the progeria gene.> • 33. The third group, the late-stage hybrid, is the most important.> Middle-stage hybrids are mated with humans to create them, and they can hardly> be distinguished from humans.> • 34. However, it is easy to recognize the late-stagers, but there are not too> many of them here.> • 35. A large number of these hybrids, who represent the most successful> results of the experiments, are placed for adoption with human families.> • 36.

But they receive no love, no individual attention, there is no real> parenting, and the environment is barren and depressing.> • 44. They live peacefully until they are old enough to be of use in the> experiments. Not a very nice life for any child.> • 45. Only the hybrids who are entirely free of progeria are adopted by human> families.> • 46. Many of the progeria stricken late-stagers are killed, since their> progeria gene is too strong.> • 47. The Grays believe the hybrid children somehow will save their> civilization. But they are doomed.> • 48. The children finish eating in complete silence.

Then they spray the tables and floor with a liquid that smells like a> disinfectant. The room is once again spotless, and ready for the next sad,> depressing meal.> • 53. Their dormitories look like a place that you can describe as a> combination of an old-fashioned orphanage and military barracks on Earth.> • 54. The dormitory is always a very large room, but the ceiling is not high,> only about twelve feet.> • 55. Again, everything is beige and gray, and there are no windows to relieve> the monotony.> • 56. The room is full of beds, arranged above each other in groups of three,> like in a submarine.> • 57. Dozens and dozens of such rows stretch to a very long distance.> • 58. The beds are made of metal, very smooth, and of silver-gray color. They> are assembled like your prefab furniture.> • 59. The beds which are stacked on the top of each other have no ladders.> • 60. To reach the upper levels, the hybrid children levitate.> • 61. Part of each bed is magnetic, so each child can have his or her toys> attached to it. As for the lower beds, the toys are stored next to them.> • 62. The Grays have discovered that mental stimulation is highly important to> the hybrids’ development. There are plenty of other activities, mostly with> abductees, that relieve their lives of the tedium, at least to a certain> extent, but they have no privacy at all.> • 63. The hybrid children only get their own room when they are more mature,> but they have one thing that pleases them.

The hybrid children usually sit on the floor of the bubble. The floor is> made from sand.> • 67. The children play with normal human toys – trucks, cars, trains, and> multi colored buckets.

They also have rooms with climbing equipment, and places to play ball.> It is needed to strengthen their bones and muscles.> Statements by Ambar Anati:Author’s note: Ambar Anati who has visited the children hybrids said: “Iapproached the children, a little apprehensively, worrying that I might frightenthe poor things.They looked up at me, seemingly waiting for me to do something but I was pleasedto realize that they were not afraid. I sat on the sand, took some stones thatwere scattered around, and arranged them so that they created a little road.The children stared at me for a minute with their strange, wise eyes, as iftrying to read my thoughts, and almost instantly grasped the idea and continuedto build the road together. None of them smiled, but they seemed very muchengaged in the new activity. Once all the stones were used, they looked at meagain, as if trying to absorb information, and sure enough, after a minute theytook the trucks and make them travel on the little road. I got up and let themplay.“So they can read minds,” I said to Sinhar Inannaschamra.“To an extent,” she said. “At this age, they basically just absorb images youproject. You probably thought about the trucks going on this road, and they sawit.”“And everything was done together, as if they were mentally connected,” I said.“Do they do everything together?”“Yes, everything is communal, even the bathrooms where they clean themselves.But don’t be too upset about it. If they are separated from each other beforetheir adolescence, they are extremely upset. It is almost as if the onset ofpuberty makes them an individual, and before that they have a group mentality.”“They are not unhappy,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Only as adolescents, whenthey break off the communal mind, they understand how unhappy they are.But we will visit the adolescents on another occasion.” On the Grays’ fetuses storage: > • How the Grays store fetuses?> • Is there a special room for this?> • Is this room located in secret military bases as many abductees have> reported?> • 1. The fetuses storage room is a hangar-sized room, full of tanks.> • 2. Each tank contains liquid nutrients.> • 3. This is where they put the fetuses, as soon as they are removed from the> abductees.> • 4. The tanks are arranged in order, from the youngest fetuses to those that> are almost ready to be removed.> • 5. They separate them into their stages.> • 6. This room is for early stagers only.> • 7. In other rooms, they have the middle stagers. But the late stagers remain> in the mother’s womb until birth, to make them as close to humans as possible.> • 8. The babies are q uiet, not as responsive as human babies. Many of them> die as soon as they are removed from the tank.> • 9. The babies who survive are generally mentally well developed, physically> weak, and emotionally subdued.”> • 10. Both Grays and abductees take care of them.> • 11. Always, the Grays perform most of the physical requirements, but the> abductees supply the human touch. On the Grays’ abduction and their laboratories:What is going there in the Grays base? Is it a base, a laboratory, hospital orwhat? And what kind of operations or surgery they perform on abductees? Theanswers and description were provided by Anunnaki Sinhar Inannaschamra:Sinhar Inannaschamra said to Anati: “The first thing we must talk about is thesituation with the Grays.”“The small extraterrestrials with the bug eyes, right?” said Anati. “Yes. Theydo not contact people like we do, on your planet. They abduct them. You arefamiliar with many stories that come from the people that they have abducted,but much of what these people say is inaccurate, and based upon mind controlthat the Grays exercise on them. I am going to tell you a bit, and then, if youfeel up to it, we will take a short trip on my spaceship and visit one of theirlabs.”“Would they let you in? Aren’t they dangerous?”“Dangerous? Very. But not to an Anunnaki.We are much stronger and they are afraid of us. If I come to their place anddemand to see a lab, I will see a lab. In addition, I want to show you a fewthings on a monitor.Some will be extremely unpleasant, but it cannot be avoided if you want to learnsomething.”“What do they want of us on earth?”“There are a few things that they want. First, they want eggs from human womenand use them to create hybrids. Let’s take a look at this monitor, and I’ll showyou how they do that. But Victoria, steel yourself. This is pretty horrible,even though I have seen even worse. You will also be able to hear, it is like atelevision.”The monitor blinked and buzzed, and a small white dot appeared on the screen. Itenlarged itself, moved back and forth, and settled into a window-like view of ahuge room, but the view was still rather fuzzy. I heard horrendous screams andfroze in my seat, these were sounds I have never heard before.After a few minutes the view cleared and I saw what seemed to be a hospitalroom, but it was rounded, not square. Only part of it was revealed, as it waselongated and the far edge was not visible. The walls on the side were movingback and forth, like some kind of a balloon that was being inflated and deflatedperiodically, with a motion that made me dizzy; they seemed sticky, even gooey.The room was full of operation tables, of which I could see perhaps forty orfifty, on which were stretched human beings, each attached to the table andunable to move, but obviously not sedated, since they were screaming or moaning.Everyone was attached to tubes, into which blood was pouring in huge quantities.I noticed that some of the blood was turning into a filthy green color, likerotting vegetation. At the time I could not understand what that was, but laterthat day I found out. This blood was converted to a suitable type for some ofthe aliens that paid the Grays to collect it, and it was not useful in its rawcondition.The people who operated these experiments were small and gray, and they had bigbug eyes and pointy faces without any expression. I thought they looked morelike insects than like a humanoid species. They wore no clothes, and their skinwas shiny and moist, like that of an amphibian on earth. It visibly exuded beadsof moisture which they did not bother to wipe away. Each operating table hadcomplicated machinery that was poised right on top of the person who wasstrapped to it. On some of the tables, the machinery was lowered so that needlescould be extracted from them automatically, and the needles reached every partof the human bodies, faces, eyes, ears, genitals, stomach. The people screamedas they saw the needles approaching them, some of them fainted. Many of thepeople were already dead, I could swear to that. Others were still alive butbarely so, and some had arms and legs amputated from their bodies. It was clearthat once the experiment was over, every single person there will die. I don’tknow how I could continue to look, but somehow I managed. I looked at theceiling of this slaughter house and saw meat hooks, on which arms and legs andeven heads were hanging, like a butcher’s warehouse. On the side of the tableswere large glass tanks where some organs were placed, possibly hearts, livers,or lungs, all preserved in liquids.The workers were doing their job dispassionately and without any feelings,moving around like ants and making buzzing sounds at each other as theyconversed.They were entirely business-like and devoid of emotion. At least, their huge bugeyes did not convey any emotion to me, neither did their expressionless faces.I watched until I could no longer tolerate it, and finally covered my eyes andcried out, “Why don’t you stop it? Why don’t you interfere?”Sinhar Inannaschamra turned the monitor off. “This event is a record fromdecades ago, Victoria. It is not happening now as we look. And even though oftenwe do interfere, we cannot police the entire universe or even the entire earth.They know how to hide from us. And you must understand, that often the victimscooperate with their abductors.”“Why would they?”“Basically, through mind control. The Grays have many ways to convince thevictims. The Grays can enter the human mind quite easily, and they find what theabductees are feeling and thinking about various subjects. Then, they can eitherthreaten them by various means, or persuade them by a promise of reward.”“Reward? What can they possibly offer?”“Well, you see, they show the victims images through a monitor, just like thisone. They tell them that they can send them through a gate, which is controlledby the monitor, to any number of universes, both physical and non-physical. Thatis where the reward come in.For example, if the abductees had originally reacted well to images of Mary orJesus, the Grays can promise them the joy of the non-physical dimensions. Theyshow them images of a place where Mary and Jesus reside, where all the saints orfavorite prophets live, and even the abode of God. They promise the abducteesthat if they cooperate, they could live in this non-physical universe inperpetual happiness with their deities. Many fall for that.”“And if they resist?”“Then they show them the non-physical alternative, which is Hell. Would you liketo see some of it?”“You can show me Hell?” I asked, amazed.“No, there is no such thing as Hell… it’s a myth that religions often exploited.But I can show you what the Grays show the abductees, pretending it is hell;they are quite devious, you know. You see, some creatures live in differentdimensions, where our laws do not apply. Sometimes, they escape to otherdimensions.These beings have no substance in their new dimensions, and they need some kindof bodies to function. At the same time, the Grays can tap into numerousuniverses, because they can control their own molecules to make them move andnavigate through any dimension.Well, a cosmic trade had been developed. The Grays supply the substance takenfrom human abductees, and from the blood of cattle. You must have heard ofcattle mutilation, where carcasses of cows are found in the fields, entirelydrained of blood? The Grays do it for their customers.”“How do these creatures pay the Grays?”“By various services. Once they get their substance, they are incrediblypowerful in a physical sense. The old tales of genies who can lift buildings andfly with them through the air were based on these demons; the Grays often have ause for such services. But let me show you a few of these creatures. Of course,you can only see them when they have already acquired some substance from theGrays.”The monitor hummed again as Sinhar Inannaschamra turned it on. The white dotexpanded into its window, which now, for some reason, was larger and took overthe entire screen. All I could see was white fog with swirls floating throughit. Sometimes the fog changed from white to gray, then to white again.I started hearing moans. Not screams, nothing that suggested the kind ofphysical pain I saw before, but perhaps just as horrible, since they voiceswhere those of hopelessness, despair, and emotional anguish. Every so often Iheard a sound that suggested a banshee’s wail, or keen, as described in Irishfolklore.“It will take a while for someone to show up,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Mostof them have no substance, and therefore they are invisible. Others have ashadowy substance. Then, there are the others… but you will see in a minute.Once they notice they are being watched, they will flock to the area, since theyare desperate to get out. Incidentally, it was never made quite clear to me howthey produce sounds without bodies, we are still trying to find out what themechanics are, but it’s not easy, because we would rather not go there inperson.”“They sound horribly sad,” I said.“This is what makes it so hell-like. In many cultures, Hell never had any fireand brimstone and tormenting devils, but rather, it was a place of acuteloneliness, lack of substance, and alienation from anything that could sustainthe individual from a spiritual point of view. Think of the Greek Hades, or theancient Hebrew Sheol, before the Jews made their Hell more like the Christianone. Look, here comes the first creature. Poor thing, he is a shadow.”I saw a vaguely humanoid shape in deep gray. It seemed to have arms, which itwaved in our direction. It seemed fully aware of the monitor. Then anothershadow, then another, all shoving each other and waving desperately at themonitor. Then something more substantial came into view, and I jumped back as ifit could reach me. It seemed to be a severed arm.Cautiously, I came back, and then saw that the arm was attached to a shadowbody. I looked at Sinhar Inannaschamra, speechless, and she said, “Yes, here yousee one that managed to receive an arm. It wants to complete its body, ofcourse, so that it can get out of this dimension and serve the Grays, but theGrays keep them waiting until they want them.”More and more came, clamoring for attention. “Do they think we are Grays?” Iasked.“Yes, they do. They can’t tell the difference, all they know is that they arewatched, and they try to get the attention of the watchers. It’s incrediblycruel, but if you feel for them, which I still do, remember that at the sametime they become murderous, cruel creatures themselves as soon as they escapetheir dimension and join the Grays.”Another half thing came into view. It had eyes stuck in the middle of ahalf-formed face, each eye different. The face seemed mutilated, somehow, untilI realized it had no nose and no chin. Floating heads, arms, legs, torsos – theyall jostled in front of the monitor, each more horrible than the other. And thenI saw the worst thing imaginable.“Sinhar Inannaschamra!” I screamed. “This is a baby’s head! A floating baby’shead! What in the world it is attached to?”“Another shadow,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “They don’t care what age thesubstance comes from. Sometime the babies’ heads or limbs get attached to bigadult bodies.”“They use babies,” I said, sobbing. “Babies…”“Yes, this is the kind of creatures we have to contend with,” said SinharInannaschamra. She looked at me and realized I could not take any more of thisHell, and so turned off the monitor.“This was something,” I said, shivering and trying to recover. “Indeed,” saidSinhar Inannaschamra. “So you see, they can easily show them horrific picturesof Hell, enough to frighten them to such an extent, that they are sure to obey.Interestingly, the abductees, under such threats, often develop physical,psychosomatic effect in the form of scratches, burns, or even stigmata, on partsof their bodies.Of course, sometimes the Grays burn them with laser beams as a form ofpunishment or of persuasion, and sometimes the wounds are produced simply by theradioactive rays emanating from the spaceship, like what sometimes happens innuclear plants on earth, or during nuclear explosions. But most often it is themind reacting to the image.”“How horrible…” I said weakly.“It gets worse,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “They can show them the physicaluniverse as well. They would project, on screen, well-known events that occurredduring times in which humanity was utterly cruel, or when war, famines, andplagues ravished the earth. They might show them the Crusades, or Attila theHun, or the Nazi concentration camps, or the famine in Ireland, or the blackplague in Europe, and threaten them that they can open a gate through themonitor, and abandon them there for the rest of their lives.”“The poor things. No wonder they obey,” I said.“Yes, you see, the Anunnaki tell you the truth when they contact you. They letyou know that they cannot change the past, nor can they interfere with thefuture. But the Grays lie. They tell the abductees that they can change eventsin the past, from day one, and that they could project and change life at two,five, or ten thousand years in the future of humanity.”“I wish you would just wipe them of the face of the universe,” I said.“We don’t do such things. Some of us recommend it, but we just don’t. Anyway,they have other systems of persuasion. Some women have a very strong reaction tothe images of children. The Grays catch it, of course, and then they tell thewomen that they have been abducted before, years ago, and were impregnated bythe Grays. Then they show them a hybrid child and tell them that this is theirown child.Many of the abductees who are thus psychologically influenced fall into apathological attachment to the hybrid child. Then the Grays tell them that ifthey don’t fully cooperate, they will take the child away. The woman cooperates,the experiment takes place, and then the Grays make them forget the child andplace them back in their beds at home.Usually, some vague memory remains, since the Grays don’t care about the wellbeing of their victims and don’t bother to check if the memory is completelycleaned out.”“But it is not really their child?”“Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn’t. You must realize that normal impregnationand the nine months of carrying the baby does not occur. The Grays take the eggsout of the woman, the way you just saw it on the monitor, put them in a tube,fertilize it by an electric or sometimes atomic way, and the hybrid grows in thetube until it is of term. No woman has ever given birth to a hybrid.”“This is beyond words,” I said. “And I thought most of the extraterrestrialswould be like you.”“There are many species,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. There are those humans call‘The Nordic,’ they look and behave much like humans, they are rather kindly, andother kinds are reasonable as well.But there are a lot of horrible species. The closer any species get to thedemonic dimension, and particularly if they trade with them, the worse theybecome. Some look reptilian, some insect-like. Some eat human beings and othersentient species, in what we see as almost cannibalistic behavior. Some makesacrifices of sentient beings to their deities. The reptilians have aspecialized digestive system. They don’t eat solid food, but only suck bloodthrough pores in their fingers. That is why some researchers on earth connectthe extraterrestrials with vampirism.The Grays sell them cattle blood, since the reptilians don’t particularly carewhere the blood comes from. But anyway, are you ready for your field trip? Let’sgo and visit a Grays’ lab.”I thought I was ready. I thought I was tough. But what I saw on this field tripwould remain with me for eons.Sinhar Inannaschamra took me to her spaceship, and informed me that the tripwould be very short. She had been to this lab before, and knew the conditionsvery well. Just before we landed, she pulled out a suit that was needed toprotect me from any radiation.Apparently, for this trip, she needed no protection herself, but she could nottell as yet if I could tolerate such conditions or not, due to my humanexistence for the last thirty years. The suit was made of lightweight, softmetallic material that was actually rather comfortable and moved easily with me.Then, I put on a helmet, which was entirely transparent and allowed me perfectvision.We landed on a bleak field covered with some material that looked much likecement, gray and unpleasant, but with a smoother finish. Right before us was ahuge building which looked like an ugly airport hangar, completely utilitarianwithout any ornamentation. The entire area around it was an empty prairie-likefield with stunted, grayish vegetation, stretching into the horizon without anyfeature like a mountain or a city. The sky was gray but without clouds. Wewalked to a large door, tightly closed and made of metal. Sinhar Inannaschamraput her hand on it, and it slid immediately to the side and allowed us to comein. “They know my hand print,” she said to me. We entered a small hall, empty ofany furniture, and from there, a door opened into a long corridor, brightly litand painted white. On each side there were doors, also painted white, allclosed, and it was entirely empty of any occupants. Sinhar Inannaschamra led theway to one of the doors, and again placed her hand on it. The door slid opensilently, and we entered an enormous room. It was so huge that I could not seethe end of it, and had gray walls and a white ceiling. Round, bright lights oflarge circumference were placed in the ceiling, emanating a very strongillumination. The impression the room gave was that of a hospital ward, or asurgical hall, but there were no beds or operation tables, only large tankscontaining some objects I could not as yet see.And while the place was scrupulously clean, the smell was nightmarish. Irecognized the stench of formaldehyde, mingled with some other malodorousliquids. I was surprised I could smell anything through the helmet, but SinharInannaschamra explained that they deliberately made the suits and the helmetsallow as much interaction with the environment as possible.“It smells like that because this is the warehouse, where they keep all thespare parts,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Come, look at this tank.”We approached an enormous tank, transparent in the front parts and increasinglyopaque as it extended further into the room. Inside floated a large number ofsevered arms and legs, all human. I recoiled in horror, but quickly recovered.We went to the next tank. It was arranged in the same manner, but inside floatedsevered heads and torsos.And so it went on, each tank filled with body parts, some even with full bodies.Smaller containers had interior organs, such as livers, hearts, and some othersI was not sure of.In addition, there were containers of blood, some red, some green. I alreadyknew that the green blood was like that after preparation for sale to speciesthat needed the adjustments.Suddenly I heard sounds of conversation, as if a group of people wereapproaching us from somewhere. The sounds were in a language I could notunderstand, and uttered in a metallic, screeching way that was almostmechanical. To me, it sounded demonic and inhuman. A group of five Graysapproached us. After what I have seen on the monitor, I was about to escape interror, but the group bowed to Sinhar Inannaschamra, and went on about theirbusiness. One of them approached a tank. He looked at what seemed to be a chart,like a hospital chart but in a language I could not understand, that waspositioned above the tank, and just stared at it for a short while. A line onthe chart lit up, and some equipment that was build above the tank came down,entered the tank, and using a robotic hand pulled out a specimen and placed itin a tube, along with some of the liquid. Then the robotic hand came up, movedforward, and handed the tube to the Gray. The Gray took the tube, looked at thechart, and the robotic hand withdrew.The Gray took the tube to a wall and placed the tube against it. To myamazement, the wall sort of swallowed the tube and it disappeared.I looked at Sinhar Inannaschamra for explanation, and she said, “The walls arenot solid. They look solid, of course, but really they are constructed ofenergy. The Grays can move things back and forth, and even pass through itthemselves. Some of the walls contain drawers, where they place equipment.”The other Grays were all communicating among themselves in their demoniclanguage, mostly ignoring us. “Let’s go to the next room, where I can show youwhat they do with their specimens,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra.We went to the wall and she put her hand on it while holding me with her otherhand, and I found myself passing through the wall as if it was made of thickmolasses.The room we entered was designed just like the others, architecturally, but hadwork tables instead of tanks and containers. Hundreds of Grays stood there, eachat his table, doing things to the limbs, torsos, and blood.The smell of formaldehyde was so intense that I almost fainted. “Here,” saidSinhar Inannaschamra. “Let me adjust the helmet so you don’t have to smell theliquid.” She did something at the back of the helmet, and I felt better.“And now, let’s go to the area where they fit the spare parts on the creatures Ihave shown you, the ones that want to buy substance,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra.We stepped into a third room, again through the wall, and this was a muchsmaller room.On the walls, there were a number of monitors, just like the ones in SinharInannaschamra’s office, but much larger.Before each monitor stood a Gray. We walked to one of them, and the Gray bowedto Sinhar Inannaschamra, and returned to his work. The Gray adjusted something,and a swirling shadow attached to one leg appeared on the screen. Behind himwere numerous other shadows, but the Gray managed to separate the first creaturefrom the others with some walls of energy that looked like white fog. Thecreature waved desperately at the Gray, who had before him a torso in liquid. Alarge robotic hand came from above the monitor, picked up the torso, and allowedthe liquid to drain into its container. Then, he passed the torso through thescreen, which now I realized was made of energy, like the wall, and placed it onthe shadow. The shadow shivered, as if in pain, and I heard a deep moan or sigh,as the torso attached itself to the swirling gray form. I had a glimpse of ashadowy face, contorted in agony, but whether it was physical or mental pain Idid not know. The shadow seemed utterly exhausted by the bizarre procedure, andfloated away.“What will happen to it now?” I asked.“It will be back again and again, and when the Gray decide, they will give itmore parts, allowing it to adjust and become more substantial.”“Are there any of them ready to leave and serve the Grays?”“Yes, but I think this would be too dangerous to visit in person. The demoniccreatures don’t have the restraints the Grays have, regarding the Anunnaki, andoften they are too stupid and just lash out as soon as they are brought into ourdimension. Their transport, therefore, is done in a different part of the lab,under tremendous precautions. Besides, we don’t want to stay much longer, sinceI think you had seen enough for one day…” I could not agree with her more, andwe retraced our steps back to the spaceship.“Next time I will show you how the creatures are taken out and put to service,”said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Only not in person.” This sounded good to me. I wasalready so shaken from my day’s adventures, I did not think I could take muchmore instruction, nor did I have a wish to meet such creatures in person. But,of course, I knew that one day I would have to do exactly that.*** *** ***ON THE BENE HA ELOHIM AND THE ANUNNAKI> • Who are the Bene Elohim?> • Any relation to the Anunnaki?> • Are they angels or demons? Bene ha-Elohim and the extraterrestrials:I. Hebraic Definition and introductionII. Sons of God in Canaanite traditionsIII. The “bene ha 'elohim”, the Nephilim and the extraterrestrial AnunnakiIV. The Rephaim___________________ I. Hebraic definition and introduction:As stated in Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls, Early Rabbis saw \"bene ha'elohim\" as referring to righteous men, not as the \"Sons of God.\" The Churchfathers understood it as referring to the descendants of Seth. Both are kind ofinteresting because neither want to address that gods mated with humans andproduced offspring. The phrase \"bene ha 'elohim\" and its variant \"bene 'elim\" isfound in other passages in the Bible, such as Job 1:6 and 2:1. Here, the Sons ofGod present themselves to Yahweh in the heavenly divine assembly. Job 38:7 saysthat the Sons of God have been with Yahweh at the creation of the world.They also appear in Psalm 89:7, where Yahweh is proclaimed incomparable to allother gods, and in Psalm 29:1 where the bene 'elim sing praises to Yahweh. Thepassage in Deuteronomy (32:8) reads \"When the Most High apportioned the nations,when he divided the sons of man. He established the borders of the peoplesaccording to the number of the sons of Israel.\"The weird thing about this passage is how can the borders of all the peoples beestablished according to the sons of Israel when Israel hadn't already beenestablished? The end seems to contradict the beginning. This contradictiondoesn't appear in all Bibles, like the RSV based on the Greek Septuagint (datedfrom the 3rd century BCE), which state \"according to the number of the Sons ofGod.\"This is also the wording in the Hebrew DSS version, which is now the oldestversion of Deuteronomy we currently have, and what scholars now believe as themost authentic. The implications are that the Sons of God are not just presentat the beginning of the world, but also figure prominently in dividing nations.That implicates that while Yahweh chose Israel as his nation, each of the otherSons of God also received a nation to rule over. II. Sons of God in Canaanite traditions:Krista stated that Canaanite traditions also use the term \"Sons of God\" (\"Banuili\" or \"Banu ili-mi\") in their texts dating back to the 14th century BCE. Inthe Canaanite pantheon, the chief god is El, meaning God, and his wife isAsherah. The phrase Sons of God can then be translated as the children of El.There are also references in Phoenician inscriptions of the 7-8th centuries BCE- Arslan Tash (KAI 27.II) and Karatepe (KAI 26.A.III.19) and in an Ammoniteinscription of the 9th century found in Amman, Jordan. This may be an earliertradition that Biblical phrase pulls from. III. The Bene ha 'elohim, Nephilim and extraterrestrial Anunnaki :Advocates of alternative archeology, as well as many ufologists claim that the“bene ha 'elohim” were the Nephilim, who were the extraterrestrial Anunnaki.Now, in Genesis 6:1-4, the offspring of the Sons of God and the daughters of menare called Nephilim[http://www.deliriumsrealm.com/delirium/articleview.asp?Post=186] , who are the\"heros of old, the men of renown.\" Literally, the word Nephilim means \"thefallen ones\" and is a common euphemism for \"the dead\" in Hebrew.For example, in Jeremiah 6:15, “They will fall among the fallen (Hebrew,Nopelim).” In Ezekiel 32:27, the Nephilim are fallen warriors: “They lie withthe warriors, The Nephilim of old, who descend to Sheol with their weapons ofwar.” Elsewhere, the Nephilim are giants who were native inhabitants of Canaan.In Numbers 13:33, they advise Moses \"All the people whom we saw in its midstwere people of great size there we saw the Nephilim - the Anaqim are part of theNephilim - and we seemed in our own eyes like grasshoppers, and so we must haveseemed in their eyes.\" IV. The Rephaim :The Rephaim were also referred to as the Nephilim, the Anakim, and the Anunnaki.The Habiru (Early Hebrews) view the Rephaim as the “bene ha 'elohim”, and theBiblical giants were called by the Habiru, the Rephaim. In Deuteronomy 2:11, thegiant Anakim are called Rephaim, and two of the most famous of the Raphaim areKing Og of Bashan, whose huge iron bed could still be seen on display in Rabbahof Ammon (Deuteronomy 3:11) and the warrior Goliath, who descended from theRaphah in Gath (2 Samuel 21:19ff). Thus, it would seem that the Nephilim wereboth the race of heroes who lived before the Flood and in Canaan before theIsraelites conquered the Promised Land. The Rephaim and Anakim were defeated byJoshua, Moses, and Caleb, and then the rest by David. Joshua 11:22 says that \"NoAnaqim remained in the land of Israel, but some remained in Gaza, Gath, andAshdod.\" *** *** ***Shape-shifting “Ibra-Anu” I. Definition and introduction:For extraterrestrials, shape-shifting is necessary. Ambar Anati said verbatim(As is and unedited): “Shape-shifting includes skin color change, organs size,general physical appearances, but not the functionality of the body. TheAnunnaki can easily shape-shift themselves. This is absolutely necessary forclimatic and atmospheric reasons.Each planet has its own climate, temperature and atmosphere. Consequently thebody must adapt to these environment conditions. II. Anunnaki’s shape-shifting:When they visit Earth, the Anunnaki slightly change their physical appearances,not so much, because in general, they look like us, except their eyes are muchbigger, and their height is far more superior and taller to the size and heightof humans. Some Anunnaki are 9 foot tall. Even their women are extremely tall byhuman standard. Some women are 8 foot tall. When they travel to other planets,minor changes are required. For instance, when they get out of their galaxy andvisit the planets Niftar, Marshan-Haloum and Ibra-Anu, they change the color oftheir skin, and the shape of their hands.On Niftar (Niftari), inhabitants have grey-blue color skin and 3 fingers in eachhand. The fingers are long, thin and beneath the skin, there are millions ofmicroscopic hair filaments and pores (orifices) that help them hold on slipperysurfaces like glass and wet areas. Anunnaki look very different from the Zetasand the numerous alien races that have visited the earth. In this context, theynever appear or manifest like reptilians or short “Greys”.It is easy to recognize an Anunnaki, because he usually appears like a tallwarrior; his vest is made out of thin layers of metal called “Handar”. He wearsa long robe “Arbiya” of dark colors and underneath, it a sort of pans with widecontour. On his wrist, you always notice a navigation tool. Many of theextraterrestrial races wear tight outfits, almost glued to their skin.Anunnaki don’t. The “Greys” are notorious for shape-shifting. They can appearlike a reptile, an insect and even like humans. The Anunnaki can transmute andmanipulate their bodies if needed. This happens very rarely. And in manyinstances, they don’t need to do so, because they are already known by so manygalactic and outer-galactic civilizations, and seen by inhabitants of millionsand millions of stars, planets and moons. They are superstars in their ownrights.Aliens of lower dimensions need to manipulate their bodiy-type to enter theatmosphere of other planets, particularly underwater and a multitude ofunderground environments and habitats.This is exactly what happens all the time with the “Greys” who live on earth andwork with scientists in restricted areas such as underground genetic labs, andmilitary research centers and bases. One of their striking characteristics isclaustrophobia. *** *** ***Extraterrestrials in the Book of Ramadosh “Ezakarfalki”, “E-zakar-falki” I. Definition and introductionII. Evolution of the extraterrestrials and the human racesIII. Extraterrestrial races populated the EarthIV. Extraterrestrials of the sea (Underwater)V. Senses of the extraterrestrialsVI. Talking to extraterrestrials _____________________ I. Definition and introduction:Term for extraterrestrials as mentioned in “Book of Ramadosh.” Per contra,inhabitants of planet Earth are called Ezakarerdi or Ezakar.Ki.In terrestrial vocabulary, extraterrestrial(s) is a term applied to anyentity(ies), object(s), substance(s), life-form(s), intelligence, and presencethat have originated from beyond planet Earth. Grosso modo, referred to asalien(s). Contemporary ufology etymology added extraterrestrial origins comingfrom outer-space, other planets, stars, galaxies, and dimensions.The word extraterrestrial is composed from three words:> • a -Extra, which is derived from the Latin word Extra, which means outside;> additional; beyond.> • b -Terrestri, derived from the Latin Terrestris, which means pertaining to> earth; belonging to earth; earthly; made out of earth, itself derived from the> Latin words Terranum and Terrenum, which are derived from the word Terra,> which means earth; ground; piece of land; soil. (Note: From the Latin word Terrenum, derived the French word Terrain; and fromthe French word derived the English word terrain.) > • c -Al, an English addition.(Note: The Latin word Terra originally derived from the Arabic word “Tourab”(Terrab), which means dirt; dust; earth, itself derived from the Arabic wordTourba (Terrba), which means a piece of land, originally derived from the Ana’khword Turbah, pronounced Toorbaah, which means dirt from planet Earth. In theSumerian/Akkadian epics and mythologies, the words dirt and earth refer to clay;the very clay found in abundance in ancient Iraq that was used by the Anunnakito genetically create the human race. II. Evolution of the extraterrestrials and the human races:The evolution of aliens, and the extraterrestrial races on many galaxies evolvedinter-dimensionally by copying, duplicating, and cloning themselves andfertilizing their own genes. On other planets, more advanced extraterrestrialcivilizations multiply and prosper through the development of brain’s waves andthoughts frequencies.They did not need to immigrate to other planets in order to survive, and/or torecreate (Reshape) themselves, as mistakenly claimed by some ufologists,extraterrestrialogists, mediums, and channelers, for they did not encounterinsurmountable ecological or bio-organic catastrophes on their own planets orstars. Zetas and Anunnaki did alter their genetics but, not for survivalpurposes or for intra-planetary travel-immigration readiness reasons. Thealteration came as cause and effect, much needed to reach a higher level ofawareness and scientific advancement. III. Extraterrestrial races populated the Earth:Some 300,000 years before the creation of the cities of “The Women of Lights,”forty-six different races of humans and quasi-humans populated the earth. Thegreatest numbers were found in Africa, Madagascar, Indonesia, Brazil, andAustralia. These quasi-human races died out not because of famine, ecologicalcatastrophes, or acts of war, but because of the disintegration of the verymolecules and composition of their cells. The Anunnaki created the ‘final form’of human beings, and all of us are their descendants. IV. Extraterrestrials of the sea (Underwater):According to Sinhar Ambar Anati, the extraterrestrials of the sea are not ourancestors and creators, the Anunnaki. They belong to a different race; one ofthe 46 different alien races that have visited the earth at its dawn. Only 7specific races remained on Earth.They have many things in common, and share non-physical similarities, but aredifferent from the Anunnaki. According to ufology literature, the aliens whocurrently work with terrestrial scientists have extraterrestrial physiognomy,totally alien to the human race. The original Anunnaki no longer live on earth.They left our planet thousands of years ago. However, many of their off springs,bloodlines, descendants and hybrid remnants live among us, today.Ulema Sadqi said: “The Anunnaki are not very much different from the humanbeings. They are not reptilians at all, and they don’t look like the ZetaReticulians, as erroneously depicted in the West. They have a human shape, yetthey are capable to shape shifting when needed.” V. Senses of the extraterrestrials:Anunnaki-Ulema Wah Lin stated that the extraterrestrials have an astonishingrange of senses; for instance: > • a -The Artyrians have 13 different kinds of senses, ranging from> physio-biological to mental-sensorial, yet, they are neither psychosomatic nor> neurological.> • b -The Naryans have 17 senses.> • c -The Anunnaki have 26 extra-senses and a multitude of meta-bio-organic> faculties.” Ulema Li adds: “Some of the most fascinating senses are:> • a -The ability of freeing themselves from the limitation of time and space> and sensing the “ultra dimension”; in other words, they are able to feel and> sense the infinitesimal frequencies that constitute the dividing waves or> walls between each dimension and/or multiple universes. Those dividing lines> are waves and they expand and react spatially like rubber bands. There are no> other words or expressions in the human vocabularies we can use to describe> these “existences”.> • b -They can totally eliminate the effect of heat and cold and mentally> regulate the temperature degrees of the environment in any sphere. Also they> can adjust others bodies’ temperature for health and therapeutic reasons> because they can sense the body’s weaknesses and strengths. In terrestrial> terms, they can see the aura. But it goes beyond aura, because aura is> produced bio-organically and can be detected either visually or through> scientific apparatus. VI. Talking to extraterrestrials:Anunnaki and extraterrestrials have no intention whatsoever in engaging into adialogue with ordinary human beings. If they have an agenda, and/or are on amission, they either abduct (Not the Anunnaki) humans, or directly contactscientists working with them in secret facilities, laboratories and bases.Anunnaki do not talk tête-à-tête with humans, nor convey their messages on apersonal basis. And most certainly, Anunnaki do not abduct humans. However,direct and personal contact did happen with aliens. They were the “Greys”.But this occurrence is extremely rare. Ulema Al Bakri said: “ And when and if ithappens, extraterrestrials would not pronounce one word and walk away, orstutter as some contactees reported”, including one famous contactee inSwitzerland who made headlines worldwide and became the messenger of the Lyranson earth. When aliens contact (So to speak) or encounter a human being, theyusually complete sentences and engage into a dialogue, even though, as it wasreported, the dialogue is short, and their words are incomprehensible, and thevoice is mechanic and fuzzy.In some instances, the aliens transmit their messages mentally, nottelepathically, because for the telepathic phenomenon to occur, you need twotelepathic people, and most certainly contactees who are regular folks areneither gifted nor trained telepaths. You cannot talk to another person on yourcellular phone, if the other party does not have one. Do you want to try? Samething applies to telepathy; it needs two telepathic stations, fully operationaland fully capable of sending and receiving messages. The human brain did not yetreach this level.Although some preliminary forms of telepathy between humans were noticed in rareinstances. Extraterrestrials are capable of speaking and understanding manylanguages, including our own.They assimilate and “compute” words, sentences and physical expressions withmathematical formulas and numerical values. Some extraterrestrials have limitedvocal chords capabilities, but they can very quickly acquire additional vocalfaculties, and earth dialects by rewinding sounds and vibes.Contrary to what many contactees and others claim or depict, extraterrestrialsfrom higher dimensions/spheres do not talk like computerized machines. They havetheir own language but also they can absorb and assimilate all the languages onearth in a blink of an eye via the reception and emission of a spatial memory.*** *** *** Longevity of Quasi-Human-Life Form“ Izra-nafar-mikla’ch” I. Definition:“Izra-nafar-mikla’ch” is a term referring to the longevity of quasi-human-lifeform, such as Golem and hybrids.

The hybrid-human (Intraterrestrial) race is very different fromhybrid extraterrestrial race living on other planets. The hybrid-humans lookexactly like human beings, but are much shorter, and have different facialstructure. II. Description of the hybrids’ habitat:These hybrid children live in two different ways.> • a - Human environment:The first is the human environment. This happens when a hybrid child had beenadopted by a human family, usually, by a high ranking United States military manworking with aliens in secret military underground bases. This top echelonmilitary man adopts a hybrid child and raises him or her as a human being. Thishappens much more often than most people imagine.> • b - Underground/underwater communities:The second kind of habitat is a large communal living in underground and/ orunderwater dormitories, or sometimes in above ground level dormitories, butalways on Earth. III. Characteristics:Bedrooms, beds, toys, dining rooms, food, and eating habits.> • 1. While the adult hybrid usually has his or her own room, the children live> together.> • 2.

Hybrid children habitat as described by an Anunnaki:The following is an actual depiction of their habitat according to Sinhar AmbarAnati, the Phoenician-American hybrid woman, known to us as Victoria. She ismarried to SinharMarduck, an Anunnaki leader.I have reproduced the article from the original version of the book “Revelationof an Anunnaki’s Wife”, and which reappeared in an updated edition under thetitle “Anunnaki Ultimatum”, a book, authored by Maximillien de Lafayette withhis colleague, Dr. Ilil Arbell. Victoria (Ambar Anati) is conversing with hermother-in-law, Sinharinannaschamra who is the mother of SinharMarduck. Here isthe text (Title; Visiting the Hybrids) : a. Inside the base:Sinharinannaschamra said: “The base we are going to visit is an underwaterhabitat. We are about to descend way down into the Pacific.”“What about air?” Iasked, a bit apprehensive about the idea. Surely she won’t forget I could notbreathe under water, but still…“We pass through a lock that is safe for waterand air,” said Sinharinannaschamra, “and inside, it’s geared for the hybrids,which, just like humans, need air.” In a few minutes, we stopped and I assumed,correctly, that we were already inside the base. “They are expecting us,” shesaid. “Don’t worry about them. They know I can blow the whole place up if theydare to give me any trouble.”The spaceship’s door opened and I saw that we were inside a huge, hangar-likeroom. If I had expected a beautiful, aquarium-like window, showing the denizensof the deep playing in their blue environment, I would have been disappointed.But knowing the Grays, I expected nothing of the sort, and so the beige and grayroom, all metal and lacking any windows, did not exactly surprise me.“This base is enormous,” said Sinharinannaschamra. “It is used for manyoperations, but we will just concentrate on the hybrids today.” I was pleased tohear that, since I was secretly apprehensive about the possibility of stumblingon one of the Grays’ hellish laboratories. I will never forget, or forgive, whatI saw in their lab. But I said nothing and waited to see what was to happennext. Sinharinannaschamra walked me to a solid wall, put her hand on it, andwall shimmered a little and then moved, allowing a door to form and open for us. b. The refectory:We entered a long corridor, illuminated by stark, white light, with many regulardoors on each side. Sinharinannaschamra opened one of the doors and we entered alarge room, obviously a refectory since it contained extremely long tables, allmade of metal. The room was painted entirely in beige – tables, chairs, walls,and ceiling, and had no windows.It was scrupulously clean. Suddenly, the tables opened up, each table revealinga deep groove on each of its long sides. Plates of what seemed to be normalhuman food were released from the grooves, and placed each before a chair. Atthis moment, a few doors opened at various parts of the room, and from each dooran orderly file of children came in and settled at the table. They werecompletely silent, not a word was heard, as they picked up their forks and beganto eat. None of them paid any attention to us, even though we stood at plainview. The children seemed to range from six to twelve, but it was difficult tobe sure of that. On one hand, they were small and fragile, so I might havemistaken their ages. On the other hand, their eyes gave the impression of almostold age. They seemed wise beyond their tender years. Their hair was thin, theirskin was pale to gray, and they all wore white clothes of extreme cleanliness. c. Hybrids’ three distinct groups/categories:Despite these similarities, which made them look as if they were all related toeach other, I could tell some differences between them that seemed ratherfundamental. It was almost as if they fitted within three distinct groups. Imentioned it, in a whisper, to Sinharinannaschamra, and she nodded. “Yes, yougot it,” she said. “They consist of early-stage hybrids, middle-stage hybrids,and late-stage hybrids. > > • 1 - The first group is born from the first combination of abductees’ and> Grays’ DNA. They closely resemble the Grays. Look at their skin – the grayish> color is very close to that of the Grays, and so is the facial structure.> > • 2 - The second group, the middle-stage hybrids, are the result of mating> between these early-stage ones, once they are old enough for reproduction, and> human abductees. The resulting DNA is closer to humans, and so they look much> more like humans, and many of them lose the Progeria gene.> > • 3 - The third group, the late-stage hybrid, is the most important.> Middle-stage hybrids are mated with humans to create them – and they can> hardly be distinguished from humans.” “Yes, I can tell who the late-stagers> are quite easily,” I said. d. Hybrids placed for adoption:“But there are not too many of them here, right?” “This is true, not too manyare here. A large number of these hybrids, who represent the most successfulresults of the experiments, are placed for adoption with human families.”“Are the human families aware of the origin of their children?”“Yes, in most cases they are. Generally, they are adopted by a high-rankingUnited States military man or woman, who had worked, or still works, withaliens, in secret military bases. This happens much more often than most peoplesuspect… the spouse of the military person may or may not know, depending oncircumstances and character traits. These lucky hybrids lead a much better lifethan whose who are raised in places like this one, communally.”“Are they badly treated here? Are they abused by the Grays?”“No, the Grays don’t want to lose them, they are too valuable. But they receiveno love, no individual attention, there is no real parenting, and theenvironment is barren and depressing.They live like that until they are old enough to be of use in the experiments.Not a very nice life for any child.”“And what about Progeria? I mean, for the adopted ones.”“Only the hybrids who are entirely free of Progeria are adopted by humanfamilies. We even suspect, though we are not sure, that many of the Progeriastricken late-stagers are killed, since their Progeria gene is too strong. TheGrays believe that after these three attempts, it cannot be eradicated byfurther breeding.”“And so they kill the poor things… what is the motive for all these atrocities?”“All for the same reason I have mentioned. They think they somehow will savetheir civilization. But they are doomed.”“But in the meantime, they harm, torture, and kill so many people. I don’tunderstand why it is tolerated.”Sinharinannaschamra did not answer. e. Disposing of the food and cleaning the refectory:The children finished eating, still in complete silence. Each child, as he orshe finished his meal, leaned back into the chair, and as soon as all of themwere leaning back, the groove from which the plates came opened up, andre-absorbed all the plates.“They now go to an automatic dishwashing machine,” explainedSinharinannaschamra. The children got up, and left the dismal room in the samefile arrangement they came in. As soon as the room was empty, large vacuumcleaners emerged from the wall and sucked up every crumb, every piece of debris.Then they sprayed the tables and floor with a liquid that smelled like adisinfectant. The room was spotlessly clean again, ready for the next sad,depressing meal. f. Dormitories and sleeping quarters:“Shall we go to the dormitories now?”Asked Sinharinannaschamra. I nodded.We followed the children through one of the doors, and entered a place that wasa combination of an old-fashioned orphanage and military barracks. It was a verylarge room, but the ceiling was not high, only about twelve feet. Again,everything was beige and gray, and there were no windows to relieve themonotony. The room was full of beds, arranged above each other in groups ofthree, like in a submarine. Dozens and dozens of such rows seemed to stretch to a very long distance. Thebeds were made of some metal, very smooth, and of silver-gray color. They seemedto be assembled like prefab furniture. “Sinharinannaschamra,” I said, “there areno ladders. How do the children reach the upper levels?”“They can levitate,” said Sinharinannaschamra.“Look at this. Part of each bed is magnetic, so each child can have his or hertoys attach to it. As for the lower beds, the toys are stored next to them.”“So they have toys,” I said.“That’s a mercy.”“Yes, the Grays discovered that mental stimulation is highly important to thehybrids’ development. There are plenty of other activities, mostly withabductees, that relieve their lives of the tedium, at least to a certainextent.”“But they have no privacy at all.”“None whatsoever, they only get their own room when they are more mature, butthey have one thing that pleases them. If the children want to, they can puttheir things in their bed, close the bed with a panel, and hide it inside awall. They like that.”“I wonder, too, if it is not a comfort for them to be together, after all.”“Their feelings and emotional climate are not exactly human…it’s hard toexplain.I think it’s time for you to see them interact.”“Where are all the children now?” “They are attending various activities,” saidSinharinannaschamra.“Come, I’ll show you.” g. Attending various activities:We entered a room that opened directly from the dormitory. To my surprise, itwas really a glass bubble.You could see the outside, which was an unpleasant desert surrounding. I foundit nasty, but I figured that to the children it might have represented apleasant change. About ten children, seemingly between the ages of six andeight, sat on the ground, which was simply the desert sand. They were playingwith normal human toys – trucks, cars, and trains. They filled the things withsand, using plastic trowels that one usually sees on the beach. They were alsobuilding tunnels from the sand, wetting it with water from large containers thatstood here and there. They seemed to be enjoying their games, certainlyconcentrating on them, but their demeanor remained quiet and subdued, and theydid not engage in the laughter, screaming, yelling, or fighting that children ofthis age usually produce.“They also have rooms with climbing equipment, and places to play ball,” saidSinharinannaschamra.“It is needed to strengthen their bones and muscles,” she added.I approached the children, a little apprehensively, worrying that I mightfrighten the poor things. They looked up at me, seemingly waiting for me to dosomething, but I was pleased to realize that they were not afraid. I sat on thesand, took some stones that were scattered around, and arranged them so thatthey created a little road. The children stared at me for a minute with theirstrange, wise eyes, as if trying to read my thoughts, and almost instantlygrasped the idea and continued to build the road together. None of them smiled,but they seemed very much engaged in the new activity. Once all the stones wereused, they looked at me again, as if trying to absorb information, and sureenough, after a minute they took the trucks and make them travel on the littleroad. I got up and let them play.“So they read minds,” I said to Sinharinannaschamra.“To an extent,” she said. “At this age, they basically just absorb images youproject. You probably thought about the trucks going on this road, and they sawit…” and she added. “And everything was done together, as if they were mentallyconnected,”I asked: “Do they do everything together?”“Yes, everything is communal, even the bathrooms where they clean themselves.But don’t be too upset about it. If they are separated from each other beforetheir adolescence, they are extremely upset. It is almost as if the onset ofpuberty makes them an individual, and before that they have a group mentality.”“Horrible,” I said.“They are not unhappy,” said Sinharinannaschamra.“Only as adolescents, when they break off the communal mind, they understand howunhappy they are. But we will visit the adolescents on another occasion.”“Very well,” I said. h. The fetuses’ room:Sinharinannaschamra asked: “Would you like to see the room where they keep thefetuses?” I followed her to the corridor, and we walked quite a distance beforeopening another door. We entered another one of the hangar-sized rooms, full oftanks. “Each tank contains colored and different liquid nutrients,” saidSinharinannaschamra. “This is where they put the fetuses, as soon as they areremoved from the abductees. The tanks are arranged in order, from the youngestfetuses to those that are almost ready to be removed.”“Do they separate them into their stages?” I asked.“Yes, this room is for early stagers only. In other rooms, they have the middlestagers. But the late stagers remain in the mother’s womb until birth, to makethem as close to humans as possible.”“And what are the babies like?”“Quiet, not as responsive as human babies. Many of them die as soon as they areremoved from the tank. Those that survive are generally mentally well developed,physically weak, and emotionally subdued.”“And who takes care of them?”“Both the Grays and the abductees. The Grays perform most of the physicalrequirements, but the abductees supply the human touch. We can’t go there yet.”“How come?”“We need to prepare you to interact with abductees. They are very complicated.We shall have a few sessions about interacting with them at the same time weteach you how to work with the adolescents.Also, you wanted some instructions of how to contact and help those people thatare children of humans and Anunnaki, like your son. This should take someteaching, too.” We went back to our spaceship, not saying much. I rememberthinking that if I were part of the Anunnaki Council, I would vote to kill everyGray in the known universe.Of course I did not say it to Sinharinannaschamra, but I am sure she knew how Ifelt. Back home, I went to my beloved garden and sat under a tree thatconstantly showered tiny blossoms on me, like little snowflakes. I did not evenknow I was crying.“What is the matter?” said Marduchk, who suddenly appeared next to me. I toldhim about the visit with the hybrids.“The hybrids are not abused,” said Marduchk.“Something else is bothering you.” I thought for a moment, and then decided Imight as well be honest with him. “Yes,” I said.“I cannot understand the Anunnaki’s casual attitude about the fact thatthousands of human beings are tortured and killed all the time. Neither you norSinharinannaschamra seem to be as shocked as I am about the fact that the Graysengage in such atrocities.”Marduchk was quiet for a minute, thinking. At this conversation, we did not usethe Conduit, because at my agitated state I found it difficult. I was notentirely used to it as yet. So I waited for him to say what he thought. “I seeyour point,” he said. “You think we are callous about it.”“Yes, I do, to tell you the truth. Why don’t you destroy the Grays? Why do youallow so much death, so much pain? Are you, after all, cruel beings? Have youbecome callous because you have lived so many years, and became thick-skinnedabout suffering?”“No, we are not cruel.It’s just that we view life and death differently than you do. We cannot destroyall the Grays, even if we wanted to. We don’t commit genocide, even if they tryto do it. But we don’t want to kill them. We know that they will die on theirown.”“And in the meantime, suffering means nothing to you?”“It means a lot, but destroying the Grays would not eliminate suffering in allthe universes we go to.There are other species that are even worse, you just don’t know them becausethe objects of their behavior are not humans.”“It seems to me, that even though you are so much more sophisticated than thehumans, the fact that you deny the existence of God may have deprived you ofyour ethics, after all.”“Deny God? What makes you think we deny God?” asked Marduchk. He seemedgenuinely surprised.“Marduchk, you have told me, more than once, that the Anunnaki created the humanrace, not God. So where is God if He is not the Creator? Your statements arecontradictory.” *** *** *** [Image00004.gif] PART 8 The Ramadosh Supernatural andMetaphysical TechniquesThe Supersymetric MindActivation of the Conduit Godabaari “Gudi-Ha-abri” Technique Godabaari is a term for an Ulema’s technique/practice aimed at developing afaculty capable of making objects move at distance, by using vibes emanated bythe “Conduit” implanted in the brain. It is composed of three words: a -Goda or Gudi, which means great; influential; powerful,b -Ha, which means first; the first vibration,c -Abaari or Abri, which means to cross over or to displace. I-Developing the Conduit: There are techniques which are partially physical and partially mental. Youcould refer to them as psychosomatic. As a beginner, even though your Conduit isnow open, you cannot tap directly into it, because consciously, you don’t evenknow where it is located in your brain. By adopting some postures and positions,you will send sensations to your brain.These positions will create internal muscular vibrations, and your mind willread them. You will be sending mental visionary lines, and these will activatethe cell which is responsible for imagination. By the power of concentration andintrospection, you will start to get intensified activity in the brain. Thiscauses a buzz vibration in the brain the Conduit begins to detect.Then, the Conduit will absorb the vibrations and organize them, and from thatmoment on, the Conduit will take over.To summarize, by attempting certain activities, you are sending a message toyour Conduit. It will take some time, because at the beginning, your Conduit maynot catch the messages, or if it does catch them, may not interpret the messagescorrectly, because the Conduit is not one hundred percent awake.With practice, the Conduit becomes familiar with these types of messages, and itbegins to give them codes. Each activity would have its own code.One thing must be understood. You cannot do these techniques to amuse yourself,since they simply will not work unless there is a purpose to the activity, andit must be a beneficial, positive purpose. II. Moving objects by using mental powers: As mentioned earlier, you cannot do any of these techniques to amuse yourself,it simply will not work unless there is a purpose to the activity, and it mustbe a beneficial and positive purpose. It does not have to be a greatundertaking, a simple positive intent will be just fine. Put a lightweightcoaster on the table. You wish to manipulate it with the beneficial intent ofpreventing a cup of coffee or tea from spilling on the table. Before starting,sit in a comfortable position next to the table.Never attempt to do this technique standing up – you may very easily lose yourbalance and fall. You should not try to start with a heavy object, but once youlearned how to work with this technique, and your powers become stronger, youcould increase the weight of the objects. III. Preparations: In preparation, certain changes in lifestyle are needed during two weeks beforeyou start your exercises:> • 1- Avoid all alcoholic beverages.> • 2- Avoid smoking, or tobacco in any form> • 3- Abstain from sexual activity.> • 4- Do not eat meat.> • 5- Do not use any animal fat, such as lard, bacon drippings, or butter, in> your cooking. IV. Precautions during practice: During your practice, certain precautions must be taken:> • 1- Take off your shoes, and make sure your feet touch the ground, to anchor> yourself> • 2- Do not wear anything made of metal.> • 3- Do not allow either people or pets in the same room with you. You must> have complete privacy.> • 4- Do not have any crystal glass in the room with you. V. The technique: > • 1- Extend your hands in front of you from the elbow up and shake them in the> air for four or five seconds. This cleanses the hands from superfluous energy> that might have accumulated on them.> • 2- With your arms in the same position, spread your fingers and hold for> three seconds.> • 3- Put your thumbs right on the temples, with the fingers still spread in> front of your face.> Make sure the thumbs are located in the small indentation that is close to> your eyes. People who practice acupressure will recognize this spot – pressing> it is used to cure headaches. Hold the position for three seconds.> • 4- Rotate your thumbs, taking your fingers to the back of your head, and put> your forefingers in the indentation at the back of your head, where it meets> the neck. Again, people who practice acupressure will recognize this spot; it> is used to cure headaches.> • 5- Push your forefingers into the indentation, and hold the position for ten> seconds.> • 6- Close your eyes.> • 7- While still sitting with your back straight, bring your chin as close to> your solar plexus as possible. Remain in this position for ten seconds. At> this point, you will feel a slight dizziness. This is perfectly fine; it is> part of the procedure.> • 8- Keeping your thumbs in their position, release the forefingers, and> rotate your hands forward until you can put your forefingers in the small> indentations by the sides of the bridge of your nose. In acupressure, this is> the site for one of the techniques that release pressure in the sinuses, so> practitioners would be able to recognize the sensation.> • 9- The rest of your fingers should be kept in a horizontal position, the> fingers of one hand resting over the fingers of the other hand, the thumbs> pointing down.> • 10 - Move your thumbs toward each other and have them touch. Your hands will> form a triangle. Your arms will be in a position of ninety degrees, relative> to your body.> • 11 - Say to yourself, mentally, I will now make the coaster move.> • 12 - In your mind, draw one line from the middle of your left wrist, and> another line from the middle of your right wrist, toward the coaster.> Visualize the coaster between the two lines.> • 13 - Keeping your hands in the same position, raise your head and sit> straight.> • 14 - Drop your hands down slowly. In your mind’s eye, keep on visualizing> the coaster.> • 15 - Bring your arms close to your body so the arms touch the ribs.> • 16 - Move your hands up to a position in which they are horizontal to the> floor.> • 17 - The left hand should serve as a rod, moving the left line further to> the left. The same should be done with the right hand, moving the line further> to the right.> • 18 - Keep concentrating on the coaster, with your eyes still closed, for at> least another minute.> • 19 - With your eyes still closed, you will notice blue lines and bubbles> moving in front of your eyes.> • 20 - At this point, decide which side of your body you are about to employ.> You may use either side, but not both at the same time.> • 21 - Let’s assume you chose the left side. Open your eyes, and concentrating> on the left line, look intently at the coaster. Move your left hand a little> to the side, and the coaster will move with it. You have accomplished your> mission. VI. Closing the energy: This is the end of the exercise, but like any other mental technique, you cannotjust leave and go about your business. You have created a center of energy,which should never be left open. The energy you have created with this exerciseis linear.To create an all-around center of energy needs a higher training, and closing itis more difficult, but closing the linear energy is relatively easy.> • 1- Extend both hands, straight in front of you.> • 2- Make the hands stay in the direction of the lines.> • 3- Bring the hands close together, with a very little distance between them.> • 4- Visualize a very thin thread entering the space between the hands. Close> your hands around the thread.> • 5- Bring your closed hands toward your solar plexus.> • 6- Open your hands, and shake them as you have done in the beginning. You> have closed the center of energy. *** *** *** Gomari “Gumaridu” Technique Gomari is a term referring to an Anunnaki Ulema technique capable ofmanipulating time.It is also called the “Net Technique”. Ulema Rabbi Mordechai said: “Human beingstreat time as if it were linear. Day follows day, year follows year, and taskfollows task. The Anunnaki Ulema, however, have long ago learned how to treattime nonlinearly, and thus be able to accomplish more in their lives.” I. The Exercise: For the purpose of this exercise, one must have complete privacy, and inaddition, one’s consciousness changes under the influence of the exercise tosuch an extent that a mother, for instance, would not hear her children if theyneed her. So the exercise cannot be done while young children are at home. Also,if you are taking care of an ill or elderly relative, you should not pursue iteither. If parts of the tasks you wish to accomplish are to be done at work,again, you cannot accomplish that because almost all jobs involve the presenceof other people. Therefore, for the purpose of this exercise, we will choose asimple frame and an acceptable set of tasks. Let’s choose a Saturday, and youhave to accomplish a few tasks. All of them must be done on Saturday, because onSunday you are expecting to be busy with other things. You have, in short, sevenhours. Let’s assume you have chosen these tasks:> • You have to drive your spouse to the airport.> • You have committed yourself to your boss, promising that you will write a> report of a hundred pages or so for Monday.> • You want to shop for food for the week.This is quite a lot to do in the seven hours that we will assume are availableto you during that day. The trip to the airport would take about an hour. Theshopping will take about an hour and a half. As for the report, it looks like itshould take at least ten hours. So obviously some of the things you wanted to dowill not get done. But the Anunnaki-Ulema say that all these things can be doneif you learn to break the “mold of the linear time”, and they have a techniqueone can learn to do so. II. The Equipment: > For this technique, you will need a few props:> • A round net. It can be anything – a fishing net, a crochet tablecloth,> anything made of thread or yarn with perforations. It should be around four> feet in diameter.> • Paper> • Pencil> • Scissors. III. The Technique: > • 1- Since one of the tasks involves taking your spouse to the airport, work> on the preliminary preparations behind a closed door.> • 2- Look intently at the net, and memorize the way it looks, so that you can> easily visualize it.> • 3- Close your eyes and visualize the net.> • 4- In your mind, draw a large circle on the net.> • 5- In your mind, let the net float in the air, making sure it is not flat> and horizontal, but moving, bending, waving, and being in a vertical position> most of the time.> • 6- In your mind, concentrate on the tasks you wish to accomplish.> • 7- In your mind, represent each task as a hole that you mentally perforate> in the net. Since you have three tasks, you visualize three holes.> • 8- Open your eyes, take the physical net, and toss it lightly on a chair or> a couch nearby. Do not make it flat and horizontal, just let it land on the> piece of furniture like a casual throw.> • 9- Close your eyes again, and visualize the holes in the mental net. Look at> the holes you made, visualizing their shape, their edges, and their exact> position on the mental net.> • 10- In your mind, throw the mental net on the physical net.> • 11- Take the paper and pencil, and draw three circles that would match, by> their shape and size, the mental holes you have visualized.> • 12- Cut the circles with the scissors.> • 13- Write the descriptions of the tasks you wish to perform on the back of> the paper, a single task for each circle. If possible, break the task into> segments. For example, if you are working on the circle that represents the> trip to the airport, write:> • a -Take car out of the garage – five minutes.> • b -Drive to airport and drop spouse at the terminal – twenty five minutes.> • c -Return home – twenty five minutes.> • d -Return car to the garage – five minutes. Do the same for all the tasks.> • 14- Put the circles on the physical net and fold it around them. Tie the top> with a ribbon, so the papers will not fall out, and suspend it on a hook or a> door.> It must remain suspended until the tasks are done, or until the seven hours> are over.> • 15- Start with a linear task, which will anchor you. The best one will be> the trip to the airport, and for this task no Anunnaki-Ulema powers are used> at all. Even though your Conduit is not open, since you have not been trained> by a master, it is still there and it can calculate what it needs to do, and> how to partially and gradually squeeze the other tasks into the frame of seven> hours.> • 16- When you come back home, you should start the second task, the shopping.> While you are shopping, the Conduit will employ a system that will be like two> old-fashioned tape recorders working at the same time.> One tape recorder is working slowly, about 30 turns per second.> The other tape recorder does 1000 turns a second. They do not interfere with> each other.> While you are shopping, which is represented by the slow tape recorder, the> time you are using is slower than the time t he Conduit is squeezing in.> The Conduit knows how quickly to “spin” because you have outlined the tasks> and the time they take on the circles of paper. This is, therefore, the way> the faster tape recorder works.> • 17- When you come back from your shopping trip, you decide to go to your> computer to work on your report. You have to make sure all the physical parts> are working properly: The computer is connected to the printer, the paper in> the printer is sufficient for printing the entire report, your ink cartridge> is fresh, and everything on your desk is in order.> • 18- Before you start working on your report, unplug the telephone, turn off> the TV, make sure nothing is on the stove, and your room’s door is locked.> • 19- Start typing the report.> • 20- What will happen now will not be entirely clear and understandable to> you, because you will be existing, for the duration, on different levels of> vibrations.> • 21- Everything will seem, and actually be, faster than you are accustomed> to, including your typing speed.> • 22- Your body will function normally, but you will not be entirely aware of> it, and you will lose your awareness of your physical surrounding.> • 23- After working for a while, you will feel extremely tired, and without> much thinking you will lie down and fall asleep. This is important, because at> this time, it is not your normal physical faculties that are in control, but> copies of yourself, your doubles, are handling the job. Unless you are a> master, it is best to sleep during such occurrences.> • 24- After a while, and the time for that varies greatly, you will wake up.> Naturally, you will return to the computer, feeling again like yourself, and> ready to resume your typing.> • 25- You may be stunned to see that the report of a hundred pages, which you> expected to spend hours upon hours preparing, will be neatly stacked by your> printer, completely done.> • 26- When you read it, it will be perfectly clear that it was written by> yourself, entirely your work and your style, including your regular mistakes> and typos, since the doubles do not edit your work.> • 27- The only difference is that it was done with supernatural speed.> • 28- This is a proof positive that you have done the work personally and did> not hallucinate these occurrences. > IV. Closing the Energy Center:> > You have created a strong field of energy, which now must be closed.> • 1- Take the net you have suspended, and open it up.> • 2- Take out the paper circles, and cross-out the tasks that have been> accomplished.> • 3- Fold the net and put it in its regular place.> • 4- Throw out the circles.> • 5- You have closed the energy center. Tour tasks are done.*** *** *** Gomatirach-Minzari> “ Gomu-Minzaar” Technique> Known also as the “Mirror to Alternate Realities”.Ulema Mordechai ben Zvi said: “Building and using the Minzar is risky. However,if the student reads the instructions carefully and does not deviate from them,it should be a reasonably safe procedure. If you choose to try it, this may beone of the most important lessons you will ever learn, since the benefits, bothphysical and spiritual, are without equal.Those who are familiar with the concept of the Anunnaki’s Miraya would notice aresemblance in the way these tools are used. However, one should realize that weare not pretending to use the kind of cosmic monitor that is connected, throughthe Akashic Libraries on Nibiru, to the Akashic Record itself. It is beyond ourscope to even conceive how such a tool had ever been created. Nor are weattempting to recreate the kind of Minzar that is used by the Anunnaki-Ulema,who are enlightened beings whose Conduit has been opened.Most of us possess a Conduit that has not been opened, and the Minzar werecommend is fitted to our level of advancement. Nevertheless, working with theMinzar will open doors that will astound and amaze any student. You will beusing the techniques to create an alternate reality that will allow you to dothings you have never imagined are possible. CREATING YOUR OWN WORLD What you are aiming for is a place to which you can retreat at will, a placewhere you can have many options. It will be a place of beauty and comfort, andit should allow you opportunities to learn, to create, to invent, to meetcompatible people, to connect with animals, to heal, or to simply take avacation.The place is designed and planned entirely by you, and is brand new. You cannotsay “My new alternate reality is exactly like Rome, Italy,” because there is agood possibility that the Conduit, confused by this mixed message, will actuallytake you to Rome, Italy, in our own world.If this happens, no real harm is done, but no benefit will occur either. Youwill simply be wandering the streets of another city, not benefiting from theadvantages of an alternate reality at all. However, you should certainly takecertain elements from places you like, Rome included if that is what you wish,since you are not required to build your new reality in a vacuum.However, don’t limit yourself to one place. You may want to copy a particularart museum from Rome, where you can always indulge in looking at your favoritesculptures and paintings. Then, you might want to add the gorgeous rose gardenfrom the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens in New York City.A charming old-world train station from somewhere in Eastern Europe might makethe place more interesting, with perhaps a touch of the Orient Express, and asunny Mediterranean beach would not hurt, either.How about a café you liked in Paris, and the cozy little library from your hometown, where you used to have so much fun during your childhood and you knew youcould find every book that was ever written?Design the house you would want to live in. It may be an opulent mansion, or onthe other hand, some of us would prefer a small, simple, rural-type house with arestful cottage garden.It’s all entirely up to you.Create your new world carefully and don’t worry if you change things around asyou go along, there is always room for change and development. Did you suddenlyremember your trip to China and a wonderful Pagoda you liked? Put it in. Did youenjoy your snorkeling in Australia? Add a barrier reef. One thing should be madeentirely clear. Any place you want is allowed, except a place where others arehurt in any way whatsoever, and that includes not only humans, but animals aswell. Do not imagine a steak dinner, do not imagine fishing, do not imaginehunting.Don’t waste your time imagining the “glories” of wars. Do not imagine a placewhere you demean your spouse and yourself by having multiple partners. Do notimagine pornography. Do not imagine a place where you revenge the ills broughton you by people you hate. Your Conduit will not accept any action that cancause pain or even discomfort to any living creatures. Therefore, if you haveany negative intention, you are wasting your time. You can build twentyMinzaars, but none of them will take you to such a place. Rather, if you wish toheal from hurts imposed by others, or painful addictions, imagine yourselfgetting away from all and entering a fresh new world where nothing of this sortexists. Rest assured that you will never meet anyone who had ever hurt you inyour new reality. Do this for a few weeks before you build the Minzaar, so thenew place is well established in your mind and you can imagine it in seconds.This is essential because contacting the new reality during the building of theMinzaar requires speed, and no one can create a new world for themselves in afew minutes! And most important, don’t do it as a chore.This should be a fun, rewarding mental exercise. There is no doubt that you willmeet pleasant people in your new reality, but there are those who would alsowish to have a guide, or a friend, to introduce them to the new world.This is also possible, and the directions are given below.If this is part of your plan, by all means do the same and imagine the personyou wish to contact with. Don’t limit yourself to the kind of person you thinkyou should choose. The friend does not have to be a conventional “spiritualguide” which is often described by people who channel entities, such as a NativeAmerican guide, an Asian guru, or a guardian angel. The guide can be just aboutanyone you would like to have as a friend. I. Prerequisites: > • For seventy-two hours before building the Minzaar, and before any subsequent> visit to the alternate reality, you must abstain from:> • Drinking alcohol> • Using any addictive substance> • Eating meat.> • Wearing nail polish> • Do not wear clothes made of polyester.> • Wear white or light colored clothes.> • Imagine only positive conditions (see above for details). II. Precautions: > • Before starting, remember the full instructions carefully.> • These procedures are for novices, and involve mental transportation only.> • If, however, you become extremely adept, there is a possibility of future> physical teleportation. In such event, please exercise some logical> restrictions on your activities.> • For example, people who had heart problems, pregnant women, and individuals> with severe arthritis, asthma, diabetes, should not take the chance of moving> physically between realities without consulting first with an Enlightened> Master who would advise them on the best way to proceed.> • The Minzaar, during building or using, may explode. The explosion is small,> and the glass that is used does not shatter or fly around, so you will not be> hurt by it.> • However, if it is built inside your home, or in any confined area, such an> occurrence may cause damage to children, pets, furniture, or decorative> objects.> • The Minzaar must be built in an outdoor location, where the energy that will> be released during such an explosion will not cause damage.> • You can build it in your back yard, but if you live in an apartment in the> city, you must find an appropriate location where you will be outside, but> still have some privacy.> • A woman should not wear loose skirts, flowing dresses, or scarves. For> everyone, close-fitting clothes, though not too tight for comfort, are highly> recommended.> • Never wear clothes made of polyester.> • Remove any jewelry or metal objects you may be wearing.> • You will be using dry ice. When you handle it, make sure to wear gloves,> since direct contact with dry ice will burn your skin.> • You will be using two bowls. Make sure they are not made of metal.> • When you cut the dry ice, be sure to place it in the dry bowl. Never mix dry> ice and water, this can cause serious injury. III. Equipment and Supplies: The supplies required to build the Minzaar are readily available. You will need:> • Laminated glass, two feet by two feet, with rounded, smooth edges. Laminated> glass is made of two layers of glass, and it does not shatter into sharp-edged> slivers when it breaks. It is the safest glass you can use. Have the store cut> it for you to the right dimensions.> • A few pieces of charcoal.> • A role of aluminum foil.> • A very small quantity of dry ice. You will only need a small cube,> approximately the size of a dice.> • Two very thin pieces of wire, each three feet in length.> • Two iron nails.> • A Magnet.> • Two plastic or glass bowls that would contain sixteen ounces of liquid each.> Never use metal.> • Lumber, enough to build a two feet by two feet base, two inches height.> • Wood glue.> • Adhesive spray.> • Fabric glue.> • Small finishing nails.> • A small hammer.> • Water.> • A sheet of white linen, large enough to create four panels that you will use> to surround yourself as you work with the Minzaar.> • This sheet should be made of flame-retardant fabric, or if you cannot find> such a sheet, spray your linen with flame-retardant spray.> • Four Pieces of cardboard, six feet by two feet. IV. Building the Minzaar:> > • Magnetize the iron nails by placing them next to the magnet for a few hours.> • Build a wooden base. It should be a simple box, two feet by two feet, and> two inches tall.> • Use the wood glue and the finishing nails to make it steady.> • Fold each piece of cardboard vertically, ending with a small pyramid> measuring three feet by two feet.> • Make all four can stand up steadily.> • With the fabric glue, attach four panels from the white linen sheet to the> cardboard pyramids.> • Rub the coal on one side of the glass, until it covers the surface with a> thin black film.> • Use the adhesive glue spray to stabilize the film. Allow to dry thoroughly.> • From the aluminum foil, cut seven ribbons.> • Each should be a little less than one inch in width.> • Six of the ribbons should be exactly two feet long, and the seventh should> be two inches longer.> • Take four ribbons, not including the longer one, and glue them to the coal> covered side of the glass.> • They should be placed with equal distance between them and from the edges,> creating five equal sized spaces where the coal dust will be visible.> • Take the remaining three ribbons.> • They should be glued on top of the four ribbons, but in ninety degrees to> them, creating a grid.> • The longer ribbon should be glued in the middle of the box, with an inch> extending on each side.> • The others should be glued with equal distance between the middle ribbon and> the edges, creating four spaces. The grid will thus be made of square spaces> between the ribbons.> • Use the extra ribbon that is extending from both sides to attach the wires.> Each wire will be extending vertically from the box.> • Place the glass on the wooden base, coal and ribbon side down, and clean> side up.> • Make sure the glass and the base are squared and the edges are perfectly> aligned.> • To each wire, attach one of the magnetized nails you have prepared in> advance.> • Arrange the panels around the box.> • There should be one on three sides, and the fourth one will be placed behind> you.> • Pour the water into one of the bowls, and place one of the nails into it.> The wire that is attached to this nail must be fully stretched.> • Cut the dry ice, wearing gloves, into a dice-sized cube. Place it in the> dry, empty bowl. Remember never to mix dry ice and water!> • That wire should be closer to the glass than the one that is touching the> water, so bend it slightly.> • The dry ice will produce some smoke. That is normal, it is an effect that is> often used for theatrical production, and it will not hurt you.> • Sit in front of the glass box, put the fourth panel behind you, and close> your eyes. V. Contacting the Alternate Realities: > • Close your eyes and visualize a green, virgin land, a place no one has ever> seen before.> • Imagine, dream, and think about the land you have been visualizing for the> past few weeks.> • You are bringing the things you love and want most, the good things that you> wish to see in your life, to the green land. You are creating a new earth, the> way you want it.> • There are people in the new place.> • You must build places for them, streets, houses, a wonderful city or> countryside, exactly the way you want it.> • Working as fast as you can, and with your eyes still closed, in a few> minutes you will sense smoke coming from your left side. It will not rise> high, but remain rather low, and it will creep close to the glass.> • Realize that even though your eyes are closed, you will actually see the> smoke.> • When you are sure you are seeing the smoke, open your eyes.> • Put both your hands on the glass, with your fingers spread out.> • Concentrate your gaze on the spaces between the fingers. Bring to mind all> the beautiful things you imagined in the new land, and place them in the> spaces between the fingers.> • Start alternating your concentration between the tips of your fingers and> the spaces between the fingers.> • Continue for about five minutes.> • You will notice that the tips of your fingers will produce light, in the> form of sparks. There will be no physical sensation caused by these sparks.> • Slide your hands closer to your body until they are about an inch or two> from your body.> • Put your hands on the edges of the glass, each on one side.> • Look down into the bottom of the Minzaar. You will notice that the color of> the aluminum ribbons has changed, and that the charcoal film looks as smooth> as a marble. The glass has turned into a black mirror, and a line of light> will vibrate on the black surface.> • You will begin to see the things you have imagined as miniatures in the> black mirror.> • Some will look proportional and organized. Others will be out of proportion.> They will be moving and shifting.> • You may have created a person to function as a friend and a guide.> • If you did so, look for that person in the Minzaar.> • You will soon find him or her, so try to increase the size of the person. In> a few seconds, the person will acquire dimension, proportion, and personality,> and will appear as real, in or out of the Minzaar.> • You will establish a true rapport with him or her, though you may not quite> understand the nature of the rapport.> • If what you imagined is a country, or a place, or a house rather than a> person, you will develop the connection to it so that you will be able to> escape to this place at will. Many students prefer creating such a place,> since, as it will most likely to have people in it, will combine the> advantages of both.> • In the future, you will not need to build a second Minzaar, or even use the> many steps of preparations to envision the person or the place you have> created.> • They will be stored in your brain. The act of building the Minzaar was meant> to trigger one of the Conduit faculties in the brain. A rudimentary one by> comparison to what the Anunnaki-Ulema can do, but of great benefit none the> less.> • You could not, for example, simply buy a ready-made black mirror, and work> with it.> • You must follow the step-by-step the creation of the Minzaar to achieve the> effect.> • It will be a good idea to throw out the unnecessary equipment, such as the> nails, the bowls, etc., but keep the Minzaar, which has turned into a> beautiful black mirror, as a stimulus for the activity.> • You can go into the new country anytime you wish. It is a physical place,> located in a different dimension, but just as real as this one.> • When you go there, you can spend months in that time frame, while here on> earth only a few minutes will pass. That is because the Conduit allows you to> duplicate yourself, to create a double, and time is different in other> dimensions.> • What you can do there is limitless. You can simply rest and enjoy a place> that will never hurt you, a vacation from the trials and tribulations in the> here and now. Or, perhaps, you wish to create something.> • Let’s say you want to write a screenplay, and can never find the time or the> leisure to do it here. Well, you can go to your special place for the duration> of the time you need for writing this screenplay, and come back to your> present existence after a few seconds of leaving it.> • The advantage will be that you have written the play and it is all there in> your memory, one hundred percent of it. All you will need is the short time> needed to type it. Or perhaps you are not well, and you would like to see the> doctors and the hospitals you have created at this new environment.> • It is quite likely that they may have a cure to at least some ailments – it> won’t hurt to try. Possibly you wanted to build a magnificent library,> containing an enormous number of books. By all means, this is a wonderful> experiment, with one added bonus.> • When you are at this library, make a note of certain titles and authors> which you have never heard of before. Then, when you are back home, ask a> librarian, or check the Internet, to see if such titles/authors exist.> • If they do, it would be a proof that you have not been hallucinating! Or> perhaps you would like to try a new career, see how it feels to become a> teacher, or a singer, or a trapeze artist. Why not try it? You are the best> judge on what you wish to accomplish!VI. Subsequent Visits to the Alternate Realities: After the initial visit to the alternate reality, you will no longer need to usethe Minzaar. As mentioned before, some students find it easier to look at theMinzaar for a while before attempting the visit, but it is not entirelynecessary.> • The best time to visit is your usual bed time. Before you go to sleep, just> lie down on your bed. Generally, it is best to lie on your right side, to> avoid pressure on the heart.> • Close your eyes.> • Think about the place you want to visit.> • Draw as clear a picture of it in your mind as you can.> • At this point, remember the way your hands were placed on the Minzaar, and> imagine yourself behind your fingers.> • Tell yourself the first activity you wish to perform during your visit.> • For seven to ten seconds, do not think at all. Make your mind completely> blank.> • Do not be startled – amazing things will begin to happen now. Images will> float before your eyes, you will hear sounds, or noises. This is called “The> buzzing of the mind.”> • At this moment, the preliminary rapport is established between the necessary> cell in your Conduit and your double in the alternate reality.> • The cell will zoom you there and your double will be your guide. In other> words, the cell acts as your vessel, and the double as the pilot.> • As soon as you arrive, the double will stop all activities and instantly> merge with you.> • Your visit has begun. VII. Benefits and Advantages: Beside the pleasure and learning experiences that you gain through your trips tothe alternate reality, there are several concrete advantages that will manifestthemselves very soon in your normal reality.> • You will be less tense or nervous.> • You will gradually lose any phobia that might have tormented you for many> years, perhaps all your life.> • Your physical health will improve.> • You will be able to work efficiently, since you will bring with you some> very important creations, plans, or thoughts from your alternate reality.> • Such products or services will be performed in much greater speed since they> have been “rehearsed” in the alternate reality.> • You can learn languages with surprising speed since you can actually learn> them first in the alternate reality, and the memory is retained. That applies> to other skills, such as computer skills, art, music, and many others.> • You will put every moment to good advantage.> • If you hate waiting in line, or sitting in the doctor’s office, or listening> to your boss droning on and on while of course you cannot put a stop to the> conversation, just hop to the new reality for a few minutes, and do something> fun or creative there. Of course, for these few moments you will be out of> touch with your earth body, but you will be recalled back quickly as soon as> needed. Obviously, using this quick “hop” you will never be bored again, ever.> • To complement this activity, it is advisable to always carry a notepad and a> pen in case you wish to quickly record an experience. VIII. Returning to Your Regular Reality on Earth: We must note that there is never any need for fear. Some people are concernedthat the body that they have left on earth when visiting their alternate realitymight be exposed to harm, perhaps even attacked.There is no reason for such fear. First of all, with the exception of the firsttime, when you originally build the Minzar, you will usually do it in theprivacy of your own bedroom, and alone.Second, no matter how long you will spend in your alternate reality, you willreturn to your body seconds after you left it in our reality here, since timeflows very differently in the alternate reality, and the Conduit knows how tohandle it. The only thing you should be concerned about is not to come back intothe body too quickly. If you panic suddenly and zoom into your body, you mayharm it by this speed. You are perfectly safe, so come back easily and slowly.The best procedure for a beginner is to spend the time and enjoy the stay in thealternate reality without worrying about coming back. The first few times wouldnot take long, since you are so new at it, anyway. After a while, your stayswill be extended. In both cases, after what seems to be minutes, hours, days, or months, since itreally does not matter how long you are there, suddenly you will remember thatyou left your body behind. For a few seconds, you are not sure which part of youis real, and it may create the sense of fear discussed above. Remember there isnothing to fear, your Conduit is in control, and it knows what it is doing. Sowhen this moment arrives, allow yourself to relax, and in seconds you will beaware that you are back in the presence of your normal earth body.Do not rush, and do not bunch yourself quickly into the body from either side.Instead, help your Conduit by hovering horizontally right above your body, andthen settling peacefully into it. Most likely that will be followed by a fewminutes sleep, after which you will wake up refreshed and in complete memory ofyour activities in the alternate reality.” *** *** ***Gubada-AriThe Triangle of Life Technique Gubada-Ari is a term referring to the Anunnaki-Ulema “Triangle of Life”, and howto apply the value of the “Triangle” shape to health, success, and peace ofmind. Most importantly, how to find the healthiest spots and luckiest areas onearth, including private places and countries, and take advantage of this. How this technique will enhance your life: With the help of the triangle, youwill able to find the perfect areas on earth where your health, success, andpeace of mind will be at their optimum. You can work it on a large scale andfind out the best countries to live in, or on a small scale, which would giveyou the best neighbourhoods in your own city or county. I. Synopsis of the Theory: > • There are lines of energy spinning around the world. In this exercise, we> will concentrate on the lines that are revealed by the use of the triangle.> The energy flows in currents, both negative and positive, mostly underground,> traversing the globe. Those who live above the positive lines, will have good> health, success, and peace of mind. Those who live above the negative lines,> will have bad health, lack of success, and will experience mind turmoil. The> meaning of life is based on the fact that life is, in itself, a triangle. One> corner of the triangle represents health. The second represents success. The> third represents peace of mind.> • You find meaning by placing the triangle you are about to draw on the world.> • The student might ask, where do I put the triangle? How do I choose the> original location? The answer is, you put the triangle wherever you are.> • The student might ask, what if I change locations? The answer is, this> technique is working within the dictates of the moment. Wherever you are, the> triangle follows. Change it as many times in life as you need. It always> works. II. Materials:> > • This lesson can be accomplished with two different props. And they are easy> to find.> • You can use a globe, or a flat map of the world. A globe (Earth Globe) gives> a more precise direction, but it is expensive and sometimes hard to get. The> student may instead use a flat map of the world. It is not as precise, but the> distortion is so slight that it does not signify, and it is cheaper and> readily available. If you are using a map, you will need lightweight paper> which is somewhat transparent, a pen, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. If you> are using a globe, you will need plastic wrap, the kind that is used to wrap> sandwiches or leftovers in the kitchen, since it will adhere easily to a> globe. You will also need a magic marker that can write on this material, a> ruler, and a pair of scissors. III. The Technique: > • The drawings below show how the double triangle, or the six-pointed star,> was created. To be most effective, an individual exercise should be used> separately for Health, Success, and Peace of Mind. As you copy the template> below, simply change the word on top for each exercise.Note: See illustrations on the following pages. “Triangle A” was drawn as an equilateral triangle. [Image00005.gif]"},{"pageContent":" “Triangle B” was drawn by extending the lines on top of triangle A, and thenclosing these lines and thus creating a second triangle of the same sizeexactly.

Should you have a health issue, or a desire to live in the more> healthy places, these are your choices The Anunnaki-Ulema Triangle is a complex concept. Perhaps, to better understandits essence, revisiting Ulema Mordechai, and listening to him explaining to hisstudent Germain Lumiere (My pseudonym as it appeared in a few books) is a must.Excerpt from his dialogue with Lumiere. Ulema Mordechai and Germain Lumiere Dialogue “We are going to apply the value of the triangle shape to real life and to theorganization we call the Pères du Triangle. I am not sure if you are aware ofit, but there are six Triangles on earth. Actually, they rule the earth.”Lumiere: “Are they political? Secret? Are they part of existing governments?” Iasked.“They are more important, far more so, than mere governments. Can you define forme what are the most important things in life?”“Life itself?” I said.“Yes, this is right within itself, but it does not answer the question.” I wasannoyed. Here we go again, I said to myself. I am arguing with an old JewishRabbi. They always go round and round, using semantics that get you nowhere.“How can I be right and wrong at the same time?” I asked.“Well, we will go about it in a different way,” said Rabbi Mordechai. “What isthe meaning of life on earth?”“Family? Friends?” I said, knowing full well that he will argue again, and I wasright.“Family and friends make our life meaningful, of course,” said Rabbi Mordechai,but they are not the meaning of life. The meaning of life is based on the factthat life is, in itself, a triangle. One corner of the triangle representshealth.The second represents success.The third represents peace of mind. Visualize it like that.” And he demonstratedby joining his two thumbs and his two forefingers, creating a triangle. “Youfind meaning by placing this triangle on the world.” He leaned his hands on thelarge globe. “But the all important thing is to find the right spot to put thetriangle on.”“I am not sure I follow,” I said, dubiously.“So let’s demonstrate it with some props,” said Rabbi Mordechai. He gave mepaper, pencil, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. “Now,” he said, “draw and cut amore or less equilateral triangle from this peace of paper.” I did, trying mybest to make an exact drawing, and cut it carefully.“Now,” he said, “put it anywhere on the globe.”I took the paper, and feeling like a fool tried to place the paper on the globe,knowing that it will fall off since I used no glue. Of course it fell, severaltimes, until Rabbi Mordechai smiled rather cynically, an expression I have neverseen on his face before. “Put it on again,” he said, giving the globe a piercinglook. I did, and the paper stuck to the globe. Another trick, I thought. I wastired of tricks.“Spin the globe,” he said. The triangle stuck and the globe was spinning.“As this is happening,” said Rabbi Mordechai, “realize that if the lines of thetriangle were somehow continued, they would represent lines of energy around theworld. Let’s concentrate on the lines that occur when you extend the Healthcorner at the top of the triangle. This energy flows in currents, both negativeand positive, mostly underground, traversing the globe.” This was beginning tomake sense to me.I span the globe again, the paper stuck, and I tried to imagine the continuedlines that would follow the entire world. I was beginning to see the pattern.“Those who live above the positive lines, will have good health. Those who liveabove the negative lines, will have bad health. But let’s elaborate a little.Look at the drawing I am about to make.”He drew a triangle, wrote Health on the top of it, and said, “This is TriangleA.” Then, he extended the lines. “Close these lines and thus create a secondtriangle of the same size exactly, which we call Triangle B. Everything insideTriangle B will have good health. Now, make a copy, of an exact size, ofTriangle A. Move it up and center it exactly on Triangle B. By doing this, youhave created a six pointed Star of David.”By now I realized we were not doing any tricks, but studying a most fascinatingand helpful technique. “How do we proceed?” I asked, poring over the drawing.“We will number the four small triangles created on the sides of the Star ofDavid 1, 2, 3, and 4. All countries located inside these four small trianglesare good for health. Should you have a health issue, or a desire to live in themore healthy places, these are your choices.”“So I imagine that you can do the same for Success and Peace of Mind, to findthe best of each quality?”“Correct,” said Rabbi Mordechai.“Ah, but there still one problem here. Where do I put the triangle? How do Ichoose the original location? “ I asked.Rabbi Mordechai laughed. “For once, son, I encourage you to consider yourselfthe center of the world. You put the triangle wherever you are.”“However, Rabbi Mordechai, another question remains. At this moment I am inBudapest. I put the triangle on the map of Hungary and learn of my bestlocations. But next week, or next month, I am going back to France. Then, shouldI put it on the map of France?”“Yes, of course,” said Rabbi Mordechai.“This technique is working within the dictates of the moment. Wherever you are,the triangle follows. And it always works.”“I am a little surprised to see the Star of David involved in Ulema teachings,”I said.“Not at all,” said Rabbi Mordechai. “You must realize that the Kabalists sharemany of the Ulema techniques. There is much more to it, as this is only one ofthe seven great secrets of the Star of David,” said Rabbi Mordechai. “TheKabalists have been using it to great advantage for centuries.”“But the Triangle is used by the Pères du Triangle, so it is a universalsymbol,” I said.“Good point. As you can imagine, the presence of the Star of David caused theusual Anti Semitic comments that the Jews are ruling the financial world. Butthis is sheer nonsense. The Pères du Triangle includes people from all religionsand nations, and they have very little affiliation to either. The Star of David,even though it signifies in Judaism and is placed on the flag of the state ofIsrael, is entirely universal and many scholars claim its origin is Anunnaki.”Indeed, so much of the Ulema knowledge comes from the Anunnaki, that it did notsurprise me.” *** *** ***Cadari-Rou’yaa Technique Cadari-Rou’yaa is the name or term for a secret technique developed by theAnunnaki- Ulema, centuries ago, that enabled them to read the thoughts,intentions, and feelings of others.It is composed of two words:a -Cadari, which means a grid; a plasma-screen.b -Rou’yaa, which means vision; perception. Cadari-Rou’yaa is also a method to diagnose health, and prevent health problemsfrom occurring in the present, and in the future, by reading and interpretingthe rays and radiations, a human body diffuses on a regular basis.In the West, it is called reading of the aura.The following is an excerpt from an Ulema’s Kira’at (Reading). It is herewithreproduced verbatim (Unedited), from a Kira’at, as it was given by anAnunnaki-Ulema in the Middle East, and told by Maximillien de Lafayette. Ulema Sadiq is talking to his students (Verbatim): The Technique: > • 1 -You are going to learn wonderful things today. But you have to remember> that you should stay calm, focused and relaxed all the time.> • 2 -You are going to succeed. But you should not give up too easy. Don’t get> frustrated and despair because it is not working right away. At the beginning,> everything needs additional effort, a great deal of patience, and a strong> belief in yourself.> • 3 -We are not asking you to have a blind faith. Leave faith to others. Use> your mind. Follow the procedures. Practice, practice, practice. And everything> is going to be just fine.> • 4 -I repeat again one more time. Don’t get frustrated and anxious if it is> not working right away. It is going to work, and your patience will pay off.> • 5 -Now, go to a quite place. We suggest your office if you are sure nobody> is going to interrupt your practice, or just your bedroom if you can be by> yourself, alone, quite and distant from noises.> • 6 -You have to practice alone. Always alone.> • 7 -Good. Take a piece of paper. A plain sheet of white paper with no lines.> Size: 7 centimeters by 6 centimeters.> • 8 -On the left side of the paper, draw a red circle. Size: 2 centimeters in> diameter.> • 9 -Next to the red circle, and at a distance of 1 centimeter, draw a small> black dot. Size: Half the size of a bean.> • 10 -Next to the black dot, and at 1 centimeter distance, draw a green> circle. Size: 2 centimeters in diameter.> • 11 -All should be aligned equally and straight on the same line. (Same> level)> • 12 -Now you have from left to right: A red circle, a black dot, and a green> circle, all on the same line.> • 13 -Make sure the sheet of paper is placed 25 centimeters in front of you.> • 14 -Close your eyes for 4 seconds.> • 15 -Open your eyes, and breathe slowly and deeply.> • 16 -Close your eyes one more time for 2 seconds.> • 17 -Open our eyes, and breathe one more time slowly and deeply.> • 18 -Now, look straight at the black dot for just 2 seconds.> • 19 -Close your eyes for 2 seconds.> • 20 -Open your eyes now, and look one more time at the black dot for 40> seconds or so.> • 21 -Now, tell your left eye to look at the red circle, and your right eye to> look at the green circle at the same time.> • 22 -I know, it is strange, and it seems confusing to you all. But don’t> worry.> • 23 -Try again.> • 24 -Keep on trying until you get it right.> • 25 -Now, something is going to happen. Pay attention.> • 26 -You will start to see both circles getting closer.> • 27 -It is not an optical illusion.> • 28 -On the contrary, it is an optical adjustment, because now, your eyes and> your mind are working together. Something you have not done before.> • 29 -Now, something very new and very unusual is going to happen.> • 30 -Keep looking at those circles.> • 31 -Do not loose concentration.> • 32 -Watch now what is going to happen.> • 33 -The blue circle on your left starts to look very different. It has> something around it. Something you did not see before.> • 34 -The blue circle has some sort of a lighter color ring around it. It> could be any color. It does not matter.> • 35 -Remember you are still looking at both circles at the same time.> • 36 -Don’t leave one circle to go to another circle.> • 37 -Now the green circle on your right starts to look very different. It has> something around it. Something you did not see before.> • 38 -The green circle has some sort of a lighter color ring around it. It> could be any color. It does not matter.> • 39 -Remember you are still looking at both circles at the same time.> • 40 -Don’t leave one circle to go to another circle.> • 41 -Keep looking at both circles for two minutes or so.> • 42 -Something is going to happen now. Pay attention.> • 43 -It would/could appear to you that the black dot is moving somehow.> • 44 -Don’t let this distract you.> • 45 -Anyway, it will go away in a few seconds.> • 46 -Something very important is going to happen now. Pay attention.> • 47 -The ring around the blue circle on your left is getting bigger and> denser.> • 48 -The ring around the green circle on your right is getting bigger and> denser.> • 49 -And you are still looking at both circles.> • 50 -You are doing absolutely great.> • 51 -Now, focus your attention on the blue circle on your left.> • 52 -Something very important is going to happen now. Pay attention.> • 53 -The longer you look at the blue circle, the stronger and brighter is the> ring around it.> • 54 -Now the ring around the blue circle is getting denser.> • 55 -In less than 2 seconds, the ring becomes much much brighter and starts> to radiate.> • 56 -Now move to the green circle on your right.> • 57 -Focus your attention on the green circle on your right.> • 58 -Something very important is going to happen now. Pay attention.> • 59 -The longer you look at the green circle, the stronger and brighter is> the ring around it.> • 60 -Now the ring around the blue circle is getting denser.> • 61 -In less than 2 seconds, the ring becomes much much brighter and starts> to radiate.> • 62 -You are seeing now something you have never seen before. And that is> good.> • 63 -Breathe deeply and take a short brake. (One minutes)> • 64 -Repeat the whole exercise from the very top.> • 65 -This should do it for now.> • 66 -Tomorrow, you will practice again.> • 67 -You will do the same thing.> • 68 -Keep on practicing like this for 5 consecutive days.> • 69 -If it did not work, do not give up.> • 70 -Be patient. It will work. It did work for many students. It is simply a> matter or practice, perseverance, and patience.> • 72 -And hopefully, if it did work, the rings you saw around the circles were> the vibrating auras of the circles. Note: According to the Ulema, this exercise opens an extra visual/opticdimension for your eyes and your mind. In fact, it did not open anything new; ithas just activated your visual perception. You had it all the time, but you werenot aware of it. Chabariduri Technique The name of an Anunnaki-Ulema technique/exercise to develop the faculty ofremote viewing.The Ulema taught their students the art and science of remote viewing to improvetheir knowledge, enrich their awareness, and widen their perception of life, andnot to spy on others, as it is the case in the West. Herewith a synopsis of oneof the Ulema remote viewing techniques.Note: The Ulema hand over to each student two small stones of the same size. Stage One:> • 1 -Pick up any stone you want and write on it Aleph “A” (First letter in> many Semitic and ancient Middle/Near Eastern languages)> • 2 -Squeeze on the stone, and try to feel something, anything, or try to> think about something, anything you want.> • 3 -Put the Aleph stone on your desk.> • 4 -Pick up the second stone and write on it Beth “B”.> • 5 -Squeeze strongly on the stone.> • 6-Try to feel something, anything, or try to think about something, anything> you want.> • 7- Put the Beth stone on your desk.> • 8 -Write down on the white paper what did you feel or what did you think> when you touched stone Aleph.> • 9 -Draw a line, and write below the line what did you feel or what did you> think when you touched stone Beth.> Stage Two:> • 10- Now, use the other sheet of paper.> • 10- Take stone Aleph, and put it in your right palm. Close your hand. Close> your eyes.> • 11- Breathe slowly and deeply. Squeeze on the stone, and ask yourself where> did the stone come from. Ask yourself this question 4 times.> • 12- Put down the stone on your desk. Open your eyes. Take the pen and start> writing on the paper what you are thinking about. It does not matter what.> Just write down what your mind is telling you.> • 13 -Now try to guess where did the stone come from.> • 14 -Try to associate the stone with places you know and places you don’t> know.> • 15 -Draw on the paper whatever you see in your mind.> • 16 -Think strongly. You may close your eyes if you want.> • 17 -You still have 2 minutes to finish the test. Stage Three: Note: Now, the Ulema tell the students time is up.One of the students is asked to collect the papers, and he deposits them on thedesk of the Ulema. After having reviewed the students’ answers, the Ulemadirects those who passed the test to move to a designated area in the classroom,and he dismisses the others for now.If all the students failed the test, the session comes to an end, and anothertest will resume the following day.Now, the students are asked to do the same thing with stone Beth. Sameinstructions are given, and same procedures are followed. Those who pass thetest stay in the classroom, and those who failed are dismissed. > • 1 -Now you are going to work with stone Aleph. Stone Beth is no longer> needed.> • 2 -Now you are going to describe the place where the stone came from. You> are going to write down everything you see or think of.> • 3 -Now you will write down on a new sheet of paper, anything you will be> thinking about, anything and everything, no matter how silly or unrealistic it> appears to you.> • 4 -Do not hesitate. Do not doubt yourself. Don’t wait to have a second> thought.> • 5 -Rush your visions, thoughts and feelings to the paper.> • 6 -Now hold the stone in your right hand, and squeeze on the stone firmly> for one minute.> • 7- Put the stone down, and start writing.> • 8- Right down first what you thought first.> • 9- If you feel, or if you think that you know something or anything about> the place where the stone might have come from, write down right away the name> and location of the place. Do not doubt yourself.> • 10- Follow your instinct, follow your thoughts, follow your feelings, follow> your vision, and stop there.> • 11- Now you are there. And you start to see things; people, houses, shops,> gardens, children, trees, water, bicycles, cars, animals…many many things, or> maybe just few things. It doesn’t matter how much you see. Write it down.> • 12 -Now, make a list of you are seeing.> • 13 -Describe what you are seeing.> • 14 -Be precise; give as much details as you can, and name things…be specific> about colors, sizes, forms, shapes, dimensions, locations…anything around,> below and above the items you see.> • 15 -You don’t need to follow any particular order in listing what you see.> First, write down everything you see, later we will sort them out together.> • 16 -Now draw what you see. You don’t have to make a masterpiece. Sketches> are fine. Any kind of sketches. Even small icons, a few lines here and there,> even a series of lines and geometrical forms…draw anything you see or you> think you are seeing.> • 17 -Do not try to force yourself to give any explanation to what you are> seeing or drawing. You will think later about that. Now concentrate on that> place you have found and write down everything you see…draw more pictures…do> not delete anything…add but don’t delete. Note: At the end of the session, the students’ work is evaluated, and comparedwith the data and information about the place subject of the test, and safelyguarded in numbered files.This was a synopsis of the Ulema’s instructions and guidance, and theirstudents’ orientation/training session. This remote viewing exercise is repeatedagain and again on a daily basis for one full month. At the beginning, you needan instructor (Ulema or just an instructor or a guide to tell you what to do).But later on, you will do it on your own. After few practices, you know exactlywhat to do.Daemat-Afnah TechniqueHow to Stay and Look 37 Permanently Term for the process of halting the process of aging.It is composed of two words:a -Daemat, which means longevity.b- Afnah, which means many things, including health, fecundity, and longevity.According to the Anunnaki-Ulema, we are not programmed to age. Understanding human life-span and our body longevity.> > • 1 -Not all parts, membranes, tissues and organs of your body age the same> way and at the same rate.> • 2 -Sometimes, your neck or the skin right under your eyes shows your age,> while your very eyes remain vibrant and young. It is a matter of genes or> cells. This is what science taught us.> • 3 -Although, it is true, we age because our genes get damaged, there are> reasons for aging that are still unknown to science.> • 4 -Some of the non-physical aging factors cannot be detected in> laboratories, because they are not created by purely terrestrial elements.> • 5 -They belong to another dimension, where your blue prints were conceived> and stored.> • 6 -Humans are not programmed to age. I am neither referring to the early> genetic creation of mankind (One million years ago or so), nor to the> primordial seven prototypes created by the An. Na.Ki. (450,000 years ago or> so).> • I am talking about the final specimen of humans that contained the original> 13 mental faculties, some 65,000 years ago.> • 7 -The Anunnaki who live outside time don’t show any indication of aging,> because time does not control their lifespan. Human life is controlled by> time. Anunnaki’s life is free of time, thus time cannot regulate their lives.> • 8 -The Anunnaki have the ability to activate and reactivate their genes in> their laboratories. Although, they are not immortal, and eventually their> cells and genes deteriorate, the Anunnaki can activate the last fully> functional and healthy cell, reproduce it in a large quantity, and activate> each newly created cell separately, in conformity with the many copies and> doubles of an Anunnaki stored in a reversed time-data-storage.> • 9 -The Anunnaki can keep you young for ever, and easily postpone aging> indefinitely. Two of the very first things they do are:> • A -Extending the longevity of your Double by rearranging your stored DNA and> blueprints.> • B -By building a new genetic sequence aimed at resisting stress that causes> damages to your genes in a terrestrial surrounding.> • 10 -The Anunnaki can divide each sequence of your DNA, and add to this> divided sequence, a new genetic code that extends your life span for thousands> of years. Quantum physics and modern medicine sciences do not contradict this. *** *** *** From the Ulema’s Kira’ats.Excerpts from the readings of Master Li, Maximillien de Lafayette and UlemaMordachai Ben Zvi Translated verbatim in conformity with its authentic cach é and linguisticexpressions. > • 1- You can reprogram yourself and adjust your genes. The Anunnaki, Ulema,> and the sages of Melkart taught the enlightened ones and the righteous ones> how to do it.> • 2 -Your body is a machine like so many other machines in the universe, here> on earth and beyond.> • 3 -Some machines run on fuel, others on atomic energy…your body is very> special, and a great mystery, because it runs on a substance known to very few> people in the world. Is it your blood?> Is it the oxygen you breathe in the air?> Is it your soul? Is it the mind of God?> Is it your essence, your Chi, your DNA? Or all of the above? Or perhaps> something we cannot touch, we cannot see, we cannot measure, and consequently> we cannot understand or be sure of?> • 4 -You were taught that the human body is created from a male’s semen and a> female’s eggs. That is very true.> But this semen and these eggs must have “something” extraordinary, something> non-physical to allow a physical human body to perform physical/non-physical> acts such as writing poetry, epics, music, symphonies, and love letters, to> measure light, to reader others’ thoughts, to communicate telepathically, to> fall in love, to think about new ideas, and possibly to escape> laws of physics. This very special and extraordinary “something” is> somewhere…not necessarily in the semen and the eggs…> • 5 -Although, we are all human beings…the truth is, we did not come from the> same origin. Some were born here on earth, others were born somewhere else…in> some other dimensions and far distant spheres. Yet, we have many things in> common, because we were created by the same Khalek (Creator) and his> assistants.> • 6 -We are not an assembly-line product. We are not like automobiles> manufactured and assembled exactly the same way by the same plant.> • 7 -This is why each one of us is different. And this difference exists,> because each one of us was created in a different plant, according to> different specifications and very distinct genetic-programming process.> • 8 -Those who created us know these specifications and what went into our> creation, thus, they can reprogram us, alter our properties, give us a new> form, new faculties, and reduce or increase our life span.> • 9 -At the time we were created (Designed, produced, manufactured, etc.),> three things happened to us, and are directly related to (a) intelligence, (b)> luck/success in life, and (c) health/youth/longevity.> *** *** ***A -The Brain Motor:A brain was designed and instantly tested. The brain was created before the bodytook shape and form. In this brain, all faculties were installed. A copy orblueprints of the brain (Mind) was duplicated and stored in an etheric dimension“ED” (This is the best way we can describe this dimension for now.)This ED is similar to a cosmic net that consists of trillions and millions oftrillions of canals, stations, terminals and channels, all connected together,yet they function separately according to very specific frequencies andvibrations. Once these faculties are installed and begin to function –no matterat what rate or level –, they become a permanent and final fixture of ourthinking process, i.e. intelligence, logic, creativity, etc. However, thesefaculties will get better and better by constant learning and acquiring newknowledge. This is only possible, if the Conduit (Installed by the An. Na. Ki orother non-terrestrials geneticists-creators in your brain’s cells) has more roomfor improvement. The capacity of the Conduit is usually detected at an earlyage, between 3 and 5.Many of the greatest geniuses on earth manifested the Conduit’s capacity andpotentials during this short and early period of time. B -Vibrations, Frequencies, and Luck in Life:Creation of a place for the vibrations of our mind. Nothing in the physical andnon-physical dimensions exists, continues to exist, and functions withoutvibrations and frequencies.When these rays (Vibrations and frequencies) get damaged or cease to radiate oremanate, the organism stops to function. In other words, the brain (Mind) as amotor dies out instantly. When our creators designed this motor during the firststage of manufacturing us, they carefully tested and measured the frequenciesand vibes of the brain, and adjusted the level of its creativity. At this verymoment, they created a space for this creativity, called the vibrationaldimension.Now, if these vibrations resonate in synchronization with the vibrations of thecanals and channels of the cosmic net, the person who has this kind ofvibrations will be a very luck person, but not necessarily a righteous one. Inother words, either you were born lucky, or unlucky, and you are going to staylucky or unlucky for the rest of your life, and there is nothing you can do tochange your luck.However, Master Li said: “It is not totally so…although you have no control overyour destiny and luck, your Conduit will be able to ameliorate your chances ifit is activated by your Double. The sad part of this story is that many of useither do not believe in a Double, nor accept the idea that a Conduit does infact exist in our brains’ cells.” C -The Conduit=Health/Youth/Longevity: Those who have read my books are now familiar with the Conduit. For those whodidn’t, here is a brief description of the nature of the Conduit.Basically, the Conduit is a depot of everything that is YOU; intelligence,emotions, feelings, attributes, qualities, talents, health, dreams, physiognomy,abilities to learn many languages, creativity, endurance, and yes, your futureas well. At the time you were born, a Conduit was installed in the cells of your brain.If the Conduit has been activated, then everything you touch will turn intogold, all your deeds will become honorable, and you will be destined togreatness. If the Conduit remains inactive, you will live a normal life, nothingspectacular about it, and you continue to live a very ordinary life like all theothers.A miniscule, an infinitely small part of the Conduit deals with health, youth,and longevity. And this very small part has been already programmed by those whocreated you. You can’t deprogram it. You can’t find it. And you can’t reach it.It is way beyond your reach and comprehension. So let’s leave it like that fornow. In the Conduit, your life-span has been formulated and its length and/orcontinuity has been decided upon genetically.Some people will die young, other will live 100 years. Some people will grow upto be very tall and physically strong despite lack of nutrition and a good diet,while many others will stay short, fat, or weak despite their healthy lifestyle, good diet, and impeccable hygiene. Physicians and scientists are so quickto say: It is in the genes! And they stop there! But one thing they don’t knowfor sure is what or who created those genes, and according to what guidelines,specs., and creation process?They don’t know. Well, the Ulema do know, because they learned it from theirteachers the An. Na.Ki. You can’t control longevity, youth and your life-span bydeprogramming their genetic codes, because first, you don’t know where to findthese sequences, second, you have no control over the Conduit, and third, youdon’t know how much to add or to subtract from and to the genetic codes.If you do, if you know for a fact, how to prolong the vibrations of thesesequences and how much “stuff” to add to the Conduit, then, and only then, youwill be able to control your life-span. Ulema Marash said: “It is like when youfill your automobile gas tank. The more fuel you put in your tank, the moremileages your car will run. The difference is that, at the gas station, you arein control, because you can decide how much gas you want to buy, but when itcomes to living young for ever, first, you don’t know where the youth station(In comparison to the gas station) is, and second, you are not in control ofyour Conduit (In comparison to your car).”“The good news”, said Ulema Albakr” is that a Conduit can be activated and/orreactivated if training and orientation programs are completed…Enlightenment andblessings are not the monopoly of few…” All these statements are fascinating,but is there a pragmatic and an effective way to either activate the Conduit orto stay and look younger for ever? “What do I have to do to stay young? And yes,I am over 37, but I want to look 37, can you teach me how to do this?” you mightask. Well, here are some of the guidelines and techniques according to thesecret doctrine of the Ulema. Some of the Ulema’s guidelines and techniques Introduction:> • You do not need to buy anything.> • No equipment is needed.> • No physical training is required.> • No diet is imposed.> • No pills to take.> • All what you need is your mind; believing in yourself; convincing yourself> that you are determined to succeed; a great deal of optimism and patience.> Nothing else.> • 1 -Your environment conditions your state of mind, and your way of life.> This is very true.> • 2 -Equally true is the fact that your mind (No matter how educated or> uneducated you are) can also condition your environment and way of life.> • 3 -It is up to you to decide: Would you like to be permanently at the mercy> of your environment and what life and others have imposed upon your, or would> you rather use the power of your mind to change your life for better? It is up> to you!> • 4- Your mind can do miracles for you if you let it. Just believe in it.> • 5- Your mind has the power to make you look healthy and much much younger.> • 6- Your mind is much powerful and durable than your genes and your pumped> muscles. Because your mind can influence your genes and your muscles.> • 7- In doing so, your mind can “freeze time” in your body and postpone aging.> Oh yes, you will grow older, but you will look much younger, despite your old> age.> In fact, your body will never show sign, or any indication of aging if you let> your mind create a new mental setting for your body, and I am going to show> you how…> • 8- First, you choose an age of your choice; this age will stay the same> indefinitely, this is the age that is going to freeze time, and at which you> stop to get older. Wonderful.> • 9- Second, you tell yourself I want to stay 25 or 45 or 37 year old for the> rest of my life, it is up to you (This depends on the age you have chosen.)> • 10- We recommend that you choose the age of 37 if you are older than that.> If you are younger, stay where you are and count your blessings.> • 11- Do not think for a second, just because you have told yourself you want> to stay 37 for ever, that you are going to stay 37 for ever. No! It requires> much more than that.> • 12- For 37 consecutive days, you will tell yourself as soon as you wake up> in the morning: “I am going to stay 37 for ever.” And immediately, you start> to think about all the happy days and wonderful things you enjoyed when you> were 37. You have to do that, otherwise it will never work.> • 13- You have to convince your mind that really you want to stay 37. Once> your mind is convinced, it starts to work on your genes. Do not ask why and> how. It is too complicated. After all, do you want to eat grapes or chase the> bear in your vineyard? Don’t ask too many questions.> • 14- Now, we have to use some imagination here. Oh yes, imagination creates> wonders. So, you start to tell yourself, you are going to relive the time when> you were 37.> • 15- First thing to do is to refresh your memories and remember (as much as> you can) all the wonderful places you have visited when you were 37, the kind> of sport you practiced, the fashion you followed, the movies you saw, the> music you listened to, the car you drove, the entertainment you enjoyed, all> the gifts and presents you> received, and do not forget the young and beautiful girl or man you dated…all> these things must pop up together and simultaneously in your head.> • 16- You will fantasize about all these things, and you will revisit all> these things, you relive and feel all these things the way you felt them when> you were 37. You have to relive these times in your mind every single day for> 37 consecutive days. Do not miss one single day.> • 17- Before you go to sleep, and while you are still awake in your bed,> choose one of those places you have recently visited in your mind. Any place> you want. Very good.> • 18- Go there now. See what is going on there.> • 19- See if your buddies are there.> • 20- Try to find one. You got to find somebody, a pal, a friend, somebody you> had good time with. Good.> • 21- Start talking to your friend. You got to believe in this. No, you are> not crazy, you are doing just fine, and your mind is working perfectly.)> • 22- Engage into a real chat with your friend. Tell jokes. Laugh. Feel the> energy of being young again.> • 23- Now do something else. Tell yourself you want to go on a date. Call your> date. Pick up a place you used to love so much.> • 24- Pick up your date, head straightforward to that place, be brave, kick> the door, and step in.> • 25- Once you are in, you are going to meet lots of good friends, and you are> going to have a ball; eat, drink, sing, dance if you can, enjoy yourself.> • 26- Probably you are sleeping now, and that is good for now. Your mind> needs a rest. Go to sleep.> • 27- Every single day for 37 consecutive days, keep on doing this. Of course,> every time you revisit your life, do something different, but similar to what> you used to do when you were 37.> • 28- Do not do anything different or differently.> • 29- You are still living your normal life; the one you are currently living.> And I bet, now and then you are having> some hard times, and of course some good times too. Now, you have to remember> you have another wonderful life beyond this one.> • 30- The one you visit in the morning and before you go to sleep. So why> don’t you go there right now and dump all these troubles you are having, and> come back in the morning.> • 31- Stay there overnight. It is good for you. Keep telling this to yourself.> And every time you feel bad about something, or somebody is disturbing you,> and you become anxious, exhausted and unhappy, you have to remember that you> have a magical formula nobody knows about…it is your secret…you have the> wonderful life you visit from time to time. It is there. It exists. It> continues to exist, but you forgot about it, because you are living at a> different pace and speed, and you worry so much.> • 32- Now you have been visiting your youth, let’s say for two weeks. And that> is fine. At the end of the third week, you are going to feel so good, you are> not going to believe it. You are going to feel so good about yourself, I> guarantee it.> • 33- Continue to visit your new world. At the end of the 37 day period, your> life will change to better. You will see the difference. But that is not> enough.> • 34- Nothing physically in you has changed yet. Don’t worry. It will happen> sooner than you think. But now, you are shifting gear, you are steamed up, you> are happy about how you feel about yourself, and so, you decided to visit more> often the wonderful place, life and time when you were 37. So go ahead, go> there as often as you can, and as much as you want. It belongs to you. It is> yours!> • 35- If you keep doing this for 6 months – non stop –, you are going to see a> major and mind bending physical transformation in you. Especially on your> face. I will explain…> • 36- Your hair color will not change. If you had grey hair before, well, the> grey hair is still there. If you were bald, sorry, you are still bald. But> your face now is much much younger, and you start to look almost 37. You will> believe it when you will see it, and you are going to see it.> • 37- Gradually, you start to regain your youth, but you are not stopping the> time clock. But what do you care?> • 38- You are not showing sign of aging. You will not have wrinkles on your> face for many years to come. Everybody around you will see the difference. And> those who will meet you for the first time will never guess how old you are!> You will never look your age.> • 39- It is at this very stage of your life, when you will realize for the> first time, that age is not a state of mind, but what mind can do to stay that> way.” *** *** ***Da-Irat Technique Name for Anunnaki’s “Circle Technique” Da-Irat is known to the enlightened onesand Ulema’ adepts as the “Circle Technique” (Da-Ira-Maaref), which means thecircle of knowledge. This technique eliminates stress, through one’s“Self-energy.” In other words, it is an Ulema technique used to energize one’smind and body, and to eliminate worries that are preventing an individual fromfunctioning properly everywhere, including the office, home, social gatherings,etc. In the West, zillions of techniques to reduce stress and counter bad vibeswere proposed. And many of those techniques work very well. The following willexplain the Ulema’s techniques that were in practice for thousands of years inthe Near and Middle East. No physical exercise is required. It is purely mental,although some of the steps to follow might look esoteric or spiritual in nature.These techniques were developed by the early Ulema and members of the “FishCircle”, a brotherhood of the ancient island of Arwad, where allegedly, remnantsof the An.na.Ki (Anunnaki) lived, and developed the Mah-Rit in sophisticatedgenetic labs.The Da-Irat Technique (The Circle Technique) as used by the Fish CircleBrotherhood.Terminology:1 -In Ulemite, it is called Da-Irat (Circle; sphere).2 -In Ana’kh, it is called Arac-ta.3 -In Phoenician, it is called Teth-Ra. Teth is circle or good thing. Ra iscreative energy or first source of life.

To a certain degree, and in a sense, it is like revisiting yourpast, and changing unpleasant events, decisions, choices, and related mattersthat put you where you are today. Excerpts from Ulema Anusherwan Karma Ramali Kira’at, number 165, Introduction toDudurisar, Fasel Wahed (Part one)March 1961, Alexandria, Egypt. Verbatim. Unedited.As reported by Maximillien de Lafayette. I. The Concept: The honorable Ulema spoke:> • 1 -You are not totally satisfied or happy in your current situation, in what> you are doing, and where you are today. You wish you had a different life, a> better job, more opportunities, less troubles and worries.> But there is nothing you can do about it, because the past is the past, and> nobody can change the past. It is done.> • 2 -True, it is very true, you cannot change your past, because it was> Maktoub (Written) in the pages of your fate and destiny book, the day you were> born.> • 3 -Besides, changing or altering the past creates global chaos, confusion,> and dysfunctional order among people, communities and nations.> • 4 -But you don’t have to change your whole past (All events) to become> happier, more successful, and put an end to your misery and tough times.> • 5 -All what you need to do is to change the part or segments (Days, months,> years, places, decisions) that have created hardship, misfortunes and mishaps> in your current life; and this is permissible, possible, ethical and healthy.> • 6 -What part of your life you wish to change or alter, how to do it, and the> reason(s) for doing it are the paramount questions you have to ask yourself> very honestly.> • 7 -Once you have decided to alter a portion or a segment of your past, and> replace this specific segment with new wishes and decisions, you cannot> change, modify or alter the changes you have made.> • 8 -You have to live with it, and you will not have another chance.> • 9 -Something else you should think about (and you should never forget it):> Your family, your children, your current obligations, your commitment to> others, and all the promises you made to people. Because, once you have> changed a major part of your life (Past or present), all these things that you> are dealing with right now will change too, and you might not like it, or> perhaps you might? Everything depends on your intentions, needs and desires.> • 10 -Avoid at all costs and at all time selfishness, greed, escaping from> responsibilities, and vicious intentions. No, you can’t go back in time and> kill all those people who did you wrong, or hurt the woman who turned you> down.> • 11 -You go back in time/space for one reason: Changing unpleasant events and> decisions that unfairly have caused you grief, failures, pain, and> unhappiness.> • 12 -So the keyword here is “Unfairly”. But how would you know what is fair> and what is unfair, as far as your past, your job, your luck, your fortune,> your bank account, you relationships, promotion in your career or profession,> health conditions, peace of mind, and success are concerned?> • 13 -You will, once you have crossed the frontiers of the present-past> sphere.> • 11 -You will not be able to lie to yourself. Once you are behind that thin> curtain, you become a different person; un-materialistic, honest, sincere,> simple, and wise.> • 14 -The world you will enter is as real as the one you live in right now.> • 15 -However, it is much much bigger, prettier, serene, meaningful, and> confusing at the same time, because it has different purposes, unlimited> borders and levels, it is ageless, multidimensional, and contains places,> dates, times, people, unfamiliar creatures, humans and non humans (Women, men,> children, even animals and strange non-physical creatures) you have not met> yet in your life, because they either belong to the future, and/or to> different, multiple, vibrational, parallel worlds. II. The Technique: It works like thisNote: This might frustrate you, because it requires a great deal of patience.Without patience, a strong will, and perseverance, you will not achieve a thing.This technique works. It is up to you to make it work for you. > • 1- First of all, you have to understand that you cannot revisit and change> your past at will, or as you please. There are rules you must follow. And> these rules are closely connected to time, the place where you live, your> intentions, and the specific events you wish to change.> • 2 -For instance, you cannot return in time/space to take revenge, to kill a> person you dislike, or prevent that person from evolving or competing with> you.> • 3 -There are limits to what you can do. You cannot return in non-linear> time/space and create wars or bring destruction to people and communities.> Changing a part or a segment from your past is limited to your sphere.> • 4 -Sphere means your very personal life, your personal actions, your> personal events; things that are closely and exclusively related to you.> • 5 -You have no powers over others.> • 6 -Also you have to understand that you cannot return to the past any day> you want. There is a calendar or more precisely a time table you should fit> it. This means, there are days and hours that are open to you; these days and> these hours allow you to zoom back into your past.> • 7 -Consequently, you must find out what are these days and these hours. You> have to consider yourself as if you were an airplane.> • 8 -An airplane cannot take off or land without a flight schedule, and an> authorization. Consequently, you have to schedule your trip to the past> according to a trip schedule.> • 9 -The trip schedule is decided upon by many factors. The two most important> factors are: a-The activation of your Conduit; b-The most suitable hour for> your trip; this happens when your Double, or at least your astral copy is in a> perfect synchronization with the Ba’ab’s opening. Possibly, you are getting> confused with all these words and conditions. I will try to simplify the> matter for you.> • 10 -To find out what is the most suitable hour to schedule your trip to the> past is to do this: All the letters of the alphabet have a numerical value in> the Ulemite literature, and were explained in the Book of Rama-Dosh. Refer to> Book 2). These numerical values are as follows:> • A numerical value: 1.> • B numerical value: 3.> • C numerical value: 5.> • D numerical value: 7.> • E numerical value: 11.> • F numerical value: 15.> • G numerical value: 16.> • H numerical value: 21.> • I numerical value: 32.> • J numerical value: 39.> • K numerical value: 41.> • L numerical value: 42.> • M numerical value: 44.> • N numerical value: 49.> • O numerical value: 56.> • P numerical value: 58.> • Q numerical value: 62.> • R numerical value: 75.> • S numerical value: 81.> • T numerical value: 83.> • U numerical value: 89.> • V numerical value: 95.> • W numerical value: 98.> • X numerical value: 102.> • Y numerical value: 111.> • Z numerical value: 126.> • 11 -Let’s assume your name is Kamil. Now, let’s find out the numerical value> of Kamil.> • K=41 . Add 4 + 1=5. The number 5 is the numerical value of K.> • A=1 . A is a single digit. The number 1 is the numerical value of A.> • M=44 . Add 4 + 4=8. The number 8 is the numerical value of M.> • I=32 . Add 3 + 2=5. The number 5 is the numerical value of I.> • L=42 . Add 4 + 2=6. The number 6 is the numerical value of L.> • 1 2 -Now, let’s find out the complete numerical value of the whole name of> Kamil. Add the numerical values of all the letters of the word Kamil.> • 13 -We have here: 5+1+8+5+6=27.> • 14 -The numerical value of Kamil is 27. Now add 2+7=9. The number 9> represents the 9 th hour on Kamil’s trip schedule. Always use night hours.> This means that you can’t zoom into your past at a different hour. Just tell> yourself you got to be at the gate at 9 o’clock, exactly as you do when you> take a regular flight at any airport. You have to be on time.> • 14 -Now, we have to find out the day of the trip (Zooming into the past.)> Only on this day you will be able to do so.> • 15 -Take the “Triangle” you have used in practicing your “ Gubada-Ari”> technique> • 16 -Place the Triangle on the globe. If you have done this previously and> found out your best spots on the globe, then, take the number corresponding to> that particular spot. Remember there are 4 small triangles, and each triangle> has a number on it (From 1 to 4 on the Six Pointed Star.)> • 17 -Let’s assume that the corresponding small triangle’s number is 3. What> does 3 represent? Or any of the 4 numbers of the four small triangles in any> case?> • 18 -On Earth, the week consists or 7 days. In the Anunnaki-Ulema Falak,> there are no weeks, no days and no time, because time is equated differently> beyond the third dimension. Instead, the non-terrestrial beings have four> spatial sequences, each representing four different spheres beyond the fourth> dimension. Don’t worry about these spheres. For now learn this: The number 3> you found on the globe means the third day of the Anunnaki-Ulema calendar.> • 19 -The Anunnaki-Ulema calendar consists of the following: 4 days (So to> speak). And the four days are (In a figurative speech) 1-Tuesday; 2-Wednesday;> 3-Friday; 4-Saturday. Forget all the other days.> • 20 -This means that your zooming day is Friday. And the departure is at 9> (See bullet#14).> • 21 -Now, we know the day and the hour. What’s next?> • 22 -Now, we have to find the gate (Ba’ab).> • 23 -The gate is usually very close to you. This gate is not the “Spatial> Ba’ab”, but your mental launching pad.> • 24 -The most practical launching pad is any place where nobody can interfere> with this technique.> • 25 -Use your private room, make sure nobody is around.> • 26 -Place the Triangle on your desk, or on any solid and stable surface.> • 27 -Sit in a comfortable chair behind your desk, close enough to place both> hands parallel to the triangle.> • 28 -Take a deep and long breath, approximately four or five seconds. Repeat> this three times.> • 29 -In your mind, project two lines exiting from the top corner of the> triangle. In other words, let the lines of the both sides (left and right) of> the triangle continue outside the triangle leaving from the top corner.> • 30 -In your mind, create a new triangle starting from the top of the> triangle you already have on the desk, and just formed by the extension of the> two lines you have mentally created.> • 31 -Now you are looking at this new triangle sitting on the top of the other> triangle. We are going to call it “Mira”.> • 32 -At each corner of the Mira, you are going now to put something.> • 33 -For example, at the base, which is upside down (left side), choose the> year you want to visit.> • 34 -At the base, which is upside down (right side), pick up the event you> want to revisit. By event, I mean something you have done, such as a decision,> a job you had, a responsibility you have assumed, a trip you made,> an encounter you had. In other words, the thing you want to change or alter> from your past.> • 35 -At the lower corner of Mira which is joining your triangle on the desk,> put the “new thing” or “new wish” you want to use to change or alter something> you have done. Remember: You have already chosen what you want to change; it> is already placed at the right side (upside down) of the triangle (See> bullet#34).> • 36 -Now, everything is in place. You have on the left side, the year you> want to visit; on the right side, you have the event or the thing you want to> change, and on the reversed corner of the triangle you have the new thing you> want to bring to your past so it could change or alter the things you want to> remove from your past.> • 37 -Your final mental projection is this: Draw in the triangle a circle, and> make it spin or rotate in your mind.> • 38 -Let the circle spin as fast as possible.> • 39 -Keep telling your mind to order the circle to spin. And concentrate on> the rotation of the circle as strong as possible. Stay in this mode as long as> it takes until you see the circle increasing in size.> • 40 -When you begin to feel that the circle is getting big enough to contain> all the corners of the triangle, at this very moment, and in your mind, push> out of the circle all the contents of the right side corner, and immediately> refill it with your wishes.> • 41 -Bring the refill to the left side corner.> • 42 -Anchor it in the chosen year.> • 43 -In your mind, close the right side corner.> • 44 -In your mind, close the bottom corner of the triangle.> • 45 -In your mind, stay with the year you are visiting now.> • 46 -You are now seeing lots of things; scenes from your past, people you> knew, it depends where you are, in other words, your past as it happened at> that place and during that year has been reconstructed. Not hundred per cent> physically, but holographically, and in this holographic projection, the> essence, fabric and DNA of> everything that happened are brought back to life in a different dimension, as> real as the one you came from.> • 47 -Remember, nothing is completely destroyed in the world. Nothing comes to> a total and permanent end. Everything is transformed, retransformed, and quite> often recycled. You can recreate the original fabric of everything that> happened in your past by recreating the DNA sequence of past events, in> revisiting the parallel dimension that has never lost the print and copy of> original events. It is this very parallel dimension that you are revisiting> now mentally. Ulema enter that dimension physically and mentally. But because> you are still a student, you will only revisit that dimension mentally and> holographically.> • 48 -You are now revisiting and re-living past times in another dimension.> Even though, you are experiencing this extraordinary phenomenon and> interacting with re-structured events, you will not be able to bring to your> physical world the changes you have made in the parallel dimension, because> you cannot transport them to a different dimension. They exist only in that> holographic reality, which never ceased to exist.> • 49 -However, you will be able to bring back with you the effects and> positive results that such changes have created by altering the past. Those> results created in a different dimension will materialize physically in your> real life, and you will be able to sense and recognize their effects in a very> realistic manner, in all things closely related to their nature.> • 50 -In fact, what you have done is changing or totally eliminating the> negative and destructive effects of things and decisions you have made in your> past. And this is what really counts. Because you have substituted bad results> with good results.> • 51 -Those results will continue in your current life when you return to your> physical world, and will prevent future bad incidents and bad things from> occurring again> in your current life. Worth mentioning here that the kind of bad experiences> you had in your past will never happen again to you. You have blocked them for> good. How real is the holographic/parallel dimension you are visiting?It is fantasy? Is it hallucination? Is it day-dreaming? It is wishful thinking?None of the above. It is as real as your physical world. Everything you see andfeel in this materialistic/physical world exists also (Identically) in otherworlds.But their properties are different. Nevertheless, they look exactly identical.Even the smallest details are preserved. So what you will be seeing during yourtrip is real. What happened in the past still exists in other dimension, andfollows rules that our mind cannot understand.That incomprehensible and wonderful dimension does not only contain events,peoples, and things from your past, but also whatever is currently occurring onEarth.In other words, you as a human being living on this planet, and working as ateacher or as a physician, you are simultaneously living and working as ateacher or as a physician in a parallel dimension. You may not have the samename or nationality, but your essence, persona and psycho-somaticcharacteristics are the same.In fact, you live simultaneously in many and different worlds. Perhaps, and aswe speak, there is another person who looks exactly like you in a differentdimension is trying to visit you here on Earth, or perhaps, as we speak he/sheis so curious to know if you look like him/her, what are you doing, are youaware of him/her in other dimension? Highly advanced copies of you are fullyaware of your characteristics and existence on this planet.If he/she is older than you in linear time, then he/she is from your past. Ifhe/she is younger than you, than he/she is from your future. But in all casesand in all scenarios, you are one and the same person living at the same time indifferent places, each place functioning according to different laws of physics,or lack of laws of physics. So, when you revisit your past in a differentdimension, prepare yourself to meet another copy of you, or simply YOU in adifferent non-linear space/time existence. Many adepts who have visited thatdimension did not want to return back. In fact, some Talmiz-Ulema remainedthere. But as you know by now, their copies remained on Earth.Final words on your visit to the parallel world you have visited using theDudurisar technique. While you are there, you will not have terrestrialsensorial properties, because your physical body is still in your room, whereyou began, however, a sort of a spatial memory you will pick up on your way tothe parallel dimension, and will substitute for physical feelings andimpressions. This spatial memory you had in you all your life, but you neverknew you had it, because you have not entered another non-linear dimensionbefore now. It will come handy, and will help you to remember or identifythings.While you are there, you will have all the opportunities of :a -Meeting many of your past friends (Dead or alive, so to speak in terrestrialterms), perhaps loved pets you lost;b -Making new friends, and this could sadden you knowing that you will bereturning home;c -Watching the re-happening of future events, as if you were watching a film(you saw before) backward;d -Learning from new experiences and results you can use when you return home.The time will come, when you become capable of realizing and understanding themany lives and existences you have now, had, or will acquire in the future.> Some of the benefits:> • 1 -Your mind (On its own) knows when it is time to return home.> • 2 -Some people have reported the sadness they felt when they realized that> they had to return home. Many did not want to return home, because they have> discovered a better place, made new friends, and lived a life –even though> extremely short – free of worries and troubles. This could happen to you. But> your brain is stronger than your wishes, and you will return safe.> • 3 -On you way back, your mind will reassure you that everything is going to> be just fine, and that you have succeeded in removing some stains, copies of> disturbing events from your past, and above all the effects of past actions> and events that have handicapped you in this life.> • 4 -Your mind will retain all the knowledge you have acquired, and will guide> you more efficiently in all your future decisions.> • 5 -Numerous people have reported that their journey was beneficial, because> for some incomprehensible reasons, many of the problems and difficulties they> have faced before evaporated in thin air. Closing the Technique:> • 1 -For this particular technique, you mind will close the technique by> itself.> • 2 -You will wake up, and you will realize that you were somewhere else, far,> far away from your room.> • 3 -You open your eyes, and all of a sudden, a delightful and reassuring> sensation will invade your being. You feel energized, more confident, and in a> total peace with yourself. *** *** ***Bari-du Technique Baridu is the Anunnaki-Ulema term for the act of zooming into an astral body ora Double. We have used the expression “Astral body”, because of the Westernreaders’ familiarity with what it basically represents. This representation isnot the depiction usually used by the Ulema, but it is close enough, to use itin this work. Bari-du: The Concept > • The initiated and enlightened ones can zoom into their other bodies, and> acquire Anunnaki supernatural faculties.> • I have used the words supernatural faculties instead of supernatural powers,> because the enlightened and initiated ones are peaceful, and do not use> physical power, brutal force or any aggressive means to reach their> objectives.> • The use of violence against humans and animals, even aggressive thoughts and> harmful intentions annihilate all chances to acquire Anunnaki’s extraordinary> faculties.> • Your Double can easily read your thoughts.> • If your thoughts are malicious, your Double will prevent you from zooming> yourself into its ethereal molecules.> • Therefore, you have to control your temper, remain calm, and show serenity> in your thoughts, intentions and actions.> • You Double is very delicate, even though it can accomplish the toughest> missions and penetrate the thickest barriers.> • Any indication of violence or ill intention triggers a pulse that blocks> your passage to the ethereal sphere of your Double.> • Once you enter your Double, you will be able to use it in so many beautiful> and effective ways as:> 1. A protective shield against danger,> 2. An effective apparatus to protect yourself in hostile and dangerous> situations,> 3. A tool to develop your abilities to learn many languages, and enhance your> artistic creativity,> 4. A stimulus to increase the capacity of your memory,> 5. Instrument to heal wounds and internal injuries. No, you will not become a> surgeon, but you will be able to stop internal bleeding, and eliminate pain,> 6. A vehicle to visit distant places and even enter restricted areas for good> causes. The possibilities are endless.> • Once you are in a perfect harmony with your Double, and your physical> organism is elevated to a higher vibrational level through your union with> your Double, you will be able to walk through solid substances such as walls,> sheets of glasses and metal.> • You become effective in controlling metal and de-fragmenting molecules of> any substance. This will allow you to transmute, change and alter the> properties of any object known to mankind.> • But if you use these supernatural faculties to hurt others, or for personal> and selfish gain, you will loose them for good, and you will be accountable> for such malicious use in the other dimension. And this could delay your> entrance through the Ba’ab. > • Before you were born, and before your body took shape, you (as a human> being) have existed somewhere as an idea.> • What is this idea? We will give you an example. Before a product is mass> produced, inventors and artists design and create a model or a prototype of> each product. And everything begins with the drawing board.> • On this board, shape, form, dimensions, colors and specifications of the> product are defined and illustrated. It started with an idea. The idea became> a project and the project found its existence on the drawing board. In fact,> everything in life started with an idea, continued with a sketch before it> reached its final form, and eventually the market.> • Your physical body is a perfect product. And this product came from an idea> like everything that has been created. Nothing comes from nothing.> • Who came up with this idea? This depends on your religious beliefs. If you> believe in the Judeo-Christian tradition, then, your God is the originator of> this idea. He created the first draft of your physical body on his drawing> board.> • Most certainly, God had to think about how your body should look like. On> the Judeo-Christian drawing board of the creation of mankind, God decided how> the physical body should come to life.> • You are much more important than a commercial product or a commodity like a> car, or a soda bottle. The designers, artists and engineers at the automobile> factory and plant spent many hours designing the model of the car, and the> manufacturers of the soda bottle spent some good time going through various> designs of the shapes and looks of bottles before they chose the most suitable> design for their product.> • Now, if you think that you are more important than a car or a bottle, then,> it is logical to assume that somebody has spent some time designing you,> otherwise, you will surface as a non-studied and not well-researched product.> • If you look at your body very carefully, you will find out that your body is> an extremely complicated machine and your brain consists of a very intricate> wiring system that requires an engineer or at least a first class designer.> • In summary, you did not come right away without a plan, without a> well-thought design, and without an idea that created the design and execution> of your physical body.> • At the very beginning and early stage of the creation of your physical body,> the “Divine” or “Superior” architect-engineer conceived your physical looks as> a picture in the astral world.> • And the astral world for now call it: The world of ideas; a non-physical> world. In a non-physical world, everything is non-physical, it is astral, it> is ethereal.> • When the ethereal image or idea becomes reality and adopts physical> properties like eyes, legs, feet and bones, this idea or your “prototype”> becomes a physical body and enters the physical world via the womb of your> mother.> • Yet, it remains deeply and directly connected to the draft of the first copy> of your physical body.> • Since the first draft of your non-physical body and your recently acquired> physical body (Or about to be developed in the womb of your mother) are still> connected to each other, both bodies (The Idea or Draft and your physical> body) co-exist.> • The physical body is inside your mother, and the non-physical body called> double or first body exists outside the physical world.> • The other copy, or more precisely the first copy of YOU is called your> Double.> • As soon as you begin to develop as a small physical body (a small fetus)> inside the womb of your mother, the idea or draft that created you before you> entered the womb of your mother begins to feed your brain’s cells and program> your intellect.> • In other words, your brain begins to receive all the information and> characteristics that will create and define your personality, temper,> character, persona and nature.> • During the very first 40 days, everything your “Creator” wanted you to be or> become start to “go inside your brain” and in the physiology of your body.> • During this very critical intellectual and physical formation, the other> aspect of you, your Double, enters a dimension very close to your mother, and> once your mother delivers you, your double, the non-physical body will leave> the “surroundings” of your mother and follow you.> • From this moment on, your Double will stay with you until you die.> • The double interacts with us in a most fascinating way, noticeable only to> the “small child we are”, and not to the others. Many children have seen their> double. And many of them spoke to their double, and played with their double.> • In many instances, babies and children called their double “my friend”, or> “a friend who came to visit me.” Unfortunately, many parents discouraged their> small children from talking about their “imaginary friends”, or fantasizing> about the visits of their unseen friends.” This is very common.> • Ulema children are encouraged to talk about their “imaginary friends”.> • These are very precious moments in our lives, because during this stage, the> infant and later on, the small child, has a direct access to his/her double.> • If the child is deprived from this contact, the Double could dissipate for> ever.> • Of course, in the future, the Double might appear again on certain> occasions.> • But, because we have lost touch with our Double, and we no longer remember> the beautiful and friendly visits of our forgotten imaginary friends, our mind> and common sense will automatically dismiss the sudden apparition of our> Double as a reality. In these instances, people quite often say: “I am seeing> things”, or “Am I hallucinating?” Therapists rush so quickly to explain the> phenomenon as a trick by the mind.> • It is not a trick at all. It just happened that your Double is paying you a> visit. Instead of questioning your sanity, you must rejoice and welcome your> “friend”. In fact, your Double is the most truthful, caring and best friend> you ever had, simply because it is YOU!> • Your Double appeared to you for many reasons.> • Your “double” always watches over you. It cares about you. Its presence is a> sign of friendship, sometimes necessary and indispensable for solving your> problems and finding a way to get out of trouble. You should welcome your> Double and listen to.> • The initiated ones can contact their Double; it is a matter of learning,> practice and patience. However, you have to remember, that the living cannot> contact the dead. By reaching the sphere of your Double or Astral Body, you> are reaching yourself, not a dead substance, a departed entity or a spirit.> • Untrained persons cannot contact their Double, but can be trained and taught> by the Ulema. And the training has nothing to do with magic, spiritism or> religious trances and state of ecstasy. It is purely mental, intellectual, and> scientific.> • Here, we will be talking about two situations:> • First situation: Your Double materializes before you on its own,> • Second situation: You initiate the contact with your Double.> • Sometimes, the Astral Body materializes before you eyes, even though you did> not try to contact it. This apparition has many meanings, and could be> interpreted differently according to the circumstances.> • Sometimes, your Double appears to you to warn you against an imminent> danger. Sometimes, to guide you in a moment of despair and difficulties.> • Some other times, when you “see yourself” as a fragile ectoplasmic thin> substance like a fog for instance, your Double apparition is telling you, that> a very important event is going to happen and it could change the course of> your life.> • In rare instances, this apparition could mean that your days are numbered.> Short after Lord Byron saw his Double he passed way.> • In the second situation: Now, you are trying to contact your Double. You> initiate the contact. If you are not one of the enlightened persons, you would> not know what to do, and where to start. Like everything in the universe,> including speeches and lectures…everything begins with an introduction and> ends with an epilogue. This is the right path. In contacting your Double, you> must have an introduction that comes in the form of an entry or entrance into> the “Al-Madkhal”.> • Al Madkhal means verbatim: Entrance and/or where you step in. Ba’ab is a> spatial place that exists around the physical dimension of our world. In the> Anunnaki-Ulema vocabulary, Ba’ab means verbatim: Door. And from and through> this door you enter the other dimension where your astral body (Your Double)> exists. In the West, ufologists, and even space scientists nickname Ba’ab “Stargate.” Itis not totally correct, because to them, stargate is a gate through whichspaceships can travel through the infinity of space and conquer space-time, thusreducing the enormous distances between stars and planets, and reachingdestinations in the universe at a speed greater than the speed of sound andlight.For the Ulema, the Ba’ab can be used as a spatial stargate, and a mental meansto reach the non-physical world as well; no spaceships are needed to communicatewith your Double. *** *** *** > Questions About The Anunnaki-Ulema Techniques____________________________ Why The Conduit Is Not Catching Your Messages? Question 1:Would you please explain further the passage below, and tell me why my Conduitis not catching all the messages I am sending to my Conduit? Does this mean thatmy Conduit is not receiving clear messages from me? How can I send clearmessages to my Conduit? Passage: “The Conduit will absorb the vibrations andorganize them, and from that moment on, the Conduit will take over. Tosummarize, by attempting certain activities, you are sending a message to yourConduit.It will take some time, because at the beginning, your Conduit may not catch themessages, or if it does catch them, may not interpret the messages correctly,because the Conduit is not one hundred percent awake. With practice, the Conduitbecomes familiar with these type of messages, and it begins to give them codes.Each activity would have its own code.” Answer to Question 1:> • First of all, you have to remember that your mind (Your brain) has nothing> to do with your Conduit. Even though, your brain is functioning wonderfully> and you are doing great things in your life, not all the cells in your brain> have been used.> • There are so many regions in our brain that have not been explored yet by> science.> • In those many unexplored regions of the brain, are so many cells yet to be> discovered, located and localized. And above all, we need to learn how they> function.> • In that mysterious undiscovered region of the brain, the Condu it exists. It> could be in the right or left side of your brain, or just adjacent to line> dividing the two parts.> • In the Conduit, there are so many cells, each one with a very defined and> particular extraordinary faculty/power, that needs to be activated.> • For instance, one cell triggers the faculty of reading others’ thoughts,> another cell (Or cells) is responsible for the faculty of teleportation, so> on.> • If those cells are not activated, you will not be able to do all those> wonderful things.> • So, you have to consider the Conduit as a bank where so many cells are> deposited. And there are hundreds of thousands of cells deposited in the> Conduit.> • Each cell has a precise function and an invisible location.> • This means that the Conduit can do so many things, if cells are activated.> It would be impossible in one lifespan to develop and activate all the cells.> • Three or four fully activated cells is more than enough. With four> activated cells you can do four great miracles by earth’s standards.> • But for the cell to produce this extraordinary power, the cell must be able> first to understand what you want to do.> • For instance, you cannot tell or command your cell “go ahead and make me> fly or let me learn a new language in one hour.”> • You should first learn how to send your command to your cell. There is a> technique for this.> • Your Ulema teacher knows how to put you on the right track.> • Let’s assume you have sent a message (A thought, a wish) to your cell.> What’s next? Well, the message enters your Conduit. Your conduit acting as a> supervisor, and as the main receiver reads your message and directs your> message to the appropriate cell.> • Your Conduit knows which cell is activated and designed to comply with your> request.> • Instantly, the cell receives the Conduit transfer (Meaning your message.)> • Then what? The cell reads your message.> • If your message was sent correctly, then the cell will accept it and give> it a code. So, if in the future you ask again your Conduit to do the same> thing you have asked in the past, the cell will execute your request in a> fraction of a second.> • In other words, each request is coded, and stored in your cell.> • Only coded messages are stored in your Conduit.> • How would you know if you have or have not sent a message correctly to your> Conduit? You will know right away. It is very simple. If you have not been> trained, you wouldn’t know where and how to start in the first place.> • This is the reason why your Conduit did not catch your message(s). You asked> “Does this mean that my Conduit is not receiving clear messages from me? And> the answer is yes! Your Conduit received something, a thought, a feeling, a> wish, a request, call it whatever you want, but your message was not clear to> your Conduit, because you did not send your message according to the rules.> • What are these rules?> • They are explained below. But continue to read this first.> • And then you asked: “And how can I send clear messages my Conduit can catch> and understand?> • You have to use the “Transmission of Mind” technique. Practice this> technique before you send messages to your Conduit. For example, in the past,> the SOS (Morse Code) was used by ships, planes, military troops and others.> The person who has sent the message (Morse) knew the Code; he/she knew how to> tap it. Each word had a code…one dot, two dots, three dots, one dash, two> dashes, three dashes, one dit, two dits, one space, two spaces, three spaces,> etc. There is a sequence of pulses and marks. And the person who received the> message knew how what these dots, and dashes meant. This is how and why he/she> was able to read the message or decipher it, if it was a secret message. Your> Conduit works exactly in the same way.> • Your Ulema teacher will tell you exactly what dots and sequences to use.> • If your Conduit is hundred percent awake, meaning Open (After training> completion), the Conduit will immediately interpret/translate and understand> your dots, dashes and sequences.> • Consider those dashes and dots a “Password”, a log-in information, a key to> open the contact with your Conduit, just like the password you use to open> your computer or have access to some websites.> • In the book, you will find several passages referring to the brain waves> and mind frequencies, and some techniques used to direct thoughts and mind> energies. The Opening of the Conduit Question 2:Is the Conduit something like the Third Eye Lopsang Rampa talked about? Does itneed an operation to open it up? Rampa said that he went through surgery to openhis third eye? Answer to Question 2:The Conduit has nothing to do at all with the Third Eye.It appears from the writings of Lopsang Rampa, that the opening of the Third Eyerequires surgery. I am not very familiar with the Third Eye’s medical proceduresand what takes place during the surgery. According to the Ulema’s teachings, theConduit opening does not require a surgical operation. It is a state ofenlightenment. And enlightenment does not happen with the use of medical tools.The Opening of the Conduit is a mental exercise. It requires many things such asintrospection, deep concentration, guided meditation, following a specific diet,and above all understanding how the brain emits and receives frequencies andvibes.In Ulemite’s literature, the word Conduit is used instead of brain. But theConduit is much more powerful than the brain, even though it is located in aminiscule area of the brain. The Conduit governs and animates the brain and allthe cells of the human brain, this is why it is more powerful than the brain.However, the brain can function perfectly without the help of the Conduit. But,the brain on its own, and without the help of the Conduit rarely producesextra-ordinary, supernatural powers. The Godabaari technique: Moving Objects at Distance Question 3:In the Godabaari technique, step 12, you said “In your mind, draw one line fromthe middle of your left wrist, and another line from the middle of your rightwrist, toward the coaster. Visualize the coaster between the two lines.” Doesthis mean that I will be able to see those two lines with my own eyes, or simplyI would be imagining the lines in my head? Something else I would like to know,how long it would take me to learn this technique, and would I be able to moveheavier stuff at distance? How heavy? How much heavier than a coaster? How longdoes it last? It is a one time thing? Is it magic, faith or what? I am a goodChristian and I have a strong faith in the Lord and Jesus. Does this help? Answer to Question 3:On faith: Then, you must be familiar with what Jesus Christ has said aboutfaith? “And He said to them, “Because of the littleness of your faith; for trulyI say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to thismountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will beimpossible to you.”Faith is always good, but it has nothing to do with learning and successfullypracticing this technique.The knowledge, the doctrine, the techniques and the teachings of Anunnaki-Ulemaare based upon science, para-physical means, and empirical observations. TheUlema do not ask their students and adepts to have a religious faith or anysimilar faith, because they do not mix religion with their learning/teaching.The Ulema do neither consider one religion (Or a faith) superior to anotherreligion, nor accept “Faith” as an effective/pragmatic way to discover and learnthe truth. So, unfortunately, your faith will not play any role in understandingand mastering the Godabaari technique. “Use your mind, instead”, said the Ulema.Concerning those two lines: Yes, you will be able to see those two lines withyour own eyes. You will not be imagining anything. They are not virtual. Thelines are real. How long it would take you to learn this technique? Not verylong, if you practice the technique at least three times a week. Would you beable to move heavier stuff at distance?Yes! After a consistent practice for at least 6 months. How heavy? Heavy enough,but not as big or as heavy as a mountain. There is a limit to everything inlife. By the power of his mind, an old Mongolian Ulema was able to lift up atruck, and dump it in a lake. You have asked: How much heavier than a coaster?And the answer is: Much heavier than a coaster.Use your own assessment and judgment, short after you have succeeded in moving aslightly heavier object than a coaster. It is fun! How long does it last? It isa one time thing? Once you have learned this technique, it stays with you forever. The Gomari “Gumaridu” Technique Question 4:In the Gomari “Gumaridu” technique, number 15 , you said: “Start with a lineartask, which will anchor you. The best one will be the trip to the airport, andfor this task no Anunnaki-Ulema powers are used at all. Even though your Conduitis not open, since you have not been trained by a master, it is still there andit can calculate what it needs to do, and how to partially and gradually squeezethe other tasks into the frame of seven hours. ”My question is this: Does this mean that my Conduit works on its own, by itself,and does things outside my control? If my Conduit knows what to do, such assqueezing the other tasks into the frame of seven hours, why then my Conduit hasto stop there? Why my Conduit does not go one step further? Where does theConduit stop? Answer to Question 4:Yes, your Conduit has its own mode. As long as your Conduit is not activated, itremains free of your control. Once your Conduit is activated, you become thestimulus and the manager of your Conduit. Pay attention to the word “Partially”.This is very significant. The Conduit works partially when it is not activated.And partially means reacting by not acting.The Conduit functions all the time regardless of your state of awareness,enlightenment or readiness. But it will not give you data and information.Everything the Conduit finds is instantly deposited in its compound. You willnot find what’s in there, until the Conduit is fully activated. Consider it fornow as a depot of knowledge; a sort of a personal bank account where your dailybalance is constantly increasing, however, you are not allowed to have access toyour bank account.So, nothing is lost. Your Conduit collects and stores information all the time,and from various sources, times, and spheres. Godabaari’s projected mental lines toward the coaster Question 5:In the Godabaari technique, step 12, you said: “ In your mind, draw one linefrom the middle of your left wrist, and another line from the middle of yourright wrist, toward the coaster. Visualize the coaster between the two lines.”Why the wrist is so important? Why this particular place in our body? Why do weneed two lines from both wrists?> Answer to question 5:The wrist is so important because it is the base of your hand, where your energyis stored. From the hands emanate the rays of your inner energy, called Rou’am.The Chinese compare it to Chi; the Japanese to Ki. Here, they are referring toan inner energy which is an internal physical energy. On the surface, and to theinexperienced, the Ki or Chi resembles Rou’am. But in fact, it is quitedifferent, because Rou’am is not physical at all. If it was physical, it shouldbe enough to use it as a rod or a stick to move the object with, and simplifythe whole process. Bear in mind, that all sorts of energies in the forms ofvibrations, frequencies and rays emanate from your body.In fact, each gland, organ and part of your body has a specific vibrationdefined by its intensity, colors, emission length and waves strength. Sometimes,we call it Aura, and some other times, bio-organic radiation. Still, it is notRou’am. So Ki, Chi, and Aura are not your Rou’am, simply because they areproduced by the composition of your physical body, while the Rou’am is producedby your brain. You brain has to find a way to eject Rou’am. It does so, byreleasing it from your wrist, channeling it to your fingers’ tips, and exitingit from the top of your fingers.You need two lines to create a visual-spatial equilibrium. As it is necessary inclassical arts to create/preserve beauty, symmetry is also and equally essentialand necessary in Godabaari technique. On that principle, Taj Mahal wasvisualized and built. The same thing applies in our technique.Mental projection of a visual symmetry eliminates chaos in your brain, andparticularly in the difficult process of creating balance and harmony forsomething you can’t touch physically. When you look at the coaster, you just seea coaster.But you need to frame the coaster into a visual equilibrium. This equilibriumlimits the extra dimension of the coaster you don’t see. The two lines confinethe coaster. The coaster cannot escape the space defined by the two lines youbrain has created. And this is how your concentrate your mental energy right onthe coaster.It is this very concentrated mental energy that makes the coaster move in itspreliminary phase.If you use one line only, the coaster will escape, and your mental power has tochase the coaster, instead or trapping it, and controlling the physical place itoccupies. What basically the two lines are doing is emptying the space fromunder the coaster. This void destabilizes the coaster, and immediately the twolines take advantage of this, and begin to dispose it, shake it, and finallymake it move. Anunnaki’s Miraya and Akashic Records Question 6:In the Chapter Gomatirach-Minzari, you said: “ Those who are familiar with theconcept of the Anunnaki’s Miraya would notice a resemblance in the way thesetools are used. However, one should realize that we are not pretending to usethe kind of cosmic monitor that is connected, through the Akashic Libraries onNibiru, to the Akashic Record itself. It is beyond our scope to even conceivehow such a tool had ever been created. Nor are we attempting to recreate thekind of Minzar that is used by the Anunnaki-Ulema, who are enlightened beingswhose Conduit has been opened. “I am not familiar with the Anunnaki’s Miraya. What is it?How does it work? And what connection it has with the Akashic Records? Also, Iwould like to know more about the Anunnaki’s libraries. Answer to question 6 :On Ashtari, the Planet of the Anunnaki (Ne.Be.Ru or Nibiru, to others) eachAnunnaki (male and female, young and adult) has a direct access to the FalakKitbah (Akashic Records) through the Akashic Libraries (Called Shama Kitbah),which are located in every community in Ashtari. The libraries (Called Makatbaor Mat-Kaba) are constructed from materials such as chiselled opaque glass(Called Mir-A’t), a substance similar to fibreglass (Called Sha-riit), and amultitude of fibre-plastic-like materials (Called Fisal and Hiraa-Ti); theyconvey the appearance of ultra-modern, futuristic architecture (By humans’standards), and techno- industrialized edifices.One enters the libraries through an immense hall (Called Isti-bal), sevenhundred to one thousand meters in length, by five hundred meters in width. TheIsti-bal is empty of any furniture, and is lit by huge oval windows that areplaced near the top of the ceiling. The windows (Called Shi-bak) were designedin such a way that the shafts of light that enter through their circularcompartments are redirected and projected like solid white laser beams. Theeffect is spectacular. At night, quasi identical effect is produced by theprojection of concentrated light beams coming from hidden sources of lightslocated behind (More precisely, inside the frames’ structure) the frames (CalledMra) of the windows. The frames serve as an energy depot.The energy is transformed into sources of light. The visual effect is stunning.Enormously large and animated metallic billboards (Called La-yiha, pronouncedLa-ee-haa) are affixed on walls in a parallel alignment, and on the floor, infront of each billboard, there are hundreds of symmetrically rectangular pads(Called Mirkaan). When visitors enter the library’s main hall (Situated just atthe front entrance), they approach the billboards, and stand each on a Mirkaan.The pad serves as a scanner and a transportation device, because it has thecapacity to read the minds of the visitors, learn what they are searching for,and as soon as it does so, it begins to move, and slides right through thecentral billboard (Called Kama La-yiha), which is not really solid but is madefrom blocks of energy, carrying the visitor with it. Behind the billboard is themain reading room (Called Kama Kira’at) of the Akashic Library.Under the belly of the pad, there are two separate compartments designed toregister what the visitor is looking for, and to direct the visitor to his/herdestination; usually, it is a reference section where books in form of cones arelocated on magnetized shelves.The Anunnaki’s Akashic Library is not a traditional library at all, for itcontains no physical books per se, even though, there are plenty of conicpublications (Books manufactured as magnetic cylinders and cones.) Instead ofsearching for books on shelves, as we do on Earth, the visitors find themselvesin the presence of an immense white-light blue screen, made of materials unknownto us. The screen is hard to describe; it can be compared to a grid (CalledKadari), with a multitude of matrices and vortices of data. The visitorscommunicate with the screen via their Conduit. The screen registers theirthoughts and right away finds/records the information the visitors seek. All thevisitors have to do is stand still for less than two seconds (In terrestrialterms) in front of the screen, and the data will be displayed in an animatedformat. The data (Information) is given in codes which are easily understood bythe visitors. The codes are usually divided into sequences; each sequencereflects an aspect of the information.For example, if you want to know what happened in Alexandria or Phoenicia 3000B.C., all what you need to do, is to think about either Alexandria or Phoenicia,and one grid will appear, waiting for your command to open it up. From thisprecise moment, the visitor’s Conduit and the Screen are communicating in themost direct fashion.The grid opens up and displays three files in sequence.The nearest description of these files would be plasmic-digital, for the lack ofthe proper word; each file will contain everything that had happened pertainingto that particular date or era in Alexandria or Phoenicia. Functions of the Conduit, Miraya and retrieving data: > • 1 -The Conduit will sort out all the available information and references> (Photos, holographic projections, sounds) available on the subject. On> Ashtari, everything is stored in codes.)> • 2 -The Conduit selects and indexes the particular data for the part of the> information the visitor is most interested in.> • 3 -Then, the selected information (Complete data in sound and images) is> instantly transferred to the cells of the visitor’s brain.> • 4 -Because Anunnaki are connected to each other and to their community via> the Conduit, the data recently absorbed is sent to others who share similar> interest. This is extremely beneficial, because if the data received from the screen isdifficult to understand, other members of the Anunnaki community, willautomatically transmit, the explanation needed. This is quite similar to anonline technical support on earth, but it is much more efficient since itfunctions brain-to-brain.Worth mentioning here, that each Anunnaki community has the same kind of centerfor these Akashic files.The complexity of the centers, though, is not the same. Some of the AkashicLibraries include more perplexing and complicated instruments and tools, whichare not readily available to other communities.These tools include the Monitor, which i s also called Mirror, or Miraya. EachMiraya is under the direct control of a Sinhar, who serves as custodian andguardian. > • 5 -The screens can expand according to the number of codes that the Anunnaki> researcher is using. Seven to ten codes are normal. If a larger number of> codes are opened, the screen is fragmented into seven different screens. An> amazing phenomenon occurs at this moment – time and space mingle together and> become unified into one great continuum. This enables the researcher to grasp> all the information in a fraction of a second.> • 6 -An added convenient aspect of the Akashic files is the ability of the> researchers to access them in the complete privacy of their homes or offices,> since part the files can be teleported there. But since the private screen is> not as complicated as the central one in the Library, no multiple screen will> open up, only the original one. Yes, Anunnaki do live in homes, and contribute> to their societies as we do on Earth.> • 7 -It is important to understand that the data received is not merely> visual. There is much more to it than that.> • 8 -By the right side of the screen, where the global data is displayed in> files, there are metallic compartments, as thin as parchment paper, which> serve as a cosmic audio antennae. These compartments search for, and bring> back, any sound that occurred in history, in any era, in any country, and of> any magnitude of importance.> • 9 -The compilation includes all sorts of sounds, and voices of people,> entities, various civilizations, and living organisms (And life-forms from the> past and the future) in the entire cosmos.> • 10 -According to the Anunnaki, every single sound or voice is never lost in> the universe. Of course, it may not traverse certain boundaries. For humans,> if a sound was produced on earth, such a boundary is the perimeter of the> solar system. Each of these antennae-compartments will probe different> galaxies and star systems, listening, recording, retrieving, and playing back> sounds, voices, and all sorts of frequencies.> • 11 -A combined asset of the visual and audio systems is the ability to learn> languages that is afforded by the Akashic Library. This applies to any> language – past, present or future, and from any part of the universe.> • 12 -The researcher can call up a shining globe of light that will swirl on> the screen with enormous speed. As it rotates, the effect blends with an audio> transmission that comes from the metallic compartments, and in an instant, any> language will sink into the brain cells.> • 13 -On the left side of the main screen, there are several conic> compartments that bring still images pertaining to certain important past> events. This display informs the researcher that these particular events> cannot be altered. In other words, the Anunnaki cannot go back into the past> and change it.> • 14 -The Anunnaki are forbidden to change or alter the events, or even just> parts or segments of the past events projected on the main screen that came> from the conic compartment, if the data (Images; sounds) represents events> created by the Anunnaki leaders.> • 15 -This restriction (Altering, changing or erasing past events) which is> applicable everywhere on Ashtari functions as a security device.> For example, a young Anunnaki cannot visit earth sixty five thousand years> ago, recreate and enter the genetic laboratory of the Anunnaki in Sumer,> Arwad, Ugarit or Phoenicia, and change the DNA and the genetic formula of a> human race, especially when the DNA sequence was originally created by an> Anunnaki Sinhar (Leader). In other words, a young Anunnaki is not allowed to> alter the Akashic Records that contain the primordial events. Alteration such> as recreating a new human race in past time will never happen.> 16 -However, an Anunnaki leader such as Sinhar Baal Shamroot, Inanna, Ellil or> Enki can go back in time and space, and change events, but cannot bring to> Earth new human species created according to a new formula that contradicts or> reverses the primordial prototypes created 100,000 years ago.> • 1 7 -However, an Anunnaki leader such as Sinhar Baal Shamroot, Inanna or> Enki can go back in time and change events, but cannot bring to Earth new> human species created according to their new formula and based on the> primordial prototypes created 100,000 years ago. Nevertheless, they can> transpose their new creation or event alteration, and transport them to> another dimension, parallel to the original dimension where the event> occurred.> • 1 8 -This safeguard means that Sinhar Inanna cannot recreate a new race on> our earth by the device of sending the current living humans back in time,> remolding us, and then bringing us back to the twenty first century as a new> species.> • 19 -This is not allowed by the Anunnaki High Council. All she can do is> recreate her own experiment in another dimension.> • 20 -Worth mentioning here, that alternation of the fabric of time and space> is rigidly and constantly monitored by the Anunnaki High Council via their> Miraya; the cosmic mirror and monitor of all living-forms, past, present, and> future.> • 21 -The Miraya is a terrific and mind-bending tool. The Anunnaki use it to> revisit time and what is beyond time, space, meta-space, and para-space, as> well as creating new cosmic calendar.> • 2 2 -More options are available for research, and one of them is a sort of> browsing. Inside the screen, there is a slit where the mind of the Anunnaki> can enter as a beam. This will open the Ba’abs, or Stargates, to other worlds> that the researcher is not even aware of; they appear randomly as part of the> discovery or exploration.> • 2 3 -In each slit, there is another Akashic file that belongs to another> civilization.> • 24 -Sometimes, these civilizations are more advanced than the Anunnaki> themselves, where the researcher can retrieve important information. It is> like going back in the future, because everything present, or to occur in the> future, has already occurred in a distant past (Timetable)> and needed the right time to surface and appear before the current living> Anunnaki.> • 2 5 -There is also the aspect of simply having fun, some of which is not so> ethical. Sometimes an Anunnaki will go back in time, let’s say 400 C.E.,> choose a famous historical figure, and at the same time bring over another> important person, one thousand years older, simply to see how they would> interact.> • 26 -They can easily deceive these personages, since every Anunnaki is an> adept at shape changing. Or they can transpose people, move them in time, and> see how they will react to the new environment.> • 2 7 -These games are strictly forbidden, but some low class Anunnaki> occasionally try it as a game. Sometimes they interfere with our daily> affairs, and temporary loss of memory may be a result of that.> • 28 -Worth reminding the readers, that the Anunnaki no longer interfere in> human affairs. They have left planet Earth for good, but they are coming back> in 2022.> • 2 9 -The Miraya is constantly used by the Anunnaki on Ashatari. In addition> to its function as a cosmic calendar, the Miraya serves as a galactic monitor.> Watching and monitoring other extraterrestrial civilizations are two of the> major concerns of the Anunnaki. For the past 10 years (In our terrestrial> time), the Anunnaki have been following very closely what was/is happening on> other planets and stars, and particularly the experiments of the Greys. Sinhar> Ambar Anati known to us as Victoria told us a lot about this. In the Book> “Anunnaki Ultimatum: End of Time” (Co-authored by Ilil Arbel and Maximillien> de Lafayette), Ambar Anati described at length some of the horrible genetic> experiments of the Greys as caught on the Miraya. Note: Ambar Anati is talking to Sinhar Inannaschamra, her mother-in-law inAshatari, about the malicious intentions of the Greys. Inannaschamra told herthat the Greys constantly conduct genetic experiments on humans, and that theAnunnaki kept on watching their atrocious experiments by using the Miraya(Monitor). Here are some excerpts from the book: “ What do they want from us onearth?”“There are a few things that they want. First, they want eggs from human womenand use them to create hybrids. Let’s take a look at this monitor, and I’ll showyou how they do that. But Victoria, steel yourself. This is pretty horrible,even though I have seen even worse. You will also be able to hear, it is like atelevision.”The monitor blinked and buzzed, and a small white dot appeared on the screen.It enlarged itself, moved back and forth, and settled into a window-like view ofa huge room, but the view was still rather fuzzy. I heard horrendous screams andfroze in my seat, these were sounds I have never heard before. After a fewminutes the view cleared and I saw what seemed to be a hospital room, but it wasrounded, not square. Only part of it was revealed, as it was elongated and thefar edge was not visible. The walls on the side were moving back and forth, likesome kind of a balloon that was being inflated and deflated periodically, with amotion that made me dizzy; they seemed sticky, even gooey. The room was full ofoperation tables, of which I could see perhaps forty or fifty, on which werestretched human beings, each attached to the table and unable to move, butobviously not sedated, since they were screaming or moaning. Everyone wasattached to long tubes, into which blood was pouring in huge quantities.I noticed that some of the blood was turning into a filthy green color, likerotting vegetation. At the time I could not understand what that was, but laterthat day I found out. This blood was converted to a suitable type for some ofthe aliens that paid the Grays to collect it, and it was not useful in its rawcondition.People who operated these experiments were small and gray, and they had big bugeyes and pointy faces without any expression. I thought they looked more likeinsects than like a humanoid species. They wore no clothes, and their skin wasshiny and moist, like that of an amphibian on earth. It visibly exuded beads ofmoisture which they did not bother to wipe away.Each operating table had complicated machinery that was poised right on top ofthe person who was strapped to it.On some of the tables, the machinery was lowered so that needles could beextracted from them automatically, and the needles reached every part of thehuman bodies, faces, eyes, ears, genitals, stomach. The people screamed as theysaw the needles approaching them, some of them fainted. Many of the people werealready dead, I could swear to that. Others were still alive but barely so, andsome had arms and legs amputated from their bodies.It was clear that once the experiment was over, every single person there willdie. I don’t know how I could continue to look, but somehow I managed. I lookedat the ceiling of this slaughter house and saw meat hooks, on which arms andlegs and even heads were hanging, like a butcher’s warehouse. On the side of thetables were large glass tanks where some organs were placed, possibly hearts,livers, or lungs, all preserved in liquids.The workers seemed to be doing their job dispassionately and without anyfeelings, moving around like ants and making buzzing sounds at each other asthey conversed. They were entirely business-like and devoid of emotion. Atleast, their huge bug eyes did not convey any emotion to me, neither did theirexpressionless faces.I watched until I could no longer tolerate it, and finally covered my eyes andcried out, “Why don’t you stop it? Why don’t you interfere?” SinharInannaschamra turned the monitor off. “This event is a record from decades ago,Victoria.It is not happening now as we look. And even though often we do interfere, wecannot police the entire universe or even the entire earth.They know how to hide from us. And you must understand, that often the victimscooperate with their abductors.”“Why would they?”“Basically, through mind control. The Grays have many ways to convince thevictims. The Grays can enter the human mind quite easily, and they find what theabductees are feeling and thinking about various subjects. Then, they can eitherthreaten them by various means, or persuade them by a promise of reward.”“Reward? What can they possibly offer?”“Well, you see, they show the victims images through a monitor, just like thisone. They tell them that they can send them through a gate, which is controlledby the monitor, to any number of universes, both physical and non-physical. Thatis where the reward come in. For example, if the abductees had originallyreacted well to images of Mary or Jesus, the Grays can promise them the joy ofthe non-physical dimensions. They show them images of a place where Mary andJesus reside, where all the saints or favorite prophets live, and even the abodeof God. They promise the abductees that if they cooperate, they could live inthis non-physical universe in perpetual happiness with their deities. Many fallfor that.”“And if they resist?”“Then they show them the non-physical alternative, which is Hell. Would you liketo see some of it?”“You can show me Hell?” I asked, amazed.“No, there is no such thing as Hell… it’s a myth that religions often exploited.But I can show you what the Grays show the abductees, pretending it is hell;they are quite devious, you know. You see, some creatures live in differentdimensions, where our laws do not apply. Sometimes, they escape to otherdimensions. These beings have no substance in their new dimensions, and theyneed some kind of bodies to function. At the same time, the Grays can tap intonumerous universes, because they can control their own molecules to make themmove and navigate through any dimension. Well, a cosmic trade had beendeveloped.The Greys supply the substance taken from human abductees, and from the blood ofcattle. You must have heard of cattle mutilation, where carcasses of cows arefound in the fields, entirely drained of blood? The Grays do it for theircustomers.”“How do these creatures pay the Grays?”“By various services, and once they get their substance, they are incrediblypowerful in a physical sense. The old tales of genies who can lift buildings andfly with them through the air were based on these demons; the Greys often have ause for such services. But let me show you a few of these creatures. Of course,you can only see them when they have already acquired some substance from theGrays.” The monitor hummed again as Sinhar Inannaschamra turned it on. The whitedot expanded into its window, which now, for some reason, was larger and tookover the entire screen.All I could see was white fog with swirls floating through it. Sometimes the fogchanged from white to gray, then to white again.I started hearing moans. Not screams, nothing that suggested the kind ofphysical pain I saw before, but perhaps just as horrible, since they voiceswhere those of hopelessness, despair, and emotional anguish. Every so often Iheard a sound that suggested a banshee’s wail, or keen, as described in Irishfolklore.“It will take a while for someone to show up,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Mostof them have no substance, and therefore they are invisible. Others have ashadowy substance. Then, there are the others…but you will see in a minute. Oncethey notice they are being watched, they will flock to the area, since they aredesperate to get out. Incidentally, it was never made quite clear to me how theyproduce sounds without bodies, we are still trying to find out what themechanics are, but it’s not easy, because we would rather not go there inperson.”“They sound horribly sad,” I said.“This is what makes it so hell-like.In many cultures, Hell never had any fire and brimstone and tormenting devils,but rather, it was a place of acute loneliness, lack of substance, andalienation from anything that could sustain the individual from a spiritualpoint of view. Think of the Greek Hades, or the ancient Hebrew Sheol, before theJews made their Hell more like the Christian one. Look, here comes the firstcreature. Poor thing, he is a shadow.”I saw a vaguely humanoid shape in deep gray. It seemed to have arms, which itwaved in our direction. It seemed fully aware of the monitor. Then anothershadow, then another, all shoving each other and waving desperately at themonitor.Then something more substantial came into view, and I jumped back as if it couldreach me. It seemed to be a severed arm. Cautiously, I came back, and then sawthat the arm was attached to a shadow body. I looked at Sinhar Inannaschamra,speechless, and she said, “Yes, here you see one that managed to receive an arm.It wants to complete its body, of course, so that it can get out of thisdimension and serve the Grays, but the Grays keep them waiting until they wantthem. In summary, the Miraya has multiple functions, and remains one of the mostimportant inventions of the Anunnaki. Gubada-Ari: How to find the healthiest spots and luckiest areas on earth Question 7:The Gubada-ri technique included this intro: “There are lines of energy spinningaround the world. In this exercise, we will concentrate on the lines that arerevealed by the use of the triangle.The energy flows in currents, both negative and positive, mostly underground,traversing the globe. Those who live above the positive lines, will have goodhealth, success, and peace of mind. Those who live above the negative lines,will have bad health. The student might ask, where do I put the triangle? How doI choose the original location? The answer is, you put the triangle wherever youare.The student might ask, what if I change locations? The answer is, this techniqueis working within the dictates of the moment. Wherever you are, the trianglefollows.”My questions are: How do I know I live above negative currents?What should I do to change these bad currents affecting my life?Are there bad lines everywhere in the world? Answer to question 7:How would you know that you live above negative currents?You should be the one, the only one (In many instances) to know you are livingabove negative lines, by assessing your status quo. If you see that you arefailing in many of the things you are doing, despite good planning, commonsense, hard work and reasonable approach to what you do, then you should realizethat something is wrong.If your health condition is constantly deteriorating with no apparent reasons,or justified symptoms despite intensive health care, a good nutritional system,a good diet, medical attention, regular check ups, and a healthy living, thenyou should ask yourself why your health is deteriorating. You have here morethan one red flag! Keep watching those unpleasant occurrences very closely,monitor your activities, maintain a meticulous records of what you do on a dailybasis, and write down in details what you are going through in relation todates, days and hours, and especially where usually you move around. If thesemishaps accumulate at an amazing rate without a logical explanation, then usealternative means/analyses to understand the reasons, the mechanism and thecontinuous avalanches of disastrous events.Coincidences do happen. But when many bad coincidences don’t cease and appear onall fronts, and in all what you do, including health, then you have to dosomething about it. Some people consult experts in the fields, therapists,experienced consultants, and talk to others who went through similar events. Ifall these approaches do not work, then you have to realize that you are not incontrol of these events and mysterious incidents.You will know when so many things on many fronts and in many areas are gettingnasty, worse or threatening. What should you do to change these bad currentsaffecting your life?There is nothing you can do to change these lines because you are not strongerthan Mother Nature. Consult professionals in the field, physicians and nutritionexperts as far as your health is concerned. Business planning consultants andfinancial advisors when it comes to your business and finances, so on.But if nothing works, and you know you have tried everything, then one optionand only one option is left: Change location, move, live or work somewhere else.But where? This is another question (You have not asked, though)! Try to thefind the answer by learn and practicing the Gubada-ri technique. See if it worksfor you. It could work for you, because it worked for so many people I know.My advice to you is this:> • 1 -Don’t rush to change location.> • 2 -Stay where you are for a while, especially if you own the place where you> live or work.> • 3 -Now that you have realized that something quite strange is constantly> happening in your life, and you have no means to stop it or a way to explain> it, is already a good step.So, keep your place for a while, but move temporarily somewhere else, and see ifthings change to better. If they do, and all of a sudden, you start to feel muchbetter, and you have no more problems, then you will know that you wereliving/working in an area infested by bad vibrations and doomed by negativecurrents.This should work. The Double and the Baridu Technique QUESTION 8 :REGARDING THE BARIDU TECHNIQUE… YOU SAID THAT “ONCE YOU ENTER YOUR DOUBLE, YOUWILL BE ABLE TO USE IT IN SO MANY BEAUTIFUL AND EFFECTIVE WAYS AS:> 7. A protective shield against danger,> 8. An effective apparatus to protect yourself in hostile and dangerous> situations,> 9. A tool to develop your abilities to learn many languages, and enhance your> artistic creativity”My questions are: How a non-physical entity that does not live on Earth canprotect me from physical threats?If this is true, then the President of the United States and the Secretary ofState should get rid of their bodyguards and hire a Double? It does not makesense!Is it really possible to learn a new language just by zooming into our Double?If this is possible, why then secret agencies and espionage or counter-espionageagencies don’t use this technique to teach their agents all the languages in theworld?Why they keep on buying all these foreign languages dictionaries and foreignlanguages learning lessons on tapes and CDs? Answer to question 8:Protection against threats and dangers: First of all, you have to remember thatpeople of power, politicians, et al , are neither spiritual people, nor adeptsof metaphysical studies. They spend more time campaigning, shaking hands, andgiving speeches than developing spiritual and paranormal abilities.So bodyguards remain a necessity. They should stay around.Only those who have learned and developed esoteric Ulema techniques can usetheir Double as a shield. However, a novice or a sincere student who issearching for the ultimate paranormal truth, and who has revealed a highstandard of spirituality and goodness will be able to use the Double, oncehe/she has completed the Ulema studies. At your stage, your Double is alive andwell, and is fully aware of your existence, but YOU are not aware of itsexistence, because either you do not believe in a Double, or you have notestablished a rapport with your Double.Once, a rapport has been established with your Double, your Conduit will throwan invisible protective shield around you. Is it a physical barrage?A protective tool or a device similar to the fibreglass or a metal shield policeuse in riots? The answer is no.The shield functions in so many different ways your brain cannot comprehend.However, I will try to explain to you one of the protective measures a shielduses in threatening situations.The Ulema after years of study and practice, and following the in structions ofthe Book of Ramadosh, became capable of creating a sphere (Or zone) around themthat resembles a halo. Some call this halo a “Bubble”. The halo surrounds theirphysical body. In the halo, exist molecules and particles charged with highatomic and sub-atomic density (No, not nuclear devices!), i.e. energy. Thisenergy is denser in its composition than any of the molecules and particles thatphysically create and constitute any physical action or movement against anUlema’s body.Ulema’s energy changes constantly and transmutes itself into higher or lowermolecules/particles density, according to their surroundings and needs.Because of the Ulema’s denser atomic substance, nothing can penetrate the halosurrounding them. You have to remember, that everything in the universe iscomposed from molecules and particles. For instance, if you throw a punch at anUlema, you put in your punch a certain amount of energy and physical effort. Theenergy and the physical effort are composed from molecules. These molecules aredenser in their composition than the molecules floating around the Ulema, andthus cannot penetrate their halo and reach their bodies.This is why people can’t go through walls. Our bodies molecules need “to shrink”and “transmute” themselves into thinner vibrations, to allow us to go throughwalls. Secondly, the non-physical entity (Double) you have mentioned is nottotally non-physical. It changes. It materializes and dematerializes.The Double can project itself as a physical entity.And it takes on multiple appearances ranging from holographic tomulti-dimensional presences.However, the materialistic apparition does not last very long in athree-dimensional sphere, because its bio-etcoplasma energy is consumed rapidly.Let’s forget for a moment this complicated language, and explore an easiercharacteristic aspect of the Double, its halo, zone and protective shield. Iwill try to use a simple language, as much as I can. Disregard everything I havesaid before, and follow me now step by step.> • a -Your Double is extremely intelligent and alert, and it senses things> around you. Things currently happening and those en route.> • b -Your Double knows right away if what is coming at you is safe or> dangerous.> • c -If the Double detects a threatening situation, it sends an alert to your> Conduit.> • d -Your Conduit receives the message from your Double. (Note: Sometimes, it> is simultaneously, and/or your Open Conduit understands the situation on its> own, without the help of your Double.)> • e -Your Conduit acts on its own and guides you instantly to a safer> position. Call it whatever you want, instinct, an inner feeling, etc…it does> not matter what you call it.> • f -At the same time, your Conduit emits vibes aimed at the source of the> threat to bock it.> • g -At this very moment, your Open Conduit and your Double act in unison.> • h -In a fraction of a second, the attacker or the negative vibes aimed at> you is diverted. Nothing can penetrate the halo around you. If you practice> and master the Baridu technique, you will be able to block any threat. As to your question: “Is it really possible to learn a new language just byzooming into our Double?” The answer is YES! However, what you will learnbecomes a memory, a sort of a depot of knowledge not activated or accessible byyour brain. This happens at the preliminary stage. Later on, when you revisityour Conduit, you will be able to tap into that depot, work mentally with thelanguage you have just learned, and practice physically by writing down on apaper the words and phraseology from that language.There is a process to follow that allows you to remember that language and bringit out of your Conduit cell.> Daemat-Afnah Question 9:You said the Daemat-Afnah technique keeps us young and makes us look 37permanently. It is difficult to understand this. I am 54, if I practice thistechnique for a while, would I look again 37 years old? What would happen to theface I had before? Does it come back? For how long I would stay 37? Answer to question 9:You have to practice the technique for at least one full year. You will not seeany improvement or any result before 12 months. I will explain to you what isgoing to happen step by step.> • For the first 6 months. You will not notice any change on your face.> • At the end of the seventh month, you will begin to feel that some of your> facial muscles are getting stronger. A strange and a new sensation you have> never felt before in your whole life.> • Your face will look cleaner and firmer.> • Some of the wrinkles under your eyes will disappear. In rare instances, they> would not.> • Not all the wrinkles will disappear if you stop practicing.> • At the end of 12 months, you will notice that you eyes have gained vitality.> They will look sharper.> • Your eyes will glitter with a sign of good health.> • At the end of 12 months, you will notice that your face’s skin is healthier,> and almost 90% of your wrinkles (large and small) have diminished.> • The dermatologic results have no side effect.> • A certain incomprehensible inner strength will energize your whole body.> • After 13 months of practice, the face you had when you were 37 starts to> reappear gradually. You will not believe what you are seeing.> • This change is usually accompanied by sizeable increase in physical dynamism> and mental vitality.> • Your face is younger, almost 100%.> • Only your face gets younger, not your neck, body or any other part of your> body.> • Your grey hair will stay grey.> • If you are bold, you will stay bold.> • You will keep your new face for a very very long time, as long as you keep a> good diet, and you eat well.> > *** *** ***> Important note:> > > • Bear in mind that the Ulema’s teachings, techniques, and/or opinions should> not be considered as a professional advice, prescription, or opinion at any> level – therapeutic, medical, cosmetic, surgical, health wise, etc.> • They are of a purely philosophical-esoteric nature.> • This technique does not substitute for any other medical treatment.> • This technique is not dangerous or harmful.> • It could be very beneficial at many levels, even though, it is not proven> scientifically.> • However, many who have practiced this technique were delighted by the> results.> > Bukadari Technique Question 10:You said: “People can also send harmful vibrations to your mind, to your body,and to the objects you touch, including tools, materials, equipments you use,such as a computer, a camera, a car, an elevator, a desk, even a can-opener.”Does this mean that people’s negative vibrations can screw up my computer? Dothey have to be around me, or they could still do it at distance? Are youtalking about sick people, malicious people or all people? Answer to question 10:Most certainly, people’s negative vibrations can screw up your computer, andmany of your electrical gadgets.The bitter negativity of some people affects even the battery and starter ofyour car. You car will not start. Some people have green thumb, others have greythumbs. Some people emanate healthy and positive vibes that bring comfort andjoy to others, and some people diffuse negative vibes that affect the harmony,balance and serenity around them and around others.You asked: “Do they have to be around me, or they could still do it atdistance?” Basically, they have to be at a close proximity. If they are aroundyou, you will feel it. But to be certain that indeed they are causing youdiscomfort or disturbing your tools, you must observe what is happening, see ifthese unusual sensations you are felt when they were around you, and thenuisances or damage to your tool are reoccurring every time they show up or arearound.Now, do not get suspicious and anxious. Coincidences happen all the time. Youmust remain calm but alert.If your computer crashes, your telephone does not work anymore, or any of yourelectric or electronic gadgets is acting weird or stop to function, every timethey show up, then you should not be in the same room with them, or you couldstay if you have already learned the Bukadari technique and know how to use it.There are some bizarre situations, where and when you got hit by negatives vibescaused by your own action, and thoughts.For instance, while you were fixing something or typing on your computerkeyboard, and all of a sudden, out of the blue, you think about a person youdislike so much, because he/he caused you some troubles or hurt you in the past,and suddenly the light bulb explodes, or the computer stops to work. This couldhappen.Perhaps something wrong with the bulb itself, or there is faulty electricalwiring, maybe your computer was attacked by a virus and just died on you at thispeculiar moment.You will never know and understand what is causing all these strangeoccurrences, until:a -You start to take notice,b-Keep meticulous records of all these events,c-And find the relation between what you were doing or thinking and what justhappened during these particular moments.In this case, your brain has caused those unpleasant incidents. If your Conduitis open, you will discover right away the cause and source of these strangeevents. If you Conduit is extremely active, negative vibes or unpleasantincidents will not occur frequently.Negative vibes are not necessarily produced by sick or malicious people. In manyinstances, the vibrations emanate from people who really care about you.Unfortunately, they don’t know that their unhappy state of mind, fear, anxiety,dissatisfaction from their jobs, bitterness, and their negative attitude towardlife are producing such negative and destructive vibes.Be considerate, polite, and understanding.Quietly remove yourself from their presence. Use courtesy and civility.Arawadi Technique and the Afterlife Question 11:Ulema Lambrakis said: “All of us live in two separate dimensions so close to us.One we know and we call it our physical reality, the other is the adjacentdimension that surrounds our physical world.” Is he talking about the after-lifedimension? Can I visit this dimension? I read in a few books written by Indiangurus that life after death exists in a dimension adjacent to the one we livein. Are we talking here about the same dimension? If not, what is the differencebetween the two? Answer to question 11:The adjacent dimension that surrounds our physical world could mean many things.For example, there is a dimension which is not located in the world of theafter-life, because it is accessible to living human beings who wish to visitit. They are still alive, live a normal life on Earth, and through sometechniques can visit that dimension and return safe to Earth. Their visit couldtake on many different shapes and forms, and be done via a multitude of means.It could be psychosomatic, purely mental, visual, holographic, teleported,transposed, spiritual and purely physical.Essentially, what Ulema Lambrakis was referring to is no more or less than thedimension or zone that exists in a parallel world. Modern quantum physicstheorists wrote extensively on this subject, and most particularly on paralleldimensions, multiple universes, future worlds, world from the future and beyond.And these scientists refer to Ulema Lambrakis’ dimension. So, the answer is no.Ulema Lambrakis is not talking about the dimension of the after-life. You asked:“Can I visit this dimension? If you are asking about the after-life dimension, Idon’t think you want to go there yet. You go there and you will never come back.Dead people don’t come back.You told me that you have read in a few books written by Indian gurus that lifeafter death exists in a dimension adjacent to the one we live in, and asked:“Are we talking here about the same dimension?” My answer is no. It is quitedifferent.As to your final question: “If not, what is the difference between the two?” isthis: It would take a whole book to explain all the differences. *** *** ***The Mind, the Supersymetric Mind and the Conduit Equation___________________ In volume one, I told you briefly about the Mind, Fikr, the Supersymetric Mind,and their relationship to the Conduit.However, I did not elaborate enough on this subject. And I do feel thatadditional explanation is needed, mainly because I will be talking to you aboutthe activation of the Conduit and the levels of Iama. The Anunnaki Ulema Conduit is a new concept to readers in the WesternHemisphere. No other book has ever explained its enigmatic mechanism andpurposes.The Conduit is a cell that contains all knowledge known to Man, on Earth and inother dimensions.Mainstream science has yet to define its properties, and locate its perimeter inthe brains. Some scholars have compared the Conduit to the “Third Eye”.When I brought this concept to the West, I stated clearly that the Conduit is acosmic memory and a depot of all the knowledge known to human beings. Onceactivated, it would produce extraordinary deeds, and elevates us to the highestlevel of awareness, and intelligence. In this section of the book, I willexplain to you how to activate your Conduit. Who created the Supersymetric Mind?At the time, the Anunnaki fashioned our human body, they did not install in ourbody a fully functional brain. They created us to serve their needs. Some earlyhuman or quasi-human species were upgraded; others remained at a bestial level,despite all the efforts of the Anunnaki gods and goddesses.The Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets are clear on the subject.Note: Please refer to my book “Anunnaki Genetic Creation of the Human Races,Demons and Spirits.” *** *** ***The Anunnaki’s intention was to create a robust race, capable of working thefields, and executing hard physical labor and duties. Thus, an intelligent mindwas not necessary.We were created as laborers and slaves.You might not like the idea, or even refute this argument, but if you read theAkkadian/Sumerian texts, you will find out that the early humans wereintentionally created by the Anunnaki goddesses and gods to feed them, and “fillthe basket”, meaning, to bring them food.According to the Ulema, the Anunnaki were not the first to experiment with andon humans.Some 445,000 years ago, a different race called the Igigi, were the firstextraterrestrials to create quasi-human specimens.At the very beginning of their genetic experiments, the results werecatastrophic.The Igigi’s creations of the first race of humans looked awful – bestial, veryugly, even frightening. This happened because the Igigi were more terrestrialexplorers than geneticists, and they were more interested in certain moleculesfound in terrestrial water, and in various minerals on Earth, than in creating aperfectly shaped human race.At one point in time, the Igigi were ferocious toward the early quasi-humanbeings, and treated them very badly, since they considered the early version ofhuman beings on Earth as a lower working class without intelligence.Incidentally, the Earth was extremely cold at that time, and the Igigi had tocover the human bodies with lots of hair to protect them from the elements.It took the quasi-human race thousands of years to evolve into an early humanform, and even then, they were not totally human, looking more like apes. Theyhad a very robust body, but lacked intelligence. Some of them had bizarre skullsand facial bones, and their brain was not wired to function as an intelligentprocessor of data, information, and analytic comprehension.Bear in mind, that the Igigi were highly advanced in mineralogy and mineralstransmutation. The Anunnaki were geneticists and engineers with a strongappreciation for esthetics. Therefore, the Igigi created a very primitive formof living beings on Earth, exactly as we, modern humans, created veryunappealing early forms and shapes of robots and related mechanical devices atthe dawn of robotics.These robotic-quasi humans were functional but not pretty to look at, and theearly quasi-humans were not much more than biological machines with limitedmental faculties.In the genes, molecules and DNA of the early quasi-human race, the Igigiprogrammed thirteen faculties (mental functions), according to “Ilmu Al Donia”.A group of early Allamah stated that the thirteen faculties were implanted inthe human brain by the Anunnaki. The Akkadian texts are silent on the subject.The most important abilities were as follows: > • a -The ability to move;> • b -The ability to sense danger;> • c -The ability to understand by association;> • d -The ability to memorize;> • e -The ability to see forms and shapes in four colors. These colors were:> • 1 -Bright yellow, representing gold;> • 2 -Grey, representing minerals and rocks;> • 3 -Blue, representing the atmosphere, air, and water;> • 4 -A very strong red, representing heat and blood. Other colors such as green, purple, lilac, etc, were not visible or known to theearly and primitive form of quasi-humans. The Akkadian text on the creation:“Once you have finished mixing thethe Apsu's fathering clay,Imma-en and Imma-Shar will makethe fetus bigger,after you have placed the limbs upon it.”Enki then gives additional instruction to goddess Ninmah, who is the mothergoddess, and to eight Anunnaki goddesses.He said:“O mother, once, you are done with molding the being,let Ninmah join together the chair of birth,without any male semen, and then,you give birth to mankind.Without the sperm of malesshe will give birth to their offspring,and to the embryo of mankind.And once Nammu had enlarged its shoulders,she will make a hole in the head to put a mouth. Note: The following line is damaged. and then, she will wrap its body in an amnion.” Note: The tablets tell us that Enki and Ninmah got drunk, and consequently, theycreated crippled beings; they were both physically and mentally deformed. Enkithen decided to create a creature on his own. The Epic tells us that thiscreature (Quasi-Human) is terribly deformed.Ninmah says:“The man, you createdis neither a live man,nor a dead man,I can not support it!” The Akkadian clay tablets tell us that the creation of the first Man requiredthe participation of at least twelve Anunnaki goddesses. They had to mix up the\"fathering clay\" of the Apsu, which is the underground fresh water.Ulema Mordachai stated that the clay the Anunnaki goddesses have used, had veryparticular properties that produced life, once joined with a woman's womb. Theclay was later placed over the fetus and fashioned into the form of man.Once done, the Anunnaki goddesses added limbs and a mouth. To complete thegenetic creation of Man, Ninmah placed the clay into her womb.Nammu is the Anunnaki goddess who gave Enki the idea of creating humankind toreplace the Igigi, who worked the fields.Enki begins to think about the creation process, and how to use the clay andwater of the abyss, to create human beings.He told Nammu to bring Anunnaki womb-goddesses to mix the clay and to call uponAnunnaki fashioners (Term used to refer to Anunnaki goddesses who designed thebody of the first Man) to thicken it, so she could mold the wet clay into theshape of a human body. Then, he instructed her to bring the limbs to life, inthe image of the gods.She will give birth to the embryo of mankind without using the sperm of a male.The new being shall be called Adamah.And a creature was created."},{"pageContent":" [Image00009.gif]  Sumerian Tablet of the Creation of the World, Babylonia 1900-1700 B.C. ___________________________________ Then, the gods and goddesses decided to have a feast to celebrate their newcreation, and Enki and Ninmah began to drink beer and got drunk.Consequently, the being they created was a deformed creature. And Ninmahcontinued to fashion handicapped people.Her creations were:> • a -A weak person who was unable to control his urine,> • b -A barren woman,> • c -A being without organs, etc. Finally she realized that she was unable to create a perfect Man. She throwsdown the clay in despair. Then Enki decided to create a man by himself, but hefailed, for the creature he fashioned died as soon as he was born. The Sumerian-Anunnaki goddess Nammu/“Namma” and her son Enki created multiple forms ofhumans, sometimes using clay, and other times using blood of warriors theyslaughtered.In the Sumerian myths, she was the primordial mother goddess, and creator of thegods. She was also called “The pure goddess”, and was associated with freshwater. Nammu is the mother of the Anunnaki god Enki, and the Anunnaki goddessEreshkigal, the goddess of the Kurnugi (The underworld).The Akkadian/Sumerian texts describe her as “The mother who gave birth toheaven, earth, and the gods of the universe, and the mother of everything.” Excerpts from Ulema’s Kira’at (Reading):Mankind was not created by one single Sumerian god. More than one Anunnakiparticipated in the creation of mankind.And contrary to common belief, the Anunnaki were not the first extraterrestrialsand gods to create a human from clay.Many other deities from different pantheons also created man from clay. Forinstance, Khnum “Kneph” (Meaning: To build, to unify in Egyptian) was one of theoldest Egyptian gods, who created mankind from clay on a potter's wheel. Khnumbecame a variation of Ptah. The Anunnaki first landed in Phoenicia, where theyestablished their first colonies, and shortly thereafter, they created theirmost elaborate medical center on the Island of Arwad, which at the time was aPhoenician territory.However, the Anunnaki ameliorated their genetic creations, and upgraded earlyhuman forms and primitive humans in their laboratories in Sumer. [Image00010.gif] The goddess Inanna, also known as Innin, and Innini.______________________________ The Sumerian texts and their translations into western languages gave moreexposure to the Anunnaki of Sumer, than to the other equally powerful Anunnakiof Phoenicia and Central Africa.The Sumerian texts include various versions of the creation of mankind by amultitude of Anunnaki gods and goddesses.[Image00011.jpg] Goddess Nammu, also known as Namma, the Sumerian goddess of Creation.Here, she is shown in the center of the slab, stepping over a lion, todemonstrate her supreme authority. Some passages in the Sumerian texts refer to different creators, as well as tomultiple genetic experiments.There is no reference to one singular genetic creation of the early human races,or solid certainty to the fact that mankind was genetically created by onesingle god. In fact, a multitude of gods and goddesses created different typesand categories of human beings, to name a few: > • Ninlil,> • Ninhursag, quite often referred to as Ninlil,> • Marduk,> • Inanna, the Anunnaki goddess who created the first prototypes of Man.> • Enki,> • Imma-Shar,> • Ekimu,> • Gibbori,> • Ferohim,> • Anu,> • Aruru,> • Enlil, etc. The Akkadian/Sumerian texts revealed to us that the early humans did not have anintelligent brain. They were robots. But thousands of years later (Around, 6,000or 7,000 B.C.), the Anunnaki reprogrammed our brain, and installed additionalmental faculties. But this addition did not include a “Conduit”. Nevertheless,the new human brain was upgraded, and a Supersymetric Mind came to life.Regardless of the level of intelligence and awareness, each one of us has, had,or will have in the future, the supersymetric mind exists as a necessarycompanion and guide for our physical mind. In conclusion, it is safe to arguethat the Anunnaki created our Supersymetric Mind, thousands of years, after thecreation of the earliest prototypes of the human species.

How to develop your Supersymetric Mind? I. Definition and introduction:Iama is a term referring to the concept of the different “Levels of the Mind”.According to many authors and thinkers, the human brain is a depot of allknowledge we have acquired so far.This is not totally correct, according to the Book of Ramadosh. UlemaOppenheimer said verbatim, as is and unedited:“The physical brain, or in other words, the brain of a human being living hereon Earth is one of the multiple layers of an infinite series of knowledge andexperience acquired by a person in and outside the barrier of time and space.”Meaning that every single human being, regardless of the level of his or herintelligence and social status has an infinite number of other brains “Minds”fully operational in different and multiple spheres, times and spaces. And thisincludes the landscape of our Solar System, and other universes’ systems. Thisis the cause and effect of the creation of the Universe and Man. II. All humans have more than one brain:Man cannot be separated from the universe, because he is a vital and primordialpart of its molecules.In other words, a person can be very intelligent and extremely important in thislife, and in the same time, a total ignorant and unimportant in another life,and/or time-space that co-exists simultaneously somewhere else in the universe.Anunnaki Ulema Oppenheimer added, “Here on Earth you might be an amateurmusician, and in another world or dimension, you are conductor of a symphonicorchestra, or even equal to Mozart.In each dimension, and this includes stars and planets, you as a human being youlive a separate life, and you have a totally independent brain. The enlightenedmasters are fully capable of synchronizing both, and even more…” III. The four levels of the mind:The Anunnaki Ulema told us that our mind has are four levels:Level one: Tabi’a.Level two: Irtifa.Level three: Tanara.Level four: Kamala. Level one: Tabi’a.It represents the human nature at its lowest point.And it refers to dishonorable professions, deeds and humans’ lowestdesires/activities, such as, addiction to narcotics, prostitution, pimping,selling drugs, loan sharks, murderers, rapists, child abusers, injustice,viciousness, selfishness, and cruelty toward animals. Worth mentioning here,that similar to the ancient Roman Civil Code, the Anunnaki Ulema Nizam (Order)and Kanoun (Law or Principles) stripped prostitutes from their civil rights. Andconsidered those who dishonored their parents, neglected the elderly, mistreatedanimals, and caused suffering to orphans, as unworthy of mind-spirit orientationand guidance. At this level, we also find the weakness of the human body,diseases, sickness, mental anomalies, bad hygiene, and perturbed minds. Theseaspects of the human races prevent the opening of the Conduit. And as a result,the Astral Body, the Double, The Supersymetric Mind, and the equilibrium linesof Khateyn Tarika suffer enormously.The enlightened masters believe that all humans are born materialistic, violent,and immoral. Few escape the chain of cause and effect of the Anunnaki’sfashioning, design, and programming of mankind’s nature, which they call Tabi’a.At that level, the human mind is deteriorated, and the human spirit resembles astagnant pond, where bacteria spread, and insects breed. The masters comparedthe people of level one, to the trapped beings/entities in Marash Mawta (TheAfterlife Doomed Zone).The masters argued that the Taba’yim (People of the Tabi’a level) are theMalou-niim, meaning the damned. And they are Malou-niim, because their Tabi’a(Nature) is permanently damaged. Nothing can be done for these people. However,the masters recommend that we treat them –at distance– with affection anddignity, and in the same token, to avoid interacting with them. They aretroubled, and will create lots of troubles and damages to others. Level two: Irtifa.Irtifa means ascension, and liberation in Ana’kh and Ulemite. It is a good levelof the mind, because it allows us to understand what is right and what is wrong.It is a level, where the Irtifa-iim (People of the Irtifa level) progress andevolve mentally, intellectually and spiritually, and consequently, they begin tolearn how to prevent danger and threatening situations from happening, how toread mind, how to become fluent in many languages in a matter of a few weeks,how to read the Aura, how to accomplish multiple tasks in no time, how toreverse or halt bad luck, so on.Because, they are already members of the Ulema’s Jamiya (Society, circle), theirmind will elevate itself to a higher level of awareness, and eventually theIrtifa-iim will liberate themselves from all the negative influences of Tabi’a,and ascend to Tanara.Time needed to reach this level: Two years of study under the wings of theAnunnaki Ulema. Level three: Tanara.This level represents awareness, total development of supernatural powers, andthe first stage of enlightenment.Through their perfectly developed mind, the Tana-riim (People of the thirdlevel) keep their Chakra radiant and healthy, their vision clear and alert, andtheir mind-body synchronization in an excellent shape. Using the extraordinarypowers of their mind, the Tana-riim can materialize and dematerialize, enterparallel dimensions, manifest themselves physically and holographically, and tapinto the Miraya and the vast depot of knowledge and awareness of the collectivemind of the Kami-liim. Time needed to reach this level: Ten years of study underthe wings of the Anunnaki Ulema. Level four: Kamala.This level represents enlightenment, a perfect harmony with the Micro and theMacro, and the mastery of supernatural powers. It is the final stage of completeawareness, and unification/unity with the ultimate state of Oneness.Kamala means perfection, in Ana’kh and Ulemite. At this level, the mind is free,perfectly developed, and transcends the frontier of time and space. TheKami-liim (People of the fourth level) can accomplish extraordinary deeds,incomprehensible to the human mind.For instance, they never age physically, they are immune to illnesses anddiseases, they teleport themselves in a blink of an eye, they materialize anddematerialize, bend time, reverse time, bend space, reverse space, entermultiple dimensions, and foresee the future, because they are already there.Time needed to reach this level: Unknown. *** *** ***T[Image00018.gif] he Triangle of Iama. IV. How to develop your Supersymetric Mind. I. Introduction:According to Anunnaki Ulema Al-Sadik, and Master Mordachai ben Zvi, there areseveral ways and means to develop our Supersymetric Mind. The development ormore precisely the awakening techniques of the Supersymetric Mind, calledTanwiir Ilmu, requires:> • Mental discipline;> • Introspection;> • Meditation;> • Observance of a very specific diet;> • Specific mental exercises;> • Visualization techniques;> • Mind projection;> • Mind transmission, and above all,> • Compliance with the rules of Nizam and Kanoun. I know, it is getting very complicated. It would take 4 volumes to describe andexplain to you all these requirements.Besides, you would not fully benefit from the narrative and rhetoricexplanation, if you are not a member of the Jamiya. However, I can introduce youto a technique that it is widely used by adepts, and Anunnaki Ulema’s students.This technique is called Nizraat Takaroob. It is easy to follow, challenging,and fun. Basically and essentially, Nizraat Takaroob invites your mind to thinkout of the box, and stimulates a part of your brains (Mind) you never knewexisted.Why?Because it is not a physical zone in your brain. You can’t touch it. You can’tlocate it. You can’t measure it. You can’t photograph it. But it is there.This part or zone of your Mind was created some 6,000 or 7,000 years ago, whenthe Anunnaki upgraded and reprogrammed our brains. Forty years ago or so, DNAwas a quasi-scientific quest, not a reality. The same thing applies today to theSupersymetric Mind. No doubt, in the very near future, you will read lots ofscientific papers on this subject. On the following pages, you will observevarious illustrations that demonstrate how Nizraat Takaroob works. II. How to use the Nizraat Takaroob technique:Follow these instructions. Illustration #1:> Step #1. You start concentrating on this screen (Grid). And try to identify> the two different positions of the triangles.> See next page. [Image00019.gif] Illustration of the screen (Grid).Identifying the two positions of the triangles: [Image00020.gif] Step #2. Look for more triangles. And keep identifying more “Up Triangles”, and“Down Triangles”.Spend approximately 2 minutes on this exercise. This will anchor you into thegrid. Do not ask why, just do it. Step #3. Now, try to identify the “Double Triangles”; one Up, and one Down.Spend approximately 2 minutes on this exercise. [Image00021.gif] Illustration of a “Double Triangle”. Nizraat Takaroob TechniqueIllustration #1[Image00022.gif]Write on this page how many “Up Triangles”, “Down Triangles”, and “DoubleTriangles”, you have identified so far.Example:20 Up:_______________ 15 Down:_____________ 10 Double:____________ You write here: Up:_______ Down:_____ Double:____ *** *** ***Step #4: Go back to page 235. Concentrate on the left triangle (see below) forapproximately 5 seconds. [Image00023.gif] Step #7: Tell you mind that you want to bring the right triangle closer to theleft triangle. Step #8: You can do that if you concentrate on the very top of the righttriangle for ten minutes. Focus on this part of the triangle. See below: [Image00024.gif] Step #9: Look at illustration #2, on page 239. You should get the result, asseen on page 239. Mind you, if you succeed, what you see is not a hallucination,but a Mental Transposition of an object, from one place to another.With practice, patience, and perseverance, you will succeed. Do notunderestimate the power of your mind. Once this step is accomplished successfully, your Supersymetric Mind will bepartially activated. Expect to fail in your first and second attempts. Nothingwrong with that. You are entering an unchartered zone of the mind. Buteventually, you will Succeed!Illustration # 2 [Image00025.gif]Additional instruction:If you have failed more than 3 times, do this: [Image00026.gif] a-Tell your mind that the top of the triangle (Square in shade) is much lighterin weight than the base of triangle.b-Focus on the top of the triangle for 5 minutes or so.c-Command the top of the triangle to lift up and separate itself from the wholetriangle. Keep repeating this command mentally for 2 minutes.d-You are going to be amazed by the result of your deep concentration. The topwill separate itself from the whole triangle, and will come closer to the lefttriangle. It is going to happen. No doubt about it.e-As soon as the top is close to the left triangle, the whole triangle willshift itself toward the left triangle. See illustration on page 239. Step #10: Mentally command the right triangle to merge with the left triangle.See illustration on page 241. On page 242, I will explain to you how you can doit. *** *** *** Illustration # 3 [Image00027.gif]Instruction for step #10: a - Look one more time at the illustration #3 on page 241.This is how the 2 triangles merge. [Image00028.gif]Merging of the 2 triangles. b - Although, you are still using your “regular” mind, and no Supersymetric Mindhas yet manifested itself, do not be concerned with this. Don’t tell yourself,well, I am not using this Symetric thing, where is it? It is only a mind game.Don’t ever say that. Once you are fully anchored into the grid, and your mindstarts to get busy with the right triangle, the left triangle, the Up triangle,the Down triangle, moving one triangle closer to another one, once all theseactivities are progressing, and while you are still focusing (Intensely) on allthese mental exercises, your Supersymetric Mind will kick off, out of the blue.It will take over. Your “regular” mind will be pushed aside temporarily, yourmental visualization will increase considerably, and suddenly your Supersymetricmind begins to guide you in your experiment/exercise.How this is done? You will find out, later, and on your own, and no furtherexplanation is needed.Please, keep telling yourself: “I can do it! I can do it! I can do it!” You haveto believe in yourself, and in the power of your mind. Don’t give up too fastand too easy. All the students of the Anunnaki Ulema practiced the Nizraat Takaroob, and allsucceeded in activating their Supersymetric Mind. Practice makes perfect!Esoteric studies and mental development are not easy to understand, simplybecause there is no physical and realistic explanation that could make youunderstand what is happening here. If others have succeeded in these exercises,why shouldn’t you join the club? c - If the right triangle is not getting closer to the left triangle, or notclose enough, close your eyes for 5 seconds, and direct your attention to thebase of the left triangle. d - Focus on the lower base of the left triangle. See illustration below: [Image00029.gif] e -And now, fast, and back and forth, and without stopping, move your eyes fromthe base of the left triangle to the top of the right triangle, and viceversa…Don’t STOP!! Keep doing this for 10 seconds, and Voila! Both triangles aremerging now almost perfectly! It wouldn’t take more than 9 seconds!You did it. Congratulations!!See illustration #4 on page 243. *** *** ***Illustration # 4 [Image00030.gif]Step #11: Look at the illustration #5 on page 246.Now you are going to reverse the whole process. Meaning, you are going to dojust the opposite. I will explain: Look at these 2 triangles that we took from illustration #5. [Image00031.gif] 2 triangles taken from illustration #5. By now, you have partially activated your Supersymetric Mind. Your “regular”mind is dormant, and that’s wonderful. Reversing the whole process, and pushingaside the right triangle is a piece of cake. Why? Because your very powerfulSupersymetric Mind is in charge now. It is going to require a minimal effort anda very short time to accomplish this. Step #12: Tell your Supersymetric Mind to remove the right triangle from thespace it currently occupies in the left triangle. You do not have to do anythingelse. No more concentration on a triangle base, or on the top of a triangle.Your Supersymetric Mind knows what to do. It will follow your command. Andinstantly, the right triangle is separated from the left triangle. Seeillustration # 6, on page 247. *** *** ***Illustration # 5 [Image00032.gif] Illustration # 6 [Image00033.gif]Step #13 : Ask your Supersymetric Mind to move the left triangle closer to theright triangle, and merge partially with it.See illustration #7, on page 249. Step #14: Ask your Supersymetric Mind to totally merge the left triangle withthe right triangle. I mean almost totally.See illustration #8, on page 250. Step #15: Final exercise:Ask your Supersymetric Mind to separate both triangles and bring them to theirinitial position on the grid.See illustration #9, on page 251. You are done!Congratulations! *** *** *** Illustration # 7 [Image00034.gif] Illustration # 8 [Image00035.gif] Nizraat Takaroob TechniqueIllustration #9 [Image00036.gif]The benefits from mastering the Nizraat Takaroob technique___________________ What have we accomplished by mastering the Nizraat Takaroob technique?Why this mental exercise is necessary?How can we benefit from it?Well, you have to do something to trigger the Supersymetric Mind. In order to doso, you must transpose your “regular” mind to Ira’ha, which means a state ofneutrality. As long as your “regular” (Normal) mind is preoccupied with otherthings, significant or not, it can’t liberate itself from those things, andreach a higher level of awareness. Meditation is always useful, but in thiscontext, it would not help to partially activate the Supersymetric Mind.The Nizraat Takaroob technique opens the Ma bira-rach, which is the ethericimage of your brain (Mind). Once the Ma bira-rach, becomes accessible, otherimages will follow, and a wider mental perception expands. The expansion of awider mental perception frees your “regular” mind, and allows it to receive anavalanche of visions, messages, and ideas, which are both the physical andetheric substance of your brains (Mind). In other words, you are retrieving,scanning, and storing all sorts of new ideas, and thoughts, which will enrichyour learning experience.In addition, the expansion of a wider mental perception superposes the Araya(Net of the mind) of your physical mind and the Araya of your Supersymetric Mind(Your other mind that exists as a bulk of separate particles in an ethericsubstance.)And when this happens, you will have instant access to an amazingly vast depotof knowledge and information stored in a cosmic library.You “regular” mind can’t reach this library, because it resides in the realm ofthe Supersymetric Mind.In addition to moving one triangle from one place to another one, (Which couldseem silly to some!) your mind has learned now how to switch on and off anordinary mind, and listen to frequencies, waves, and vibrations that containextraordinary information and knowledge.This would enhance your imagination, creativity, productivity, and eliminatephysical and mental obstacles blocking many of your projects, endeavors, andpioneering work. Nizraat Takaroob adds an extra dimension of knowledge,information, and awareness to your “regular” Mind. Knowledge is power.Who has power succeeds. Information strengthens your position, and allows you toconsider and evaluate all the possibilities, even foresee the outcome andconsequences of your decisions. And awareness makes you alert, keeps you inharmonious synchronization with your environment, and what is going on aroundyou.Once, you have mastered the Nizraat Takaroob technique, you will be able toapply it pragmatically in all your endeavors, including decision making,business transactions, investment, communications, and rapports with others. But do not forget to keep in yor heart, a warm place for the needy, andespecially those who need help, and cannot return the favor. Remember, each timeyou give from your heart, you grow one inch taller, and the sky is the limit. *** *** *** The Conduit [Image00037.jpg] I. IntroductionII.

Introduction:In many of my books, I wrote ad infinitum about the Conduit, and theSupersymetric Mind. Yet, for some reasons, numerous readers could not grasptheir essence and understand their meaning.Almost in each book I wrote about the esoteric and metaphysical aspectsurrounding the Anunnaki and the Anunnaki Ulema, a generous portion on thesubject of the Conduit and the power of the Supersymetric Mind was given, and amultitude of pertinent cases were discussed.I do not wish to repeat myself ad nauseam, in this current work, for those whohate my guts have so rightfully criticized me for doing so in the past. Othersargued that the subject of the Conduit and the Supersymetric Mind was indeedfully explored in several passages in my previous books, but since these booksare pricey, they could not afford to buy every single one that discussed thesetopics.I do agree with them, first, because it would cost a small fortune to buy allthese books, and second, those passages were scattered here and there -asnecessity required- and thus, they were either hard to find, or quite possiblylost in the immensity of the published work. But since, the subject of the Conduit and the Supersymetric Mind is still notclear to many, revisiting previous studies and writings on these two subjectsbecomes a necessity. Of course, I will not fall prey to repetitions; however, Iwill reproduce herewith what it is deemed essential for comprehending andassimilating –and once for good – what a Conduit is, and how a SupersymetricMind functions. II. Definition:The Conduit is an infinitesimally small cell in our brain, not yet detectedand/or acknowledged by mainstream science.We have learned about it from the enlightened masters, and the illuminatedteachers, members of the Anunnaki Ulema Jami’ya (Circle, society).It was first mentioned in:> • a-Anunnaki Ulema’s kira’at (Anunnaki Ulema’s readings, lectures);> • b-Dirasaat Alfikr (Anunnaki Ulema’s study or science of the mind);> • c-The manuscript/book of Ramadosh;> • d-The manuscript Kitabu Ilmu Aldonia (The book of the Knowledge of the> world/universe).> • e-The scrolls of Kanoun Alhayaat wa Nizamou Alkawn (The laws or principles> of life and order of the universe). All these manuscripts were written in Ana’kh, Rouhaniyaat and pre-Islamicarchaic Arabic. Some were translated into Farsi, Urdu, and Akkadian. Worthmentioning here, that a few passages from the Anunnaki Ulema’s kira’at, and theBook of Ramadosh, were found in Ugaritic and Phoenician texts.As you already know, we were genetically fashioned and created by the Anunnaki,some 65,000 years ago. At the time they created us, our physical body wasdeformed and underdeveloped, but much later, and after numerous geneticmanipulations by the Anunnaki gods and goddesses, the human body became robustand exceptionally strong.But one thing was missing: Intelligence. In other words, our mind was not fullyoperational, and the brain as a primordial motor for the body was stagnant.Aruru, Namu, and other Anunnaki geneticists became fond of the human race, anddecided to install in our brain a sequence of mental faculties. However, the“Conduit” was not one of the brain’s cells, the Anunnaki developed.Thousands of years later, the “Conduit” became fully operational in the brain ofthe Anunnaki’s remnants, who were partially humans and partially aliens orextraterrestrials.The Anunnaki Ulema are the offspring of this hybrid race. As such, their“Conduit” became fully active.According to Master Mordachai ben Zvi, by 2022, “many humans will have theopportunity to globally activate their Conduit.”The Conduit could be described as a vast depot of knowledge acquired in thisdimension, from other dimensions, parallel, adjacent or beyond the knownuniverse, from a physical sphere of time and space, as well as from a non-lineartime-space.Simply put, the Conduit is a time-space sponge that retains everything thattouches on the surface of experience, memory, learning, emotions, intelligence,and creativity. And this surface is not limited by physical boundaries.It transcends time and space.The Anunnaki Ulema taught us that the Conduit links us to multiple spheres ofexistences, zones and physical-mental circumstances we are not familiar with,such as, to name a few: 1-The Miraya:The Anunnaki’s Miraya contains, stores and reflects all the knowledge, sounds,ideas, events, thoughts, past, present and future that exist in the universe.However, they do agree with the notion that the Miraya could be substituted withholographic screens. In fact, the Ulema were the first to talk and teach aboutspatial holography, holography screen, and Collective Mind, sometimes called the“Anunnaki Collective Depot of Knowledge” shared by all the Anunnaki communities’members.The Anunnaki Ulema teach that human life is neither a restricted part of thedivine creation, nor the creation itself. Thus, it is not limited by time,space, and the frontiers of a divine matrix. 2-The Double,3-The Astral Body.4-The Jaba.5-The Fikr.6-Khateyn Tarika. Those who study under the wings of the Anunnaki Ulema will, soon or later, learnhow to activate their Conduit. It takes years of study, meditation, fasting,mind-transmission, and a rigid spiritual-mental discipline. However, some of us,could partially open the Conduit, if we practice the Anunnaki Ulema Tarkiz(Concentration/Meditation exercises), and learn some of the state of Onenesstechniques, I have described in this book.An open (Active) Conduit produces or facilitates extraordinary phenomena anddeeds, such as, to name a few:> • a-Telepathy;> • b-Reading mind;> • c-Sensing danger and preventing threatening situations from happening;> • d-Undertaking and completing multiple tasks in no time. You will be able to> finish several projects simulteanously, which in ordinary cases, would require> weeks, if not months;> • e-The healing touch;> • f-Learning so many languages, effortlessly and with a mind-bending speed.> • g-Foreseeing future events;> • h-Telemetry. You touch any object and right away you know its origin;> • i-Entering another dimension, whether physically or mentally;> • j-Moving objects at distance;> • k-Neutralizing bad (Negative) vibes, and malicious (Vicious)> thoughts/intentions aimed at you, and at your Katheyn Tarika zone;> • l-Teleportation, so on. Haridu “Haridu-ilmu” Haridu is the interpretation of messages sent to the Conduit in an Anunnaki’s ora human’s brain cell. Also, it applies to missing or misinterpreting a messageby the Conduit.On this, Ulema Rabbi Mordechai said verbatim:> • “First of all, you have to remember that your mind (Your brain) has nothing> to do with your Conduit. Even though, your brain is functioning wonderfully> and you are doing great things in your life, not all the cells in your brain> have been used.> • There are so many regions in our brain that have not been explored yet by> science.> • In those many unexplored regions of the brain, are so many cells yet to be> discovered, located and localized. And above all, we need to learn how they> function.> • In that mysterious undiscovered region of the brain, the Condu it exists. It> could be in the right or left side of your brain, or just adjacent to line> dividing the two parts.> • In the Conduit, there are so many cells, each one with a very defined and> particular extraordinary faculty/power, that needs to be activated.> • For instance, one cell triggers the faculty of reading others’ thoughts,> another cell (Or cells) is responsible for the faculty of teleportation, so> on.> • If those cells are not activated, you will not be able to do all those> wonderful things.> • So, you have to consider the Conduit as a bank where so many cells are> deposited. And there are hundreds of thousands of cells deposited in the> Conduit.> • Each cell has a precise function and an invisible location.> • This means that the Conduit can do so many things, if cells are activated.> It would be impossible in one lifespan to develop and activate all the cells.> • Three or four fully activated cells is more than enough. With four> activated cells you can do four great miracles by earth’s standards.> • But for the cell to produce this extraordinary power, the cell must be able> first to understand what you want to do.> • For instance, you cannot tell or command your cell “go ahead and make me> fly or let me learn a new language in one hour.”> • You should first learn how to send your command to your cell. There is a> technique for this.> • Your Ulema teacher knows how to put you on the right track.> • Let’s assume you have sent a message (A thought, a wish) to your cell.> What’s next?> • Well, the message enters your Conduit. Your conduit acting as a supervisor,> and as the main receiver reads your message and directs your message to the> appropriate cell.> • Your Conduit knows which cell is activated and designed to comply with your> request.> • Instantly, the cell receives the Conduit transfer (Meaning your message.)> • Then what?> • The cell reads your message.> • If your message was sent correctly, then the cell will accept it and give> it a code. So, if in the future you ask again your Conduit to do the same> thing you have asked in the past, the cell will execute your request in a> fraction of a second.> • In other words, each request is coded, and stored in your cell.> • Only coded messages are stored in your Conduit.> • How would you know if you have or have not sent a message correctly to your> Conduit? You will know right away.> • It is very simple. If you have not been trained, you wouldn’t know where> and how to start in the first place.> • This is the reason why your Conduit did not catch your message(s).> • You asked “Does this mean that my Conduit is not receiving clear messages> from me? And the answer is yes!> • Your Conduit received something, a thought, a feeling, a wish, a request,> call it whatever you want, but your message was not clear to your Conduit,> because you did not send your message according to the rules.> • What are these rules?> • They are explained below. But continue to read this first.> • And then you asked: “And how can I send clear messages my Conduit can catch> and understand?> • You have to use the “Transmission of Mind” technique. Practice this> technique before you send messages to your Conduit. For example, in the past,> the SOS (Morse Code) was used by ships, planes, military troops and others.> • The person who has sent the message (Morse) knew the Code; he/she knew how> to tap it.> • Each word had a code…one dot, two dots, three dots, one dash, two dashes,> three dashes, one dit, two dits, one space, two spaces, three spaces, etc.> • There is a sequence of pulses and marks. And the person who received the> message knew what these dots, and dashes meant.> • This is how and why he/she was able to read the message or decipher it, if> it was a secret message.> • Your Conduit works exactly in the same way.> • Your Ulema teacher will tell you exactly what dots and sequences to use.> • If your Conduit is hundred percent awake, meaning Open (After training> completion), the Conduit will immediately interpret/translate and understand> your dots, dashes and sequences.> • Consider those dashes and dots a “Password”, a log-in information, a key to> open the contact with your Conduit, just like the password you use to open> your computer or have access to some websites.> • In the Book of Ramadosh, you will find several passages referring to the> brain waves and mind frequencies, and> some techniques used to direct thoughts and mind energies.> • Your Conduit has its own mode. As long as your Conduit is not activated, it> remains free of your control. Once your Conduit is activated, you become the> stimulus and the manager of your Conduit.> • The Conduit works partially when it is not activated.> • And partially means reacting by not acting.> • The Conduit functions all the time regardless of your state of awareness,> enlightenment or readiness. But it will not give you data and information.> • Everything the Conduit finds is instantly deposited in its compound.> • You will not find what’s in there, until the Conduit is fully activated.> • Consider it for now as a depot of knowledge; a sort of a personal bank> account where your daily balance is constantly increasing, however, you are> not allowed to have access to your bank account.> • So, nothing is lost.> • Your Conduit collects and stores information all the time, and from various> sources, times, and spheres. Jaba:In Ana’kh, the word Jaba means many things. For example:> • a -The “Net Jaba” is a time-space pocket.> • b -The “Jaba-Garidu” is related to the “Conduit” cell, and adjacent cells> in the brain.> • c -The “Jaba-Abru” is related to time management, using the power of mind> to achieve multiple and lengthy tasks simultaneously.Note: Please refer to the book “The Book of Ramadosh”, latest edition, 2010,where you will find an in-depth study of the subject. Fik’r “Fik-R’r”, “Fik.Ra.Sa” :The ability of reading others’ thoughts. The esoteric Arabic word “Firasa” isderived from Fik.Ra.Sa. It means in Arabic the ability to read thoughts, tounderstand the psyche of a person just by looking at him/her. The Ulema usedFik’r to read the mind, learn about the intentions of others, and assess thelevel of intelligence of people.The soul is an invention of early humans who needed to believe in a next life.It was through the soul that mortals could and would hope to continue to liveafter death. Soul as an element or a substance does not exist anywhere insidethe human body.Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes the brainfunction, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul.The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the time theycreated the final form of the human race. Fik’r was not used in the early sevenprototypes of the creation of mankind according to the Sumerian texts. The“Fik’r”, although it is the primordial source of life for our physical body, itis not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is thephysical description of our genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers andsequences of what there in our body, the data and history of our genes, geneticorigin, ethnicity, race, so on. Thus Fik’r includes DNA. The Ulema said:“Consider Fik’r as a cosmic-sub-atomic-intellectual-extraterrestrial (Meaningnon-physical, non-earthly) depot of all what it constituted, constitutes andshall continue to constitute everything about you. And it is infinitesimallysmall.However, it can expand to an imaginable dimension, size and proportions. Itstays alive and continues to grow after we pass away if it is still linked tothe origin of its creation, in our case the Anunnaki. The Fik’r is linked to theAnunnaki our creators through a “Conduit” found in the cells of the brain. Fornow, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble. After death, this bubbleleaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as the bubble leaves the body.The body dies because the bubble leaves the body. Immediately, with one tenth ofone million of a second, the molecule or the bubble frees itself from any andeverything physical, including the atmosphere, the air, and the light;absolutely everything we can measure, and everything related to earth, includingits orbit.The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to stand judgment andawait the decision of god -whether you have to go to heaven or hell– becausethere is no hell and there is no heaven the way we understand hell and heaven.So it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhistor a believer in any other religion.The molecule (Bubble) enters the original blueprint of “YOU”; meaning the firstcopy, the first sketch, the first formula that created you. Humans came from ablueprint. Every human being has a double. Your double is a copy stored in the“Rouh-Plasma”; a compartment under the control of the Anunnaki on Nibiru and canbe transported to another star, if Nibiru (Ne.Be.Ru-Ashtari) ceases to exist.And this double is immortal.In this context, human is immortal, because its double never dies. Once themolecule re-enters your original copy (Which is the original You), you come backto life with all your faculties, including your memory, but without physical,emotional and sensorial properties (The properties you had on earth), becausethey are not perfect.”Ulema Sadik said: “At that time, and only at that time, you will decide whetherto stay in your double or go somewhere else…the universe is yours. If your pastlife on earth accumulated enough good deeds such as charity, generosity,compassion, forgiveness, goodness, mercy, love for animals, respect for nature,gratitude, fairness, honesty, loyalty…then your double will have all thewonderful opportunities and reasons to decide and select what shape, format,condition you will be in, and where you will continue to live.”In other words, you will have everything, absolutely everything and you can haveany shape you want including a brand new corporal form. You will be able tovisit the whole universe and live for ever, as a mind, as an indestructiblepresence, and also as a non-physical, non-earthly body, but you can stillre-manifest yourself in any physical body you wish to choose.Worth mentioning here, that the molecule, (So-called soul in terrestrial term)enters a mew dimension by shooting itself into space and passing through the“Baab”, a sort of a celestial star-gate or entrance.If misguided, your molecule (So-called your soul) will be lost for ever in theinfinity of time and space and what there is between, until reconnected to yourprototype via the “Miraya”.Is the afterlife a physical world? According to the Anunnaki Ulema: “No and yes.Because life after death unites time and space and everything that itconstitutes space and time.It means extending to, and encompassing everything in the universe, andeverything you saw, knew, felt, liked and disliked. Everything you haveexperienced on earth exists in other dimensions, and there are lots of them.Everything you saw on earth has its duplicate in another dimension. Even yourpast, present and future on earth have another past, another present and anotherfuture in other worlds and other dimensions.And if you are lucky and alert, you can create more pasts, more presents andmore futures, and continue to live in new wonderful worlds and dimensions; thishappens after you die.Anunnaki and some of their messengers and remnants on earth can do that. Thephysical aspect of the afterlife can be recreated the way you want it by usingyour Fik’r. Yes, you can return to earth as a visitor, and see all the shows andmusicals on Broadway or hang out on Les Champs - Elysées. You can also talk tomany people who died if you can find their double in the afterlife.You can also enjoy the presence of your pets (Dead or alive), and continue toread a book you didn’t finish while still alive on earth. What you currently seeon earth is a replica of what there is beyond earth and beyond death.The afterlife is also non physical, because it has different properties, densityand ways of life.”Anunnaki Ulema W. Lin said: “Through Fik’r, a person can enter higherdimensions. It is of a major importance to train your Fik’r. “Transmission ofthe mind” training sessions can develop extra-sensorial faculties and open your“inner eye” commonly referred to as the Third Eye…”The Fik’r, although it is the primordial source of life for our physical body,it is not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of Fik’r; DNA is thephysical description of our genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers andsequences of what there is in our body, the data and history of our genes,genetic origin, ethnicity, race, so on.The Fik’r contains the DNA and all its genetic data. Fikrama “Fikr-Rama”:Name of the human brain’s sixth wave, unknown yet to science.It is related to An-zalubirach, also known as Tarkiz; a mental training thatdevelops a supernatural power. To fully understand what Kikrama “Fikr-Rama”means, we must first comprehend what An-zalubirach is, and how it works.An-zalubirach is an Ana’kh/Ulemite term meaning the following:> • a -Collecting thoughts, receiving and sending multiple mental images via> brain wave synchronization, to improve mental and physical health ;> • b- Using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phases and practices of Tarkiz.Tarkiz means deep mental or intellectual concentration that produces telekinesisand teleportation phenomena. Ulema’s students learn this technique in variousforms.Basically it works like this:> • a -The students use their Conduit (Which is located in the brain’s cells) to> control the waves of their brains (First level of learning) .> • b -The students concentrate on an object hidden behind a screen or a divider> made from thin rice paper. (Second level of learning)By synchronizing the frequency of their Conduit and an absolute state ofintrospection, the students attempt to move the hidden object from one place toanother without even touching it.In a more advanced stage, the students attempt to alter the properties of theobject by lowering or increasing the frequencies and vibrations of the objectitself. The brain is constantly producing different types of frequencies, waves,and vibrations, and transmitting various messages based on our mental activity,feelings, thoughts, and state of consciousness or mind.Thus, the brain waves are divided in four states or categories called:1- Beta2- Alpha3- Theta4- Delta In addition to Betha, Alpha, Theta, and Delta, the Anunnaki Ulema developed asixth wave called Fikr-Rama. It is neither measurable nor detectable, because itdoes not emanate from the physical brain. It is triggered by the Conduitsituated in the brain’s cells. No science on earth can direct us to the exactposition of the Conduit. Let me explain this process:> • 1 -Through the mechanism of the Conduit, the enlightened ones regulate> mind’s waves and frequencies.> • 2 -The Fikr-Rama allows them to enter other dimensions, solid substances and> matter.> • 3 -The Fikr-Rama is a sort of a beam much lighter than laser. It does not> have particles.> • 4 -It has no substance per se, yet, it contains energy.> • 5 -Extraterrestrials in general, and Anunnaki in particular have a multitude> of similar brain’s waves.> • 6 -The Fikr-Rama is one single tone in the rainbow of their mental> vibrations.> • 7 -Highly advanced extraterrestrial beings can project thoughts and> holographic images using any of their mental vibrations waves. Kira-Fik:Composed from two words:> • a -Kira (From Kira’at) means reading,> • b -Fik (From Fk’r) meaning mind. The general meaning is the development, or the activation of telepathy in thebrain of an Anunnaki student. Before the pre-final phase of an Anunnaki studentpurification, what happens takes only one minute, and this is the most importantprocedure done for each Anunnaki student on the first day of his/her studies –the creation of the mental “Conduit.”A new identity is created for each Anunnaki student by the development of a newpathway in his or her mind, connecting the student to the rest of the Anunnaki’spsyche. Simultaneously, the cells check with the “other copy” of the mind andbody of the Anunnaki student, to make sure that the “Double” and “Other Copy” ofthe Mind and body of the student are totally clean. During this phase, theAnunnaki student temporarily loses his or her memory, for a very shorttime. This is how the telepathic faculty is developed, or enhanced in everyone.It is necessary, since to serve the total community of the Anunnaki, theindividual program inside each Anunnaki studentis immediately shared with everybody. Incidentally, this is why there is such abig difference between extra-terrestrial and human telepathy.On earth, no one ever succeeds in emptying the whole mental content from humancells like the Anunnaki are so adept in doing, and the Conduit cannot be formed.Lacking the Conduit that is built for each Anunnaki, the human mind is notcapable in communication with the extra-terrestrials. However, don’t think for amoment that there is any kind of invasion of privacy. The simplistic idea of anyof your friends tapping into your private thoughts does not exist for theAnunnaki. Their telepathy is rather complicated. The Anunnaki have collectiveintelligence and individual intelligence. And this is directly connected to twothings:> • a -The first is the access to the “Community Depot of Knowledge” that any> Anunnaki can tap in and update and acquire additional knowledge.> • b -The second is an “Individual Prevention Shield,” also referred to as> “Personal Privacy.” This means that an Anunnaki can switch on and off his/her direct link (achannel) to other Anunnaki. By establishing the “Screen” or “Filter” an Anunnakican block others from either communicating with him or her, or simply preventingothers from reading his or her personal thoughts.“Filter”, “Screen” and “Shield” are interchangeably used to describe the privacyprotection. In addition, an Anunnaki can program telepathy and set it up onchosen channels, exactly as we turn on our radio set and select the station wewish to listen to. Telepathy has several frequency, channels and stations. Afik-r’-Tanawar: .Enlightenment through the development of the mind. Composed of two words;> • a -Afik-r, which means mind.> • b- Tanawar, which means the act of illumination. The Anunnaki have created us on earth to serve their needs.Their intentions were to create a race that could carry heavy physical load anddo intense physical labor. This was the initial and prime objective. Thus, the“Naphsiya” (DNA) they put in us had limited lifespan, and mental faculties.Later on, they discovered that they had to prolong the human lifespan and addmore developed mental faculties, so they added the Hara-Kiya (Internal energy orphysical strength).Few generations later, the early human beings stock evolves considerably,because the Anunnaki added fully operational Mind in the human body. To do so,they installed a Conduit with limited capabilities. In the same time, thisConduit was also installed into the prototype of the human body. Thus, throughthe Mind, the physical body of the humans got linked to the Double. . Thisnon-physical link created a Fourth dimension for all of us. In fact, it did notcreate a Fourth dimension per se, rather it activated it.So now, at that stage, humans had a physical dimension (Life on earth), andnot-a-totally separated non-physical dimension called Nafis-Ra. So, the Bashar(Humans) became destined to acquire two dimensions, as exactly the Anunnakidecided.Later on, centuries upon centuries, the human mind began to evolve, because theother Mind, call it now the Double or prototype began to evolve simultaneouslyand in sync.The more the prototype is advanced the more the “Physical Mind” becomes alert,creative and multidimensional. But we are not trapped, and our mind is no longerconditioned by the Anunnaki.The Anunnaki gave us all the choices, opportunities, freewill and freedom tolearn on our own and progress. This is why we are accountable and responsiblefor everything we do and think about. Because of the evolution of our mind, andrealization of an inner knowledge of our surroundings, and understanding what isright and what is wrong, a major mental faculty emerged in all of us:Conscience.” III. Developing the Conduit :There are techniques which are partially physical and partially mental. Youcould refer to them as psychosomatic. In this book, I have provided you withsome techniques that could and would partially open your Conduit and activateyour Supersymetric Mind. As a beginner, you cannot tap directly into yourConduit, because you don’t know where it is located in your brain.Your teacher will help you locate the Conduit cell, and will instruct you onsome postures and positions, needed to enter the zone of the Conduit, and tostart sending and receiving Mirsals; Sent or received by your mind.These positions will create internal muscular vibrations, and your mind willread them. You will be sending m ental/visionary lines, and their frequencieswill activate the cell of the Conduit.By the power of concentration and introspection, you will start to getintensified activity in the brain. This causes a buzz vibration in the brain theConduit begins to detect. Then, the Conduit will absorb the vibrations andorganize them, and from that moment on, the Conduit will take over. To summarize: B y attempting certain activities, you are sending a message toyour Conduit. It will take some time, because at the beginning, your Conduit maynot catch the messages, or if it does, your brain or your Conduit may notinterpret the messages correctly, because the Conduit is not one hundred percentawake.With practice, the Conduit becomes familiar with these type s of messages, andwill start to give them Ishara (Codes).Each activity , including thoughts, intentions, postures/positions, andexercises would have their own code. *** *** *** One exercise to partially activate the Conduit.Activating, or opening the Conduit is an enigmatic and difficult undertaking.Some, called this process a complicated mental maneuver. And they are not wrong.Similar to the Supersymetric Mind, the Conduit cannot be detected, measured, andlocated.Therefore, activating the Conduit is not a physical process.“So, if we can’t see it, and if we can’t locate it, how one could possiblyactivate this damned thing?” asked me one of my readers from the United States.I don’t blame him.It makes sense, taking into consideration, the laws of physics, logic, andcommon sense. But, if we listen to the Hadith of Ulema Al-Baydani, we might getthe correct answer. Excerpts from the Hadith of Ulema Al-Baydani, given at Maa’had al Iskandariya,in 1963.Note: I was there for my apprenticeship. Student: Honorable Master, is the Conduit, some sort of energy?Ulema Al-Baydani: Yes, and much more than that.Student: Can we see this energy?Ulema Al-Baydani: Can you see electricity? No, only sparkles and its effects.Can you see electricity running inside a wire? No, but it is there.Student: But you do see it?Ulema Al-Baydani: Many do.Student: Who, for example?Ulema Al-Baydani: The honorable Moualamiin (Teachers), and the graduatedstudents.Student: Only them?Ulema Al-Baydani: Only them.Student: Are you going to teach us how to see the Conduit?Ulema Al-Baydani: I will show you the way, when you are ready.Student: I am ready, Master.Ulema Al-Baydani: You are not.A pause.The student is upset.Student: Do I have a Conduit?Ulema Al-Baydani: Yes, you do.Student: Do Jamil and Kumar have a Conduit too?Note: Jamil and Kumar are students (Talaa-miza) at the Maa’had Ulema Al-Baydani: Yes, they do. Everybody does.Student: Are they ready? (Referring to Jamil and Kumar)Ulema Al-Baydani: It is none of your concern.Student: When I am ready, will you teach me how to open my Conduit?Ulema Al-Baydani: When you are ready, you will find the way. And if you don’t, Iwill be there to teach you. And when you are ready, you will stop asking allthese questions, because your mind will have all the answers. The less you talk,the more you learn. Note: Readiness means a state of spiritual/mental purification, which resultedfrom observing the Kanoon and Nizam, and completing the orientation program.This could take several years. Another student: Honorable Master, can we open the Conduit temporarily?Ulema Al-Baydani: Wisdom is no a temporary matter.Student: Do we have to wait so many years before we learn how to open theConduit?Ulema Al-Baydani: Patience is virtue. You don’t have to wait so many years. Thenoble in spirits can accomplish this, when their minds are free from attachmentto materialistic values, and their hearts are full of goodness.Student: Then, good people could learn it very quickly?Ulema Al-Baydani: Yes!Student: Is it like the Ayn Nabaha (Similar to what it commonly called the ThirdEye)?Ulema Al-Baydani: No.Student: Can you teach me a technique to explore the Conduit?Ulema Al-Baydani: Good question Rabih. Exploring is a virtue. Note: The master did not say “I will teach you how to open the Conduit.” Wisely,he replied, “Exploring is a virtue.” Meaning, that opening or activating theConduit is not a matter of learning, but exploring and researching the truth; atruth built upon enlightenment and the Oneness. And this leads me to invite youto explore the Conduit, instead of activating it. If you persevere with humilityand sincerity, you will be able to partially open your Conduit.I can’t divulge the secrets of the Conduit, and show the whole world how toactivate it. But, I can provide you with a technique that could help you in yoursincere quest. And if you still need additional guidance, email me atdelafayette6@aol.com [delafayette6@aol.com]But you will have to answer some questions, and we will go from there.Thetechnique you are about to learn is called Tamadi Fikru. Its phases areillustrated on the following pages.I will comment on each illustration, and provide you with the necessaryorientation/guidance. Tamadi Fikru: Prerequisites and Preparation:In order to succeed in Fikrou Jalsah, which will partially activate your Conduitfor a certain period of time, you must meet the requirements outlined on thispage. We have lots of things to do here, but I am going to help you, all theway.A friendly reminder: If your intentions are selfish or vicious, you will notsucceed in opening the Conduit. You must free yourself from all bad and negativethoughts. It is simple; come forward clean, in peace, and with good intentions.And during the first 6 months of your journey on the road of and toward MiraNourim, (Knowledge via the visions of light), you must repeat this exercise, atleast twice a week, otherwise, your Conduit will weaken, and eventuallydissipate.Diet: Refrain from consuming alcohol and eating fat for a period of three daysbefore you start your exercise.Hygiene: Be clean, absolutely clean during the exercise.Take a bath before you start the exercise.Position/stance: Sit comfortably in a chair, of just on the floor.State of mind: Only good intentions.Believe in yourself. Believe in this technique.Clothes: Light colors are recommended. No dark suits.Place: Be alone. You can practice anywhere, as long as you are by yourself, andfar from noise, metallic objects, and electronic gadgets.Day: Any day.Time: Always late in the afternoon, and evening hours.Tools: None. Just use your mind. Step #1: Look at the illustration #1 on page 274.1. The Sphere (Globe, circle) you see in this illustration, is the zone you aregoing to enter, using your mind. Look at the Sphere for 10 seconds or so. Takenow a deep breath. [Image00038.gif]Illustration #1: The Sphere [Image00039.jpg] 2. Now, close your eyes for 20 seconds, and during that time, tell yourself, youare going to project the Sphere, right in front of yourself. Do not open youreyes yet. In other words, just imagine or visualize the Sphere before you. Yougot to convince yourself that the Sphere is there, in front of you. Let yourimagination do this. I know, it is not real yet.It is a fantasy, an imagination exercise, but that’s fine, because somethingamazing is going to happen soon. Keep imagining. It is going to work.3. After 20 seconds or so, the Sphere could appear before you, inside the realmof your mind. If not, open your eyes, and do it again. Take now a deep breath.In case, nothing happens at all, do this:a-Open you eyes. Take now a deep breath. Close the left eye for 3 seconds.b-Now, open the left eye, and close the right eye for 3 seconds.c-Repeat this exercise for 20 seconds or so.Take now a deep breath.d-Now close both eyes for 20 seconds, and within yourself, tell your mind tobring the Sphere before you.e-Move your head, right and left for 5 seconds. Do not open your eyes yet!! Takenow a deep breath.f-Try to remember the shape and size of the Sphere.g-Try to remember the shades inside and outside the Sphere.h-In your mind, imagine that there is an empty space in the center of theSphere. Take now a deep breath.i-In your mind, try to bring yourself closer to the empty space in the center ofthe Sphere. Do not open your eyes yet!!j-Imagine that you are getting closer to the Sphere, and the Sphere is gettingbigger and bigger. Take now a deep breath.k-That’s wonderful, you are almost there. Now, enter the Sphere. You are goingto feel as if somebody is pushing you gently toward the Sphere. You will startto feel some sort of dizziness. Do not worry, it is working.l-Now, you are inside the Sphere, from the shoulders up. And you are going tofeel it. You are in. Take now a deep breath.See Illustration #2, on page 276. Go now to page 276. Illustration #2 [Image00040.gif]Step #2: Look at the illustration #3 on page 278.a-Now, you are inside the Sphere, from the shoulders up. And you are going tofeel it. You are in.See Illustration #2, on page 276.b-You are going to feel that you are already inside the Sphere.c-You are going to sense the presence of two lines on your right and on yourleft. Take now a deep breath.See Illustration #3, on page 278.d-These two lines are real, even though they are not visible to the naked eye.Some Ulema described them as the two invisible line of Khateyn Tarika. Otherssaid, that they are the manifestation of your inner energy. In any case, thesetwo lines (Khateyn) are a mental-physical energy produced by your mind and yourbody.They are created by the chemical and bio-organic elements in your body (Like abattery), and manifested on the outside by the power of your mind. They are NOTyour aura, but simply, a form of an inner energy that manifests itself duringthis exercise.In the future, you will be able to see these two lines around other people,whether parallel to their body, or swirling around their body, depending ontheir health condition, and mental level.If you still don’t sense or feel the two lines, do this:a-Place your left thumb between your eyebrows (line 2) , and your right palm online 4, count to 180 (Approx. 3 minutes) and take a deep breath after 180seconds. It should work. If not, stop the exercise, and do it another time.See illustration on page 279, for the position of your thumb and palm. *** *** *** [Image00041.gif]I[Image00041.gif] llustration #3 [Image00042.gif] [Image00043.gif] I[Image00041.gif] [Image00041.gif] llustration #4 [Image00044.gif] [Image00041.gif] [Image00041.gif] ti5 Step #3: Look at the illustration #4 on page 280.a-Now, the 2 lines are expanding. This, means that your energy is increasing.b-You will be able to sense this expansion, and physically you will feel aroundyou, the increase in your energy. Take a deep breath.c-Tell your mind that your body needs to exist the Sphere. You got to freeyourself from the perimeter of the Sphere?Why?Because the Sphere is your physical zone, the area that keeps you attached to aphysical environment, and you don’t need that.Your mind as well as your body should become absolutely free. And you can do it,by following these instructions:1-Extand both arms toward the Sphere.2-Now, join both hands (Put your hands together) always in front of you, likethis (See illustration below): [Image00045.gif] 3-Bring both hands toward your head, and place them against your forehead.(Level 1 of the illustration on page 279). Keep them there for 10 seconds. Then,drop them down, very slowly.4-Look at illustration #5, on page 282. We are heading toward Step #4. [Image00046.gif] Step #4: Illustration #5 depicts your detachment from the Sphere. If you have reached this step, this is a great sign; you are doing wonderfully.And there is a magnificent surprise for you. As soon as your body is outside theSphere, your Conduit will kick off, meaning, it is on its way to be partiallyopen, but not activated yet. Eventually, you will be able to do it, once youreach Step #5. I know you are getting excited, but you have to remain calm.Take a deep breath.You are not entirely free physically.You are not entirely free mentally.But you are on the right track.Now look at illustration #6, on page 284; it demonstrates your new state ofmind. And this state of mind will lead you toward the preliminary state of apartial opening of your Conduit.The Conduit will partially open up when you reach Step #5.Pertinent explanation and instructions are provided on page 285. So let’s gothere. *** *** *** [Image00047.gif] Step #5: This step is related to illustration #7, on page 286. a-Nothing to do now. Just stay calm. Take a deep breath.b-Part of your Supersymetric Mind is ready to engage you into a mentalconversation. And this conversation will take shape not verbally, butholographically. Meaning, you are going to see a projection of a screen rightbefore your eyes.c-The holographic screen or grid as known to others, will be projected by yourSupersymetric Mind.d-You will be able to see it, once the Conduit is partially activated, and it isgoing to happen in a few second.e-Look now at illustration #8, on page 288. Let’s go there, and read additionalinformation and instructions on page 287. *** *** *** [Image00048.gif] Step #6: This step is related to illustration #8, on page 288. a-Do not open your eyes. Keep them close all the time, until you complete thewhole process (The entire exercise).b-Now, your Conduit is partially open, but not fully activated. It does notmatter, really.Because now, you are going to experiment and experience some phenomena, fewprivileged people in our modern world had the opportunity to witness.c-Suddenly, a screen or a grid will be projected, and you will be able to seeit, even with closed eyes, because it is in your mind.d-From now on, your “regular mind” becomes dormant, and your Supersymetric Mindwill take over.This sudden transition is produced by the awakening of your Conduit.e-During this stage, your Conduit is a minor tool you can use temporarily touncover lots of things, and especially to deal with, and/or remove problems thatare causing you lots of headache.At this stage, your Conduit is NOT activated permanently.It is operational only during this exercise. Nevertheless, it is a powerfultool, because it allows you to remove up to “4 Knots” that they are blocking youfrom progressing in life.Additional information and explanation on these “Knots” are en route. Relax, andtake a deep breath. Oh yes, I know, there are lots of breathing stuff here. Butyou need it. One day, I will tell you all about the great benefits andextraordinary powers you can develop by breathing the right way.f-Let’s go now to page 289 to read about Step #7. *** *** *** [Image00049.gif] Step #7: It is related to illustration #9, on page 290. a-The holographic screen will start to get bigger and bigger. And soon you willbe able to read and/or see events from your own life, some from the past, andothers from your present and future.b-It is NOT hallucinations, because you, and only you, know so much aboutyourself, and your confidential matters. If the screen projects these events,and if the screen allows you to face and see the problems you are having in yourlife, then, this should ipso facto, convince you without any doubt that you areneither dreaming nor hallucinating. No, you are not crazy, you are justexperiencing something mega extraordinary.c-At this stage, you have to wait for a few seconds, to allow the Conduit toenlarge further the screen (Grid).d-A lovely and bright light will emerge from the center of the screen (Grid).See it in illustration #10, on page 292.Let’s go there, and read pertinent information on pages 291 and 293. *** *** *** [Image00050.gif] Step #8: This step is related to illustration #10, on page 292. a-Just stay calm. Take a deep breath. Your Conduit is working.b-Your Conduit is going to project on the screen, images, symbols, geometricalshapes, and in some instances, portraits and animated images.c-In your case, as a beginner, you will only see squares, up to four, and muchless, if your Khateyn Tarika lines begin to weaken a little bit. Nevertheless,the squares will give you plenty of important information.d-This is the moment of truth. Because you are going to deal directly with whatis bothering you. You know your troubles, you know your own problems, you knowthe difficulties you are facing…so face everything with an absolute honesty,humility and an open mind.e-Get ready now to watch the squares.So, let’s go to illustration #11, on page 294, and read pertinent informationand explanation on page 293. *** *** *** [Image00051.gif] [Image00041.gif] [Image00041.gif] Step #9: This step is related to illustration #11, on page 294. a-This step is easy. Tell yourself (Basically, your Supersymetric Mind) to openup the squares.b-It is up to you how many squares you want to see. Four squares are themaximum. And if by now you are wondering what is the meaning of all that?Squares? Meaning what? And why?Well, it is very simple. Each square represents a major segment from your life,and above all, a major problem that you could not deal with in ordinarysituations. This is your chance to remove these difficulties, once and for good.If 4 squares are too much, then open up 3, or 2, even 1.c-Take a deep breath.d-Look at illustration #11, on page 294, and visualize the squares inside yourhead. They are there on the screen, alright, but you have to keep looking ateach one them, in no particular order. If you are lefty, start from the left.Your mind, vision and perception are all linked to the way you originally useyour hands. No time to explain this for now. Just keep looking at the squares,one by one.e-Let’s go right away to illustration #12, on page 296, and read pertinentinformation on page 295. *** *** *** [Image00052.gif] Step #10: This step is related to illustration #12, on page 296. a-Each square represents one “knot”.b-Each “knot” represents one of your problems.c-You may have more than 4 problems –I hope not–, but for now, we can only dealwith 4 major problems.d-What kind of problems? All sorts of problems; relationships, rapports withothers, dealing with clients, unpleasant situations at your workplace, financialdifficulties, you name it.e-Who is going to solve my problems?Who is going to untie these “knots”?Your Conduit! You better believe it. The next step will show you how.f-Let’s go now to illustration #[Image00041.gif] [Image00041.gif] 12 A, on page298. *** *** *** [Image00053.gif] Step #11: This step is related to illustration #12 A, on page 298. a-What’s going on here? Is it the same illustration on page 296. Yes, it is. Andintentionally, I reproduced it here for the following reasons:1-Sometime, the 4 squares remain attached to the screen (Grid). They don’t move.Don’t get upset.This means, that you are agitated. And when you are agitated and/or confused,your Supersymetric Mind gets perturbed.In this situation, your Conduit and Supersymetric Mind are not in synch.2-The screen will freeze. A déjà vu experience? Yes!Your computer! How many times did your computer freeze?Crash? Many times. The same thing applies to the holographic screen, bur fordifferent reasons.Because any of your vibes emanated by and from your body will affect theholographic screen, positively or negatively, any hollographic projection willeither benefit or suffer from it. You have to remember, that the whole exerciseis animated through mental waves produced by your Condit, like electricitycurrent. A bad vibe will freeze the squares on the screen.3-In this situation, take a deep breath, and readjust your setting, change yourstance, and find a more comfortable position. This will work.4-Let’s go now to illustration #14, on page 302, and read pertinent informationon page 299. *** *** *** [Image00054.gif] Step #12: This step is related to illustration #13, on page 300. a-This step deals with the removal of the knots one by one.b-This stage requires intense focusing, and a deep concentration.

Don’t be alarmed.Your Conduit is surrounding you with a halo of positive energy. It is chargingyour mind and body. Your Conduit has untied the knots, established theequilibrium of the two lines of Khateyn Tarika, stimulated your SupersymetricMind and “regular mind”, and above all, removed barriers that have blocked yourpath.You are going to feel extremely energetic yet delightfully serene, strong,robust, extremely alert, happy about yourself, and in you, within you, in yourmind, and the way you think, you are going to see things differently, observethings, objects and people very clearly, and understand situations you could notdeal with or understand in ordinary circumstances and situations.c-As soon as the screen vanishes, (See illustration #19, on page 311), you aregoing to experience and feel something absolutely wonderful. For example:1-Physiological nuisances, chronic pains, muscular fatigue, anxiety, fear,indecisiveness, laziness, and other unpleasant mishaps will be either reduced oreliminated.2-New opportunities will knock on your door, not because you have all of asudden acquired magical powers, far from it, but because, negative vibrations,and unhealthy Khaten Tarika lines were preventing others from giving you ahelping hand, and/or coming forward. You have blocked them, but now, the path isclear, you will become much happier, healthier, luckier, your face will shine,not very much, but enough to attract and please others, and above all, you willradiate, and your aura will show it. *** *** *** [Image00062.gif] [Image00063.gif] Step #18: This step is related to closing the exercise and the Zone of“Oneness”; phase one of the activation of the Conduit, on page 313. Closing the exercise:a-Bring yourself to a state of complete quietness. Relax.Take a deep breath. Stay where you are, and do not move for 2 minutes. Your eyesare still closed.b-Gradually open your eyes. And breathe again.c-Stand up very slowly.d-Turn around slowly from left to right.e-Now turn around from right to left. You are done! The Zone of “Oneness”:The exercise allowed you to enter the zone of Oneness for a very short time. Butthat is the beginning. The more you practice, the more you envelop yourself,mind and body, with flux of positive energy, and you will be surrounded by anetheric equilibrium that will enhance your performance in all your activities.You could even develop extra-ordinary faculties.But use this knowledge and awakening, wisely, humbly, with love, affection forothers, and especially toward those who caused you embarrassment and suffering.Look at the illustration of the Zone of “Oneness”.

What is Atmashabah?Entities and spirits entering your zone.Entering other people’s zoneIX. Technique for cleansing and strengthening your Khateyn TarikaHow to use it?Time and placePreparationThe process I. Introduction:If you are “Outside Khateyn Tarika”, you will never reach the top, in anythingyou do, no matter how happy, intelligent, influential, and rich you are.”The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin told us that every human being on Earth is lined upwith two invisible lines that determine her/his balance and harmony with theirimmediate surroundings, as well as the size and strength of his/her luck in thisphysical world. Khateyn means: Two Lines. It is the plural of Khat, which meansone line. They are invisible to the naked eye. The Rouhaniyiin nicknamed Khateyn“Tarik al Hayat”, meaning the road of life. These two lines determine how healthy, successful and balanced you are or willbe in your life. Tarika means a path, a road. It is usually linked to yourpresent and future, with major impact on your health, love life and business.Khateyn Tarika is directly linked to your “Double”, astral body, your mind,spirits and entities who live here on Earth, and in other dimensions. All of us,big and small, lucky and unlucky, rich and poor, famous, infamous and unknown,are conditioned and influenced by Khateyn Tarika two invisible lines that existeither ahead of our body, behind it, or around it.And the position and placement of these two lines that we cannot see –unless wewere taught how to find them– have a major impact on everything we do, and thinkabout. Khateyn Tarika technique will positively influence or change your life,health and luck. Khateyn Tarika is one of the most important, mind-bending and powerful parts ofIlmu (Knowledge and wisdom), and the secret doctrine of the Allamah andRouhaniyiin. If you unlock its secrets, you will reach your full potential, andaccomplish the impossible.Khateyn Tarika will put you on the right track, leading to spectacular success,power, harmony with your environment, and perfect health. The Honorable MasterKhafaja Sudki Ghayali said verbatim: “If you are “Outside Khateyn Tarika”, youwill never reach the top, in anything you do, no matter how happy, intelligent,influential, and rich you are.”The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin told us that every human being on Earth is lined upwith two invisible lines that determine her/his balance and harmony with theirimmediate surroundings, as well as the size and strength of his/her luck in thisphysical world.Ironically, people sometimes say: “You are out of line” without knowing the realand original meaning of this phrase!Where did this expression come from?And what do they mean by “Out of line”?And what “Line” are they talking about?They don’t know.It is just a very common and popular expression that applies to some situations,and debates/discussions we are familiar with.The expression “Out of line” appeared for the first time as a “Magicalmetaphysical” Jimlah in the book “Ilmu Al Donia”, written centuries ago inArabic and Persian. The first to use this expression were the Anunnaki-Ulema. II. What is Khateyn Tarika?Pronounced: Kha (Like J in Jose in Spanish) Tayn Taa-Ree-Ka.Khateyn means: Two Lines. It is the plural of Khat, which means one line. Theyare invisible to the naked eye. The Rouhaniyiin nicknamed Khateyn “Tarik alHayat”, meaning the road of life. These two lines determine how healthy,successful and balanced you are or will be in your life, in this physicaldimension. More information on this topic will follow.Tarika means a path, a road. It is usually linked to your present and future,with major impact on your health, business, spirituality, physical strength,successes, and relationships.Khateyn Tarika is a very complex and sophisticated concept, difficult tounderstand or to accept, unless you are one of the “Illuminated Masters”, or theinitiated ones (Students and adepts). But I will try to explain this concept asmuch as I can, in very simple language. Before I do that, I want to let you knowthat Khateyn Tarika is directly linked to your “Double”, astral body, your mind,your “Fik’r”, spirits and entities who live here on Earth, and in otherdimensions. III. Explaining the Concept: a- Position and place of the two lines:All of us, big and small, lucky and unlucky, rich and poor, famous, infamous andunknown, are conditioned and influenced by two invisible etheric lines thatexist either ahead of our body, behind it, or around it.And the position and placement of these two lines that we cannot see –unless wewere taught how to find them– have a major impact on everything we do, and thinkabout. b- The perfect alignment:If the two lines are aligned perfectly in parallel position to your body, yourbrain, or more precisely your intellect will produce magnificent deeds, and youwill be able to accomplish things, people thought impossible. Not only that, butyou will acquire astonishing speed that allows you to complete tasks, usuallyrequiring much more time and effort. And in some instances, you will be capableof accomplishing multiple tasks, simultaneously, and in certain conditions,INSTANTLY! c- The mixed-up alignment:If the two lines are mixed up –meaning not aligned as two parallel lines on theright side and left side of your body, and/or situated behind you, or way aheadof you– your potentials will be limited, and your accomplishments will beminimal.Consequently, you will not flourish. Many people live, exist, and do thingsoutside the lines. They work hard, long hours, they sweat, and yet, theirefforts remain in vain. This failure is caused by the misalignment of the twolines. But there is a way to rectify the situation. In this section of the book,I will explain to you how to do it, and how to maintain a perfect alignment,both mentally and physically. d- The weak and blurry alignment:If the two lines are barely defined, your health will deteriorate rapidly, andyour finances will crumble. You will fail miserably in your relationships andrapports with others, and all your resources will dry up. IV. Inside the two lines:Inside the two lines is the perfect place to be. This is the zone of verysuccessful and healthy people. This zone is harmonious with your environment,and the multiple layers of everything that surrounds you. It is a magical andincomprehensible zone, full of surprises and possibilities. It is the zone ofsubatomic particles, the extension of your “Conduit”, the realm of your“Double”, and above all your true mental and bio-organic identity.It is also the zone of visions, apparitions, alternate realities, fantasy,meta-reality, metalogic, and your rendez-vous with entities and “presences”. Theilluminated masters live and do things “between the lines.” They are neveroutside of the lines, or “out-of-line”. I hear you now telling yourself, “It isso confusing, all these words, dimensions, and bla-bla-bla words are Chinese tome…mumbo jumbo stuff…etc.” But that is not it.It is simply a new concept you are not yet familiar with. If you are patient,and if you give me the time to explain it to you, you will understand to acertain degree what I am talking about! V. You, your body, the bodies of others, entities and spirits, and KhateynTarika:For now, we are going to call Khateyn Tarika “The Zone”.To make you understand this concept, and to render your zone healthy andwell-balanced, I have to explain to you 5 important factors, and which are:> • Vis-à-vis your physical body’s zone.> • People entering your zone.> • Entities and spirits entering your zone.> • Entering other people’s zone.> • Adjusting your zone, meaning bringing equilibrium and awareness to your> zone. a. Vis-à-vis your physical body’s zone:Your body has two spaces.One, is the physical space that it occupies. Usually defined and limited by yourheight, size and weight. The other, is a space you don’t see. It is an extensionof your physical body. This extension does exist, even though you are not awareof it. So, where is it?It starts from a quarter of a centimeter from your physical body and extends upto 5 feet, in some cases up to 6 feet, in front of your body, and encompasses adistance of 4 feet on both sides of your body (Left and right), and a distanceof 4 feet behind your body. So we have here, 6 feet in front, 4 feet in therear, and 4 feet to the left and right. This is your zone. This zone stays withyou for the rest of your life. In this zone, you find your “Double”, your astralbody, your “Space memory”, your aura, and your physical-non-physical emotions. Does it increase or decrease?Yes! It does! And everything depends on the place and position your bodyoccupies between Khateyn Tarika (The two lines). You should keep your bodywell-aligned within these two lines. This means, that the two lines shouldalways remain parallel to each other, straight as an arrow, and your body shouldbe situated at an equal distance from each line, on the left and on the right. What causes the zone to shrink or extend?Shrinking or extending your zone is not healthy, mentally and physically. Evilthoughts, fear, envy, jealousy, hate, suspicions, greed, bad hygiene, worriesabout finances, trauma caused by losing a job, health problems, addiction todrugs, alcohol and similar substances jeopardize the stability of the two lines,disorient your body, and consequently push the two lines far away from yourbody.When these two lines are at a distance exceeding 6 feet ahead of you, they willinstantly lose their parallel alignment. And when this happens, your body is nolonger protected. Yes! The two lines are your shield. Once, they are no longerclose to your body, all sorts of things will invade your zone. In other words,you have lost your mental-etheric-metaphysical immune system. This loss willautomatically affect your brain, your “Conduit”, you creativity, and above allyour judgment! The two lines are your invisible non-physical guardians. Once youlose your guardians, your non-physical body, which is a copy of your physicalbody, becomes a “Vagabond”, as stated by Allamah Mouhtaram Kemal Agha. He meant,that your body is on its own, and no longer guided by your brain.Your unprotected body will do ridiculous things, and in some situations, willexpose you to imminent danger. For instance, your unprotected body will wake youup in the middle of the night, and make you walk in your sleep, in an erraticmanner, and do things a rational person would not do. The problem with thissituation, is the fact that you remain totally unaware of what is happening. Inthese situations you can hurt yourself. It is during this very stage, unwanted“presences” and entities will interfere to misguide you, to disorient you, andinfluence your subconscious mind, decisions, and actions.According to the Allamah and Rouhaniyiin, if these occurrences are frequent,your mind will fall prey to illusions and visions created by the entities.Some have called these mishaps, “Possessed by the evil spirits”, others havedescribed these unpleasant incidents as “Being totally commanded by a sick andunbalanced Double.” Allamah Moukhtar Al Ansari said verbatim, “In some cases,the Double of other people manifests itself to add more confusion to your mind,and distract your body.”Personally, I have witnessed similar events. A friend of mine who sleptovernight at my home, woke up around 2:00 in the morning, started to walk in hissleep all over the place, went to the library bookcase, and began to arrangebooks on the shelves, threw some on the floor, and ended up rolling one bottleof wine across the floor to the kitchen. He grabbed a bottle, emptied it in amatter of minutes, and hid it under the kitchen sink. A few seconds later, hestarted to scream and bounce in all directions.And then I heard him saying: “Go away…stay away from me. You hurt me enough! Iam no longer a child!” Apparently, he was talking to the Double of his motherwho manifested it’s presence as a holographic projection, in the form of awicked woman dancing like an African witch outside his own Khateyn Tarika. Thisevent happened twice before my own eyes. The very next day, my friend accused meof drinking the whole bottle of wine and hiding it under the kitchen sink!!Then, when I told him about the wicked woman who invaded his zone while he wassleep walking, he said: “Who was it? Was it my mother?”According to the Sahiriin, my friend was lucky, because at that critical moment,no malevolent spirits invaded his Khateyn Tarika. VI. Possessed by the Spirits:As long as you keep your two lines in harmony, and not far from your body, andas long as you maintain an anchored and well-balanced position of your bodybetween the two lines, no spirit will ever invade your zone. And no entity willever haunt you and/or manipulate your mind. According to Kitab Al Arwaah (TheBook of Spirits), spirits, malevolent entities and unwanted Arwaah will neverenter the bodies of human beings who have well-aligned Khateyn Tarika. It isonly when they are out-of-line, that possession by entities becomes possible.When the two lines deviate, evil spirits invade your zone and take possession ofyour body and mental faculties.Many have killed while sleep-walking, and never realized what they have done.Psychiatrists and psychologists came up with all sorts of explanations, andsuggested an avalanche of therapies and treatments, but unfortunately, as mentalhealth records show, they remained in vain, and their elaborate explanationswere never convincing. Some court records and transcripts tell of people whohave committed crimes while sleep-walking, who were acquitted, because they werefound temporarily insane, and thus not legally responsible for their actions.The Allamah see the situation quite differently.They contribute these frightening events to the “displacement” of KhateynTarika, which of course is ridiculed by scientists in the West, and the clergy.Yet, men of the cloth, publicly admit that evil spirits and the Devil couldeasily enter the human body, and possess all our faculties. And how do they dealwith this situation? Exorcism.The Rouhaniyiin and Sahiriin think otherwise. In their opinion, only there-alignment of Khateyn Tarika, will solve the problem, and expunge anymalevolent exterior (External) intervention and possession. Is this typical spirits possession of the human body?Yes it is, according to the Rouhaniyiin and Sahiriin. And it is called“Intisakhah”. Some Intisakhah are temporary, others could last for a very longperiod of time. Some occur during a séance, others while the Khateyn Tarika areunbalanced, and distant from the human body. New age ufology called theseentities who enter the human bodies, “walk-ins.”Anunnaki-Ulema Rabbi Mordachai ben Zvi told me that our third dimension (Earth)is surrounded by time-space pockets that open and close at some particularmoments.During these phases, entities of all sorts, living-forms, particles, sub-atomicparticles, “time bubbles” as well as gravity from parallel dimensions couldenter our world, and take on different shapes and forms. Afrit and Arwaah are noexception. In fact, what we have witnessed in the case of our “flying-hoveringfriend” is one of those moments, when an entity enters our dimension without aformal request. The entity starts to look for people whose “Double” is sufferingfrom lack of harmony and synchronization.These people become the target of the entity. And unfortunately, the entity willkeep on revisiting these people, as often as possible, and finally the entitysucceeds in creating a niche in their Khateyn Tarika. Those who have had atroubled childhood are particularly vulnerable, and if their Khateyn Tarikabecomes periodically distant from their body, the entities’ visits become morefrequent. VII. People entering your zone:Just like entities and spirits, others (Human beings) can also invade your zone.They enter your Khateyn Tarika through their “Double”. Siblings and children whohad an unpleasant relationship/rapport with their parents, especially with theirmothers, suffer from this Double’s invasion, more frequently than others.Allamah Sharaf Al Diin stated verbatim: “Some people could become more annoyingthan spirits.Usually, it is the Atmashabah of the mother who invades the zone of her adultchildren. Because there is a permanent link between mother and child, the Doubleof the mother could easily enter between the two lines of the child’s zone,especially when the Double of the child has left an empty place between thesetwo lines. This happens, when the Double has been kicked out by misalignment ofKhateyn Tarika.”A very disturbing scenario takes place in this situation. It is quite common tosense the Atmashabah of the mother screaming at her child, and the childreacting very aggressively toward what he/she conceives to be his/her realmother manifesting in the flesh. VIII. What is Atmashabah?Atmashabah is composed of two words found in Ana’kh, the language of theAnunnaki, in Ulemite, the language of the Anunnaki-Ulema, in the language of theSahiriin, and in Arabic.Atma means darkness. Shabah means a ghost, a phantom. Thus, the general meaningis the darkness of a ghost. Darkness of a ghost is a metaphoricexpression/interpretation for the grayish gluey substance that constitutes themanifestation of a ghost.Some spiritists call it ectoplasma. But the word ectoplasma is not quitecorrect. In ancient times, ecto was understood and written as exo, meaning outof, outside, and is of Greek origin. It refers to a substance that exits fromthe orifices of the human body (Nose, mouth, eyes). But what we have here, isnot a substance that comes out of the body, but a substance that isindependently produced by the Double of another person, without using human bodyorifices. Entities and spirits entering your zone.Entering other people’s zone:If others can enter your zone, so you too can enter the zone of other people.This happens when your Double escapes for a short time. Your Double can enter somany places on Earth, as well as in adjacent and parallel dimensions. I havewritten extensively on this subject in my previous books, and I am not about torepeat myself in this present tome. But briefly and rapidly let me point out thefollowing: A healthy Double can be guided and instructed to explore many zonesand various spheres of existence, and bring back a wealth of information on allsorts of things, objects, people and places. A Double that has been “kicked out”of your Khateyn Tarika is worthless. It would annoy others, and disrupt theharmonious flow and flux of their zones.This means that you (with your Double bouncing all around everywhere but withinyour two lines of Khateyn Tarika) would unnerve or perturb the harmonious energyof others. People would say “something about his/her energy/vibe isoff-putting.” IX. Technique for cleansing and strengthening your Khateyn TarikaHow to use it?Follow these instructions: Time and place:1. Favorable time: Always after 9:00 PM.2. Favorable place: Any place as long as you are alone and not disturbed byothers. Preparation:1. Draw two parallel lines on the floor.2. The length of the two lines should not exceed 7 feet.3. The six feet are your zone.The additional foot limits the outer strength of your zone, usually used forreinforced protection.4. The space between the two parallel lines should not exceed 5 feet.5. Light and place one white candle at the end of each line. So, you should have2 lit candles at the end of your zone defined by the length of the two lines.6. Now, look around you, and pick up 4 objects, anything you like, a pen, abracelet, a small cup, a piece of chocolate, whatever you have access to.7. Dump the 4 objects in a paper bag.8. Write the name of each object on a piece of paper and place the paper in asecond bag.9. Keep the two bags outside the two lines.10. Put down the bags in any place you want.11. There are no restrictions, as long as they are outside the two lines. The process:> • 1. First of all, in your mind, you should envisage now, the two lines of> Khateyn Tarika as the borderlines of everything that contains you as a person;> this, consists of the time you live in, the time you have lived in, the good> time you knew, the hard time you went through, and what you do believe might> prevent you from progressing in life.> • 2. The 4 objects you have already picked up might seem irrelevant to what> you are currently thinking about, and/or the situation you are going through.> • 3. I can explain to you right away how important and relevant those 4> objects are, but this could influence your thoughts and spoil the esoteric> exercise. So, do not get preoccupied with these objects. Forget about them for> the time being.> • 4. Get a rope or a thread and tie 4 knots on the rope or the thread.> • 5. Later on, and on your own you will understand the relation and/or the> link that exists between the 4 objects and the 4 knots.> • 6. In this context, each knot could or would represent 4 important things in> your life. I asked you to select 4 objects, not less and not more, simply> because I do not want you to think about many things for now, because you> should keep your mind focused on a few things.> • 7. And fewer objects might not gather and/or cover enough stuff. So 4> objects are more than enough to practice the Khateyn Tarika.> • 8. Now you have a rope or a thread with 4 knots. Lay down the rope or the> thread on the floor, any place you want, as long as it is inside the two> lines.> • 9. The 4 knots represents 4 periods in your life. You may not agree with> this interpretation, because you might think that you have never lived 4> periods.> • 10. True, but according to the enlightened masters, all of us have already> lived or will go through 4 phases in our lives. Some periods or passages are> pleasant; others are tough or uncomfortable to say the least.> • 11. Some passages you might remember, others you are not aware of, or simply> you do not remember, because they are buried in your childhood, or yet to> surface in your future. But eventually, they will become part of the fabric of> your life in the present and in the future..> • 12. Some people have more problems than others. Consequently, more knots are> required. But if we keep on thinking in this manner, we will never finish the> practice. Later on, as you progress with your practice, you can add as many> knots as you want. If you add more than 4 knots, you should ask the assistance> of a Master.> • 13. Do not complicate things, work with only 4 knots for now. It is more> than you can handle, especially if you are a beginner.> • 14. Lay down on the floor, inside the two lines, and close your eyes. Keep> your eyes close until the end of the exercise.> • 15. Now, start to focus on one knot; the first one on the rope or the> thread.> • 16. Call this first knot, your childhood.> • 17. While you are positioning yourself on the floor, between the two lines,> try to remember something from your childhood.> • 18. Do not worry about what you should remember and what part of your> childhood you should remember. Anything that pops up in your head will be just> fine. Later on, your mind will sort out and resort things accordingly.> • 19. Well, let’s assume that your mind will take you back into your past when> you were 4 year old. That’s fine. Now start to remember what you liked and> disliked when you were 4 years old.> • 20. See what your mind will bring back to your memory. Are you seeing the> old house you lived in? Maybe now, you are seeing neighbors, the school bus,> your teachers, siblings? It does not matter what you are seeing and what you> are missing. Let your brain navigate on its own.> • 21. Try to sink yourself into those visions, and relive these passages from> your childhood.> • 22. Once you become one with your past, and your brain begins to assimilate> this, begin a conversation with the 4 year old child you used to be.> • 23. This conversation will stimulate parts or segments from your past, that> will perfectly fit the moment you are living right now, meaning that, what> your brain is currently bring back to you, is closely associated with the> knot.> • 24. And this exercise applies to the other three knots.> • 25. Now, I want you to stop reading these instructions, right here at bullet> #25, and go back to bullet #1, and start reading the instructions from the> beginning. Of course, you will not do this during the séance.> • 26. But here and now, and for the sole purpose of fully understanding the> process, I am asking you to re-read the instructions from the beginning.> Welcome back. Now, here you are talking peacefully to yourself when you were 4> year old. Continue to do so by asking the child standing before you to take> you back in time to a place you liked very much; it could be the beach, an old> house, a play-ground, your grand mother home, any thing.> • 27. Anchor yourself in the place you are revisiting. Let your memory and> mind float freely.> • 28. And while you are revisiting and reliving that place and that moment> from your past, ask calmly the child (Remember, this child is YOU!) standing> before you to tell you why did he/she like that place?> • What is so special about that place?> • 29. Ask the child about something less pleasant, for instance something that> has disturbed you, and/or scared you. It could be anything, a sad event, a> painful experience, something like that.> • 30. Wait for the answer, and see how you are going to feel all over again.> This sensation will come.> • 31. If you re-experience the same feeling you had years ago, this would be> an indication, a sign that you have linked yourself to a past event.> • 32. Now, using your imagination, try to project that unpleasant event, right> before your eyes. Use the power of your mind, or simply convince yourself that> part of your Symetric Mind is activated.> • 33. Then, tell yourself you are going to tie up that event inside the first> knot. And while you are doing this, think about a dark color, any color you> want. I recommend dark blue.> • 34. In your first séance, you will concentrate on one knot, and you will tie> the pertaining event (Memory of event) inside one knot; the corresponding knot> that is. This exercise shall be repeated for the other knots in forthcoming> séances.> • 35. Now, you tell your mind to concentrate on your feet. More precisely on> your two big toes, simultaneously. Repeat this, until your toes are totally> relaxed.> • 36. Tell your toes to go to sleep. Keep telling your toes to do so, until> you start to feel that both toes are now cold and heavy.> • 37. Now tell your feet to go to sleep. Keep telling your feet to do so,> until you start to feel that your feet are now cold and heavy.> • 38. As you progress in your exercise, you will get better and faster> results.> • 39. Now reach for you knees and do the same thing.> • 40. It could take you several attempts to realize this, but eventually you> will succeed, if you persevere.> • 41. Once, your knees, your feet, and your toes have reached the state of> numbness, you will begin to feel the presence of two lines emanating from the> right side and left side of your hip. And that is fine.> • 42. Now, you ask the child standing before you to lift you up.> • 43. Your body will start to rise.> • 44. In less than two seconds, you will start to float in the air. And you> will begin to hover over your own body.> • 45. No, you are not dreaming, and you are not under the influence of any> mental disillusion. What is happening here is real. It is mental, not> physical. Your brain is in charge now of the whole situation. It is not an> out-of-the body experience. It is not an astral projection.> • 46. It is the mind which is producing this effect.> • 47. At this precise moment, ask the child who is still standing in front of> you, to take you to the place you have chosen for revisiting your childhood.> • 48. Tell your mind to pick up the rope or the thread and to throw it in the> air.> • 49. Grab the rope or the thread and shake it strongly and firmly.> • 50. Take the rope or the thread with you to your chosen destination (The> place, country or time you have chosen to revisit).> • 51. As soon as you have reached your destination, ask your mind to untie the> knot.> • 52. Your mind is extremely powerful. You mind can do it. And soon, you will> see the rope or the thread folding and unfolding on itself, and the knot> disappearing.> • 53. It is not an illusion, because when you return to the body which is> still lying down and flat inside the Khateyn Tarika, you will discover that> the rope or the thread has now only three knots.> • 54. Thank the child who accompanied you in your fantastic journey in time> and space.> • 55. Descend slowly into your physical body. Your mind will re-enter its> original place, and your brain will re-adjust itself.> • 56. You will loose the dumbness you have felt before, and before you know> it, your knees, feet and toes will regain their normal/natural senses.> • 57. You will wake up, healthy and content, but you will not remember> everything you felt or witnessed.> • 58. Your eyes are wide open now.> • 59. Look at the rope or the thread you left inside the two lines.> • 60. And to your great amazement, you will find out that the rope or the> thread has only three knots now. And that is wonderful, because you got rid of> a knot which was blocking many wonderful things from happening in your life.> • 61. There is one more wonderful surprise for you; look inside the bag where> you have dumped the four objects you have selected. What you will see is> self-explanatory.> • 62. You have made a most unusual and successful trip to another dimension.> Your two lines are now re-aligned perfectly, and you are now in perfect> harmony and sync with your Double.> • 63. This is an experience you will remember for the rest of your life.> • 64. Do not expect to succeed right away, but eventually you will without any> doubt, if you believe in yourself, in the power of your mind, and in the magic> of your imagination. It will work for you if you practice and practice and> practice. The process becomes much easier, if you know how to use your> Supersymetric Mind.> • 65. You can repeat the same exercise for the remaining three knots, until> you get rid of each knot which is blocking your life.> • 66. One knot at the time. One séance at the time. One exercise at the time.> • 67. Once all knots/blocks are removed, your Khateyn Tarika lines will become> a formidable protection shield, and a magnificent source of energy, strength> and mental enlightenment.> > [Image00004.gif] PART 6 HealingEnergyPositive VibesNegative VibesAura"},{"pageContent":"Baaniradu TechniqueThe healing touch technique I. DefinitionIII. Prerequisites and preparationII-The techniqueStage onePreparation for stage twoStage twoStage threeThe technique I. Definition:Baaniradu is the Anunnaki-Ulema term for the healing touch technique. It wasfirst used by the priests of Melkart in Ancient Phoenicia, Ugarit and Arwad. Itis extremely important to bear in mind, that this technique does not in anyshape or form replace any scientific and medical treatment (s). Baaniradu hasnot been fully explored and used in the West. I. Prerequisites and Preparation > • 1 -Before you learn how to heal, you should know first if you can heal, and> if you have the power to heal without learning.> • 2- Training and learning will show you the way, but not necessarily the> blessing of healing others.> • 3- Training will teach you the techniques of healing by touch and/or healing> without touching. But success depends on the quality and quantity of the> healing power you have in your “Conduit”.> • 4 -Also you have to remember that if you are intoxicated, or under the> influence of drugs, medicine, pills, addictive substances, narcotics,> caffeine, tobacco and similar substances, you will not be able to heal others.> • 5 -If your body is not clean, you will not be able to heal others. Your> hands most be sparkling clean all the time.> • 6 -If you have been sick yourself for the past 40 days, you will not be able> to heal others.> • 7 -If you have committed an act of violence, perjury, false testimony,> adultery, theft and/or any hideous act (For the past 2 years), you will not be> able to heal others. However, if you have been purified by the Ulema, and if> you have fully compensated others (Humans and animals) for all the damages,> losses, hurting, pain and suffering> you have caused them, your chances of healing will increase considerably.> • 8 -Do not come close to a sick person, and do not attempt to heal a sick> person, if you have sinned in action and in thought. Only, when you are pure> in heart and mind you can do so.Because you will be generating a strong energy current with your hands, you haveto keep in mind three important things:a -Do not rotate both hands in opposite directions over one area of the sickbody.b -Do not use physical strength in moving your hands;c -Do not constantly concentrate on one particular area of the sick body. Workaround it as the healing touch progresses. *** *** ***> • 1- Our bodies were created to heal themselves.> • 2- Our bodies were programmed from the time we were born.> • 3- We cannot change what was written in our “Essence” (Similar to DNA).> • 4- But we can improve on it.> • 5- Our bodies consist of many things, including mental memory, physical> memory, spatial memory, and etheric memory.> • 6- Each memory has its own health condition, limitation and sphere.> • 7- We can be sick in one sphere, and perfectly healthy in another.> • 8- The mental affects the physical, and vice versa.> • 9- We can overcome mental and physical difficulties and disturbances by> balancing our physical state (Physical milieu) with our mental sphere (Astral> and/or non-physical dimension, also called Zinnar (Etheric Belt surrounding> our body).> • 10- This helps a lot. Because when we feel pain in certain part of our body,> this part can be transposed into the Zinnar sphere for self-healing.> • 11- Once it is healed, this part will return to its physical origin. This is> an exercise/technique only the Ulema can accomplish. But students like you can> heal the painful part of your body without transposing it into a non-physical> sphere. You can heal that part with “Talamouth” (A gentle synchronized> energetic touch), and “Tarkiz” (Even without touching the suffering part, and> simply by directing beam of energy from the brain’s cell “Conduit”).> • 12- You have to consider your body as a battery, or like an electrical> current. Both have negative and positive terminals. Your body too, has a> positive area, and a negative area.> • 13- Some individuals have negative terminal in the left side of their> bodies, and a positive terminal in the right side of their bodies. Others,> just the opposite.> • 14- Thus, it is very important to discern between the two terminals, and> know where exactly the negative and the positive terminals or stations are> located within the body.> • 15- If you don’t know how to localize these two terminals, and you try to> heal a sick person, you could disorient the energy in his body and cause> severe injuries.> • 16- A well-trained student knows how to find these two terminals by dowsing,> using his both hands as rods.> • 17- Before you start dowsing, you have to know upfront, which one of your> hands is positive, and which one of your hands is negative.> • 18- If you don’t know, and you begin with your healing touch process, you> could disorient the energy flux in the body of the sick person, and cause> severe damages to his health.> • 19- If your right hand has a positive charge, then this hand should “hover”> over the positive terminal of the sick person.> • 20- If your right hand has a negative charge, then this hand should “hover”> over the negative terminal of the sick person.> • 21- The same thing applies to the other hand.> • 22- You should not wear jewelry or metal during the healing touch therapy.> • 23- You should not perform the healing touch therapy nearby an electrical> outlet.> • 24- You should not perform the healing touch therapy nearby pets, because> pets sense diseases, illness and negative energy. They are vulnerable to these> conditions and could absorb their frequencies and vibes, thus disrupting the> healing process.> • 25- Do not come too close to the body of the sick person. Keep at least 20> centimeters of distance between yourself and the sick person.> • 26 -You should stop your healing touch immediately if you notice that the> sick person is having trouble breathing. The healing touch training requires patience, perseverance, practice, and time.Usually, to complete the training program, a student spends at least 3 monthsstudying and practicing. In some instances, the period could stretch to 6months. Everything depends on the personal effort and commitment of the Talmiz(Student). There are several steps to follow. And here they are:Your hands are an extension of your mind. Use them wisely and for the good ofmankind. Talk to your hands. Explore them. Get to know them. Find out what theycan do, and try to discover how many beautiful things they can create.

Definition> • II. Case study> • Employees in the United States> • III. How to stop attracting negative people to your life. How to block> negative vibes> • IV. The Ulema technique to block negative vibes and bad thoughts aimed at> you, your business, and your health I. Definition:Bisho-barkadari “Bukadari” is the Anunnaki-Ultma term for the technique used inblocking bad vibes that negatively affect human beings.It is composed from two words:a -Bisho, which means bad; negative.b -Barkadari, which means flames; rays, vibes; beams. Negativity is atrociously destructive. It affects your mind, your body, yourrelationships with others, and your very environment. Negativity comes fromthree sources:1 -Others; their thoughts, intentions, and actions,2 -Yourself; your thoughts, intentions, and deeds,3 -Your environment; where and how you live.> • Thoughts can take a physical form.> • Thoughts can materialize in physical and non-physical dimensions.> • Enlightened ones can project and materialize healthy and positive thoughts.> • Deviated and succumbed seers can project, emanate and materialize negative> and destructive thoughts.> • Bad and destructive thoughts directed toward you or against you can harm> your mental and physical abilities, as well as your health, your progress, and> your environment, including your home, your office, your car, and any place> where you live and work.> • Malicious seers can either target your “Double” (Astral Body) and/or your> physical body.> • They can also send harmful vibrations to your mind, to your body, and to the> objects you touch, including tools, materials, equipments and instruments you> use, such as a computer, a camera, a car, an elevator, a desk, even a> can-opener. We will talk about all this in due time.> • These bad vibes can be intentional or unintentional.> • They are intentional when they are sent by others to harm you.> • They are unintentional when you discover or when you sense them on your own.> In this situation, you can take an immediate action to stop their negative> effects on you.> • For instance, you walk into a room or you mingle with people in a social> gathering, and all of a sudden, you feel uncomfortable or disturbed in the> presence of one or more individuals.> • You get the feeling that you are not at ease being around them, or something> is bothering you about a particular person or a group of people. Usually, you> get this feeling toward a particular person who has just passed by you, or> looking at you, or just standing by.> • Sometimes you know what is bothering you about this guy, and sometimes you> don’t. Don’t think much. Don’t philosophize about it. You can stop this> disturbing feeling on the spot. And I am going to show you how.> • But first, you must understand what has created this unpleasant and> irritating feeling, and caused a negative current to circulate around you.> • Since this unpleasant feeling you have sensed was not intentionally created> by others to hurt you, no serious harm will come to you.> • But if you do not stop it right away, it could cause further discomfort and> additional nuisances.> • The person who has created this negative current around you is usually> unaware of it. It is beyond his/her control.> • In most cases, the unpleasant vibes you felt toward that person, and the> negativity you sensed are created by one or all of the following factors:unhealthy vibrations.b -The person’s diet; the quantity of unhealthy food and addictive substanceshe/she absorbed.c -The temper and character of the person; if he/she is a bitter and unhappyindividual, the disharmonious and unbalanced frequencies of his/her unhappinessand bitterness will hit your Double, the perimeter of your aura, and all yoursensorial faculties.Those frequencies are charged with negative energy usually diffused throughgrayish rays undetected to the naked eyes, but could be seen, detected andanalyzed in laboratories.This is factual. In many instances, these negative vibrations can prevent yourmachines and equipments from working properly. All of a sudden, your computercrashes, your car does not start, your cellular phone is dead, your TV is shutoff, and many of your electrical gadgets stop working. All these weird thingshappen while that person is around you.Do not get frustrated. Do not lose your temper. Soon, everything will be justfine. In the following chapter, you will learn how to block negative vibes.Two situations to deal with:How many times did you tell yourself or others? I can’t work when my roommate is in the apartment. I can’t write when she is around! He drained me out completely! I feel nervous when he is around and everything stops working. I had to wait until he leaves before I could start working again. He gives me the creeps. Basically, you have two situations to deal with:1-Situation #1: What you should and could do if you can control your environmentor place;2-Situation #2: What you should and could do if you can’t control yourenvironment or place.It is paramount to understand how the energy field surrounding you, andemanating from others plays a paramount role in conditioning and affecting yourmind and your health. You can’t measure it or see it with your naked eyes, butmost certainly you have felt it many times. Everything around you can affectyou. It can even affect your luck, fortune and business. Master B. Ushah was soright when he said that the energy field can be thought of as a grid of finelines which run crisscross throughout the whole universe and through everyliving being, thereby connecting every part of creation to each other.Wherever you go, you become part of the environment, even part of a street sign,and people crossing the street. The Ulema call this energy field “Ih-tikah’k”,meaning contact with others on different plane. Western teachers refer to it asAura, based upon Eastern traditions. This energy field (Ih-tikaah’k or Aura) isthe electromagnetic field surrounding an object, including yourself, yourfriends and foes; even your pets.It surrounds all living things such as people, plants and animals as well asnon-living things such as rocks. These fields change with time, sometimeswithout warning, due to various positive and more often negative influences.This field surrounds and runs through the body, holding within it informationwhich reflects the current physical mental and emotional condition of theindividual. It also contains the original \"blueprint\" of health. The humanenergy field is part of the life force energy field and is like a template ornetwork of energy points with which the physical molecules of the body arealigned. As noted by B. Ushah.The Ulema said that the field, within and outside of our bodies storesinformation including our thoughts, past and present. This energetic systemcomprises of several layers such as:1-You physical body2-Others’ physical bodies,3-You Double,4-Others’ Double,5-Your electro-magnetic vibes,6-Others’ electro-magnetic vibes,7-Your astral blueprints,8-Others’ astral blueprints,9-Your Chakras,10-Others’ Chakras,11-Your meridians,12-Others’ meridians,13-Your past, present and future,14-Others’ past, present and future,15-Your Conduit (Active or dormant),16-Others’ Conduit (Active or dormant). Our personal energy field is in constant contact with the outside world becauseit is part of it:> • It absorbs slow frequencies from electrical equipment,> • It collects other people's negative energies,> • It stores the memory of upsetting interactions with others,> • It carries the memory of our past illness, distress and life experience, as> noted by B. Ushah. II. Case study:Employees in the United States:Contemporary Ulema have found that negative vibrations and transmission ofnegative energy rays vary in intensity and degree of harm in virtue of manyfactors.1 -In the United States, negative and bitter people are more likely to emitnegative energy that can deeply affect you mentally andphysically on Monday and on Tuesday than on any other days of the week.2 -Employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs and who dislike their bossdiffuse intense bad vibes during the early and late hours of the day of theirshifts.3 -These vibes become more intense upon returning home, and especially duringthe first 40 minutes.4 -The negative vibes dissipate short after, however their sub-conscienceretains their dissatisfaction and anger for the rest of the day.5 -Thus, the Ulema suggest that you give those people enough room to relax andenough time to forget about the job they hate before you discuss with them anydelicate or sensitive matter, because they will explode.6 -It is highly recommended to have pets around depressed and tired people. Petsprovide therapeutic and curing vibes. However, if these people are going throughintense rage or anger state, pets should not be left around them.7 -The negative vibes of bitter and angry people can cause damages not only tohumans and pets, but also to domestic appliances. III. How to stop attracting negative people to your life. How to block negativevibes:Master Win Li said: “There is a major difference between the Western approachand the Ulema’s technique to blocking negative vibes that can harm yourwell-being. However, Western therapists and Ulema agree on two things:1 -Negative vibes are either produced by ourselves or by others.2 -Without knowing many attract negative and destructive people to their lives.In both situations, the consequences can be disastrous. Are there techniques toblock harmful negative vibes, and to stop attracting bitter and negative peopleto our life and to what we do for a living? The answer is yes!” IV.

[Image00017.jpg] Introduction to the study of vibrations, energy and “Affected Luck”_________________ Introduction____________________________________________ Everything around you affects your life, negatively or positively, and thisincludes, pets, people, objects, plants, the way your home is designed,absolutely everything.You might not know that some people, including good buddies and friends canbring you bad luck, and prevent you from succeeding in life. This book will tellyou everything about these topics, and teach you how to change your life tobetter, and head toward success. 1-People:Some people who are filled with negativity and bitterness can even crash yourcomputer if they are around, and their negative vibes can spread and developconditions that cause your failure in many of your projects, businesses,investment, health, and/or any endeavor you are involved with.Ruhaniyiin, Sahiriin, and Anunnaki Ulema taught us that the human body is adepot of everything that constitutes a person. It is not only a physicalorganism, but a container of all aspects of a person, mentally, physically,spiritually, and metaphysically.People who hate your guts, those who envy your success, those who love to seeyou broke and miserable, and individuals who are mentally and spirituallybankrupt can cause you harm, just by thinking about hurting you.Some, know the mechanism, others don’t. *** *** *** Introduction____________________________________________ Their vicious intentions, thoughts, and wishes are stored in “Jabas” insidetheir brain, and their vibes can create “Mintaka Fasida” (Negative Zone) thatcould penetrate your “Khateyn Tarika”, and cause lots of damages.No, they are not masters of the power of mind, or great psychics. They are justbad people with strong negative vibes that you are sensible and sensitive to.Sometimes, dear friends, siblings, and relatives can do the same thing, withoutknowing, because they are not aware of the functioning of their Jabas.Their bitterness, loneliness, financial insecurity, and negativity can disruptthe normal rhythm of your life, if they are around you. This is an absolutefact. The problem we are facing here, is the fact that neither us nor them are awareof what is going on. Besides, you don’t suspect a dear friend to cause you harm!Unfortunately, it happens to us all the time.Some people who, just by entering your room, and without touching anything,doing anything, or saying anything, can blow up your oven, freeze your computer,and even damage your health.Their negative vibes are causing all this.You should be very careful when you are around people, and vice-versa. You needa protection shield that prevents their vibes from entering your “Own Zone”,mentally and physically. 2-Where you live:Something else you should be concerned with: The area where you live. There areareas, zones, spots and places charged with underground negative currents thatkill any opportunity to succeed in any project of yours, and would/could bring aseries of failures to your life.Some areas and neighborhoods are good for you, others awfully bad, foreverything you do, including your health, relations with others, work andanything related to your present and future.You should know about these positive and negative zones, places, andneighborhoods.Introduction____________________________________________ In this book, I tried to summarize the locations of these areas. I will not giveyou the precise names and locations of streets and zones, because I do not wantto cause a mass panic, or get into troubles with local organizations,neighborhoods’ committees, developers, and official authorities.However, I will give you a list of states that fall into any of the foresaidcategories. Also, I will provide you with maps reflecting the undergroundpositive and negative currents that have major effects on you and your life ingeneral. 3-Do you feel unlucky?Many feel unlucky, and they don’t know why?They try hard to come up with something that could change their lives to better,feel secure, but they always fail, despite their hard efforts, good intentions,and perseverance. No matter what they do, there is no light at the end of thetunnel?How do we explain this?Is it bad luck?Bad karma?Bad planning?The wrong time?The wrong place?Or something else? I will explore with you all the possibilities and scenarios.But one thing is sure; there are “Knots” in your life that must be removed rightaway from the “Thread of your life.”Something has already been written in the book of your life. The Anunnaki Ulemacall it “Maktoob”, meaning what is written for your future. How to deal and cope with Maktoob?Are there techniques and practices to remove the knots of bad luck?Yes, there is!And, I will show you step-by-step how to do it.Also, what about the “17 lucky years” and “7 unlucky years” in your life?Introduction____________________________________________ Are you aware of that?Well, the Rouhaniyiin and the Anunnaki-Ulema told us that each one of us will gothrough periods (weeks, months, years) that are either lucky or unlucky, andhave an enormous effect on everything we do.During the bad period, we should not –for instance– invest, create a newbusiness, get involved with something or somebody, or take a major decisionconcerning a job, relocation and other important matters.And there are the good years in our lives, where everything blooms, andeverything we touch will “turn into gold.”We will discover these years and moments in our lives that have determined ourfate and/or will shape our future. And yes, in this book, I will provide youwith several pertinent techniques and exercises. 4-Good timing and bad timing:We know from the Anunnaki Ulema Dirasaat and Kiraat, that our lives areconditioned and regulated by a Rizmanah; a sort of macro-micro-human-cosmiccalendar that contains all events, situations, circumstances, positions,locations, (Past, present and future) that will shape our lives, fate, destiny,future and luck. There are good days, and there are bad days.There are happy hours, and there are sad hours. There is a time to cry andmourn, and there is time to rejoice and celebrate. You already know that.But what you didn’t know is this: There are days and hours that could bringfailure and even catastrophic results, if you conduct your business, travel,invest, start a new project, relocate, and so on, during those days and thosehours.And fortunately, there are good days and good hours to start a new business,meet new friends, partners, soul-mates, and make decisions on serious matters. The bad and good days and hours are clearly written inside the Rizmanah. So, youhave to check out the Rizmanah.Each one of us has a personal Rizmanah.No two Rizmanahs are alike.Introduction____________________________________________ In the book, I have provided you with a basic format of the Rizmanah, pertinentsquares, and numbers you can use to figure out your good days and hours. 5-Your name:Oh yes! Your name plays a major role in your life. I am not referring to fancynames, aristocratic names or Hilly-Billy names. I am talking about the powersand weaknesses contained in your surname.Each letter in your name has something to do with your future, and the place youoccupy in this world. Did you know that you have another name given to youbefore you were born?Yes sir!A name not given to you by parents, and relatives.But by those who created you!You will read about this fascinating subject in this book. 6-The Great Awakening:You pump iron to develop your muscles.How about your brain’s muscles?And, what do you do to increase the size and capabilities of your mind? Well,there are lots of techniques you can use to develop the powers of your mind.Although, they are metaphysical and esoteric, the results are equally mental andphysical.I have provided you in this book with several exercises, lessons and techniquesthat could bring a “Great Awakening” to your mind and Supersymetric Mind. Theyare easy to follow, assuming that you invest in your quest, perseverance,patience, and belief in yourself. Once your mind is awake and entirely alert, you will discover a world withinyou, full of supernatural powers, awareness, and synchronization with two wheelsthat constitute your universe. The first wheel is the Macro Wheel, and itrepresents the cosmos you live in.The second wheel is the Micro Wheel, and it represents you on the landscape ofthe cosmos.Introduction____________________________________________ If the two wheels are not in sync, whatever you do in your life will remain invain, and you will never accomplish anything meaningful. Consequently, mishapsand bad luck will ride with you on the roads of life.Some of the techniques and exercises that facilitate harmonious synchronizationof the two wheels include the exploration of your imagination and mentalprojection of everything that surrounds you and influence your way of life,health, business, and your future in general. You will have the opportunity tolearn these techniques; they are fun, stimulating and extra-ordinary. I welcome you to the path of knowledge, sacred hidden wisdom, enlighteningdiscoveries, and compassion.And let me remind you that in order to succeed in unlocking these secrets andmake them work for you, you should keep a warm place in your heart for all thosewho need comfort, and help everybody and anybody in any way you can, especiallythose who cannot return the favor.Without affection and compassion, without pure goodness in your heart, you willnever be able to benefit from this book.

Introduction:The globe is filled with a multitude of underground negative currents and spotsthat store and circulate negative energy.The areas, spots, and zones that store negative energy (ies) are called MarakaFasida.And, they are almost everywhere underground.The Anunnaki Ulema and Rouhaniyiin told us that there are approximately 750,000Maraka Fasida on planet Earth. Many are unidentified and/or not revealed to usby the Masters. And, they have their own reasons.People who live above these negative zones (Spots and currents) will sufferenormously in their lives. And their suffering (Physical and mental) willencompass failure in business, relationships, entrepreneurial activities,partnerships, investments, health and mental development.

Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ M[Image00066.gif] ap of United States Lucky and Unlucky ZonesNote: See explanations on the next page.Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing_[Image00067.gif] ___________________________________________ Map of United States Delicate Zones. ___________________ Explanation:A Delicate zone means one or all of the following:1-The black dots refer to states, where the level and degree of your financialsuccess and/or stability are pre-determined by circumstances and factors out ofyour control.Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ 2-Although these states are not negative in etheric structure, the vibrations oftheir milieu (People living there, and underground currents) will affect theoutcome of your efforts, planning, financial stability, and new enterprises.This does not apply to all of us, but to some individuals who are “sensitive andsensible” to the underground negative spots and currents. Many people who livein some of these states succeeded beyond belief and became millionaires, whileothers failed miserably despite their hard work, intelligence and financialresources.California, New York and Greater Washington, DC (Including two areas inMaryland) are perfect examples.You should consult your “Vibrations Personal Chart” and your Rizmanah.New Jersey is a locale/Carrefour/conglomeration for conflicting currents,meaning unpredictable results. Consequently, if you have lived in neighboringareas where their Maraka Fasida are accentuated, then, you should not move yourbusiness, or start a new project in an area or zone situated above anunderground negative current starting underground in New York. This is notfinancial advice I am giving you; and, you should not consider my explanation asa professional opinion. It is up to you, to consider the situation or disregardmy argument.Personally, I will not move my business and activities to any area, if it isdirectly linked to a negative current which originally starts and/or originatesunderground/spot/current of a state where the Maraka Fasida is strong.From consulting my “Etheric Chart”, I came to a conclusion that some streets andavenues in New York City will not be beneficial for a period of time starting in2010 and ending in 2014. Again, this is my personal reading, and you should notcategorically apply my findings to your personal situation. It is up to you.But, if I were in your position, I would seriously consider these possibilities.In New York: 19 th Street between 7 th Avenue and 8 th Avenue is not a favorablespot. There are 2 blocks on 8 th Avenue, I consider to be extremely negative.57 th Street is not a beneficial etheric locale.Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ 18 th Street between 7 th & 8 th Avenue is not good spot for people who want tosucceed in artistic careers, such as: acting, composing music and producingvideos. On 23 rd Street, near Chelsea Hotel, there are several bad luck pocketsthat could prevent many from having financial freedom. Many of the people livingthere will always struggle.Harlem area has 2 huge negative spots. 188 th Street, in Inwood, is a good spot.However, there is one bad spot in Inwood above 200 th Street, on the East side,zip code 10033 that has a few bad spots. Spiritual people can feel it as well assmell the bad vibes in the air. Its ramifications are stored in the walls of thebuildings. Two particular areas in Park Slope, Brooklyn, are to be avoided. They are badfor business and they halt your creativity.There are delicate zones on 1 st Avenue that could twist your luck. Some blocksof 1 st Avenue could catapult your success, but you have to know upfront whenyou should get out of that area.Part of Binghamton has been affected by a negative underground current.3-Some spots in delicate zones have a temporary effect, meaning that for a fewmonths or a few years, your business, personal development, peace of mind andtranquility will not be negatively affected, but at some point, you shouldrelocate to another area. Be alert, watch how things are going, revise yourplans and compare results.Create a time-table chart for all the results you are getting for a few months.Give yourself time, but observe very carefully how others who are conducting thesame business are doing on a monthly basis. *** *** *** Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________Black line: Current of negative energy.[Image00068.gif] Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ Black line: Current of negative energy. Explanation:The black line refers to a strong negative current.States located above this current are charged with Maraka Fasida strongvibrations. Florida takes the leads. Bad spots in Florida:Miami Beach,Boca Raton,Delray Beach,Panama City,Kissimmee,Boynton Beach,Marathon. In Washington, DC area (DC/Virginia/Maryland):Bad spots in Virginia:Loudoun County,Leesburg,Tysons Corner. Bad spots in Maryland:Columbia,Fell’s Point.

Thesecond current is called Ishra-Atila; it represents a negative energy. Ishra-Tamam:The map on page 56, illustrates these two currents. The gray line belongs toIshra-Tamam. It represents the current of positive energy. Ishra-Atila:The black line belongs to Ishra-Atila. It represents the current of negativeenergy. *** *** *** Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ Map of Creativity Zones in the United States.[Image00070.gif] Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ Map of Creativity Zones in the United States. ____________________ Explanation:The map on page 58 represents states, where your creativity and entrepreneurialinclination would flourish. New York takes the lead. California comes second.But you have to remember that your success in this area (Creativity) is notalways guaranteed, because New York and California are on the map of UnitedStates Delicate Zones. The Etheric Chart provides an explanation. Etheric Chart’s Explanation:Although underground currents affect (Positively and negatively) those who liveabove, people too, participate in increasing the positive and negative levels ofsuch currents.It is a two-way street.Let’s take for instance the reasons that invite and/or encourage people torelocate to another state, or more precisely, the major reason to move to aparticular state, such as New York. Almost 90% will tell you: Opportunities,more jobs, business, money and soon.And of course, lots of them will tell you: Art, culture, Broadway, musicals,museums, etc.But basically, it is the aspect of business/money, jobs and the enormousopportunities, New York offer.There is no question about it. And, that’s fine.But if you start to dig deeper into the fabric and nature of how people in bigcities and prosperous metropolitan areas, such as New York, compete with eachother, seize opportunities, market their products, package themselves, sellthemselves, and conduct their business, you will find out that (in manyinstances, almost 92%) greed, power, selfishness, deceitful practices,materialism, and compromising ethical standards, play a major role in fuelingtheir success and dominating the market. Maraka Fasida and esoteric dowsing____________________________________________ These sorts of operations, intentions, and practices contaminate the etheric andspiritual dimensions (Zones) where you, them, and newcomers live and work.Consequently, they create negative vibes and add to the destructive flux of thenegative energy current running beneath us. So, as you see, negative currentsaffect people and people with bad vibes equally affect the circulating energywhere we live. And, in New York City you will find plenty of that.This could explain why these areas are called delicate zones. However, theseareas will not stop your creativity from blooming. Nevertheless, you have toconsult your personal etheric chart, and Rizmanah upon dealing with others.The Rizmanah is also important because it shows you the good days and bad days,the good hours and bad hours to take decisions and conclude business withothers. *** *** ***Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Ikti-ChafaDiscovering the Energy of your Mind and Body___________________ I. Introduction:At the Ma’ahad, the honorable Enlightened Masters taught us several techniquesto sense and direct our energy via Ikti-Chafa exercise. In this section, I willprovide you with a very simple practice/technique that could help you discover,sense, and direct your energy.It is customary for the spiritual teachers, guides, channelers, psychics,mediums and healers to talk about that un-je-ne-sais-quoi “Energy”!But rarely, do they explain in simple terms, what that energy is!What its substance is made of?How energy is created?How energy could be sensed and directed?How to use it to create a positive environment?How to use it to block others’ negative thoughts and energy?Can we see others’ energy?Can we see our own energy?And, can we measure energy? If pertinent answers and explanations are not given to us, then, kiss goodbyethat energy, and all the mambo-jumbo lectures of the spiritual masters andso-called psychics. And, it’s as simple as that.Energy has been defined as:> • Aura,> • Astral Body,> • Vibes or rays emanated by Chakras,> • The first layer of the Double,> • The electromagnetic frequencies of substances and bio-organic elements found> in our body,> • An etheric vibration.Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Some masters in the East depicted energy as:> • Chi,> • Ki,> • Noi Cun,> • Nei-Cha,> • Inner mental-physical strength, you name it. Don’t get confuse with all these definitions. We have to simplify things tounderstand things.So, for now, let’s call energy, vibrations or frequencies produced by the Jabas,and the elements (Organic elements) found in our body.Although, they are not visible to the naked eye, true spiritual masters can seethese vibrations and frequencies, and in some instances, can be scientificallydetected and measured in the laboratory. II. Generalities:All of us have energy. Good people produce positive and good energy. Bad peopleproduce negative and bad energy.Sick people (Good or bad people) produce negative energy.Mentally disturbed people (Good or bad people) produce negative energy.Inmates (Good or bad people, innocent or guilty people) produce negative energy.Good people who temporarily display anger and violence, produce negative and badenergy.Briefly, energy reflects what and who you are at certain point in your life. Itis not permanent, meaning, sometimes, we emanate good energy (Good vibes), andsome other times, we emanate bad energy (Bad vibes).Everything depends on our state of mind, health condition and emotionalsituation. The good news is:1-We can change our negative energy to a positive energy.2-We can see our energy, measure its intensity and use it to ameliorate oursituation. Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ 3-We can sense, and in some cases, see others’ energy and right away determinewhether they are good people or bad people. But first of all, we need to sense our own energy. This will allow us, later on,to see others’ energy, and possibly read them, probe and understand theirintentions, and consequently, protect ourselves against harm and damages causedby the vibrations of their bad energy.On the following pages, I am going to show you step-by-step, how to sense anddirect your energy. *** *** *** Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ III. Materials/tools needed:1. A piece of white paper or a white napkin.2. A candle. Any kind. Color and size are irrelevant.3. A needle or a pin. IV. Preparation:The initial phase is called “Preparation” and includes:Illustration #1, Illustration #2, Illustration #3, Illustration #4, Step One,Step Two and Step Three. Step One:Look now at Illustration #1 , on page 101.Note: When item #10 is done, turn off the light in the room.1. Perform the exercise in the privacy of your room, always after 7.00 PM.2. Perform the exercise on any day of the week, except on Sunday night after10:00 PM or on Monday between 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM.3. Perform the exercise alone.No people or pets should be around, because you must not contaminate your vibes.4. Place the candle on the lower left side of the paper or the napkin.5. Place the paper or the napkin on a solid surface.6. Fold the paper or the napkin as seen on the illustration.7. Draw 2 triangles on the paper or the napkin as seen on the illustration.8. Mark the upper corner of each triangle with a dot as seen on theillustration.9. Light up the candle.10-Stick a needle or a pin in the candle as seen on the illustration.11-Turn off the light in the room or where you are conducting the exercise.Note: The needle should be positioned in a way or at an angle that would reflectits shadow on the paper or the napkin. You can always adjust and re-adjust theposition (Place) of the needle or the pin. Work on this.Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00071.gif]"},{"pageContent":" Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Step Two: Understanding the technique. 1. You must understand what is going on, in order to proceed. So look atIllustration #2. You will see a black line in the middle of the napkin or thepaper. This is a dividing line. It is called Khat.2. The line divides the surface (Paper or napkin) into two areas.3. The top area “A” is a negative spot.4. The lower area “A1” is a positive spot.5. In area “A”, you will find an “Upper Triangle”. This triangle stores thesource of the negative energy.6. In area “A1”, you will find a “Lower Triangle”. This triangle stores thesource of the positive energy.7. The black dot of the upper triangle is the infinitesimally small spot, fromwhich, the negative energy leaks to the outside, and invades area “A”.8. The black dot of the lower triangle is the infinitesimally small spot, fromwhich, the positive energy leaks to the outside and invades area “A1”.9. Illustration #3 will give you additional explanation. So let’s go to page389, and read the explanation of Illustration #3 on page 391. *** *** *** Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00072.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Step Three: Adjusting the shadow of the needle or pin 1. Adjust the position of the needle or the pin, so it would project a shadow ona straight line, as seen in Illustration #3.2. You might also need to adjust the position (Place) of the candle. Try and seewhich one of the two needs alignment.3. Alignment means a straight shadow, right in the middle of “A” and “A1”. Inother words, the shadow of the needle or the pin must almost equally divide thesurface of the napkin or the paper. See Illustration #4.4. This shadow is going to play a major role in your exercise. Additionalinformation on the importance and role of the shadow will be provided in duetime.5. For now, get a straight line (A straight shadow). Do not worry about anythingelse. Everything is going to be just fine. *** *** ***  Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00073.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Illustration #4: 1. Illustration #4 shows you the perfect alignment of the shadow of the needleor the pin.2. This straight line is not going to stay straight.It is going to change either direction or position. You will see this happeningwhen you reach forthcoming steps. *** *** *** Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00074.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ V. The Technique: So far, everything is set for you.You have everything lined up to get ready, and to start a memorable and anextraordinary journey, leading to astonishing discoveries and findings.And now, the exercise/technique begins.But first of all, you have to believe in yourself. You’ve got to believe verystrongly that you are going to succeed.You have to convince yourself that you can do it.You have to believe in the power of your mind.Your mind has tremendous powers. And, I am going to show you step-by-step how todiscover these hidden powers and use them to elevate yourself to a higher levelof awareness. And, to understand how unseen forces, that surround you, produceincomprehensible things your mind could not grasp in the past.It is not an easy enterprise, because it requires:> • Lots of practice, sometimes long hours> • Perseverance> • Determination> • Deep concentration> • Observing a particular diet> • Maintaining an absolute state of tranquility> • Imagination capable of developing and animating visions and mental> projectionDo not get alarmed now by this idea of imagination, mental projection andanimating visions! Part of the technique will give you all the necessaryinstructions on how to use your imagination. So, relax, and get ready. You aregoing to succeed, unquestionably and I am with you all the way.And, if you need additional guidance, you can always write to me atdelafayette6@aol.com [delafayette6@aol.com] . You are most welcome! So, what is the plan now?Well, if you are looking at the candle, the needle or pin, the paper or thenapkin and a shadow on a surface, you will not notice anything extraordinary. Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ But soon, everything is going to change, and something strange might appear onthe napkin or the papers. And, who is going to do this? YOU!Essentially, what we want to accomplish here, is to deviate the shadow we see onthe surface; the shadow of the needle or the pin, that is.In other words, make the shadow move without touching anything. And we are goingto accomplish this, simply by using the power of our mind.You are going to use your mind to order your body to open up the channels ofyour energy that is simultaneously created by your Jabas (Cells in your brains)and the organic substances in your body.Your mind is not creating those vibes, alone. The mental waves, YES! But thevibrations and rays of your body are created by your body. The role of your mindhere is to sense, to guide and to direct all sorts of vibrations, frequencies,waves and rays coming out of your body. By doing so, you will be able to sense,direct and control your energy! And once you achieve that, you will be able to:> • Heal yourself and others> • Remove blocks and obstacles that prevent you from succeeding in many of your> endeavors and causing the effects of bad luck> • Do marvelous things, we are going to talk about in the book.And activate the channels of extraordinary supernatural powers. *** *** *** Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Follow these instructions: 1. The shadow of the needle or the pin will serve as a tool to make your energymaterialize in the form of rays.2. These rays will change into frequencies and the frequencies will change intovibrations.3. In brief, these vibrations reflect the strength or weakness of your energy.4. If your energy is strong, the vibrations are automatically strong andvibrant.5. If your energy is weak, the vibrations are automatically weak and dim.6. But there is a way to strengthen your energy. This technique will show youhow.7. But first of all, you must learn whether your energy is strong or weak. Youcan do that by working with the shadow of the needle or the pin. And this iswhat you have to do.8. For 5 seconds, focus intensely on the shadow.9. For 5 seconds, concentrate on the direction (Position, place) and length ofthe shadow.10. So far, nothing is happening. The shadow did not move. In fact, nothing ismoving.11. The only thing that is going to move now is the “inside” of your mind.Meaning, you are going to tell your mind that your energy, or any form of innerstrength you have inside your body, even some strong ideas or concepts you haveformulated, is getting out of your body, as if you want to get something out ofyour system.12. It does not matter what you are thinking about. The quality and quantity ofyour thoughts are irrelevant. Even anger can produce vibrations, feelings, innersensations and that’s enough to project your energy on the outside.13. Get busy with your ideas, wishes, dreams, anything you could think of.14. In a few seconds, you will start to feel something. And we are not going totalk about these feelings for the time being. It is normal and expected that youwill feel something. Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ If not, start again, but this time, think about something you dislike; a badexperience, a failure, regret, a physical pain, etc.15. This should trigger some sensations, and soon after, these sensations willproduce vibrations.And these vibrations will usher in your energy.16. Now, tell your mind that the shadow on the napkin or piece of paper isgetting a little bit fuzzy. Keep thinking about this, for 5 seconds.17. Place both hands on the solid surface where you have placed the napkin orthe piece of papers. This will anchor part of your energy into the napkin or thepiece of paper.18. Stay like this for 5 seconds or so, and now hold firm on the solid surface.19. After 7 or 8 seconds, sometimes a little bit longer, you will start to feelsome sort of resonance or small vibes getting to your fingers.20. This is going to happen. No question about it.21. Now, mentally, order the shadow to move, in any direction.22. Use your concentration to make this happen. For instance, concentrate on thevery end of the shadow, using your right eye, and simultaneously, focus on theneedle using your left eye. You can do it, it is not very difficult.Keep repeating this double concentration, until you get it right.23. Once, the end of the shadow and the needle are within your concentrationperimeter, look right away at the shadow.24. The shadow is moving now. Absolutely! I guarantee it. And if not, stop theexercise and check “information on diet”. Repeat the exercise the very next day.25. If the shadow begins to move, follow it with both eyes. Stay like this, for5 seconds or so and close your eyes.26. Keep both eyes closed for 10 seconds or so and keep on concentrating on theshadow inside your mind.27. While concentrating on the shadow inside your mind, remove your hands fromthe solid surface, place your left hand against your forehead, and your righthand against your solar plexus. See illustration A and illustration B on thenext pages. Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00075.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00076.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ 28. Maintain this position for 20 seconds or so.29. After 20 seconds or so, drop down both hands and look at the shadow on thesolid surface.30. And voila! The shadow has shifted!!31. Now pay attention to the new alignment of the shadow, meaning the newposition or direction of the shadow.32. If the shadow has moved to the left (Area marked A), as shown inIllustration #5, on page 402, this is an indication that your energy is introuble, meaning one or all of the following:> • Bad energy> • Negative energy> • Weak vibrations> • Poor mental resonance (Temporary) caused and/or originated by a perturbed> physical or emotional state> • Weak aura> • Lack of mental clarity These etheric symptoms indicate that:> • Your Double is unbalanced> • Your Khateyn Tarika lines are blurry, meaning that your “Mental and Physical> Zones” are not protected> • You have lost your protection shieldConsequently, your energy is not effective; and therefore, you need right awayto strengthen your energy. There is a technique in this book that shows you howto do it.33. If you got results indicating that you have bad energy, close the exerciseright away, and refer to “Instructions about Diet and Hygiene”, on pages407-408.34- Bad or negative energy could be disastrous. Its consequences include (Toname a few):> • a-Failure in your relationships with others> • b-Health deterioration> • c-Alienating people> • d-Bad judgment> • e-Misunderstanding others> • f-IndecisivenessDiscovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________> > > • g-Fatigue> • h-Laziness> • i-Fear> • j-Anxiety> • k-Bad luck 35. If the shadow has moved to the right (Area marked A1), as shown inIllustration #6, on page 403, this is an indication that you have a healthy,strong and a good energy36. Go now to page 404 and check other resultsThey are revealed in Illustration # 7. Read the pertinent explanations on page 404. *** *** *** Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00077.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00078.gif]Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Explanation for Illustration #7 1. Illustration #7, on page 405, refers to the “State of No Variation.” Meaning,your energy is stagnant.In other words, your energy is neither bad nor good. Simply put, it is dormant,and useless.2. This happens, when the shadow does not move. It stayed still. It’s immobile.Your energy needs energy.3. Well, this situation is not so terrible, because it does not indicate thatyou have bad vibes. And, when you don’t have bad vibes, you don’t disturbothers, you don’t alienate others, but by the same token, you don’t attractothers and you don’t succeed in your relationships with others. And, that couldbe unpleasant, especially if your energy remains inactive.4. But we have good news; you can activate your energy, make it vibrant, healthyand extremely positive, by practicing techniques described in Illustrations 8 to15, on the next pages. *** *** ***  Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00079.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Instructions about Diet and Hygiene: The Masters told that:1. Consuming alcohol in moderation is accepted. Wine is good. Drinking beer inmoderation is good, but consuming a large quantity of hard liquor deterioratesthe vibrations of your energy. And when the vibrations and frequencies of yourbody and Fikr (Mind) are damaged or threatened, this becomes an indication of aweak energy, and a perturbed inner vitality.2. Animal fat must be avoided3. Maintaining a good hygiene is a must4. Teeth cavities produce bad vibrations5. Bad breath produces bad vibrations6. Chemically treated and manufactured tobacco produce blurry vibrations7. The use of medicinal drugs (Pills, liquids, others) produces temporary blurryvibrations8. The use of narcotics of any kind is awful. It produces bad energy, emanatesbad vibrations, and blocks your Jabas9. Very long nails produce bad vibrations10.

Slightly, very slightly and very slowly, push the copy-paper forward21. Do not open your eyes22. Move your finger one centimeter to the left23. Keep your finger there24. Bring your left hand closer to your solar plexus, and press your handagainst your solar plexus25. Keep your left hand there for 5 seconds or so26. Inside your mind, visualize a gray square moving toward the letter A27. Press a little bit harder against your solar plexus28. Take a deep breath for 4 seconds or so29. Open your eyes half-way. And stay like this for 3 seconds or so30. Close your eyes31. Inside your mind, tell yourself that the gray square has already moved tothe left side, but it needs adjustment32. Inside your mind, tell yourself that you are going to anchor the gray squarein the “A” areaDiscovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ 33. For 10 seconds or so, keep telling yourself that you are doing it34. Remove your left hand from your solar plexus and place it right away on theleft side of the solid surface35. Open your eyes. The gray square is in the “A” area. You can do it! Many did!If you get this result, this is an indication that either you have activatedyour energy and/or your energy was already activated, but needs direction. Ifyou manage to transport/teleport the gray square to the “A” area, this meansthat you will be able to direct your energy toward any person, any object andany target you wish. And the results could be spectacular36. Keep practicing and practicing at least twice a day for a period of 5 days37. On the 6 th day, engage yourself in a dialogue with a friend,preferably a stubborn oneWithout ill-purpose or vicious intentions, and gently, disagree with your friendon any subject he/she is talking about. As expected, your friend will keep onarguing because he/she is stubborn. That’s fine. Now, in a discreet manner,place your left hand against your solar plexus for a few seconds, and mentallysend a message to your friend, telling him/her that she is wrong. While you aredoing this, focus on his/her forehead for 2 seconds. And right away look him/herin the eyes for 2 seconds. Your friend has already changed his/her mind withoutknowing!38. There is no doubt that you will succeed. But if you are skeptic, extremelymaterialistic and lazy, you will fail!

Meaning, transposing/teleporting two grey rectangles to “A”, and to“B”.Go to page 420, to get the instructions. And look at Illustration #11 A on page421. *** *** ***  Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________[Image00090.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Note: Look at Illustration 11 on page 419; this is the result you should get: 2grey rectangles, just by using your own energy diffused by three fingers, asshown in Illustration #11 A, on page 421. The final result is shown inIllustration #11 B, on page 423. Follow these instructions: 1. Copy the page of Illustration #8, and place it on a solid surface. Your deskis fine.2. You are going now to use three fingers to generate energy. This energy hasgood vibrations you could use for self-healing, as well as for healing others.You will find plenty of information and instruction on the “Healing Touch”, involumes 1 and 23. The energy you are going to witness is produced by your mind, not by yourbody.The mental energy is stronger and far more superior to the body’s energy; thebody’s energy powers are limited by distances.The mental energy transcends space and distances, meaning you can send yourmental energy to remote areas, to people living far away, so on.Authentic healers and Rouhaniyiin can heal people at distance. The less-awakenedmasters use the healing touch.In some instances and situations, you can use others’ energy, and/or incorporatetheir good vibrations in the healing process. You are not the only one who hasenergy.Remember, energy comes from everywhere:> • a-Nature, in general> • b-The cosmos (Universe)> • c-People> • d-Plants,> • e-Solid objects like stones, diamonds, crystals> • f-Animals, pets4.No matter how weak you are, no matter how skeptic you are, no matter howuntrained and unfamiliar with these sorts of things you are, you still haveenergy somewhere inside your body, outside your body, inside your brain, andoutside your brain.Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00091.gif]   Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ On the following pages, you will find how and where different levels of energyare stored.In other parts of the book you will find several grids you can use tocentralize, exteriorize and direct your energy at yourself, at others, atobjects, and situations/circumstances that are blocking your success.Be patient, and everything will shine on the road of your life.5.Place your three fingers at the bottom of the bottom of the candle as shown inillustration #11A, on page 421.Keep your fingers there for 3 seconds and remove your fingers.6.Now, look at the bottom of the candle for 2 seconds, and bring your 3 fingersvery close to the bottom of the candle, and place your fingers at 0.5 centimeterdistance from the bottom of the candle. Do not touch the candle. Keep yourfingers there for 5 seconds or so.7.After 5 seconds, take a deep breath.8.Close your eyes now, and take another deep breath.9.Very gently and meticulously touch the end of the bottom of the candle, withyour 3 fingers.

And when you notice that thecandle is right under the Square containing the letters “A” and “B”, as shown inIllustration #11F, on page 429, vibrate your fingers for 5 seconds.19.Look one more time at Illustration #11 F, on page 429.20.Look now at Illustration #11 G, on page 432.21.Now read the final instruction on page 430. *** *** ***  Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00097.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ Final Instruction: 22.With your fingers push the candle inside the Square. containing “A”, and “B”,as shown in Illustration #11G, on page 432.23.By now, and if you have successfully reached this step, your regular mind,the one you are familiar with, will come to state of trance, mentally, notpsychedelically or spiritually. There is nothing spiritual in this exercise.Only MENTAL!24.There is a part of your Supersymetric Mind that will take over, meaning apart of your duplicate mind will exteriorize and guide your physical senses (Inthis case, your fingers).25.The candle is no longer exclusively controlled by the physical vibrations ofyour body (In this case, your fingers), but also by the mental energy of yourmind. The candle will enter the Square without any problem. Please keepbelieving in yourself. You have nothing to loose, except a few moments from yourfree time.26.Once the candle is inside the Square, tell the candle to spread a gray lightover the letter “A”, and the letter “B”.27.Tell the candle to fill up area “A”, and area “B” with a gray shade, as seenin Illustration #11B, on page 423.28.Concentrate on the candle inside the Square, and keep telling the candle tofill up the square with the gray shade for at least 5 seconds.29.Close your eyes now for 10 seconds, and repeat step 28.30.As soon as you start to feel some sort of numbness in your right hand, openimmediately your eyes…you will see area “A”, and area “B” covered with a grayshade, as seen in Illustration #11H, on page 433.31.You are almost at the very end of the exercise. Now, look at gray areas of“A” and “B”, breath deeply, breath one more time, and tell yourself that You,the Square, and the Candle are ONE.32. Repeat 5 times, what you have just said “Me, the Square and the Candle areone”. Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ 33.Breath deeply and slowly.34.Close your eyes for 10 seconds, and rapidly think about what you haveaccomplished.35.Open your eyes now…they are no longer the same eyes you had before, becausethey have entered another dimension and saw a sphere few in our modern worldhave seen.But the most important thing in all this, IS:> • The learning you have acquired> • The learning of discovering your energy> • The learning of sensing your energy> • The learning and technique for animating and directing the vibrations of> your energy. Now, what can you do with your energy? The sky is the limit. *** *** ***  Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00098.gif] Discovering your mind and body energy____________________________________________ [Image00099.gif] Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ Sources and Levels of Energy and Vibrations____________________ I. We are surrounded by energy and vibes: We are surrounded by energy; all sorts and types of energies;> • a-Nature’s energy> • b-Animals’ energy> • c-Objects’ energy> • d-People’s energy> • e-Our own energyAnd we can’t escape it, like Earth’s gravity.In essence, energy by itself is not the main and principle danger we are facing.It is rather the:> • a-Vibrations> • b-Frequencies> • c-Rays> • d-Radiationsof the energy, which are damaging and in some cases lethal. The hideous part of all this, is the fact that:> • We can’t see the vibrations of the energy> • We don’t know for sure the origin of its vibrations> • We have no clues, where they are going to hit us?> • We can’t guess, when are they are going to hit us?> • We can’t predict and measure the vibrations’ immediate, short term and long> term effects on us, our health, business, progress and environment in general. I knew several people in the Eastern and Western hemispheres, who died frombeing exposed to Al-Atila (Awfully bad) or Al-Fasida (Rotten) vibrations; otherpeople became insane, and a great number of them went out of business,virtually, they became flat broke, penniless, and homeless. Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ Around the 1998, I learned about an old friend of mine who was stricken by aseries of mishaps, several financial calamities and terrifying flux of bad luck.Just a few years, prior to what has happened to him, he was on the top of theworld; fabulously rich, enormously successful and popular beyond belief.But he had two major problems (According to some):a-His generosity; he treated his successful business as charity, meaning, givingaway so much, to so many people, and never could imagine that one day, he willrun out of money.b-Bad company; he never suspected that many of those who surrounded him were thescum of the Earth. He was a giver, they were takers, he was forgiving, they werevindictive and vengeful.And, they were street-smart!They could camouflage pretty good their intentions, viciousness, and hypocrisy.Unfortunately, he could not sense and read their vibrations.Bottom line, he lost his business, his mansion, everything he had. In fact, hebecame jobless and homeless for a very long time.In July of 1998, one of my associates told me about what has happened to him,and asked me if I could help.“Of course I will,” I said, “no question about it.”I start looking for him everywhere, absolutely everywhere. I called almosteverybody, asking them if they knew where I could find him. But nobody could.Finally, in September, 1998, and while visiting New York City, I bumped intoPhilippe Z., who previously worked for me in Rome. After warm greetings, a fewlaughs and stuff like that, Philippe said, “Hey boss, do you know what happenedto Mr. B? (Call him B for now) You are not going to believe it…I saw him a fewdays ago, and he looked like s..t!”I asked Philippe if he knew where he lives and he said, “I will take you there.”“Perfect, let’s go right now”, I replied. Philippe took me to a neighborhood inBrooklyn, New York.To make the long story short, I met my old friend in his empty apartment; empty,because he had no furniture and he was sleeping on the floor. Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ I sensed his room and on the spot, I told him to get out of this neighborhood,because it sits right above an underground current infested with bad energy.I sensed it right away, the moment I entered the building.What happened next, I will keep it confidential. As soon as my friend moved outof that Brooklyn negative neighborhood, he began to regain his senses and two orthree weeks later, he got a solid job offer from one of the most prestigiouscorporations in Burbank, California.Apparently, the CEO/VP of the corporation, found my friend’s CV (Resume) in atrash basket in one of the offices of the human resources department of thecompany. It is like a fairy tale. But, it did happen and I was there to see it.I remember telling my friend that as long as he stays where he is (thatmiserable neighborhood), he will either go insane or kill himself from despair.But, if he leaves that area, in less than a month, he will be back again on hisfeet, because that underground negative energy will no longer have any affect onhim, on his body, on his psyche and his bad luck will be removed right away.I was so happy he listened to me! An acquaintance of mine, Mr. Kumar, a fine gentleman from Benares, India, toldme about a friend of his parents who owned a 7-11 store in Brooklyn. At thebeginning, he was doing great; the store brought lots of money, and everythingseems to be fine, business-wise, family-wise, and so on, until he moved with hisfamily to a new building in Park Slope, Brooklyn.One month later, his wife fell in the kitchen and broke her hip. His youngestson got severe skin irritations and he himself began to lose his memory. Inthree months, he lost his store and his wife became half-paralyzed.Kumar solicited the help of a Swami, who rushed to the house of the unfortunatefamily. As soon as the Swami entered the house, he felt a very strong Atilacurrent, and did not waste a moment to tell the family to get out of theapartment as soon as possible.One year later, the family learned that the previous tenants met almostidentical fate.Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ The Swami said, the building and two adjacent stores (One was a 99 cents storeand the other a Middle Eastern deli) were “breathing” negative vibes, left byprevious occupants.Their vibes were trapped inside the metal and wood frames of the externalstructure of the building and the stores.The Swami saved their lives.So, as you see, some areas, zones, neighborhoods, streets and buildings cancripple us, because they sit above underground current (s), charged withnegative energy.The same catastrophic results could happen to all of you, if you are surroundedby negative people, or if you conduct your business around people who emitnegative energy vibrations.In some cases, one single apartment, one particular apartment, on one singlefloor, on one particular floor of a building, (fancy or modest, in the city orthe suburb) can cause us so many damages, financially, emotionally, mentally,and physically), simply because the previous tenant was charged with intenselystrong negative energy.Even though, he or she has vacated the premises, the residues and “Imprints” ofhis or her negative vibrations/rays are still in the apartment; sometimes wefind these killing vibes inside the walls, inside the closets and it is going totake some time to clear the air. Bad vibrations can originate from all sorts of sources- not only from people andareas. Animals have their own energy. A pet who loves you will emit good energy,even therapeutic vibes. A pet that dislikes you will do just the opposite.Solid objects, tools, hard surfaces, gadgets and similar materials also diffusestrong vibes.Unfortunately, many of us are not aware that some of the stuff we keep at homeare very damaging to our health and mental state. We are going to talk aboutthis in depth, in the forthcoming chapters.In addition to people, animals and solid objects, the Cosmos also has strongvibrations and biological-etheric radiations. All these vibes are found at Level1. See Illustration #12 A, on page 443. Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ II. Chart of the 3 basic levels/sources of energy around you.See Illustration #12 [Image00100.gif] Summary:There are 3 basic, original and primordial sources of energy that surround youin this physical dimension (Earth).

The 3 sources of energy at Level 1:At Level 1, we have 3 sources/origins of energy> • Source 1: Cosmos: Nature/Universe> • Source 2: Living Organisms> • Source 3: You. Your mind. Your body b. Brief explanation of each source of energy:Note: See Illustration #12 A, on page 443. Source 1 at Level 1:Source 1 represents Mother Nature which accumulates the atmosphere, the skies,the stars, the planets, our solar system, the oceans, the thunders, the light,the shadow; everything that constitutes our world.In brief, the Universe.And there is nothing you can do about it. Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ You can avoid the ray and the heat of the sun, but you can’t escape the effects,the solar rays, radiations, energy and vibrations, have on humanity, you, me,them, on our planet, our houses, and our way of life.You can take some measures of precaution, but the energy and vibrations ofMother Nature and their effects on us are more stronger than any protectionshield, tool or apparatus (Physical, spiritual, mental) at our disposal, thus,we will pass on. Source 2 at Level 1:Source 2 belongs to all living organisms, including all sorts of:> • a-Life-forms> • b-Animals> • c-Human beings> • d-Bacteria> • e-Viruses, and> • f-Strange creaturesIn the present work, we will focus on human beings, because this is one of ourmajor concerns. Asking Jean-Paul Sartre to define hell, he replied, “L’enferc’est les autres!” (Hell is the others!)99% of all our problems are caused by humans and remember what the AnunnakiUlema have said, “Earth, is the dumpster of the universe and the human beingsare the lowest life-forms on the cosmic, spiritual, physical, metaphysical andmental Araya (Net) of the universe.” Source 3 at level 1:Source 3 belongs to you, to your body and to your mind. In the present work, wewill focus on YOU, because this is one of our major concerns. Let’s go now to Level 2, on page 444. *** *** *** Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ [Image00101.gif] Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ Level 2 [Image00102.gif] __________________ The two sources of energy and vibrations at Level 2:Note: See Illustration #12 B, on page 445.At Level 2, we find 2 sources of energy and vibrations.Source 1 is You. And Source 2 represents the others, all kinds of people. a. Brief explanation of each source of energy:Source 1 at Level 2:Source 1 at Level 2, represents everything about you; your thoughts, intentions,visions, dreams, aspirations, creativity, plans, business, purposes andobjectives, your deeds and acts, your body, your hygiene, your habits, youraddictions, your character and temper, your personality, the kind of food youeat, liquids you drink, your intelligence, emotions and even feelings.In brief, your body and its substances and your mind with its substances.So, every time you absorb something, eat something, think about something, dosomething, your energy level changes; and as a result, the vibrations of yourenergy change.Even when you talk, trained ones will guess, whether you are telling the truthor lying.Why and how?Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ [Image00103.jpg] [Image00104.jpg] [Image00104.jpg] Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ Because, your words, your sentences, your intentions behind the words andsentences, and what you were thinking about when you opened your mouth you sendvibrations that can be detected, read, and deciphered by the trained ones(Teachers, masters, adepts, etc.)The same thing applies to others. So, once you have finished your training, youwill be able to find out who is telling you the truth and who is lying to you.This is one of the major benefits you get from learning about the functioning ofthe energy and the meaning of its vibrations. Source 2 at Level 2:Source 2 represents the others, all kinds of people; good and bad, intelligentand idiots. And each one of them registers different kinds, levels and colors ofvibrations.Their energy, emanated from their bodies and brains, change from time to time.And the vibrations of their energy also change from time to time.For example, if they are telling you the truth, the color of their vibrationturn gold or bright orange. If they are lying to you, the color of theirvibrations turns grey or black.So the vibrations change constantly. By the same token, different parts of theirbodies could also emanate different kinds of energy and vibrations,simultaneously.For example, if they have malicious intentions, their body will emit deep greyor black vibrations from and around their head, neck, and shoulders, and ifduring that time, their health condition is in a perfect shape, their bodieswill emit strong blue vibrations, coming from and around their solar plexus,reflecting their good health.So, here we have two different kinds of vibrations coming from the same personand at the same time:a-Bad vibes coming from and around the head/neck/shouldersb-Good vibes coming from and around the solar plexus In this situation, the Khateyn Tarika and/or their electro-magnetic zone, aura,etc, sent two messages, different vibes, different colors and so on.Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ Additional vibes (Third ones) will come out of their bodies –at the same time–if they are hiding narcotics or a lethal hardware in their pocket(s), such as arevolver. Our electro-magnetic field can emit dozens of different vibes,simultaneously and each one corresponds to a particular reason, a specific partof our body or brain, and other thoughts/activities we are part of.The trained ones can see all these vibrations at the same time. They are thereto see in the electro-magnetic zone surrounding their bodies. With some goodtraining, you too will be able to see people’s vibrations. b. Who emits bad vibes that could disrupt the normal rhythm of our life, causelots of damages and bring bad luck?The list is endless.But generally speaking, people who have negative energy and bad vibes are thosewho have committed crimes (Any kind), who are severely mentally disturbed andothers who belong to similar categories. This is obvious, as you already know.Therefore, rather than talking about what you already know about, people who apriori are known to produce negative vibes, and who are not part of your normaldaily life, I rather bring your attention to people who are most likely to knowor to meet in normal situations, more or less regularly, and in some instances,on a regular basis.Regular basis means individuals to be found around you and/or likely to meet invarious common or public places, intentionally or unintentionally; these personsblend regularly in our society, workplace and other normal situations.Here is a brief synopsis:a. Category 1:Prostitutes, call-girls, escorts, dominatrix-ladies, strippers and anygirl/woman who belongs to this racket (Professionally and/or occasionally): Theyare among the worst kind. Don’t ever believe the myth of the prostitute with agolden heart! Nowadays, in our ever growing complex modern societies, it hasbecome difficult to recognize and/or identify –right away– a woman who belongsto that category.Sources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ In the past, it was quite easy to recognize one, from her clothes, make-up,outfit, location and behavior. No more! Some of these “social prostitutes” andcourtesans could be on the outside a respectable married men/women, and/or oneof your colleagues at work, but you never knew that on the side, andoccasionally, she is in the prostitution business. So it is hard to tell, untilyou meet one of them intimately, or through shady connections.And voila! Quelle Surprise! What a nasty or a shocking surprise.In Manhattan, New York alone, 9 out of 10 girls and women between the age of 18and 26 who do not have a regular job, an honest pay-check, who get paid cash,and who pays a high monthly rent ($2,500 and plus) are in this racket.

It is in their nature to cause damages to others.They are the lowest of the lowest in our world.And, they do it through character assassination, vicious gossip, and badmouthingyou. You will find them almost everywhere; where you work, in supermarkets, inthe competitive commercial market, schools, organizations, Wall Street, media,Internet, their own websites and blogs, on the streets, in showbiz, atreceptions, parties and even in creative fields, including science, arts and thehumanities.Some, you could meet, others, probably never. Quite often, they are people who have never met you and most probably you haveno interest in knowing them. They envy your success, your wealth, your fame,your popularity and even your beautiful children.They don’t know you, the real YOU! Yet, they use anything they have at theirdisposal to hurt you. This category is the worst of the worst. And their badvibes could cause you serious damages, if you do not protect your “Zone”, andKhateyn Tarika. They are there to get you.So strengthen your “Ehetric-Physical Zone”.In this book, I have provided you with a few techniques to create an ethericprotection shield. This shield will repel their bad vibes. So, you better startworking on these techniques. You should never deal with any person who badmouthsothers. They are up to no good. Avoid them, don’t pay attention to theirtactics, but protect yourself, your interests, investment and success.One of the techniques previously mentioned will show you how to do it. As theold French proverb says: “ Les chiens aboient , la caravane passe.” Meaning: “The dogs bark, but the caravan goes by.” This is true, but protecting yourselfagainst vicious vibes will make the dogs run away, and the caravan pass faster!

Those people have very distinctivevibes, because they emit rays and vibrations of silverish-gray to metallicgray-pale beige colors.They are sharp and piercing.They can cut holes “Pockets” in your “Zone”.Unfortunately, you can’t reverse their vibes.

Are there specific places and areas that emit and or contain/store bad vibesthat could negatively affect our life, business, health, and luck?Oh yes! I have already answered this question in volume 1. But, I will give youfurther information on the subject.Note: The fact that those places retain, store or produce bad vibes, you shouldnot consider the people who live and/or work at these places, as responsible fortheir bad vibes.The very nature of these places and areas, their mode and type of theiroperations/business, the reasons why people (Employees, operators or visitors)are found there, or go there, the spatial and etheric memories which are trappedin these places/spots, and other incomprehensible factors, create a negativeenvironment and produce bad vibes.So, people who are operating those premises are not categorically and entirelyresponsible for the bad vibes you will find in those premises. Are therespecific places and areas that emit and or contain/store bad vibes? Yes, yes!Almost everywhere. The list is endless. But the most recognizable ones are(In no particular order): > • Abortion clinics> • Ammunitions’ warehouses/storage areas> • Amputations’ areas> • Animal fat and synthetic products areas> • Arenas and stadiums> • Arsenal depots> • Athletes lockers rooms> • Bars> • Cemeteries> • Chemical waste areas> • Collection agencies> • Concentration camps> • Convention halls and areas (Particularly political)> • Correction centersSources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ > • Courthouses> • Dentists’ offices> • Detention centers> • Entities trapped areas> • Funeral parlors> • Garbage areas and dumpsters> • Governments’ offices> • Graveyards> • Hospitals> • Hunting areas> • Jails> • Law offices> • Make-up counters> • Mental health institutions> • Models’ runway/areas/dressing rooms> • Morgues> • Narcotics, drugs and addictive substances’ warehouses, distribution centers> and joints for customers> • Orgies gatherings> • Nuclear testing areas> • Police stations> • Prostitution houses> • Rehab centers> • Rest rooms> • Sewers> • Slaughter houses> • Slave trade operations> • Stock markets floor(s)> • Strip joints> • Sweat shops> • Underground military bases> • Violent sports areas> • Wall Street> • Wars’ zones> • Weapons’ factoriesSources and levels of energy and vibrations____________________________________________ At level 3 [Image00112.gif] At this level, you elevate your vibes to the highest degree. There are severaltechniques to do and learn from; however, they are highly advanced and complex.It is quite impossible to learn these techniques on your own without a personalguidance from a spiritual teacher. *** *** ***Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Energy’s good days and bad days.Energy’s good hours and the bad hours ___________________ I. Introduction:Your energy does not stay the same all the time. For example, on Monday, yourenergy could be very healthy and strong, while on Tuesday, it gets weak, andyour vibes begin to dim.Then on Thursday, you hear some good news, and your energy becomes wealthier andstronger, and so on.Everything depends on your state of mind, and the situations you go through oryou face. Of course, others’ interaction with you and your immediate environmentwill affect your energy and vibes. To keep your energy in good shape (Balance and equilibrium), you could practiceon the Mouraba technique (Squares of the week), which I have explained on thefollowing pages. As long as your energy (Mental from your brain, and physicalfrom your body) is strong, your “Etheric-physical Zone” will remain strong;meaning your etheric protection shield will protect you against others’ badvibes and malicious intentions. Like everything in the world, maintaining equilibrium, strength and health,require:a-Training or development (Growth)b-Nutritionc-Stability Cars and airplanes need maintenance and repair, plants and tree needs water togrow, to keep a candle burning, we need oxygen, and to stay alive our body needsfood, water, and oxygen. The same thing applies to our energy.Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ So the 46 million Dollar question is:How to keep our energy strong and healthy?There are several techniques proposed by a multitude of healers and spiritualmasters around the globe.But, the Anunnaki Ulema techniques are the easiest and most effective; theyprovide us with answers related to: a-Training or development (Growth):Techniques, exercises and practices are given and explained to you. Thus, youwill train yourself, your mind and your body, and by doing so, you will developa strong energy, and healthy vibes. b-Nutrition:You have to feed your energy. It needs nutrition; mental, etheric and physicalfood. The Mouraba technique explains to you what kind of nutrition, your energyneeds. c-Stability:You have to maintain your energy in good shape, otherwise, others will invadeyour Khateyn Tarika, your “Zone” and cause lots of damages. Thus, stability of ahealthy and strong energy is a must, if you want to protect yourself againstothers.The Mouraba will show you how.The second 46 million Dollar question is:How to protect ourselves against others’ negative energy, bad vibes andmalicious thoughts/intentions?Some of the techniques to protect ourselves were explained in volume 1, but inthis volume, there are few ones that would add an extra thick layer ofprotection. II. The Technique:Look at the Energy Equilibrium/Strength Illustration #1, on page 469. Theillustration is also referred to as MOURABA Illustration #1. The technique iscalled Mouraba.Mouraba is an Ana’kh word meaning a square. In our technique, each day of theweek is represented by a square. I am going to explain to you the meaning of allthis. Go now to page 470 to get the information and pertinent instructions.Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ [Image00113.jpg] Energy Equilibrium/Strength Illustration #1MOURABA Illustration #1 Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Information and pertinent instructions.Bad days and bad hours of the week: Note: Look at MOURABA Illustration #2, on page 472. 1. The big square is called Mouraba. It represents a whole week.2. On your left, you will see a series of small squares, starting with theMonday square, and ending in the middle of the illustration with the Saturdaysquare. Friday square is black. I will explain the black color, when we get to“Friday”.3. Each day of the week has lucky hours and unlucky hours.4. Each hour of the day corresponds to a particular or a specific activity ofyours.5. If you start and/or complete any project or a business plan during the luckyhour, you will succeed at ease.6. If you do it during the opening of the unlucky hour, you will fail.7. If you are exposed to others’ bad vibes during an unlucky hour, yourunprotected “Zone” would be invaded, and the bad vibes would invade your zone,and hurt you. The bad vibes will bring you back luck, in the form of a failurein what you are working on.8. You have to protect your zone, feel your surrounding (Environment), andestablish a barrier against others’ bad vibes.9. There are general rules to establish those barriers against others’ badvibes. However, each day of the week has its own rhythm and vulnerability hours.For these reasons, we will start with Monday. Monday:See Illustration CE #1, on page 472.The Sahiriin, Rouhaniyiin and Anunnaki Ulema, all agree that Monday is chargedwith an intense cosmic energy, created by Mother Nature and people. This cosmicenergy reaches its peak between 10 AM and 4 PM.Unfortunately, it is not a positive energy; it could be either neutral ornegative. The variation of its nature, quite often, negatively or at leastunpleasantly affects the 9 to 5 employees.Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Thus, creating barriers against this energy on Sunday, between 7 PM and 8 PM isa must. The forthcoming chapters will show you how. For the time being, let’sconcentrate on the bad days and bad hours of the week. Let’s keep focusing onMonday. In addition to creating barriers to stop the negative vibes, you should alsocomply with the following rules: > • a-Do not leave dirty dishes and utensils in your sink> • b-Clean all ashtrays> • c-Make you bed> • d-Do not leave dirty laundry inside the home> • e-Open the window (s) if you can> • f-Open one or two faucets, and let water drip for 10 seconds> • g-Do not drink alcohol between 6 PM and 8 PM Look now at Illustration CE #1, on page 473, Illustration CE#2, on page 474. *** *** *** Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________[Image00114.gif] [Image00115.gif] [Image00116.gif]  [Image00115.gif] [Image00117.gif] Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Tuesday:See Illustration CE #3, on page 476. Tuesday is an excellent day for writing proposals and grants. The most favorablehours are between 11 AM and 1 PM. According to the Rouhaniyiin, the cosmicnegative energy is weak on Tuesday.This, does not mean that people would not emit bad vibes.People do all the time, regardless of the effects of Mother Nature on us, andour lucky days and lucky hours.This is why, we should keep our Khateyn Tarika fortified, healthy and inequilibrium. Between 8 PM and 10 PM, we have neutral time, meaning a few hoursto hang around, do ordinary things, as usual, but not to start a major project.A few moments after 10 PM, the good energy of Mother Nature will start toweaken. Consequently, we should not undertake major projects, and make finaldecisions on important matters.Others’ negative vibes get intensified between 11 PM and 6 AM. *** *** *** [Image00115.gif] [Image00118.gif] Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Wednesday:Look at Illustration CE #4, on page 478.It is self-explanatory.The hours between 10 AM and 3 PM are positive hours. There is a strong positivecurrent, and the abundance of good vibes make these hours very productive.It is the perfect timing to conclude deals, give conferences, meet new people,make important decision, get busy in your yard, do shopping, even, to flirt.However, between 11 PM and 3 AM, negative energy will resurface. Consult theMaps of states and areas charged with underground negative current. *** *** ***  [Image00115.gif] [Image00119.gif] Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Thursday:Look at Illustration CE #5, on page 480.The hours between 8 AM and 11 AM are good hours.They are open to any of your projects and endeavors, particularly to finances,investment, starting a new enterprise, a new business, remodeling, selling, realestate, visits, and so on.The hours between 3 PM and 2 PM are perfect for evaluating the results of yourprojects and decisions, to make new decisions, to explore other possibilities,to renegotiate deals, to submit offers, to write new proposals, and forplanning.The hours between 8 PM and 10 PM are excellent for selling and/or displayingyour art, paintings, books. Galleries displaying artwork will do great businessbetween these hours. Receptions will get good results.These hours are highly recommended for spiritual work, esoteric exercises, andexploring the world of the occult.However, between 2 AM and 5 AM, the negative energy will resurface again. Becareful. Be alert. By now, you know what you should no do during the negativehours. *** *** *** [Image00120.gif] [Image00115.gif] Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Friday:Look at Illustration CE #6, on page 482.Friday is a very important day in the calendar of the Rouhaniyiin. I am notreferring to their esoteric and supernatural work, and communications withentities and spirits. Friday is important because it is a bridge between strongphysical-cosmic energies and others’ energies.On Friday, mixed currents underground merge, and create unpredictablevibrations. If you have started a discussion, and/or submitted areport/proposal/ plan of action to your boss, associates and potentialinvestors, you must do it between 8 AM and 11 AM, because these three hours willbe automatically followed by 2 intense hours; meaning that heated debates,unpleasant arguments, and the emergence of mild negative vibes will developbetween 1 PM and 3 PM.Avoid criticism and arguments between 3 PM and 4 PM.The hours between 8 PM and 10 PM are excellent for socializing, meeting newpeople, making contacts, going out, and so on.However, you must re-energize your Khateyn Tarika before you go out.Negative energy will re-emerge between 1 AM and 5 AM. Note: The Friday’s square is black, because it represents the emergence of avery strong negative current that could last until the end of the week. *** *** *** [Image00121.gif][Image00115.gif] "},{"pageContent":" Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Saturday:Look at Illustration CE #7, on page 484.Cosmic energy circulates very strongly on Saturday between 8 AM and 11 AM,therefore, your home must be absolutely clean. No mess anywhere.Messy stuff and dirty things inside your home will disrupt the positive flow ofenergy. Open a window or two, turn on a kitchen faucet for 10 seconds or so.Saturday is a good day to spend with your loved ones. From 2 PM to 4 PM, goodenergy rides with you. Read Friday’s chart, for the following hours. *** *** *** [Image00122.gif] [Image00115.gif]Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Sunday:Look at Illustration CE #8, on page 486.Self-explanatory. However, pay attention to the hours between 1 AM and 5 AM!Those are bad hours for almost everything, except, perhaps, for casinos’business, and some shady activities.Whether you are a small or big-time entrepreneur, do not make final decision (s)during these hours.A very strong cosmic negative energy circulates during these treacherous hours.Avoid travel (Long distances).Do not argue with people in a position of power. Go to sleep. *** *** *** [Image00123.gif] [Image00115.gif]Good days, bad days, good hours, bad hours____________________________________________ Reversing the flux of bad energy, bad days, and bad hours______________________ Reversing the current of bad cosmic energy is a complicated process but notimpossible. It is closely related to the negative hours of the week, and howthese hours are governed by negative cosmic vibrations; it has nothing to dowith your Rizmanah, and your lucky and unlucky hours and days.The flux of energy is conditioned by cosmic currents, some circulate in the air,and others underground. And unfortunately you are caught between.I will not be able to explain to you how to reverse a cosmic flux in this book,because you need a personal guidance.Mouraba Illustration #3 refers to the “Reversing Process”.Basically, it is reconstructing time continuum of cosmic energy backward. Iknow, it is complicated. Nevertheless, you can write to me for additionalinformation and partial guidance.

Noun. termThe technique of using the Hamnika-mekhakeh. I. Synopsis of the conceptII. The Ulema-Anunnaki days areIII. The calendars’ gridsIV. The use of a languageV. The preparation and use of the grids _________________ I. Synopsis of the concept:Humans follow certain calendars. The most common one is the Gregorian Calendar,which is a reflection of the Christian faith. It is younger than the Muslimcalendar, which in turn, is younger than the Jewish calendar.All of these are considerably younger than the Anunnaki calendar, which is theonly one used by the Anunnaki-Ulema.The Anunnaki-Ulema reject the idea that the week consists of seven days. Theirweek consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of our week. These arethe only days to use in this technique, and the other three days in our weekshould not be calculated upon. II. The Ulema-Anunnaki days are: > • Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday)> • Day 2: Araba (Wednesday)> • Day 3: Jema (Friday)> • Day 4: Saba (Saturday).Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________ The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and thehours in each day. Using the calendar of the Anunnaki-Ulema, each person canfind the luckiest hour of his or her week , according to the Book of Ramadosh(Rama-Dosh). Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week isnot sufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at workif it occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday.This predicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique, TimeManipulation, on that exact hour. The time that will be added to your life undersuch circumstances will be as lucky as the original hour, and your chances ofsuccess will be vastly improved.”The Anunnaki-Ulema teachers highly recommend performing a combination oftechniques, since each enhances the other considerably. III. The calendars’ grids:A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, areall people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour?Yes, indeed they would.There are only sixteen grid lines to represent millions of people each. And thisleads to an interesting discovery.The numbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony that existsbetween them.For example, if you wish to approach someone in high places for a favor, findingthat he or she shares the number of letters and the lucky hour will enhance yourchances.Always send your request to him or her during the lucky hour, either by callingon the phone, using your e-mail, or placing a written letter in the mailbox. IV. The use of a language:Another question is the issue of languages. What if your name is written withfour letters in America, where you live, but with five letters in your nativelanguage? The answer is simple.Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________ Always use your native language, the language that you were first aware of yourname in, in your grid. It will be much more accurate and certainly morepowerful. An important fact to add is that this technique is simple, but it canbe enhanced in many ways by subtle variations. Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space is relatedto luck and success, and how to fine tune the process. But even in thisstraightforward version, the technique is incredibly powerful, so much so thatit may change your life completely, always for the better. Tip: If any added numbers are higher than one digit, always add the numbers anduse the result. For example, if instead of 3+1+1+1= 6 you will find yourselfwith, say, 4+7+7+7=25, add 2+5 and use the result, namely 7. If you have40+41+42+43=126, add 1+2+6=9. V. The preparation and use of the grids:The first step is to prepare a grid of sixteen squares, like the one below. In the next step, you will establish the calendar of the week, by writing themin this specific order. Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________ [Image00125.gif]Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________ > • 1 -In the next step, you will establish the calendar of your lucky hour.> • 2 -Look at the two squares above.> • 3 -Try to find the one square that has the same number in both drawings.> • 4 -When you compare each square, you will see that the second square in the> last raw has the #1 in it.> • 5 -Fill in the number of the days in the first row, the way it appeared in> the first grid. Therefore, Suzan’s lucky hour will occur during the second day. (If more thanone square presents the same number, add the numbers.) [Image00126.gif]*** *** *** In the next step, we shall start our calculations. > • 1 -Keep the first row as is.> • 2 -fill the rest of the grid with the number 1.> • 3 -In each column, you will now subtract the three #1 from the day in the> first row. 1-1-1-1= -2; 2-1-1-1= -1; 3-1-1-1= 0; 4-1-1-1 = 1Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________> [Image00127.gif]Hamnika-mekhakeh- ilmu_________________________________________________ > • 8 -We will combine the individual numbers comprising the number fourteen by> adding them: 1+ 4 = 5> • 9 -We will add these two numbers.

And for theperiod of 17 years, there is a calendar, well structured and divided in asequence of 77 by 7.This brings us to the Anunnaki-Ulema magical-esoteric number of 777, consideredto be the Alpha and Omega of all knowledge and “Tana-Wur”, which meansenlightenment, similar to the Bodhisattva. At one point during the lucky years, a person will acquire two extraordinaryfaculties:> 1. Rou’h Ya> 2. Firasa (Fi raa-Saa).These two faculties will positively influence his/her life and guide him/hereffortlessly toward reaching the highest level of mental and physical strength,as well success in business and varied endeavors.Some of these endeavors for instance, is an astonishing power or capability ofproducing, writing or composing in an exceptional prolific manner.Zaradu (Cont’d)________________________________________________ It also encompass the ability of learning many languages in no time, and readingmanuscripts written in secret languages, such as the first secret and hiddenalphabet (Characters) of the Hindu language.Applied in modern times, reading the secret symbols and alphabets becomeforecasting events and predicting the rise and fall of world’s markets.It was also said, that this 17 year period can alter a DNA sequence, thuspreventing time from succumbing the blessed one (Learned ones) to aging, and thedeterioration of their cells.One of the last Anunnaki-Ulema Mounawirin (Enlightened) known to have discoveredthe secret of the 17 lucky years was Alan Cardec “Allan Cardec” (October 3,1804- March 31, 1869). Cardec’s real name was Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail.And his Ulema name was Asha-Kar-Da-Ki. His mentor was the legendary JohannHeinrich Pestalozzi, also knows as “Mirdach Kadoshi Sirah” in the Anunnaki-Ulemacircle.His incarnated guiding master (Second high level of Anunnaki-Ulema) was AlZafiru, called Sefiro or Zefiro in mediumship and spiritism literature. In fact,the word or term “Spiritism” was coined by Cardec.He was the first to use it and explain its application during a contact with ahigher entity and other rapports with dead people (Trapped deceased persons) whoasked for his help. Sometimes, it was the way around; Cardec asked for theirguidance on matter related to life after death, and the realm of the next life.Cardec was the father of the French movement of Spiritism, and communicationswith entities trapped between the next dimension and Earth’s boundaries.They are called “Les retenus”, meaning those who were trapped in the afterlifedimension, or more precisely, those who were detained.Cardec was burried at the historical French cemetry “ Cimetière du Père Lachaise[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery] ”. The inscription onhis tomb stele reads: \" Naitre, mourir, renaitre encore et progresser sanscesse, telle est la loi.” Translated verbatim: “ To be born, die, to be rebornagain and to progress unceasingly, such is the law.”Araliridu____________________________________________ Araliridu_____________________ One of the most unusual concepts mentioned in the Book of Rama-Dosh. Basically,it means your “other name”; the name you did not know you had, referring to aName-Code given to you by the Khalek (Anunnaki creator), before you were born,and took a physical form on Earth.Ulema Bashir Bin AlFakhri As-Soufi explained this concept as follows, (From hisKiraat, Addendum to the Book of Rama-Dosh):Note: Translated verbatim, word for word, unedited, to preserve its authenticcach é . > • 1 -Your parents gave you a name when you were born.

We call this,Ismu Ardi, meaning a terrestrial name.The Ismu Ardi is not your primordial or original name. Ismu Khalka; your non-Earth name.Searching for your name in Ana’kh. Regardless of your ethnicity, your native tongue, gender or race, you have aname that is written in Ana’kh, which is the Anunnaki’s language. This name is acode; your DNA code.Your name_________________________________________________ In many of the Semitic and ancient Middle Eastern languages, one’s name isusually an adjective; an attribute, rather than a noun. For instance, the nameKabir means big; the name Asad means (courageous as a) lion, and so on.In Ana’kh, names given to people are an attribute, a sort of code. In otherwords, the name refers to attributes and faculties found in your DNA, and storedin the Conduit of your brain, as it was explained to us by the Ulema Anunnaki.This name is called “Ismu Khalka; your non-Earth name, assigned to you by theAnunnaki.Each one of us has a name, that nobody else has. There are many Roberts and manyJanes on Earth, but in the Anunnaki’s realm and in the Bakht (Tarot), there isonly one Jane, and only one Robert. Meaning, if your assigned name is Muktiar,nobody else is called Muktiar. You are the only person in other dimensions whohas the Muktiar name.Why?Because Muktiar or other names assigned to other people are in fact a code, somesort of mathematical-genetic formula. And each person in the Donia (Life,universe, multiverse, etc.) has a different genetic formula and DNA, just likeyour fingerprints. Thus, for each genetic formula, and for each person’s DNA,there is only one name (Code).On Earth, your name could be Albert or Khalid, Lydia or Hind, but in anotherdimension, or in a different world, you have a different name totally unrelatedto the name you have on Earth.You are Albert on Earth, but you are also Shimradu in the next dimension, Rafaatin a parallel dimension, and Kira in a non-bio-organic form of existence. Threedifferent names for the same person, so on.Are Albert, Shimradu and Rafaat the same person?Yes and no.Yes, because all of the three have retained some similar and major propertiesand characteristics, such as the Conduit, the Fikr, the Jabas, etc.No, because all of the three now have different properties, such as new cellularmemory, new molecules, totally different organic substance, more organs, lessorgans, etc.Your name_________________________________________________ The changes occur at so many different levels. For instance, on Earth, you havetwo eyes, while in a different world, eyes are no longer needed to see objects;they have been replaced by other organs or tissues totally inconceivable andincomprehensible to the human mind.And because the new Albert has become a new entity, the future of this newentity becomes diametrically different from the future of a person called Albertwho once upon a time lived on Earth, or is still living somewhere on Earth.Consequently, for each new entity, new person, or a new intelligent life form, anew Bakht has been created. But do not be concerned with this for now. All youhave to do for the moment is to find the name the Anunnaki gave you when youwere first born or conceived.This very name is the one I recommend to use while reading your Bakht and Tarotcharts. Yet, you can still use your Erdi name to read your Bakht and learn a lotabout your future.But you have to remember that by only using your Ismu Erdi, your access to thecomplete file of your future and destiny will not be complete.Nevertheless, what you will or could discover about yourself and your future ismind-boggling. How do I write my name in Ana’kh?How can I find my true name (Code); the one the Anunnaki gave me before I wasborn?It is not easy, but it is possible.> • First, you must equate the letters of your name with the corresponding> letters in Ana’kh/Proto-Ugaritic. Look at the corresponding alphabet chart on> the next page.> • Second, place the letters of your name under each corresponding letter in> the Ana’kh/Proto-Ugaritic; several examples are provided in this book.> • Third: Write your Anakh name from right to left, the way the Anakh language> is written, similar to written Hebrew and Arabic. Your name_________________________________________________ This exercise gives you your name in Ana’kh, and refers you to a pertinentmeaning. However, it does not give you the primordial name (Code), the Anunnakiassigned to you when you were born, even before you were born/conceived in ablueprint. *** *** ***  Your name_________________________________________________ Writing/Equating your name in Ana’kh-Proto UgariticChart of the Latin/Anglo-Saxon Alphabet in comparison with the Ana’kh letters [Image00128.gif] Your name_________________________________________________ [Image00129.gif] Placing the letters of your name under each corresponding letter in theAna’kh/Proto-Ugaritic[Image00130.gif] Your name_________________________________________________ [Image00131.gif] Your name_________________________________________________ R: The numerical value for the letter R is 18.Meaning:1-You are a candidate to play a major role in your field, and leave a huge markin this area.2-You are going to face strong opposition in your most important projects.

No knowledge, no results and nointerpretation should be obtained or caused by coincidence or probability. Eventhough these exercises might appear incomprehensible and/or irrational, the timewill come when you will find out that there are convincing elements, evidenceand logic working behind the Bakht techniques._________________________________________________ Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ Mintaka DifayaProtecting your Zone > • Introduction> • Purpose> • Tools and materials needed> • It works like this> • Follow these instructions> • Step One> • Illustration #1 Mintaka Fasida> • Step Two> • Illustration #2 Mintaka Fasida> • Step Three> • Illustration #3 Mintaka Fasida> • Step Four> • Illustration #4 Mintaka Fasida> • Illustration #5 Mintaka Fasida> • Step Five> • Illustration #6 Mintaka Fasida> • Illustration #7 Mintaka Fasida> • Step Six (Final Stage)> • Illustration #8 Mintaka Fasida *** *** ***   Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ Mintaka DifayaProtecting your Zone _____________________ I. Introduction:Protecting your zone “Mintaka” is a complex and difficult process to understand,but it is not impossible to learn. The Enlightened Masters have their owntechniques, and they are difficult to grasp. But, they taught us some exercisesand techniques we can easily use to protect ourselves against bad energy and thenegative/malicious vibrations of others. Mind you that not all the negative orbad vibrations are always emitted by bad people or those who want to harm to us.In many cases, they come from good friends and relatives, for reasons I havealready explained throughout the book.Nevertheless, we must protect ourselves.Honorable Master Govinda gave us an easy to follow technique. He called it theDinar Tarika. In the Ulemite language, it is called Mintaka Difaya. It iscomposed of two words:a- Mintaka, which means a zone, an area,b- Difaya, which means protection or defense. II. Purpose:With mental visualization and deep concentration, you are to create a field ofcounter-energy to oppose the bad energy and negative vibes of others.> • a- The coin represents your own energy.> • b- The rice paper symbolically represents a field, a zone. You could call> this field your “Etheric Zone”.> • c- The nails or needles represent rods or an antenna to be used to direct,> redirect, oppose or neutralize bad energy and negative vibes.> • d- With the power of your mind, imagination, and concentration, you are to> generate a current on the rice paper that will make the needles or nails move> toward a dot or 2 dots you point at, on the rice paper.Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ > • e- When the nails or the needles get closer to the dot (s), or touch the dot> (s), the rice paper will be charged with a strong positive energy field.> • f- When the rice paper is fully charged, the Mintaka Difaya is> entirely/totally activated.> • g- When the Mintaka Difaya is activated, an etheric belt, an astral/etheric> protection shield will surround you, and/or surround the area where you live,> or wish to stay.> • h- This is what you are going to accomplish; this is the purpose of this> technique. III. Tools and materials needed:> • a- A piece of a rice paper> • b- A coin, any kind, a Dollar coin is just fine> • c-Two nails or two large/thick needles> • d- Ink dots IV. It works like this:Follow these instructions: Step One:> • Look at the Illustration #1 on page 517.> • Place the rice paper on a solid surface, a piece of glass is perfect> • Do not use metal, plastic or a fiberglass surface> • Place the solid surface on your desk, on a regular table, and/or on any> commode, anywhere in your home, but not in the kitchen, foyer, or the bathroom> • Tape firmly the solid surface to the area you are using (Desk, table, etc.)> • But make sure that you can easily remove the solid surface without damaging> the rice paper.> • Later on, at one point during the exercise, you will be required to move the> solid surface to another area in your home> • Wash thoroughly a coin and place it on the rice paper as shown in the> illustration #1 on page 517Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ [Image00133.gif] Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ Step Two:> • Look at Illustration #2 Mintaka Difaya, on page 519> • Place 2 nails above and below the coin, as shown in the illustration> • Make sure the nails are not rusty> • Go now to page 521, and look at Illustration # 3 Mintaka Difaya.> • Read pertinent information and instructions on page 520. *** *** ***  Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ [Image00134.gif]Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ Step Three:> • Draw 2 dots on the rice paper, next to each nail, as seen in Illustration #3> Mintaka Fasida, on page 521> • In next step, you will begin your mental work *** *** ***  Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ [Image00135.gif] Mintaka Difaya_________________________________________________ Step Four:> • Look at Illustration #4 Mintaka Fasida, on page 524.

Remove your hands from the rice paper2. Stamp your right thumb fingerprint on the rice paper as shown in Illustration#8 Mintaka Fasida, on page 5323. Take a deep breath4. Bring back the blue positive vibe and tell your mind to project it over thefingerprint5. You are going to feel that projection mentally. It is a real projection. Moreprecisely, it is a holographic projection, and you are going to see it6. Take a deep breath7. Keep concentrating on your fingerprint for approximately 20 seconds8. Close your eyes for 5 seconds9. Open your eyes. The blue vibe is no longer there, but it has merged insideyour Etheric Zone”, and your fingerprint has sealed your protection shield,meaning that no bad vibes emanated by others will invade your etheric-physicalzone.10. You are protected now11. Remove the solid surface and store it in a safe area, because you might needit again, in case, in the future you feel the need to repeat this technique12. You are done. You have succeeded. I am delighted for you, andcongratulations13.

How it works:Note: These mental-esoteric exercises are not techniques, but simply exercises to testyour psychic abilities, and find out whether you have or have not learned and/ordeveloped psychic, mental, esoteric, and spiritual faculties. However, I willprovide you with brief instructions to guide you on the right path. You shouldconcentrate by visually focusing on the photo. Do not guess! Try to sensevibrations or anything unusual just by touching the photograph. Generalities/Basic stepsThe mental-metaphysical process Follow these instructions:1. First thing to do is to gaze at the center of the photograph for 5 seconds.2. Very slowly look at the upper left side of the photograph for approximately10 seconds3. Very slowly look now at the right side of the photograph for approximately 10seconds4. This will give you a global visual perception of the photograph5. Take a deep breath6. Close your eyes for approximately 5 seconds7. Open your eyes now, learn forward toward the photograph, and place your rightor left palm on the photograph8. Close your eyes for approximately 10 seconds, and try to not think aboutanything. Create inside your mind an absolute state of tranquility9. You can accomplish item #8 by visualizing in front of you a rainbow of amultitude of colors, while your eyes are closed10. If it is difficult to visualize the rainbow, place your left hand above yourhead, press on the photo with your right palm, and take a deep breathEsoteric-Mental practices_________________________________________________ 11. Open your eyes, drop down your left hand, and press on the photograph withyour right palm12. If you are left-handed, do just the opposite13.

[Image00174.jpg] "},{"pageContent":" Most frequently asked questions____________________________________________ Most Frequently Asked Questions Q: Is it necessary to learn the Ana’kh terminology to learn the Anunnaki-Ulematechniques?A: Absolutely. Because the definitions of the words provide additionalinformation on the subject(s), especially those topics that require moredetailed explanation. Q: Do I have to practice everyday to learn the Anunnaki-Ulema techniques?A: No, except for those techniques that require a particular schedule to follow.Some techniques demand a daily practice, while others clearly specify the daysand the hours to use, in order to get the best of these lessons and techniques.Each technique/lesson has its own training pattern and a prescribed schedule. Q: Are there good days and bad days for practicing the Anunnaki-Ulematechniques?A: Yes. Just follow the training schedule, as prescribed in each lesson. Q: Does the presence of others disrupt the learning process?Do I have to be by myself to train on these techniques? A: Absolutely.Do not let others’ vibes enter the place where you are practicing. Some peoplehave negative vibes that will disorient you without knowing it.Practice alone, and always alone. Q: Does an active sex life, smoking and eating meat affect the learning of theAnunnaki-Ulema techniques, and the training processes?A: A healthy marital sex life does not prevent anyone from learning the esotericand paranormal Anunnaki-Ulema techniques. However, extramarital affairs, and anexcessive and abusive sexual behavior and habits will handicap your training andlearning abilities. The mot destructive ones are those professions that feed onsex, that sell sex, and provide what Ulema Ghandar called “Bestial sexualpatterns”.Prostitution, sexually oriented escorts, all demeaning and disgraceful forms ofsex such as domination, orgies, etc., will block your learning process, andprevent your progress. Ironically, smoking habit does negatively affect all thetraining and learning processes.There are some lessons and training sessions that does allow a person to smoke,but not during the learning and training sessions. Follow the particularinstruction of each lesson. Eating meat is a NO NO for the Ulema. Except inforce majeure cases, when eating meat becomes an urgent and absolute necessity,categorically requested and advised by physicians. Q: Are the Anunnaki Ulema techniques of a religious or a spiritual nature?A: No. The Anunnaki Ulema techniques are based upon the science and philosophyof the “Transmission of Mind”. The Ulema do not interfere nor engage themselvesinto religious matter and debates. As a matter of fact, the Ulema teachings andKira’at are inspired by the direct revelations and information provided by theAnunnaki. Religion does not play any paramount role in their Kira’at anddirasaat. Q: Once I have learned the techniques, do I have to keep on practicing thelessons?A: No. Once learned, the lesson will be remembered by your mind. Q: Is it possible to reach any of the Ulema Masters?A: No. The Ulema select their students. The students and adepts are chosen by anEnlightened Master and/or an Ulema Master. The Ulema know who are the righteousones, and who deserves to be admitted to their Ma’had and Kira’at. However, youcan communicate with Ulema Germain Lumiere, and ask for his guidance and advice. Q: Do the Anunnaki-Ulema charge for their teachings or for admittance into theircenters?A: Never. The Anunnaki Ulema teachings are free of charge. Q: Is Maximillien de Lafayette an Enlightened Master or an Anunnaki Ulemateacher?A: Maximillien de Lafayette was chosen by Anunnaki Ulema Master Li and AnunnakiUlema Mordachai ben Zvi as their student. It will take Maximillien de Lafayettehundreds of years to become an Enlightened Master. However, he is one of thechosen Righteous Ones, and thus, the Ulema have considered him as one of theteachers. Q: How many Anunnaki Ulema are still around?A: Only 700. Two hundreds are Mounawariin and Tahiriin. Five hundreds are Ulemafrom the third and fourth levels. Q: Is the Book of Ramadosh written by the Ulema or is it an old Anunnaki’smanuscript found by the Ulema?A: The Book of Ramadosh is an Anunnaki collection of scrolls, tablets andwritten information in Ana’kh, which is the Anunnaki language. It was given tothe Anunnaki Ulema by the remnants of the Anunnaki in the ancient Near andMiddle East. Q: The Book of Ramadosh teaches us 13 Anunnaki Ulema. I assume there are morethan 13 techniques to learn from. Right?A: Absolutely.There are hundreds of Anunnaki Ulema techniques not yet revealed to the generalpublic. The first book was transmitted to us by Maximillien de Lafayette andcontained the original 13 techniques. There is a new book on more techniques,coming very soon. Q: Is there any other book on the Anunnaki Ulema techniques?A: So far, there is only one book, the once you are currently reading. However,there are two books on the subjects “Mouzakaraat Sinhar Marduchk”, written inAnak’h, and “Ilmu Al Donia”, written in archaic Arabic (Pre-Islamic era). Bothbooks shall be translated to English, and published in the United States and inGermany in 2011. Nizrin?Question: What is an Anunnaki’s Nizrin?Answer: Nizrin is the process by which an Anunnaki elevates the contents ofknowledge recently deposited in his/her mind through the “Conduit”. Theascension phenomenon occurs frequently and periodically, so the Anunnakiindividual could catalogue the categories of knowledge recently acquired.Elevating the contents is a mental projection that begins from within thebrain’s cells and materializes on a memory pad that appears before an Anunnaki. La-abridaQuestion: In your book on Ramadosh, you wrote about the Anunnaki andAnunnaki-Ulema La-abrida instrument that gives them the means to foresee thefuture. How would describe for us this instrument, and its mode of operation?Answer: The Anunnaki, and the Anunnaki-Ulema as well, have at their disposal, aninstrument called “La-abrida”, or “Bzi’ra-irdu”, they frequently use to read thepast, the present and the future. It is a rectangular glass table thatresonates, when metallic cards are placed on its surface. The word “glass” ishereby used for lack of proper terminology. The material is transparent likeglass, but the substance is very different, and cannot be described, using ourEarth’s vocabularies.The “metallic cards” represent thin and encoded boards. The word “metallic” ishereby used, for lack of proper terminology.Each card contains sequences of numbers and dots, perforated on one side of eachcard. Misinformed researchers nicknamed the cards “Galactic Tarot”. It isincorrect. The cards project and interpret sequences and passages from anindividual’s life in one particular dimension; one space-time sphere at thetime. Duplicate, and/or multiple projections of different lives in differentdimensions are also possible. However, the projection of any of a person’smultiple lives existing in separate universes has no bearing or any effect onthe current existence in the third dimension.Alteration of past events in a different dimension does not categorically altercurrent events in the third dimension. However, the results and directconsequences of such alteration could and would change the course of life, andevents to occur in the present and the near future of an individual, if theperson’s “Conduit” (Brain cell Conduit) is activated. On Earth, a person couldbe an illustrious writer, while in a second or a parallel dimension; the verysame person is totally illiterate.People and other living-forms live quite differently in other dimensions. OnEarth, a person for instance is a distinguished judge, while in anotherdimension; the very same person is an outlaw. Removing, altering and/or erasinga crime committed by a person in another dimension does not categorically“clean”, and/or delete the “Galactic Record” of that person on the“Conscience-Cosmic-Net”.That person is still held liable for his/her action, and will be punished forhis/her crime.For instance, on Earth (Third dimension), you are 40 year old, while in the sametime, you could be 60 year old, or not even born, in another dimension(Universe). In some dimensions, Alexander the Great is still on his way toancient Persia, and Jesus is not yet crucified. The sequences constitute thecode. The code is the key to a wide variety of information and data aboutindividuals. In other words, each card could be interpreted as a microchip.The microchip stores every single event (Past, present and future) in the lifeof a person, including, duplications of similar or different occurrences onother planes. “Other planes” mean a separate form of existence in a paralleldimension. “Resonate” means responding to the placement of the card upon thesurface of the glass table.“Responding” means, reading and/or deciphering the code (Key to information) ofthe data and information stored in each card. Question: What is the specific mode of operation of this instrument?Answer: La abrida also called “Bzi’ra-irdu”, functions like “Miraya”, “Minzar”,and “Mnaizar”. However, the use of the La-abrida is limited to reading past,present, and future events in the life of one single person. When a card isplaced on the top of the glass table, the card changes properties, shape andform. The “metallic” structural substance of the card becomes translucent, andmerges with the glass surface. To the naked eye, it appears as if the card wastotally absorbed by the glass surface. However, the size of the card remainsintact. The shape of the card becomes circular, but retains its original size,meaning, each card occupies the same space, before the shape was changed. Thus,the form of the card becomes either circular or conical. Almost instantly, conicpages open up on the glass surface of the table.Usually, three to four pages, aligned horizontally. Each page has a distinctcolor, ranging from light green to almost transparent blue. Words, geometricsymbols, dots, and numbers appear on each page.They are the data and information pertaining to the “existence” of one person inmultiple spheres (Separate existences in multiple life-form universes.)This means, that individuals (Humans and animals alike) do live separately andindependently as 4 distinct living persons in 4 distinct dimensions, or more.Contemporary quantum physics theorists totally accept this reality.Many books and articles discussed this incomprehensible phenomenon. The multipleand separate existences (In our case, 4) are called in quantum physicsmembranes, or simply branes. Each membrane represents a separate world, calleddimension in contemporary quantum physics. That dimension refers to “anotheruniverse”.So far, quantum physics theorists have accepted the notion that, there are 11dimensions in our universe. On the glass surface of the La abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”,the adept will be able to see (In miniature) four different dimensions.Each one of them, containing a duplicate (Identical or totally different) ofhimself or herself, his or her total life, habitat, physical appearance,preoccupations, and environment.In other words, the adept is watching simultaneously his or her other fourexistences/lives in four separate universes.This concept has become a major part of the modern study and research ofcosmology, and quantum physics, usually discussed under various theories, suchas the “Multiverse”, the “M Theory”, the “String Theory”, the “MembranesTheory,” so on.The beginning of everything: Multiples existences and “God’s Particle”. UlemaHaroon Bakri bin Rached Al Ansari, and Ulema Mordechai ben Zvi provided thefollowing explanation.Herewith reproduced verbatim, word for word, and unedited. Taken from theirKira’at (Readings), Kiramat Ketab (Book of the good deeds), Hadith (Speech;dialogue) and Rou’ya (Visions; insight):Time is not linear. Thus, the landscape of so called time and space is not thesame in other worlds. In multiple universes, the past, the present, and thefuture are all contained in one particle. This particle is the “Cell ofEverything”. This means, everything that has existed before, and shall existafterward. It is the origin of the creation. The particle is the beginning ofeverything that is everlasting. Quantum physics theorists call this cell orparticle the “God’s Particle”.In this cell, you will find all the “Bubbles” (Term used by modern cosmologists)that collided together to create all the universes, galaxies, and planets in thecosmos.Who created the God’s Particle?Who created the universe?Who created time?Who created “God”?Is there one single Creator who created everything in the universe, includinghumans and non-humans? The God’s particle was at the beginning of everything.And everything was not in existence. Thus, before the particle, time did notexist, space did not exist, the past did not exist, the future did not exist,humans did not exist, and religions did not exist; in brief nothing existed.The Universe was not created by one single creator. The universe was not createdby a “Big Bang.” The universe emerged from itself, from within. And when, thenothingness of existence of all forms and substances suddenly collided withitself, the whole universe exploded into billions and billions of stars,galaxies, planets, and layers of dimensions.In some universes, the coagulation of time with the landscape of space createdtime. When time was created by the collision of universes (Bubbles), galaxiesand universes took shape and place in the cosmos.On some planets, and in some galaxies, photosynthesis, metabolism, followed bymicro-biological evolution created multiple life-forms everywhere.Some of these life-forms produced all kinds and shapes of organic and botanicsubstances, stones, mountains, gases, waters, atmospheres. In some dimensions,different intelligent life forms were created. We call this intelligentlife-form “Kir-Ra-Ibra”, meaning the faculty of reasoning and creating.The primordial intelligent life-form belonged to very advanced galactic racesinhabiting billions of stars and planets. Billions of years later, the humanrace was genetically created by some of these very advanced intelligentlife-forms, such as the Anunnaki, Igigi, and Lyrans.When pre-humans, proto-humans, and quasi-human began to populate the Earth, timedid not exist at that point in history.Later, much later, when the Lyrans, Igigi, and the Anunnaki commenced toexperiment with the archaic human species (They were 47 different categories),they installed in the brain of the human beings, some form of intelligence. Someearly humans were fortunate to receive the “Conduit”, the invisible cell in thebrain that produces all sorts of human activities and thoughts.When the early human beings began to reason, the notion of time was conceived.Thus, “Time” became the invention of humans. Time exists on Earth, not on otherdimensions. Time travelQuestion: La-abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”, is it a tool to go back in time or jump intothe future? Is it physical or ethereal?Answer: No, because, if you want to go back in time, and/or visit the future,you have to depart from this dimension (Earth), where you currently live. Once,you are outside the perimeter of the third dimension (Earth), time bends onitself. Space bends on itself. And you are caught in the middle. However, youcan escape this dilemma, and realign yourself, following the cadence/rhythm ofall dimensions beyond the third one. How, will you accomplish this? We willelaborate on this, when we study the “Parallel Synchronization.” Since time doesnot exist, the enlightened ones (Many of you are enlightened) will be able towatch themselves living separately in different worlds. This is what La abrida“Bzi’ra-irdu” does. It allows you to “see” not to revisit the past or jump intothe future, unless your “Conduit” is fully activated.Once you are outside the physical realm ( Panet Earth), you immediately connectwith the beginning of everything in the universe. You become part of “God’sParticle.”However, and as we have explained before, revisiting the so-called past ispossible if you use the Gomatirach Minzari.But bear in mind, you are not visiting, but transposing yourself, unless your“Conduit” is fully activated. Can we change the future?Question: Can we use this instrument to change our future?Answer: Master Kanazawa said yes! He added, “however, you cannot alter the lawsof cause and effect; something similar to what you call Karma, but in reality,it is quite different from Karma, because there is no place for reincarnation inthe world of the Anunnaki.The Anunnaki’s norms remain universal, although they are norms per se, but notnecessary cosmic laws.” Master Kanazawa continued, “On Earth, you areaccountable for all your actions. The same applies in all the dimensions,realms, and spheres of time, and space. However, in a different form ofexistence, or dimension, the nature and understanding of certain moral andethical laws might change considerably. Such change has a paramount effect onthe level of enlightenment and happiness you wish to reach. On Earth, we havewhat we call the human law, the natural law, and dogma establishing acceptablebehavior in societies and communities. These laws quite often change in virtueof our understanding of what is right, and what is wrong.They also change, as time changes, as our form of government changes, as amajority’s power and influence change, regionally and nationally. Nothing istruthfully permanent on Earth. In the galactic perimeter of advanced and“spiritual” communities, values do not change.They are permanent and universal, and they govern the general conduct oflife-forms and intelligent entities, in the entire universe. If you enter aparticular dimension, far away from Earth, or too close to Earth, you mightencounter social rules that are in sharp contrast with laws on Earth. This couldconfuse your mind, and prevent you from understanding and/or recognizing what isright, and what is wrong.If this should happen to you, you will not be able to ameliorate your life, andchange your destiny, when you return to Earth, and/or to the present. Somethingelse you should take into consideration.What kind of destiny, success, happiness, prosperity and advancement are youtalking about? Are they those your are aiming at, upon returning to Earth, orthose you are seeking after death? Or, possibly those that exist in a dimensionclose to Earth? The Anunnaki-Ulema can simultaneously live in two or threedifferent dimensions, and coordinate their actions via the “Conduit”. We callthis, the “Universal Conduit”. Humans have not yet reached a level of moralityand “spirituality” that allows them to live and relive in separate dimensions atthe same time.Although, some humans might be invited to visit another dimension and acquire agreat deal of knowledge, wisdom, and even supernatural powers, upon their returnto Earth, they will instantly forget whatever they have learned, heard and seen,unless they are spiritually developed, and guided by the enlightened ones. Thus,in order to ameliorate you destiny, prosper in your endeavors, and preserve agood health, you must be able to differentiate between what is right and what iswrong, at a galactic level.You must become acquainted with the universal truth; the galactic harmony ofthings. Truth in the “outer cosmos” is quite different from the truth you findon Earth. Only your activated “Conduit” will allow you to do so.There are also certain measures and requirements you must consider and complywith, before you leave Earth and enter another dimension, and/or time-spacesphere.For instance, selecting the correct time to revisit the past, and/oranother dimension is paramount. What “Ba’ab” (Door or entrance to the otherworld) shall you enter?How shall you adapt, correct or adjust your vision in a new dimension? How wouldyou differentiate between an astral travel, imagination, fantasy of your mind,and reality?Even in highly developed dimensions, and in many different time/space spheres,you will encounter fantasy, tricks of the mind, hallucinations, and fakeapparitions. Many of the other dimensions (Plans) and time-space spheres aresimilar to Earth, even though the structural composition and their propertiesare enormously different.All these encounters, images and feelings will prevent your mind fromunderstanding what you are seeing. You will be totally confused. For example,and let’s assume for now, that you have managed to go back in time, and visitwith people and societies from the 18th century. First, how would you know, thatthe people you will see there are indeed from the 18th century, and not peoplejust like you, visiting the past for the first time?Second, how would you guide yourself, direct yourself, and reach yourdestination, without getting lost? Bear in mind, that in a different dimension,you will not have enough time to find your way around, if you don’t have the mapof the afterlife, and parallel dimensions. Third, you will not be able to lastlong over there, because your mind and your body will run out of energy.Besides, do you know how to charge and/or recharge yourself? You will be facingincomprehensible situations similar to ectoplasmic apparitions.Quite often , these ectoplasmic apparitions and projections (Complete orpartial) dissipate because the entity has rapidly consumed its “apparition andmanifestation energy.”Once you have completed your orientation program, and the master has activatedyour “Conduit”, your trip to the past or to another dimension will be successfuland very beneficial. The Dividing Lines of Multiple and Parallel DimensionsQuestion: You wrote about some lines or frontiers that link humans to otherdimensions.Are these lines a doorway to another life, or simply, a stargate?Answer: These lines or graphs refer to as the invisible borders of multipleadjacent zones of existences, also called multiple dimensions, and/or paralleluniverses.You can call them the dividing lines of multiple and parallel dimensions. TheAnunnaki- Ulema call these lines “Kalem”. These lines serve also as a path or apassage that lead to a higher sphere of knowledge.From Kalem, derived the Hebrew word Kailem, which literally means, vessels orvehicles; the vases for the source of the Waters of Life, used in the TenSephiroth, and considered as the primeval nuclei of all Kosmic Forces.Some Kabalists and occulists stated that these lines or vessels appear in ourworld, through twenty two canals, which are represented by the twenty-twoletters of the Hebrew alphabet, “thus making with the Ten Sephiroth 32 paths ofwisdom.”According to Anunnaki-Ulema Li, “The world of humans is linked to the afterlifethrough twenty two Kalem (Graphs). Some of these graphs or lines are directlyattached to the “Conduit” implanted in the human brain, thus a trained adept canenter and exist other dimensions by placing himself or herself on one of the“tracks” of these lines.” Living in dimensions designed by the Anunnaki.Question: Do we live in dimensions according to what the Anunnaki have created?Answer: This is one of the most frequently asked questions by novices andstudents. Generally, the Ulema are not concerned with issues of a metaphysicalnature, because they do not believe that the physical world is completelyseparated from the non-physical world. They do not see the universe the way wedo.Therefore, everything is part of something else. An Ulema once said, talking to a student:> • 1. Even this rock and this tree leaf are part of you. We are made of the> same material.” (Author’s note: This could be interpreted metaphorically, but> there is a deep scientific veracity attached to it.)> • 2. Yes, a rock is a rock. It is physical. It is real. You can touch it and> you can weight it.> • 3. But that’s not all…it is not all of it, because it has an additional> dimension you can’t see with your eyes. It does not start and end where you> start to touch it, and where you finish touching it.> • 4. Once, your “Rou’ya” (Third Eye to others) opens up, you begin to see a> larger size of the rock, and discover its hidden properties…> • 5. This is why we call Earth, the life we live, our desires and our> ambitions ILLUSION.”> • 6. Yes, you live in physical and non-physical dimensions according to what> the Anunnaki have created… Note: I will mention herewith parts of his answers that are related to thequestion:> • 7. The Anunnaki have created you on Earth to serve their needs.> • 8. Their intentions were to create a race that could carry heavy physical> load and do intense physical labor.> • 9. This was the initial and prime objective.> • 10. Thus, the “Naphsiya” (DNA) they put in all of you had limited lifespan,> and mental faculties.> • 11. Later on, they discovered that they had to prolong the human lifespan> and add more mental faculties, so they added the “Hara-Kiya” (Internal energy> or physical strength).> • 12. Few generations later, the early human beings stock evolves> considerably, because the Anunnaki added fully operational Mind in the human> body.> • 13. To do so, the Anunnaki installed into your brains, a Conduit with> limited capabilities.> • 14. In the same time, this Conduit was also installed into the prototype of> the human body.> • 15. Thus, through the Mind, the physical body of the humans got linked to> the Double.> • 16. This non-physical link created a Fourth dimension for all of you.> • 17. In fact, it did not create a Fourth dimension per se, rather it> activated it.> • 18. So now, at that stage, human beings had a physical dimension (Life on> earth), and not-a-totally separated non-physical dimension (Zone) called> “Nafis-Ra” on the ethereal level.> • 19. So, yes, Bashar (Humans) became destined to acquire two dimensions, as> exactly the Anunnaki decided.> • 20. Later on, centuries upon centuries, the human mind began to evolve,> because the other Mind, call it now the Double or prototype began to evolve> simultaneously and in sync.> • 21. The more the prototype (First specimen of mankind) is advanced, the more> “Physical Mind” becomes alert, creative and multidimensional.> • 22. But you are not trapped, and your mind is no longer conditioned by the> Anunnaki.> • 23. The Anunnaki gave you all the choices, opportunities, free will, and> freedom to learn on your own, decide on personal matters, select and progress.> • 24. This is why you are accountable and responsible for everything you do> and think about.> • 25. Because of the evolution of your mind, the realization (From within) of> an inner and deeper knowledge of your surroundings, and understanding what is> right and what is wrong, a major mental faculty emerged in all of you. You> have called it: Conscience. *** *** ***> From the present to the future.Question: How do the Masters, the Mounawiriin, and the Anunnaki Ulema transposeyou from the present to the future?Answer: Our brain cannot understand the concept of time-space-future. It is avery difficult concept to grasp.But the Supersymetric Mind does. One of the Masters said verbatim, “Let me makeit easy on you, I will give you an example. You are boarding a train withfriends, and the train will make many stops. Some of your friends will get outof the train at station a, others at station b, and others at station c, so on.You stay on the train. You do not exit at station a, b, or c. You stay insidethe train, until the train reaches the last destination. That’s the last stop ofthe station. By staying inside the train and not getting out of the train at anystop until the last one, you have seen much more than all of your friends did.Note: The Master is interrupted by a question from a novice. Question: Basically you stopped along the way at each train station, but you didnot get off the train until the last stop, or final destination of the train. Soall you saw on your journey, because you did not get off and explore is varioustrain stations for a few minutes.Answer of the Master: That’s correct, but it does not matter whether you havestayed inside the train, or got off and saw what was going on at each station.You have assumed that the person who stayed inside the train, and did not getoff the train, and did not explore what was going on at each station, has alimited knowledge or no knowledge at all of what happened at each station. Thisis how human beings reason and rationalize things.But this is the wrong way to explain things, because you are thinkinggeographically, and in linear time. Don’t tell yourself that because you didn’tget off the train, therefore, you have missed lots of things and did not seewhat was going on at each stop. On a linear chronology of time-distance-space,it is true. Now think like this: You have reached the last stop, the finaldestination of the train. At this last station, you can rewind your journey onthe train backward. And there is a technique to rewind yourself and the time youhave spent on the train, a technique you can learn from the Anunnaki Ulema.It is neither the right time, nor the right place to talk about this technique.Instead, focus on what I am about to tell you. In your mind, try to remember allthe stations, and all the stops the train made. It is a very simple exercise.What you are doing now is rewinding your trip backward. And you are going to beamazed, that this simple exercise will make your mind remember everything or atleast many things you have seen briefly at each station. But in fact, your brainis going to reveal much more than that. Your brain or more precisely yoursymmetric mind has a much bigger memory. A symmetric mind is the original copy of your physical brain. And it is part ofyour double or astral body. This symmetric mind records and stores everythingyou saw. And if your Conduit is active or open, it will remind you of everythingyou have seen, felt or learned. Do not get confused with the concept of theSymmetric Mind. Forget about it for now. But remember, or try to accept theidea, that while you are not aware of the existence of a symmetric mind that youhave had since you were born, your symmetric mind is a magnificent recordingdevice, and a very powerful camera.Your Symmetric Mind has gathered information from every stop, almost everythingyou have not seen or heard. Who is rewinding back your journey on the train? Isit your memory? You mind? Yourself? Or something else?None of the above. It is your symmetric mind. Once again, don’t worry about yoursymmetric mind. Let’s go back to the last stop of the train. You are there now.Good. Let’s now equate this last station with a date, a time frame, a year, acertain time, any time you want. For example, let’s choose the year 2021. Thisyear represents the 7 th station – the final stop of the train. If you go backin time, (in fact we are going back into the future), we will return to the 1ststation. And let’s call this first station, the year 2015Note: Once again, the Master was interrupted by a novice who asked thisquestion:Why did you choose 7 stops? Why not 5 stops? The Master answered the questionand continued his explanation. He said that it is just an example; it does notmatter whether we choose 7 stops or 5 stops. It does not make any difference atall. You can also assign any year to any station, as long as you do itchronologically. He continued by saying: Let’s go back now to the 7 th station,and continue to regress to the 6 th station, the 5 th station, and so on.Note: Once again, the Master was interrupted by a novice who asked thisquestion: As we regress, do we record down what we are doing? Do we write downthe number of the station and corresponding year? The Master continued hisexplanation. He said, no, you do not. Your mind is going to take care of this.But before he had finished his answer, a student asked the Master this question:Are we seeing the stations as a film?How are we seeing this regression and station by station?Is it like a movie?Are we zooming ourselves into the future like a time machine?The Honorable Master answered the question and continued his explanation. Hesaid, no, it is not like that. If the Conduit is active, a huge reading screenwill be displayed within the mind. And the brain will instantly read what it isdisplayed and written on the screen. The screen is not to be understood as aphysical screen like the one we see in movie theaters.It is a mental projection of everything the Conduit has stored inside our brain.The screen can be seen through introspection. To understand this, think aboutyour memory; how you remember things, and how you see them in your mind. Youdon’t have to tell yourself, I have to project everything I saw or knew beforemy eyes, on a huge screen, and look at the screen to see if I can find what Iwant to remember, and that particular event that happened a long time ago, but Ican’t remember everything about it.Your brain does it for you, and you don’t need to know how your brain does it,to remember things, and that event you were interested in. The same thingapplies here with your Conduit and the screen it projects before you eyes. Infact, it does not project events on a screen before your eyes, but right insideyour brain. Do we zoom ourselves into the future like a time machine? No.Then, a student asked: If he didn’t need a spaceship, a Merkaba, or something,nothing then is required to zoom into the future?The Master answered: A spaceship is needed if you want to physically enteranother dimension, or visit a parallel world, where time-space memory remainsintact, and all information is preserved. Nothing is lost in the future, noteven in the Black Holes. Spatial memory and time memory are not lost, becausethey constitute cosmic information. And information and data are never lost inthe universe. Yes, a spaceship is needed to explore the universe. But it is notrequired if you want to see the future and/or zoom in a zone where all eventsfrom the past, present and future are recorded and preserved. In our case, yourConduit or symmetric brain is your spaceship. Do you want to go to Jupiter or toMars? Well then you need a spaceship. But this becomes a physical means. Whenyou zoom into the future using your Conduit, this zooming or travel is mental.And the area you reach is also mental. But if your brain remains attached towhere you are (Sitting in a physical place), you can’t go to the future.Humans see the future through distance, time, and space. We call this the “Wheelof the universe.” And we must be outside the wheel of time to see the future. A student asked: “So, we are seeing time as a wheel? And by doing so, could wesee the future?The Master replied: There are two wheels. The wheel of the universe, which iscalled the Macro wheel, and a smaller wheel called the Micro wheel, whichrepresents us, human beings, here on earth, and our time cycle here on earth. Itis a wheel within the universe. Humans can’t see the Macro wheel, but it doesexist on a large scale. As long as, we are on the inside of the Micro wheel, wewill never be able to see the future. The future belongs to the Macro wheel. Inthe Macro wheel, everything is stored, the past, the present and the future.You can physically reach the Macro wheel, either by using a spaceship that canbend or alter time-space, or by using your Conduit. The Anunnaki Ulema and theenlightened masters can easily reach the Macro wheel physically and mentally bygetting outside the Micro wheel, while others (the rest of us), only mentally.Another student asked this question: And how do we get outside the wheel?The Master replied: There is a technique only known to the enlightened ones(Tahiriin, masters, some Rouhaniyiin, and the Anunnaki Ulema). This technique ispart of the secret teachings of the Anunnaki Ulema. It is never revealed tooutsiders. They teach it only to their students in the Ma’had. It is one oftheir most powerful faculties. The Ulema would say, we don’t predict the future,we don’t see the future, we read the future. A student asked: Is it because thefuture is already there?The Master replied: Yes, the future is already there. The future is alreadyMaktoub (what is written). And the Anunnaki Ulema can read anything that isMaktoub. In the Maktoub, you will find everything and anything that is closelyrelated to your fate and future. And there is nothing you can do to change it oralter it.Your future has been decided upon, the day, the hour, you were born. However,you can modify the results, outcomes and consequences of events to occur in yourfuture. We shall talk about this in another Kira’at. Let’s go back now to whatwe were talking about: How to see a projected future that is occurring in thepresent. A projected future occurring in the present. Let me give you an example. There are two movie theaters in town. People went toa movie theater at 6:00 PM. Let’s call this theater “Theater A.” The film endsfor example at 8:00 PM at theater A. The projectionist is projecting the film onthe big screen from the end, meaning backward. At “Theater B”, people arewatching the same movie. But at theater B, the projectionist is projecting thefilm from the beginning, like projectionists do all the time. Also at theater B,the film ends at 8:00 PM.Both viewers will spend two hours at either theater, but here we have somethingvery special and irregular, because the people who are watching the film at twodifferent theaters are not seeing the same frames (Scenes from the film)chronologically. Those who are seeing the film from the end are already ahead ofthose who are watching the film from the beginning; yet, both have spent thesame amount of time at the movies theaters. But at a certain point, they willarrive at the same time where they will be seeing the same frame, whether thefilm is projected from the beginning or from the end.This is very possible, if the time of projecting the film in theater A, andtheater B is synchronized. Otherwise, it will not happen.And this moment is very crucial, because it determines the time-space thatseparates the past from the future.But don’t get confused now with this very specific moment, because you are goingto understand it as I keep talking to you.Those who watched the film beginning from the end, already knew the end of thefilm, which could be compared to the “future” of the film. Those who watched thefilm from the very beginning are not there yet, as they have not yet reached theend of the film, which we have called the “future” of the film, because the endof the film is going to happen in the future, even though this future is lessthan two hours away.Anunnaki Ulema Mordachai said, let’s call the people who are at theater A,Anunnaki or Anunnaki Ulema. And those who went to theater B, let’s call themhuman beings. These two theaters can be located anywhere, Paris, Boston,Budapest, the location is irrelevant, only TIME is a major factor here. Now, theAnunnaki or Anunnaki Ulema at theater A, ask the projectionist tofast-forward/project the film very very fast, as fast as he can, and if he cando it in seconds, it would be much better. And then, they ask the projectionistto re-project the film from the beginning to the end equally as fast.This means, that they have rapidly seen the whole film from the end to thebeginning, and from the beginning to the end.They saw the future of the film (the End), and revisited the end of the film (intheir future) in the same seating. Think about it for a few seconds.There isalso a third scenario, more fascinating than the previous one.The Anunnaki and the Anunnaki Ulema do not need to go to theater B and rewindthe film (Equated with time-Space) backward to reach the future and revisit thebeginning and the end of the film (Equated with time-Distance), because they arealready there, at the end of the film, which can be equated with the FUTURE, azone where the past, present and future co-exist concurrently, separately,continuously, and instantly.They are already THERE, because time for them is not a line of distance, space,and speed, and how much it would take to reach the end of the line. Beingoutside the line (Outside the Wheel of Time), the Anunnaki can see everythingthat is happening inside and outside the wheel.Once you are outside the wheel, time and distance cease to exist separately. Andwhen this happens, you are immediately within the future. And since the futureis a continuation of the present, and the present is a continuation of the past,you are now simultaneously in the past, the present and the future at the sametime. At first, it is very difficult for our mind to understand this concept.The more you think about time as measured by distance, and vice versa, the moreyou distance yourself for a readable future you can foresee, read, andunderstand. Question from Bernard P.:I am so curious to know what really does happen to a person during a Master’sséance?Is it a healing session or mind training?Answer:There are several kinds of séances, and an avalanche of reasons for conducting aséance. It would take me weeks to provide you with all the answers, and mostcertainly volumes upon volumes. Your question was very timely.I have just received an assignment report sent to me by a dear friend who wassubject to a very short mental/metaphysical séance I conducted myself.The answers to your questions can be found in the report.Date: November 19, 2010Begin: 8:02pmEnd of Séance: 8:14pmLocation: The author’s residence.End of Discussion: 9:00pm (not sure of the exact ending time)Key/Legend :Black Text – Present Séance DiscussionM: Maximillien de Lafayette.P: The person for whom the séance was created. Green Text – Post Séance DiscussionRed Text – Questions Regarding Discussion/ TextHere is the report as received. It is unedited, As Is.Séance #1 of 8:I arrived just about 1 or so minutes after 8pm and quickly sat down on thecouch. Max briefly explained what was going to happen during the séance so Iknew what to expect. He explained:• We are going to do a séance. They use to do this all the time, with peoplearound in the open (?) the would just close their eyes. This (or these)technique(s) have been around for a very long time (or since ancient times).P: As Maximillien was saying this, I visualized a group of people (mostly, ifnot all, men, I believe) in an open market sitting near a well or on an areawith stone steps or on the group, in what appeared to be the biblical times.Well, I assumed that as I imagined a guy wearing some sort of turban thing?Someone was at the head of the circle or in front of the group guiding them.Although I didn’t see him, I had an awareness that).• I will ask you 3 questions. Ask 1 question at a time and they will answer.• We do not know who will show up. It may be your guide, spirit…etc…• It is very Important to remember what is said- everything, every detailverbatim so I can analyze it later.I will not remember anything.• I want you to know, I will not remember anything that is said. So don’t worryabout what is said during the Séance. (You are like a daughter to me. Think ofme as your father. You can say (tell me) anything).• Then, I will tell you to keep your eyes closed. Remember what you see. It’simportantto leave the physical world. Don’t pay attention to anything in the physical. Ifyou do and don’t let go of the physical, you will not be able to go anywhere.You will stay here and I can’t do anything (or nothing will happen). So, useyour imagination. • We will meet 1x a week for 8 weeks. This will be the first of 8 sessions. Andthen, you are on your own.> P: [Thinking: Wow, do this on my own? How could I possibly know all this in 8sessions... let alone speak/ remember the ancient words to summon the spirits,especially if a less than favorable(s) comes through and decides to show up?][Feeling: I felt just a little small by that thought ?]> • The first session will be 10 minutes and each session will increase in time aswe go on. (Maximillien gave more specific information regarding time. However, Ido not recall the increasing amount of lengths going forward).> I quickly changed into my white Dobok uniform and layed on the floor, as Maxasked. At the same time, he turned off all the lights in the apartment, closedthe blinds, and lit a white candle on the table beside the ground where I laid.Max began by adjusting my feet, so my toes were pointed toward the ceiling andpalms were placed flat on the ground. He asked me to keep my hands there(something about ground me?Not exactly sure but I remember either thinking or hearing Maximillien whispersomething about grounding?)He asked me to stay in this position for 1 minute. One minute after, Maximillienbegan his incantation. Within what seemed to be just seconds, he (my firstsession) began:M: Just relax. Take a deep breath in and relax. Breathe into your chest andrelax.P: [Feeling: At first, I felt a little nervous, and tension in my shoulders. Ibegan breathing deeply into my chest and then started to relax more and moreeach time].M: We are in the presence of a Master, a high level master (or senior master),who is here joining us-P: [Thinking: Thank You Master for coming and Max too! I was very excited theMaster appeared and wondered who the Master was! I am still excited typing thisas if my life is finally starting to get on track! Finally. I feel so happy andso blessed by that and for that very kind help!][Feeling: grateful and HAPPY for the opportunity ].[Physical Body: Felt twitching in my right leg and foot- moving or shifting.Later I felt some twitching on my upper leg, almost in my hip area]M: Close your eyes and keep them closed.M: What is your name? (Not sure if this question was asked before or after youtold me my name for the séances is Nu ra?)P: Di…P.M: [Incantation]. The Master who is here, you will eventually be able to seehim, as long as you are on the path of Goodness.P :[Thinking: WOW- that’s GREAT! I’m more ready now][Feeling: Happy!]M: From now on, during each séance, your name will be (or you will be called)Nur ra which means light.P: Num raM: (No). Nur raP: Nur ra ?[Thinking: WOW- that’s cool! I liked the name. It felt beautiful as I said itand heard/felt it]M: Nur raP: Nur raM: You will ask two questions. Make it simple and only one question at a time.What question do you want to ask?P: What is the purpose I am suppose to be doing in my life and …etc…?M: Ask only one question at a time. Keep it simple.P: What is my life purpose?[Thinking as I asked the questions: Why am I here- on earth?]M: Your purpose is simply for healing humans or human-beings. That’s it. Do youknow what healing means or what it means to heal?P: Healing means transferring energy to help care for a person’s physical bodyand also support and share energy to help with their emotional self[Thinking: Ever since I was a child, I always wanted to learn how to HEAL. And,I was always attracted to healers. I met them my whole life.And each time I did it ignited a spark inside me! I have such a passion andstrong connection with wanting to learn as much as I can and help people in thatway.[Feeling: Surprised and not so surprised by the response that I came to heal.And yet, I was surprised by the response because it was so simple and so trueand direct. It felt so true /right. And right to me]M: I’m going to tell you what healing means. Can you remember it or rememberthis and don’t forget it? Healing means removing (or taking away) the pain fromthe physical body and comforting their mental body (or self). Do you understand?P: YesM: Can you remember that?P: Yes.MAX: What is your next question?P: Can you identify the blockages in my body and help with my body and bodyalignment?M: Only one question. Can you ask your question again?P: Can you identify the blockages and (help) heal my physical body?[Feeling: A little embarrassed/ selfish to ask them for healing].M: It will take 1 (or 2) more sessions. You have 5 major knots that arose frominstances in your life which caused you to close (or shut down).The first knot occurred at age 13 and it lasted from 13-15. It had a deepemotional impact on you. This was the first time that such an instance occurredthat had such an impact on you (your life). Do you remember this (event)?P: Yes.[Physically: Felt twitching in my right leg, hip and thigh. Also my left foot.At some point, I also felt something in my chest on the left side]M: It was from age 13-15.P: Yes. [Post Séance Session: (Referring to the event that caused the knot).I shared with Max the event that had a very big impact on me was when my fathertold me he was married before my mother. One day, after his gold outing he had afew drinks. My father hardly ever drank let alone coming home tipsy- that waspretty much un heard of, when decided to share the story.While sitting at the dinner table the subject happened to come up and he sharedhe was married before and had two children- a boy and a girl (N…, Jr. and G…). Ipretended that it was no big deal; however, the reality was, it was a very BIGshocked that Friday.So, spent much of the rest of the weekend in my room crying. I kept looking atthe brighter side saying, wow now I have another sister. But inside I felt alittle angry I was never told before and betrayed. Later I found out my motherwanted to tell me much earlier but my father thought it wasn’t such a good idea-perhaps it was his pride or to protect us?Nevertheless, I never thought my father was married to anyone besides my mother-let alone finding out I know have two new siblings. But the biggest shocker camewhen I found out that the woman who was my sister was someone I had met on manyoccasions at my grandmother’s house. And, I knew her as the wife of my friendsuncle.The most amazing things was that instantly I had a love for this woman. I lovedher in a familial way- a way I can’t explain except to say I felt her in myheart. And, I wanted to get to know her more- after all she was my sister]M: Ok great. Cleared. The second knot occurred at the age of 22 and had a deepimpact on you.Do you remember this or something at (the age of) 22?P: YES, but I recall it being at 21 or 20 when it happened…M: 21-22. Do you re-call this?P: Yes [Post Séance Discussion: (Referring to the event that caused the knot).When I was only 20 years old I went to Florida for Spring Break with my friend.My friend liked this guy and his friend liked, or was infatuated by/with me(possibly my energy).I think the guy put something, like a drug, in my drink; although I was drinkinga lot myself, I was completely paralyzed and he took advantage of me. Only ashort time later I realized I was pregnant and chose to abort the baby because Ididn’t have the strength or courage to carry the baby. I felt guilty and weakabout not being able to carry the baby into the world. M: Ok great cleared. Only 1 more for now. The third knot was 5 years (later)?And it was a time (or at the time) you were questioning if you were a female oryour female-ness? Do you recall this?P: No. (I heard the word female or female-ness, not human or human-ness?) [Post Séance Discussion: (Referring to the event that caused the knot).During the review, Maximillien mentioned what I heard, “it’s impossible”. Theynever use gender specific words such as female or male. Did they say (or mean)Human? They must have meant Human?] M: So you don’t remember this?P: No. (I thought you said 5 years old; not 5 years after, the age of 22)M: So, you don’t remember this?P: No, not really; but, it does sound familiar?M: Ok good.P: There is a spirit here with us?[Imagined: Saw a deep red or red-ish color] [Post Séance Discussion:I asked Max if it was my brother in law. Max said, “Yes”. He was attached toyou, draining your energy. That is why you are so tired. He is stuck. We need tosend (help) him back (to the White Light) (Don’t remember what word Max usedexactly to explain this). Max mentioned we can send him back in the next or oneof the next séances]M: Close your eyes tight, squeeze them tightly.What do you see? Colors, images… we are going on (or to take) a journey…See a double (of yourself) standing on your forehead- feet on your forehead.There is no weight- weightless. Close eyes tight. Squeeze your eyes. ImagineyourselfP: [Thinking: I remembered Max explaining to me, before we started, that I haveto let go of the physical world and let my imagination go. Otherwise, we won’tgo anywhere. We’ll just stay in the physical world (here) So, I reminded myselfto let go and let my mind wonder][Visualized: I could see myself, in my imagination, standing up-right, feet onmy forehead looking down onto my body. I could see from my POV from the groundlooking up (at me) ]> [Post Séance Discussion:P: (To Max) When you asked us to close my eyes I saw dots, like little circlesof color moving around. The color was like deep midnight colors- like dark blue,dark purple (violet) …very dark colors…M: You saw that?P: Yes.M: You saw the bubbles that means (or so you…) … (you said something else but Ican’t remembering it right now)P: Yes. They were more like amebas moving around. And the colors were more dark][I imagined myself on the very top of a green, grass-filled hill top, lookingout at the landscape. It was a Wide shot and I could see myself from head totoe- I believe I had on a coat and boots- not sure. I was standing in a full ½profile]> [Post Séance Discussion: I described the grassy-hill …P: (I described the scene of the grassy-hill to Max)M: Did you know this place? Had you been there before?P: I don’t know exactly where it was but it felt familiar. It felt (or I felt)like home.M: (Smiled & nodded his head)P: When you first started talking and saying we were going on a journey I wentto the grassy-hill. Then, you said we’re going to the beach. So, I went to thebeach.Then after you mentioned the hill. And I went back to the same hill I saw whenwe first started- even before you mentioned going there]M: We’re going to the beach (now)…P: [Visualized: Wide shot, ¾ profile of myself sitting on the beach with myknees bent and feet in the sand. I may have had a white hat on? The water was tothe left and the sandy dunes to the right.]M: There is a friend who you haven’t seen in a long time.P: I was 11. This friend is coming to see me?Maximillien: She is (standing) right next to you…P: [Imagined my friend Adrienne standing next to me looking down. Her name wasthe first thing I thought of when he said you’re with a friend. I was lookingout at the water with my arms renting on my knees. I was not looking at her]M: Do you know this friend?P: Yes. [Post Séance Discussion:Adrienne is my oldest friend. We grew up together in the same Italianneighborhood (Little Italy in Cleveland, Ohio) and met in pre-school at the ageof 3. Ever since we were in 1 st -2 nd grade we did everything together, likesisters. I was closer with A…. than my own sister, for much of my early life. Wewere best friends (some-much of our lives) since the time we were little. I’m 40years old now.Our families have a long history together, since my father grew up in the sameneighborhood. We are like family].M: Is there something you want to ask this friend?P: (Pause) Were you jealous of me growing up?[Physically: My body felt tense and shoulders raised to my ears- when I said thework jealous. I think, I felt embarrassed to say the word] [Post Séance Discussion: At the end of 5 th -6 th grade I began loosing weight.I had a more stocky/ solid build until I started watching what I was eating andincreased my physical and/or athletic activity. I also started becoming moreinterested in boys around the same time which I believe, also added to my desireto loose weight. A… was also on the chunky side; and as we got older, her weightkept increasing. She is now obese].M: Yes. Ask other questions.P: Is that why you did things to hurt me?M: Yes. Ask another question. Don’t wait. Ask.P: Did you do those things intentionally?M: No…P: [Feeling: So happy to hear that] [Post Séance Discussion: I explained to Max that growing up in my neighborhoodwe had a group of about 4-5 girl-friends that were very close.Even our mothers and families were close. Inevitably when someone from my groupof friends got upset, with someone in the group, there was often a person leftout.I recall one time, in grade school, when I was very hurt about being left outspecifically by A…...As we got older, I was always being left out/ not told or not invited on trips,to concerts, given information (that pertained to my family…etc…) for a lot ofmy relationship with her. In doing this exercise and writing down the events ofthe séance a lot of stuff around this area came up. So, I felt I should expandon it further and share. Our friendship felt like a relationship of convenience.A….. loves to say “We’ve been best friends since we’ve been 3”; but often, heractions don’t show that on a normal, everyday basis- or at least as I expectthey should be. That is probably where the conflict lies (My Expectations orwhat I would do or how I would treat her/ others…] M: Ask another question. Don’t stopP: (Pause) Did you think my dad was your dad?(Said what came to mind; and thought it was a silly question to ask after itcame out]M: No [Post Séance Discussion: M: (after we spoke about the history with my friend A……)Incredible. You tapped into her double. That’s incredible.P: (Smiling. Thinking: Ok good, now what does that mean?]M: There is someone from your family (past) who you have (or your family has)severed relations with and she feels guilty. She would like to repair (fix) therelations (or see/ speak with you). Would you like to do this?P: YES.M: You know this person?P: Yes. Well actually, there are two people.M: OK. Don’t volunteer any information.P: (Think I was silent- ?)M: This one will take more time to clear…M: I’m getting tired. It’s time now for the Master to leave.M: Now put your hands over your head, palms face each other.P: OKMAX: Put your fingers like this, look at me.P: [I looked at Max but his head was surrounded, with what appeared to be like awhite fuzzy dot. It lasted only for a few seconds. Then, soon enough, it clearedand I could see Max clearly with his hands over his face explaining the positionof my fingers)M: Put your fingers like this. And bring your hands down to your chest, thumbs…do this. And repeat after me… (…. Closing Incantation…) Max asked me to stand up and sit on the couch. He proceeded into the kitchen,turned on the light and got a container from the cupboard.Then, he walk over to the area where the séance took place and spilled out somesalt, from the container, onto the carpet where I was laying during the session.He started with the area where head was placed. And again, he delicately droppedanother pinch of salt, shook his head and said, “weird!” He continued to thebottom of the carpet, place another pinch of salt where my feet had been. Andblew out the candle. Post Séance Discussion Points:• Immediately after the session I spoke with Max for about 45 minutes regardingthe séance and what I was able to remember.• Max was surprised (or acted surprised) by the length of time I re-called theevents of the séance. He explained that if the length of time was only 10minutes for the séance then how can I speak about it for 45 minutes?He continued to explain that our discussion was 4 x more than time as we knowit- in this dimension. He said that during the séance time stops/ doesn’t exist/stands still.(Max said something to this affect).• Later I asked Max:P: Is it normal for a difference in the length of time for the discussion vs theactual length of time of the séance occurred?M: Yes.P: Max, does the time of the discussion (which as Max described 4x) vs thelength of the actual séance show (or give and idea about) my spiritual power?M: Yes. If that is developed, then that means what you can produce can be 500times the rate of time in per/ hour (or average speed). Observation:I felt a lot of emotions before I arrived at Max’s for the séance, because of mydiscussion with Master X..P…., from the Meditation Center. I told her, I was notgoing to do the training in December and not going to the Interview on Fridaymorning- something I had been preparing for a long time; even though I havealways felt pulled.• I cried that evening when I returned home from the séance, like both a weightwas lifted off me and yet I had a sadness at the same time. It was as if I wasleaving part of my family behind from the yoga center. Some of the tears couldhave also been related to the release of knots I had been carrying for manyyears? P: I feel as if I wanted to cry. I asked if that was normal? (That feeling stillwas with me until the entire next day on Friday. I cried several times onFriday).M: It is normal. Post Discussion & Experience(s): • Max said, I will learn to do this (séance) to help others and then I wouldteach others to do this too.DINA: (Feeling: Excited and blessed to think I was going to learn:1) From Max, and,2) Be able to share this ancient knowledge and TRUTH to help people.I was (AM) VERY excited.• Max gave me an assignment to write everything down, VERBATIM, every detail,from the entire evening. He will use this to analyze the session- even includethe points from the Post Session. This will become my bible.• Max was pleased with the séance. He said it was a good first séance. (I washappy to hear that). Questions:1) The next day, after the session, I felt a pressure (not painful) on the rightside of my head, inside my head, about 2 inches behind my scalp. Wondering, ifthis is related to our session in any way?2) When I returned home I got on the phone briefly and eventually began doing myassignment, as instructed by Max.I did my best to re-call the experience on as many levels as I could. However,as was completing the journal on Saturday- just 2 days later, I feel as if Imissed so much of the material. I feel as if there was an entire section thatwas discussed before the Master left and it was gone?I can’t remember any other topics or points, in this moment, that I have notalready written about; and yet it still feels like a gap or a space between themoment of the last discussion and him leaving. Is that a normal feeling oroccurrence when recalling experience(s) within the absence of time (space)?3) How long will each session be going forward? And, as I get more comfortableand use to doing the sessions will that dictate the length of material coveredin the sessions? Notes:• I do not remember exactly when Max announced that a spirit came into the room.However, I still noted it in the journal to the best of my ability.• I keep feeling as if I missed a lot of nuances from the time the sessionoccurred, on Thursday evening, until I’m completing the journal tonight-Saturday evening.• While writing out the notes, it was as if the discussion was shorter then Iremembered it. It felt as if I had sooo much to say, when we were talking aboutit after the Séance. However, now that it’s written, it seems as if there was solittle said? The length in time seems so off; especially when putting theexperience down on paper.• When I woke up the next morning I felt as if I had gone through months worthof things overnight. I felt as if I had learned a host of lessons. For instance,by choosing Not To Go to the Interview was so clearing.I realized that just making a decision, whatever the outcome or result, allowsyou to move forward because you are not wasting time and lost in the uncertaintyof trying to make a decision. So, I felt like I matured in that way. 24 hour after the session: what happened?1. When I woke up the next morning I felt as if I had gone through two yearsworth of learning and maturation overnight. I felt as if I had learned a host oflessons beyond what I could have ever imagined. I felt so much lighter. Itseemed as if something was lifted off my shoulders- like a heaviness or weight.I was clearer and moved forward mentally leaps and bounds. Then it dawned on me,the reason was simple.All I had to do was to make a decision. Once I committed myself to my decision,in this case not to go on the interview, after months (even several years) ofpreparation, I made space inside myself, and in my mind, allowing me to moveforward in my own life. Because I was not preoccupied with the thought , I haveto make a decision, constantly looming over my head, like I had been doing formonths. Instead, I cut to the chase and stopped wasting energy, time and mindspace going back and forth with the question in my mind, and simply choose.As I was typing out this experience, I thought how amazing this awareness couldbe if it was applied to my life purpose. When we choose, when we make space inour minds and free ourselves from thoughts how opportunity there is to fullystep into ourselves and our lives and our purpose(s). 2. The same morning, after my session, it appeared to me, I was or felt morehumble. Even though my decision not to go on the interview, to be accepted intomore advanced training, was very difficult; and I cried the entire night andnext day. I realized my decision left me feeling calmer and stiller inside. Manyof these individuals, some of which I had prepared for almost two years for thistraining, and yet it had all changed for me. How was I going to explain this tothem, I thought, knowing I may face ridicule or judgment? Then it hit me, Ididn’t have to say or do anything except recognize that this was a huge lessonfor me as they were moving forward (in their eyes by doing the interview) and Iwas also moving forward by choosing not to do the interview.

Is there a Fik’r vibrational chart for these emotions? And whichone of these emotions produces the most vibrations?Answer:Look at the chart of Fik’r development below.R[Image00175.gif] elations and relationships produce the most intensevibrations. Question from Julia Bernardino:Does the Mouraba lesson eliminate stress and financial worries?Answer:Yes. See illustrations below. And here is a brief commentary on theillustrations of Mouraba Technique-Graph. [Image00176.gif] Mouraba Illustration #5 (Above) represents the 3 vibrational spheres ordimensions we live in, and/or we go through during our life in the 3 rddimension (Earth). Nobody will escape the effects of each dimension, physically,mentally and spiritually.Some are trapped in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions, others are capable of freeingthemselves at a certain level. If you feel trapped because you are poor,financially insecure, unimportant, unlucky, or constantly threatened (Could beanything), you will never be able to progress on any level. And your mind willdeteriorate. Worries of any kind are unhealthy.The next illustration (Chart) gives additional explanation. [Image00177.gif] The chart above is called “Simplified Chart of the 3 Spheres.” It is alsocalled, the Mouraba Squares Chart.It represents three spheres or levels of existences, human beings live in orpass through, during their life on Earth, and which are: > • 1-The physical-emotional sphere> • It belongs to the world of feelings and emotions> • 2-The mental-intellectual sphere> • It belongs to the mind (Intellect)> • 3-The spiritual-metaphysical sphere> • It belongs to the realm/level of spirit, encompassing spirituality, ethics,> morality, social codes, enlightenment, and so on Although, these 3 spheres have their separate vibrational worlds, they remainedclosely conditioned by the mental sphere. If we can deal with the mental zone(Mind), we will be able to solve lots of our problems.The power of your mind is enormous.If you use it wisely and pragmatically, you will be able to bring health andstability to your emotions; your mental power can even allow you to controlphysical pain, and eliminate stress and worries.The Enlightened Masters recommend that you transpose your stress and worries tothe zone of the mind. Let your mind worry about that, and keep the zone of youremotions safe and healthy.The Anunnaki Ulema have developed several techniques to deal with stress andfinancial worries.One of their techniques is demonstrated in Mouraba Illustration #6, on thefollowing page. For instance, they recommend that we send our worries, stress,fear and anxiety to the zone of the mind, one at the time.Here is a brief description of how it works:> • You send (Transfer) your worries and concern to the mental zone (Sphere of> the mind), because you should deal with your problems at an> intellectual-mental level.> • As long as your emotions, feelings and worries are trapped in the emotional> zone, you will not be able to assess and analyze the situation, rationally and> logically.> • You should not be emotional when you evaluate situations. It is wonderful to> have a great heart filled with warm feelings and goodness, but you should not> think with your heart. Leave your Heart Chakra alone when you go through> crises.> • Create an area for your concern in the mental zone. Let your mind work on> it.> • In the emotions sphere, open a register as seen in the Mouraba Illustration> #6.> • Write down the nature of your concern.> • Your mind has already started working on your concern. Soon, your mind will> send you a message. [Image00178.gif] > • The message sent to you by your Fik’r-Mind contains analyses of your> vibrations and energy.> • Write down the color of your vibrations.> • Write down the time (Day, hours) of your concern, meaning the period of your> concern; when you feel worried, anxious, afraid, etc.> • Below, register the time when you have received a mental message.> • Tell yourself you are going to revisit the “Concern Square” in your mental> zone.> • Apply the technique of the “Removal of the Knots”, I have given you in the> book “Activation of the Conduit and the Supersymetric Mind”, pages 138-150.> • Your mind has already removed the “Knots”, meaning successfully dealt with> your concern (s).> • See the illustration of the technique on page 130.> • Go now to the Illustration of the final result. This is how your emotional> field will look; clean, free from all worries and concerns, because your mind> has emptied the register, where you have written your worries. *** *** *** Illustration of the Final Result [Image00179.gif] *** *** *** [Image00180.gif] Questions from Ephrem Nehme:Does one’s vibration produce deadly physical strength as claimed by martialartists?

Iwould have had some questions far more interesting than your host butunfortunately the show ended without having that opportunity! I already know about the energy of people places and things that effect useveryday but I did not know about the geographical locations and how they aremapped out across the world other than the positive energy vortexes that drawpeople for their spiritual endeavors. Example: Sodona, AZ One of my questions would have been how you know the locations and how were theydiscovered??? I took some Astroprojection classes and learned how to utilize my vibrationalforce within me to protect oneself when in certain areas such as a train orplaces where there are many people or if one leaves the body to travel to higherlevels of learning or time travel.I have to say what I pick up from you when I listen to you talk on an intuitivelevel is that you function so much on an intellectual level that your heartchakra needs to be more engaged.Balance is what we seek to achieve. Just my observation! Best Always, DarleneAnswer:The locations are known to the Anunnaki Ulema and the Enlightened Masters. I amjust a passing shadow on the roads of life. My knowledge and learning are verylimited. What I have written and said about those locations, was revealed to meby the honorable and loving masters who took me under their wings. And how didthey know?I don’t know what Master Govinda, or the Buddha would have replied to aninquirer who asked this question: “How did you get enlightened?” or “How do youknow what you know?”Darlene, I would not dare to ask the Masters, what you have asked me. I wouldrather sit at the shadow of their feet, and enjoy my blessing for being there.An intellectual-mystic Ulema is safer to be around…for emotions could produceillusion and suffering, while a warm and honest intellect will guide you like ashining light on a dark night…on the road of your life… I am not that light,Darlene, just a shadow.Question: Is it true some places or neighborhoods bring bad luck?Answer:Absolutely.In many instances, luck (Bad or good) depends on where you live. Is it anapartment or a single house?Is it in the city or suburbia?Is it on the beach or in the mountains?Each part of earth has its own vibes.Some vibes are positive, and some are negative.The vibes of areas outside the city are usually healthier than the vibesemanated from spots and places in congested cities. And this does affect yourhealth, psyche, and luck. *** *** ***Question: What is the percentage of coincidence in reading the Bakht? I mean isit possible that something will pop up like a pure coincidence or by error? Answer:Everything is possible.This is why you should neither interpret the reading nor take it for granted. Inother words, you should observe all the rules of the reading, and if necessaryrepeat twice the same reading. If you keep on receiving mixed messages or if youthink what you have just read is a pure coincidence, then close up the Bakht andtry it again after 24 hours. *** *** *** [Image00184.jpg] Bad luck, superstitions and curses.Question from Rima Khan: Walking under a ladder could bring bad luck, accordingto many. Do you believe it is true? Answer:It is superstition. It has no effect on your luck. *** *** *** Employees’ bad vibes. Questions from Roy Bennedict: In volume two, page 83, you wrote “ In the UnitedStates, negative and bitter people are more likely to emit negative energy thatcan deeply affect you mentally and physically on Monday and on Tuesday than onany other days of the week. Employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs andwho dislike their boss diffuse intense bad vibes during the early and late hoursof the day of their shifts. These vibes become more intense upon returning home,especially during the first 40 minutes.” Are these bad and negative vibescreated by the angry boss or the unhappy employees? Why employees’ vibes becomemore intense when they come home?And what are the symptoms? Can we sense these symptoms? Answer:The bad vibes are created by both the bullying-boss (Employer) and theemployees.Monday is the day when employees’ bad vibrations and negative energy intensify.The very first 40 minutes-period refers to the time period when the bad vibesexteriorize outside the zone of the workplace. This does not mean thatemployees’ bad vibes are not noticeable from 9 to 5.It simply means that when they return home, their state of mind creates anetheric-physical zone surrounding their bodies that could be sensed by manypeople. Some of the symptoms are:a-Employees are easily irritated when you talk them during the 40 minutestime-period.b-Fatigue becomes apparent, and in some instances, they start to feel musculardiscomfort around the neck, the back, and the feet.c-My advice to you is to give them time to relax, and to get out of the layersof negative residues they have stored in their Khateyn Tarika at the workplace.Soon after, their moods will change, and everything will be OK. Ana’kh Bakht and good fortune Question from Salim Ghorbal: Is Bakht good luck or bad luck? Is the magic bookon spirits called Sham Al Maaref Koubra, a practical guide to communicate withspirits and stop the curses of bad people? Answer:Bakht is an Ana’kh word which means many things, such as fortune,fortune-telling, reading the future, luck (Bad or good), foreseeing particularsegments from future events, and reading what was written in the book of yourlife, at the time you were born, and even before you existed on Earth.Thousands of years later, Arab and Pre-Islamic scholars began to use the Anakhword Bakht in their Arabic language. Today, you will find the word Bakht inwritten and spoken Arabic.The modern Egyptians use the word Bakht quite frequently. But the meaning haschanged a little bit, because Bakht in Arabic means “Haz”, and “Haz” means luck.Some fortune-tellers in Egypt and the Near East interpret “Haz” as the future.Thus “Reading the Bakht” in Arabic today means: Foretelling your future andluck.The earliest manuscript on Bakht appeared in Phoenicia, circa 7,500 B.C., and itwas written in Ana’kh. A later version in Anakh-Pro-Ugaritic appeared threethousand years later. A third version written in the early Phoenician-Byblosscript appeared in Byblos and Tyre.There are also two versions in Akkadian and Old Babylonian language, which areassumed lost.Around 65 A.D., a new version in Arabic appeared in the Arabian Peninsula, andPersia, and it was called “Firasa”.Around 685 A.D., a revised edition appeared in Damascus, Syria. It was saidthat, from this Syrian edition, derived the hand-written manuscript “Ilmu AlDonia” (Science or Knowledge of the Universe). This manuscript included chapterson Arwah (Spirits and non-human entities), Djins, and Afrit.Around 1365 A.D., a book titled “Shams Al Maaref Al Koubra” appeared in Cairoand Damascus, based upon two books “Al Bakht: Dirasat Al Moustakbal”, and “IlmuAl Donia”.Sham Al Maaref Koubra, is a fascinating book. The early Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiinused it very effectively.To Westerners, the book is worthless.Anunnaki, bad luck, fate and negative vibrations. Question from Jamil Soudki : Have the Anunnaki already decided on our luck? Ifso, then vibrations have nothing to do with our bad luck or good luck? If not,is there a direct link from luck to what you have said about the innerbio-rhthym created by Anunnaki to influence our lives and fate? Answer:Thousands of years ago, before history was recorded, the Anunnaki created thefirst Man to meet their needs. They created us as a work-force to take care ofthe fields, cultivate the land, and bring them food; this is according to theAkkadian/Sumerian clay tablets. It is very clear.At that time, when the Anunnaki gods and goddesses (Aruru, Mummu, Ea, Ninna,etc.) created the first prototypes of the quasi-human races, Man did not haveall the mental faculties we have today. Thus, no Bakht was written for us.We had no future. And the purpose of our life on Earth was dictated by theAnunnaki. It was not a bright future, and it was limited and fashioned by theintentions of the Anunnaki. Later on, 13 new faculties were added to the brainof the early Man.And everything in the brain was wired and functioned according to a cellularrhythm. We cannot change this rhythm. But we can improve on it, and ameliorateits functioning, by acquiring new knowledge, developing a stronger memory,reading, writing, listening to intelligent and well-informed people, getting ridof bad habits, and elevating our being to a higher mental/spiritual level,through introspection, meditation, and refraining from hurting others. By doingso, we can free ourselves and reach a higher dimension of knowledge andawareness.Some people are born normal, others are born with some mental deficiency, whilea few were created as geniuses, like Bach, Mozart, etc., people who astonishedus with extraordinary creativity, and unmatched talents. These talents andmental gifts were already “placed” into their Conduit. Otherwise, how can weexplain the astonishing musical compositions of Mozart and other great composersat the age of 4?Yes, we can alter the inner bio-rhthym, the Anunnaki installed in us, but wecannot change it completely. And by altering the rhythm, we can alter ourfuture. This can be detected by reading the Bakht.First thing to do is to activate the Conduit. As far as luck (Good and bad) isconcerned, the noble in spirit (Mind, or “Soul” if you want) will be given theopportunities and means to learn how to positively reshape future events inhis/her life. Unfortunately, there are too many good people in the world who areconstantly suffering. And we wonder where is the logic?What is the reason for their suffering? Is it true that good people alwaysfinish last?Sadly enough, it happens all the time.We see hard-working nurses (Who save lives) struggling to make a living. We seedevoted school teachers unable to pay their bills.We see bloody bastards gettingricher and richer, while honorable, loving and caring people are being kickedout of their homes!!Where is the justice?The truth I tell you, is that there is no justice on Earth, despite all the goodintentions of so many of us, and despite so many good court decisions, anddecent laws to maintain law and order.The Ulema taught us that a good behavior, a high level of morality, anunconditional love, forgiveness and generosity do not guarantee success in life,or secure a good luck.Ulema Badri said verbatim: “Your character and good manners are the only thingsyou should keep even when you have lost everything in life.So, start developing your brain, activate your Conduit, talk to yourinner-self…and there, you will find the salvation…, you will find a way tochange your bad luck into good luck.If your Mind is in harmony with your “Jaba”, then, and only then, can you changeyour inner bio- rhythm, and influence your DNA’s metamorphosis.” And remember,your DNA is a vital part of your future. You can decipher its sequence byreading your Bakht. *** *** *** The 3 Primordial Tarot Cards for Good Luck Question from Antoine Farah : You wrote in your book on Tarot and good luck thatif we use three special cards from the Anunnaki Ulema Tarot deck, we could stopthe effects of the evil eye and stop bad vibrations. Where can I find thesethree cards? Do you have a technique I can use to make these cards work for me?By the way, what do we call these three magic cards? Answer:I. Names of the three primordial Tarot cards:Card 1 is called Jisru, Jisri, meaning a bridge.Card 2 is called: Rahma, Rama, meaning mercy, assistance.Card 3 is called Akafa, meaning to halt or eliminate a mishap. II. Purpose of each card:Each card serves a different purpose. And its use depends on your need andparticular situation.For example, if something (A plan, a wish) is not coming your way, and/or seemsto be blocked for some unknown reasons, you must use Card 3 (Akafa). If you feelthat you are threatened or warned about an awful event to happen to you, youmust use Card 2 (Rahma, Rama). If you feel that a competition is too strong toovercome, and/or your chances to get this or that are minimal, use Card 1(Jisru, Jisri). III. How to use the cards. Preparation:> • a -First of all, you must cut each card and laminate it.> • b -Once laminated, keep the three cards wrapped into a piece of clothe> (Silk) and place the cards under your pillow for 24 hours.> • c -Take the three cards from under your pillow and hold them in the palm of> your right hand for at least one minute.> • d -While holding on the cards, do NOT think about anything negative or> fearful.> • e -Do not let your own bad vibes penetrate the cards. Do not let your fear> contaminate the cards.> IV. How to use the cards. Application:> • 1-Shuffle the cards 7 times.> • 2-Do not follow any shuffling order.> • 3-Pile the 3 cards on the lower side of the Tarot table.> • 4-Start reading your Bakht from the beginning.> • 5-As soon as you get a bad reading, stop the reading right away.> • 6-Open up the first piled card (From the 3 Primordial Cards) placed on the> lower side of the Tarot table.> • 7-Remove the bad card from the square. The square is where you have placed> the bad card.> • 8-Replace the bad card with the first piled card from the three primordial> card.> • 9-Now, start reading your Bakht from the second square on your Tarot Table.> You remember, there are four squares on your Tarot Table.> • 10-This new placement should change the reading.> • 11-If the second square continues to have a bad card, take it out of the> square, and replace it with the second piled card from the three primordial> cards.> • 12-If the third square continues to have a bad card, take it out of the> square, and replace it with the third piled card from the three primordial> cards.> • 13-Now, you have 3 good cards placed in 3 squares.

Each one of us has a calendar of lucky days and unlucky days, lucky hoursand unlucky hours. And you can find out by establishing the Calendar Grid. *** *** *** “Kama”, Center of EnergyQuestion from Giorgio Anatoli: Is Kama, one of the energies spots in our body?Answer:No. Kama was called “an etheric center of energy”, by Ulema Oppenheimer. Alsoreferred to as the “Manifestation Square”, meaning a zone where different formsof appearances, including beings and higher entities manifest themselves formultiple reasons. The Manifestation Square is indeed a physical area on Earth.Some Ulema suggested that this Square serves as a platform for the Ba’ab.According to Ulema Stanbouli, the Earth is full of these Squares. However, theyare not permanent, meaning they appear on Earth, each time a cosmic molecule or“Buble” collides with another Bubble. This happens cosmically.The Manifestation Squares materialize on Earth, when two distinct yet very closedimension membranes “bump” into each other. Ulema Stanbouli added, “The wholeuniverse was created in this way.” From Kama, derived the Hebrew word Kamea,which means a magic square. In esoterica and occult studies, Kama or Kamea are aplace, or a zone used by Kabalists and occultists to communicate with non-humanentities in order to accomplish magical acts. *** *** *** Reading and visiting the future through vibration. Question from Nura:If we enter the world of vibration, the mental world, can we read the future?And, can we change it? Also, is there a technique to do so? Is it like readingthe oracle? If we enter the realm of the future, can we change it?Answer:Yes, you can enter the realm of the future and see what is going to happen toyou in the future. But, you can’t change the future. However, the beauty ofgoing into the future is using a technique to change the outcome of an event (inthe future). For example, once you are in the sphere of the future you might seeyourself hit by a car in the year 2014. And unfortunately, you will see yourselfdead- the car killed you.Now, you can’t prevent the accident because it was already written. However, youcan change the outcome of the accident, meaning instead of being killed by thecar, you can do something to get only injured instead.So, you are not interfering with the synchronized rule of the universe, themacro wheel. But, you are spinning inside the sphere of the future, within themacro wheel and therefore, you are able to change one of the rotations insteadof the whole movement, since each incident has it’s own rotation of the wheel onthe landscape of the universe.Going in the future is like going in the past. You can’t change the event in thefuture. You can’t change the event in the past. You can’t go in the past, 60 or70 years in the past, like the Holocaust and stop the massacre of the Jews. Butyou can attenuate the catastrophic results by giving warning of others.This is the kind of information and knowledge the Ulema share with theirstudents. But to do this you have to find the grid of time-space; even so, thisis still not enough because you still have to find yourself in the grid. Simplyput, you have to talk to the grid. Talking to the grid means, you have to putinside the grid your name, like entering you name on your computer to enter it,it’s like a password.Now this password is your name; but not the name you have, because the one youhave is the name your parents gave you- in memory of your ancestors, Robert IV…in the realm of vibration these things don’t exist because they are notterrestrials.The original name that belongs to the astral body, which is the originalblueprint of yourself. Call it the serial number; the code. Now we have twonames; one that belongs to your physical body and one that belongs to yourastral body.Once you find your etheric name, you put it inside the grid and this is how youwill be able to transcend physical frontiers and visit various dimensions.So once you commit yourself to this awakening you become part of the widerpicture of the universe. Other masters call this the state of one-ness. All thiscan be reached through vibration. Question from Nura: So the state of oneness is really about awakening to theidea, the power of intention, like committing yourself, to the belief that weare all connected- not opening the heart chakra but the belief…so it’s not aphysical process or physical access?Answer:It is both physical and mental. Scientifically it is possible. According toquantum physics if you can make your molecules thinner then the molecules of theside of a wall, for example, you can penetrate the wall. This is proven byscience.This is how the Ulema defrayment their molecules and how they materialize anddematerialize, known to the general public as deportation. When you master thiscapability you will be able to enter multiple and adjacent dimensions. On amental level, you don’t need substance de-fragmentation.All you need to do is set your mind free, on the multiple layers of vibrations.And those vibrations, because they are not physical, can go through solidsubstances such as wall, barricades, libraries… (For more information on thisand similar techniques, you can refer to my other books). The important thing isnot only to understand the study of vibrations and energy as a way to helpprotect yourself from others bad vibes; but also, and more importantly, likebeing on a magic carpet, to help you travel to other dimensions, and set yourmind free by sending them forward on other layers of dimensions. *** *** ***Question from Leila R:I was told the human body has 7 Chakras.

Question: What is the outlook for mankind after the year 2022? You haveexplained this in some detail in your books but will we live in peace or doeshumankind still pose a threat to one another if challenges and greed areproposed like they always have been? Answer: [Image00192.gif]NASA’s ring of hydrogen particles. *** *** *** NASA has discovered a ring of hydrogen particles around our solar system–aprotective layer, which is now being called the Heliosphere. This was announcedby the Anunnaki-Ulema, centuries ago, and they called the ring “The CosmicPlasmic Belt.” The Heliosphere is generated by solar wind particles, which originate deepwithin the Sun. NASA launched the Interstellar Boundary Explorer Mission (IBEX)last year to get a better picture of the Heliosphere.It was always suspected that it existed, but NASA scientists thought it existedin a completely different form; instead of being a uniform stripe, there arebright spots, which indicate the “bubble” has varying intensity and density.Also, though NASA knows it protects the solar system from the radiation outsideof it, scientists still aren’t entirely sure why it is there or what it does. Asnoted by NASA. *** *** *** 2022 happenings are diverse, and could be easily misinterpreted by the public.Nothing physically will occur on Earth’s landscape, or in its atmosphere.A clash between a segment of non-terrestrials and humans is inevitable in thefuture. In the past, more than 3 incidents occurred in secret military bases, andproduced fatal consequences.The incidents were provoked by military men who according to Greys’ revelationshave insulted Grey scientists who had worked on two joint- programs with themilitary.The future clash will occur between the Anunnaki and the Greys, and humans willbe caught in the middle. The outlook of mankind will be seriously affected bydirect interference from the Anunnaki group called “Baalshamroot Ram”.This is the very group that surrounded the Solar System with the “Cosmic PlasmicBelt”; intense radiations/high velocity ranges of rays, as recently revealed byNASA. The human race will never be in peace with itself, and with its own kind. Thisis dictated by the “Naf-Siya”, the “Araya”, the DNA and the bio-psychologicalmakeup of human nature, originally created by the Anunnaki on two occasions:The first time some 450,000 years ago, and the second time (Final Phase), some10,000 years ago, which announced the dawn of civilizations on Earth. Greed is an indivisible segment and one of the characteristics of the fabric ofthe human psyche. Thus, greed will always be here, and will increase the levelof the contamination of mankind.However, the year 2022 will bring major changes to social systems, and thesechanges will have enormous influence on the public’s concept of religions.Christianity’s dogma could be altered. Islam will not be affected by thesechanges. Buddhism, and Hinduism will not affected either, simply because Buddhism isfounded on the concept of “Transmission of mind,” and thus is not a religion perse.Ancient Hinduism and Hindu manuscripts and inscriptions have already announcedand pre-announced the existence of celestial spacecrafts known as “Vimanas”created by the “Gods”, a super race from the multiple layers of the universe.Consequently, both will blend perfectly with the comprehension and definition ofa new social order to be established by the Anunnaki. In short, 2022 will bring paramount changes to:a-Religions;b-Social order. *** *** *** Another extraterrestrial threat other than the Gray's aliens Question by Matt Hoxtell, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Question: After the Anunnaki's job is finished here on earth throughdecontamination will we ever have to deal with another Extraterrestrial threatother than the Gray's aliens?Answer:The only threat humanity will face is the product of the Greys’ agenda. It isimportant to understand, that the Greys have lived on Earth for millions ofyears, long before the human races were created by the Igigi, Anunnaki andLyrans. We call the Greys “extraterrestrials”. This is not entirely correct, asthe Greys are the intraterrestrials of Earth, and humans their co-habitants. Wefear the Greys. And ironically, the Greys also fear us. They feel threatened byour nuclear arsenal and experiments, because these can annihilate Earth, wherethe Greys live. Earth is also the habitat of the Greys. Earth is where their communities and families live. Greys will do anything andeverything to prevent humans from destroying Earth. Earth will be only destroyedby acts of nuclear war. The Greys have adapted very well to the intra-landscapeof Earth; meaning Inner-Earth. And water on Earth is essential for theirsurvival and for “energizing” their crafts. Unfortunately, constant interactionswith the Greys will deteriorate the genes of the human race.The first phase of such deterioration is contamination.The Anunnaki are fully aware of this contamination. Simply put, in order toeliminate the contamination of human and human DNA, the Anunnaki must get rid ofthe Greys.And the decontamination process will result in a major confrontation with theGreys. Some influential governments have already received a sort of “briefing”on the subject.Some high officials took the threat very seriously, whilst many others did not.Their arrogance and ignorance will have lethal consequences, which humanity willsuffer from.No, there are no additional threats from other extraterrestrial races, simplybecause they are not interested in us. They are not interested, because we havenothing meaningful or important to offer them. Humans live on a linear scale.This is how and why we understand the universe in terms of time anddistance/space. And this limits us, and prevents us from becoming members of the“Cosmic Federation.”Only two races in the known universe can live on Earth: The Anunnaki and theGreys. In the past three extraterrestrial races lived here on Earth, forsometime among us.They were:> • a -The Anunnaki;> • b -The Lyrans;> • c -The Greys. Their organisms and body structure could sustain our atmosphere and itsconditions. Other extraterrestrials would not be able to live on Earth, ashumans are not able to live on other known stars and planets because of theiratmospheric conditions. Other alien races will self-destruct if they try to liveon Earth.Consequently, they have no interest whatsoever in invading or dominating Earth.In other words, the only threat, the only real threat, will come from the Greys.But for the time being, we are safe, because the Greys still need us. Despitetheir highly advanced technology and science, the Greys did not yet find theperfect and final formula for saving themselves, genetically.For some incomprehensible and possibly silly reasons, the survival of the Greysdepends on two things:> • a -The survival of humans;> • b -The safety of planet Earth. *** *** *** Aliens competing with the Anunnaki to rule our planet? Question by Matt Hoxtell, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Question: Are there any other alien races in this galaxy or another that couldcompete with the superstar status of the Anunnaki and rule our planet?Answer:On the market nowadays, we find several so-called encyclopedias and field-guideson extraterrestrial races. The Internet is infested with silly and childishwebsites posting ridiculous literature on extraterrestrial races, description oftheir physiognomy, heights, weights, eyes, skin, etc. This is nonsense parexcellence. How did they know about these extraterrestrial races?What are their sources, data, and authoritative references? They arenon-existent. Their articles are the product of an erroneous imagination andimmature fantasy.Unless you break the frontiers of time and space, and land on their planets andstars, you will never be able to learn about their species, physiognomy andtheir biological structure on any level. As long as modern ufology embraces suchphantasmagoric assumptions and fake narratives, ufology will never be acceptedacademically, or gain the respect and trust of erudite milieus and scientists.However, and according to some statements and “leaks”, we have learned about theexistence of six different extraterrestrial races who have contacted the UnitedStates military.This was mentioned in the “Krill File”.But again, this so-called file was announced to the ufology community by Mr.Moore, who has been discredited by eminent ufologists. And once again, I ask youto define what we understand by “Eminent ufologists”? How eminence is defined,and on what basis or foundation, such eminence is based upon and structured?To tell you the truth, nobody knows, except the Anunnaki-Ulema. Unless you arefamiliar with Ana’kh, and have read the archaic manuscripts of theAnunnaki-Ulema, and some of the Phoenician cosmogeny tablets, and unless you arefamiliar with the Akkadian and proto-Mesopotamian language(s), you will never beable –for sure– to categorize the galactic races.All we have is mythology and colorful folklore. And beginning in the early1950’s, authors began to put their spin on everything extraterrestrial or alien.Call it science fiction, or perhaps mytho-inspirational essay, but not anauthoritative study of galactic civilizations.As of today, we are aware of the existence of two races:a-The Greys;b-The Anunnaki.The Greys became known to us through articles by all sorts of ufologists,contactees (usually phony/fake), abductees, charlatan channelers, statements byso-called military men who worked in secret military bases, “insiders” andself-serving authors.The truth I tell you, is that the Greys do exist, but they are not, who, whatand how they are generally described to be, by many ufologists and those whoclaim to have had any sort of contact or rapport with them. In some cases,accounts of encounters were correct, but in general, 95% of accounts and reportsbetray the truth, simply because the human mind is unable to understand whatflashes before our eyes.And this apparent in the way contactees/abductees (followed by a fleet ofufologists) describe the Greys. For instance, how many times have you heard fromabductees and ufologists alike, that the Greys or extraterrestrials have verybig eyes in proportion to the size of their heads, and the eyes were describedas large eyes slanted upward and outward, or big dark eyes that were olive oralmond-shaped?Many times, I’m sure. To tell you the truth, extraterrestrials’ eyes are as bigor as small as human eyes. And their sockets are almost similar to ours, butwith three major differences. One of them is the retina. Aliens do not haveretina in their eyes, simply because they do not need one.Abductees were not able to realize that aliens or extraterrestrials eyes were“masked.”By masked I mean their eyes were covered by a dark lens or more exactly ascreen, called “Bou-Ka’h” in the Ana’kh, the Anunnaki language. The large blackeyes were simply a dark screen applied to the eyes of the extraterrestrials.Consider this screen as eyeglasses for now (But in actuality these glassesprovided the alien with information, much like glasses with mini TV/info screenson them being made and used by the military today).This common error is clearly shared by ufology authors, ufologists, andresearchers alike. This serious misconception and erroneous description arestrong evidence that we have no clear vision or understanding of the physiognomyof extraterrestrials.If this is true, then we are not in a position to categorize and adequatelyclassify aliens, extraterrestrials, and Greys.Thus, recognizing and/or defining other extraterrestrial species is purespeculation. In conclusion, we should concentrate exclusively on two known non-human races;the Anunnaki and the Greys.Such concentration will enable us to conclude that:> • 1-There are no other extraterrestrials on the scene;> • 2-The Greys are not in any position to compete with the Anunnaki. And since we have logically eliminated the possible interference from otheralien races/non-humans that exist in our galaxy/other galaxies answering thequestion: “Are there any other alien races in this galaxy or another that couldcompete with the superstar status of the Anunnaki and rule our planet?” becomesan easy task.And the answer is: The Greys cannot rule our planet, nor can they challenge thesuper status of the Anunnaki for obvious reasons.One of these reasons is the fact that the Anunnaki are far more advanced thanthe Greys. *** *** *** Would the Anunnaki come to aid the planet if another threat happens? Questions by Matt Hoxtell, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Question: You have stated that the Anunnaki feel responsible for hybridcontamination between humans and the Gray's, would the Anunnaki ever come to theaid of the planet aif this threat would happen again?Answer:Yes and yes.This was basically the topic Sinhar Ambar Anati (Victoria) discussed withrepresentatives from the United States government years ago.Please refer to the book: “Anunnaki Ultimatum”, co-authored by Ilil Arbel. Anatimade it clear to American scientists and to two generals, that the Greys’contamination will inevitably destroy the human race. *** *** *** Question: Has the planet ever come close to another threat as serious as theGray's and will it be a possibility?Answer:Yes, millions of years ago, when a huge celestial object was on a trajectory inthe direction of planet Earth.The Anunnaki deviated the object from its collision course with Earth . Andlater on, they decided to surround the Solar system with a protection shield,known as “The Cosmic Plasmic Belt”, which is called “Zinar” in Ana’kh, theAnunnaki language. This was also mentioned in the Book of Ramadosh “KetabRama-Dosh.” *** *** *** Are the Anunnaki going to take over Earth? Questions by Reverend Nancy Santos. Question : Is one of these Anunnaki Gods going to take over the earth after thepole shift? Answer:No! For two reasons:> • 1 -The pole is not going to shift. So don’t worry. This is based upon> mainstream science. However, it could shift as it did before, millions of> years ago. But scientists are not concerned. They are absolutely sure that no> shift will occur anytime soon.> • 2 - If the Anunnaki intend to take over Earth, they will not wait until the> pole shift. They can do it any time, at will. But they are not interested at> all.Read the section on the final warning.Dear Sandra, you have to remember that the Anunnaki are not territorial.Besides, planet Earth is meaningless to them. We, as human beings are notinteresting enough to the Anunnaki. Our natural resources are found on numerousplanets, readily accessible to the Anunnaki.There are 7 galaxies in the cosmos filled with natural resources available tothe Anunnaki, and these resources are not contaminated. We think that we are thecenter of the universe, because we are arrogant and pretentious. In fact, veryvery very few alien civilizations are aware of our existence. And they have nointerest whatsoever of paying a visit to us. However, and according to StephenWilliam Hawking , it is not a good idea to try to reach other civilizations inthe universe. He warned us. Now, this does not mean that other alien races arenot visiting our planet. Some have visited Earth several times, as part of theirgalactic excursions.They came and they left. Nevertheless, the intraterrestrial aliens are stillhere.Why?It is very simple: They lived here millions of years before we were created.This is why we call them the intraterrestrials. They are not humans, and theylive in isolated areas and aquatic habitats. These races are peaceful to acertain degree, as long as, the human race will not jeopardize the safety ofEarth.So in conclusion, the Anunnaki are not going to take over the Earth. But pleasedo remember, that we are expecting a global communication/contact/rapport withthem in 2022. *** *** *** Human race: The Anunnaki creation of a new human race after 2022 Question by Raoul Mondragon, Vera Cruz, Mexico. Question: I am very worried by what you have written on the subject of thereturn of the Anunnaki in 2022? Is it for real? Are they going to change the waywe look? Are they going to get rid of us and replace us with a new human race?What kind?Answer:What kind of a new human race are we talking about?A new genetic race?A bio-genetic race?A new race with new physical characteristics and different physiognomy?“None of the above,” said the Honorable Master Li.He added verbatim, word for word, and unedited: “The physical form of humanswill not change.Unless, the Anunnaki will take us back to the primordial Chimiti (Akkadian wordfor the genetic lab tubes, used by the Anunnaki to create an early form of humanbeings.)And this is very unlikely, even impossible. The changes will occur on differentlevels, and almost instantly.” *** *** *** Russian Underwater Bases Questions by Angelique Doudnikova Question: Is it true that a massive Russian underwater base exists one mile deepin the Marianas trench in the Pacific ocean? If so, whatactivities/research/experiments are going on there?Do the Chinese have one too?Answer:Yes, it is true. The Russians have a massive underwater base that was created in1969, to study an extraterrestrial underwater navigation system called “AquaticPlasma Corridors”.This corridor is undetectable by satellite, sonar or any other underwaterdetection system.Not all branches of the Russian Navy were aware of the creation/existence ofthis base.During one of their naval maneuvers just outside the perimeter of this Russianunderwater base, six frogmen from one of the Russian submarines encounteredthree alien frogmen in metallic suits underneath a massive metallic object.Both the Russian and alien frogmen were roughly at a depth of one hundred to onehundred and twenty feet. The alien frogmen were wearing what appeared underwaterto be metallic suits of indeterminable and interchanging colors that morphedfrom a silvery white to bluish to grey.One of the Russian frogmen stated that when he tried to approach these three, hewas blocked by what seemed to be an invisible underwater forcefield, created bythe alien frogmen as a protection sheild.The Russian frogman’s oxygen tanks started to fail and he quickly lostconsciousness and started sinking but was saved by one of his fellow divers.After being rescued, he described the alien frogmen as being 8ft to 11ft tall,as he saw them underwater. And none of them had any visible oxygentanks/breathing apparatus attached to them.In the secret debriefing that followed, the Russian diver who saved his fellowfrogman, said that when he too tried to approach this massive foreign submergedobject, he encountered what felt like a solid transparent wall surrounding theobject.He later described it as an oval glass box, surrounding this mysterioussubmerged object which also shielded it from contact with the ocean’s water.After the fall of the Berlin wall, and ensuing collapse of the Soviet Empire,rumors started circulating within the military and scientific community, thatthis bizarre event was in fact a joint Russian-extraterrestrial operationdesigned to explore the effects of the underwater plasma corridor on it’senvironment in the ocean, and on humans, as well as their psychological andpsychosomatic reaction to encountering the corridor and seeing the alien frogmenand the ship itself.Two decades later in Lake Baikal, other Russian navy frogmen encountered similar9ft “silver swimmers” who also had no visible breathing apparatus. While theseencounters are largely unknown to the general public, military scientists withtop clearance are well aware of them, and have worked on similar projects indifferent underwater bases, such as the one known to us as AUTEC, which islocated off Andros Island in the Bahamas.These massive underwater military bases, whether they be Russian, or American orChinese, look from the surface to be rectangular/traditional compoundstructures. However upon entering them underwater, they expand in all directions, and areextremely extensive. And all of them are joint human-alien operations.Starting from the second underwater level, compartments are divided into largeoperation rooms, separated by elaborate long corridors, curving at 90 degreesevery hundred feet or so, with doors that can drop down from the ceiling to sealoff segments in the event of radiation leakage, or any matter related tointernal security. One of the interesting characteristics of these doors in thecorridors is the circular porthole-like windows within what is a whitish metalof extraterrestrial origin.None of these metallic alloys are possible here due to earth’s gravity, and assuch have to be done in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle. Interestingly enough,this technology has been shared by American, Russian and Israeli militaryscientists.At one time British and French scientists complained of being left out of theloop, to which the Americans responded very candidly “We don’t trust Europeans –especially the French!” To which the French retorted that they would withholdall information garnered from the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn…An American three star general was quick to respond by saying “This is not thefirst time you Europeans have withheld information from us. Remember the Belgianincident?” (Aurora)The mode of transportation down to the underwater base and within the base isalso fascinating.From the surface, one enters a craft that looks like a silvery metallic spinningtop, approximately 8ft in diameter, that can comfortably accommodate fourpassengers, and corkscrews its way downwards centrifugally around a rod using aform of magnetic propulsion for what seems to be a only a few seconds down to anunknown depth. (With a cheeky smile, M. de Lafayette added that he did not thinkthe Chinese yet had this technology.)From the second underwater level on down, the “Spinning Mobile Satellite” (SMS)travels horizontally and reaches its final destination at an undisclosed levelof the base at which it again dives into water. It is at that level/destinationthat you will find the habitat and work center of the Grays.Only the highest level personnel with top clearance can go there. Not evenPresident Barack Obama or Vice-president Joe Biden, or any member ofCongress/Senate is allowed access to that level at these facilities.This clearance status was decided upon (jointly) by the NSA, the CIA, the UnitedStates Air Force, the DOD and NASA. Even the FBI has been excluded from thisexclusive little club.This is perfectly appropriate, since politicians come and go, whilst themilitary are sworn to secrecy, the average career of top military brass arethirty or more years, and they take their secrets with them to the grave.[Image00193.jpg] “The Body” Ventura, former WWF wrestler, and one time governorof Minnesota, who kept all the secrets sealed from the public while in office,yet is now spilling the beans on his own conspiracy show on television!! Worthmentioning here also, is the fact that Lafayette loves Ventura, but were heGeneral Jesse Ventura he would have kept his mouth shut. Jesse “The Body” Ventura. Do people have a right to know all these things, including the joint human-alienventures? And my answer is: Absolutely not! At the present time, so as not toshatter the fabric of our society and cause complete chaos and total anarchy,this information should be withheld and only gradually released to the public asset forth in the U.S.-extraterrestrial protocol, because humans have to bementally prepared, in order to meet the extraterrestrial.”Anunnaki Prevention of Use of Nuclear Weapons Question by Angelique Doudnikova. Question: Will the Anunnaki intervene to prevent possible aggressive use ofatomic/thermonuclear weapons against other nation(s) prior to, and/or duringtheir return in 2022? [Image00194.gif] Photo: Benazir Bhutto Answer:From yet undisclosed data, Maximillien de Lafayette said the most imminentthreat will come not from Iran, but from Pakistan , an as yet highly unlikelysurprise scenario. Benazir Bhutto knew of this, spoke about it behind closed doors, and wasassassinated soon after. __________ I found it very childish and ridiculous when American ufologists wrote onsubjects pertaining to extraterrestrials and nuclear issues since they areabsolute outsiders.Nowhere in their books have they ever written on the Anunnaki and their Ba’abs.Why are some of the Ba’abs so extremely important?They lead to the parallel dimensions of the Anunnaki, and the beginning of time,where the God-Particle/Higgs Boson can be found, which is the reason for thebuilding of CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC).Through the Miraya – a cosmic screen/monitor with a vast depot of data thatinforms the Anunnaki of past, present and future events occurring in non-linearform, and in different galaxies by which the Anunnaki can monitor the activitiesof humans on Earth, the Grays, Reptilians, Nordics, Lyrans, Dracos, Plaeidiansetc, and envoys from various other galactic civilizations wrongly identified andreferred to as “The Galactic Federation/Council” .There is no way for a medium/channeler/psychic to the stars sitting in his/herapartment in Wala Wala, or Biloxi, Mississippi or in the swamps of Louisiana,listening to Willie Nelson’s “On the Road Again” to access this Miraya andreveal the secrets of the Universe.The Anunnaki will definitely intervene if a nuclear explosion were seen on theMiraya screen to happen near a Ba’ab connected to their galaxy, close to themembrane of the Universe that could cause chaos and disequilibrium in theeleventh dimension of the Universe. This is all very possible, since the speechgiven by Adolf Hitler at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, can still be heard indifferent worlds, as can the Sermon that was given by Yeshuah (Jesus) on theMount of Olives. Both can be heard in the “Time-Space Depository”. A bank ofinformation, that Nikola Tesla accidentally tapped into.

Thetruth is: the galactic mind of the extraterrestrials functions differently.Consequently, the alien mode of operation becomes totally incomprehensible toour mind, and instead of focusing on how many military personnel they mightsend, we should focus on how many I.S.Ms they will operate at close proximity toEarth. This stands for “Intelligent Satellite Module”.Each module is approximately 8ft to 10ft in diameter, made of “fibro-metal”, analloy of elements not found on Earth, which is cone shaped on the top half andoval shaped on the bottom half. Worth mentioning here, the Gray aliens havecraft similar to the “I.S.M.” being smaller in diameter at 6ft to 8ft wide.These were witnessed by farmers in the mid-west several times, and reported oncable T.V.The purpose of the Gray’s I.S.Ms, was to scan particular areas in the UnitedStates for several military strategic reasons, such as creating an atmosphericshield network which could alter the fabric of weather and be used to controlclimatic/atmospheric conditions over a chosen area/country.This military ecological weapon system produces tsunamis, earthquakes,mysterious underground detonations, complete destruction of all types ofagriculture, forests and natural resources (crops, trees, orchards, and everykind of plant).Have we seen these kinds of catastrophic events recently in different parts ofthe world?Whilst the Gray I.S.Ms require a complicated operational structure, encompassinglarge numbers of military personnel, one Anunnaki can handle up to one thousandof their I.S.M. machines.They will be using the Shabka - a cosmic net, made up of anti-radar emissionsand rays that not even N.O.R.A.D. can detect. The Gray/Earth joint programI.S.M.’s are detectable and clearly visible to the naked eye, whilst theAnunnaki I.S.Ms are totally invisible and completely undetectable, as they jumpfrom one time-space pocket to another. Worth mention here to all our readers: The difference between “time-space”travel and “space-time” travel is this: In the mode of time-space, the humanmind cannot yet understand it, nor can the eyes see it, as we do not yet fullycomprehend the concept of time. In space-mode time however, human eyes canglimpse the craft, for a split second before it vanishes/jumps to anotherpocket. Only in this instance, does the space-time appear linearly to humans.One Anunnaki I.S.M. module is capable of covering up to 9,000 square miles.These mini-spaceship machines will be interconnected through a massive net ofrays that will seal off the Earth’s atmosphere when the Anunnaki return.The number of Anunnaki who will be operating this return mission is as yetunknown. Very few Anunnaki personnel will be needed to operate this enterprise.When this massive net of rays is interwoven, it forms a dark gray glueysubstance that appears to us as a blend of burning metal, bark and rubber withthe most awful foul odor imaginable!! The ghastly and noxious odor itself isenough to kill people. Light from the sun will be completely blocked out, asthis gluey substance, known to the Anunnaki as “Zafta”, forms a solidegg-shell-like casing around the entire planet from which there will be noescape.This will truly be the end of the world, and life on Earth as we know it.”Sorry all you “2012” believers, but Maximillien de Lafayette says it ain’t gonnahappen!! He will be inviting all of you to a big banquet come January 1 st 2013in Acapulco, Mexico with free Margaritas and Bloody Mary’s cocktails to go roundtill the sun goes down – no cover charge!! *** *** *** Efficient energy systems of the Anunnaki. Question by Angelique Doudnikova. Question: What kind of clean and efficient energy systems, and modes oftransportation will the Anunnaki introduce after 2022?Answer:After the cleansing is done, no oil, coal, natural gas, or any other carbonbased fuels will be used to power any car, machinery or mechanicalequipment/apparatus.Energy to power all of the above will be provided via satellites which harnesscosmic energy.By then even solar energy will be regarded as an archaic and rudimentary form ofharnessing energy.This will be made possible by the process of opening the Anunnaki cosmic Ba’abs,which are also the stargates to multiple dimensions.Eleven of these Ba’abs exist, within the multi-dimensional cosmic landscape,adjacent to Earth. *** *** *** [Image00196.jpg] Grand Central Station in downtown Chicago. Stargate over Chicago Questions from Matt Hoxtell, Chicago. Questions: Is there a stargate/Ba’ab in Chicago?Where exactly is it located, and what does it look like?How would you jump into a ba’ab?Is it part of the Anunnaki evacuation plan for humans upon their return in 2022?Answer:There is a huge cosmic Ba’ab/stargate over Chicago. But this one is quiteunique, because it is called a Madkhaal, which means in Ana’kh, an entrance,rather than a stargate. [Image00197.gif] Madison Square Garden. ___________________ Not all stargates are identical, nor do they function in the same manner. Thereare stargates that lead to another (singular) world, an incomprehensible worldof bent time-space. And there are stargates that lead you into paralleldimensions adjacent to our world.The one over Chicago leads you towards a dimension where time and space are nolonger linear. In this dimension, the laws of physics as they are known to us onearth no longer apply. The Madkhaal is located above Grand Central Station in downtown Chicago.It is oval and vibrates like a rubber band, very similar to a multiversemembrane, found in the perimeter of the eleven dimensions mentioned incontemporary quantum physics.It is neither visible to the naked eye nor can it be detected by any apparatuson Earth. Also worth mentioning here, is the subject of the “Anomaly ofStargates.”Stargates do vary in size, function, purpose and mobility, just like theextraterrestrial underwater plasma corridors, used to navigate our seas andoceans. The stargate in New York City, which is located over Madison Square Garden, istwice the size of that over Central Station in downtown Chicago. Travel to andfrom the Chicago stargate is possible at particular times, however travelthrough the Madison Square Garden Ba’ab is a one way street.Maximillien de Lafayette recommends this ba’ab for all televangelists anddivorce lawyers!!Since the Ba’abs are at least 900ft – 1,700ft above ground, it is not possibleto jump into a Ba’ab. At the time of the return of the Anunnaki, anelectromagnetic fog will suck up the people with light to medium contamination,as set forth by the Anunnaki’s return protocol. Signs before the return of the Anunnaki Question by Angelique Doudnikova. Question: What are the signs that people will see in the skies the day beforethe Anunnaki return, and where will they be seen?Answer:One year before the return of the Anunnaki, around the end of the year 2021, thegovernments of many countries will start to circulate publications and manualsdescribing signs that will indicate the appearance 0f extraterrestrial craftvisible to the public at large.I am convinced that many Bishops and Archbishops in the United States andEngland have already been briefed on the subject, and were secretly asked tocooperate on the redaction of material, that would suitably marry religiousdogma with “intelligent design”, as well as the frightening arrival ofextraterrestrials to our planet.Ironically, four major Anunnaki stargates will be activated and opened, whichreligious leaders will also interpret as the arrival of the “Four Horsemen” asstated in the Book of Revelation, and will be urging believers to run to theirchurches and pray. Readers and believers of the “Left Behind” series will haveanother shot at redemption…(Not!!)Meanwhile, from the end of 2021 to November 30 th , 2022 American citizens willhave the most unusual evacuation display of UFOs/USOs of all shapes and sizes(oval, circular,crescent-shaped, triangular, cylindrical and every other shapewitnessed, reported and ridiculed by the media, military disinformers anddebunkers alike.) These are the vehicles of the Gray aliens jointly operatedwith the military. Anunnaki’s “tool of annihilation” Question by Angelique Doudnikova. Question: Who/what created the “tool of annihilation” that the Anunnaki will usewhen they return?Answer:The “Tool of Annihilation” was created by the Majlas – the Anunnaki HighCouncil, as stated by Sinhar Anbar Anati, specifically for the purpose ofcleansing the earth from all its contamination upon their return in 2022.This tool of annihilation will be utilized in the event of hostile situations,where uninformed rednecks (Back in the saddle again) and other surburbaniteswill pull out their hunting rifles and shotguns to shoot at spaceships belongingto the most advanced race in the known universe. Those are the ones who aregoing to get it first! On Divination and Tarot Card Reading Questions by Salma Tabbah, Amman, Jordan. Question:Do the Ulema believe in divination and Tarot card reading?At the beginning I was skeptical, but after having consulted a Tarot reader, Ibecame a believer. She predicted things nobody knew or heard about. Sometimesher predictions touched on a very personal note. So my question to you is this:Is the Tarot something your people accept? Is it a game or the real thing?-SalmaTabbah. Note: We encourage the readers to refer to the book “Ulema Anunnaki Tarot.Extraterrestrial Lessons and Techniques to See your Future: The world’s mostpowerful book on the occult and foreseeing your future on Earth and in otherdimensions. Published in February 2010. Answer:Yes, the Anunnaki-Ulema have used a very unique “Divination” method to exploreultra-dimension. The word divination is not totally correct, but we are going touse it for now, because it is “As close as it gets to the real thing,” saidUlema Bukhtiar.We can also use the word “Oracle”, as these words refer to the same thing inessence.The other term “Ultra-dimension” means a “Surrounding that is not normally andusually detected by scientific or physical means,” said Ulema Seif El Din. Thisultra-dimension belongs to the realm of many things, including thoughts,perception, extra-sensory feelings (Not caused by anomaly of any sort), and adepot of knowledge that evolves around past, present and future events. One ofthe aspects of the Ulema’s Kira’at deals with Tarot card reading calledBak’ht-Kira’at. The Master taps into a zone that contains lots of informationabout events to occur in the future.The figures and numbers he/she opens up while reading the cards are closelyrelated to that zone called “Da-irat Al-Maaref” (Circumference of Knowledge).The figures and numbers that appear on the cards guide the Master reader towardsa chart that contains and explains all the possible meanings, NOTinterpretation.“But this is not enough, we should not rely only on symbols and numbers, becausethis could happen in a very ordinary manner, far from the truthful reach ofknowledge and discovery…it could fall into the possibility of coincidences. Thisis why, a reading should be repeated multiple times to detect coincidence andseparate superstitions from reality...” explained the Honorable Ulema Ghandar.*** *** *** Question:If your answer is yes, then would you please explain the difference betweenregular Tarot cards and Ulema tarot cards?Answer:I will give you a brief explanation.The Ulema cards are personalized, meaning they are hand-made by you. You do notpurchase your Ulema cards from a store. They are not a commercial product. TheMaster provides you with a set of 50 cards called “Warka”. Each card has eithera figure or a symbol (Number). The cards are printed on a master-sheet or onseveral sheets. You cut each card individually, until you have 50 cards.This constitutes your personal cards deck. Nobody else should touch or use thisdeck. The Master will instruct you to attach one of your photos to one specificcard. You can place your photo on this card and xerox it, and later add it tothe deck. This card is extremely important, because the whole deck will rotatearound it.Something else: One of the 50 cards must bear your name. Also, you should giveyourself a new surname. Nobody should know about your new name; it should remainsecret. What we have so far is this:a-A set of 50 cards, cut and laminated by you.b-One of the cards has your photo.c-One of the cards has your real name (First name).d-One of the cards has your new name. (The one you gave yourself)Now you start to understand why the Ulema cards are called “Personalized”. Question :OK, would I be able to learn about my future if I use the Ulema Tarot cards?Answer :Enough, but not everything. First, you have to remember that if your “Conduit”is not activated, your access to knowledge about your future will be limited.However, you will be able to learn a lot about some events that are extremelyimportant in your life, and especially about “New happenings or things tohappen” that can influence or alter your luck, success, and other vital matters.The cards will give you some guidance and orientation.The cards will give you dates and a warning related to each separate event tooccur in the future; event(s) detected by your cards.Something else you should know: If you attach the photo of another person to oneof the cards, you could possibly discover lots of things about that person.However, you will not able to influence his/her mind, or bring a major change tohis/her life, unless some criteria are met. *** *** ***Question:Is there a particular book on the Anunnaki-Ulema Tarot? If yes, who wrote it? Isit about the past, present or the future?What did the Ulema say about the future?Is it already written for us?Can we change our future?Answer:Note: The following answer is taken from our Tarot Book.Ulema Mordachai ben Zvi said, “Bakht (Ulema Tarot) has been practiced by theUlema Anunnaki for thousands of years.It is totally unknown in the Western hemisphere.Essentially, Bakht is based upon knowledge received from the early remnants ofthe Anna.Ki, also called Anu.Na.Ki, an extra-terrestrial race which landed onEarth hundreds of thousands of years ago.Very few seers and mystics outside the circle of the Ulema Anunnaki penetratedthe secrets of the Bakht. They were the elite of the priests of Ra, the earlySinhar Khaldi (Early Chaldean priests/astrologers/astronomers), the Tahar (EarlyPhoenician Purification priests), and the Rouhaniyiin, known in the West as thealchemists/Kabalists.In the whole world today, there are no more 700 persons who practice the Bakht,and they are called Ba-khaat or Bakhaati. Two hundred of them are the supremeenlightened masters, called the Mounawariin.The other five hundred masters are simply called Ulema Anunnaki. The teachers ofthe Ba-khaat or Bakhaati are called Tahiriim and the Ulema refer to them as theBaal-Shamroutiim.The earliest manuscript on Bakht appeared in Phoenicia, circa 7,500 B.C., and itwas written in Ana’kh. A later version in Anakh-Pro-Ugaritic appeared threethousand years later. A third version written in the early Phoenician-Byblos script appeared in Byblosand Tyre. There are also two versions in Akkadian and the Old Babylonianlanguage, that are assumed to be lost. Around 65 A.D., a new version in Arabicappeared in the Arabian Peninsula, and Persia, and it was called “Firasa”.Around 685 A.D., a revised edition appeared in Damascus, Syria.It was said that, from this Syrian edition, the hand-written manuscript “Ilmu AlDonia” (Science or Knowledge of the Universe) was derived.This manuscript included chapters on Arwah (Spirits and non-human entities),Djins, and Afrit.Around 1365 A.D., a book titled “Shams Al Maaref Al Koubra” appeared in Cairoand Damascus, based upon two books “Al Bakht: Dirasat Al Moustakbal”, and “IlmuAl Donia”.”Maximillien de Lafayette said, “The future is neither concealed, nor hidden,because the future has already happened in a zone or Zamania that exists veryclose to the zone or sphere of existence, that you already live in.In other words, the past, present and future are timelines that exist and runconcurrently, called Istimraar.”Does this mean that every event is constantly being repeated indefinitely indifferent worlds, dimensions and times?Yes, it is, according to mainstream science and quantum physics – based upon thetheory of the “Ever expanding universe.” –And according to the Ulema Anunnaki, people (Humans and other life-forms) livesimultaneously on different Woujoud and Zaman.Most certainly, they might look different, physically and bio-organically,because of the atmospheric and climate conditions, and they could or would actdifferently –convergent or divergent– according to the level of their awarenessand intelligence in different worlds.Consequently, you can live a past on this Earth and remember very well pastevents in your life, and in the same time, you remain unaware of your otherexistences, other pasts and lives in different worlds.Henceforth, you must learn what has happened or what is currently happening toyou, or to your other copies, either on different planets and habitats, or inhigher dimensions.Now, you begin to know that each one of us has infinite copies of ourselves, aswell as, many separate and independent past(s).Knowing the future and revisiting your past in different dimensions and previouslives is a pre-requisite for reading your Bakht Haya.Ti (Linear Future), andMoustakbal Daa-em (Multidimensional Future).There are some events in your past that greatly influence the course of yourlife, and part of your future. The situation gets a little bit tricky, when youare not fully aware of major events, and decisions you have made in yourMoustakbal Daa-em, because few of us are capable of visiting our past(s) indifferent dimensions.The future in its two forms, linear and multidimensional is what reallyconstitutes your true future.However, it is not absolutely necessary to learn about all the phases of yourpast, and what your Double or your other copies in different time-space zoneshave done in the past, and/or are currently doing in a zone beyond Earth.If you believe that life continues after death, then it becomes necessary tolearn about your Double, and other bio-organic and etheric copies of yourselfthat currently exist in other worlds.On Earth, in this world, we have one single future. The learned Ulema referredto it as Al Maktoob, meaning what was written. This concept has created anintellectual, philosophical and religious controversy, even an outrage, for allthose who have rejected the idea that a Supreme Creator has already imposed uponus, a future, the moment we were born; a future that controls our destiny andour life, for ever!In other words, what it is already written in the front-page of our life,dictates the magnitude, level and development of our future successes, failures,kind of job or profession reserved for us, our health conditions, finances,families, how good or how bad our children will be in the future, sort andamount of joy and pain we will feel in the forthcoming years of our lives, soon…Others have felt that the Al Maktoob makes us slaves of the Creator, because ourdestiny has been decided upon, without our knowledge, consent and will.If this is the case, then our life has no purpose at all, and no matter how hardwe try to reach a higher level of spirituality and awareness, we will alwaysfail because, it was written in the book of our future, that we have no choice,no freedom to choose and above all, it was already written, that our efforts inthis context were not to bear fruit. Thus, it becomes impossible for any of usto change our future, and/or re-write what it is already written and decidedupon, in the book of life and destiny.Consequently, learning about our Bakht (Future) would not serve any purpose,except to make us feel trapped in this life. This is what many people, and someof the early Gnostics have felt about this unpleasant and horrible scenario. Butthe Ulema Anunnaki have a different scenario for all of us; a pleasant and ahappy one.Humans have retained their freedom of choice, thus, they are accountable for alltheir actions, deeds, intentions and thoughts.They have the right and the freedom to choose, select and carry on their ownplans. And in the process of doing so, they remain the masters of their owndestiny, and solely responsible for their decisions, and the consequences ofthese decisions.Their mental faculties and degree of their creativity are shaped by, and decidedupon by many factors, such as the Conduit, the Jabas, and the Fikr.But their destiny and future remain unconditioned by the DNA, the Conduit andother genetic “ingredients” fashioned by the Anunnaki. Theethical-moral-spiritual endeavors and aspects of their physical and non-physicalstructures remain under their personal control.This part of their future can be learned about and read by using the Bakht. Inaddition, humans’ present and future decisions and actions, and the consequencesof their deeds and intentions could be altered or changed, according to theirfree will and personal choices.All these decisions, deeds, intentions, consequences, and effects are part ofone single future, which can be changed at will.But the remaining part of their future which is conditioned by the geneticformula of the Anunnaki cannot be changed, unless the Conduit is fully activatedReading the Bakht, guides you in this direction, and explains to you what partof your future can be changed, and what part of your future will remain intact.This, applies exclusively to your future on Earth; your Erdi future.So, are we trapped in this life?Are we at the mercy of the Anunnaki?Is our life, destiny and future already decided upon, by the Anunnaki whocreated us by using multiple genetic techniques and experiments?Do we have the power, the choice and the freedom to change our future?If so, is it the whole future or part of it?You will find the answers to these questions while you are reading your Bakht.And step by step, you will learn what is going to happen to you in this life, inthe present, in the near future, and in the distant future, simply because yourpresent and future exist simultaneously as you read your Bakht.In addition, when you consult the Ulema Anunnaki Tarot on different subjects andmatters of concern, the cards will tell you what you should do and consider, andwhat you should avoid. It will become crystal clear, and future events will bedisplayed right before your eyes.You have to remember that the Ulema Anunnaki Tarot is a reading of many of yourfutures; one on Earth, and the others in different zones of times and spaces.As you progress in this field of Ulema Tarot, and as you begin to learn moreabout other dimensions, and copies of yourself in other worlds, your mind willstart to understand gradually how things work in different dimensions, andparticularly how you and part of your multidimensional futures are projected. *** *** *** On inner bio-rhythm, bad luck, good luck & Anunnaki Questions asked by Salem Turbi, Tunisia. Question: Is it true what some mediums have said that some people areconditioned by a bio-rhythm that creates good luck and bad luck?If so, can we change this rhythm and become luckier, if we were not so lucky inthe first place? Was this rhythm created by the Anunnaki when they manipulatedour DNA?Answer:“Zara-Du”, also called “Macari,” and “Sabata,” is a term for what it is known inAnunnaki-Ulema literature as the “17 Lucky Years of Your Life.” Zaradu is veryimportant metaphysical but also “Physical knowledge” that the Anunnaki-Ulemahave learned, and kept shrouded in secrecy for thousands of years, fearing thatbad/immoral persons might learn and use to it to influence others, and selfishlyalter the course of history. It was revealed to the honorable Ulema that every single human being on planetEarth will have during his/her life, a lucky period extending through 17consecutive, uninterrupted years.During those years (Called Mah-Zu-Zah) the doors of luck, fortune anddevelopment at many levels will open up, and opportunities for extraordinarysuccess shall be freely given to her/him.This is how the phrase “the 17 Lucky Years of Your Life” came to exist. And forthis period of 17 years, there is a calendar, which is well structured, anddivided into a sequence of 77 by 7.This brings us to the Anunnaki-Ulema magical esoteric number of 777, consideredto be the Alpha and Omega of all knowledge and “Tana-Wur”, which meansenlightenment, similar to the Bodhisattva.At one point during these lucky years, a person will acquire two extraordinaryfaculties:> a- Rou’h Ya> b- Firasa (Fi raa-Saa).> These two faculties will positively influence his/her life and guide him/hereffortlessly towards reaching the highest level of mental and physical strength,as well success in business and a variety of endeavors. [Image00198.gif] Ulema-Anunnaki, Alain “Allan” Cardec. ________________________________ Examples of these endeavors for instance, are an astonishing power or capabilityof producing, writing or composing in an exceptionally prolific manner. It alsoencompasses the ability to learn many languages in next to no time, and readmanuscripts written in secret languages, such as the first secret and hiddenalphabet (Characters) of the Hindu language.Applied in modern times, reading the secret symbols and alphabets becomeforecasting events and predicting the rise and fall of world’s markets. It wasalso said, that this 17 year period can alter a DNA sequence, thus preventingaccelerated aging, and the deterioration of human cells. One of the last Anunnaki-Ulema Mounawariin (Enlightened Ones) known to havediscovered the secret of the 17 lucky years was Alan Cardec “Allan Cardec”(October 3, 1804- March 31, 1869). Cardec’s real name was Hippolyte LéonDenizard Rivail. And his Ulema name was Asha-Kar-Da-Ki. His mentor was thelegendary Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, also known as “Mirdach Kadoshi Sirah” inthe Anunnaki-Ulema circle. His incarnated guiding master (Second high level ofAnunnaki-Ulema) was Al Zafiru, called Sefiro or Zefiro in mediumship andspiritism literature. In fact, the word or term “Spiritism” was coined byCardec.He was the first to use it and explain its application during a contact with ahigher entity and other rapports with dead people (Trapped deceased persons) whoasked for his help. Sometimes, it was the other way around; Cardec asked fortheir guidance on matters related to life after death, and the realm of the nextlife.Master Cardec was the father of the French movement of Spiritism, andcommunications with entities trapped between the next dimension and Earth’sboundaries. They are called “Les retenus”, meaning those who were trapped in theafterlife dimension, or more precisely, those who were detained. Cardec wasburied at the historical French cemetry “Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise”.The inscription on his tomb stele reads: \" Naitre, mourir, renaitre encore etprogresser sans cesse, telle est la loi.” Translated verbatim: “ To be born, todie, to be reborn again, and to progress unceasingly, such is the law.”The inner bio-rhthym and the Anunnaki:Thousands of years ago, before history was recorded, the Anunnaki created Man tomeet their needs. They created us as a work-force to take care of the fields,cultivate the land, and bring them food; this is according to theAkkadian/Sumerian clay tablets. It is very clear.At that time, when the Anunnaki gods and goddesses (Aruru, Mummu, Ea, Ninna,etc.) created the first prototypes of the quasi-human races, Man did not haveall the mental faculties we have today. Later on, 13 new faculties were added tohis brain. And everything in the brain was wired and functioned according to acellular rhythm.We cannot change this rhythm.But we can improve on it, and ameliorate its functioning, by acquiring newknowledge, developing a stronger memory, reading, writing, listening tointelligent and well-informed people, getting rid of bad habits, and elevatingour being to a higher mental/spiritual level, through int rospection,meditation, and refraining from hurting others. Some are born normal, others areborn with some mental deficiency, while a few were created as geniuses, likeBach, Mozart, Da Vinci etc., people who astonished us with extraordinarycreativity, and unmatched talents.These talents and mental gifts were already “placed” into their Conduit.Otherwise, how can we explain the astonishing musical compositions of Mozart andother great composers at the age of 4? Yes, we can alter the inner bio-rythm,the Anunnaki installed in us, but we cannot change it completely. The firstthing to do is to activate the Conduit.As far as luck (Good and bad) is concerned, the noble in spirit (Mind, or “Soul”if you want) will be given the opportunities and means to learn how to positively reshape future events in his/her life.Unfortunately, there are so many good people in the world who are constant lysuffering. And we wonder where is the logic? What is the reason for theirsuffering? Is it true that good people always finish last? Sadly enough, ithappens all the time.We see hard-working nurses (who save lives) struggling to make a living. We seedevoted school teachers unable to pay their bills.We see bloody bastards gettingricher and richer, whilst honorable, loving and caring people are being kickedout of their homes!! Where is the justice?The truth I tell you, is that there is no justice on Earth, despite all the goodintentions of so many of us, and despite so many good courts’ decisions, anddecent laws to maintain law and order. The Ulema taught us that good behavior, ahigh level of morality, unconditional love, forgiveness and generosity do notguarantee success in life, or secure good luck. Ulema Badri said verbatim: “Yourcharacter and good manners are the only things you should keep when you havelost everything in life. To some, this is not enough, for financial security,and some good luck would not hurt.I agree. So, start developing your brain, activate your Conduit, ta lk to yourinner-self…there you will find the salvation…there you will find a way to changeyour bad luck into good luck. If your Mind is in harmony with your “Jaba”, then,and only then, can you change your inner bio- rhythm, and influence your DNA’smetamorphosis.” *** *** *** Were dinosaurs created by extraterrestrials? Question by Matt Hoxtell, Chicago, Illinois, USA. Question: Were dinosaurs created by extraterrestrials?Answer:Not every life-form on Earth was created by the Anunnaki. It is important toremember that when the first expedition of the Anunnaki landed on Earth, ourplanet was already populated by an amazing variety of living organisms, animals,quasi-human species, the earliest of human-animal forms, synthesized molecules,substances and biological entities. Many of these life-forms were created fromcosmic dust.Some were the result of photosynthesis, and other groups were produced bybacteria and evolution inertia. Worth mentioning here, is that the Anunnaki hadno interest or motivation in creating/altering the creation of pre-existinglife-forms that were deemed unnecessary or not very essential for startingand/or carrying on their projects on Earth.The dinosaurs existed on planet Earth, long before the Anunnaki descended toEarth.The dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago, and their reign lastedover 100 million years. The Anunnaki arrived to Earth circa 449,000 B.C. Besides, the Anunnaki(any expedition) did not consider the dinosaurs, orremnants of the dinosaurs and similar reptiles, necessary or useful for theirplans for two reasons:> • a -They lacked mental/intellectual faculties, necessary for understanding> the instructions of the Anunnaki;> • b -Their enormous size. *** *** *** The lost continent of MU's connection with the Anunnaki Question by Ismail Kemal Ciftcioglu, Turkey. Question: This is the most important question for me. In any of the books Iread, I haven’t come across any information about the lost continent of MU'sconnection with the Anunnaki. I assume you know lots of things about it.According to James Churchward's books, MU was even older than Atlantis and hometo the human civilization. Humans migrated from MU all over the world. But weknow that the Anunnaki were in Mesopotamia.So what about it? What can you tell me about the lost continent of MU?Answer:I. Introduction/Mythological backgound:According to legend and esoteric myth , Mu was a large continent of an advancedcivilization. It sank beneath the ocean many thousands of years ago.The story or Myth of Mu appeared for the first time in the 19 th century, thanksto the writings of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825-1908), who claimed that thesurvivors of Mu went to the Americas and established the Mayan Empire.Then, in the first half of the 20 th century, the prolific writer and visionaryextraordinaire James Churchward popularized the story of Mu in a series of bookshe wrote: “ The Children of Mu” published in 1931; “The Lost Continent of Mu”published in 1933, and “The Sacred Symbols of Mu”, published in 1935.And in the 1930’s, Kamal Atatürk (Baba Kamal) then leader of Turkey, yourmajestic country, generously funded academic and scientific research on Mu.The great Tur kish leader thought that perhaps he would be able to establish adirect link or some sort of connection betweek Turkey and the world’s firstcivilizations that could include the Aztec, and the Maya. Unfortunately, allattempts to prove the existence of MU failed. II. Scientific/geological facts:First of all, you have to remember that the Anunnaki were not only inMesopotamia.The first expedition of the Anunnaki to Earth, occurred some 449,000 years ago.They landed in the Near East (Phoenicia) and explored the territories ofMadagascar, Brazil, Central Africa, Turkey (Anatolia) etc., and finally theyestablished their kingdom in Mesopotamia. The continent of MU was already inexistence, long, long before the Mesopotamian civilization.And Atlantis was the bridge between the remnants of Mu, the pre-historiccivilization of Crete, Phoenicia(Modern day Lebanon), Ugarit, Arwad, Egypt,Mesopotamia, the lands of the Hittites in Anatolia, and Cyprus.Mu was established some 14,000 to 20,000 years ago, and its civilization wasdestroyed some 9,500 to 10,000 years ago, but MU itself did not \"sink\" under theocean, as many have claimed, simply because scientifically speaking, continentsdo not sink; they might shift, drift, and break into two, three or severalparts, but this is a very very long geolocial process that takes hundreds ofmillions of years.Except for Pangaea, hi story, archeology, anthropology and oceanography tell usthat continents have maintained their original position.Thus, for the continent of MU to change its original position as a continent, orto sink to the bottom of the ocean, these events and changes should haveoccurred at the time Pangaea shifted some 250 millions years ago, or even duringthe shift of Pannotia, that was formed on Earth some 600 million years ago, orRodinia (formed some 1.2 billion years ago) which has totally shifted some 750million years ago.Yet once again, geography, natural history, oceanography, anthropology, thestudy of fossils, and the history of comparative civilizations have not providedany proof that a new shift has ever occurred after those dates.Thus, the idea that an early advanced civilization existed hundreds of millionsof years ago on a vanished continent is pure fantasy, ridiculed by science.In conclusion, the civilization of MU must have existed around 14,000 to 20,000years ago, and during that period, no continent has ever shifted. Therefore, thesinking of MU to the bottom of the ocean is an impossibility. III. Anunnaki-Ulema views: [Image00199.gif] Baalbeck, one of the earliest cities/colonies of the Anunnaki on Earth.______________________________ Ulema have suggested that MU and Atlantis were one and the same; a community,instead of a continent. This makes it more logical to assume that a migration ofa community to another part of the world, including Baalbeck, Tyre, Sidon,Turkey, Anatolia, the Near East/the Middle East could have occurred.In addition, this migration could also explain the sudden emergence of anadvanced civilization that we know little about.The early community of Mu or Atlantis or both, since they were consideredepistemologically and anthropologically the same, had a highly advancedcivilization and well-structured societies, “implanted” by an extraterrestrialrace. And the only extraterrestrial race that left some historical and mythologicaldocuments and records on Earth were the Anunnaki. This is the only and mostlogical link we can attach to the people of MU/Atlantis.Anunnaki-Ulema Sadek ben Alia Al Bakri stated verbatim: “The Anunnaki had adirect contact with those people, and taught them science, technology, language,and the use of advanced learning techniques and tools. They went to theNear/Middle East and established their new colonies, always under thesupervision of the Anunnaki.”Ulema Sharif Al Takki Al Zubyani (1797-1877) stated that Mu did exist some50,000 years ago according to the Ulemite calendar (14,000-20,000 years in ourcalendar).He added that the original name of Mu was Mari, and it was inhabited by peoplewho were very advanced in “Ilm Al Falak”, meaning space science. An enormousexplosion happened on the continent, caused by the reflection of light and raysemitted by a gigantic “Miraya”, which means mirrors, triggered by a huge volcanoeruption.Coincidentally or strangely enough, the Anunnaki and Ulemite literature referredto the Miraya as a galactic tool used to receive and emit cosmic messages, asort of beam (Possibly atomic or laser), as well as to record and decode eventsfrom the past, the present and the future. Al Zubyani added: “Those mirrors werealso used as weapons, and if they are not handled properly, they could destroy awhole country.”Those who know Arabic, including the archaic dialect of the Arab Peninsula, andAna’kh will find out that there is a very close relation (Perhaps linguisticallyonly) between the Name Mari and the Arabic, pre-Islamic word Mir’aat (Mir’-aatand Miraya) which means in both languages (Ana’kh and Arabic) mirror. Strangely enough, the French word “Miroir” and the English word mirror arederived directly from the Ana’kh (Anunnaki language) Miraya. So here we have amillion year old Anunnaki word “Miraya”, a 50,000 year old name “Mari”, a 7,000year old Ulemite word “Mirra-ya”, and a 5,000 year old Arabic word Miraya! Anyconnection? IV. So, what did we learn from all this?We have learned the following:> • The continent of MU did not sink to the bottom of the ocean, because> scientifically, continents do not sink. [Image00200.gif]Map of Pangaea._________________________________ > • 2- Some sort of ecological or geological catastrophe occurred some 9,500 to> 10,000 years ago that forced the population of that part of the world to flee> and seek refuge somewhere else, probably in the countries I have mentioned> earlier.

Question by anonymous: I can’t understand how you could write so many books insuch a short time? Do you use some sort of magic or a supernatural power? Youknow what, some people are spreading rumors that the overwhelming number of yourbooks you wrote were made by a machine and because of this you are a machine.Answer:Many, like you, have asked how did I manage to write hundreds of books in ashort time, or to be able to speak so many languages, and accomplish multipletasks simulteneously?Some have dubbed me superhuman, others have called me nuts, and a few have saidthat the fact that I have written so many books so in such a short period oftime, means that I have got to be a scam. This amuses me a lot, because nosupernatural powers or machines are associated with what I do.I can assure anybody, absolutely anybody can do what I have done, effortlesslyif some techniques are learned and utilized.And these technniques are associated with how you organize your mind. I will tryto explain this very simply. Your mind is a wonderful machine composed of Jabas,a collection of pockets or drawers, similar to your computer. When your computeris loaded with temporary internet files, searching, loading and uploading willslow your computer down considerably.Thus, you have to delete your temporary files, in order to speed up yourcomputer, and have more space on your hard drive. The same thing applies to yourmind.When your Jabas are full with old and unnecessay information, your mind slowsdown; becoming slow in acquiring, storing, organizing, sorting and analyzing newinformation. In addition to the clearing (Cleaning, emptying) of your Jabas, youmust let your Supersymetric mind work on it’s own.You have to sit, and start talking to yourself. Mind you while you are doingthat, your brain is independently listening to you. First of all, you have toconvince yourself that you can do it.Never understimate yourself or your personal powers.The fact that you do not have – apparently – supernatural powers, does not meanthat you cannot accomplish amazing things, even extraordinary deeds by normalstandards. Yes you can.! And it is so easy if you start to believe in yourself,in a new and different way.This opens part of your “Mind Pockets/Jabas.” Please refer to the book “TheUlema Anunnaki Forbidden Book of Ramadosh”; as it explains how this can be done.Basically, your brain is full of junk and storage you do not need. So, as afirst step, you have to get rid of this junk. It is easy to do. You start byasking yourself, what did you put in your mind, in the past and now, ten yearsago and today?This exersize is good, simply because you begin to inquire about what you havealready learned in your life. It is as if you are probing your own brain,confidentially in the privacy and comfort of your own space . *** *** *** Scanning brilliant minds to create a “Super-Baby”! Question by Akram Jibril, UAE. Question: I am not sure who has said aliens can scan our brain and create a newspecies of babies for their hybrid program. Is it true? Can they do that? Andhow it is done?Answer:Ulema Oppenheimer and Ulema Govinda commented on “Mind Scanning” andduplicating-multiplying brains’ potentials:From their Kira’at, verbatim: Scanning your brain and body to create a new copyof “You” for a new-born baby.They scan you, mind and body, and place the scan in an “Aetra” mold to recreateyou and duplicate you; they can make as many copies as they want. On the top ofthe “Scan Mold”, there is a transparent cover “Kha-Tar” that looks likefiberglass.As soon as the scan process begins, the Khatar starts to work, meaning, itstarts to reshape itself into a human form, the physical form of your body inits miniscule details.So what we have here, is “you” imprinted three dimensionally on a sheet of afiberglass. This is the “Physical Scan”. What is more facinating, is the“Kha-tra-Fikr”, which is the “Mental Scan” of your brains, all your thoughts,feelings, beliefs, memories and intentions.At the end, they either mix the physical scan with the mental scan to recreate acopy of you, or install your brain into another body (Not Yours), or attachedyour body to the brain of another scanned person.Now, imagine if they keep on - indefinitely - duplicating and reduplicatingthese scans, physically and mentally, how many millions of new hybrid peoplewould be created? More than you can count!!In some instances, at birth, some of them have already implanted scanned brainsinto the brain/mind of new born babies. The baby is 2 hours old, but his/hermemory is 50 years old.The new born’s mind is almost virgin and clean like a dry sponge, but with theirgenetic manipulation, they can feed this “virgin mind” with the contents ofbrilliant minds they have scanned for hundreds of years.So what we have here is a superbaby, an infant who is more intelligent than allthe geniuses on Earth, combined! *** *** *** Is the Ulema-Anunnaki group administered by men or a matriarch woman? Question by Rita Montiel, Madrid, Spain. Question: Is the Ulema-Anunnaki group administered by men or a matriarch womanas I have heard?Answer:No, the Ulema are not exclusively all men. In fact, the head of one Ma’had(Center/Institute) is Umdasturia; a magnificent woman. And her name is quiteinteresting and revealing.Those who know Turkish, Arabic, Farsi, and some ancient Middle Eastern languageswill be able to know what her name means. Well, Um means mother, and Dasturiameans the law, or the constitution of the Ulema’s assembly.By the way, the assembly is called Majlas.In the eye of Baal Shamroot and Ameliku (the great supreme Sinhars of theAnunnaki), even though men and women are equal, women remain far more superiorto men.Women are the first and exclusive source of Man’s life and existence in theknown universe. Women are the first cell and the first molecule of the life ofall men. The earliest Akkadian-Babylonian- Sumerian tablets tell us that theearly women on Earth, the offspring of the Anunnaki and Igigi did not need men’ssperm to fertilize their eggs and give birth to babies.Women-goddesses were self-reproductive, and could give birth to babies withouthaving intercourse with a man. But they lost this capability, by constantlyinterbreeding with Earth’s men and continuously engaging in sexual acts withEarth’s “creatures”. According to the Akkadian-Sumerian tablets, at thebeginning of time, the second most powerful person in the universe was a womangoddess - creator of the universe, and of men.She was called Tiamat. But Tiamat was dethroned and killed by a male god knownas Marduk. The male scribes and the kings needed to restore the “Authority ofMan” over everything, thus they created the myth of Marduk and justified thereason for his killing Tiamat. [Image00203.gif] Marduk fighting the dragon Tiamat. ______________________________ Marduk fighting the dragon Tiamat, and putting an end to her major influence onthe affairs of the universe, the state and Man. By doing so, Marduk became theabsolute and most powerful god of the Anunnaki, the Igigi, and Babylon. [Image00204.gif] Marduk chasing and fighting Tiamat. Eventually, Marduk will slaughter Tiamat, and from parts of her body, Mardukwill create the universe, according to the Akkadian-Babylonian tablets. *** *** *** The relationship between our mind, body and cellular memory? Question by Tony Rossi, Bocan Raton, Florida. Question: What is the relationship between our mind, body and cellular memory?Answer:“Do you think you are seeing yourself as a physical reality when you in amirror? Think again. Some highly evolved people extend to the outside perimeterof their physical body…” said Ulema Li.Anunnaki Ulema ben Yacob stated: “You too, can do this…you can transcend thephysical boundaries of your body. There are two presences/substances that madeyou what and who you are:> • a -You as a person;> • b -You as a human being. The human being is the physical form of yourself.The “Person” is what constitutes everything about yourself.There are lots of things (Matter and Mind) about you that are somewhere you arenot aware of. Part of you exists in a tree, in a river, in a thought, in amemory cell, in a beautiful song, in a dream, in another country, and waybeyond; in dimensions that most recently were elaborated on, by quantum physics’leading thinkers and pioneers.You have to find out everything that is part of you, in order to reachextraordinary standards of intelligence, and unmatched success at multiplelevels.Part of your “Extraordinary Intelligence” rotates around cellular memory.Do you know where your cellular memory is?Is it in your physical body, or in your psyche?Is it in you “The Person”, or in you the “Human Entity”?And why is cellular memory so important to be concerned about?It is important, because that memory is everything you have experienced andlearned from, as well as the stimulus and conditioner of your judgment, analysisand the understanding of the world you live in.But it is not perfect because it is not complete.You have to tap into both segments of yourself, the physical body that takes youfrom your home to your office, and the “Person” that transports you from alimited physical sphere of knowledge to the ultimate and highest zone ofawareness, that is so close to you, close to your physical body.There, you will find the ultimate truth about yourself, how much information andknowledge you have stored within you before you were born, after you were born,and what you are going to be once you are no longer here.You are too important to be confined in 150 pounds, 190 pounds, 200 pounds, 5feet, or 6 feet 11. You are much bigger and denser than you think. So tap intothe missing part of yourself. It is so enjoyable, so remunerating, soprofitable, and so powerful.Visit yourself iin other dimensions, rediscover the zone you that are not fullyaware of exists. It belongs to you, and to you alone.Once there, you will reinforce your physical and mental powers and energies.The denser the body of your other person is, the healthier you become. Thatother person you may call whatever you want: a guardian, an angel, an ethericpresence, your double. All are the very same thing. People who have succeeded inblending with the other part of themselves that extends beyond and outside theirphysical mass of muscles, feet, hands and lungs, have accomplished extraordinarythings. You too, you can do it. It just requires a certain degree of belief,practice and determination.Where is this other part of me, you might ask?It is so close to your physical body, and wherever you go, it goes with you, itdoes not follow you, but accompany you. You have to make a deal with it.You have to reach some sort of agreement with it. An agreement to chat together,to meet somewhere, and go from there.If you don’t converse with your own mind, you will never work out/exercize themental muscles in your brain, and if you do not increase the size and strengthof your mental muscles, your intellect will shrink. *** *** ***Anunnaki-Phoenician Chavad-nitrin and the immortality of the gods Question by Georges Haddad, Michigan. Question: I am originally from Byblos (Jbeil) in Lebanon, and we Lebanese aredescendants of the Crusaders who learned some of the secrets of the Anunnaki inLebanon and Jerusalem. I have heard that my ancestors the Phoenicians have useda product similar to athletes’ steroids. This product I was told was also usedby the Egyptian Pharaohs. Could you please tell me more about it? Many thanks. [Image00205.gif]Roman pillars leading up to the temple of Balaat Gebal, in Byblos, Phoenicia,where the Chavad-nitrin was used by the priests of Baal.____________________ Answer:Correct, that product was called “Chavad-nitrin”, after an ancient Phoenicianembalming process, learned from Byblos and Arwad Anunnaki remnants, usingMah’rit (Maha-reet), a secret substance considered to be humanity’s firstformula for steroids, mixed with barks from the cedars of Phoenicia. It wasfrequently used by athletes in Ugarit, Amrit, and Arwad.From Chavad-nitrin, derived the Greek word Natron or Natrin, a substance used inthe embalming process.Because of the reported physical endurance and legendary longevity it produced,the Egyptians equated the words Neter, Netjer and Netjet with the immortality ofthe gods.According to Egyptian tradition, the first human being to be mummified was thegod Osiris, whose body floated down the Nile in a wooden casket, and washedashore at Byblos (Your hometown) in Phoenicia. [Image00206.gif] God Osiris. ___________________ [Image00207.gif] Ruins of the ancient city of Ugarit._______________________ For this reason, Byblos was a sacred region to Osiris, to his cult, and to theEgyptians. This explains the reason why the Egyptians have called Byblos theland of the god Osiris; Ta Netjer. *** *** *** Hidden entrances to other worlds and dimensions, right here on Earth Question by Isabelle Franchot, and Emile Farkas, Beverly Hills, California. Question: Do UFOs and extraterrestrials use galactic entrances and space-timecorridors to enter and exit our world? And how many are there? Are they visibleto the naked eye?Answer:There are several unseen, hidden, and undetectable entrances to three differentdimensions beyond ours:> 1. Entrance(s) to the after-life (After death);> 2. Entrances to the fourth dimension;> 3. Entrance(s) to the parallel dimension (Ba’ab) Each dimension (Zone) is a totally different world in structure, substance,composition, and boundaries. Some are extremely close to us. Closer than youmight think.I will explain: a-Entrance to the after-life:This is called life after death. And it is exactly what you might think. Therealm of deceased people. Only dead people enter this zone, and they neverreturn. The Babylonians called it “The Land of no Return”.It was mentioned in their epics. In some passages, it was called Kur inAkkadian. On their way into that dimension, deceased people encounter all sortsof entities, benevolent and malevolent. This is not my personal theory. I didnot invent such a story. This was mentioned thousands of years ago in theEgyptian Book of the Dead, in the Tibetan “Bardo Todol”, and many other textsfrom various ancient cultures. b-Entrance to the fourth dimension:This is a zone that a person can enter in two manners, mentally and physically.This zone could have entrances everywhere; in your bedroom, in a valley, in abuilding corridor, absolutely everywhere and anywhere. And this includes theoceans, the bottom of the sea, in thin air, and right inside your home doors.Many people have been sucked-up, absorbed by its “Pulling Force” (Magneticfield) in a split second.Once they are attracted or pulled in by these entrances, they zoom inside theentrance at incredible speed.For incomprehensible reasons, these entrances could open up and close atanytime, any moment. And as soon as a person or an object is swallowed up by thecurrent (Flux-Influx) of those entrances, the entrance shut’s its opening(Overture) in on itself.Those kinds of entrances are situated everywhere in our world. There is vastliterature on people, vehicles, animals who have vanished into thin air, in asplit second. Highly advanced alien races know exactly where the locations ofthese entrances are, as well as their currents and times of opening and closing.They have used these entrances as corridors and passages for millions of years.Many of their spaceships have navigated through these channels. Some Ulema haveexplained the passages of these entrances as a net of time and space bending onitself, and thus reducing distances and time between points and destinations.Sometimes, UFOs sharp angular turns and zigzag pattern indicate where theseentrances are located in the skies. This is why Ulema have said that UFOS do notfly, they jump. Meaning, they jump from one pocket to another.In other words, these pockets are nothing more than entrances to a higherdimension; the fourth dimension.I am absolutely sure that several scientists working on classified outer-spaceprograms (sponsored by some governments) have already worked on projects relatedto fourth dimensional entrances. Some might have succeeded. And I will rest mycase here, and keep my mouth shut!It was reported in close circles, that a couple living somewhere in the UnitedStates had a nightmarish experience, when the nanny of their two lovely childrenvanished into thin air, in a fraction of a second in their kitchen, whileopening a can of concentrated milk; never to be found again.The military police were called in to investigate. Two days later, the “case wasclosed” and the couple were order to evacuate their home. You have every rightto doubt my words.To an alert mind, these sorts of stories are science fiction. From the bottom ofmy heart, I do not wish to see you in a similar situation, because this couldhappen to all of us. A highly regarded scientist told me once that the disappearance of the nanny wasnever considered a “closed case”. He said that a few hours after this tragic andfrightening experience happened, one parapsychologist and one quantum physicsexpert were taken to the couple’s home to conduct further investigations.They searched the whole house, and after three laborious hours, found theentrance to the fourth dimension, located on the right side of the kitchen sink.They sealed the kitchen area, and encircled the entrance “Door” of thethreatening dimension with colored fiberglass sheets. From these types ofopenings, entities, substances, other life-forms, gravity and reverse-gravitycan also leak into our world from that fourth dimension. 3-Entrance to the parallel dimension:I will not elaborate on this dimension, because I have written on this subjectad infinitum in many of my previous books. But worth mentioning here, is thatparallel dimensions are not the product of fantasy or science fiction. Some ofthe world’s most admired scientists and professors teaching quantum physics havealready explained what a parallel dimension is, and/ or how multiple dimensionswork.According to their most recent findings and theories, there are 11 knownparallel dimensions in the universe. *** *** ***Anunnaki immaturity, emotional control, jealousy, sin? Questions by Reverend Nancy Santos. Question: Have the Anunnaki matured away from their immaturity in emotionalcontrol, past stories of jealousy, power, etc., sin? Answer:On what base(s) or ground, have you created this opinion of yours? How did youknow about Anunnaki’s maturity or immaturity? Jealousy, sin, etc.? The only andvery few authentic and authoritative references (Historical, chronological,linguistic, religious, epistemological, etymological, artistic, archeological,anthropological, and of course cosmological) on the Anunnaki are found in: > • 1- The Akkadian clay tablets texts:The Akkadian clay tablets texts, (Nineveh Library of Ashur-ba-Nipal) whichmillions of readers in the West cannot read. And almost 99% of those who readabout ufology and related topics have based their opinions about the Anunnaki(and also other aliens as well), on personal interpretations of very craftyauthors with fabulous and phantasmagorical theories that defy logic and commonsense.Unless you know Akkadian, Old Babylonian, Ugaritic, Hittite, Assyrian, andPhoenician languages, you cannot form any opinion on the Anunnaki. However, youcan shape a pretty clear idea about the Anunnaki, by reading the works andtranslations of the early Assyriologists and eminent linguists, who decipheredand translated the Akkadian cuneiform tablets in the 19 th and early 20 thcenturies. Unfortunately, very few readers in the West are interested in theseliterary and academic publications, because they are not fun – or so they think!They would rather prefer to read paperback books, and stories by contemporaryauthors who have managed to somehow mesmerize the public with fabulous storiesand extraordinary interpretations, which is why their books have becomebestsellers, whilst the serious and well-researched books on the history andcivilization of Mesopotamia, Babylon, Sumer, Assyria, Chaldea, Akkad, Ugarit,and Anunnaki are largely ignored and forgotten under a heavy layer of dust incollege libraries, and in the archives of rarely visited museums.But I have some good news for you.In many works by archeologists, historians, linguists and museum curators (Fromthe early 1810 to the mid 20 th century), you can find translations of Akkadianand Old Babylonian texts, referring to how and why the Sumerians depicted theAnunnaki as they did. Please read the serious books written by acclaimedscholars, and not the third rate novels, commercial essays, paperbacks, andidiotic blogs on the Internet!!In those translations by academicians and noted historians, you will find plentyof stories about the emotions, feelings, and the way of life of the Anunnaki, asdepicted by Babylonian scribes and writers in the Akkadian language, andproto-Babylonian. These stories encompass all sorts of dramas and soap operas, like gods rapingwomen, Anunnaki Sinhars (Leaders) fighting each other, an Anunnaki god whoplanned the destruction of the human race; Anunnaki goddesses with extreme angerand legendary jealousy, so on. But bear in mind, those Anunnaki stories camefrom the mouth of fabulous story-tellers in Sumer. And this was intentional ontheir part.They wanted to portray the Anunnaki as divine-human, so at least they couldshare some common and similar traits with them. The Greeks did the very samething.Some of their deities were jealous, ferocious, malicious and yes, some wererapists and sexual predators!!Something else you should remember:The Anunnaki who descended to Earth (Sumer, Phoenicia, Turkey) are quitedifferent from the Anunnaki who were, and still are in Nibiru!Earth’s Anunnaki had to look in some way, somehow not very much different fromhumans, otherwise the Babylonians would have not tried to identify and associatetheir legendary kings with the Anunnaki kings. > • 2-The Bible:I will be brief.The Old Testament offered contradicting, convergent and divergent portrayals ofthe Anunnaki, usually referred to as Rephaim, Anakim, Nephilim, B’nai Elohim, soon.Don’t count on these Biblical accounts. The early Hebrew scribes borrowed theirmajor Biblical stories from the myths and religions of Babylon, Ugarit, Amritand Phoenicia.As a matter of fact, Yahweh was Baal-El, the Ugaritic-Phoenician god. And almostall the powerful traits and virtues of Enki and Ea were transferred to theattributes of Jehovah (Yahweh, the god of the Israelites), even Daniel wascopied from the Phoenician myth of Danel (Ugarit).This is a fact.You can read several translations of this myth as well as numerous Ugaritictexts referring to the early prototypes and characteristics of Yahweh found inthe depiction of the Ugaritic deities. Having said that, bear in mind that theBiblical depiction of the Anunnaki in various forms and names is not accurate.In fact, they are hostile, and there are reasons for doing so.Firstly, Abraham and Moses desperately wanted to establish an identity for theirpeople.In ancient times, a nation was usually associated with its deities. If their godwas strong and all mighty, then they become a powerful and rightful nation.If, however, you have a bad/weak god, you end up with a bad/weak nation.Secondly, the early Israelites feared the expansion of the Phoenician cults.They were a direct threat to Yahweh, their own god.The Israelite prophets waged hysterical wars against the gods of Tyre, Sidon,Byblos, Arwad, Ugarit and Amrit.Consequently, they had to assassinate the character of all other gods, andportray Yahweh as the only, the mightiest and most righteous god of all.Therefore, what you have read in the Bible about the sin, the anger, thejealousy, the vices of the Anunnaki, were written by scribes who had to defendtheir own interests, authority, the pride of their nation, their raison d’etre,and the status/importance/legitimacy of their god, and above all, to justify thereasons for conquering the lands of their neighbors, and building their newcities on territories taken away from their legitimate owners.Yes, the Bible is the most colorful propaganda literature in the world.” 3- Phoenician and Anatolian texts and archeological finds:You can learn a lot about the Anunnaki from studying slabs, texts, obelisks andcylinder seals found in Turkey, Arwad, Malta, Cyprus, Ugarit, Amrit, Phoenicia,Armenia (Urartu, Cilicia), Byblos, Batroun, Sidon, Afkah, Amchit and Tyre inLebanon (Ancient Phoenicia). In addition, there are several myths and poems inPhoenician and Ugaritic that tell us about the traits and characteristics of theAnunnaki.Worth mentioning here is that none of these archeological finds indicate whatyou have stated: “Anunnaki immaturity, jealousy, control, etc.” On the contrary,the Anatolian and Phoenician texts and slabs offered us a different picture ofthe Anunnaki, in sharp contrast to the Hebrew depiction of the Anunnaki.Before passing judgment on the Anunnaki, we should first refer to historicalsources, and above all to original texts written in Akkadian/Sumerian,Babylonian and Phoenician.What you read on the Internet (Usually written by ignorant red necks,self-proclaimed channelers and psychics, and people totally unfamiliar withMiddle Eastern and Near Eastern languages) is pure fabrication.Stick to the historical and linguistic facts! *** *** *** The Anunnaki’s God: A critical God? Question by Reverend Nancy Santos. Question: Are the Anunnaki a Critical God?No forgiveness, and no exceptions as in an eye for an eye and a tooth for atooth?Answer:The Anunnaki do not have a God.The God we know (Judeo-Christian-Muslim God) was invented by an Iraqi man calledAbraham (Real name Av-Ram, and he was born in Ur in Mesopotamia, modern dayIraq.) And this God called Yahweh or Jehovah by the Hebrews was in fact areplica of the Anunnaki Ea-Enki lords, and later on embellished with a divinecaricature borrowed from the Ugaritic-Phoenician pagan god Baal, El.The concept of God, or one God was reinforced by Moses; a god he met in thebushes! Quite a rendez-vous!The same God he had a chat with on Mount Sinai, where he received the 10Commandments! The truth I tell you, Yahweh was modeled after the Anunnaki lordswho descended on Iraq, and the Phoenician Baal (Ba’al Hadadd) of Tyre andUgarit.Besides, Moses did not need to go all the way up to the top of the mountain toget his Commandments.They were already available to him in Egypt, while he served as a chief advisorand a military commander to the Pharaoh. The 10 Commandments were in fact 613Commandments. Almost 80% of these Hebraic Commandments were taken from theEgyptian scriptures and the Egyptian Book of the Dead!! Some 50 years ago, German and French archeologists found the Famous “ByblosBuilding Inscriptions” which specifically contained the name of Yahweh as Yaw,and Ya-weh (Phoenician pronunciation) centuries before Moses announced to hispeople the name of their Hebrew God.God was created by Man.However, the Anunnaki have A Maha-Sinhar, also called Gala-Amroot, andBaalshamrout, which means a great lord. He/she is in charge. He is both femaleand male, the creator/creatrice of all intelligent life-forms on Earth.On Nibiru and in the galactic infinity, the Maha-Sinhar is a merciful lord.Her/his wisdom is based upon a complete understanding of Donia (The world; theuniverse). Her/his truth is founded in science; a positive and “friendly”science.“No exceptions as in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth?” as you havestated, is an alarming truth, because it is part of early Man’s literature. Yes,Nancy, you are right this time, if you associate this phrase with the God wehave learned about from the Israelites. Some of the Anunnaki so-called gods who descended to Earth (Sumer/Assyria)displayed anger, vengeance et al, as depicted by scribes on planet Earth. Thisprimordial depiction gave birth to the character, persona and traits of theHebrew God who become the God of the Christians and the Muslims.But…but NOT to the early Gnostic Christians (The Real and first Christians), forthey understood that the Judaic God was a vicious, vengeful and aggressivevillain-god!The Anunnaki’s God on Earth was a “Critical God” as you have correctly stated.The Anunnaki so-called God on Nibiru is just the opposite!This is not a personal attack on Judaism and Christianity and/or Islam. Myfavorite mentors/teachers were Mordachai ben Zvi and N. ben Yacob. I was raisedas a Roman-Catholic and as a Jew. And I have served the Vatican and the Jewishcommunity and media in several roles and capacities.As to my affiliation with Islam, (I am not a Muslim) I have studied the Koranand Arabic literature for more than 55 years, and I have taught Islamicliterature and language for decades, in addition to which I have studied theSharia, the Fukh, and Islamic laws and procedures for a very long time, andappeared before Islamic courts as an attorney at law; a tradition I became veryfond of! *** *** *** Benevolent and malevolent Anunnaki gods Question by Reverend Nancy Santos. Question: Is there a benevolent and a malevolent faction of Anunnaki Gods?Answer:Not in their homeland, and not on their planet!On Earth, yes!And on Earth in ancient times, not today.Ancient stories and inscriptions on clay tablets found in Iraq revealed a greatdeal of violence, aggression, and malevolence of the Anunnaki gods.> • a -The Epic of Gilgamesh,> • b -the Descent of Ishtar to Kurnugi (Hell),> • c -The Enuma Elish,> • d -The exploits of Marduk,> • e -The Akkadian epic of creation,> • f -The story of the fight between Tiamat and Marduk,> • g -The struggle between the Anunnaki lords, Ea, Enki, Anu,> • h -The story of the revolt of the Igigi,> • i -The story of the rape of an Anunnaki goddess by an Anunnaki god/king,> • j -The story of the genetic creation of the first Man by slaughtering an> Igigi god,> • k -The poems and literature of Babylon (Ishtar, Inanna, Eabani, Enkidu,> etc.)All have revealed the good and bad aspects of the Anunnaki gods on Earth, aswritten by the Babylonian scribes. But these stories are pure literature, myths,legends, and tales, and exclusively related to Earth’s Anunnaki. The truth ofthese events can only be found within the manuscripts/scrolls of theAnunnaki-Ulema. *** *** *** Clairvoyance (Telepathic communication/vision) between members of the samefamily Question from his Eminence, Archbishop Frédéric Burcklé von Aarburg. Brussels,Belgium. Question: Y a-t-il une voyance entre les membres d'une meme famille? (Ce quedisent les Mormons). Je pense que nous sommes des récepteurs d'ondes, peut etreplus fortes émanant d'une famille. Mon grand père paternel est décédé au milieud'une haine familiale énorme, la principale raison en était que notre familleétant Alsacienne, mon grand père se trouva du coté de l'occupant, alors que monpère fut dans la résistance.Je résidais à l'époque entre Bruxelles et Amsterdam; Je décidais de faire direune messe pour mon grand père 6 mois après son déces; Bien sur je fis en sortede calculer quel jour je serais présent pour la dite messe à Bruxelles;Il se fit que je ne pouvais etre à Bruxelles le jour de la messe; Le soir j'aitéléphoné à Paris et mon père m'a déclaré: Figure toi que je ne sais pourquoiaujourd'hui mes pas m'ont porté à telle Eglise (il n'allait jamais plus àl'Eglise)à 18heures (heure de la messe prévue à Bruxelles) et j'ai prié etallumé un cierge pour mon père (mon grand père)Il se trouve donc que, ce qui est logique, il fit le devoir que je lui avaitmentalement suggéré (c'est mon interprétation) Translation in brief: Is there clairvoyance (Telepathic communication/vision)between members of the same family? Answer:Science has split interpretations on the subject. However, such telepathiccommunication does occur quite often, especially between siblings and members ofthe same family, who share a strong affectionate bondage.This telepathic phenomenon is usually reinforced in cases, when two members ofthe same family are deeply concerned with onesubject and/or a situation that tie(s) them very closely to each other; suchoccurrences are manifested in cases of death, imminent threat, accentuatedanxiety, fear, a deep concern, and an urgent need to reach other.Clairvoyance rapport and/or mental suggestion can be taught.It is a matter of: a-Rapport:> • 1 -Determination of two persons or more who wish to contact each other,> • 2 -Concentration on the same subject or object,> • 3 - Parties’ agreeing on contacting each other at a specific time,> • 4 -Parties willingness to be patient;> • 5 -One party to act as a recipient (A receiver),> • 6 -Another party to act as an emitter (Sender) of the message.> • 7 -The locale is very important.

Up to a few yearsago, scientists believed in only 7 dimensions.And do not forget that the theorist and eminent scientist who advanced thetheory of the 11 dimensions had been ridiculed by peers for 11 years! Andunfortunately, he also lost one of his teaching positions.But finally and thankfully he has recently been vindicated.Yes sir, they ridiculed him and disgraced him for years!According to the Ulema, there exist far more than 11 dimensions.Steven, I have already answered this question in another section of this book.Never mind, I am glad to give you more information and accommodate yourquestion.Quantum physics pioneers compared the multiple dimensions of the universe(Multiverse) to strings. And quite correctly added, that the universe wascreated by collisions of membranes (M theory). And this collision is continuingas we speak. Thus, they concluded that the universe is expanding. Well, theCatholic priest and scientist, Christian Lemaitre said the very same thing 90years ago.Einstein reviewed his theory and commented: “Your math is correct, but yourphysics are lousy!” Einstein was wrong.Centuries ago, the Ulema have stated (As I have mentioned in my previous books)that the known universe was created by several collisions of bubbles.In 1961, when I reported this to several scientists and some of my colleagues(authors), they laughed at me and at the Ulema! I didn’t mind, because I laughedtoo.There is an enormous difference between traditional science, avant-garde quantumphysics and Ulema science-metaphysics-metalogic. The Ulema views are based uponscience and knowledge gained from the Anunnaki. What they have learned from theAnunnaki Sinhars, remains incomprehensible to most of us. But I can assure youthat a few extraordinary scientists strongly believe in the astronomy andcosmogeny of the Anunnaki, and honestly admitted that our mind is incapable ofunderstanding the Anunnaki’s highly advanced science and technology. TheAnunnaki saw our universe before we were born. And they witnessed the birth ofmany stars, planets and galaxies!According to Ulemite literature, the Anunnaki told the Ulema that there areseveral “Layers” and “Outer-Dimensions” beyond the boundaries of planet Earth.Some are purely mental, others are physical. And even in the “Mental Sphere” youwill find multiple spheres and zones, which are extra or para-mental. Thisapplies also to the physical planes, membranes or branes as coined in quantumphysics.Most recently, quantum physics theorists began to admit that within each andevery separate molecule, each brane, and each universe, there are multipleuniverses. But they don’t know for sure how these intra-universes were createdin one single universe or molecule. Some have advanced the theory, that theinner universe of a global universe (One single molecule) was created by an“Implosion”.Ironically, this is what the Ulema have said centuries ago. We can conclude fromthe statements of the Ulema, that there are zillions of universes and dimensionsbeyond our physical world, and these universes are increasing in number, sizeand mobility. And some are running away from us and from the very fabric of theuniverse.This is very convenient to quantum physics pioneers, because it strengthenstheir theory of “The universe is expanding.” *** *** *** Question : Do other beings exist in these dimensions?Answer:Absolutely. According to quantum physics pioneers and leading theorists in thefield, (led by Dr. Michio Kaku) there are even copies of ourselves in otherworlds. On the Science Channel in the United States, Dr. Kaku stated that insome universes, Elvis Presley is still alive, Napoleon won the war, and you werenever born.I am pleased and relieved that such a fantastic statement came directly from themouth of an eminent and highly respected scientist. Just imagine if I had saidthat to people who hate my guts… how they would react, and how gossipy andvicious would the blogs be, posted on cheap websites on the Internet to ridiculeand discredit me.There is vast literature on this subject, part of it written by eminentscientists, and several other parts produced by New Age ufology writers and“Psychics to the Stars”. Take your pick. Some researchers have reported to me,that at least two governments have already catalogued the different categoriesof aliens and non-alien entities living in different universes. *** *** *** Question : Can we ever contact them, and would there be negative repercussionsfrom doing so?Answer:Dr. Stephen Hawking said: “It would a very bad idea!” P[Image00004.gif] ART 7 UFOsALIENSEXTRATERRESTRIALS "},{"pageContent":"On UFOs___________________________ Did the Anunnaki or any other extraterrestrial race give the Nazis any secretand advanced technology to built UFOs?Did the United States government as we were told capture secret files on GermanUFOs? If yes, is it possible that top secret airplanes like the Aurora were secretlybuilt according to German UFOs blueprints?The Ulema did not answer all these questions. It is very obvious, that thehonorable Ulema are not deeply interested in the UFOs as flying machines,despite the fact that they have plenty of amazing information on the subject ofUFOs, secret military operations and programs on exotic weapons, and especiallyalien technology. I remember what Master Gupa once told me: “UFOs are simply apiece of metal. What we are interested in is the place and role of Man on thegalactic landscape, and the future of humanity.”Briefly, Master Oppenheimer answered one question, and I am herewith reproducinghis answer. However, because the subject of Nazi UFOs has captured theimagination and wild interest of the public, I took the liberty to provide youwith an in-depth research and findings summary on the topic, following theMaster’s reply. Answer of Master Oppenheimer:> 1. The Anunnaki never cooperated with the Nazi on any military project.> 2. In fact, the Anunnaki never returned to Earth.> 3. The Anunnaki are your creators and your makers. They don’t need to> negotiate with the human beings; they don’t interfere in your daily affairs;> they do not influence or control governments; and they do not create wars on> Earth.> 4. The Anunnaki have no interest in communicating with the human race. And for> this reason, people of the Earth should understand that no harm will ever come> from the Anunnaki.> 5. However, they will return to Earth in 2022 to put an end to all the> troubles, the injustice, the cruelty, the violence, the greed and destructive> military and governments’ unjustified acts of war and vicious expansionism.> 6. In part, they feel responsible for the atrocious behavior of the human> race, because they have created the mankind according to their specifications.> 7. These specifications were implanted in your genes, DNA, and “Naphsiya”> (Mind/First source of energy).> 8. Having said that, you should realize by now, that the Anunnaki do not, and> did not encourage any form of violence on Earth.> 9. Military aircrafts are usually designed as a tool of war. Thus, aircrafts,> or UFOs, or any other type of military flying machines are considered tools of> violence, aggression and destruction.> 10. However, there is a non-human race, you may call it extraterrestrial (In> origin) if you wish, that had collaborated with an occult group in Germany,> and provided its leaders with vital information on how to construct formidable> spaceships that defy human logic, and the laws of physics, as understood by> mankind.> 11. This German occult group fell into the hands of some German scientists of> the Third Reich.> 12. German military scientists were provided with blueprints of a very> advanced type of crafts that were produced one year before the end of the> Second World War.> 13. Few prototypes of super aircrafts were manufactured, and flew> successfully.> 14. None of these super aircrafts took part in any military operation during> the war.> 15. However, some were spotted by American and British pilots who had no clues> what these super aircrafts were!> 16.

I am not in liberty to tell you more about this very sensitive and> delicate subject. On the crash of a UFO in Roswell as recorded on the Anunnaki’s Miraya> Did the military capture aliens when the UFO crashed in Roswell? Did the UnitedStates government negotiate a deal with the aliens?Did the Anunnaki know anything about the crash?Did the military find out where the aliens came from?Did the captured aliens die in a military base?If they did not die, where are they now? > • 1. In 1947, a Grays’ spacecraft crashed on an American soil.> • 2. Two Grays died from the impact, but one survived.> • 3. The Americans held him underground at Andrew Air Force Base.

They seemed comfortable,> there was no tension that you would expect in such a company. Then, the sound> came from the Miraya.> • 10. One of the American scientists asked the Gray: “Where did you come from,> and why are you here?”> • 11. “We have been here for thousands of years, sir,” said the Gray, in> perfect English, though his voice had the usual scratchy sound of his race.> “We have our bases underwater, in the Pacific, near Puerto Rico, and under> Alaska’s glaciers.”> 12. The conversation continues: “Thousands of years?”“That is so. We consider ourselves the first and the legitimate inhabitants andowners of the Earth. You are not. We are here because we need natural resourcesthat exist on the surface of the Earth and in the oceans.”“Seems to me this is not all you need, buddy,” said the other scientist,grinning and lighting a cigarette.“This is true. We also need some live organisms, and various substances we canextract from human bodies.”“And did you get all you want?” asked the first scientist.“Yes, by and large. We need them on a constant basis,” said the Gray. “Thenatural resources of the earth and the water are regularly mined. The humansubstances are more difficult to obtain. We get them from the humans we abduct.” Note: The two scientists nodded in agreement, totally unimpressed by the mentionof the abductions. They really did not seem to mind.The conversation continues (As recorded on the Anunnaki’s Miraya):“What bugs me,” said the first scientist, “is that we tried so hard to reverseengineer your spaceship, ever since we got it after the crash in Roswell. Wejust can’t do it.You have to help us decipher the codes on the screens we found inside thespaceship, and also the geometric and scientific symbols on the grids andmeasuring tapes we found scattered around the spaceship. Our team is gettingimpatient; they may even threaten to kill you, you know. The two of us arefriendly with you, but the team is getting ugly, and the boss is mad.”“What is the point?” said the Gray without showing any emotion, not even fearregarding the threat. “Even if I teach you how things work, and decipher all thecodes for you, you will not be able to reverse engineer our technology, becauseyou don’t have the raw materials. Look at this.”From somewhere around his body, he pulled out a piece of metal.“This is a very light metal yet stronger than any material known on earth. Yetthis sheet of metal could float in the air, and can be bent and folded likepaper and then, open up on its own. Look!” He demonstrated. The metal seemed tobe indestructible.“You must understand that we are willing to reveal plenty of information,” saidthe Gray. “But we can only do so if you will allow me to go home. I need torecharge my body, it’s like a battery, you know. I will die if I stay muchlonger, and that will be useless to you. Let me go, and I will arrange forothers to come back with me, others who know much more than I do. I am a simplepilot. I will bring you scientists. We have no intention of hiding thisknowledge from you, on the contrary, we have every reason to cooperate with youand do some joint projects. And we can supply the raw materials and theknowledge of how to turn it all to your advantage.”“So since we are such good friends,” said the second scientist, “tell me, whereexactly is the home you speak of? Since you have lost the spaceship, obviously,we will have to take you there.’”“If I tell you, you will not understand and you will not be able to take methere, since it involves getting through additional dimensions. Our scientistsconstructed our bases’ entries like that, as a precaution against intruders. Butif you take me back to Roswell, exactly where we crashed, I will find my ownway.” “How will you do that?”“Simple,” said the Gray. “When a spacecraft lands on a particular spot,automatically it marks the spot, scans it, and sends data to our mission controlfor identification and location purposes. Thus, we are never lost. If I cancontact my people, they will come for me.”“But if you go away, how do we communicate with you, and find out when theothers are coming?”“In the spacecraft there is a communication device. Let’s go there. I am sure itis functional, because it is really indestructible. I’ll teach you how to useit. We will contact my people from there and tell them about our plan. You willbe there to supervise everything. Bring the boss, too, just in case.”The scientists looked at each other. They seemed rather pleased.“Very well,” said one of them. “We’ll come back for you later tonight, after wetalk to the boss. I am sure he will agree to our plan.”“It will be a feather in his cap,” said the Gray, using an old human expressionunexpectedly. The two scientists burst out laughing. Author’s notes based on records and statements supplied by Ambar Anati, andpublished in the book “Anunnaki Ultimatum’, co-authored by Ilil Arbel.That, was indeed what happened. They took him back to Roswell, and left himthere on the exact spot of the crash. They did not leave the area, though, buthid in a small canteen which was placed at some distance, to watch what wasgoing to happen to the Gray. In a very short time, a spaceship came, landed, andhe went in.The spaceship took off directly and vanished into the sky.The scientists sent the piece of metal which the Gray has demonstrated to amilitary laboratory, and they called one engineer from Lockheed Corporation andanother one from MIT to analyse the piece.Nobody could figure out what it was made of. Still, prior to his departure,apparently the Gray did reveal many secrets of very advanced technology, thatAmerican corporations started developing right away, and began to use ten yearslater.Many of the highly advanced electronic gadgets American consumers used for aquarter of a century came from the Grays.A few years passed. Then, a historic meeting happened. In February 1954,President Dwight Eisenhower went for a week’s vacation to Palm Springs,California.This was a little strange, and many did not quite understand the timing, becausehe just came back from a quail shooting vacation in Georgia. Actually, it wasless than a week before his trip to Palm Springs.Two vacations in a row was not his style, but he went anyway, and arranged tostay there for a week. Now, a president, as you know, is always surrounded byother officials, not to mention body guards; he is never out of sight.But on the night of February 20, the President of the United States disappeared.The press, which somehow was alerted despite all the efforts for secrecy, spreadrumors that he was ill, or that he suddenly died.The president’s people were alarmed, so they called an emergency pressconference, and announced that Eisenhower lost a tooth cap at his dinner, andhad to be rushed to a dentist. To make it more believable, the dentist waspresented to the people. He was invited to a function the next evening, and wasintroduced all around. This, again, was strange.Why would a dentist be invited to such an affair, and why would the President’spersonnel take such care to make him visible to everyone?The military needed a cover-up.President Eisenhower was actually taken to Muroc Airfield, which later wasrenamed Edwards Air Force Base. There, he met with Grays. No president has everdone so before. The delegation of the extraterrestrials consisted of elevenGrays. Six from Zeta Reticuli, and five from earth’s underwater bases. But ofcourse, this was not the last meeting.This marked the beginning of negotiations between the government of UnitedStates and the Grays. So the situation was no longer only in the hands of themilitary, but went much further.How was this meeting arranged, in the first place?According to the Miraya’s records and Sinhar Anati’s statements: It started ayear before the meetings.In 1953, astronomers discovered some large objects that at first were believedto be asteroids, and later proven to be spaceships.They were very large, but since they took a high orbit around the equator, theywere not visible to laymen.Two projects were installed – Project Sigma, created to interpret the Grays’radio communications, and Project Plato, created to establish diplomaticrelationships with the aliens.There were talks about other races that contacted the humans at that time,arguments regarding who the treaties should be signed with, and so on.As a matter of fact, the Nordics, a benevolent race, actually tried to preventthe humans from getting into these evil treaties, and wanted them to dismantletheir nuclear weapons and abandon their road to self destruction, but they werenot listened to.The Nordics wanted the humans to go on a path of spiritual developments, butwhat the humans wanted was military secrets. Because they are so badlycontaminated, they would not even consider a peaceful offer.And the treaty with the Grays was signed. It basically said that the aliens andthe humans will not interfere with each other’s affairs. The humans will keeptheir presence a secret, and they will be allowed to experiment on cows and on alimited number of human abductees. The abductees’ names would be reported to theU.S. government for control, they were not to be harmed, and they should bereturned to their homes after the memory of the events was removed.The Grays as treacherous as they are, did not keep the promise, and extendedtheir experiments without telling the U.S. government. The humans weretreacherous as well. For example, there was the issue of the Gray that hasarranged all that.He came back with the delegation of 1954, and agreed to stay on earth as ahostage of good will, on condition that he would be allowed freedom to go backand forth to recharge himself.This lasted for a year, but soon enough the Americans, having learned a littleabout the vicious plans of the Grays and the excessive number of abductions thatwas not agreed upon, turned back on their word to the hostage and locked him upfor three years. As a result, he developed extreme claustrophobia thateventually killed him.They won’t let him recharge himself.Sinhar Anati said: “The humans are no better than the Grays.” The AnunnakiCouncil said (According to Anati, of course): “There are still good humans outthere, those who are not contaminated, but they usually don’t go into governmentbusiness.”Important note:The Anunnaki’s Miraya also recorded information on the “Grays’ Earth Belt.”Sinhar Anati explained: “The Grays have built an invisible radio plasmic beltaround Earth. They want to isolate Earth from the universe. This belt can expandup or down, and can affect missiles, rockets, or airplanes, and blow them up.This is what happened to various airplanes in Vietnam, and also to humanspacecrafts and space missions.” *** *** *** What are Anunnaki ships and extraterrestrial crafts made of and how do theylook? > • 1.

Definition:The Aliens’ Transcripts (AT) are a collection, a record, a detailed account, ahuge dossier on all the meetings with non-human entities that occurred from 1947to the present. The Aliens’ Transcripts have a paramount military significanceand an enormous national security importance. And I shall not tap into these twoareas. And I honestly appreciate your understanding.The Aliens’ Transcripts contain thousands upon thousands of pages, sketches,illustrations, charts, graphs, communiqués, notes, statistics, secretPresidential orders, addenda, revised, and re-revised and updated addenda oneverything pertaining to encounters and meetings with aliens.AT does not include civilians’ encounters with aliens, abductions or UFOs’sightings. AT are strictly and exclusively transcripts of meetings with aliens,extraterrestrials, and intraterrestrials.And do not expect these transcripts to be declassified. They will never be!Perhaps some of the pages and reports will be made public in 2021, when the“Aliens Protocol” will be released to the general public; another fascinatingdocument on aliens. If you ask an ufologist or a person who pretends to know alot about aliens, or has written a book on flying saucers, he/she will tell you,“I have never heard of the Aliens’ Transcripts! What is this?”Others will rush to say, “It is a hoax!” Imbeciles, (no matter how many PhDsthey have), will tell you, it is a disinformation campaign. And I say to themRubbish! Silly people will tell you, something fishy here. Alert minds andintelligent people might say, “Hey, let’s look into this.” Insiders know whatthe Aliens Transcripts are. Who had or has access to these transcripts?Even 4 star generals could not access these transcripts. President …tried andfailed. Senator…did everything he could to have a glance at AT and he was “sentaway”. Vice President…inquired about AT, and he was told, there is no such thingas Aliens’ Transcripts. A congressional hearing was scheduled to inquire aboutAT and conduct some sort of questioning, deposition and investigation, but 2 twodays later, it was cancelled. Are you getting the picture? Do you have the rightto know everything about the AT? No, not everything. Some, yes!At one time, Dr. Hynek tried to have access to the Transcripts and the Pentagonsaid: NO! But Dr. Werhner von Braun, Dr. Edward Teller, Dr. Oberth, AlbertEinstein, two young German scientists who are still around (They worked withViktor Schauberger), and a young and brilliant scientist (Still alive) whoworked with the late Karl Schapeller, had plenty of time and opportunities to gothrough the files of the Transcripts. In 1948, we heard that Rudolph Schriever joined the scientists’ team, althoughsome colleagues have claimed that Schriever never participated in any project,simply because he died that year in Czechoslovakia. My sources tell me that theywere wrong. Schriever was well, very much alive and kicking. In 1951, AlbertoFenoglio, joined the team. Twenty years later, Dr. Carl Sagan, and a very famousscientist (Still alive) known for his mind-bending theory on galacticcivilizations were added to the roster. How are they structured the Aliens Transcripts?From mid to the end of 1947, the Aliens Transcripts were a straightdocumentation and minutes of meetings with aliens in general; extraterrestrials,and intraterrestrials (The Grays).In 1948, the Air Force and the Pentagon jointly decided to divide theTranscripts into three categories or parts, and as follows:Category one/Part One: The meetings.This category recorded all questions and answers, and what it was decided uponto do or to continue to do during the meetings.The minutes contained all the topics and subjects discussed, the materialstudied, and especially those of a military and scientific nature, names, ranksand titles of people (military and civilians) who were present, followed byrecommendations and brief reports from scientists. Issues, discussions andsubjects on religion, ethics, Earth history, and anthropology were laterincorporated in category three/part three. This decision was made by a two starsgeneral following studies and reports submitted to his office by a committee ofphysicians, psychiatrists, and experts in behavioral sciences, who at the time,were working on esoteric, mind control, and psychosomatic projects and research.Category two/Part Two: The projects.This category refers to research programs, projects, and training sessionsadministered by two offices especially created by the military and The WhiteHouse. In this category, detailed reports on “Progress” were submitted bytrusted military contractors, and added to the Transcripts. On this, my lips aresealed.Category three/Part Three: Addenda & reports.This category gathered and catalogued all sorts of information on aliens’:> • 1-Nature> • 2-Races> • 3-Species> • 4-Origin> • 5-Habitat> • 6-Technology> • 7-Future operations; I can’t talk about this> • 8-Reports from military personnel at all levels on their personal rapports> with aliens who worked with them in military bases> • 9-Study and analysis of the behavior of the aliens> • 10-Habits> • 11-Strengths and weaknesses> • 12-Nutrition> • 13-Reactions in confined places> • 14-Reactions/attitudes under severe weather conditions (Cold and heat)> • 13-Confrontations and heated debates with scientists, the military, and> military guards> • 14-Flights test> • 15-Reverse engineering, so on. Meetings with the Aliens Basic information:It is extremely important to understand the difference between “meetingextraterrestrials”, or “meeting with extraterrestrials”, and encounter withextraterrestrial, and first meeting/encounter with extraterrestrials. Eachoccurrence had different purposes, and happened for very specific reasons. Alsothe nature of the meeting and the nature of the encounter are very different,for some, are terrestrial, and others non-terrestrial.Q: Did any government and/or agency or unit affiliated with a government in theEastern and Western Hemispheres meet with the aliens, the intraterrestrials andthe extraterrestrials?A: Yes!Q: How many times?A: Many times.Q: Where?A: In many places; military bases, in the desert, underwater, around Earth’sorbit, and outer-space.Q: Are these meetings still happening?A: Yes.Q: Who attend or have attended these meetings?A: High echelon/top brass in the military, and the nation’s very bestscientists, codes decipherers and breakers, and “select” linguists working forthe government.In some meetings, members of the clergy (Catholic Church) and a very prominentProtestant preacher were present.Q: What language has been used during these meetings?A: In the first two meetings, very complicated and complex tools/ machines wereused by the aliens to talk to us.They carried with them a special device in a circular metallic box (Voice-box,also called VB); they had two different kinds of boxes on board theirspacecrafts. Later on, the aliens spoke to us in English and Russian, with aperfect accent.In the second meeting, the aliens gave us the Translation Signals Box (TSB),which allowed us to respond to their communications and messages.Later on, the CTF (Transmission Channel), originally “Channel of thetransmissions frequency of aliens” was used.Q: Didn’t they talk to us telepathically?A: Nonsense! On their device, they have the recordings of all the languages anddialects of Earth.Q: Is it true that the aliens have their own language; an articulate language?A: Yes, they do.Q: Does their device contain non-Earth languages?A: No! The device they used to communicate with was especially created/designedfor this purpose. Present at the meetings:> • First meeting: Military, scientists, photographers.> • Second meeting: Same as the first meeting, plus a head of state, clergy,> preacher, psychics, code breakers, linguists, intelligence, national security.> • Following meetings (First 3 or 4): Military, intelligence, national> security, test pilots, propulsion system experts, scientists, pathologists,> astrophysicists, photographers, futurist, laboratory researchers, one person> from the film industry, physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, artists,> illustrators, so on.> • Following meetings (Continuous/Regular): Military, test pilots, scientists,> nuclear physicists, intelligence, national security, photographers, trusted> military contractors, so on.> • Deleted from the attendance roster (Permanently): Futurist, physicians,> pathologists, clergy, psychologists, psychiatrists, preacher, psychics, code> breakers, etc.2.

No protective suits were used.This historical event was not coincidental. It was agreed upon, and the alienstold us where and when they will meet with us.According to notes in the transcripts, Section 9: Addendum 12- Briefing 341-E1,1947, this first encounter/meeting was arranged by an alien who was in thecustody of the Air Force.At the bottom of the page, there is an arrow and a reference made to a certain“Lt. Colonel S…” On the next page, top left, the words or phrase “No outfits”was mentioned. Note: I brought this up, so those who are “closer to the truth” and other decentinsiders will immediately know that I had a close look at the aliens’transcripts.The alien was never detained by the CIA or the NSA, as many haveclaimed. The alien stayed at a military base for approximately 3 months and 4 days, andlater died.Her body was sent to a military hospital. The alien was captured after herspacecraft crashed, for missing to “jump” into the time-space pocket, needed toenter and exit a physical dimension. The three other aliens died on impact. Theone who survived was a female alien-hybrid, although no genital organs werevisible (I will talk about this, later on.)So, apparently, the aliens did something to their spacecraft, so radiationsemitted by their ships would not affect us, or perhaps, they totally eliminatedany radioactive emission.T[Image00208.gif] hese black eyes are in fact lenses. The aliens remove them atwill. They are attached to a gland we do not have in our system. The aliensdon’t have a retina; they see through cells channel in their brain. Three of themajor functions of the lenses are:a)Protection, b)navigation/direction, c)communication.However, in other cases and situations, when aliens do not announce theirarrival or landing, their crafts emit and leave behind radioactive radiations.But the aliens were wearing protective suits. They told us, human germs causethem skin irritations and dermatologic allergy. This is one of the reasons theywear those silver-metallic suits and eyes-protection-screen-glasses. Othersreasons are, anti-gravity inside their ships, protection against G caused bysharp turns and sudden entering-exiting time-space pockets (Speed of light) andfor navigation purposes.The aliens told us to warn our people not to come close to any of theirspacecrafts when they land unannounced (In all cases and other circumstances),because their spacecrafts’ radiations cause temporary loss of memory, nausea,vomiting, severe headaches, temporary paralysis, temporary loss of sight, andsevere skin burns.By the way, they call their spacecrafts “Time-Space machines”, because theydon’t fly, but jump from one time-space pocket to another. Worth mentioninghere, that the Russians upon meeting the aliens for the first time, did wearspecial suits, for protection measures. The suits were manufactured in Tbilisi,Georgia, former state of the Soviet Union, and the suits were stored at KapustinYar. A brief excerpts from the Transcripts.Note: You can read the whole Aliens Transcripts in my book “Trancripts of whatthe Aliens, Extraterrestrials and Intraterrestrials Told Our Governments”.From the Transcripts of 1947, 1948, 1958, 1963, 1971, and Addenda (Plural ofAddendum) of 1947, 1948, 1964, 1974, 1979, 2003, 2007. 1. Aliens cannot constantly breathe oxygen; they will suffocate and die.2. Almost all aliens are claustrophobic. They will be disoriented if they areconfined in a small area for a certain period of time in the same place.3. There are 224 planets that sustain life as we know it.4. Four other galactic species including the Anunnaki and Igigi resemble humansto a certain degree.5. Two governments have a huge dossier cataloguing alien species by category,faculty, intelligence, science, technology, physiognomy, nature, and location oftheir habitat.6. Aliens don’t have genitals; they don’t reproduce sexually.7. Aliens don’t have a digestive system.8. Aliens don’t have a retina.9. Aliens don’t have a centralized nervous system.10. Aliens’ skin is covered with small pores that have multiple functions andpurposes we do not fully understand.11. At the dawn of humanity, several human species had long tail. And the modernhuman beings were genetically created by the Anunnaki.12. An archaic human-reptilian race lived on planet Earth.13. Meteors or other celestial bodies did not kill the dinosaurs. It neverhappened.14. At one time, the Anunnaki had settlements on the Moon and Mars.15. The hybrid race is genetically created by the intraterrestrials.16. There are 4 hybrid generations and three types. One of these generationslives among us.17. The human race is not important to aliens.18. Earth is the dumpster of the universe we know.19. There is no reincarnation. However dead people trapped in the doomed zone(Marash Mawta) can re-appear and re-manifest themselves physically andholographically.20. Ghosts are the projection of a time-space imprints. They are their ownimprints, produced by time-space memory.21. God was invented by the early human beings.This item for reasons I don’t understand was mentioned twice in the Transcripts.22. There is no hell and there is no heaven in the afterlife.23. The Exodus never happened.24. Jesus Christ did not die on the Cross.25. Jesus Christ was not born in Israel, but in Egypt.26. St. Joseph is not the real father of Jesus.27. There is no soul trapped in the human body. This idea was created by thecave man even though he did not understand what soul is. It was his way tocommunicate with the “Divine” and the supernatural. The early Hittites knewthis. And The Anunnaki Ulema told us about the concept of soul in their Kira’at.28. Civilization was not created by the Mesopotamians. It was exported to theirlands by the Anatolians (Plateau of Turkey), and the early inhabitants ofPhoenicia, at a time this land had no name. Later on it was called Leebaan,which means snow-white.Civilization did not start in Mesopotamia, but first in Anatolia (Part Turkey,part ancient Armenia), continued in Phoenicia, and later on bloomed inMesopotamia.This item was mentioned twice in the Transcripts.29. Turkey and the Anatolian Plateau gave birth to the first form ofcivilization on Earth.30. The universe was created from within; an implosion on the inside andcollisions of bubbles on the outside.This item for reasons I don’t understand was mentioned twice in the Transcripts.31. There are multiple dimensions beyond our physical world.And within each layer of dimension, there is a multitude of other forms ofdimensions.32. There are copies of us in other dimensions.33. Planet Earth will cease to exist in 5 billion years, along with the Moon.34. There are “artificial” settlements and tunnels inside the Moon.35. Many regions inside the Moon are filled with life-forms.36. The Grays saved planet Earth from annihilation when they redirect thetrajectory of a huge celestial body heading toward Earth. This happened alreadytwice.37. The Pyramids are 10,900-11,000 year old. And were not built by the Egyptiansor any human race. The stones were teleported. This item for reasons I don’tunderstand was mentioned twice in the Transcripts.38. Earth ax shifted 4 times before.39. Dark matter is what keeps the universe in place and in order, andcontributes to its expansion.This item for reasons I don’t understand was mentioned twice in the Transcripts.40. The shortest distance between A and B is not a straight line, but a benttrajectory between two dots on a parallel plane.41. The universe bends on itself.42. At the very beginning, Earth had the shape of an egg. It was never totallyround.43. The United States is the only country on Earth which has at its disposal a“Vortex Tunnel Weapon System”. The aliens called it the “Vacuum Continuum Path”(VCP).44. A former President of the United States Okayed operations to uncover andinvestigate anything and everything related to aliens’ existence on Earth. Heinformed an intelligence agency to gather everything they could find, here andabroad and create a file (Dossier). And the President specifically informed theagency that he is NOT interested in reading their reports and learning abouttheir findings.He gave the agency carte blanche, with unlimited authority and power. He alsoauthorized the agency to solicit the help of foreign agents, if necessary. Theagency did.Russian operatives and British agents worked for the agency. The agencyrecruited four former British code breakers, who cracked the code of the GermanEnigma Machine at the signals intelligence center at Bletchley Park in England.In fact, two scientists from Poland were the first to unlock the complicatedmechanism of Enigma, and decipher its codes, not the Brits. Alan Turing, was oneof the first British code breakers who joined the agency efforts to learn moreabout aliens symbols and codes. On more than one occasion, the President toldthe head of the agency not to bother him anymore with UFO and aliens stuff. Andhe made it clear to him, that nobody , no other agency, no one, not even the AirForce should know about this. In other words and simply put, they had to reportto nobody, no one! Director of the FBI, Edgar J. Hoover and the military foundout and were pissed off. Later on, when the Pentagon and Air Force becameheavily involved with UFOs, and took over the whole thing, Hoover wrote to themand asked to be permanently informed.President Truman and President Eisenhower were the only two American Presidentswho were vividly interested in the aliens’ question; they took a vital part andplayed a major role in creating a protocol and procedures on how to initiate andconduct investigations, and gather information. Both presidents allocated hugesecret budgets for aliens’ studies and UFOs research. Along with PresidentGeorge Bush, Sr., at the time he was the director of the CIA, Eisenhower andTruman are considered to be the most knowledgeable high officials on mattersrelated to aliens, the Grays in particular, and UFOs.Eisenhower remained extremely interested in aliens, UFOs and extraterrestrialtechnology, and how it could be used militarily. President Truman by the end ofhis presidency lost interest in UFOs and aliens, who once called “SpaceMonkeys”!45. One committee was created to oversee the whole “progress”. It was headed bya 2 star general.Members were:> • Three distinguished scientists,> • A linguist,> • Two code breakers, one from the United States, the other from Great Britain,> • A cryptology expert, in a different capacity than the code> breakers/decipherers,> • A pathologist,> • A Lt. Colonel, transferred either from the Pentagon or the Air force,> • A high-ranking official from an intelligence agency,> • An expert photographer,> • A Captain,> • A typist,> • A civilian whose identity was only known to the 2 star general.A few months later, the panel got bigger and bigger, to include:> • A- An admiral,> • b- An astronomer,> • c- A test-pilot from the Air Force,> • d- A nuclear physicist who worked at Los Alamos,> • e- A noted German scientist,> • f- A highly regarded university professor,> • g- A geologist/botanist who never said a word.This is not the MJ-12 legendary panel, which is unfortunately to ufology andufologists an elaborate scheme, created by three gentlemen, and regrettablyswallowed by an avalanche of honest but ill-informed authors. They were simplyduped!! C’est la vie !46. In the early fifties, a UFO crashed in Mexico, and human bodies’ parts werefound inside the craft.When the military confronted the Grays, they were shocked to hear the Graystelling them that the UFO was not one of theirs. Furthermore, they explained tothe military that not all UFOs come from the same origin. They pointed out thatthe crescent-shape UFOs were piloted by another race which from time to timeenters our space. And there is nothing we can do about it. When a general askedif THEY (Grays) could do something about it, the aliens said NO, because thosespacecrafts are in fact time machines, difficult to spot, pursue and chase.In the Transcripts, this incident was revisited twice, and marked in 3footnotes. Many years later, when another intelligence/security agency wascreated, the incident was brought up, and dissected piece by piece. It wasconcluded that in fact, the Grays were no part of it, and the bodies parts werethose of native Mexicans from the Aztec’s region, not Americans. For a whilethey rested their case. However, three years later, upon the request of aretired general who became a very influential politician/lawmaker, the case wasreopened and re-examined.The conclusions were horrifying, and I am not in liberty to reveal anyinformation about the investigation. But bear in mind, and never forget this:The United States Air Force, the CIA and the other intelligence agency were notaware of what the aliens were doing at that time.It was only in mid 1960, they became fully aware of what was going on, and theyadopted a new policy and protocol in dealing with aliens. And this was doneagainst all odds, and by taking huge risks, for aliens are millions of years ahead of us on all levels, especially technology, science and warfare. Some sortof agreement was discussed to prevent further atrocities.And to a great degree, it was successful. And the Transcripts show that theUFO’s crash in Mexico was totally unrelated to other alleged or assumed UFOs’crashes in the United States, for they were piloted by a different alienrace.This crash was never mentioned in Grudge, the Blue Book, the Condon Report,or in any official report on UFOs.Bear in mind that very sensitive situations and cases, embarrassing sightings,possible UFOs’ crashes and/or landings with “military implications”, andconfrontations with non-human entities (Aliens of any classification) were nevermentioned in any official report on UFOs, and were never brought to theattention of civilian scientists (Astronomers and astrophysicists) who werehired by the government, by order from the “Big Boss”.
