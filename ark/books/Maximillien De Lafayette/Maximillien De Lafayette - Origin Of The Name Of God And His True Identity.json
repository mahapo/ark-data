So is it fair and logical to assume that we are worshiping a \"Pagans' God\" or more precisely an amalgam of mythical gods? You bet! And this is exactly, the delicate, fragile and controversial topic we will be exploring, discussing and explaining in this treatise. Ifyou are fanatically religious and you believe every word in the Bible, and all the stories rabbis, sheiks, Imams, bishops and priests tel1 you, then, do not read this treatise, because it could disturb you, and lead you to believe that it was written to discredit your faith and your beliefs in the Jewish Bible, the Torah, Talmud, the Christian Bible (New Testament), Jesus, the Christian Church, the Koran, and the Prophets. And this is not the case at all. It is not my intention to dishonor your religion or ridicule whatever you believe in. Never, ever! Before you read any part of this treatise, I want to inform you that this publication does not attack any religion. Far from it. My conclusions are based upon linguistic, historical, geographical, and archaeological facts and irrefutable fındings, scrolls and inscriptions written centuries before any organized religion was established on Earth, and the word \"GOD\" was ever pronounced by or known to mankind. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Those who claim that God, his names and role is a matter of semantics are wrong. it is neither a semantic nor a linguistic matter at all. it is not the name per se, nor the language that defınes the nature of God and proves his existence, and by the way why not her existence? Who can explain to me and who can prove to me that God is indeed Masculine and not Feminine? The enormous differences in defıning \"God\" arise when we attempt to explain his origin and nature in English, in French, in Greek, in Latin, in Arabic, or in any other language, according to the teachings, revelations and conceptions of various religious fıgures such as Abraham, Tut-ankh-amoun, Melkart, Moses, Elijah, Noah, Enoch, Jesus, Mohammad, Moses and New Age gurus. So, it is not a matter of differences in names, or how God is written, pronounced, and spelled in different languages, but: a-His true origin. b-Where did he come from? c-What is his real name? d-How and why did Abraham, Moses, early believers, tribes, scribes, prophets, and others unintentionally or willingly change and/or misinterpret God's name or names? e-How many names God had at the time, Abraham, Moses, and other prophets met him? f-In what original language, his name was written? What and how it was written? And how it was translated in Greek, Latin, French, English, Spanish, ete.? g-How did God himselfpronounce his name? h-Who heard God fırst? i-When and where did the term or word \"God\" appear the fırst time in the history of humanity?

Why? j-Any relation to the Anunnaki, the Ancient Gods, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the extraterrestrials? Those are the vital and most important questions we must address and answer, not how to write God in Aramaic, Hebrew, Latin and English! A major problem arises when some religions attach very particular \"specifications\" and attributes to their national gods. For instance, the Arabic word \"Kabir\" (Also in Turkish, Urdu, Persian, ete.) means great, big, majestic. And the Arabic word \"Akbar\" means the greatest, the biggest, the superior. Now, we all know that Muslims call their god: Allah (Allahou) Akbar, meaning: Allah is the greatest, the biggest, the superior. And here is the problem according to Jewish scholars; why did the Muslims call their God, \"The Superior and the Greatest\"? What did the Muslims mean? Is their Allah (God) greater than whom? Superior to whom? Bigger and superior to another god or other gods? Certainly, the Muslims meant that Allah, their God is superior to the God ofthe Jews and the Christians, explained Jewish scholars and theologians. It is very bizarre indeed, because the Jews themselves think the same thing about their own God (Yahweh). According to the Jewish tradition, Y ahweh is the Only God, the True God, above all other gods ! in Exodus 20:2-17, and Deuteronomy 5:6-21, we read what God has said to Moses: \"I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"slavery ...

Enki said to Abraham that he is the only god, the superior god, the greatest god ... the greatest of all ofthem. It seems to me that the Gods are competing against each other. Now, ifyou do not believe that the Anunnaki Enki/Ea was in fact Yahweh, no problem, remove Enki from the picture, get rid of this comparison or reference, and read the Sumerian texts instead. Y ou will fınd EXACTL Y the same words, the same phrases, the same divine description and threats; the same speech Enki/Ea gave in the Sumerian epics!

Apparently, even today, God is still speaking in the same manner to our flamboyant televangelists and broadcasting preachers who drive Porsche and Mercedes. J esus said the same thing ! In the fırst edition of the Aramaic/Syriac-Arabic Biblical text, we read Jesus saying: \"Ana Nour Al Alam ... Wal Hak\", meaning:\" I anı the Light of the Universe ... and the Truth\", and later on, the Church theologians crafted the Holy Trinity concept, and Jesus became the real God of the World; God The Creator, Jesus the son of God, and \"one\" with the Holy Spirit.

Allah's terminology. Y ahweh was a common Phoenician name. 86% of Americans think that \"Allah\" is the god of the Muslims, and \"Allah\" is not the god of the Christians; the Judeo-Christian God, that is. Those 86% are 100% wrong! ! \"Allah\" is an Arabic word; a term meaning the creator ofthe universe and mankind. \"Allah\" also is a Christian word! Really? Of course! Because the word \"Allah\" was used some 656 years before the Prophet Mohammad was bom and before Islam came to life. \"Allah\" is an Arabic word used by Arabs who were NOT Muslims, but Christians who lived in the Arab world, in the Arab Peninsula, in North Africa, in the Near East, and in the Middle East, long longtime before Arabs were converted to Islam, and years and years and years before the birth of Mohammad, and the establishment of the Islamic religion. The word \"Allah\" was used by the Eastem Christian priests, monks, hermits, and in the Christian mass of the Lebanese Maronites, the Egyptian Copts, the Syrian and Iraqi Syriac and Asshurian, the Roum, the Catholic literature and liturgy. Even today, and as we speak, all Christian Arabs (T o name afew: Maronites, Orthodox, Roum, Syriac, Copts, Assyrians, Armenians-Assyrians, Lebanese Armenian Syriac, and additional 13 different Christian denominations) have used and still use \"Allah\" as the one and only word for God. So, \"Allah\" is a Christian Arabic word adopted by the Prophet Mohammad, the Koran, the Islamic religion, and the Muslims worldwide. However, Allah as a term, as a 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"personage ( creator of the universe ), and as a Christian word for the creator of the universe and maker of the human race was not created by the early Christian Arabs either; they took it from the Aramaic word \"Allah\", and from the Phoenician \"El\", \"Baal-El\". And so did the Hebrews and so many other civilizations and religions throughout the centuries. The Jewish-Hebrew­ Judaic-Israelite Jehovah-Yahweh (Yahweh-Elohim) was the Phoenician god \"El\", \"El-Baal\", \"Baal Hadad\", also called Yaw, Yehaw, and Yehi in Phoenician ... and also was the Anunnaki-Sumerian god \"El-Enki or Ea\". The Phoenician \"El\" became \"Eli\" in Aramaic. And Jesus on the cross before relinquishing his last breath, called his heavenly father \"Eli\". On the cross, Jesus said: \"Eloi, Eloi, lamına sabachthani\", or \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani\"; Matthew: \"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani\", that is to say, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" (xxvii, 46). Mark: \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani\", which is being interpreted, \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?\" (xv, 34.) The Hebrews too, used the Phoenician word \"EL\" as \"Eli\". The plural of Eli (in Aramaic and Hebrew) is Elohim (My Gods, my Lords, and my Masters). The Arabs obliged, and the Christian and Muslim Arabs transformed \"El\" into: Elahi, ilahi, Allah. All came from the same ancient origin/source: Phoenician, and later, Aramaic. Historians, theologians and linguists agree. But what many priests, preachers, rabbis and sheiks are hiding from you - and most probably misleading you - is the origin, the primordial name and nature of the true God who became the god of their religion, and who replaced \"El\", the fırst god, early humans came to know, meet, discover, fear and o bey! 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Phoenician source. While it was/is forbidden to pronounce the name of Y ahweh in Judaism -and at least out of religious courtesy in modem J ewish tradition- Y ahweh was a common name in Phoenicia, and especially in Byblos, Batroun, Sidon, Ras Shamra, Nakoura, Tyre, and U garit. And it was written and pronounced in various ways, such as: a-Yehi, b-Yehaw, c-Yehar, d- Yah, e-Yehu. Many Phoenician males were called Yahweh-this, or Yahweh-that. And a few Phoenician kings used Yahweh as part of their fırst names, such as: a-Yehaw-milk, b-Yehar-baal. For instance, in 1929, a 10 th century B.C. inscription on an ancient Phoenician building built by Y ehimilk, king of Byblos was found and contained the following: \"May the assembly of the gods of Byblos, the king of Byblos, and Baal-shamem prolong the life ofYehi-milk ... \" On another fragment ofthe tablet (Or slab), a passage reads as follows: \"I anı Y ehaw-milk, the king of Byblos, the son of Yeh-ar-baal. .. \" Note: The name Yehi-milk is a very old word composed of two parts: a-Yehi, b-Milk, which means king. From the Phoenician word \"Milk\", derived the Arabic and Hebrew word Malik/Malak, which also means king. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Not to confuse Malak with Malaak, which means angel in Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic. Worth mentioning here that the words/names Yaw, Yeuo and Yaw, which gave birth to the word/name Y ahweh were also found on an ancient Phoenician coin in Gaza, made during the Persian Period. The coin had a Phoenician inscription and the image of the Phoenician sea god, then, called Yaw. Numerous historians and archaeologists have argued that the image on the Phoenician coin is indeed the image of the Hebrew Y ahweh. Additional fındings revealed that the word Y ahweh was used and pronounced differently by the Phoenicians throughout the centuries. For instance, Yehi-milk was frequently used in the 10 th century B.C., while Yehaw-milk was used in the 5 th and the 4 th centuries B.C., in various regions of Phoenicia and Syria (The Canaanite Land). Numerous Sumerologists and Assyriologists believe that Yalı (Referring to Yahweh) originated from the Assyro­ Babylonian word \"Ya'u\", which was the name of an Assyrian-Babylonian god, and later in history, the words \"Ya'u\" and \"Yalı\" were written as \"Jah\" in Mesopotamian epics, poems, and myths. While a greater number of linguists and historians argued that \"Ya'u\" was an alternative name and a Mesopotamian pronunciation ofthe Phoenician word \"Yau\" and/or \"Wau\". The Jewish Bible (Old Testament) confırmed that Yahweh was called Baal (Name of a Phoenician god) by some Israelites. From Hosea 2: 16: \"And in that day, says the Lord, you will call me, 'My Husband,' and no longer will you call me, 'My Ba'al.' For I will remove the names of the Ba'als from her mouth, and they shall be mentioned by name no more.\" In conclusion, Yahweh-Elohim, the God of Israel who became the god of the Christians and Muslims, absorbed the names, attributes, descriptions, epithets, and the glorious 20"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"feats of the gods of Mesopotamia and Canaan, who were his rivals, and became the subject and theme oflsrael's prophets hysterical attacks on Phoenicia and Ugarit's gods.

The Israelite Y ahweh is de facto, a recast/replica of Yaw, Bel, Baal of the Phoenician-Ugartic myths, and other Anunnaki gods. Y ahweh was already a holy name used in Canaanite literature, centuries before the Mosaic epoch. Y ahweh is a combination of the traits and attributes of Yaw/Yam/Baal of the Phoenician-Ugaritic Myths (1500- 1200 B.C.) and Babylon's Anuna, thousands ofyears before the Hebraic monotheistic religion was established. The Hebraic scribes and writers ofthe Old Testament fused the Ugaritic El (Bull-El), Yaw and Baal together into the new image of Yahweh-Elohim ofthe Jewish Bible. *** *** *** 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Phoenician words \"Y ehaw\", \"Y ehi\", \"Y aw\", and \"Y euo\" are the origin of the Hebrew words \"Yalı\", \"Yahu\", and \"Yahweh\". The Phoenician name Y ehaw-milk, which was also used as Yehi, Yehaw, and Yehar which meant \"Yehaw is king\", as well as the name of the Phoenician/Canaanite sea-god Y aw or Y euo gave birth to the Hebrew words Y ah, Y ahweh and Yahu. The image of Y aw/Y euo which was found on a ancient coin from Gaza, made during the Persian period of Greek artifact and craftsmanship, was in fact, the first historical image of the Hebrew God, Y ahweh; a god, the Phoenicians worshipped under the name of Yehi-milk (10th century B.C.) and Yehaw-milk (5th/4th century B.C.) As soon as the Israelites destroyed the Canaanites (Syrians and Phoenicians ), they ascribed all the mighty and supematural attributes, powers, and glory of the Canaanite and Mesopotamian gods to their own and newly created \"GOD\" Yahweh. And Yahweh became the one and only true god, not Baal, El, or Bel. And afterward, Christianity and Islam used the same scenario. To the Christians, Jesus became God. And to the Muslims, Allah became the one and only god, not Jesus, Yaw, Yahweh, Baal or Bel. The absolute truth is that the newly created Hebrew god \"Yahweh\" is de facto, an amalgam of the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Hittite, and Canaanite (Syrian and Phoenician) gods and goddesses. Linguists, theologians and historians of religions, easily recognized the new divine persona and attributes given to Y ahweh by the Hebrews, simply by comparing the new Hebrew' s attributions to their god, with 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"the old epithets and attributes of gods Baal Saphon (Baal Hadad), El, Seth, Sopdu, Shamash, Tammuz, Anu, Enki, and Enlil.

Allah has \"99 Asma' Al Lalı Al-Housna\", which means the 99 noble names of Allah, and Yahweh is no exception. *** *** *** Israelites bore the name of the Phoenician god Baal. It is a fact that a considerable number of the early Israelites bore the name of God Baal, as did and still do, people from neighboring countries, and even in Latin America, through out the centuries. Milli ons of Muslims have as a fırst name \"Mohammad\", which is the name of the Prophet Mohammad. In Latin America, the tradition continues to the present day; there are hundreds ofthousands of men who are called Jesus. So, it is not unconceivable that some Israelites bore the name of Phoenician deities such as Baal. Sons of Saul, the fırst king of Israel were called Baal. And as told by Hosea, Y ahweh was also called Baal. But the trend of naming Israelites Baal ceased when Israel waged a war against the U garitic and Phoenicians when the Hebrew prophets and scribes began to feel the direct threat of the Phoenician religion to their Judaism and Hebraic religion, between 1200 and 587 B.C. *** *** *** 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Appearances of the word Y ahweh outside and before the Bible was written (To name a few).

Yaah-wi derived from the Ugaritic and Phoenician word \"h wy \", which also appeared as \"hyw\" in Ethiopian, and as \"hyy\" in Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew, and meant \"be, to be, to become, and to give life.\" However, if could also mean \"to appear, to be present, and to manifest\" taken into consideration the defınition and meaning of the word \"yahwi\" (yaahwi) in Amorite. The two similar sentences in Amorite and archaic Phoenician-Proto Ugaritic \"Yaahwi ilum\" and \"Yahwi ilu\" mean the god who manifests himself. The word \"ilu\" and related elements were concurrently used as \"el\", \"il\", \"eli\", \"Ilum\" (Akkadian), in Phoenician, Ugaritic, Hebrew and even Arabic, since the Arabic words \"Ilahi\" (My god), \"Ilah\" (God) and \"Alaah\" were used in ancient and modem Arabic. Yawi (Ya-wi) is obviously a variant of \"Yaah-wi (Ya-ah­ wi).

This, became evident and unquestionable when the Hebrews used the Hyksos-Ugaritic Bull (Baal-Hadad) as symbol for their escape from Egypt. *** *** *** Y ahweh, and Ea/Enki create a spring in the Garden of Eden: From the Akkadian-Sumerian clay tablets we know that Ea \"Enki\" created a huge fountain (A pond, a lake, a river) in the garden of idin (Eden). The Bible told us that Y ahweh created a spring in the Garden of Eden (The same garden) which gave birth to four ancient rivers, called the Euphrates, the Hiddekel, the Pishon and the Gihon. Numerous Mesopotamian slabs and seals depicted Ea \"Enki\" as an imposing god seated on a high throne with four or fıve streams of water (in the form of rivers) emanating from and/or around his shoulders. üne of the characteristics and attribute of Ea is \"The God of water\", frequently 33"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"associated with \"Apsu\" which means in Sumero-Akkadian, ground-water. Numerous Mesopotamian clay tablets depicted Ea \"Enki\" as a god inhabiting the \"Apsu\", and \"Apsu\" is where he dwells. As such, he is the universal creator, for water was needed to create the world. In the Koran, we fınd a reference made to Allah as the creator of the universe, because he created water. The Koran stated, \"Wa Khalakna Lakoum min Al Ma'I, Koula Chay'en Hay\", which means verbatim, \"And we have created for you from the water each life-form (Or each living creature). In the old-Babylonian epics, water played a paramount and primordial role; water gave birth to the world, and water through the Great Deluge destroyed the world. Unforgettable historical fıgures in the Sumero-Akkadian epics were commonly and frequently associated with water, such as Pir­ napishtim (Also called Utnapishtim, Ziusudra and Atrahasis) who became the Hebrew Noah. In fact, the Hebrew story of the Great Deluge is the same story of the old Babylonian Deluge, which is de facto, the flood ofthe Mesopotamian Euphrates River. *** *** *** 34"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Y ahweh fighting the Dragon. The Mesopotamian clay tablets told us a story of God Marduk who fought and slaughtered Tiamat the dragon, in order to rule over the world. in the Phoenician-Ugaritic story of \"Baal Cycle\", the Phoenician god Baal-Hadad fought the Lotan \"Tannin\" ( dragon), the seven headed serpent-dragon of the sea located at a close proximity to U garit and lsrael. The Phoenician-Ugaritic dragon story was very well-known to the Hebrews who shared their borders with Phoenicia. in the Jewish Bible, Yahweh fought the sea's dragon Leviathan. lsaiah 27:1 \"in that day Jehovah with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.\" Psalm 74:12-14 \"Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth. Thou didst divitle the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.\" The book of Job describes in detail Yahweh's fight and the fire of the dragon. J o b 41 : \"Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook? His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids ofthe morning. Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth. Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and burning rushes. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth forth from his mouth.\" Unquestionably, the Biblical story of Y ahweh fighting the dragon is copied from the \"Baal Cycle\", an Ugaritic story of 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"god Baa-Hadad who fought against Yam. The 13 th century B.C. myth (Story) of the Phoenician god Baal-Hadad told us that he fought his brother Yam, also called Nahar, to dominate Earth and to rule over the whole world, while the Jewish story was written in 586 B.C. (Note: Some historians have claimed that the Biblical story was written between 588 and 1200 B.C.) The Biblical story of the Hebrew God Y ahweh fıghting Baal-Hadad is simply a reproduction of chapter two of the Ugaritic myth ofYaw (Yahweh) fıghting against Baal for the domination of Earth. And the Phoenician dragon mythical story resurfaced once again in the New Testament. Revelation 13: 1 \" ... and he stood upon the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns, and seven heads, and on his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names ofblasphemy.\"-100 CE. Many of the early Israelites saw Y ahweh as a subordinate to the Phoenician god El. And thus, they equated him with Baal, the Canaanite god they worshiped, and whose attributes were given to Yahweh. Yahweh was depicted as a storm-god who ruled over the waters. And Baal too, was a storm-god who conquered and dominated the waters, symbolized by a sea serpent and a sea-dragon. The Psalms described Y ahweh conquering and subduing the waters by destroying Rab and Leviathan the dragons, exactly as did the Phoenician God Baal who conquered the waters and destroyed the \"Tanin \", the sea-dragon. Thus, it is obvious that the Story of Y ahweh fıghting the dragon originated from the Phoenician story ofBaal fıghting the dragon. *** *** *** 36"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"\"The Most High\" epithet. Y ahweh took on the attributes and feats of Sumerian and Phoenician gods. Y ahweh, assimilated the personas and feats of Mesopotamian gods before Y ahwehism was bom. Anunnaki gods and Enki's motifs and attributes appeared in Genesis as Y ahweh-Elohim' s attributes. And later on, Christianity and Islam ascribed the Babylonian Anunna and Enki's motifs and epithets to Christ and Allah. Professor Kramer pointed out the \"Bible's indebtedness to motifs found in Sumerian (Anunnaki's texts) literature ofthe 4th-3rd millenniums B.C. (Canaanite early Bronze Age)\". He noted that \"Enki the \"Crafty God \" is ali ve and well today, his feats and epithets having been ascribed and assimilated to later gods.\" Professor Cohn (Professor Emeritus, University of Sussex, England) stated: \"Y ahweh did not -any more than Baal or Marduk- remain subordinate to the supreme god. It was normal for a people to exalt its patron god to a position of unique dignity, setting him above all other gods. This happened to Yahweh too: he came to be identified with El. A common epithet of El was El yon, meaning \"the Most High.\" in the psalms, Yahweh is likewise called 'the Most High,' and his dominance is as absolute as El's.\" He added \"All in all, the Israelite world-view in the days of the monarchy had much in common with the world views of the Canaanites, the Mesopotamians, even the Egyptians.\" Y ahweh also took on the attributes of Phoenician wives and consorts.

Well, this is not true! In an Egyptian Hymn to the Sun-God, written circa 1,400 B.C., we read that the Sun-God is \"The primordial Being, who himself made himself ... the one and only God ... \" It is very clear that we are reading here a declaration of monotheism. It is documented that monotheism was introduced into Egypt by Amenophis IV, who called God Aton the \"only God, the one, supreme, and only God.\" This was expressed in an Egyptian hymn in praise to God Aton. The hymn was translated and published in \"Breasted's Development of Religion and Thoughts in Ancient Egypt.\" In section 65 of the hymn we read: \"O Sole God, whose powers no others (Other gods) have (Possessed). In section 11 O, we read, \"Thou alone shining in thy form as living Aton.\" In section 120, we read, \"There is no other that knoweth Thee.\" No doubt, the Egyptian Hymn deeply influenced Psalm 104. Refer to \"The Treasury of Ancient Egypt\" by Weigall, published in London in 191 1. Y ahwehism was not the product of divine revelations to Abraham and to Moses while he was wandering in the Sinai Desert, according to 1 Kings 6:1 (Circa 1446 B.C.) Archaeological excavations proved beyond the shadow ofa doubt, that there is no presence ofa Late Bronze Age in the Sinai Desert and at Mount Sinai (Jabal Mousa).
