Ayn means eye, Fasidah means deteriorated, bad, devilish, evil. Therefore, the whole meaning is the evil eye. And what does evil eye mean? It refers to people who are very jealous of you, and who wish you harm because they are envious of you, of your looks, of your success, of your status, of your wealth, etc., so their envy, jealousy and even hatred are “stored” in their eyes, and their eyes can project negative vibes in your direction, capable of causing you severe damages, and in some instances, even death. *** *** *** 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Babies are extremely vulnerable to Ayn Fasidah, this is why parents in the Middle East, Near East, and Central Africa, make their children wear the “Ayn Zarka” around their neck, in a very visible manner.

Ayn Zarka (Blue Eye) is an amulet depicting a blue eye engraved on a piece of jade, ivory, stone, bones, wood, or similar object. It serves as a deterrent, a sort of protection against envy and jealousy. In other words, it is similar to the Ayn Fasidah magical square, but does not contain the spell and magical effect of the Sahiriin and Allamah. Both serve the same purpose, but the Ayn Fasidah square is more powerful, because it protects you from all kinds of people and their negative vibes, regardless of your age.

Kitbah Kirha Magical Square. _________________________ Never hate those who hate you, if you want to win. Hate is self-destructive. There are many ways for dealing with people who hate your guts. The best way is to protect yourself in a peaceful manner. As you already know, hate disorients people’s judgment, and consequently, reasoning with them becomes useless. The Sahiriin use various Kitabaat, spells, and Arwaah séances to cripple their enemies. The Rouhaniyiin use magical writings. And this is exactly what we are going to do. What is Kitbah Kirha? Kitbah Kirha is a magical writing to block or neutralize the effects and results of hatred, that people have expressed towards you. The hate by itself is irrelevant, but in some instances, the results of hateful actions can cause severe damages to your reputation and business. The Sahiriin have found a way NOT to eliminate hate, but to neutralize its effects on you, and on your business. 37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" People who hate you, usually will use anything they can find, any piece of information, gossip, and especially fabricated stories to cause damage to your reputation, business, and survival. They will never stop until they see you on your knees and out of business. My advice to you is not to reciprocate. Instead of spending time, effort and energy to counter their malicious acts, you should continue to produce, to create, and to carry on with your business and projects as usual. But at the same time, and while you are ignoring their campaign of hate, you should immediately block the results of hate’s vibes by strengthening your state of mind, and especially by creating a wall between their hate and its implications on your being and your business.

Burn the photo of Robert Doe, and dispose of the ashes outside your home. The Sahiriin’s method is different; instead of disposing of the ashes, they keep the ashes and mix them with olive oil, and blend them with clay (Or just dirt), and fashion a triangle. Of course, you should add enough clay to get a good triangle. Let the triangle dry, and then break it by stepping on it. I do not recommend this exercise, because it could cause physical damage and pain to Mr. Doe. The Rouhaniyiin do not advocate the use of black magic.

Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra 49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":" Illustration of Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra. _______________________ 50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"I. Introduction: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is one of the most powerful magical writings known to Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. Allamah Bin Thabet Al Ansari said, “It is a double edged sword, because the Taaleb can use it for both good and evil. It is powerful and dangerous placed in the wrong hands. It is a blessing in the hands of the righteous ones.” Well, what he meant is this: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a very effective magical tool to summon and command bad spirits and good spirits. If used with good intentions, the Taaleb’s requests will be answered by good spirits and entities, and guardian angels. They will manifest in the flesh, and grant lots of favors. Now, if the Taaleb summons bad spirits and entities like Ghoolim and Afrit, these malevolent spirits will also manifest in the flesh, and of course will grant the Taaleb many favors, but there is a high price to pay for this. First, “the bad spirits could steal a part of your Nefs, and control it for a very long time. This happens when the Taaleb is a beginner. The Sahiriin masters can control and fully command the bad spirits without risk. But could you?” said the Honorable master Suleiman Tarek bin Ziyad. He added, “Secondly, once your Talaabat are granted, you create an alliance with the Fasidiin and the lower level of Arwaah. This means, that the bad Arwaah will also be entitled to ask you favors in return, such as entering the bodies of other people, usually innocent people and frightened souls (Human souls).” *** *** *** II. What is Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra? Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a magical circle that contains the names of angels and malevolent spirits, the Taaleb can summon and communicate with. It is frequently used by the Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin for multiple purposes, including but not limited to: 51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" a-Asking favors from the angels, all sorts of favors, big and small. b-Removing obstacles that halt or prevent success in business, and relationships. c.-Closing the Madkhal of bad spirits who manage to enter the world of the living. d-Communicating with spirits trapped in the doomed zone. e-Guiding the trapped souls of dead people who cannot get out of the doomed zone. f-Cleansing areas and spots that are causing sickness, diseases and bad luck. The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin believe that there are spots and regions on Earth considered to be unhealthy and unlucky spots. People who live in those areas will never succeed in life, and their health could be seriously damaged. They also believe that on Earth, there are areas that bring good health and good luck to people. And so on. *** *** *** III.

This is an indication of their presence. 10. If you are familiar with the “Triangular Paper”, make use of it. This is an excellent way of communicating with the spirits. I have explained this in my book “How to Summon and Command Spirits, Angels, Demons, Afarit, Djinns” Vol 1 on pages 66, 67, 68. Triangular Paper technique: Note: In some summoning séances, you need a stack of papers to communicate with entities and spirits. I am taking the liberty of including here a synopsis of the “Triangular Paper” technique, taken from the aforesaid book: In some séances, you might need to use papers as Majda. For some reason, sometimes, the entity refuses to talk to you. But you still have another option to make it/her/him converse with you. How to use it. Follow these instructions: a. Fold a piece of paper in the shape of a triangle and place it on the ground (Burqua’h, sand, working zone). No particular place is required. You can even place the triangular paper outside the Burqua’h. It does not matter, really. But keep the paper far from the candle. Avoid fire accidents. Expect to witness a most unusual magical display, because the paper is going to move in all directions, even jump. b. Now, you are going to engage the entity in a dialogue, a sort of “questions and answers” in motion, meaning that the entity will answer your questions by either lifting up the paper, or shaking it one time, twice or several times, as per your request. I am going to explain this phenomenon, because I am very familiar with it. I saw it several times with my own eyes. It is spectacular!! c. Keep in mind you are now conversing with the entity, even though the entity is not talking to you. You tell the entity that you are going to ask it/her/him a few questions. If the 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"answer is yes, ask the entity to shake the paper once. If the answer is no, ask the entity to shake the paper twice. d.

Magical circle of Tasiir Daa-irat moutaba’aa. ___________________ What is Tasiir? Tasiir means to influence others in the Sahiriin’s language. Literarily, it means to impress. It is represented by the magical circle of Tasiir Daa-irat moutaba’aa. Daa-iraat means circles within circles or circumferences within circumferences, referring to the “multiple layers and zones of the mind”, as explained by Allamah Behrooz Khorshiid (Khorsad). Moutaba’aa means continued. Literarily, it means followed by. It refers to the “constant changing of people’s decisions and courses of action,” as explained by Allamah Al Nabati. Tasiir appeared in both Arabic and Persian Rouhaniyaat, but was interpreted differently for unknown reasons. It is usually used in spirits and entities summoning séances. 65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":" Both black magic and white magic made use of the Tasiir Daa-irat moutaba’aa to influence people, and make them do whatever the Saher wishes or requests. It is a very effective magical tool with a double edge. Allamah Al Nabati said verbatim, “It could be used for good or for evil. Everything depends on the intentions and Talabaat of the Taaleb. And everything also depends on who has been summoned. Are they Angels? Demons? Afarit? Or souls trapped in the doomed zone?” In the old days, it was used by the Sahiriin in Baghdad, Mosul, Damascus, and many parts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to influence judges and rulers. Many have claimed they were set free and/or acquitted, because a Saher opened up for them the magical circle of Tasiir. This technique was banned by Prophet Mohammad, and later on by his companions. And Fatwahs were issued against all seers and magicians who have practiced Tasiir. *** *** *** How to use it. Follow these instructions: 1. First prepare your Burqa’h. 2.

You must write his or her name backward, from right to left, otherwise it will not work. 5.

But rarely, do they explain in simple terms, what that energy is! What is made from? How energy is created? How energy could be sensed and directed? How to use it to create a positive environment? How to use energy to block others’ negative thoughts and unhealthy energy? Can we see others’ energy? Can we see our own energy? And, can we measure energy? If pertinent answers and explanations are not given to us, then, kiss goodbye that energy, and all the mambo-jumbo lectures of the spiritual masters and so-called psychics. And, it’s as simple as that. In order to develop the mental power of our mind, we must first, discover the energy of our mind and body. This discovery could be achieved through Ikti-Chafa, which the author has explained at length in the book. All of us possess what others call “supernatural powers.” In fact, there is nothing “supernatural” at all. It is a matter of discovering and understanding how mental vibrations are created and transmitted. The book offers techniques which will enable you to use the power of your mind over matter. It is not an easy task, but it could be done if you practice and persevere. In addition to discovering and animating the power of your mind (Mental energy), you must absolutely understand how Mintaka Difaya works. Mintaka Difaya is related to “Protecting your Zone”, the physical and mental zone that surrounds your body. Without such protection, our mental power will remain minimal.

For the first time ever in the Western world, and in the history of the occult, divination, Tarot, Anunnaki, Ulema, and esoteric studies of all kinds, the reader, the seer, the adept and the novice will have access to the world's most powerful book on the subject. These 7,000 year old secrets, and forbidden knowledge and techniques, for reading the future and changing major events in your life, are being made available for the first time. Lessons, advice, techniques, training and reading your Future and Tarot are directly provided by the last contemporary Ulema Anunnaki who lived consecutively through three centuries. Techniques and lessons include how to discover your lucky hours and days; how to reverse bad luck; learning about your past lives, your present, your future, and your multiple existences on Earth and in other dimensions, how to foresee and avert imminent dangers threatening your life, health, career, business, and relationships. Tarot Anunnaki Ulema Bakht Kiraat is the study and reading of one’s future on Earth and in other dimensions. It regroups the past into the present, and transcends the frontiers of the present to reach the realm of the future. The “Ulema Anunnaki Tarot: Lessons and Techniques to See your Future” is the first published work on foretelling your future day by day, hour by hour. There is no other book written on the subject. Bakht has been practiced by the Ulema Anunnaki for thousands of years. It is totally unknown in the Western hemisphere. Essentially, Tarot Bakht is based upon knowledge received from the early remnants of the Anna.Ki, also called Anu.Na.Ki, an extra-terrestrial race which landed on Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago. Very few seers and mystics outside the circle of the Ulema Anunnaki penetrated the secrets of the Bakht. They were the elite of the priests of Ra, the early Sinhar Khaldi (Early Chaldean priests, astrologers, astronomers), the Tahar (Early Phoenician Purification priests), and the Rouhaniyiin, known in the West as the alchemists/Kabalists. In the whole world today, there are no more 700 persons who practice the Bakht, and they are called Ba-khaat or Bakhaati. Two hundred of them are the supreme enlightened masters, called Mounawariin. The earliest manuscript on Bakht appeared in Phoenicia, circa 7,500 B.C., and it was written in Ana’kh. A later version in Anakh-Proto-Ugaritic appeared three thousand years later. A third version written in the early Phoenician-Byblos script appeared in Byblos and Tyre. The book includes your Tarot Cards Deck.
