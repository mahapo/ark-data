Usually it is of a white color, and ressembles a sticky quasi-liquid substance. In some instances, the ectoplasma takes on the form of a spirit’s materialization.

The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin told us that these objects were teleported by the Djinn or Afarit in the same manner treasures and objects made from gold were teleported to King Solomon.

This word is used when a summoned spirit brings to the séance’s room a variety of objects which are not found in the room. The Saher points out at one particular object; an object he/she is interested in. It could be a piece of paper which usually contains a message written in the Djinn’s script.

The white stone is used for the protection of the Saher or Taaleb. If two black stones are placed on the photograph, a much stronger curse would take effect; in some instances, a terminal illness or even death. To remove the curse, the black stone must be crashed, and soaked in Zaafaran. Hakim: I rule. I have authority. Used by the Sahiriin.

Some Sahiriin, instead of disposing of the ashes, they keep the ashes and mix them with olive oil, and blend them with clay (Or just dirt), and fashion a triangle.

"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" Illustration of Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra. _______________________ I. Introduction:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is one of the most powerful magical writings known to Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. Allamah Bin Thabet Al Ansari said, “It is a double edged sword, because the Taaleb can use it for both good and evil. It is powerful and dangerous placed in the wrong hands. It is a blessing in the hands of the righteous ones.” Well, what he meant is this: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a very effective magical tool to summon and command bad spirits and good spirits. If used with good intentions, the Taaleb’s requests will be answered by good spirits and entities, and guardian angels. They will manifest in the flesh, and grant lots of favors. Now, if the Taaleb summons bad spirits and entities like Ghoolim and Afrit, these malevolent spirits will also manifest in the flesh, and of course will grant the Taaleb many favors, but there is a high price to pay for this. First, “the bad spirits could steal a part of your Nefs, and control it for a very long time. This happens when the Taaleb is a beginner. "},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The Sahiriin masters can control and fully command the bad spirits without risk. But could you?” said the Honorable master Suleiman Tarek bin Ziyad. He added, “Secondly, once your Talaabat are granted, you create an alliance with the Fasidiin and the lower level of Arwaah. This means, that the bad Arwaah will also be entitled to ask you favors in return, such as entering the bodies of other people, usually innocent people and frightened souls (Human souls).” II. What is Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra? Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a magical circle that contains the names of angels and malevolent spirits, the Taaleb can summon and communicate with. It is frequently used by the Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin for multiple purposes, including but not limited to: a-Asking favors from the angels, all sorts of favors, big and small. b-Removing obstacles that halt or prevent success in business, and relationships."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"c.-Closing the Madkhal of bad spirits who manage to enter the world of the living. d-Communicating with spirits trapped in the doomed zone. e-Guiding the trapped souls of dead people who cannot get out of the doomed zone. f-Cleansing areas and spots that are causing sickness, diseases and bad luck. The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin believe that there are spots and regions on Earth considered to be unhealthy and unlucky spots. People who live in those areas will never succeed in life, and their health could be seriously damaged. They also believe that on Earth, there are areas that bring good health and good luck to people. And so on. III. Names of angels mentioned in Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra: a. Jarmihyabeel b.

If you are familiar with the “Triangular Paper”, make use of it. This is an excellent way of communicating with the spirits. I have explained this in my book “How to Summon and Command Spirits, Angels, Demons, Afarit, Djinns” Vol 1 on pages 66, 67, 68. Triangular Paper technique: Note: In some summoning séances, you need a stack of papers to communicate with entities and spirits. I am taking the liberty of including here a synopsis of the “Triangular Paper” technique, taken from the aforesaid book: In some séances, you might need to use papers as Majda.

Expect to witness a most unusual magical display, because the paper is going to move in all directions, even jump. b. Now, you are going to engage the entity in a dialogue, a sort of “questions and answers” in motion, meaning that the entity will answer your questions by either lifting up the paper, or shaking it one time, twice or several times, as per your request. I am going to explain this phenomenon, because I am very familiar with it. I saw it several times with my own eyes. It is spectacular!!"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"c. Keep in mind you are now conversing with the entity, even though the entity is not talking to you. You tell the entity that you are going to ask it/her/him a few questions.

They also believe that on Earth, there are areas that bring good health and good luck to people. And so on.

We can learn a lot from pets and children, just by watching how they react in the presence of these entities, and by taking notes. At the beginning, this would not make sense to many of us, but if we take notes, if we are patient, and we start to compare these notes following several events, our mind will open up, and a part of our “Conduit” will be activated. These entities are not the product of the imagination of a child. They do exist in multiple etheric and even plasmic forms. But our eyes, more precisely our brain is unable to perceive them.

It has the external physical looks of the body you had on earth, but it is transparent, and light like ether. And you are in full control of this new body. 13-You will be able to remember all the places you have visited, all the things you liked and disliked. You will be able to visit any part of the world instantly. 14-You might experience strange feelings, such as falling so fast toward earth or an abyss, or being suspended in air and you don’t know what to do next.

Irresistibly you come closer to your physical body laying there motionless. And a new sensation invades you; you pity this mortal, weak, motionless, insignificant piece of flesh and bones.

The Ulema believe that the soul is one of the many manifestations of the mind, although the soul does not manifest itself in any form or shape, not even in an etheric or ethereal sense.

The distance separating your Double from your physical body depends on your health condition. It is very healthy and even necessary to keep your Double at a close proximity of your body.

Because the physical condition of your body at the time you relinquish your last breath is paramount, the passage to another dimension is henceforth influenced and altered accordingly. For example, people who die in a brutal accident or commit suicide, their Double becomes instantly impaired and dysfunctional at the time of their death. Suicide is wrong.

If you have not caused your own death, but suffered a lot at the time of your death, and your Double was far away from you, your passage to the other world will not be pleasant at all. And the Ba’ab will not be open right away to allow you to enter the other side of the world.

The general meaning is one’s accountability; responsibility at the end of his or her life on Earth. The concept; explanation: This concept was explained during an Ulema’s Kiraat (Readings; lectures), and a Q&A session. During an Ulema’s reading, a student asked the teacher this question: a-What happens to a bad person when he dies and right before he reaches the Ba’ab?

There is no such thing as hell where human flesh and bones are burned by an eternal fire.

His double will stop him right there. He will be punished according to the gravity of his acts and thoughts. This bad person could spend thousands of years in a state of confusion, loneliness, fear, anguish, mental pain and suffering. The mental pain is as real and as atrocious as a physical pain.

But as I see it, this sort of punishment is more painful than burning in fire. Because his Double is partially responsible, the Double will suffer too. Consequently, the deceased bad person will not be united with his Double. The separation between the deceased bad person and his Double will last for many years, as long as it takes to rehabilitate him and purify his past deeds and thoughts. Once the rehabilitation is complete, and the bad person has been totally purified, he"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"unites with his Double and loses his psychological (Psychosomatic) senses of the physical properties of his body. Thus the pain ceases. From the Madkhal he reaches the Ba’ab that takes him to a higher dimension; a sphere of tranquility, beauty, and eternal peace. However, this sphere is not perfect, because it is the lowest of the seven other dimensions that constitute the final and eternal destinations of the human existence. As we progress mentally (Spiritually to others), we reach higher and higher dimensions. The highest sphere we can reach is the Six dimension.

Another student asked the honorable teacher this question: b-What happens to a person who is not bad, but not a very good person when he dies and right before he reaches the Ba’ab? The honorable teacher replied: (Note: Verbatim, word for word. Translated according to the original reading, and preserving its authentic caché.) At the moment of death, he will be guided by his Double to a neutral sphere”where he will spend 40 days of purification. During those 40 days, he will receive guidance and orientation from his “Double”.

Also, he will be permitted to hover over places he wishes to visit for the last time. In some instances, the visited parents of the deceased feel his last apparition to them. Usually, the deceased appears to them in an ethereal form. It is not totally ectoplasmic, because at that stage, the deceased has already lost all the physical properties of his body. So his apparition is mental holography. The apparition does not last long. It fades way within a few seconds. And this is the last message (Sort of a Farewell), the parents will receive from him/her. After that last visit, no contact will ever occur again between the dead person and his/her loved ones. His/her mind (Soul to others) will leave earth for ever.

On the last day of the 40 days period, the deceased is zoomed into his/her Double, and becomes one with his “Original Form”. The Original Form is what it created him/her. This is why we call it Double. The Double is the real persona of the human being. Everything we have in our body and mind came from our Double.

And because the mind of the deceased in this dimension is capable of mental and spatial dilatation, quite often, the mind and the perimeter of the fourth dimension extend like an echo. It is through the extension of that echo, that contacts with the fourth dimension’s inhabitants are possible, but they are so rare. Almost, they never happen.

Such a miracle is assumed to be performed either by God himself, by one of his angels, or by Elijah the Prophet.

These people performed what amounts to magic, despite the fact that Judaism had always objected to any form of it; the Bible even recommends killing all witches. But this did not stop the practitioners of practical Kabbalah from being wonder makers. The baalei shem maintained that they had secret knowledge of the holy Names, and that they could achieve supernatural results using them. The Name, holy Name, or Shem Tov (good Name) may be one of the divine Names, the name of an angel, or a combination of letters in those Names. Most people familiar with Judaism know the name of the Baal Shem Tov , the founder of the Hasidism. His real name was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer. A truly great scholar, he created a new philosophy, functioned as a religious leader, and performed miracles as a wonder-maker. Most of what we know about him is second hand, stories told by his disciples and later repeated for generations, much like Rabbi Hillel, Buddha ,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Socrates, and Jesus . The most famous book about him is Shivhei ha-Besht (Besht is the Hebrew acronym for Baal Shem Tov), a collection of stories that have been used in every book written about him. However, many people do not know that he was not the first to be the master of Names. Many of the stories in the book were borrowed from original tales about other \"baalei shem\" that had preceded the Baal Shem Tov. Scholars, particularly Gershom Scholem, proved that there was no difference between the words \"baal shem\" which means, \"master of the name\" and \"Baal Shem Tov,\" which means \"master of the good name.\" All names were good -- the baalei shem would not use them otherwise. They never performed anything even remotely negative like sorcery, black magic, or Satanism; the entire purpose of the wonders they performed was positive, and based on deep faith in traditional Judaism. The Names they used could be either spoken, or written on amulets made of paper or parchment."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Baalei shem are not mentioned in the Bible. They appear for the first time in the post-Talmudic period in Babylonia, or possibly at the beginning of the Geonim period, and the tales developed into the Middle Ages. The 16th and 17th centuries are extremely rich in stories, in both Israel and Europe. Kefitzat ha- Derekh is only one of the many wonders the “Baalei Shem” performed. They could preserve the bodies of the dead as \"dead-alive\" by placing written amulets in the bodies, to keep them for burial in the proper time and place. They could create golems exorcize demons and dybbuks protect people against their enemies on both land and sea, summon beasts from the spiritual realms, send and interpret dreams, and raise the spirits of the dead. Every process had its own formula and name, and those of kefitzat ha-derekh were different from all the others.

It described how a famous baal shem was seen in one place on the Eve on Sabbath (Friday). Later on the same Friday night, he was seen in another place, a distance of a few days journey.

In his response, Rabbi Hai Gaon categorically denied the possibility of kefitzat ha-derekh; most rational rabbis did not want anything to do with these fanciful ideas.However, the population, greatly encouraged by the baalei shem, did believe in kefitzat ha- derekh. The concept appeared in many areas of the world. Southern Italy produced a particularly famous manuscript, Megillat Ahimaaz (also called Megillat Yuhasin). In this tale a most amusing use of the formula is described -- the Name was written on the hooves of the horse carrying the baal"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"shem! There are tales from Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, and others. Many more are attributed to the Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria), the great kabbalist from Safed, Israel, and to his student, Rabbi Hayim Vital. These wonderful tales continued to develop until the traveling rabbis abandoned walking and riding in favor of technological progress; they started using fast ways of transportation, such as trains, to reach important destinations. As miraculous teleportation was no longer urgently needed, the telling of Kefitzat ha-derekh tales dwindled and eventually stopped. The demise of this myth is surprising, since there are such things as derailed trains, car accidents, and delayed planes. Why not have a miracle in a crowded airport, or while stranded on a lonely road in a stalled car?

The Ulema after years of study and practice, and following the instructions of the Book of Rama- Dosh, became capable of creating a sphere (Or zone) around them that resembles a halo. Some call this halo a “Bubble”. The halo surrounds their physical body. In the halo, exist molecules and particles charged with high atomic and sub-atomic density (No, not nuclear devices!), i.e. energy. This energy is denser in its composition than any of the molecules and particles that physically create and constitute any physical action or movement against an Ulema’s body. "},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Ulema’s energy changes constantly and transmutes itself into higher or lower molecules/particles density, according to their surroundings and needs.Because of the Ulema’s denser atomic substance, nothing can penetrate the halo surrounding them. You have to remember, that everything in the universe is composed from molecules and particles. For instance, if you throw a punch at an Ulema, you put in your punch a certain amount of energy and physical effort. The energy and the physical effort are composed from molecules. These molecules are denser in their composition than the molecules floating around the Ulema, and thus cannot penetrate their halo and reach their bodies. This is why people can’t go through walls. Our bodies molecules need “to shrink” and “transmute” themselves into thinner vibrations, to allow us to go through walls. Secondly, the non-physical entity (Double) you have mentioned is not totally non-physical. It changes."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"It materializes and dematerializes.

Let’s forget for a moment this complicated language, and explore an easier characteristic aspect of the Double, its halo, zone and protective shield. I will try to use a simple language, as much as I can. Disregard everything I have said before, and follow me now step by step. a-Your Double is extremely intelligent and alert, and it senses things around you.
