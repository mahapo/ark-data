It is extremely important and paramount to understand that in this context, we are exclusively referring to old spirits (Arwaah) and entities which existed and still exist in the archaic spiritist realm of the ancient world of the Middle/Near East, Pre-Islam, and Islam.

Those Arwaah and entities could be summoned only if they are contacted in their ancient languages, some of which were written down and preserved in Arabic and Sahiriin texts, and shrouded in secrey for centuries. However, our departed relatives, parents, friends and even pets could be contacted, and/or reached without using any of the Sahiriin’s languages. It is verly logical, since our departed ones did not speak the archaic languages of the Arwaah of the ancient world. If your departed ones spoke English, French or Spanish for instance, you can contact them in any of these languages, as long as they did not traverse yet the “40 Day Period” after they passed away.

In other words, if you want to contact John Doe who spoke English, in English, go ahead without hesitation, because you are using a language he perfectly understands. You can’t contact him in a language he is not familiar with. Remember there are no foreign languages schools and tapes for learning a foreign language in the afterlife. If you want to contact Mr. Ahmad X or Y, who spoke only Arabic, then you must try to reach him in Arabic. And if you want to contact an ancient spirit from Babylon or Sidon, then you must communicate with that spirit in Babylonian or Phoenician. And if you want to contact a Djinn or an Afarit, then you must contact them in one of their own languages which we have included in this book.

You must use one of their archaic languages, for they don’t understand English or Spanish. The same criteria and prerequisite s apply to angels and demons. All spirits and entities, including angels and demons have very precise languages, and very particular words, phrases, Istijabaat, Talaabat and commands. It is very amusing and entertaining –to me- to hear so many mediums telling their customers that they were able to talk to angels and ancient souls in English, and to hear their messages by simply using telepathy and sensing their vibrational presense.

They love to play tricks on us, and quite often they give us wrong information, intentionally. c -Those who are trapped in the doomed zone are angry, confused, and vengeful. Consequently, their language is aggressive and confusing. d -The noble spirits of antiquity speak in Ana’kh, Ulemite, and/or in any ancient language from the Middle and the Near East.

Note: The spirits also use short sentences in answering Taaleb’s questions and requests. And in many instances, they answer by yes or no. In certain cases, they reply by moving objects in different directions, depending on the demands, requests and commands of the Taaleb; this happens, when the spirits and entities do not manifest themselves physically. *** *** *** Names of the 16 languages of lightworkers of Sihr, entities, spirits, and angels: 1-Nouriin: The language of the angels.

You don’t need elaborate expressions and an extensive vocabulary to communicate with spirits and entities if you learn the Sahiriin language. And you will be able to learn the Sahiriin language in no time. Basically, it was developed by the Sahiriin (Masters of Sih’r “Magic” and witchcraft) who lived in Persia, Anatolia, the Arab Peninsula, Palestine-Israel, North Africa, and Medieval Europe; the spirits and entities do not speak English, French or any other language, except their own. Worth mentioning here that the spirits and entities we are referring to are NOT the deceased people and departed loved ones who lived with us on Earth, or the angels you read about in the Bible, and Holy Scriptures. The entities described in several parts of this book are totally different from deceased people, Muslim, Christian or Jewish celestial beings, and messengers."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"And because they are so different from us, they do not understand our languages, nor do they obey to commands given in a language made by humans. *** *** *** Origin of the Sahiriin language: The Sahiriin language contains words, terms, names and phrases written in the archaic Arwaah (Spirits) language. It is Not a human language. Although, numerous Sahiriin words appeared in Kabala, in the Testament of Solomon, in the secret ritual séances of Melkart, in the ancient Arabic, pre-dating Islam, in the Sufism literature, the Dervish’s chants, and other black magic chants and spells, they should not be considered as of an Earth’s origin, or derivations from ancient Near Eastern and Middle Eastern terminology. *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":" Why should I learn the language of the old spirits?

You have to remember that you can communicate with old spirits ad infinitum, because they live simultaneously in multiple dimensions, and there is no time limit for contacting them, as it is the case with our departed loved ones, and other human souls who can be reached only, during the 40 day period following their death and right before they cross over, and those who are trapped in the Bilaya zone and Marash Mawta (Doomed Zone). 2-Communication with old spirits in their particular languages facilitates the process of granting and receiving extraordinary favors. *** *** *** Do we need to learn the languages of the old"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"spirits (of any dimension) to be able to communicate with our departed ones? Answer: No. And what if we wish to contact human “souls” or spirits who don’t speak our language? Answer: It is tricky, because human “souls” or spirits do not learn foreign languages in the afterlife during the 40 day period following their death and right before they cross over to a higher dimension, and in the Doomed Zone. Consequently, the presence of a translator or an interpreter becomes necessary. The Sahiriin call the translator “Mitarjam”, who is usually a spiritual master. It is derived from the Arabic word “Moutarjem”. Summoning spirits: You have to keep in mind, that no one, nobody on Earth can summon the spirit or the soul of a dead person. “Maat...Maat L’il Abd”, meaning “Once dead, is dead for good and for ever...” said word for"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"word, the Honorable Allamah Saleh Sharif Al Kuraychi Al Ansari. He meant that, we, the human beings who are still alive CANNOT contact the dead, and we will never be able to do so, because humans live in a physical zone, while the dead live in another zone, far beyond our reach. In other words, dead people are unreachable, once they cross the bridge of life, and enter another dimension that follows our third dimension; once the 40 day period following their death has expired. So, all those who claim to be able to communicate with the dead are fooling us. However, the Allamah, and some of you, who have assimilated the messages and techniques of the Allamah --which are explained in this book in utmost simplicity-- will be able to reach spirits and entities who did not yet depart from the doomed zone. They are still alive, but they do exist in a different form. And these entities include the spirits of dead people (Human beings) who are still trapped in the doomed zone."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Some of them have stayed in this macabre and disturbing zone for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Other entities were never dead; they were created from formulae and genetic experiments, our mind will never understand or accept. Yet, they do exist. You will be able to communicate with some of these entities, summon them, ask them favors, and even command them. But who are these entities, if they are not the souls of the departed ones, the souls of dear friends, siblings, parents, and relatives, we once had, here, on Earth? These entities are divided into two groups or classes: 1-Class one, called Moo-Aa-Zabeen: Can we communicate with them? Yes, we can. Moo-Aa-Zabeen live in Marach-mawta (The doomed zone). Moo-Aa-Zabeen means those who are suffering. It derived from the Ulemite word “Azaab”, which"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"means pain, suffering. Azaab exists in the Arabic language, and means the very same thing. The Moo-Aa-Zabeen suffer because their souls, or spirits (Anunnaki-Ulema use the word Mind) are trapped in the doomed zone, and can’t get out. The Sahiriin do not considered them as “Fully Dead”. Thus, we can communicate with them, and summon some, using techniques and summons as provided by the Sahiriin. Moo-Aa-Zabeen were once humans. Do not confuse “Noufous” with Moo-Aa-Zabeen. Noufous is the plural of “Nafs”, which means “Soul” of dead people. Nafs or Nafsiya in Arabic. Nefesh in Hebrew. Those Noufous do not live in the doomed zone, but in the world beyond, the realm of souls (Human souls). We cannot communicate with the Noufous, and therefore, we cannot summon them. 2-Class two, called Haadeeraat, and sometimes, Arwaah: Can we communicate with them? Yes, we can. Haadeeraat, and Arwaah live here on"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Earth, as well as in multiple layers of non-physical dimensions, incomprehensible to many of us. Haadeeraat means “Presences”; presences of all sorts, kinds and forms of apparitions and manifestations, such as: Ezraelim Gaffarim Djinns (Jinns. Always in the plural form) Afarit (Plural of Afrit) Ashbah (Plural of Shabah) Apkallu Gallas Angels Demons Ghoolim Helama-Gooliim Arwaah is the plural of “Rouh”, which means spirit or soul. Rouh in Arabic and Roach in Hebrew. Arwaah encompasses all kinds and categories of souls and spirits we can summon. But basically, the word Arwaah refers to the souls of angels,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"demons and afarit. Can we befriend Arwaah and spirits? Absolutely! The Sahiriin have provided us with a list of friendly Arwaah and spirits. They called them: a-Moustajabiin (Those who respond) b-Al Muhibiin (The affectionate ones) Any hostile and dangerous Arwaah and spirits out there? You bet! Plenty! And they are called Shirririin. The Shirririin are divided into four categories: a-Kaabihiin: It is derived from the word “Kaabeeh”, which means bad, bad deed, awful action and awful thoughts.

As soon as the spirit departs, you burn the Burqua’h, and you dispose of it outside your home."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" A’atee: Give (As an order or a command). A very common word used by a Taaleb during a séance, and addressed to an entity, except the category of angels, for angels can’t be ordered by humans. The angels are considered by Sahiriin as superior to human beings, and a category placed between God and the “Rank of Humans.” A’atee is used, when the Saher (Sorcerer) or the practitioner commands an entity to grant any kind of favors, a temporary relief, or make things happen. A’shasha: A screen. In some particular séances, A’shasha was used as a Sihr’s tool to project physical manifestation of summoned spirits. The screen is a quasi-holographic projection which makes entities materialize their essence during a séance. In the Western Hemisphere, and especially in the United States and Great Britain, spirits’ physical manifestation is commonly called ectoplasma by some practitioners. In the East, the Sahiriin refer to a spirit’s physical manifestation as Houdoor,"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"which means presence in the flesh. Evidently, we are talking here about the physical presence of a Djinn or an Afrit, and not the body of a dead human being. And this defines the thin line between real manifestation of an entity and a hoax. No medium on the planet can bring back to life or to a séance, the body of a dead person, not even partially. Only the essence or substance of a higher entity can materialize itself in the flesh, when summoned by a highly experienced practitioner. A’shasha kahraba: Shasha Kahraba’iya in Arabic. An electrical screen, composed from two words: a-A’shasha, which means a screen, b-kahraba, which means electricity. An electrical screen means a monitor, a terminal, a TV screen, so on. Numerous spirits and entities will always try to reach us and communicate with us, using electricity. In the afterlife, including the 40 day period after death, the soul or spirit of the deceased is transmuted into an energy substance"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"very similar to electricity. It is through this “electricity”, a spirit would attempt to return to earth, and manifest itself, even for a very short moment. As long as the “intensity of the electricity” of the spirit is high to a certain degree, the spirit’s manifestation could last up to 10 seconds. When the spirit runs out of energy, it dissipates suddenly. Some Eastern practitioners compared it to an instrument which runs on batteries, such as a flashlight. When the batteries are fully charged, the light’s projection is quite intense. When the batteries began to weaken, the light becomes dimmer and weaker. The spirit of the decease functions on the same principle. Nor the Saher or the Taaleb can recharge the “Batteries” of the manifested spirit (soul) of a dead person, when it starts to weaken, and consequently, the spirit departs suddenly. However on A’shasha kahraba (TV’s screen for"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"instance), the spirit could last much longer, for it recharges itself via electricity. Some of the Ulema and Sahiriin’s techniques could/would allow the practitioner to communicate with spirits via their electronic gadgets, television sets, and computers’ screens. Aabaad: Syriac / Assyrian/Akkadian/Aramaic/Chaldean. Noun. Eternity. Aabaad is usually used as Ila Al Abad, which means to the very end, or permanently. However, Aabaad can’t be used in séances involving bad spirits, spirits from a lower sphere, and malevolent entities. According to the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin,”Abadi” which derived from Aabaad is one of the holy names of God, and means God the eternal.

Aajara: Disease. wa: And. karsih: Cripple. hou: Him.

If the entity is hesitant or reluctant to do so, this would be an indication that the entity in question belongs to a lower level of spirits. In this case, practitioners of white magic usually terminate their Sihr work and immediately dispose of said entity.

This “unannounced visit” occurs when the intruders manage to squeeze in, because the practitioner failed to secure and close the zone of his Sihr’s work. 2-Intruders are notorious for disrupting order and causing a total chaos during a séance. Thus, it is paramount to know what kind of spirits we are dealing with. In this case, the word Aha should be used and not Aaref hidratoom.

Tay Al Ard is essentially a metaphysical experience that produces a teleportation phenomenon; a secret esoteric practice of the Sihr of Ulema and Allamah. When Islam became a major religion in the Near East, and the Middle East, Tay Al Ard was banned by Prophet Muhammad, who called its practitioners “Min Ahl Al Nar”, meaning verbatim: Those who are from fire. Fire meant hell, or the kingdom of Al Shaytan (Satan, the devil). The Arabic pre-Islamic word Ulema was replaced by the Arabic Islamic word Allamah or Ulema’ah. However, the Ulema and the Allamah were very different from each other in many ways. The Ulema remained the custodians of the Anunnaki’s secret knowledge and esoteric powers, while the Allamah were considered as the “Alamin”, the learned ones and leading figures of letters, literature, science and religion.

And both words came to mean or express the same thing – in the eye of Arab scholars – in the Islamic and Arab world. Many Soufiyyin (Sufis) by joining the Ulema learned some of the secrets of Tay Al-Ard. They called it: “Tay Al Makan”, meaning the folding of space. It is composed of two Arabic words: a -Tay, which means folding or to fold; b -Al Makan, which means a space, a location. The Sufis replaced the word Al Makan with the word Al Ard.

Al Munawarin claim that instead of physically moving from one place to another, an enlightened person can bring to himself, to where he is standing, the place he wanted to reach. In other words, the earth of the place to reach has been displaced under the enlightened one’s feet. Ironically, this pre-Islamic concept is now fully accepted by Muslim clerks, Cheiks and teachers of the Islamic Shari’a and Fuk’h, grouped together under the umbrella of Al Allamah. Ulema Qadhi, previously one of the leading figures of Allameh Tabatabaei explained Tay Al Ard as the termination of matter itself in the original location, and its re-appearance, manifestation, and re-creation in its final location, the place one wished to reach. The Iranian Dehkhoda dictionary defined Tay Al Ard as: “An aspect of Keramat “Kiramat” (Extraordinary deeds of saints and holy people) in which instead of going toward a destination by taking a step forward, the earth turns itself toward the traverser rapidly, in a blink of an eye,"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"regardless of how far the destination is.\" Ulema Ibn Al Nadim bin Ishaq al-Nadim (a.k.a. Al Warrak died on September 17, 995. He wrote the Kitab al-Fihrist) explained this phenomenon by citing verses from the Quran, taken from Chapter Al Naml; Verse: 27:38: Solomon said to his men: “O Chiefs, which of you can bring me the throne of Queen of Sheba before she and her envoys come to me in submission?” Verse 27: 39: \"Said an 'Ifrit of Al Jinns: “I will bring it to thee before thou rise from thy council. In fact, I have full power for this purpose, and may be trusted.” Verse 27:40: “Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I will bring it to thee within a blink of any eye!” Then when the sage Solomon saw it placed right before him, he said: “This was done by the authority of God all mighty, my Lord.” Some Middle Eastern sages and teachers of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"religious esoteric dogmas suggested that according to these verses, the Ulema Asif ibn Al Birkhia teleported the throne of Queen Sheba almost instantaneously, in a blink of an eye. This was confirmed in a Hadith (Dialogue, a chat, or a discourse) by Jaafar Al Sadiq. Esoteric Allamah explained this teleportation phenomenon very differently. They claimed that the teleportation occurred because Ulema Asif ibn Birkhia used one of the secret “Asma Al Allah Al Sab’a Al Husma.” (One of the seven secret names of God.) The knowledge and use of one of the secret holy and lovely names of God allowed Ulema Asif ibn Birkhia to teleport the throne. The Ulema, students of the Anunnaki, briefly explained this phenomenon. Ulema Cheik Al Kabir said (Verbatim): “Time is represented with 2 lines not perfectly aligned; one for you, the other for what is not you. Space is represented with two circles; one for you, the other for what is not you. If you manage to place yourself between one of the"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"two lines and one of the two circles without touching the other line and the other circle, you will conquer time-space.” Basically, Tay Al Ard means folding the space: The phenomenon was explained to me by my mentor the Honorable Anunnaki Ulema Rabbi Mordachai. Here is an excerpt from a dialogue on the subject, I had with my mentor and tutor, years ago in Budapest, Hungary. -“Tay Al Ard,” said the Master, “is the metaphysical experience that produces a teleportation phenomenon.” -“Would I be able to do it?” I asked. I envisioned myself hopping at will to every corner of the earth, not even bothering to pack. -Rabbi Mordachai: “Perhaps some day. It is extremely complicated and sometimes even dangerous. For the moment, I just want you to understand the concept.” “Were did the teachings come from?”"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"-Rabbi Mordachai: “The Ulema learned it from Rou-hi-yin, who are supreme beings that dwell in the fifth dimension. For many years, they practiced peacefully all over the world. When Islam came to the Middle East, the Prophet Muhammad banned Tay Al Ard, and many of the Ulema teachers became Allamah, prominent figures in letters, literature, science, and religion. However, not all of them renounced their Ulema identity. Those who chose to remain Ulema, remained the custodians of the Anunnakis’ secret knowledge and esoteric powers. They joined the circle of Non-Muslim Ulema and the groups shared their knowledge. This was common particularly among the Sufis.” -“What do the words Tay Al Ard mean?” I asked. -Rabbi Mordachai: “The words mean ‘the folding of space.’ To put it simply, you traverse the earth without moving. Instead of physically moving from one place to another, the enlightened persons do the exact opposite. They bring the place they want to reach to where they stand. The very earth of the place that they wanted to reach actually moves, and"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"is placed under their feet.” -“Can you see the earth as it moves?” -Rabbi Mordachai: “Never. It happens in a blink of an eye, no matter how far the destination is.” -“And only the Ulema know how to do it, Master?” -Rabbi Mordachai: “That depends how you look at it. Under other names, the phenomenon manifests itself in many other cultures. But some say that all of the great people who practiced Tay Al Ard, such as the great king Solomon from Judea, were secret Ulema anyway. It is well known that King Solomon moved the throne of the Queen of Sheba to his own palace so that she would feel at home during her visit with him. The event was recorded by both Islamic and Jewish teachings.” -“Are there any scientific explanations as to how it works?” I asked. The Master smiled. He saw I was already going in the right direction, and it pleased him. -Rabbi Mordachai: “This is a very good question,” He said. “It was once well put by the Ulema Cheik Al Kabir. His exact words were: Time is represented with two lines not perfectly aligned;"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"one for you, the other for what is not you. Space is represented with two circles, one for you, the other for what is not you.

It goes straight from yesterday to tomorrow, through today, in one line.” -Rabbi Mordachai: “That is what most people think, but they are wrong, and great thinkers understand the malleability of time and space. Sufis, Gnostics, pre-Islamic, Islamic, and Jewish scholars, all wrote about it. The Jewish Kabbalists, in particular, engaged themselves in the study of Tay Al Ard, but had a different name for it, in Hebrew. They called it Kefitzat Haderach , meaning, word by word, ‘the jumping of the road,’ but translated as the ability to jump instantaneously from one place to another or travel with unnatural speed. It"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"was widely documented by them.” -“What about modern scientists?” I asked. -Rabbi Mordachai: “Einstein discussed it in a number of his papers, and it was a component of his General Relativity Theory, relating to the warping of space-time enabled by the effects of gravity.” -“I read fairy tales and science fiction stories about such things,” I said. -Rabbi Mordachai: “Of course you did. Fiction writers have been using it for many years,” said the Master. “But it is based on truth.” -“But I still don’t understand the principle of it,” I said. “How does the earth jump?” -Rabbi Mordachai: “There are many explanations,” said the Master, “none of them complete, since mysteries are sometimes only partially understood. Look at it this way. Newtonian physics, which did not allow such occurrences, were replaced long ago. Such things as wormholes, dark matter, and space-time fluidity allow much more flexibility in investigating teleportation. It is complicated."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"For example, Quantum physics has proven that particles, such as photons and atoms, can appear instantaneously at a new place without traveling through space in any visible manner. Perhaps this phenomenon is possible by encoding information about an object, transmitting the information to another place, and creating a copy of the original in the new location.” -“In this solution, then, the earth does not jump.” -Rabbi Mordachai: “This is correct. But in both explanations the physical phenomenon is similar, as it is based on the disintegration of the atoms, those of the earth or those of the person, and their reassembly at the place of destination. I see no true conflict here.” -“In the stories I read, the person just wishes to go somewhere, and there he goes,” I said. -Rabbi Mordachai: “Again, this is not a contradiction,” said the Master. “In Western science it is now assumed that space does not have an objective reality, and reality itself is thought of as observer-based and subjective entity. If so, then ideas such as traveling in space without"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"actually physically moving are no longer so strange. In this way, Tay Al Ard is viewed as the manipulation of reality by the person who wishes to travel from point one to point two in an environment that is subject to the traveler’s will.” -“And so,” I said, “the idea is everywhere, stories, science, different cultures, and you know many people who have done it. I suppose you have done it too.” -Rabbi Mordachai: “Yes, I have.” “Well, then,” I said, “why can’t I learn to do it right away?” -Rabbi Mordachai: “Because a child might be hurt in some of the places you might want to jump to. If the environment is not safe, and you are even a little bit confused by it, you won’t be able to find your way out and may even be killed. Let’s wait until you are an adult.” “Ah, well,” I said resignedly. “I guess the trip I was planning to the South Pole, to visit the penguins, must be postponed.” “Just a few years,” said the Master.

Later on in history, leading figures of the Knights of St John of Malta, the Knights Templar, the Wise Men of Arwad, and Hiram-Grand Orient Masonic Rites’ members joined the Jimaya. People are taught to believe that the world (Seen and unseen) consists of a physical life on Earth, and a spiritual life after death. The Arishim Ulema’s views are different.

The Anunnaki deploy “split-time-space technology” to travel to any region of the universe in a fraction of a minute. It could be compared to the “Stargate Technology”.

The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions or Predictions of the Cat) was very active in ancient Egypt and the Near East. On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin strongly recommend to adopt cats, and care for them, for they could be very useful to their owners; they are capable of sensing imminent dangers, catastrophes, mishaps, and above all, their instinctive nature leads them to warn their owners, little children, and people who love them against danger. Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A cat in the house is blessing.” Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if they bother to watch, study and understand their behavior. Quite often, cats stare at something the human eye can’t see. And in some instance, and for a few seconds, cats remain frozen in their attention upon looking at the unknown which seems to appear to them in etheric forms.

The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attention to the observing cat, to remain calm and patient, and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat is staring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat, and to take notes of the reaction of the cat. This exercise of ours should not stop there. We should keep on observing our cat, and taking notes, and above all to draw a map of the places in our home which seem to interest the cat and/or provoke the cat to sense the unseen; a map which could include more than one place in our home and locate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a web of openings, a sort of time-space vortices, or simply a “playground” for spirits.

So how this prayer could protect you from being hurt by evil and vicious people? There are several prayers you can use for this purpose, but Duu’aat lil Arwaah Nabila is a very powerful one, and can be tailored to meet your needs in very particular situations. For instance, let’s assume that there is a colleague of yours where you work who is constantly disturbing you, and/or hates your guts. Well, you can use this prayer to eliminate his/her vicious intentions; it is simple but requires certain preparation. Here is what you should do: You have to rewrite the prayer, and include his/her name wherever it is needed in the prayer. Example: On line 8: Prevent evil (The Bad Spirit, Evil as a"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"malevolent person) from entering my life. You should rewrite the sentence as follows: Prevent (Write here his or her name, for example Joe or Peggy) from entering my life. The sentence becomes: La taduu Joe or Peggy idkhaluu fee hayatee. You have simply replaced the word “shariir”. It is not complicated at all. But bear in mind, you must re-write this prayer on Sunday evening between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM. IV-During a séance: If you are in session with a summoned spirit, you do not need to write down the prayer. It would be sufficient to recite it. But you must use the Burqa’h according to the protocol of the spirits.

This is not a myth, since many people who reside nearby Hajarat Al Houblah have seen “Dark Ghosts” exiting from under the stone of the pregnant woman. Apparently the Djinn and Afarit of “Hajarat Al Houblah” are under the command of Cheik Al Baydani, who is 210 year old.

To my surprise, I saw a mysterious Sudanese man sitting in the back seat, dressed in ill matching jacket and pants and scowling at us. At the Master’s request, he started to get out of the car to introduce himself. I watched the process in fascination, since he was not doing it quickly like a normal person, but instead was slowly extricating himself in stages, gradually disentangling himself, like a huge snake. I have never seen such a tall man, or anyone as strange. He was about seven feet tall, very thin, and his face did not look quite human to me, but like a giant from outer space.

Taj folded himself back into the car and sat beside me, the Master went into the front seat, and the driver, who seemed to be normal and cheerful, greeted the Master and me in a friendly way. The car started making a noise that was worthy of demons, but I did not care because I was thinking about the real devils, the Djinn and the Afrit. I leaned forward and asked the Master, “Would I be able to see the Djinn and Afrit?” “Yes, of course,” said the Master casually. “You can even try to talk to them, if you like.

The Master screamed at Taj, “How dare you? How many times did I tell you never to do that? Give me the beads immediately!” Taj handed him the beads, meekly enough, and had the grace to look embarrassed. The Master rubbed the beads, seemingly absorbing and removing the energy, and then returned them to me. “You can try them now,” he said. “And don’t give them back to Taj until I tell you to.” Taj said nothing. He seemed unhappy in the car, constantly fidgeting, and could not sit still. Perhaps he was claustrophobic, I thought, and the confined space bothered him. We drove on. Finally we arrived in Baalbeck. “Where now?” said the driver. “We are going to the Athar , the ruins,” said the Master. “I don’t know how to get there,” said the"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"driver. “Shall I ask for directions?” He parked the car. There were many people around, some Arabs in traditional garb, some Europeans in every kind of attire and carrying backpacks and cameras. It seemed to be such a normal, cheerful place. I thought of the festivals and the music; how could there be Afrit and Djinn and all sorts of underground labyrinths in a place like that? It was as modern as can be. “When you are with Taj, you do not ask for directions,” said the Sudanese with a superior air. The driver shrugged, not quite convinced. Taj winked at me and stared at the driver’s neck, concentrating. The driver suddenly started to beat his own neck, complaining how much he hated mosquitoes. I was certain there were no mosquitoes in the car, and I was sure that Taj created the imaginary insects that were tormenting the driver. The driver’s neck became really red. “Taj, stop this nonsense immediately!” said the Master severely. Apparently, Taj could"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"send certain energy rays that had the capacity of annoying people. Taj stopped, gave the driver the necessary directions, and we went to the Athar. “First, let’s go to the world biggest stone,” said Taj. We drove further, and as we turned a road toward the Temple of Jupiter, I was shocked by the sight that met my eyes. It was a huge gray slab, partially buried in the sand, perfectly cut and smooth. It was unquestionably man made, not a natural formation, a short distance from the Temple. How in the world could such a stone get there? Who could have carried it? This stone was so immense that the stones of the Egyptian pyramids would be infinitely small, completely dwarfed, if put next to it. The Stonehenge monoliths would be insignificant if they were placed next to it. In addition, it was immensely old, and even modern equipment could hardly cope with such a giant, let alone ancient technology. “How big is this stone?” I asked, truly"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"awed by the sight. “Seventeen hundred tons,” said the Master. “It is hand made, isn’t it?” I said. “It is too straight to be natural. It simply can’t be natural. And yet, how could it get here, if it is artificial? It just can’t!” Taj grinned and said, “Hand made, yes, but not by human hands.” I was beginning to get the idea. “Then who made it?” I asked. “It was part of the landing area used by the Anunnaki,” said the Master. “There are six stones like it. Only the Anunnaki could move such a slab.” “Ah, but I can make it fly,” boasted Taj. “You must be crazy,” I said, disgusted with him. “You want to see?” He said. “Sure,” I said. “I would like to see you do that.” “Very well, but not when so many people are around. We will be back around nine o’clock, no"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"one is around, I will show you.” Since it was around four o’clock in the afternoon, I was wondering how we would spend the time, but the Master had his own plan. “We have plenty of time to do what needs to be done,” he said. “I would like you to meet Cheik Al Huseini.” This was the first time I met the great man, who later contributed greatly to my studies. We went back into the car, and drove to the Cheik’s house. The house was small and modest, built sturdily of stone, with thick walls. The door was low, as was normal for middle class Arab houses. This style was followed for many years, for the sake of safety and security. Apparently, the conquering Ottomans used to sweep into houses that had large entrances while riding on their horses, and thus be able to kill and destroy anyone and everything inside. The low entrances forced the rider to get off his horse first, making him much less dangerous to the inhabitants. In the big living room, which they called the Dar , many sofas were placed against the walls,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"arranged next to each other. About twenty to thirty men were present, dressed in Arab robes and turbans. All were elderly, with long white beards. The Cheik was sitting in the place of honor. When the Master arrived, everyone stood up, repeating the word “ oustaz, oustaz ,” to each other, meaning “teacher.” Someone pointed at Taj, and said, “The Afrit is already here.” I thought this description fitted Taj perfectly, but expected him to be angry. To my surprise, he seemed pleased by being called that name, and grinned at me like a delighted child. We sat down, and the men came to kiss the hand of the Master. The light was low, only one lamp was turned on, but I could see that one person did not get up from his seat. Since this was strange behavior, I looked at him carefully, and to my amazement recognized the old Tuareg, whom I had met years ago in the suk in Damascus, the man who was cut in half. He recognized me as well, smiled, and motioned to me to come and sit by him. I came, and he said jokingly, “Don’t start searching for the rest"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"of my body...” I laughed, a little guilty, because that was exactly what I was planning to do. At any rate I could see nothing, since the long robe he wore covered everything. Everyone conversed in Arabic, which by now I spoke very well, and after a while the Cheik motioned most people out. Eight of us remained in the room. The Master, Taj, and myself, were the only outsiders. The Cheik, the Tuareg, and three other elderly Arabs completed the number of the people who were permitted to attend. At that moment, a man came from an inside room, carrying a big copper pot, full of steaming hot water. He put the pot on a table in front of the Cheik, addressing him by the title Mawlana . This title meant “you are a ruler over me,” and was used only to address kings, sultans, or prophets. I was surprised. This title belonged to very important people, but the house and everything in it spoke of middle class. So what"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"could this mean? The Cheik must have been a very important person, somehow. I planned to ask the Master about it later, not wishing to disturb him with questions at the moment, since I was sure strange things were about to begin to occur. I was sitting near enough to the Cheik to see everything very clearly, and waited breathlessly for the events that were to come. The Cheik took three pieces of blank paper, and threw them into the hot water in the copper container. The room was completely silent, no one moved, except Taj, who whispered to me, “You are going to like what you see, it’s fun, but don’t move no matter what happens.” I nodded, and concentrated on the pot, looking occasionally at Taj for clarification. Somehow he assumed the role of my guide to the occult world, and I realized he knew exactly what was taking place. “Shush, just look at the container, something is about to happen,” he said. I went on staring at the pot. Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, the water in the container disappeared, and the three pieces"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"of paper burst out of the container. They lined up in the air, without any support, one after the other. They waved about for a few seconds, then merged and became one larger piece. The piece of paper started swirling in the air, rotating around itself, quicker and quicker, and suddenly stopped in mid motion. It was suspended in the air, completely still, and in a flash, letters appeared on it, printed clear, black, and easily visible from where I was sitting, though I could not make out the words. The Cheik got up, approached the paper, read the words, and then asked one of the people attending to close the shutters on all the windows. The room became very dark, and the words, seemingly separated from the paper, glowed in air like a bright hologram. The Cheik called Taj, and asked him to read the words. I could not hear what they said to each other, but they seemed to agree on something, as they stood there, nodding their heads. Then Taj came back to me."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"I asked him, “What was that?” He stepped on my foot to quiet me. His large foot’s imprint was painful, so I shut up. Everyone else seemed to accept the phenomenon without trouble, and gazed at the Cheik as he began to move in a strange manner. He looked to the left, mumbling something incoherent, then to the right, saying the same incomprehensible things, repeating the sequence twice. Then he lifted his hands as if in prayer, in the manner shared by both Jews and Muslims. Touching his chest and pushing his hands in front of him, he said, “ Ahlan, ahalan, ahlan, ahalan, bee salamah .” The letters were still glowing in front of him in the air, and he added, “ Asma’ oo hoosmah ath sab’ha .” I turned and pinched Taj, whispering feverishly, “Explain!” “Don’t you know anything?” said Taj. “These are the names of seven Afrits. They are going to open the gate of the underworld for us.”"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" “But...” He stomped on my foot again to shut me up, and it really hurt and I kept quiet. The Cheik said, rather loudly: “ Bakhooor, bakhooor !” A man appeared out of nowhere and brought an incense holder. The Cheik moved it back and forth, the room filled with smoke, and everyone started to chant and mumble very loudly. I understood nothing at all of what they said. It seemed they were speaking in tongues, and the effect was frightening. They went on for a couple of minutes, then stopped abruptly. At that instant, the letters pulled together, became one shining ball of light of intense silver color, and zoomed out of the room into thin air. One of the people opened the shutters and the late afternoon light streamed in. The Cheik put his right hand on his heart and said “Thank you” three times. I was wondering who exactly he was thanking, and who, originally, was he praying for, since he never used the words God, Allah, or any other recognizable deity name. I did not realize at the time that the Ulema, even when they were"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Arabs, where not Muslims, and had their own, very different, world view. The Master got up. Everyone rose with him, their robes swishing and making a faint sound in the quiet room. The Tuareg floated in the air. I looked at him, doing my best to control my discomfort. His upper body was solid, but the bottom half of the robe was obviously empty as it swirled around him, making the absence of his lower body extremely and disturbingly clear. He seemed like an apparition, a ghost. Everyone came to the Master, bowed to him, and then grabbed his hand with both of theirs, in a way that was clearly ceremonial. The right hand’s thumb was hitting the spot between the thumb and first finger of the left hand, and then the left hand covered the right hand. The Tuareg floated near the master and did the same thing. Everyone looked at each other and thanked each other a few times, following their thanks with the words “ Rama Ahaab .” I did not know this word, and was not aware that they were speaking Ana’kh, the language that was shared by"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the Anunnaki and the Ulema. And yet I sensed that there was something very special about the way they spoke, as if by instinct. I was staring at the people and trying to understand their words until the Master tapped me on the shoulder and told me to come out. Taj left with me, and said, “You talk too much. You should be paying more attention, such an occasion is not likely to happen again!” I shrugged, but I had to admit to myself that he was right, these events were probably unique. To my surprise, I was beginning to like the Sudanese, and no longer felt threatened by his strange appearance and bizarre behavior. “Won’t you tell me a bit about the Afrit?” I asked, licking my lollipop. “I am not sure why we need to call them. Why can’t we just go into the underground city? I don’t quite understand anything that is going on here.” “In your home, in France, do you have a Jaras , a bell, on your door?” he asked. “Yes, of course,” I said, surprised at the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"question. “Well, you see, the underground city do not have a Jaras, and it is locked. If you want to come in, someone must let you in. The Afrit can help you, but you have to call them in a special way. Otherwise, they don’t know you want them to open the door. How would they know? They are not too clever.” “Where is the door?” I said. He pointed to the ground. “Under you, under the house, there is a door. Right under the Cheik’s house. A door to the Aboo , the deep abyss. It is also called Dahleeth , meaning an underground labyrinth.” “Are there other doors?” “Very likely, but I only know this one.” As if reading my mind, he put his hand in the inner pocket of his ill fitting and flashy jacket, pulled out two lollipops, and handed me one. One of the people came out of the house, motioned to us to come in, and said, “We are ready.” In the house, everyone was wearing a white robe, and to my surprise, their heads were"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"covered with the type of head scarf Jews sometimes wore in the synagogue. To confuse the issue even further, one was holding a scroll that resembled a Torah. I felt desperate. Were they going to delay our journey again and start praying? I really wanted move on, see the Afrit, have the adventure. I was tired of the delays. Thankfully, one of them handed me a robe and commanded me to go change my clothes, which I did, but Taj did not change his attire. I asked him why he was not required to do so, and he explained that he was not one of the Al Moomawariin , or the enlightened ones, so he was not required to wear the special outfit. This did not really clarify the matter, since I was not one of the enlightened ones either, but I decided to let it pass. Taj seemed to be right about the door being under the Cheik’s house, because we started to descend the steps to the basement. The basement was long and narrow, and had a very high ceiling, perhaps the height of two stories. Everything, floor,"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"walls, ceiling, were made entirely of gray cement. It smelled of dampness, and was very cold. We went through a one room after another, all narrow and long, eventually reaching a small room that had an iron gate by its far wall. The Cheik opened the gate with a large key, and behind it was a second door, made of thick wood. A second key opened this one. Suddenly a thought struck me. Why did he need a key? Why couldn’t a man who had such supernatural powers simply command the doors to open? Or pass through them like a ghost, for that matter? I expressed my thought to Taj. “It won’t work,” said Taj. “Yes, of course the Cheik could pass through doors, but how would he take you with him?”  “What do you mean?” I asked, bewildered. “You are not enlightened as yet. You cannot use supernatural means of transportation at this stage, so if he wants you, or me, for that matter, to pass through these doors, he must take you"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"inside in a normal way. If he tried, you will just bang against the doors and hurt yourself, while he would be on the other side.” I began to see that Taj was not stupid at all. Childish, and sometimes pretending to be silly and play silly games, but deep down, he was extremely knowledgeable. We stood together in the small room, exactly like all the other rooms in the basement. The Cheik said, “Let the boy be the last one. He needs protection. Taj, come here.” Taj joined him at the front of the line, and we entered a long corridor. As we were walking, the corridor began to shift its shape. I felt seasick, nauseated, my balance was lost. The floor, and walls, everything was moving, rolling, undulating. I did not see clearly, and wondered how long this torment would last, when suddenly all movement stopped. I looked around and nearly jumped with terror. The simple corridor became a cave! A natural cave, not a man made structure. Stone, dirt, and natural formations were"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"all around me. It smelled damp and filthy, water were oozing from some of the walls, and the light was dim. I did not like the place. The Master told everyone except me to stand in a crescent shaped row, and hold hands. He ordered me to stand behind the crescent, and not to touch anyone. I was hurt. I felt neglected, as if I were not part of the group, until one of the people turned to me and said kindly, “Don’t be upset, my boy. This is for your protection.” So I just stood there behind the people, feeling silly in my long white robe, but not unhappy anymore. At that moment, Taj made a sweeping motion with his hands and body, and screamed a few words. The horrible sound he emitted was not human. It was very likely the loudest sound I had ever heard. He continued to move his hands violently, grabbed some dirt from the ground, and threw it up in the air. He pronounced a word that to me sounded like a name, and followed it by the word “ Eehdar !” three times."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Then he said, “ Oodkhool ,” three times. Immediately, a rubbery kind of form moved to the left, changed to a paste-like substance, and attached itself like glue to the wall. The sticky, pale mess looked like ectoplasm. Taj repeated his actions a few times, manifesting a new ectoplasmic manifestation on the wall with each call. Then, he looked at the Cheik and said, “ Tamam !” The Cheik and Taj were engaged in a conversation in low voices. They seemed to be in agreement, since the Cheik said, “Yes, go ahead.” Taj advanced toward the ectoplasmic forms, put his hand in his jacket’s pocket and took something out, and gave some to each of them. At this moment, the Cheik stepped forward, ready to take over, and said “ Iibriiz !” The forms burst into flame, which burned the ectoplasm and produced a thick fog. From the fog appeared human forms, but there were only six of them. The Cheik said “ Wawsabeh !” The Master came forward, stood by the Cheik, and the Cheik repeated the word, adding, “ Anna a’mooree"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"khum !” and the seventh creature came. Later Taj told me that these Afrit were originally created by the Cheik for a reason, as they usually are, and in the normal state of events were supposed to become the Cheik’s loyal servants. However, the Cheik made a mistake and did not perform the exact requirements needed in the procedure of the creation, and therefore he lost control over the Afrit. The result was disturbing. The seven Afrit developed independent and rather evil habits, and did not quite obey the Cheik as they should. For some reason, the only one who could call them to appear was Taj. However, that is all he could do. Since Taj was not an Enlightened One, he could not control them once they came, and to a certain extent was at their mercy and had to have an Ulema present if he were to avoid potential harm. As for another Ulema controlling them instead of Taj and the Cheik, that was not possible. The Ulema have four categories, based on their"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"form of existence. Some Ulema are physical and live as humans, like the Master and the Cheik. Some used to be physical, but were no longer so. Some, like the Tuareg, straddled both forms. Others have never occupied a human form. All four versions of the Ulema can exercise immense powers, no matter if they are physical or non physical, but a physical Ulema can only control non physical entities, such as these Afrits, if he was their creator. I shuddered as I watched the Afrit. At this point of my studies, I had my share of supernatural incidences, but I have never been so shaken before. In the semi darkness of this miserable, damp place, the Afrits were truly terrifying. Each had a more or less human face, but in this almost normal face the eyes were not at all normal. Instead, each Afrit had two circular orbs, with white background and a black pupil that stood out as if painted. The eyes did not move. If the Afrit wanted to look to the side, it had to move its whole head. The head was not connected to the body. Instead, it floated in a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"disconcerting, eerie fashion, just above the body. When the Afrit manifest, their bodies often appear first and for a few minutes appears headless, until they choose to manifest the head. This fact, coupled by their appalling ugliness, can frighten a human being to the point of death. There had been recorded incidents of people dying of heart attack or stroke caused by such events. I kept myself as calm as possible and continued to study the Afrit. The heads were bad enough, but the bodies were even worse. They were tinted a shadowy, ugly, dark color. The torso resembled the shape of a bat. Their arms were attached to the back of the body, and the hands had extremely long fingers. Since the Afrit don’t eat or breathe, they don’t need a stomach and a diaphragm. Therefore, the body had a sort of visible cavity in the front, where these organs would have been. The legs were twisted, like entangled wires, which must help the Afrit as they jump. They rarely stay in one place for long, and keep shaking and"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"moving and twitching. They looked back at us, their ugly faces twisted in a devilish, vicious smile. They kept chattering among themselves and pointing at us with their long fingers. But Taj told me that despite their apparent boldness, they were afraid of the Enlightened Ones. Any Afrit can see the shining auras of the Ulema, and for some reason they are terrified of these auras. The Cheik commanded the Afrit to open the door. I did not understand the language he spoke, but I figured it out because he used the word “ Babu ,” which is so similar to the word Ba’ab . Babu is really a door, though, while ba’ab is a gate, but the words were close enough to make it clear to me that they were going to open the door to the underground world. I was speechless with anticipation. Everyone stood still, looking at the far wall of the cave, so I stared at it too, not knowing what to expect.  The far wall of the cave suddenly"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"collapsed, in total silence. It felt like a silent movie, because there was no dust and no sound of falling stones during the procedure. The stones tumbled down quietly, one by one, disappearing altogether rather than forming a solid pile. The wall was replaced by dark, hazy fog, that allowed us a glimpse of some far away buildings. “Now,” said the Cheik to Taj, “Let’s follow the Afrit, but don’t let them play tricks on you.” Taj nodded. We went through the fog, following another corridor and crossing identical rooms that seemed to follow each other in succession, all the while seeing the far off buildings in the distance. The Cheik started reciting something. The Afrit were jumping up and down like carousel horses, while pushing forward with great speed, and were already a good distance away from us, going on their own mysterious errands. Taj said to me, “You can now move to the front, it’s safe now, the Afrit won’t pay much attention to us anymore.” I quickly moved near the"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Master at the head of the line, and no one took notice of what I was doing. We did not move on yet. The Cheik asked Taj to show him a piece of paper he was holding, probably a kind of a map, and asked, “Do you know which room we need?” “Yes,” said Taj. “I know exactly where it is, it’s very near us. I will go in, and if I find something, I will bring some pieces back to you so you can see them, and then we can all go in and bring everything.” Taj left for about five minutes, and returned with a beautiful pearl necklace, a few diamonds, and some Phoenician coins. He told the Cheik and the Master, “We can go in now, but remember, you promised that all the gold belongs to Taj.” “Of course,” said the Cheik casually. “But remember,” said the Master, “We are not just going into the treasure room. You will also take us to the other room, as you promised.” It was clear to me that the Ulema were not in the least interested in the treasure, but there was"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"something else in this underground cavern that meant much more to them than any gold or diamonds. The Ulema do not need gold. They can manufacture whatever wealth they need, and they never manufacture or acquire more than they need. Riches are of no interest to them at all. “Certainly I will take you to the other room,” said Taj. “I know exactly where it is.” He seemed quite pleased by the bargain. We followed Taj into a small, closed room. It had no windows but was brightly lit, allowing us to see gold, gems, diamonds, and pearls stashed in boxes, jars, or simply thrown on the floor in heaps. However, I was not very interested in gold either. What I wondered about was the source of the mysterious illumination. No windows, no lamps, no candles, but bright light in every corner of the room. What could cause this? Suddenly I realized it had to be the same type of light that was discovered in the Pharaonic tombs and catacombs of ancient Egypt."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Originally, the archaeologists who went there were baffled by the light in the Egyptian tunnels, until they discovered the contraption that the ancient Egyptians had created. They found conical objects that functioned like modern batteries, producing light that was so much like normal electrical light that there was hardly a difference. The batteries had to be placed in a certain way against each other, or they would not light, and worse, could burn the user since they packed a lot of energy in their structure. I suspected this had to be the same type of illumination. Taj pointed the door that would take us to the room the Master wished to visit. The Master asked him, “Do you want to come with us?” “I will follow you as soon as I am finished here,” said Taj, grinning. He pulled some linen bags from under his jacket, and busily started filling them with the treasure. The Master smiled indulgently at him, as if Taj was a child playing with some toys that meant little to adults but pleased the child a great deal."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"He said to the rest of us, “Well then, let’s go to the next room.” We opened the door. Inside it was pitch black, but the Master stepped in without the slightest hesitation, and we followed. I envied his confidence. As far as I was concerned, how did we know an angry Afrit was not waiting for us? But since no one else showed any fear, I went with them. We could see nothing, but the Master kept talking to us and so we were able to follow him. All of sudden, bright light filled the room. I blinked a few times, and then saw the Master standing by one of the walls, holding two conical, golden objects in each hand, positioned against each other. I was right, here were the ancient batteries. The room was empty of furniture other than a beautiful wooden table, carved into arabesques, much like Moroccan furniture. The Master placed the batteries carefully on the table, making sure the alignment allowed"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"them to continue to produce light. I looked around. Other than the batteries and the table, the only object in the room was a large Phoenician urn, standing in one of the corners. “We are going to leave you here for a short while,” said the Master to the group. “The Cheik and I are going to get the materials we need for our project.” “We’ll be right back,” added the Cheik with what seemed to me rather misguided optimism. There were Djinn and Afrit here! Wasn’t anyone concerned about these devils? The Master and the Cheik walked to the end of the room, very slowly, with measured, matching steps, as if choreographed. Then they reached the far wall, and literally went through the wall to the other side. I was not exactly shocked, since I have seen the Master go through walls before. It is an interesting phenomenon, but not as mysterious as one might think. To put it simply, the Ulema know how to control molecules; the Master had explained it to"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"me thoroughly. Everyone knows that there is plenty of empty space between the molecules of any matter, and the Ulema make use of that fact with a specialized procedure. As the person who wishes to cross approaches the wall, the wall gradually becomes soft, as if its molecules fragment themselves, and the human body simultaneously does the same. The spaces between the molecules of both grow and readjust. The person and the wall keep their shapes for an instant, then their molecules mingle and allow the passage. At that moment, the person passes to the other side, the molecules separate, and both wall and person become solid and normal again. The rest of us waited for about half an hour. I was beginning to worry. The Cheik said they would be right back! Something must have prevented them from doing so. Perhaps the Afrit, who has by now completely disappeared, took them away, kidnapped them, led them somewhere horrible? I asked some of the other people if they knew what"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"was going on, but they had no idea where the Cheik and the Master went. However, they did not seem worried, making it clear to me that they trusted these two to know what to do. “Don’t worry,” one of them said to me. “They can handle a lot worse than those stupid Afrits.” “I don’t wish to contradict, Sir,” I said, “but these Afrit seem pretty dangerous to me. The way they were pointing and smiling...” The others laughed. “I have seen the Cheik and the Master handle much worse entities,” said the man who spoke to me, very kindly. “Remember, the Afrist are cowards. They are mortally afraid of the auras of the Ulema.” “But I understand the Cheik needs some help because of the way he handled their creation,” I said. “Yes, this is true,” said the man. “These Afrit did turn out a bit wild. But with the Master there, they will never dare to harm them.” I had to be content with that. So I went in search of Taj, to see how he was doing with the treasure, perhaps"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"help him finish filling his bags. I called him and was about to reenter the room, but I heard him scream, “Don’t come here!” and he tumbled out of the room, bleeding, and slammed the door behind him. “The Afrit beat me,” he gasped. “Beat me very badly.” “But Taj, you could handle those seven Afrit so well! What happened to give them power over you?” “Seven? Are you joking? There is a colony here, something like forty of fifty Afrit, and they all rushed at me and would not let me take the gold.” “Is it their gold?” I asked. “What do they want it for, anyway? They don’t need money.” “No, it’s not their gold. It used to belong to the Phoenicians, and now it belongs to no one in particular. But the Afrit like to play with it. They like shining things.” “But you are holding one bag, I see.” “Yes, I managed to save one bag. They got all the others, those slimy devils.” He smiled, regaining his composure. “Never mind, though."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"After all, I will be a very wealthy man even with just one bag. This treasure is amazing... Anyway, we must secure the door. Hold the bag for a minute.” He pushed the bag in my hands, turned, and repeated the same words he used when he originally called the Afrit, and gestured in the same way. While he was doing that, I heard shrieks and screams, which he later explained was the way the Afrit spoke as they were chased away. “That is that,” he said, surveying the door with satisfaction. “They won’t bother us again.” He took the bag and smiled at me through the caked blood and filth on his face. “A successful treasure hunt, ah, Germain? And some day I’ll come back for more.” Back in the other room, I saw, to my considerable relief, that the Cheik and the Master have returned. The Cheik was holding a stack of forty or fifty sheets made of shiny plastic, or plasma, or glass, and the Master had the same size stack, but of a different type of material, brownish yellow like corn."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" “What is that?” I asked Taj. “I have no idea,” said Taj. “They only told me which room I was supposed to take them to, but they did not tell me what project they were engaged in. I must say I have a hunch it is something terribly important.” I thought so too, since the Cheik and the Master seemed to be extremely solemn, and everyone else was completely silent. There was a strong feeling of expectation in the room. They each put his stack on the table, the Cheik on the right, the Master on the left, leaving a space between the stacks, and I noticed that the space matched the size of the stacks. The Master brought the urn from the corner to the table, and made a motion of pouring something out of the urn into the space between the stacks. I saw nothing coming out of the jar, but I figured that it might be an invisible substance. This went on for about twenty seconds, then the Master returned the urn to the corner. The Cheik took one sheet from his stack, and put it in the space between the stacks. The Master then took"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"a sheet from his own stack, put it on the Cheik’s sheet, and waited a couple of seconds. Then the Master flipped his sheet back side up, and to my absolute amazement, there was print on the sheet, strong and black, consisting of strange symbols and letters I did not recognize. Piling the sheets on top of each other, they did the same to all of them. Surprisingly, the stack, when finished, was reduced in size to about a half of the original sheets, even though I could not see it reducing itself while it was worked on. I think that the plasma sheets were absorbed into the corn-like paper as the print was produced, but I am not sure. The Cheik pulled out a silk scarf from his robe, put the stack on the scarf, rolled it, lifted the ends of the scarf and tied them together, all in a ritualistic way. Then he said, “ Al Hamdu ” twice. They turned to go, and we left the room. The Master, throughout the entire time, paid hardly any attention to me, which bothered me a little. I felt neglected, even abandoned. He must have noticed my unhappy face, because he put his hand on my shoulder, took me back into the room, and"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"said, “Look!” To my amazement, the room was entirely empty. The table and the urn had disappeared. I was confused and uncomfortable. I could not understand why all that was necessary. Why Afrit? Why those doors? Where did the table go? What was this document and why was it worth all this effort? He laughed at my questions and said, “Look at the wall.” The light was dimming as we spoke, and finally disappeared. It seemed this adventure was over, and I said, rebelliously, that I wish things were made clear to me, because otherwise, I have learned nothing. I will explain everything later, Germain. I promise” “But what about the city you said we are about to see? The city where the Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to come to? The city from before the Deluge?” “So you want to see more? This was not enough?”"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" “Yes,” I said. “Basically, all I saw was you and the Cheik going through a wall and Taj fighting with the Afrit, which I admit were scary but were not too significant, I believe. I did not see anything remotely connected to the ancient city.” “Well,” he said, “in this case, turn, and walk with me. You are already walking in this city.” I looked around, and saw nothing, but he said, “Keep walking, it will come.” I should have trusted him more fully. After all, when did he ever disappoint me? I felt remorseful as the miracle began to enfold in front of my eyes, but thankfully, he did not hold my short term rebellion against me, and went on cheerfully enough. Slowly, the ancient city started to appear like a Polaroid picture in front of me. The colors of the city were such as I have never seen before, glowing colors of incredible beauty. The Master explained that this was because the city was located in a space that had the same temperature everywhere, and no pressure on any"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"object. Unlike earth. “What do you mean, Master, when you say ‘unlike earth’ like that? Are we not on earth?” “No, we have left earth when the Afrit opened the door and made the cave wall collapse. We are now in another dimension,” said the Master. “Everything looks a little different here.” The city became clearer, and I thought it looked like a holographic projection, either from the past, or from the future. The buildings, though beautiful, had a sense of alien, remote places. We were now walking in a well-illuminated street, the windows of the buildings shining with lights as well. The air was soft and fragrant. “I see buildings and streets,” I said. “But where are the people?” “They are here, but they are invisible to you. Your eyes are not constructed to see them, not yet,” he said. “Well, it is time to leave. Let’s go up these stairs.” We started climbing a very high, stone stairway that led from the street into a destination"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"that was not quite visible. I was surprised that we were not retracing out steps into the Cheik’s house, but the Master said there was no need for that, and that exits were available in various locations, and not as difficult to achieve as entrances. So we climbed the stairs, and when we reached the top, I saw a huge gray wall on my left, and noticed that the pavement turned into sand. The huge gray wall was the side of the Anunnaki stone. I understood that we exited from a hole under the big stone, were out of the strange dimension, and back on earth. “So that is what Taj meant when he said he would make the stone fly?” I said. “Yes, a rather poetic way of describing our trip,” said the Master. “Master, I am not wearing the white robe! I am wearing the normal clothes I left at the Cheik’s house.” “Indeed, and so is everyone else,” he said, pointing to the rest of the company, who were"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"already standing near the giant stone, and wearing normal clothes. “So what did we come here for? Surely not just to give Taj his treasure?” “We came for the book, son. Everything we did was much worth it, even the encounter with the unpleasant and stupid Afrit. We have recently heard that the book was here, in this dimension, after having searched for it unsuccessfully for generations. And now we have recovered a copy of the most important book in the world.” “The strange book you printed from the stacks? What is it?” “It is one of the very few copies in existence of what is probably the oldest book to have ever been written. A book the Anunnaki had valued very much. It is called The Book of Rama Dosh .” I didn’t know why, but a shiver went through my spine when I heard the name of the Ancient book; the sound of the name triggered a reaction in my mind. For a second I had a feeling"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"of tottering on the brink of a dark, warm abyss that contained something older than the universe, and glowed with endless stars. It passed quickly, and the Master continued. “In the future, you will have the privilege of studying it. It contains the knowledge that may, some day, save humanity from its own folly. At least I hope so with all my heart. And now, back to Damascus! Our friendly driver is waiting for us in the car. ” - Co-authored by Maximillien de Lafayette and Dr. Anbel Baada bakra (Baa’dah Bakrah): Translated verbatim: After tomorrow. The Sih’r meaning: 40 days. It refers to the 40 day period after the death of a person. This period is very critical in spiritism and Sih’r’s study because mediums can contact the dead only during this very precise period. On the 41 st day, the spirit of the deceased (Soul to others) departs to another dimension, if the dead person has decided to do so. This happens when a dead person realizes that he/she is no longer"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"among the “Living”, for many dead people become confused after death and don’t know what it is happening to them. Once the mind of the dead person understands that he/she has left Earth for good, and is currently a dead person, his/her mind offers him/her two possibilities: First possibility: To accept this fact and moves on to a higher dimension, or to another dimension. Second possibility: To remain in this state of nothingness and to wander forever, because the deceased is either confused, unwilling to accept the fact that he/she is dead, or simply because he/she remains deeply attached to the physical world (Earth) he/she lived in. Since time stops to progress in the afterlife, and since there are no more days, no more weeks, no more months, and no more years to count, the calendar of dead people freezes immediately on the following day of their death; this is why and how we got the expression “After tomorrow” Baada bkara, meaning the next day (After"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"tomorrow) following our death. After our death we age only by one day! In the afterlife, people stop to age and stop to feel pain, however, some of them retain some sort of space-time memory; an etheric memory. This spatial memory retains some images and feelings, a dead person has experienced when he/she was still alive. And those images and feelings remain very dear and extremely important to him/her, and make him/her deeply attached to physical values and substances. Some Sahiriin use this “Physical Attachment” as a tool, or as a conduit to communicate with the dead. The Sahiriin, Rouhaniyiin, and especially the group of the Anunnaki-Ulema have developed a technique to contact dead persons, or more precisely to remain in touch with them.

If you look at your body very carefully, you will find out that your body is an extremely complicated machine and your brain consists of a very intricate wiring system that requires an engineer or at least a first class designer. In summary, you did not come right away without a plan, without a well-thought design, and without an idea that created the design and execution of your physical body. At the very beginning and early stage of the creation of your physical body, the “Divine” or “Superior” architect-engineer conceived your physical looks as a picture in the astral world."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"For now call the astral world, “The world of ideas”; a non-physical world. In a non-physical world, everything is non- physical, it is astral, it is ethereal. When the ethereal image or idea becomes reality and adopts physical properties like eyes, legs, feet and bones, this idea or your “prototype” becomes a physical body and enters the physical world via the womb of your mother. Yet, it remains deeply and directly connected to the draft of the first copy of your physical body. Since the first draft of your non-physical body and your recently acquired physical body (Or about to be developed in the womb of your mother) are still connected to each other, both bodies (The Idea or Draft and your physical body) co-exist. The physical body is inside your mother, and the non-physical body called double or first body exists outside the physical world. The other copy, or more precisely the first"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"copy of YOU is called your Double. As soon as you begin to develop as a small physical body (a small fetus) inside the womb of your mother, the idea or draft that created you before you entered the womb of your mother begins to feed your brain’s cells and program your intellect. In other words, your brain begins to receive all the information and characteristics that will create and define your personality, temper, character, persona and nature. During the very first 40 days, everything your “Creator” wanted you to be or become start to “go inside your brain” and in the physiology of your body. During this very critical intellectual and physical formation, the other aspect of you, your Double, enters a dimension very close to your mother, and once your mother delivers you, your double, the non-physical body will leave the “surroundings” of your mother and follow you. From this moment on, your Double will stay"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"with you until you die. The double interacts with us in a most fascinating way, noticeable only to the “small child we are”, and not to the others. Many children have seen their double. And many of them spoke to their double, and played with their double. In many instances, babies and children called their double “my friend”, or “a friend who came to visit me.” Unfortunately, many parents discouraged their small children from talking about their “imaginary friends”, or fantasizing about the visits of their unseen friends.” This is very common. Ulema children are encouraged to talk about their “imaginary friends”. These are very precious moments in our lives, because during this stage, the infant and later on, the small child, has a direct access to his/her double. If the child is deprived from this contact, the Double could dissipate for ever. Of course, in the future, the Double might"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"appear again on certain occasions. But, because we have lost touch with our Double, and we no longer remember the beautiful and friendly visits of our forgotten imaginary friends, our mind and common sense will automatically dismiss the sudden apparition of our Double as a reality. In these instances, people quite often say: “I am seeing things”, or “Am I hallucinating?” Therapists rush so quickly to explain the phenomenon as a trick by the mind. It is not a trick at all. It just happened that your Double is paying you a visit. Instead of questioning your sanity, you must rejoice and welcome your “friend”. In fact, your Double is the most truthful, caring and best friend you ever had, simply because it is YOU! Your Double appeared to you for many reasons. Your “double” always watches over you. It cares about you. Its presence is a sign of friendship, sometimes necessary and indispensable for solving your problems and"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"finding a way to get out of trouble. You should welcome your Double and listen to. The initiated ones can contact their Double; it is a matter of learning, practice and patience. However, you have to remember, that the living cannot contact the dead. By reaching the sphere of your Double or Astral Body, you are reaching yourself, not a dead substance, a departed entity or a spirit. Untrained persons cannot contact their Double, but can be trained and taught by the Ulema. And the training has nothing to do with magic, spiritism or religious trances and state of ecstasy. It is purely mental, intellectual, and scientific. Here, we will be talking about two situations: First situation: Your Double materializes before you on its own, Second situation: You initiate the contact with your Double. Sometimes, the Astral Body materializes before you eyes, even though you did not try"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"to contact it. This apparition has many meanings, and could be interpreted differently according to the circumstances. Sometimes, your Double appears to you to warn you against an imminent danger. Sometimes, to guide you in a moment of despair and difficulties. Some other times, when you “see yourself” as a fragile ectoplasmic thin substance like a fog for instance, your Double apparition is telling you, that a very important event is going to happen and it could change the course of your life. In rare instances, this apparition could mean that your days are numbered. Short after Lord Byron saw his Double he passed way. In the second situation: Now, you are trying to contact your Double. You initiate the contact. If you are not one of the enlightened persons, you would not know what to do, and where to start.

In contacting your Double, you must have an introduction that comes in the form of an entry or entrance into the “Al-Madkhal”. Al Madkhal means verbatim: Entrance and/or where you step in. Ba’ab is a spatial place that exists around the physical dimension of our world. In the Anunnaki-Ulema vocabulary, Ba’ab means verbatim: Door. And from and through this door you enter the other dimension where your astral body (Your Double) exists. In the West, ufologists, and even space scientists nickname Ba’ab “Stargate.” It is not totally correct, because to them, stargate is a gate through which spaceships can travel through the infinity of space and conquer space-time, thus reducing the enormous distances between stars and planets, and reaching destinations in the universe at a speed greater than the speed of sound and light."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"For the Ulema, the Ba’ab can be used as a spatial stargate, and a mental means to reach the non- physical world as well; no spaceships are needed to communicate with your Double.

Some have depicted it as the primordial source of energy that makes the body function and maintain its equilibrium. The Anunnaki did not create “Souls” in the human body, but a primordial energy called “Fikr”.

The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin are known for their ability of contacting this substance. Fik’r and Double : Fik’r is the ability of reading future events and others’ thoughts. Derived from the Anakh words Fik-R’r, and Fik.Ra.Sa. The esoteric Arabic word “Firasa” is derived from Fik.Ra.Sa. It means in Arabic the ability to read thoughts, to understand the psyche of a person just by looking at him/her. The Ulema uses Fik’r to read the mind, to learn about the intentions of others, and assess the level"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"of intelligence of people. This can be done through seeing the information/data stored on the two lines of the person’s Khateyn Tarika. According to the doctrine and Kira’at of the Ulema, the soul is an invention of early humans, who needed to believe in a next life. It was through the soul that mortals could and would hope to continue to live after death. Soul as an element or a substance does not exist anywhere inside the human body. Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes the brain function, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul. The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the time they created the final form of the human race. Fik’r was not used in the early seven prototypes of the creation of mankind according to the Sumerian texts. Although the “Fik’r” is the primordial source of life for our physical body, it is not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is the physical description of our"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers and sequences of what there in our body, the data and history of our genes, genetic origin, ethnicity, race, so on. Thus Fik’r includes DNA. The Honorable Ulema said: “Consider Fik’r as a cosmic-sub-atomicintellectual-extraterrestrial (Meaning non-physical, non-earthly) depot of all what it constituted, constitutes and shall continue to constitute everything about you. And it is infinitesimally small. However, it can expand to an unimaginable dimension, size and proportions. It stays alive and continues to grow after we pass away, if it is still linked to the origin of its creation, in our case the Anunnaki. The Fik’r is linked to our creators the Anunnaki through a “Conduit” found in the cells of the brain. For now, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble. After death, this bubble leaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as the bubble leaves the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"body. The body dies because the bubble leaves the body. Immediately, with one tenth of one million of a second, the molecule or the bubble frees itself from any and everything physical, including the atmosphere, the air, and the light; absolutely everything we can measure, and everything related to Earth, including its orbit. The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to stand judgment and await the decision of God -whether you have to go to heaven or hell– because there is no hell and there is no heaven the way we understand hell and heaven. So it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist or a believer in any other religion. The molecule (Bubble) enters the original blueprint of “YOU”; meaning the first copy, the first sketch, the first formula that created you. Humans came from a blueprint, and each one of us has a Double. Your double is a copy stored in the “Rouh Plasma”."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"The Rouh-Plasma is an enormous compartment under the control of the Anunnaki, and can be transported to another star. And this double is immortal. In this context, the human being is also immortal, because its Double never dies. Once the molecule re-enters your original copy (Which is the original You), you come back to life with all your faculties, including your memory, but without physical, emotional and sensorial properties (The properties you had on earth), because they are not perfect.” Ulema Sadiq said: “At that time, and only at that time, will you decide whether you want to stay in your Double or go somewhere else, the universe is yours. If your past life on earth accumulated enough good deeds such as charity, generosity, compassion, forgiveness, goodness, mercy, love for animals, respect for nature, gratitude, fairness, honesty, loyalty, then your Double will have all the opportunities and reasons to decide and select what shape, format, condition you will be in, and where you will continue to live.”"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":" In other words, you will have everything, absolutely everything and you can have any shape you want including a brand new corporal form.

Worth mentioning here, that the molecule, (So- called soul in terrestrial term) enters a new dimension by shooting itself into space and passing through the “Ba’ab”, a sort of a celestial stargate or entrance. If misguided, your molecule (your so-called soul) will be lost for ever in the infinity of time and space and what there is between, until reconnected to your prototype via the “Miraya”.

Fikrama “Fikr-Rama”: Name of the human brain’s sixth wave, unknown yet to science. It can manifest itself as orbs during a séance. It is related to Anzalubirach, also known as Tarkiz; a mental training that develops a supernatural power. To fully understand what Kikrama “Fikr-Rama” means, we must first comprehend what An- zalubirach is, and how it works. Anzalubirach is an Ana’kh/Ulemite term meaning the following: a-Collecting thoughts, receiving and sending multiple mental images via brain wave synchronization, to improve mental and physical health; b-Using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phases and practices of Tarkiz. Tarkiz means a deep mental or intellectual concentration that produces telekinesis and teleportation phenomena. Sahiriin and Ulema’s students learn this technique in various forms. Basically it works like this:"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"a-The students use their Conduit (Which is located in the brain’s cells) to control the waves of their brains (First level of learning). b-The students concentrate on an object hidden behind a screen or a divider made from thin rice paper.

The brain is constantly producing different types of frequencies, waves, and vibrations, and transmitting messages reflecting our mental activity, feelings, thoughts, and state of consciousness or mind. Thus, the brain waves are divided in four states or categories called: 1-Beta, 2-Alpha,"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"3-Theta, 4-Delta. In addition to Betha, Alpha, Theta, and Delta waves, the Anunnaki Ulema developed a sixth wave called Fikr-Rama. It is neither measurable nor detectable, because it does not emanate from the physical brain. It is triggered by the Conduit situated in the brain’s cells. No science on Earth can direct us to the exact position of the Conduit. The Ulema said: 1- Through the mechanism of the Conduit, the enlightened ones regulate mind’s waves and frequencies. 2- The Fikr-Rama allows them to enter other dimensions, solid substances and matter. 3- The Fikr-Rama is a sort of a beam much lighter than laser.

Filfila is no exception. Perhaps the following excerpt from the Anunnaki-Ulema Kira’at- Dirassat, could elucidate the matter: “The meaning of the name of the great Perseus, founder of the Perseid Dynasty, and builder of the citadel of Mycenae is: “The Place of the Mushroom”, and various illustrations of the mushroom appeared abundantly on churches’ columns and inside the magical square of mediums and psychics. Another striking example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedek that appeared on a façade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding a chalice in the shape of a mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the Holy Grail, as interpreted in the literature of the Cathars, the Knights Templar,"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"and many enlightened eastern secret societies. It was also interpreted as the “Divine-Human Vessel”, meaning the womb of Virgin Mary; the very womb that gave birth to Jesus. In ancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to the Anunnaki, the mushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of the female. More precisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of life and all living creatures. This fecundity source came in the form of a mitochondrial DNA. The secret extracted liquid of the mushroom represented the “Light Liquid” known also as Elixir of Life, often called in the ancient Middle East as the “Shiraab al Sahiriin” (Juice or Syrup of the sorcerers and lightworkers). Like the Zaafaran, the Shiraab was used by Sahiriin and Noble Lightworkers to write magical talismans, and the secret powerful names of the Supreme Beings on the Burqah, and inside the “Magical Square”."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"By using the invisible light liquid, only the spirit could read the Talabaat and the Istibabaat, and thus communicating with spirits, angels and entities was channeled through magical words and sentences invisible to the naked eyes.

These three words (Meaning a rose, or a flower) in ancient linguistic context, symbolized the blooming of life, and the flux of supernatural power. At one point in history, the mushroom’s figure was used by the Templiers de Saint Jean (Templar Order of St. John of Malta) as the symbol of the Holy Grail.

This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not end when pets die. II. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets? Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility of contacting deceased people or animals, they have explained to us that contacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, and only during the 40 days period following their death.

III. When your departed loved pet returns to see you: I remember very vividly what the loving and Honorable Ulema Li has said to a novice who rushed to him in tears, and begged him to bring back to life, his dog who had died that morning. This happened some sixty years ago. Here is the story. My loving teacher asked the little Murad (Name of the novice): When did your dog die? Murad: This morning Master, please bring him back to me! Master Li: I can’t do that son, but how about if I let you see him one more time? Murad: Oh Master, I will do anything for you,"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"anything. Master Li: You know son, you dog is not dead. He is somewhere else now and he is very happy. Murad: Master, I buried him this morning under the tree. He is dead, he is dead! Master Li: Ok then, l will let you see him one more time, but do not touch him, do you understand? Just look at him, you can talk to him, but do not touch him. If you touch him, Poof, he will disappear. Note: By then, many students were alerted to what was going on and rushed to sit on the floor at the feet of the Master, excited and curious, they kept looking at the Master and I could hear them saying Master, please one more miracle, because they were accustomed to see the Master doing extraordinary things. An indescribable deep silence threw its heavy coat over the little students... and we were waiting... And all of a sudden, Murad screamed: Ahhhh...he is scratching my legs...he is licking my right foot...he is here...I feel him...Where is Master? Where is he, please tell me...I want to see him. None of the students –including myself– saw or felt"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"anything. Only Murad. Then, a thin layer of white dust began to take shape. And suddenly the dust was transformed into a substance like fluffy white cotton, and finally the face of a small dog began to appear, and seconds later, his whole body became visible to all of us. Murad got so excited and so happy...and not remembering what the Master has told him, rushed to hug his dog. And this was a grave mistake. Because as soon as he touched the face of his dog, the dog vanished in thin air. What Murad did upset everybody, and we hated him for that! Obviously Murad is in state of shock now. He did not know what to do or what to say. He dropped on the ground, and almost fell in a coma. The dog never returned again. With an austere serenity, the Master was watching everything, and everybody. Then, almost in a perfect synchronization, the students shouted: Master! What happened? And very calmly, the Master said: “You never touch the body of the dead before he rises to a higher dimension.” None of us understood what he"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"meant. We kept on asking more and more questions, but the Master in a firm voice said: “The Dirasa did not start yet!” (Dirasa means the lesson or the study.) Two months later, the Master nicely surprised us with a lesson on Gensi-uzuru. Obviously, he did not forget how interested we were in learning more about what has happened to Murad’s dog. Everybody was excited beyond belief. And this is what the Master had to say: IV. Excerpts from Master Li’s Kira’at on Gensi- uzuru: The Anunnaki love their pets very much. They treat them with love and respect. They do not consider them animals, but friends who just look different. You too, all of you, should love and care for you pets. Your pets feel with you, and know if you love them or you don’t."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Your pets can even protect your health and some other time, I will tell you more about it. When your pets die, they don’t forget you. Like all of us, they remember their good friends. And believe me when I tell you, they will try to come back, because they want so much to be with you again. Unfortunately, this is not possible. However, and because of the great love you had for your pets, they will keep on trying and trying. Pets are like humans...after they die, they don’t understand what is happening to them. They become very confused. But this happens to your pets during two weeks only. The two weeks after they have died.

It is not difficult if you pay attention. I am going to explain to you. First, what they do is this: Because they are no longer in a physical substance,(Physical form), and because they don’t know what is happening them, they approach you very slowly. They are confused, but they recognize you. They still remember where they were before. They remember your home, you, and the toys they played with; the ones you gave them. So, they come toward you slowly slowly, and gently will lean against your legs, or touch your legs like a whisper, like a child’s"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"caress. Unfortunately, very very very few people notice that. And sadly enough, your pets’ desperate efforts to contact you and let you know that they here around you are almost never felt. So, they dissipate, because they run out of energy. Remember, they can’t last for more than 4 seconds. But they don’t give up. They will try one more time. Only one more time. After that, they are gone for ever. Now listen to me carefully. While you are not aware of their invisible existence around you, things are still happening, and you can be part of it. You can still make some small arrangements, and mentally and emotionally prepare yourself to feel them when they return. And you will succeed. So what you have to do is this: Go fetch their toys. All of them if possible."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"Put them in their favorite area, where they used to play with their toys or preferred to lay down. Sit on the floor around the toys. Remember, you can’t call your dead pets. You can’t communicate with them. But they will communicate with you and will return to see you for the last time. Bring their food and water bowls, and put them next to their toys, as if they were still alive. Don’t ask why, just do it. Stay there for sometime. Twenty minutes should suffice.

He lived a long life, 1513-1609, and defended his people valiantly against their enemies. His followers loved him so much they called him \"The Exalted One.\" Even to a holy man, or a great mystic, creating life is forbidden.

The white stone is used for the protection of the Saher or Taaleb.

Introduction: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is one of the most powerful magical writings known to Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. Allamah Bin Thabet Al Ansari said, “It is a double edged sword, because the Taaleb can use it for both good and evil. It is powerful and dangerous placed in the wrong hands. It is a blessing in the hands of the righteous ones.” Well, what he meant is this: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a very effective magical tool to summon and command bad spirits and good spirits. If used with good intentions, the Taaleb’s requests will be answered by good spirits and entities, and guardian angels. They will manifest in the flesh, and grant lots of favors. Now, if the Taaleb summons bad spirits and entities like Ghoolim and Afrit, these malevolent spirits will also manifest in the flesh, and of course will grant the Taaleb many favors, but there is a high price to pay for this. First, “the bad spirits could steal a part of your Nefs, and control it for a very long time. This happens when the Taaleb is a beginner."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":" The Sahiriin masters can control and fully command the bad spirits without risk. But could you?” said the Honorable master Suleiman Tarek bin Ziyad. He added, “Secondly, once your Talaabat are granted, you create an alliance with the Fasidiin and the lower level of Arwaah. This means, that the bad Arwaah will also be entitled to ask you favors in return, such as entering the bodies of other people, usually innocent people and frightened souls (Human souls).” II. What is Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra? Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a magical circle that contains the names of angels and malevolent spirits, the Taaleb can summon and communicate with. It is frequently used by the Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin for multiple purposes, including but not limited to: a-Asking favors from the angels, all sorts of favors, big and small. b-Removing obstacles that halt or prevent"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"success in business, and relationships. c.-Closing the Madkhal of bad spirits who manage to enter the world of the living. d-Communicating with spirits trapped in the doomed zone. e-Guiding the trapped souls of dead people who cannot get out of the doomed zone. f-Cleansing areas and spots that are causing sickness, diseases and bad luck. The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin believe that there are spots and regions on Earth considered to be unhealthy and unlucky spots. People who live in those areas will never succeed in life, and their health could be seriously damaged. They also believe that on Earth, there are areas that bring good health and good luck to people. And so on. III. Names of angels mentioned in Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra: a. Jarmihyabeel b.

In the past, we called it the double. In this particular situation, it is wiser to call it your guide, because during your journey to the other world - not afterlife yet - your physical body will remain on earth, and there is no body per se to refer to. No physical substance can enter non- physical sphere. No human voice can reach the ear of non- physical entities. No human voice or any sound produced on"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"earth is heard in other dimensions.

But not physical sensations and corporal feelings. While your physical body is still quite alive but dormant in the physical surroundings (It could be your home, your office, your car, etc.), your Double retains all the faculties your brain and body received at the moment of your birth. Of course, your knowledge will increase considerably throughout the ages as you enter school, universities, and as you begin to learn from your teachers and tutors. We call this kind of knowledge “Earth’s Knowledge”.

Once the Conduit is activated by your teacher, you, (the student) become “Mounawar” (Enlightened). - Note: Mounawar is the singular of Mounawarin. - Without an activated Conduit you cannot communicate with your “Double”.

No harm is going to happen to your body. It will stay where it is, only your “Other Self” will change. Once, your Conduit is activated - better to say open – your mind begins to see new things...no, you are not hallucinating at all... you are only experiencing and seeing new things, called “Rou’yah” (Visions).

Where are you? In this state, you will be confused, but it is not going to last long. Your brain is reprogramming itself. (Note: The Honorable teacher did not use the word “Programming”, but that is the most a propos word I can use to explain to you what he meant.

It starts like this: The world beyond; the afterlife: This is what you will see first, when you enter the dimension of the other world: 1-Many layers of light dispersed as wide, and as far as you can see. 2-The shades appear fourth dimensional. 3-You are acquiring now an extra visual dimension.

This is your first reaction...fear! 6-Your mind will readjust itself, and in a blink of an eye, your fear will dissipate. 7-Your mind is telling you now that you are no longer on earth. 8-Your mind will reassure you that you are safe and no physical harm will come to you, because you are pure mind, but this mind is the ultimate reality. 9-Your Double will stand straight, right before your eyes. 10-And all of a sudden, faster than the speed of light, you’re zoomed into your Double. 11-Your Double and “You” are united. From now on, there are no more “You”, the person who lived on earth, and the other one (Your"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Double) that lives in the other dimension.

So close and so near to everything you knew and saw on earth. Yet, you are not physical. Your Double looks exactly like you on the outside. It has the external physical looks of the body you had on earth, but it is transparent, and light like ether. And you are in full control of this new body. 13-You will be able to remember all the places you have visited, all the things you liked and disliked. You will be able to visit any part of the world instantly. 14-You might experience strange feelings, such as falling so fast toward earth or an abyss, or being suspended in air and you don’t know what to do next.

And you continue to enjoy everything you are seeing"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"and what you can do next. 15-Some like to go back and visit their body; the one they left on earth. In fact, many do. Try it. Just command your new body to take you there. And there you are hovering over your body. 16-You begin to gaze at your body. Irresistibly you come closer to your physical body laying there motionless. And a new sensation invades you; you pity this mortal, weak, motionless, insignificant piece of flesh and bones. And all of a sudden, you understand that your physical body has a minimal value. And you will realize, that what really counts is your mind. IV.

The Ulema have explained in their teachings, that human life does not end on earth. Although the physical body decays, the mind continues to live in another dimension. The Judeo-Christian-Muslim tradition uses “soul” instead of mind. The Ulema believe that the soul is one of the many manifestations of the mind, although the soul does not manifest itself in any form or shape, not even in an etheric or ethereal sense. Buddhism also uses mind instead of soul.

Your Double that co-existed with you in your physical dimension was never physically attached to your body. In many instances, sometimes for a very long period, your “Double” has remained distant from your physical body for many reasons. But in general, your “Double” stays very close to you. The distance separating your Double from your physical body depends on your health condition. It is very healthy and even necessary to keep your Double at a close proximity of your body. Miraculous recoveries are sometimes attributed to divine intervention. Sudden recoveries are sometimes attributed to a strong will and one’s determination to be healthy again. And of course, there are other inexplicable recoveries which are attributed to other inexplicable events and phenomena. Everything is possible. But the"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"main reason for a sudden and inexplicable recovery is the sudden re-entry of your healthy Double in your physical body. It reactivates and energizes everything in your body. It is like recharging a dead battery. Your Double knows very well how your body functions, far more and better than any physician. Because the physical condition of your body at the time you relinquish your last breath is paramount, the passage to another dimension is henceforth influenced and altered accordingly. For example, people who die in a brutal accident or commit suicide, their Double becomes instantly impaired and dysfunctional at the time of their death. Suicide is wrong. No matter how miserable is your life, you should never commit suicide. Tragic death and suicide confuse and disorient your Double. Disorienting your Double is harmful to your"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"mind. And because your mind is your vehicle to the other world, you should avoid anything or anyone that could cause you a tragic, painful and sudden death. The body has its wounds. The mind has wounds too, but you can’t see them. Your Double does. If you leave earth in that condition, your mind will not lead you toward the Ba’ab. You will be disoriented. If you have not caused your own death, but suffered a lot at the time of your death, and your Double was far away from you, your passage to the other world will not be pleasant at all. And the Ba’ab will not be open right away to allow you to enter the other side of the world. Of course, eventually you will pass through, but not before 40 tumultuous and painful days you will spend lost and confused in the realm of confusion and loneliness. In normal situation such as a death of a natural cause, the passage to the other world"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"takes its normal course, at the end of the Double’s self-judgment and assessment of deeds, actions and thoughts of the deceased. Kabari-Nizaam: It is composed of two words: a-Kabari, which means dimension; a sphere of existence. b-Nizaam, which means a cosmic order; a cosmic law; justice. The general meaning is one’s accountability; responsibility at the end of his or her life on Earth. The concept; explanation: This concept was explained during an Ulema’s Kiraat (Readings; lectures), and a Q&A session. During an Ulema’s reading, a student asked the teacher this question: a-What happens to a bad person when he dies and right before he reaches the Ba’ab? (A sort of stargate; an entrance to another dimension; the other world; the afterlife.)"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"The honorable teacher replied: (Note: Verbatim, word for word. Translated according to the original reading, and preserving its authentic caché.) The “Nizam” (Cosmic Order and Law) tells us, that nobody escapes the final judgment. Each one of us is responsible for his/her acts, deeds, thoughts, even intentions. The principle of accountability is “Da.Em” (Perpetual). Eventually, all people will be saved at the end. There is no such thing as hell where human flesh and bones are burned by an eternal fire. Through the Ba’ab, the good person will be admitted to the grace and beauty of a higher dimension of happiness and peace. The bad person will not be allowed to enter the Ba’ab right away. When a bad person dies, he immediately"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"faces his Double. In this instance, the Double acts as a conscience and as a judge. The entire life flashes before his mind as a holographic sequence of events, deeds and thoughts. It is a large screen of his entire life. Everything he did in his life on earth is projected on this screen. Because he was a bad person, he will not be allowed to enter the Madkhal (Entrance to the other world). His double will stop him right there. He will be punished according to the gravity of his acts and thoughts. This bad person could spend thousands of years in a state of confusion, loneliness, fear, anguish, mental pain and suffering. The mental pain is as real and as atrocious as a physical pain. There is no escape. The bad person will spend those very long years in a sphere inhabited by chaos, horrific entities and psychosomatic pain,"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"even though, he does no longer possess a physical body. All the properties of his physical bodies are transferred to his mind in this new sphere , and as a result, he will suffer physically through his mind. And as a punishment, he will feel the same pain and suffering he caused to others. As I told you before, there is no physical hell in the afterlife. But as I see it, this sort of punishment is more painful than burning in fire. Because his Double is partially responsible, the Double will suffer too. Consequently, the deceased bad person will not be united with his Double. The separation between the deceased bad person and his Double will last for many years, as long as it takes to rehabilitate him and purify his past deeds and thoughts. Once the rehabilitation is complete, and the bad person has been totally purified, he"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"unites with his Double and loses his psychological (Psychosomatic) senses of the physical properties of his body. Thus the pain ceases. From the Madkhal he reaches the Ba’ab that takes him to a higher dimension; a sphere of tranquility, beauty, and eternal peace. However, this sphere is not perfect, because it is the lowest of the seven other dimensions that constitute the final and eternal destinations of the human existence. As we progress mentally (Spiritually to others), we reach higher and higher dimensions. The highest sphere we can reach is the Six dimension. The Seventh dimension is the “Malakout” (Almost same word in Hebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Syriac and Arabic, Ana’kh, and it means kingdom or paradise), where the Supreme Energy (God or the"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Original Force of Creation) originated, exists, lives, and extends infinitely. Another student asked the honorable teacher this question: b-What happens to a person who is not bad, but not a very good person when he dies and right before he reaches the Ba’ab? The honorable teacher replied: (Note: Verbatim, word for word. Translated according to the original reading, and preserving its authentic caché.) At the moment of death, he will be guided by his Double to a neutral sphere”where he will spend 40 days of purification. During those 40 days, he will receive guidance and orientation from his “Double”. Because he was not a bad person, at the end of the 40 days period, and right before going through the Ba’ab, he will be allowed to revisit the living he wishes to see one"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"more time. Also, he will be permitted to hover over places he wishes to visit for the last time. In some instances, the visited parents of the deceased feel his last apparition to them. Usually, the deceased appears to them in an ethereal form. It is not totally ectoplasmic, because at that stage, the deceased has already lost all the physical properties of his body. So his apparition is mental holography. The apparition does not last long. It fades way within a few seconds. And this is the last message (Sort of a Farewell), the parents will receive from him/her. After that last visit, no contact will ever occur again between the dead person and his/her loved ones. His/her mind (Soul to others) will leave earth for ever. Do not be duped by those who claim, that they can contact the dead and communicate with the spirits."},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":" Be aware of those fake spirits’ séances and channeling. Unless, the mind (Soul or Spirit to others) initiates a contact during particular stages, no living being on earth can communicate with the dead. Contact with dead people is possible, if the enlightened one has been granted the privilege to go through the Al Madkhal and the Ba’ab. On the last day of the 40 days period, the deceased is zoomed into his/her Double, and becomes one with his “Original Form”. The Original Form is what it created him/her. This is why we call it Double. The Double is the real persona of the human being. Everything we have in our body and mind came from our Double. Even though, some of our mental and physical faculties and properties are usually damaged on earth for various reasons, such as illness, malnutrition, fear, prejudices, tortures, confusion, etc., the original"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"faculties in our Double are immune, because the physical cannot affect the non-physical, nor reach any dimension beyond the “Zinar” (Belt of Earth). As soon as the deceased becomes one with the Double, the mind enters the Ba’ab on its way to the Fourth dimension. The Fourth dimension is a sphere so close to earth. And because the mind of the deceased in this dimension is capable of mental and spatial dilatation, quite often, the mind and the perimeter of the fourth dimension extend like an echo. It is through the extension of that echo, that contacts with the fourth dimension’s inhabitants are possible, but they are so rare. Almost, they never happen. Once, the mind (The deceased or visiting entity) enters the Fourth dimension, the deceased begins to see all sorts of things, shapes, colors, entities, human forms,"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"spiritual forms created by his/her memory.

Such a miracle is assumed to be performed either by God himself, by one of his angels, or by Elijah the Prophet.

These people performed what amounts to magic, despite the fact that Judaism had always objected to any form of it; the Bible even recommends killing all witches. But this did not stop the practitioners of practical Kabbalah from being wonder makers. The baalei shem maintained that they had secret knowledge of the holy Names, and that they could achieve supernatural results using them. The Name, holy Name, or Shem Tov (good Name) may be one of the divine Names, the name of an angel, or a combination of letters in those Names. Most people familiar with Judaism know the name of the Baal Shem Tov , the founder of the Hasidism. His real name was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer. A truly great scholar, he created a new philosophy, functioned as a religious leader, and performed miracles as a wonder-maker. Most of what we know about him is second hand, stories told by his disciples and later repeated for generations, much like Rabbi Hillel, Buddha ,"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"Socrates, and Jesus . The most famous book about him is Shivhei ha-Besht (Besht is the Hebrew acronym for Baal Shem Tov), a collection of stories that have been used in every book written about him. However, many people do not know that he was not the first to be the master of Names. Many of the stories in the book were borrowed from original tales about other \"baalei shem\" that had preceded the Baal Shem Tov. Scholars, particularly Gershom Scholem, proved that there was no difference between the words \"baal shem\" which means, \"master of the name\" and \"Baal Shem Tov,\" which means \"master of the good name.\" All names were good -- the baalei shem would not use them otherwise. They never performed anything even remotely negative like sorcery, black magic, or Satanism; the entire purpose of the wonders they performed was positive, and based on deep faith in traditional Judaism. The Names they used could be either spoken, or written on amulets made of paper or parchment. Baalei shem are not mentioned in the Bible. They"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"appear for the first time in the post-Talmudic period in Babylonia, or possibly at the beginning of the Geonim period, and the tales developed into the Middle Ages. The 16th and 17th centuries are extremely rich in stories, in both Israel and Europe. Kefitzat ha- Derekh is only one of the many wonders the “Baalei Shem” performed. They could preserve the bodies of the dead as \"dead-alive\" by placing written amulets in the bodies, to keep them for burial in the proper time and place. They could create golems exorcize demons and dybbuks protect people against their enemies on both land and sea, summon beasts from the spiritual realms, send and interpret dreams, and raise the spirits of the dead. Every process had its own formula and name, and those of kefitzat ha-derekh were different from all the others. The first known text to mention kefitzat ha-derekh, coupled with the personality of a baal shem, was a question sent by a North African community to Rabbi Hai Gaon."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"It described how a famous baal shem was seen in one place on the Eve on Sabbath (Friday). Later on the same Friday night, he was seen in another place, a distance of a few days journey. On Saturday evening, he was again seen back in the original place. There was no logical way to interpret the sightings, and the community wanted Rabbi Hai Gaon to explain the miracle. In his response, Rabbi Hai Gaon categorically denied the possibility of kefitzat ha-derekh; most rational rabbis did not want anything to do with these fanciful ideas.However, the population, greatly encouraged by the baalei shem, did believe in kefitzat ha- derekh. The concept appeared in many areas of the world. Southern Italy produced a particularly famous manuscript, Megillat Ahimaaz (also called Megillat Yuhasin).

These wonderful tales continued to develop until the traveling rabbis abandoned walking and riding in favor of technological progress; they started using fast ways of transportation, such as trains, to reach important destinations. As miraculous teleportation was no longer urgently needed, the telling of Kefitzat ha-derekh tales dwindled and eventually stopped. The demise of this myth is surprising, since there are such things as derailed trains, car accidents, and delayed planes. Why not have a miracle in a crowded airport, or while stranded on a lonely road in a stalled car?

The Ulema after years of study and practice, and following the instructions of the Book of Rama- Dosh, became capable of creating a sphere (Or zone) around them that resembles a halo. Some call this halo a “Bubble”. The halo surrounds their physical body. In the halo, exist molecules and particles charged with high atomic and sub-atomic density (No, not nuclear devices!), i.e. energy.

You have to remember, that everything in the universe is composed from molecules and particles. For instance, if you throw a punch at an Ulema, you put in your punch a certain amount of energy and physical effort. The energy and the physical effort are composed from molecules. These molecules are denser in their composition than the molecules floating around the Ulema, and thus cannot penetrate their halo and reach their bodies. This is why people can’t go through walls. Our bodies molecules need “to shrink” and “transmute” themselves into thinner vibrations, to allow us to go through walls.

And when, the nothingness of existence of all forms and substances suddenly collided with itself, the whole universe exploded into billions and billions of stars, galaxies, planets, and layers of dimensions. In some universes, the coagulation of time with the landscape of space created time.

The primordial intelligent life-form belonged to very advanced galactic races inhabiting billions of stars and planets. Billions of years later, the human race was genetically created by some of these very advanced intelligent life-forms, such as the Anunnaki, Igigi, and Lyrans. When pre-humans, proto-humans, and quasi- human began to populate the Earth, time did not exist at that point in history. Later, much later, when the Lyrans, Igigi, and the Anunnaki commenced to experiment with the archaic human species (They were 47 different categories), they installed in the brain of the human beings, some form of"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"intelligence. Some early humans were fortunate to receive the “Conduit”, the invisible cell in the brain that produces all sorts of human activities and thoughts. When the early human beings began to reason, the notion of time was conceived. Thus, “Time” became the invention of humans. Time exists on Earth, not on other dimensions. La-abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”: Is it a tool to go back in time or jump into the future? Is it physical or ethereal? The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin explain: No. Because, if you want to go back in time, and/or visit the future, you have to depart from this dimension (Earth), where you currently live. Once, you are outside the perimeter of the third dimension (Earth), time bends on itself."},{"pageNumber":583,"pageContent":"Space bends on itself. And you are caught in the middle. However, you can escape this dilemma, and realign yourself, following the cadence/rhythm of all dimensions beyond the third one. How, will you accomplish this? We will elaborate on this, when we study the “Parallel Synchronization.” Since time does not exist, the enlightened ones (Many of you are enlightened) will be able to watch themselves living separately in different worlds. This is what La abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu” does. It allows you to “see” not to revisit the past or jump into the future, unless your “Conduit” is fully activated. Once you are outside the physical realm (Earth), you immediately connect with the beginning of everything in the universe. You become part of “God’s Particle.” However, and as we have explained before, revisiting the so-called past is possible if"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"you use the Gomatirach Minzari. But bear in mind, you are not visiting, but transposing yourself, unless your “Conduit” is fully activated. 5. Can I use the “La-abrida” to ameliorate my life, and change my destiny? “Yes,” said Ulema Kanazawa. He added, verbatim: “However, you cannot alter the laws of cause and effect; something similar to what you call Karma, but in reality, it is quite different from Karma, because there is no place for reincarnation in the world of the Anunnaki. There are Anunnaki’s norms that remain universal wherever you go, although they are norms per se, but not necessary cosmic laws. On Earth, you are accountable for all your actions. The same applies in all the dimensions, realms, and spheres of time, and space. However, in a different form of existence, or dimension, the nature and understanding of certain moral and ethical laws might change"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"considerably. Such change has a paramount effect on the level of enlightenment and happiness you wish to reach. On Earth, we have what we call the human law, the natural law, and dogma establishing acceptable behavior in societies and communities. These laws quite often change in virtue of our understanding of what is right, and what is wrong. They also change, as time changes, as our form of government changes, as a majority’s power and influence change, regionally and nationally. Nothing is truthfully permanent on Earth. In the galactic perimeter of advanced and “spiritual” communities, values do not change. They are permanent and universal, and they govern the general conduct of life- forms and intelligent entities, in the entire universe. If you enter a particular dimension, far away from Earth, or too close to Earth, you might"},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"encounter social rules that are in sharp contrast with laws on Earth. This could confuse your mind, and prevent you from understanding and/or recognizing what is right, and what is wrong. If this should happen to you, you will not be able to ameliorate your life, and change your destiny, when you return to Earth, and/or to the present. Something else you should take into consideration. What kind of destiny, success, happiness, prosperity and advancement are you talking about? Are they those your are aiming at, upon returning to Earth, or those you are seeking after death? Or, possibly those that exist in a dimension close to Earth? The Anunnaki-Ulema can simultaneously live in two or three different dimensions, and coordinate their actions via the “Conduit”. We call this, the “Universal Conduit”."},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"Humans have not yet reached a level of morality and “spirituality” that allows them to live and relive in separate dimensions at the same time. Although, some humans might be invited to visit another dimension and acquire a great deal of knowledge, wisdom, and even supernatural powers, upon their return to Earth, they will instantly forget whatever they have learned, heard and seen, unless they are spiritually developed, and guided by the enlightened ones. Thus, in order to ameliorate you destiny, prosper in your endeavors, and preserve a good health, you must be able to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, at a galactic level. You must become acquainted with the universal truth; the galactic harmony of things. Truth in the “outer cosmos” is quite different from the truth you find on Earth. Only your activated “Conduit” will allow"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"you to do so. There also certain measures and requirements you must consider and comply with, before you leave Earth and enter another dimension, and/or time-space sphere. For instance, selecting the correct time to revisit the past, and/or another dimension is paramount. What “Ba’ab” (Door or entrance to the other world) shall you enter? How shall you adapt, correct or adjust your vision in a new dimension? How would you differentiate between an astral travel, imagination, fantasy of your mind, and reality? Even in highly developed dimensions, and in many different time/space spheres, you will encounter fantasy, tricks of the mind, hallucinations, and fake apparitions. Many of the other dimensions (Plans) and time-space spheres are similar to Earth, even though the structural composition and"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"their properties are enormously different. All these encounters, images and feelings will prevent your mind from understanding what you are seeing. You will be totally confused. For example, and let’s assume for now, that you have managed to go back in time, and visit with people and societies from the 18 th century. First, how would you know, that the people you will see there are indeed from the 18 th century, and not people just like you, visiting the past for the first time? Second, how would you guide yourself, direct yourself, and reach your destination, without getting lost? Bear in mind, that in a different dimension, you will not have enough time to find your way around, if you don’t have the map of the afterlife, and parallel dimensions. Third, you will not be able to last long over there, because your mind and your body will run out of energy."},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"Besides, do you know how to charge and/or recharge yourself? You will be facing incomprehensible situations similar to ectoplasmic apparitions. Quite often, these ectoplasmic apparitions and/or projections (Complete or partial) dissipate because the entity has rapidly consumed its “apparition and manifestation energy.” Once you have completed your orientation program, and the master has activated your “Conduit”, your trip to the past or to another dimension will be successful and very beneficial. 6. Revisiting your childhood in another dimension, in another time: Master Kanazawa explained this in one of his Kira’at (Readings). Here is what he said to his students, verbatim, word for word, and unedited: Copy of your childhood is still real and"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"vivid in another dimension. This image is still there. It is your image when you were a child. It is physical and real. Even the toys and candies you loved are still there, and they are real too. You can even touch those toys and play with them if you want. You can grab your favorite candies from the jar and eat one. Everything you see and taste is real. You are not hallucinating, and your mind is not playing tricks on you. How can you be so sure? It is simple, and very convincing, because upon meeting people you knew while you were child, you will be able to tell them how did they live and what they did when they were young like you, in the same town, around the same corner, and even describe to them the kind of games you played with them in the streets, in the school yard, and on the streets sidewalks."},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"You will be able to tell them what they did on that particular Sunday day, after the church service. But you will see it and enjoy it only once, because you might not be able to return once again to that dimension. Sometime, it is so easy to enter the extra- dimension of your youth, without training. Sometime, it happens, just like that, because you have escaped the gravity of time on Earth. It is a sudden opening into your past. A past you have lived here on Earth, and was duplicated somewhere else. Now, you are revising that “somewhere else”, and nobody is going to recognize it, except you. You will recognize all the people you will be seeing and meeting in that “somewhere elsewhere” dimension. But, they will not recognize you. Even though, you give them very particular and personal details about their lives, their"},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"habits, the place where they grew up, the name of that school teacher they like, of that math teacher they hated. Still, they will not believe that you are the one you claim or pretend to be; a friend from their youth, a real friend from your past, or their past; a past you really shared with them. But remember, there is always one person who will believe you. And he is always around you. Perhaps, it is the other copy of yourself, or your guardian angel? You will have the chance to meet that “other copy of yourself” in some other time, and somewhere else...in another dimension. The name of the store you are revisiting now in that dimension has not changed. Perhaps, only the name of the proprietor did. Because the former owner was already too old, and he passed away some twenty years ago. You used to come to that store, sit on the"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"stool, and talk to Mr. Ted, the old owner of the store. “Mr. Ted passed away long time ago,” will tell you the man standing behind the counter in the store. But the truth is, Mr. Ted is somewhere else now, exactly as you are somewhere else, in other dimension. Something very strange will happen to you in that dimension. You could see yourself as a child riding that beautiful old carousel. Or perhaps chasing an old car. Those images are real. Because you will recognize them in their most intimate details. Some other people will agree with you when you describe to them the carousel you loved, the kind of cars people drove in that small town, and the name of those teachers you have mentioned. Yet, they will never believe you when you tell them, that you grew up here, how you used to chase that old Impala Chevrolet of Mr. Evans, and those treasured comics"},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"books you bought from Mrs. Adams, who used to own the little bookstore around the corner. It is up to you to believe what you are seeing or to totally reject it. But if you reject it, you will never be able to revisit your youth, and other worlds, small towns, and cities you lived in before. You begin to ask yourself, how did you get there? How did you get here in the other dimension? You start to question your sanity. But you know deep down, you are not dreaming, and you are not hallucinating, because the people you see are real, and they walk and they talk like real people. Only their hairdo has changed, the fashion of their clothes is old, old enough to send you back in time. The cars you see are old too, they are 1930’s model. And the calligraphy style of the names of the shops on windows and doors is old too."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"So what are you going to do in that strange place? You put your hands in your pockets, and you will find dimes and nickels. Because that was all what you needed to buy an ice cream or a candy. Then you begin to wonder why people do not believe you. You have told them true stories about people they knew, stories about you and your parents, and about everything you saw and you did when you were a child in that town. It is very likely, you will meet your parents before they were married. You will recognize your mother, or at least your mother to be. You call her by her name, her maiden name and her married name. You will scare her, and she will think you are insane. How would you or could you convince her you are her child? How would you convince her that she was the mother who fed you, who clothed you"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"and took you to the movie house “Rex” with your sisters, and kept on telling you to keep quiet while watching the movie, because you talked too much. You tell her all this, yet, she will not believe you. But just before you leave her, she feels something she can’t explain. These encounters and deja vu experiences happened to many people before. If you anchor them in your mind, in your “Conduit”, you will be able to return and visit with them once again, but it will happen in a different dimension. A dimension, where your mother is no longer your mother, but possibly your date, or just another woman? Confusing? You bet. But this is what constitutes the fabric of time and space in other dimensions. A time and a space that cease to exist in that dimension. A dimension not very far from where you currently live."},{"pageNumber":598,"pageContent":" 7. The invisible quantum line dividing two space- time dimensions: The Honorable Anunnaki-Ulema Master said: The invisible thin quantum line dividing two times capsules, both located on the same plane, is usually the outer limit of two dimensions. These two time-space dimensions are usually found in isolated areas, such as distant valleys, fields, and spots on Earth, rarely visited by the public. The two time-capsules represent two different time intervals and all past events that occurred separately in each one of them. Even sounds from past eras can be heard separately, coming from each one of them. You can’t see the diving line. It is not visible to the naked eye. If you cross that line, you leave the time you are living in, and you enter a different time- space. This is the time and space where you can"},{"pageNumber":599,"pageContent":"change the past, but rarely does it happen, unless in previous times, you were part of the past, and/or have witnessed these events from the past. For instance, you are in 1974, on one time- capsule section of the land (Field, desert, spot). You cross the line separating 1974 and another year, perhaps hundreds of years. You cross the line and you enter another time without knowing it. Once in, you become part of the past, and a real person from the past. You are as real as all the physical things you see before your eyes. The events or scenes you will see are usually memorable, meaningful, historical, or important events known to you. You are very familiar with what you are currently seeing. They appear from nowhere, and since you have become part of the past, these events become factual."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"Part of your mind will tell you that you know a lot about these events, because you have read about these events, but you can’t remember where and when. Another part of your mind convinces you that you are seeing the true events as they have happened, or you are seeing the events for the first time. This is a moment of confusion for you. But eventually you will sort it out. Is it a mirage? A hallucination? A fantasy? Or the real thing? Well, if you have stepped in the true time-capsule sphere, then, what you are seeing is real, and what you are feeling is not psychosomatic but truly physical. Many people have reported that some of their friends have vanished walking this dividing line. And the missing persons were never found, because they have entered another dimension, never to return again. In the Anunnaki’s “Donia” (Spheres; world), there is no hallucination, coincidence,"},{"pageNumber":601,"pageContent":"fantasy, or psychosomatic effects. Everything is tested and real.

You will relive the events and time of that dimension. If at the time, when you were transported, a battle was going on, you become one of those men who are fighting in this battle. Each scene that appears before your eyes will blend you in its fabric and time-reality, and you will not be able to escape its boundaries. How real are these events? They are real 100%.

It is hard, even impossible for humans to understand this mystery. But it is happening for real in another dimension. Yes, you could die in that dimension, but you are still alive in another one, because all of us live simultaneously in different dimensions. Probably now you are asking whether the person who died in that battle is in fact the same person who is still alive in 1978 or 1979 or even in the future. And my answer is yes. You are all these persons in all these capsule-time spheres. You are the same person, but the properties of your body are different, as dictated by each dimension respectively.

You look at yourself and you realize that you are wearing clothes of the era. Yet, part of your mind that has retained space-time memory will tell you that you are living real events and real time, but you are just visiting another time and space in history. Then, if this is the scenario, can you go back to where you came from? Yes, you can. One way to do it is by using the Gomatirach- minzari, and similar techniques. (Note: See Gomatirach-minzari, on page 83 in the book “Ramadosh Book; 13 Anunnaki-Ulema Mind Power Techniques to Live Longer, Happier, Healthier, Wealthier.) 8: Q&A: At the end of Master Kanazawa’ Kira’at (Reading/Lecture), a young student asked the Master: “Master, it is possible to bring with me, something from that dimension I have visited, so when I tell my friends about it they would believe me?”"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"“Of course you can,” replied the Master. “And this is how many ancient artifacts were brought back to the present. Some ended in the basements of museums, others dissipated in the doubtful minds of humans who could live only once.” Another young student asked Honorable Master Kanazawa: “Master, you told us that sometimes, we enter a different dimension without knowing how to do it. You said, it happens just like that. Why? And if this happens just like that, then our “Conduit” does not need to be activated to visit other worlds?” The perplexed student paused for a short moment, and asked again: “Master, when we get there, do we go to different levels in the same dimension, or is it one single dimension we see all the time? And how many different worlds can we visit in a single trip to the past or to other dimensions?” The Honorable Master replied (As is, verbatim, word for word, and unedited): Everything depends on how your brain is wired."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"If your “Conduit” has been activated, then, you will know and understand what is happening to you, and all the things you will see in the other world(s) will be assimilated gradually by your brain. To understand what it is actually happening there, and how you got there, you have to visualize your mind as a tall building with many floors. Inside the building, there is an elevator that goes all the way to the highest floor. There is only one single elevator for all the people who enter the building. Each floor represents one layer of that dimension (The other world). This does not mean that the dimension you have entered has sub-divisions or additional dimensions. Simply put, the dimension is divided into multiple spheres, called layers. Each sphere gathers different kinds of people, eras, knowledge, events, memories, sensations, cars, shops, streets, so on.

There are two kinds of entrances to another world. The first one occurs through the activation of your “Conduit”. And you know already how this happens. The second kind of entrance to another world is the accidental one, which is the current situation you are in. Usually, the coincidental or accidental entrance to another world occurs from spots and areas on Earth, that are not heavily visited or frequented.

In our Ana’kh language, we call them “Ba’abs” (Doors, entrances, time tunnels, etc.) When the “Ba’ab” accidentally opens up, a huge but narrow tunnel appears before you. This tunnel takes the form of a spiral-wind; a sort of an atmospheric turbulence. You will see it. You will feel its electro-magnetic field, and before you know it, you are sucked up by its current. Once inside the tunnel, your will start to feel as if your body is shrinking. Sometime, just the opposite. You will feel as if your body is stretching out intensely. Everything depends on the intensity of the tunnel’s vacuum power.

The time-space plates, although invisible to the naked eye, exist at the entrance and borders of all dimensions existing in the universe. You can consider them as the landmark(s) of multiple universes. When the plates collide, or bump into each other, a time/space-vacuum tunnel opens up immediately.

Now, you are inside the tunnel. Your body zooms inside the tunnel at the speed of light. This incomprehensible speed allows you to travel to the edge of the universe.

Certainly, neither Egypt or Paris, or anything else you saw on other floors. It is going to be another country.

The most common one is the Gregorian Calendar, which is a reflection of the Christian faith. It is younger than the Muslim calendar, which in turn, is younger than the Jewish calendar. All of these are considerably younger than the Anunnaki calendar, which is the only one used by the Anunnaki-Ulema. The Anunnaki-Ulema and Rouhaniyiin reject the idea that the week consists of seven days."},{"pageNumber":667,"pageContent":"Their week consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of our week. These are the only days to use in this technique, and the other three days in our week should not be calculated upon. The Ulema-Anunnaki and Mounawariin’s days are: Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday) Day 2: Araba (Wednesday) Day 3: Jema (Friday) Day 4: Saba (Saturday). The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and the hours in each day. Using the calendar of the Anunnaki-Ulema, each person can find the luckiest hour of his or her week, according to the Book of Ramadosh (Rama- Dosh). Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week is not sufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at work if it occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday. This predicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique, Time Manipulation, on that exact hour. The time that will"},{"pageNumber":668,"pageContent":"be added to your life under such circumstances will be as lucky as the original hour, and your chances of success will be vastly improved.” The Rouhaniyiin and Mounawariin teachers highly recommend performing a combination of techniques, since each enhances the other considerably. The calendars’ grids: A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, are all people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour? Yes, indeed they would. There are only sixteen grid lines to represent millions of people each. And this leads to an interesting discovery. The numbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony that exists between them. For example, if you wish to approach someone in high places for a favor, finding that he or she shares the number of letters and the lucky hour will enhance your chances. Always send your request to him or her during the lucky hour, either by calling on the phone, using"},{"pageNumber":669,"pageContent":"your e-mail, or placing a written letter in the mailbox. The use of a language: Another question is the issue of languages. What if your name is written with four letters in America, where you live, but with five letters in your native language? The answer is simple. Always use your native language, the language that you were first aware of your name in, in your grid. It will be much more accurate and certainly more powerful. An important fact to add is that this technique is simple, but it can be enhanced in many ways by subtle variations. Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space is related to luck and success, and how to fine tune the process. But even in this straightforward version, the technique is incredibly powerful, so much so that it may change your life completely, always for the better.

The unseen world is their habitat, and it is an immense world full with spirits and entities. Some entities want to enter the world of the living and create a rapport with us. They have their own agenda. One way to do it is to invade our zone, the space defined by the Khateyn Tarika. This zone is their gateway and passage to our bodies and mental faculties.

And the door becomes wide open to a fleet of uninvited bad spirits. They enter one after another, unchallenged and head towards our bodies. You can call this possession.

These things are the very disturbing manifestations of the entities. Financial worries, fear, constant failures, addiction to drugs, and emotional suffering disrupt the peace in our body’s zone. They register on the 2 lines of Khateyn Tarika. The healthy colors of the two lines begin to deteriorate, to weaken, and finally they distance themselves from our bodies.

And here we have two scenarios: Scenario one pertains to a case when we have summoned an entity not knowing that this entity is from the lower level. Entities from the lower dimensions move in groups. They are never alone. They jointly prey on people. As soon as one of them invades our weakened zone, all the other entities follow. The Bible, several religious scriptures, the Prophet Mohammad, and even Jesus Christ talked about a bunch of bad entities who simultaneously and jointly entered human bodies, and refused to leave. So, as you see, one bad entity always brings along several other entities.

Answer : The Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin have lots of powerful commands to dispose of the bad entities. You will find plenty of commands to repel and/or send away Afarit, and bad entities in volume one and volume two of this series. The Taaleb must memorize these commands. Some commands deal specifically with this or that entity. This is a very difficult and threatening situation. You can’t tell the bad entities “Hey buddy wait a minute, let me find the command in the book, so I can command and kick your ass out!!” This would be a big mistake. This is why I have insisted that beginners and adepts should and must know all these commands by heart. You will have no time at all to regain control of the situation, while making the entities wait, until you find the proper command. It would be too late. And as soon as one bad entity squeezes in, expect to see more malevolent spirits doing the same. Usuallu, such intrusion is accompanied by a horrible sulphuric odor."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"This is how we sense their presence when they do not manifest in the flesh. Ironically, the malevolent spirits enjoy this intoxicating smell. In fact, it is through this sulphuric odor that they follow each other. Of course, they do not need to smell each other to recognize each other, since they come from the same Kirba, meaning habitat. But the odor of one “squeezed in” Afrit or bad entity, is an open invitation to other entities to invade our weakened zone and possess our body. The awfully bad odor marks their territory. In this particular case, the territory is our weakened zone.

It was also said, that this 17 year period can alter a DNA sequence, thus preventing time from succumbing the blessed one to aging, and the deterioration of their cells. One of the last Mounawirin (Enlightened) known to have discovered the secret of the 17 lucky years was Alan Cardec “Allan Cardec” (October 3, 1804- March 31, 1869). Cardec’s real name was Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail. And his Ulema name was Asha-Kar-Da-Ki. His mentor was the legendary Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, also known as “Mirdach Kadoshi Sirah” in the Anunnaki-Ulema circle.

In fact, the word or term “Spiritism” was coined by Cardec. He was the first to use it and explain its application during a contact with a higher entity and other rapports with dead people (Trapped deceased persons) who asked for his help. Sometimes, it was the way around; Cardec asked for their guidance on matter related to life after death, and the realm of the next life. Master Cardec was the father of the French movement of Spiritism, and communications with entities trapped between the next dimension and Earth’s boundaries. They are called “Les retenus”, meaning those who were trapped in the afterlife dimension, or more precisely, those who were detained. Cardec was burried at the historical French cemetry Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise.

Gensi-uzuruis is associated with apparition of dead pets, and our communication with them during a very specific time period. The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin are very fond of animals. Extensive passages in the Book of Rama- Dosh speak about the important role animals play in the life of humans, especially at emotional and therapeutic levels. The Ulema believe that pets understand very well their human-friends (Instead of using the word “owners”). And also, pets communicate with those who show them love and affection. This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not end when pets die. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets? Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility of contacting deceased people or animals ad infinitum, they have explained to us that contacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, and only during the 40 days period following their death."},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"In other words, we can contact our pets, deceased parents and dear ones, or more accurately enter in contact with them if: a-They contact us short after their death; b-They must initiate the contact; c-This should happen during a 40 days period following their departure; d-Their contact (Physical or non-physical) must be noticed by us. This means that we should and must pay an extra attention to “something” quite irregular or unusual happening around us. Because our departed pets will try to send us messages, and in many instances, they do. e-We must expect their messages, and strongly believe in those messages. Communication with our pets: Pets can contact us via different ways, that we can sense if we have developed a strong bond with them. Pets know who love them and those who don’t, because pets feel, understand, sense and see our aura."},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"All our feelings and thoughts are imprinted in our aura, and the aura is easily visible to pets, particularly, cats, dogs, parrots, lionesses, pigs, and horses. This belief is shared by authors, people of science and therapists in the West, despite major difference between Westerners and Ulema in defining the nature and limits of pets- humans after death contact. Zoohoor and Baa rada hiwan: Baa rada means the company of, or being in the presence of. Hiwan means animals, more precisely domesticated animals; pets, such as dogs and cats. In the Sahiriin’s literature and esoteric practices, cats play a major role; a role that rotates around prediction of events to occur within a short period of time, and sensing danger. Cats are also considered a “Psychic Conduit” by Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. In fact, in some of their black magic Jalasaat (Séances), Sahiriin would bring in a cat to help sense, receive and send messages and predictions. The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions or"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"Predictions of the Cat) was very active in ancient Egypt and the Near East. On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin strongly recommend to adopt cats, and care for them, for they could be very useful to their owners; they are capable of sensing imminent dangers, catastrophes, mishaps, and above all, their instinctive nature leads them to warn their owners, little children, and people who love them against danger. Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A cat in the house is blessing.” Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if they bother to watch, study and understand their behavior. Quite often, cats stare at something the human eye can’t see. And in some instance, and for a few seconds, cats remain frozen in their attention upon looking at the unknown which seems to appear to them in etheric forms. The Sahiriin told us that these etheric forms could be spirits, the souls of dead people who are interested in the occupants of the house, dead little"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"girls and boys who can’t realize that they are dead now, and keep on playing with their toys and running right and left in particular parts of the house they used to live in; in our case, the current house of the cat who is staring at them. The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attention to the observing cat, to remain calm and patient, and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat is staring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat, and to take notes of the reaction of the cat. This exercise of ours should not stop there. We should keep on observing our cat, and taking notes, and above all to draw a map of the places in our home which seem to interest the cat and/or provoke the cat to sense the unseen; a map which could include more than one place in our home and locate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a web of openings, a sort of time-space vortices, or simply a “playground” for spirits. How do pet psychics communicate with animals? Jennifer Wallens, the world’s #1 pet psychic and animal communicator said, “I can say that I mostly use telepathy to communicate with the animals and"},{"pageNumber":751,"pageContent":"to tap into their world. Telepathy is the sending and receiving of information by way of words, feelings and images. I also use my ability to tune in psychically and hear words sometimes transmitted, as well as feel their emotions and pick up colors, medical conditions, and other issues. I do look at them physically and pick up on the body language as well. So for me it is a combination of using every ability and tool I have. Animals will sometimes first flash an image to me, and allow me to tune in to them and feel where their pain is, or what problem they are having, or if there is something they want, and they will show that item or activity as an image.” She added, “A funny example the other night happened when my little 10 year old toy poodle Tinkerbell, sat up in the bed looked straight at me after we got into bed, staring deeply at me, I looked at her, cleared my mind, and immediately saw a vanilla wafer in an image!

Well, needless to say I went back to the kitchen and brought back the special requested treat, much to their delight. It truly amazes me how incredibly intelligent they are and they are just waiting for us to catch up and realize they are communicating all the time, in their own way. I have developed my own technique which I may adjust according to the animal I am working with or whether I am with them in person. If I am there with the animal, I look at their reactions, and I always first lay a hand on them to comfort them and look into their eyes with out saying anything. I smile and send out loving energy to them and then ask telepathically what they would like to convey to me that I may tell their owner/family. If there is a problem I am aware of, I focus on the awareness of this issue and the solution to the problem, not just the problem. It is important to view everything from the same perspective of the animal to truly"},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"understand them. I wait for an image, feeling, emotion, or clairaudiently, words or phrases to begin the telepathic exchange. If I am not able to meet directly with the animal, then I can do this with photos of the animal and communication with their owner over the phone or SKYPE. It does not seem to make a difference in outcomes or results, as it seems I receive the same relevant helpful information in one way or another. I believe my guides are always helping me to connect with the animals. It doesn't hurt to call on St. Francis of Asissi for assistance as well. Asking Jennifer Wallens believes all animals have a soul, a spirit that as I have been told remains with us even into the afterlife. This \"soul\" is like our own, it retains its personality after death. I do believe in reincarnation and that this soul will come back again in another animal form.
