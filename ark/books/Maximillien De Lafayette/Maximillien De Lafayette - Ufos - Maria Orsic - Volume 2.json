Predicting the rise of a Nazi Germany : Being an extraordinary psychic, Maria in 1919, foresaw the rise of a NAZIGermany, and even predicted with utmost certitude that Adolf Hitler and HeinrichHimmler, one day, will rule Germany with an iron fist, and bring Germany to herknee.Worth mentioning here that in 1919, Adolf Hitler was a retired and bitterCorporal from the defeated German army that fought during World War One, and atthat time, was very preoccupied with investigating Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (German Workers' Party ).Ironically , Hitler became its leader, upon the recommendation of Anton Drexler,one of the founders of the party.On October 7, 1900 , Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich , and in 1919, hegraduated from high school in Landshut . It was not until August 18, 1923, thatHimmler joined the Nazi party.On January 6, 1929, Adolf Hitler appointed him Reichsführer SS, and in August1931, Himmler created the Sicherheitsdienst ; SD (The Security Service of theNazi Party).Thus, the concept and creation of Germany’s UFOs began years before Hitler andHimmler ascended to power.And what is so extraordinary about Maria’s prediction resides in the fact thatshe has discussed Adolf Hitler and Himmler in two meetings with her Ladies ofVril that occurred in 1919, and 1921.Following a “Labyrinth Channeling séance”, the Ladies of Vril expressed theirconcern about Hitler and Himmler, and the inevitable; meaning Himmler’sdomination over their Vril. Maria was absolutely sure that once Heinrich Himmlerbecomes aware of Jenseitsflugmaschine , he will exploit it as a military weapon,and if the Ladies of Vril will refuse to cooperate with him, he will shoot themon the spot. *** *** *** Before the meeting:Reconstruction of the discussions of the Ladies of Vril (A synopsis). Maria: Without backing and funds, we will never be able to build theJenseitsflugmaschine.Traute: I think we should wait and see what Dr. Schumann has to say.Traute: I think we should go ahead and meet with…Sigrun: Not a good idea. Without positive inputs from Professor Schumann ,nobody would listen to us.Maria : True. Correct. Otherwise we will look stupid.Does anyone here know how to explain the technical data?I don’t.Traute: How about meeting with other mediums?Some might know something about the script (Aliens’ messages).Heike: Wait a moment, why don’t you talk to your friends at the Theosophicalsociety? (Talking to Maria)Maria: G reat idea . I am sure somebody there could translate the script (Themessage received in old cuneiform inscriptions).Traute: I think that before meeting with anybody we must have a completetranslation of the script, a scientific explanation from Dr. Schumann, and hideit from everybody…All agreed. *** *** *** In order to build the Adelbaran’s spaceship:But in order t o accomplish this, many things had to be done: 1 - All the messages received in an unknown script must be accuratelytranslated. 2 -The images Maria received telepathically must be interpreted andexplained scientifically. 3 -Joint effort with other psychics/mediums and financiers to get thefinancing. 4 -Contact scientists and engineers to decipher and explain thetechnical data on how to build the spaceship , and especially theJenseitsflugmaschine ’s sketches. 5 -Secure financing from sources not affiliated with the authorities. 6 - Keep the whole project secret. *** *** *** TA1 [Image00002.jpg] TrauteThe Ladies of Vril Meeting s________________________________ Maria and the Lad ies of Vril had a total of five meetings with other groups,members of Thule and DHvSS ( Die Herren Vom Schwarzen Stein) , some of Germany’sdistinguished personalities and leading figures in various disciplines ,occupations and professions, including physicians, linguists, engineers,theorists, writers, philosophers, financiers, as well as politicians.All the meetings took place in Munich . They met to discuss the possibility of building a new kind of a super flyingmachine called Jenseitsflugmaschine, as well as other types of wonder-machines(These machines were discussed much later) which in ufology’s jargon arereferred to as UFOs. *** *** *** The First Meeting; Tuesday 16, September 1919 .Maria met with Professor Winfried Otto Schumann in a cafe on Arcisstraße, notfar from the Technical University of Munich.They had a preliminary discussion about a technical data on how to build a superflying machine , Maria Orsic received from extraterrestrials from Adelbaran.Maria asked him if he was interested in exploring the possibility of buildingsuch a machine.Dr. Schumann was very perplexed but did not reject the idea. He suggested toMaria to gather more data and any other pertinent information for furtherconsideration.It was a brief meeting but promising. *** *** *** The Second Meeting; Friday 19, September 1919.Maria met once again with Dr. Schumann and gave him a few pages which containeda script written in a language total ly unknown to her. Dr. Schumann recognizedpart of the script and told Maria that he will consult with Friedrich Delitzsch,a noted Assyriologist and expert on ancient languages. *** *** ***The Third Meeting ; Wednesday 17, December 1919 .Maria, the Ladies of Vril and Dr. Schumann met with other mediums, and membersof Thule and DHvSS ( Die Herren Vom Schwarzen Stein) in an old printing housenear Berchtesgaden .Everything went well, but not as good and not as fast as Maria wished, for theyexplained to Maria, that her technical data must be studied very thoroughly andthis could take a few months.They asked Dr. Schumann to submit a detailed scientific report on the materialpresented by Maria. It took Dr. Schumann two months to create a concise scientific dossier, andalmost 5 months to get the financing, even though members of Thule and DHvSSwere wealthy and affluent, and two additional meetings to put everything inorder.The delay seemed to slow down the enthusiasm of Maria, but Dr. Schumannreassured her that everything will be fine. *** *** *** The Fourth and Fifth Meeting s:We don’t have the precise dates, but we know that they occurred between Januaryand mid February of 1920.Worth mentioning here that Maria was overwhelmed by the presence of someattendees ( listed below ) because of their political affiliations and by a fewintellectuals known for their controversial ideologies , b ut she had no otheralternatives for the time being.Of course, in the following months she would distant herself from some of them,especially when she learned about their true agenda, and the reasons for theirinterest in building her flying machine.The only person she could fully trust was Dr. Schumann who has become a fatherfigure for Maria. *** *** *** Present at various meeting s :  Maria Orsic Traute A.

At one point, he said thatMaria Orsic’s cryptic text consisted of a very Old Babylonian language and ascript similar to Ugaritic cuneiform style of writing, but could not decipherthe Ana’kh text which contained the Aldebaran’s technical data on how to build asuper flying machine. He was puzzled by Ana’kh. ____________________________ [Image00009.jpg] Alfred Rosenberg [Image00010.jpg]Arnold Schoenberg[Image00011.jpg] [Image00012.jpg] Dr. Ernst Rudin  Dr.Otmar Freiherr von Verscheur Winfried Otto Schumann [Image00013.jpg] [Image00014.jpg] Dr. Winfried Otto Schumann Gottfried Feder [Image00015.jpg] Photograph of Julius Streicher [Image00016.jpg]http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/images/streicher/streicher45.jpgJulius Streicher  Wolfram Sievers [Image00017.jpg] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Theodor_Fritsch_1.jpg Theodor Fritsch[Image00018.gif] Rudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner [Image00019.jpg] Leopold Ziegler ____________________________ Preliminary notes and comments by Dr. Schumann Nota Bene: The following notes were given to Tomislav Orsic, Maria’s father, whofor a short time, worked at the Technical University of Munchen.Said notes and/or comments were reported by SS General Hans Kammler to the OSS ,and later confirmed by General Dr. Walter Dornberger. ________________________________ Excerpts from Dr. Winfried Otto Schumann’s notes: “ …I am not sure if Jenseitsflugmaschine could be built. In theory it ispossible. I am familiar with the concept of implosion, which has alread y beendiscussed by Mr. Schauberger…Dr. Schapeller’s experiments were successful , and in essence the technical dataas outlined by Maria do not contradict the findings of both Mr. Schauberger andDr. Schapeller.

This was documented by scientists who were recruited under theumbrella of Operation Paperclip and military scientists who worked for NASA. In1958 and later in 1963, the United States Air force experimented with the “Water Vortex ”, - a top secret project - , the use of water as a source ofelectro-magnetic energy and propulsion power for the mysterious underwaterunidentified submerged objects ( USO s).

In her mind, that flying machine could enter and exit adifferent dimension, part physical and part abstract, simply by positioning theflying machine on a stargates line she called the 33.33 degree line of Earth. Dr. Winfried Otto Schumann advised her to avoid implicating aliens in thisscenario, and particularly the use of scientific words, since she was not ascientist.The truth is , Maria never used scientific terminology, for herself admittedthat she was not familiar with the technical data she has received from theextraterrestrials of Aldebaran. Comparing Maria’s data with Viktor Schauberger and Karl Haushofer data Professor Schumann began to change his opinion about Maria’s scientificignorance, when he finally realized that a wonder-flying machine could be builtaccording to the data she gave him; and this made his efforts much easier inconvincing his distinguished academic colleagues to take part in the project ofbuilding the Jenseitsflugmaschine. He went two steps further and comparedMaria’s data with Viktor Schauberger and Karl Haushofer data, and to hisastonishment, he found out that: a- Maria’ data was scientifically valid , b-The data of Haushofer and Schauberger were not as developed andprogressive as her data.

But nobody was hundred per centsure if this thing could really fly, for first, its design was so strange,bizarre and unconventional, and second, making a machine fly without acombustion engine seemed irrational.

The records show that no UFO was ever built in Germany or in any part of theworld before 1922.Here we have two possi bilities:1-Either this photo is fake and ufology’s zealots are not aware of this fact,2-Or these enigmatic machines were indeed piloted by non-terrestrial entities.Back then, “Grays (Greys) were not in the picture; they appeared on thelandscape of American ufology some 50 or 60 years later.So who flew these machines? According to Traute, the beings of Light did. Maria Orsic had no comments on thesubject, simply because she never heard of aliens before she began to receive–periodically- messages from another world. As a matter of fact, Maria did notknow what or how to call these non-terrestrial beings in the early stage of hercommunications with the Aldebaran’s people. The words “Aliens” or“Extraterrestrials” were never used by Maria Orsic, until she received detailedinstructions and mystical messages in her third contact with them.And to set the record straight, Dr. Schumman was the first to have used the word“Extra-Terrestrials”, and not Maria Orsic! _________________________March 23 , 1922 : The f irst flight-test of Jenseitsflugmaschine ____________________________ A fiasco !It was a total failure as many have expected. A gigantic fiasco!Eye witnesses’ reports indicated that the machine blew up after spinning andspinning like fireworks, and the upper layer (Top of the machine) disintegrated,and the lower part (The third level) defragmented like a hand-grenade. Thosewere the actual words (“disintegrated ” , “ defragmented”) used by some of thebuilders of the Jenseitsflugmaschine . Dr. Schu man n was devastated, but Maria never gave hope.They went back to the drawing board, and began laboriously to reexamine theirdata. But all their efforts remain ed in vain. And by now everybody wasconvinced that it was a crazy idea! Until, three days later, when Maria Orsicrushed to Dr. Schu man n ’s o ffice with an apparent solution.S he provided him with “Guidance” she claimed she just received from theextraterrestrials.Dr. Schu man n sent her back home, and politely said, “Maria, it was a veryexciting project, but gravity is much stronger than any idea I came across.Please go home and forget the whole thing.” Maria Orsic did not argue with him,instead she handed him a few sketches and a series of formulae…and left with abig smile. Yes, it can be done!It took Dr. Schum an n only two hours to change his mind, “I thought it wasuseless until I saw something unusual in Maria’s drawings… (We don’t know whathe saw in the new sketches) and then I realized that yes, i t can be done…” saidSchu man n . -From Dr. Professor Winfried Otto Schumann ’s diary/notes.Upon hearing the news from Dr. Schumann , Maria was relieved, and for the sakeof argument she asked him why did he change his mind?We don’t know what he said.However we do know that Maria suggested to him to focus his attention on the“Space-time electromagnetic forces”; another concept totally unknown back then.Dr. Schu man n could have not solved the problem without Maria’s help! ______________________________ Mental command and channeling:My personal opinion is that Dr. Schu man n did not solve the problem in itsentirety without the help of Maria Orsic, for we know for sure that Maria Orsicbrought up the subjects of: a-Stargates, b-The 33.33 degree line, c-Space-time electromagnetic forces, d-The mental command of the spaceship. These four items, Professor Schu man n was not familiar with, and especially the“Mental Command” of the ship.By mental command, Maria meant channeling. And I can guess what the reaction ofDr. Schu man n was when he heard Maria Orsic talking about MENTAL COMMAND andCHANNELING!!In fact, the mental command was of a metaphysico-scientific nature based uponvery sophisticated aliens’ technology, and which consisted of a magnetic bandattached to the forehead of Maria which would allow her to command the craft atdistance. Headband Mental Command Device:Maria explained to Dr. Schu man n that the Jenseitsflugmaschine failed toperform as expected because it did not have her mental command. Dr. Schu man nwent ape, and threatened to quit.But once again, he changed his mind when Maria Orsic gave him instructions onhow to design and build the “Headband Mental Command Device”.It was one surprise after another, but he finally complied with Maria’s request.To many of us, this headb and thing seems far fetched, a sort of hallucinationin the mind of Maria, but it did materialize, and one set was built.In fact, a similar headband was retrieved from the debris of a crashed UFO nearRoswell in 1947 by the United States Air Force, and was sent to General ArthurTrudeau, then, head of the For eign Technology Desk at the United States Army'sResearch and Development Department .Gens. Spaatz and LeMay [Image00035.jpg] General Carl \"Tooey\" Spaatz, left, then,the Air Force chief of staff, and Lt. General Curtis LeMay, USAFE commander,review an honor guard upon Spaatz's arrival at the Wiesbaden Airport, Germany onMay 11 , 1948 . Worth mentioning here that General LeMay was a key player in theAmerican UFO saga cover-up . _________________________________ General Arthur Trudeau was fascinated by the aliens’ gadget and right away, hesolicited the help of two scientists to unlock its mystery, and thus, thereverse engineering of alien technology program began.Later on General Carl “ Tooey” Spaatz became heavily involved with the program.This is an absolute fact, no question about it!!!The “Aliens Transcripts of 1947 and 1948” show beyond the shadow of a doubt thatthe UFO which crashed near Roswell was mentally commanded from and by a metallic(Unknown alloy) band attached to the skull of the aliens, and their suits whichwere “glued” to their skin, as part of their bodies were also “animated” by theheadband.The spacecraft of the aliens had no apparent navigation devices and/ordashboards.The aliens’ headband became a major part of the military’s alien reverseengineering research/program. The very same headband, Maria Orsic talked about! [Image00036.jpg] General Trudeau, the father of the reverse engineering of alien technologyprogram . __________________________________ A new spaceship is built.December 17 of 1923: A new model of the super Je nseitsflugmaschine came to life _____________________________ Rebuilding a new spacecraft from scratch was not an easy task.New material was needed, and it was hard to find. Besides, it was timeconsuming, and some of the major investors/financiers of the project lostinterest, and insufficien t funds became a major obstacle, at least in the firststage of rebuilding a new spaceship.Maria and Ladies of Vril were penniless; money did not mean a thing to them.Maria Orsic earned very little by teaching ballet to beginners and foreignlanguages to wealthy children.Her mediumship-channeling séances and services to others were free of charge.And being the oldest in the Society and the leader of her movement, Maria wasresponsible for the daily expenses of the Vril-Gesellschaft , as well as thewelfare of its members.It was hard time for everybody, except for the wealthy m embers of Thule andDHvSS who have invested very heavily in the first ill -fated project. Luckily ,they did not mind to ref inance the new project from A to Z.And thus, by December 17 of 1923, a new model of the super Jenseitsflugmaschineca me to life. And the big day arrived ; the day of the second flight-test ofthe spaceship.Is it going to fly?Maria was absolutely confident, but not everybody in the group shared herenthusiasm. Nota Bene:Before, during and after the Jenseitsflugmaschine’s successful test-flight,Maria and Sigrun made eight consecutive visits to the hangar where the machinewas built, and gave their input and channeling findings to the engineers,especially during the initial stage of construction and the channeledflight-test.Overseeing the construction of the Jenseitsflugmaschine was not the only reasonbehind Maria and Sigrun frequent visits to the construction site; they needed tobecome familiar with the facility, in and out, for one day, Maria and the Ladiesof Vril will seize this super flying machine and fly to the stargate of the 33degree line, where she will rendezvous with the mother-ship of her friends fromAdelbaran.I tend to believe that Dr. Schumann was aware of that fact, but did not say aword to his colleagues.Why?I don’t know. It is a mystery to me!Dr. Schumann was a delightful human being, and had lots of respect andadmiration for Maria.He knew she was an extraordinary woman with high ethical standards, and one of akind. Maria’s farewell to Dr. Schumann showed how much they cared for eachother. *** *** *** A reconnaissance aerial photo of the Arado plant in 1944 [Image00037.jpg] .January, 1924: The first successful flight of JenseitsflugmaschineNote: Read full report on the Jenseitsflugmaschine in my book “GERMAN UFOs:Models & Categories, Engineers & Scientists, Extraterrestrial Messages,Supernatural, Ladies of the Vril, U.S. Link_______________________ user posted image [Image00038.jpg] Photo: Sigrun. It was a very successfu l and a spectacular test-flight. The spacecraft flew ata speed of 300,000 km/hour .B ut the Jenseitsflugmaschine landed after fifty five minutes as an archaicmachine, looking like a young girl who suddenly has aged 100 years.Maria explained this anomaly by referring to what she called “Parallel Zones”.According to Maria, when an object enters a different dimension, its propertiesare instantly modified, and in some instances totally altered.And this applies to humans too.The damaged Jenseitsflugmaschine terrified all the engineers, but understan dably not Dr. Schumann, because by now, he coul d tap into the inexplicable metaphysical world of Maria Orsic, and understand the occultic-metaphysical aspectof the project. Maria: “I am not interested in bombing people and cities.” Worth mentioning that Maria’s technical data was us ed to build other types ofUFOs; the most noted one was Vril 7 Geist which was built at Arado-Brandenburg,and flew in 1944. Maria guided the Geist mentally via her channeling abilities;it did not need the headband, Dr. Schumann built for her.In March of 1944, the engineers who previously worked on the successfulJenseitsflugmaschine asked Sigrun if they could use the Vril Triebwerk in therecently built strategic bomber “ E.555 ”, and Sigrun refused categorically.Maria reacted strongly and said, “I am not interested in bombing people andcities.”Secretly manufact uring two small flying machines ___________________ Maria Orsic asked Professor Schumann to tell the members of the Thule and DHvSSthat the project needed more work and the flying machine was not perfect yet.Maria had justifiable reasons; she feared that if the fanatic members from DHvSSand supporters of Hitler discover that the space craft in its actual conditioncould be successfully and immediately deployed, they would not hesitate a secondto use it as a destructive war weapon.Thus , based upon Schumann’s recommendations, Maria Orsic ’s Vril was sent to ahangar in Munich , for further improvements, and consequently, all flightsceased temporarily.At the same time, Maria and Sigrun were thinking about secretly manufacturingtwo small flying machines with all the flying properties of the big one, in case, something should happen to it, be confiscated by the authorities, or evenstolen. Maria Orsic’s new two circular crafts: a- OSS records , b-CIA Helms’ files, c-Statement by Dr. Eugene Sänger, d-Statement by Major Erich Hartmann, e- Statement by Lt. Colonel Walter Horten , f- A nd of course Professor Shumann’s own testimony,Show that de facto, Maria Orsic’s two circular crafts, 27 feet in diameter we reproduced with the help of four retired engineers .RFC-2 was one of the two small space craft s, designed by Maria, and developedby Dr. Winfried Otto Schumann and four recently recruited engineers. It waselegant, with a shiny metallic surface, made from an unknown alloy; it was thiskind of alloy the Russians were extremely interested in, because we know thatStalin’s NKVD discussed with Dr. Eugene Sänger how it could be obtained.RFC-2 was spotted and reported on Sunday 18, March 1945, by Lt. Col. WalterFellenz, serial number 0-23055 from the United States Army, 42nd InfantryDivision, 1st Battalion. The sighting was confirmed by Brigadier General HenningLinden . To this day, nobody knows the properties of the unprecedented alloy of RFC-2except -as it was leaked out by NASA insiders in 2007-, by a bunch of engineersand metallurgists working for NASA, and especially on the Shuttle’s programs. [Image00039.jpg] Dr. Eugene Sänger_____________________ The alloy research program began y ears ago under the guidance of three Germanscientists who were recruited by Dr. von Braun for Operation Paperclip, rightafter the Second World War. The records show that Dr. Schumann recruited four engineers to develop and buildMaria’s discs: 1 -The first was an engineer/architect who previously worked forMesserschmitt’s Kokothanki, on the BF 109 G6-14, 2 -T he second was from Focke-Wulf, 3 -T he third was from Heinkel, 4 -T he fourth , from the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, also known asBavarian Aircraft Company. All were carefully and intelligently recruited by Dr. Schumann, because the fourscientists had access to material, he desperately needed. Story confirmed by Major Hartmann:This story was also confirmed by Major Erich Hartmann when he returned toGermany in October 1955, after spending a 10 year sentence in Russia .The statements of Major Hartmann appeared in the secret files of Richard Helms(a former CIA director in 1970). Helms kept a voluminous file on Maria Orsic.In 1945, while serving as the United States intelligence chief in Berlin , Helmsobtained vital information on Maria and her Vril spacecraft, yet he kepteverything buried in his secret vaults for years. Major Erich Hartmann died on September 19, 1993 at Weil im Schönbuch. He wasconsidered Germany ’s greatest fighter ace.General Dwight Eisenhower admitted that Major Hartmann was the greatest fighterpilot of all time s .Hartmann flew 825 missions and scored 352 victories. Nota bene:Professor Schumman did not totally abandon the project.Records show that he continued with the development of new types and classes ofUFOs. *** *** *** Erich Hartmann [Image00040.jpg] Major Erich Hartmann .He confirmed that Maria Orsic’s two small circular crafts, 27 feet in diameterwere built by Dr. Schumann. __________________[Image00041.jpg]Sketch of the Vril 1-Triebwerk, built upon specifications and technical dataprovided by Maria Orsic. ____________________________________________[Image00042.jpg] Sketch of the Vril 7 , built according to Maria’s technicaldata.Identical data will be used on e day, by the Russians to build their own UFO,which flew twice over Siberia and Leningrad , and inexplicably vanished from theface of the earth.[Image00043.jpg]A Russian UFO. __________________________________________ Ea rly Allies intelligence reports.Early Allies intelligence reports tell us that: 1 -The first German UFOs project was led by W.

The Hortens believed her and historical records show that they fled Germany toArgentina in 1945. The Hortens advised Maria not to talk about it in thepresence of SS officers, for they will think she is a traitor and will shoot heron the spot.However they did advise her to warn a few civilian scientists who have workedwith them on the Horten 229. And Maria did. Gudrun Burwitz, Himmler ’s daughter never forgave Maria Orsic upon learning whatshe knew and what she did. On that event, the daughter of Goering remained quiet, however she did confess to a confident that her father Herman Goering alreadyknew about the inevitable defeat of Germany, but he was not very much alarmed,because he sincerely believed that he could negotiate some kind of a deal withthe Americans.He was mistaken. Maria’s message to Magda Goebbles:Inge Schulz , one of Maria’s associates who had a direct access to powerfulfigures in the military hierarchy, managed to reach Magda Goebbles, the wife ofJosef Goebbles and delivered what she later called “Message of Escape”.She told Magda Goebbles about the vision of Maria, and Maria’s sincere concernfor the lives of her daughters.Unfortunately, Mrs. Go e bbles did not believe her, and the rest is history.Magda and Josef Goebbles before co mmitting suicide asked Dr. Helmut Kunz topoison their six children.

Traudl Junge [Image00080.jpg] Traudl Junge in 2002.In 2002, Mrs. Junge told me : “We did receive a message from Maria Orsic, and itwas delivered to Mrs. Goebbles by Inge Schulz … Bormann read it first…”Both Flegal and Junge stated that an urgent message from Maria Orsic wasdelivered to Mrs. Goebbles, but unfortunately nobody took it seriously.Rochus Misch, who worked as a telephone operator in Hitler’s bunker alsoreported that a message from Orsic was sent to Mrs. Goebbles .Magda told Erna Flegal about Maria’s message, and added that M aria had a way ofgetting her out of Berlin with her daughters, by some sort of a new type ofairplane she had at her disposal. [Image00081.jpg] Magda Goebbles____________________________ Erna Flegal immediately replied, “Please madam, leave right now…take thechildren and go…” Magda replied: “I belong to my husband. And the childrenbelong to me. I can’t leave Joseph…”Erna Flegal said, “She broke my heart, because I was very fond of her, she wasan extraordinary woman, a brilliant woman, on a far higher level than mostpeople, and I loved her children… they were charming. They would have delightedanybody.

They had nothing to dowith what was going on around them. Not to spare the children was madness,dreadful…I didn’t like her husband because he cheated on her all the time. Infact, nobody liked Goebbels.”Flegal continued, “The next day Hitler shot himself, there were a few people who heard the shot. Others didn’t… the remaining staff then had to decide whetherto stay or not to stay. [Image00084.jpg]Erna Flegel with Adolf Hitler. [Image00085.jpg]Richard Helms (a former CIA director in 1970).Helms kept a voluminous file on Maria Orsic. In 1945, while serving as theUnited States intelligence chief in Berlin , Helms obtained vital information onMaria and her Vril spacecraft, yet he kept everything buried in his secretvaults.____________________________ I knew that Hitler was dead because there were suddenly more doctors in thebunker. I didn't see his body. But it was taken up to the chancellery garden andburned. And then I began to hear about Orsic’s mysterious airplane… two SSofficers were talking about it, but I did not hear everything. Martin Bormann(Hitler’s private secretary) knew what they were talking about, and I remembervery well what he said to them, something like “It (Maria’s airplane, moreprecisely as I think, one of Maria’s early prototypes) is not very far fromhere…we can fly to Austria, but I was not interested in what Bormann was talkingabout, because I kept thinking about the children and Dr. Helmut Kunz, whoinjected the children with poison …”Erna Flegal’s testimony remained classified and secured in Richard Helms (aformer CIA director) vaults, and who in 1945, was the United State sintelligence chief in Berlin . [Image00086.jpg] Soldiers of the Red Army displaying the dead bodies of thedaughters of Josef Goebbels, poisoned by Dr. Helmut Kunz .

Getting out of Berlin was theonly way to save her life and the lives of her daughters.But Mrs. Magda Goebbels either did not believe Maria Orsic, or her loyalty toAdolph Hitler and the duty of standing by her hu sband till the death preventedher from leaving Berlin . _______________________________[Image00088.jpg]Edda4.jpg [Image00089.jpg] Adolf Hitler with his god-daughter Edda Goering,daughter of Goering, held by her mother Emmy.

Quiteoften, he spoke publicly against Hitler and the SS. Three days after he passedaway in 1952, a Catholic nun found a letter in his papers left in his desk ’sdrawers , written by Maria Orsic , and dated Tuesday 7, March 1944 . Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich from 1917 to 1952, in aphoto of 1949 [Image00092.jpg] Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich during NAZI Germany.____________________________________ Maria’s letter is of an extreme importantce, for four reasons :1- She predicted that Joseph Ratzinger will become Pope. Worth mentioning herethat Joseph Ratzinger was ordained priest by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber o nJune 29, 1951, six years after Maria had left Munich.In her letter, Maria Orsic asked the Archbishop to remind Father Ratzinger toreveal the truth about Mary Magdalene , once he is t he Holy Father in theVatican.In fact, Father Joseph Ra tzinger was elected Pope on April 19, 2005, and chosethe pontifical name Benedict. Thus he became Pope Benedict XVI. [Image00093.jpg] Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber l aying hands on the head of Joseph Ratzinger,the future Pope Benedict XVI, on June 29, 1951.________________________________ 2 - Maria ’s letter contained the drawi ngs of a rosette surrounded by twoscorpions . This is quite extraordinary because a rosette surrounded by twoscorpions represented the symbol of Inanna, the Anunnaki goddess who accordingto the Sumerian epics, took part in the cre ation of the first human beings inMesopotamia .[Image00094.jpg]Sumerian Scorpions and Rosette, circa 3300 B.C.

[Image00095.gif] Inanna, Anunnaki goddess in the Babylonian myths.Identified as Astarte, Ashtaroot and Ishtar in the Uragitic and Phoenicianliterature. ___________________________3 - Maria’s letter contained a small drawing of a star surrounded by a crescent(Half-moon); this is also extraordinary, because a star surrounded by a crescentwas one of the symbols of the extraterrestrial Anunnaki .It appeared on numerous Mesopotamian slabs and clay tablets . [Image00096.jpg]The stele of Ur-Nammu, circa 2200 B.C. On the very top, the star surrounded by acrescent, Maria drew in her letter to Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber .4 - On the left corner of the letter, Maria wrote down t he number 33.33 , whichrepresents the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials point of rendezvous with Maria. What was she trying to tell the Archbishop of Munich?What kind of relation did exist between Maria Orsic, a non-Catholic and a mysticrebel and the Archbishop?These two questions remained unanswered to the present day. However, we do knowthat Maria met with Cardinal Michael vo n Faulhaber in Munich on threeoccasions: Wednesday 13, January 1943 Tuesday 4, May 1943 Thursday 24, February 1944 What Maria Orsic told Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber about theextraterrestrials, God and religions. image 1 [Image00097.jpg] Photo: Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber. Cardinal von Faulhaber and Maria discussed several subjects, including but notlimited to the medical experiments of Dr. Rascher, the detention of 2,345Catholic priests at Dachau , outside Munich , and Maria’s extraterrestrialmessages about religions , the nature of God and the origin of Man.The Car dinal’s fascination with Maria Orsic’s psychic and channeling abilities,prompted him to ask her if she would set up a séance to communicate with thespirit of Franziska Streitel, the Franciscan nun who died in 1911 .Politely, Maria Orsic told the Cardinal that she communicates only withextraterrestrials; however she will be glad to discuss with him what theAdelbaran’s beings of light told her about God, religion, the extraterrestrialcivilizations on Earth, and the salvation of the human race.The Cardinal was so eager and anxious to hear what Maria could possibly tell himabout God, Jesus Christ, earth’s religions and particularly Christianity. AndMaria obliged.[Image00098.jpg] Rabbi Israel Zolli, the Chief Rabbi of Rome . He was baptized in the Basilica of St. Mary of the Angels by Msgr. Luigi Tralia.Rabbi Zolli was considered one of the world’s leading authorities on the Bible,Torah, Talmud and Jewish Scriptures. He served as the Chief Rabbi of Trieste for35 years. Many, including Reverend Arthur B. Klyber , a Hebrew Catholic priest(An Orthodox Jew who also converted to Christianity) b elieve that Rabbi Zollitook part in the translation of the Sumero-Akkadian-Ana’kh texts, Maria Orsicreceived in her extraterrestrial messages. ______________________________ [Image00099.jpg] Reverend Arthur B.

Rabi Zolli stated that Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber dis cussed with him partof his chats with Maria Orsic.And here is a synopsis of Maria and the Cardinal discussion that occurred onWednesday 13, January 1943 in Munich. Note: By no means, the synopsis of the meeting on Wednesday 13 is 100% accurate,for it is a recreation by Rabbi Eugenio Zolli, however the Rabbi did state thatthe “Essence and truth are there…”Cardinal:… So, who are these Ausserirdischen ( E xtraterrestrials)?Maria: They are beings of light and of a great knowledge from Adelbaran. Cardinal: What is Adelbaran?Maria: Where they live. Cardinal: How do you know that?Maria: They told me. Cardinal: Do they speak German?Maria: No. Cardinal: So how did you talk to them?In what language?Maria: Mentally…they send me visions and messages I catch in my mind . I havealso received instructions in ancient languages. Cardinal: What ancient languages?Maria: A form of an old Sumerian language mixed with Ana’kh. Cardinal: Ana’kh?What is that?Maria: Their language.They speak Ana’kh.It is the language of the Anunnaki. Cardinal: Anunnaki? Meaning what?Maria: The Anunnaki are the extraterrestrials being of light who created usthousands of years ago. Cardinal: What are you talking about my dear child. This is a blasphemy.Don’t you know God created us?Didn’t you read your Bible?Maria: I did…I read the Bible many times, but the truth is not in the Bible. Cardinal: What truth are you talking about?Maria: The truth about who is God, who created us, and life on other planets. Cardinal: The aliens told you that they created us?Maria: Yes your eminence. They did. Cardinal: What did they tell you about God?Maria: God exists only here…on Earth. There is no God beyond earth and on otherplanets. We created God. Cardinal: Did they tell you anything about our Lord Jesus Christ?Maria: Nothing. Cardinal: Did they tell you anything about the devil and his temptations?Maria: No. Nothing. Cardinal: So, if they don’t believe in God, they would not believe in our LordJesus Christ either.Correct?Maria: Correct. Cardinal: What do they believe in?Do they have a religion they follow?Maria: No. They don’t have any religion.They don’t need any…they know…they know the greatest secrets of the universe,and they know there is no God…T hey told me there is a cosmic logic, a cosmic law, some sort of benevolent andpositive energy that created the universe and we are part of it…and the mostimportant thing is to follow the light and be fair and just. Cardinal: I see ….Are they humans or angels? Or something else?Maria: We were created in their image. Cardinal: Who created us in their image?Maria: They did. Cardinal: Why did they contact you?Maria: They wanted me to create a spaceship. Cardinal: A spaceship?What for? Why didn’t they contact the Luftwaffe?Maria: Because the Luftwaffe is evil. Cardinal: I see. They are right about that…about the spaceship, tell me, whatare you going to do with the spaceship?Do you know how to build a spaceship?Maria: It is built already. Cardinal: Who built it?Maria: People I trust. Note: More on this subject in a book I am working on: “Maria Orsic, the MostImportant Person in Ufology’s History.” *** *** ***[Image00100.jpg][Image00101.jpg][Image00102.jpg] Nazi Germany collapses…Final Days of Maria Orsic in Germany_________________________ Farewell to her friend, Dr. Schumann [Image00103.gif]Photo: Dr. Schumann. On Thursd a y 15, March 1945, Maria Orsic met with Dr. Schumann for the lasttime at Sterneckerstraße , Munich .Dr. Schumann gave Maria two unidentified larges files, assumed to be thedossiers on the last version of German UFOs and her preliminary sketches.Dr. Schumann remained grateful to Maria, for the rest of his life, even thoughshe left with Jenseitsflugmaschine; a machine he worked on for years, and wantedto keep close to his sight, mind and soul.He had no regrets, for from Maria’s visions , he was able to develop greatscientific discoveries and inventions such as: a-His legendary “ Levitator, known to us as “Schumann SM-Levitator”,also known as VRIL DRWE. b-The Triebwerk; an anti-gravity thrust engine . Before she left Dr. Schu man n , Maria hugged him very strongly, and tears inher eyes she said to him, Germany will be totally destroyed by the end of 1945,but will remerge as a great industrial nation in less than 60 years. She added,the Third Reich was a major mistake and a catastrophe to Germany . She regrettedthat Raumschiff was not built much earlier, for she could have used it to stopthe war, alter the fate of Germany and bring peace on earth.Dr. Schumann asked her: “And now where to Maria?”And Maria with a sad smile replied, “To the station (33 .33 degree line aroundEarth) where they are waiting for me.”Dr. S c humann: And you will be flying the Jenseitsflugmaschine…No, I am not going to ask you where did you learn how to fly such a monster?Maria: I will be guided…did you forget the band you created for me?Dr. Schu man n : How far will it take you?Maria: To the station, and from there, their mother ship will take me to them…Ihave already explained everything to Traute, Heike , and the others, and theyare happy.Dr. Schu man n : Will I see you again?Maria: Not in this world …I will always remember you… [Image00104.gif] SterneckerstraßeThey hugged each other. Maria kissed his forehead and said, “So long my friend,I leave with you a big part of my heart…”On Saturday 17, March 1945 , Maria and her Vril group went to the hangars ofMesserschmidt , Augsburg , to take possession of the Vril spaceship. Spotted by Lt. Col. Walter Fellenz:On Sunday 18, March 1945, Maria Orsic and the Ladies of Vril left Munich to ades tination only known to Dr. Schu man n and Lt. Colonel Walter Horten.On this day, the United States Eighth Air Force mounted the heaviest raid ofWorld War II against Berlin .Lt. Col. Walter Fellenz, serial number 0- 23055 from the United States Army,42nd Infantry Division, 1st Battalion, (Part of the 7 th Army) that enteredMunich in March, 1945 reported seeing a strange looking craft hovering overMunich and disappearing at an incredible speed. [Image00105.jpg] Lt. Col. Walter Fellenz , a reliable eye witness who reported the sighting ofMaria Orsic’s UFO-Vril hovering over Munich on Sunday 18, March 1945. Later on, Lt. Col. Walter Fellenz would describe the craft as a huge circularshape flying craft without wings. There is no doubt in my mind, that circularshape flying craft was Maria Orsic’s UFO-Vril.The statement of Fellenz was confirmed by Brigadier General Henning Linden, andthe Fellez-circular UFO story was told by Colonel Buldoc.

This 33 .33 degreeline was mentioned by Maria Orsic.Ash.Ta.Ri constellation has millions upon millions of stars and planets, andmany of them are a physical stargate, the Anunnaki Ulema call “an opening on ”multiple universes and dimensions, including the astronomical bodies of thephysical galaxies, and celestial ones that escape time and space, even beforetime was created, and since time existed as another dim ension outside thelandscape of the physical universe; this is incomprehensible to the human mind.  So, why are we talking here about Ash.Ta.Ri? What relation there is between Ash.Ta.Ri and Aldebaran? What is Maria Orsic’s relation to the extraterrestrial Anunnaki? Did the Anunnaki talk to Maria? And how does Maria Orsic fit in this scenario? Well, Alpha Tauri was known to the Arabs as Aldebaran.And Aldebaran is known to the Anunnaki Ulema as Ash.Ta.Ri.The verb “Adbara” in Arabic means: He left, he moved away, he traveled, hewalked away. And the correct meaning of the word Aldebaran is NOT “who hefollows, or the follower” as tragically interpreted by Encyclopedia Britannica!And I am puzzled and astonished by Britannica’s wrong definition of Aldebaran!!Al Debaran or AlDaber means, “he who moved away, who left, who traveled”, andthe Arabic verb is “Adbara”. Any person who speaks Arabic knows what “Adbara”means. The Arab nomads and early tribes in the Middle East , including thePersian Gulf and the Arab Peninsula have used the verb s “Idbir” and “Adbar” intheir spoken dialect, and written language. *** *** *** Aldebaran’s aliens are not the Anunnaki, but an offspring of the Anunnaki __________________ Aldebaran was mentioned in two important books: 1-The Anunnaki Ulema “Book of Ramadosh”, 2-The Arabic book “Ilmu Al Donia” (Science or Knowledge of theworld”.So, Aldebaran is Ash.Ta.Ri, the constellation of the Anunnaki, and the home ofthe extraterrestrials beings of lights Maria told us about. But keep in mind,that the Aldebaran’s aliens are not the Anunnaki, but an offspring of theAnunnaki, sharing the same galactic genes.And yes, both descended on Phoenicia , Mesopotamia and the Anatolian plateau ofAsia Minor ( Turkey and Armenia ) 450,000-460,000 B.C. The Aldebarans’extraterrestrials who were part of the Anunnaki’s expedition to Earth, took partin establish ing civilizations in the Near East, Middle East and Asia Minor .Some of their colonies were:EriduUrukNippur Nineveh Lagash Ur UmmaAssurEbla Saydoon ( Sidon , Saida)Tyrakh ( Tyre , Sour)Kadmosh[Image00114.jpg]Map of Sumer , showing the location of the Anunnaki cities: Babylon , Lagash ,Uruk, Ur and Eridu . ________________________________________ AdonakhIlayshimMarkadash ( Byblos to the Greeks, and Jbail to the Arabs)Baalbeck, where we find the legendary “Hajarat Al Houblah”Ugarit These cities and their civilizations are mentioned in the ancient scriptures ,slabs, and clay tablets of the Middle East , Near East, the Phoenician Cosmogony, the Sumero-Akkadian epics written in cuneiform , and the Bible. Maria Orsic was right when she said that the Aldebaran’s people createdcivilizations in Mesopotamia ( Sumeria , Babylon , Akkad , so on), a nd theycame from Aldebaran (Ash.Ta.Ri, Alpha Tauri).Some authors and well-known hosts of TV shows on aliens have claimed that Nibiruis the planet of the Anunnaki and the ancient alien gods, because the Sumeriantablets said so!If this is the case, then Mari a Orsic’s claims are wrong! No! Maria was r ight,and they are wrong because the Sumerian epics never mentioned Nibiru as thehome-planet of the Anunnaki; those people need -first- to learn Akkadian andSumerian before they interpret epics written in languages they can’t read. Nibiru “Ne.Be.Ru” in the Akkadian/Sumerian texts ____________________________ The Anunnaki (Anu.Na.Ki) and their offspring (2 categories/2 classes) came toEarth from Ash.Ta.Ri (Aldebaran) constellation as exactly Maria Orsic has said. Is there any passage, any line, any reference in the Enuma Elish “Epic ofCreation”, the “Epic of Gilgamesh”, and/or any Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets,mentioning Nibiru as the planet of the Anunnaki? None whatsoever!So, there is no evidence at all that Nibiru “Ne.Be.Ru” is de facto a planetinhabited by the Anunnaki, since there are no records to that effect in theancient Akkadian, Sumerian, Ba bylonian and Mesopotamian texts ?Correct!The Akkadian/Sumerian scribes used the word Nibiru, more correctly Ne.Be.Ru as aname for Jupiter, and later on, referred to Mercury as Nibiru.Even their god, the mighty Anunnaki Marduk was called Nibiru. *** *** ***Aldebaran and Ash.Ta.Ri in the ancient texts ________________________ Where do we find the se word s in the Akkadian/Sumerian Tablets and texts? 1. In the Epic of Enuma Elish, Tablet 7, Line s 124, 125Akkadian/Sumerian text (Transliteration):d Ne-be-ru ne-be-re-et same, u erseti lu t amehmaTranslation:Let him be the holder of the crossing of heavens and earth.Note: “ Let him ” means Nibiru and Marduk.And Mercury and Jupiter were associated with god Marduk.This is documented in the epic of “ Enuma Elish ” , in Tablet VII, lines:126,130,131.It is also translated by some Assyriologists as follows:Let Nibiru be the marker “Holder” ofHeaven and earth crossing place.Note:“S ame” (Pronounced Shameh) means heaven.Sama in Arabic. Shem in Phoenician, Shama in Ulemite.Shamayim in Hebrew; a plural form meaning heights.“ erseti ” means Earth. Other words: Ersetu, Erdsetu.Erd (Ard) in Arabic. Heretz (Eretz) in Hebrew. Erda in Ulemite. 2. Appeared i n lines 130 and 131.Akkadian/Sumerian text (Transliteration):d Ne-be-ru kakkabu- s usa ina s ame, u-su-pu-uTranslation:“ Ne.Be.Ru is his star , which he made appear in the heavens.” Also translatedas follows: “Nibiru is his star which inheavens made it appear.”Note: “ His star ” refers to Marduk. 3. Also i n the Epic of Enuma Elish, Tablet 5, Line 6.Here is the text:u-sar-sid man-zad-azd Ne.Be.Ru ana ud-du-u rik-si-su-unTranslation:He promptly set the position (Place) ofNibiru to fix their limits (Frontiers, boundaries).OrHe created the station ofNibiru to determine their bounds.Note:He , refers to Markuk.Their , refers to planets or stars.Interesting information in the following lines:8. He (Marduk) fixed the station of Bel and Ea along with him.9. He opened great gates (Ba’abs) on both sides.4 . In Tablet 7, Line 109.Let his name be Nibiru, the capturer of the midst.Note: His name , means Marduk.Also in Tablet 7, Line 126.Translation of the Akkadian/Sumerian text: “The stars of heaven, let him settheir course; let him shepherd all the gods like sheep.”Note: “ Let him ” refers to Ne.Be.Ru. *** *** *** In Anunnaki Ulema manuscripts ______________________  1. In the Book of Ramadosh, Scroll 21, Sifr “Chapter” 12:Here is the text (Transliteration) :Ne.Be.Ru ina Ashtari (Aldebaran) mina khalkah.Translation:Ne.Be.Ru from Ashtari (Constellation or Star) was created.  2. In the Book of Ramadosh, Scroll 21, Sifr “Chapter” 13, a lengthyarticle, which was also mentioned in Ambar Anati revelation:Note: See Chapter 3.  3. In the Kitabu Ilmu Al Donia “Book of the Knowledge Of the World”,Fasel Ashrah (Chapter 10):Here is the text (Transliteration) :Wa min Ashtari (Aldebaran) barazat Ne.Be.Ru, kawkab al Ana’kh, asyaad al kawnand khalikeen al bashar.Translation:And from Ashtari (Aldebaran to Maria and to the Arabs), emerged Ne.Be.Ru, thestar of the Anunnaki, masters of the universe and creators of the human race. *** *** *** Epistemology/Etymology:Ne .Be.R u is composed of three words: a - Ne (Pronounced Nii) means from within, similar to the words Ina,In, Na in proto-Sumerian, Akkadian and Assyrian. b - Be (Pronounced Behh) means light or source of implosion.A strong emphasis was placed upon “Implosion” to highlight its prime differencewith “Explosion”, since according to Ulema Bukhtiyar, the planet Ne.Be.R u wasnot created by an explosion of another star or a planet, or the collision ofother celestial (Space) bodies, as modern science has explained the birth of newstars and planets.Ne.Be.R u was created from an implosion. Quite a revolutionary concept! I foundthis astonishing, for Maria Orsic and her group of scientists who worked onMaria’s UFO-Vril said that Vril is the ultimate source of energy in theuniverse, and their super flying machine (UFO) will be propelled by an“Implosion Energy”, not a combustion engine. c - Ru (Pronounced Roo h) means lasting force or energy. Worthmentioning here, that the Arabic word روح “Rouh” (Soul, Spirit, Self ا لنفس )and the Hebrew word רוח “Ru’akh”, (Nephesh like the Arabic word Nephes) meanlife. Both Hebrew and Arabic words derived from the Ana’kh. *** *** *** Is it true that in the Akkadian/Sumerian texts, Nibiru was also referred to as adiv ine being, a star, and a deity?Correct. Because the word Nibiru always had the prefix “Mul”, and the prefix “ d”.These two prefixes were usually used in Akkadian and in Sumerian cuneiform textsto refer to a divine status of something or somebody.So when we see Nibiru written as d Nibiru or Mul Nibiru , we immediatelyunderstand that Nibiru is divine.This was a linguistic standard of Akkadian and Sumerian.The Anunnaki-Ulema have defined what Nibiru means in one of their manuscriptsdated 95 or 96 B.C.According to Ulema Ghandar, Ne .Be.R u means: The Lasting Energy, or the PrimeImplosion, Maria Orsic defined Aldebaran as the planet of the divine cosmicenergy, and their inhabitants as the beings of light. *** *** *** T he Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets are very confusing. In some passages, thetexts refer to Ne.Be.Ru as a star, in other passages, Ne.Be.Ru is not a planet,but a crossing point, serving as a stargate, a gateway, and somewhere else inthe cuneiform texts, Ne.Be.Ru is a deity, a dividing point or a zone, Jupiter,Mercury, Anu nnaki god Marduk, and/or Marduk, Jupiter and Mercury,three-in-one!!  In the Sumerian/Akkadian texts, we found this line :“Ne-bar-ti-Ash-shur.”Meaning: “ The Crossing Point of Asshur.”Note: Ass hur “Assur” was an ancient Mesopotamian- Babylonian -Assyrian city. In another passage , we found this line :“ina Abani ni-bi-ru u-cha-du-u.”Meaning: To “have cut off the crossing way of the river Abani.”Note: This passage refers to the Elamites. Reference: The Epic of Gilgamesh.Text from the Epic : “ Straight is the crossing point, and narrow is the waythat leads to it.”  The Akkadian and Sumerian word Ne.Bi.Rim means crossing.Akkadian/Sumerian text (Transliteration):shiqil kaspum sha ne.bi.rim.Translation: Silver paid for the crossing.Meaning: A fee was paid for a person who transports people, across the waters.Ne.bi.rim as a word , means crossing.Nebiri as a verb , means to cross something or cross over. *** *** *** In other ancient languages ______________________  In pro to-Old Babylonian, the verb Abri and Ne.Bri mean to traverse,to cross.  In Arabic, the verb Abara, and Abra mean to cross, to traverse. Theword Abirun ( Abiroun ) means those who traverse, who cross over.  The Early Hebrews (Israelites) were called Habiru or Abiru , whichmeans those who have crossed.  In Ulemite, Ibru and Abru mean to traverse. And Nibru is an openingarea in space which allows a traveler or a machine to enter another dimension. *** *** *** In 1902, L .W. King provided us with the following translation o f Tablets 5 and7 of the Enuma Elish “Epic of the Creation”: In the Fifth Tablet we read: He (Marduk) made the stations for the great gods;The stars, their images, as the stars of the Zodiac, he fixed.He ordained the year and into sections he divided it;For the twelve months he fixed three stars.After he had ... the days of the year ... images,He founded the station of Nibiru (the planet Jupiter) to determine their bounds;That none might err or go astray,He set the station of Bel and Ea along with him.He opened great gates on both sides,He made strong the bolt on the left and on the right.In the midst thereof he fixed the zenith;The Moon-god he caused to shine forth, the night he entrusted to him.He appointed him, a being of the night, to determine the days;In the Seventh Tablet, we read: He (Marduk) named the four quarters of the world, mankind he created,The Creator of the earth.…May he hold the Beginning and the Future, may they pay homage unto him,Saying, \"He who forced his way through the midst of Tiamat without resting,Let his name (Marduk) be Nibiru, “the Seizer of the Midst!”For the stars of heaven he upheld the paths,He shepherded all the gods like sheep!He conquered Tiamat, he troubled and ended her life,\"In the future of mankind, when the days grow old,May this be heard without ceasing; may it hold sway forever!Since he created the realm of heaven and fashioned the firm earth. Mul.Apin:Here is the text (Transliteration) :Kima kakka-bu sut d Enlil ugdammiruni isten kakkabuRabu sessu da mat same ustamsalma izzaz kakkabD Amar.Ud Ne.Be.Ru sag. me. gar mamzassuIttanakkir same ibbirTranslation:When the stars of Enlil were completed (Finished)One star with big dim light, he (Enlil) divides the heaven (Sky) in half andstands thereThat is the star (of Marduk) Ne.Be.Ru Jupiter which keepsChanging its position and traverses the Heaven (Sky). Important Note:The last two lines : sag.me. gar mamzassu Ittanakkir same ibbir . The text s eems to tell us that Nibiru did cross the sky! Is it a contradiction, or simply,the two lines meant that Nibiru was rotating around another star? TheAkkadian/Sumerian texts do not provide any explanation. *** *** *** Summary of findings: The Anunnaki and the Anunnaki Ulema identified Aldebran (As h .Ta.Ri) as theirconstellation, and Ne.Be.Ru as a crossing point to other dimensions. Linguistically speaking (Epistemologically and etymologically), t he Arabic words of “ Aldebaran ” , “ Abirun ”, the Arabic verbs , “ Abara ” , “ Abra ” , th eSumerian -Akkadian word “ Ne.bi.rim ” , and the Ana’kh/Ulemite words “ AshtariAldebaran barazat Ne.Be.Ru ” refer in essence to the very same thing: Aldebaran(The Constellation of Ashtari) home of Maria Orsic Alderbaran ’sextraterrestrials and Anunnaki. *** *** *** How did Maria Orsic describe Aldebaran (Ash.Ta.Ri)? ______________________________ Maria’s description of Aldebaran is identical to the description of Ash.Ta.Ri,given by Anunnaki Sinhar Ambar Anati to American scientists and United Statesgovernment officials and which we have on record.It is also similar to the description of other inhabitable planets in theAldebaran constellation and other constellations given by the female alien Riyahto American generals, linguists and scientists in 1947.The three extraterrestrials’ descriptions can be compared in the “1947-1948Aliens Transcripts”, “Mouzakarat Sinhar Marduk”, “Book of Ramadosh”, and “KitabuIlmu Al Donia” . 1. Days c alendar and moons around the inhabitable planets in Aldebaran :A day consists of forty-eight hours.The sun rises around four o’clock in the morning, and the sunrise takes abouttwo hours and twenty five minutes ; the colors in the sky at that time arespectacular.The sun shines for eighteen hours in the summer and for twelve hours in thewinter; there are only two seasons on their planets.The sun then takes two hours for sunsets .Ash.Ta.Ri (The planet of the Anunnaki) has four moons.All moons rise harmoniously one after the other, and line up in four differentdirections. The home-planet of the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials has two moonsand two planets rotating around it. The moons of each planet stay for about tenhours. And w hen they fade away , they follow the same pattern, one after theother in the same synchronized manner. *** *** *** 2. Atmosphere and energy: a -No pollution; b -No smokes from factories; c -No oil fuels; d -Pure electromagnetic energy is used exclusively. The term“electromagnetic” is not totally correct. But this is as close as we get tounderstand its properties.Their energy consists of a blend of spatial neuro-plasma and subatomicmolecules. And even these wordings are not correct because on planet earth,blending or fusing these elements and substances together contradict mainstreamscience. *** *** *** 3. W aters, lands and lakes :There are plenty of canals, and so much water on their planet; about fifty/fiftyto the land, the ratio is, but they have some wonderful lakes underground whichare as blue as a sapphire. *** *** *** 4. A djacent planets and other extraterrestrials :Inhabitants of adjacent planets vary sharply from one civilization to another,but all are highly advanced, and have one thing in common, which is verycharacteristic of their climate: An anti-pollution shield that protects theiratmosphere. On Earth, it is the Ozone.In the Aldebaran’s solar system, there are two small planets that support life,and are inhabited by people who resemble us. They have evolve d very slowly, andare considered by other galactic civilizations to be inferior, “ even savages ”,because they eat meat and fight. At the far edge of their solar system there are four planets which are totallydifferent from their habitat, because none has an atmosphere. They are cold, andsterile.And their inhabitan ts don’t look like us physically; in fact their appearancewill scare the hell out of us, because some look like machines, while otherslike huge insects and reptilians.Other civilizati ons are aware of their existence, but they avoid them becausethey are hostile and very aggressive; they belong to the forces of darkness.Maria like Sinhar Anati talked about t he Lyran system which consisted of 9planets and 13 moons. The Lyrans, Aldebarans and Anunnaki are on very goodterms.The Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials are the offspring of a higher race (TheAnunnaki) which visited Earth hundreds of thousands of years ago, and createdthe earliest civilizations on Earth. Some lived on Earth for thousands of yearsbut eventually returned back to Aldebaran. Others got stuck on Earth and couldnot make it home. Consequently they lost their extraterrestrial genes, and beganto look like humans , gradually.Yet, they were very advanced and created wonders on Earth. Some were killed by the Great Deluge, and those who survived, returned after awhile to :Mount He rmon (Jabal Haramoun)BaalbeckLake VanUrartuDilmun (Ancient Bahrain )Hadramout ( Yemen )AnatoliaMesopotamiaHimalaya m ountainsTibet Scandinavia And to scattered islands in the Mediterranean .All are considered to be Aryans, even though the Anunnaki have black eyes andblack hair, with the exception of the higher cast of the Anunnaki which haslight black hair and blue eyes. *** *** ***[Image00115.jpg] The Trilithon of Baalbeck.[Image00116.jpg]The base of the Temple of Jupiter is called the Trilithon, and it is constructedof three 1200-tonne limestone megalithic stones. Legend has it, that the templewas constructed by a fleet of giants sent by Nimrod. An ancient Arab fable tellsus that the Afrit of King Solomon built the temple. The Anunnaki Ulema told usthat the Plateau of Baalbeck and its gigantic columns, including Hajarat AlHoublah are the work of the Anunnaki. _______________________Hajarat Al Houblah Name of the legendary massive stone located in Baalbeck , Phoenicia (Modern dayLebanon ), reportedly used by the Anunnaki for their Markabah (Super flyingmachine) launching center in ancient Phoenicia . Maria Orsic told us that Mt.Harmon and Baalbeck were a stargate for the extraterrestrials, and the beings oflights who survived the Great Deluge lived there for thousands of years. [Image00117.jpg]Hajarat Al Houblah in Baalbeck. The world’s longest, largest and heaviest carved stone. Few of those stones wereused as an Anunnaki spaceship s launching pad/terminal. No technology today canlift up this stone. [Image00118.jpg]Hajarat Al Houblah. An approximately 1,200- 1,500 tons stone known as “Hajarat Al Houblah” was usedin Baalbek’s Great Platform. According to Phoenician legend, stones like thisone were moved by the Anunnaki, usin g levitation, and teleportation; ananti-gravity system, frequently mentioned by Maria Orsic, and as part of theVril, which she defined as “Cosmic Energy”. _______________________________________ [Image00119.jpg] Ruins of Tushpa-van, the capital of kingdom of Urartu . The early Urartrians (Ancestors of the Armenians) were the remnants of theAdelbaran’s extraterrestrials, the offspring of the Anunnaki, Maria Orsicreferred to. _______________________________ [Image00120.jpg] Inscription on a brick from the Tower of Babel.Blockprint, Babylon, 604-562, Babylon. Some historians have associated the Temple of Marduk with the Tower of Babel.This association was never documented or substantiated. Maria Orsic told us thatthe extraterrestrials built huge edifices and monuements on Earth, includingBaalbeck Plateau, and the Great Pyramids, and their offsrpring continues withgigantic construct ions such as the Tower of Babel, and the Ramparts of Tyre. ___________________________Effects on humans upon arrival to Aldebaran-Ashtari ____________________ Maria ’s dream was to visit the extraterrestrials of Aldebaran. And she askedthem lots of questions about their habitats, lifestyle and whether she couldlive there with her Ladies of Vril. Here is a synopsis of what we already knowabout the physiological, psychological and emotional effects on humans uponarrival to Aldebaran-Ashtari . Upon Arrival:When a human being arrives to Ashtar i -Aldebaran for the first time, he or sheexperiences new physiological, emotional and psychological effects, as well aspsychosomatic reactions.The extraterrestrials told Maria (Similar account by Anunnaki Sinhar Anati) thatthe very first thing she will see when she steps out of the spaceship could bedescribed as a quantum jump into a world which looks like a sand storm on acompletely gray planet.At the very beginning, said the extraterrestrials to Maria, you will feelhorrible and becomes dizzy.It i s the atmosphere of our pla net that causes this.You need three days to adjust. The following is an excerpt from Anunnaki Sinhar Anati which perfectlyillustrates the situation, Maria will be in, the moment she enters th e world ofher extraterrestrial friends:The first thing the Aldebaran- Anunnaki extraterrestrials will do , is to takeyou to a bright room. A gentle person will show you the way to a bedroom.This person exchanges a few words with you and directs you to a very comfortablebed. And you will appreciate that , because by then you will be extremely tired,and you will sleep instantly. The next day you will wake up, and the treatmentof your sight begins. A person dressed in lilac will show you to a room with abasin filled with aquamarine-tinted fluid.This person will ask you to go in, relax, and think only about colors, nothingelse, preferably about one specific color, and this person would come back in anhour or so. The bathtub makes you feel good. The bathtub is perfumed with somefloral scent you will not recognize, but you will like a lot.For a while nothing happens, but after a few minutes, all of a sudden a streamof lavender light fills the basin and then lifts up and surrounds you like abeautiful web. At the same moment, a nd to your surprise, if on earth you hadany muscular or joint pain, it will totally disappear. All these are part ofadjusting your vision; they (Extraterrestrials) must cure all the weaknesses ofthe human body, genes, and all the possible disease s and sicknesses that youmight have in the future, in order to readjust your sight.On the second day, the same person (An extraterrestrial) leads you through aconnecting corridor to a surg ical room in another building. You will beintroduced to a nurse, or a physician, who will ask you to lie down on a table.A machine comes from the ceiling, shining a laser-like beam.The machine scans your brain, and the nurse will ask you to look at the screenon your right side to see how the cells in your brain would create new visualfaculties. This is absolutely amazing.You could actually see how your brain works. The nurse explains to you that manycells, millions of particles of your brains, were never used by you and now manyof them would become yours to use. After a short time, the nurse puts a soft butfirm bandage around your eyes and a metallic band or a belt around yourforehead.The band or the belt readjusts the level of energy and reactivates part of yourbrain’s cells. The band or the belt also develops a telepathic power in duetime.At a later day, you will be able to communicate telepathi cally with us.Pictures start to flow into your head and you don’t know where they come from.Some are the faces of other beings you have never met in your life. It is a verystrange feeling. You see faces and other things, but you do not hear sounds orvoices. And everything happens calmly without any mental or physical effort.When the treatment is over, your vision becomes perfect. And soon, you could goout and see the planet for the first time. Outside, the air is pure, and the skyis full of rainbows of colors. You have never seen such colors in your entirelife, because these colors do not exist on earth.Some of the colors of the sky blend with the colors of the landscape, giving youthe feeling that the ground is united with the sky.Then, you realize that something very strange is happening to you; your visionis no longer limited to straight lines. Now, you can see, magically, to the leftand to the right, like a surrounding vision.And you start to see more and more things; absolutely stunning buildingsglimmered under the brilliant sky, trees, bushes, and flowers everywhere andbeautifully dressed, smiling people walking in the streets. How different fromwhat you saw first, a gray planet with swirling sand in its atmosphere! Immediate human impression and reactions:Those who landed on the Aldebaran-Ashtari constellation for the first timeexperienced something very unique; an optical problem, a psyc ho-somaticvision/sight anomaly , more precisely, the inability of seeing.Temporarily they become totally blind. This phenomenon and how to regain sightwas described by Sinhar Ambar Anati. Note: Anati is describing what happened to her upon her arrival to Ashtari andshe is talking to her Anunnaki relatives.In her own words:“ Wh y can’t I see anything outside?It’s the atmosphere. There is no pollution, no smoke, no oil fuels, since pureelectromagnetic energy is all the Anunnaki use. It is so bright, so clear, thatit creates a strange effect on the human retina, which is accustomed todifferent conditions …When I woke up, my treatment began. Miriam (An Anunnaki female) took me to alittle room where she showed me a basin filled with aquamarine-tinted fluid.She asked me to go in, relax, and think only about colors, nothing else,preferably about one specific color. She would come back in an hour or so, shesaid, and the water will stay warm as long as I was in.I climbed into the bath which felt wonderful and was fragrant with some floralscent I did not recognize. I closed my eyes and thought about the colorlavender, beautiful, gentle soft kind of lavender.For a while nothing happened, but after a few minutes, all of a sudden a streamof lavender light filled the basin and then lifted and surrounded me like abeautiful web. To my surprise, at the same moment, a joint pain I developed onearth disappeared. It was in my ankle, which I have hurt a year ago whilerunning, and it did not heel properly, giving me occasional pain.I twisted it when I left the spaceship and stumbled, and it hurt when I woke upfrom my nap. Now it was perfectly well. Later they explained that as they adjustthe vision, they must cure all the weaknesses of the human body, my genes, andall the possible disease and sicknesses that I might have in the future. Even atmy young age I could feel the difference between the human condition and perfecthealth. On the second day, Miriam led me through a connecting corridor to asurgical room in another building.They have these corridors, connecting houses and buildings to each other, andthey never lock any doors.Such a trusting, simple lifestyle, such a pleasure.She introduced me to a nurse, or physician, who asked me to lie down on a table.I did, and a machine came from the ceiling, shining a laser-like beam.Apparently, they scanned my brain, and the nurse told me to look at the screenon my right side and see how the cells in my brain would create new visualfaculties. This was utterly amazing.I could actually see how the human brain worked! The nurse explained that manycells, millions of particles of the brains, are never used by humans, and nowmany of them would become mine to use. After a short time, the nurse put abandage around my eyes and a metallic band around my forehead.This was needed for readjusting the energy and reactivating part of the cells.They told me that this will not only adjust my vision, but will develop atelepathic power in due time. Indeed, to my great delight and astonishment, at a later day I was able tocommunicate telepathically with the Anunnaki, at will. When the treatment wascompleted, my vision was perfect, and Miriam told me that I could go out and seetheir world for the first time.” *** *** *** But who are the Anunnaki and their offspring the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials? _____________________ The Anunnaki I- The wrong definitions:For some reason, the word Anunnaki was incorrectly translated by some, as:“Those who Anu sent from heaven to earth.”“ Those who from heaven to earth came .” These definitions are not accurate, because they do not define the wordAnunnaki, but refer to where they came from, and who has sent them to Earth. Aproper definition should stay a definition, explaining the meaning in thesimplest, and clearest way, and not a personal interpretation or an elaborationon a word usually discussed in a “summary”, “characteristics”, or a sectionreserved to “what people have done.”If you want to define “New Yorker”, you would –I assume – simply say, a personwho is from New York , as simple as that. You do not say, “Those who GeorgeWashington sent from Virginia to New York ” or “those who from the mountains orthe plains of Georgia to New York came.” These two definitions have been blindly accepted by the masses, b ecause oftheir lack of knowledge of Akkadian-Sumerian-Old Babylonian languages.The Akkadian, Sumerian , Babylonian, Chaldean, and Assyrian word “Anu nnaki ” ,“An-nuki” (linguistically, etymologically, and epistemologically) does not referor indicate any of these: Those, heaven, came.Those two definitions are wrong; they are an interpretation or a representationof the Anunnaki’s arrival to Earth, rather than a definition. *** *** ***[Image00121.jpg]Ea “Enki” supreme god of the Anunnaki and father of the Aldebaran’sextraterrestrials (Offspring of the Anunnaki) stepping on a dry land, a gesturesymbolizing his supreme authority over Earth. Scene from a Babylonian cylinder seal showing Enki with two streams of wateremerging from his shoulders, and the Sumerian sun-god Utu (Shamash “The Sun God”in Akkadian, Shemesh in Phoenician).In the center, we see Inanna (Ishtar in Akkadian, Ashtaroot in Phoenician.) Thisscene shows Ea “Enki” stepping on a dry land, a gesture symbolizing his supremeauthority over Earth. The dry-land as depicted in this cylinder refers also toramparts protecting the cities of his kingdom. From the ramparts emerge a streamof fishes, symbol of all life-forms in the seas. Thus, his authority extends todry lands and seas of the Earth. ______________________________ [Image00122.gif] Map of the Adelbaran’s extraterrestrials and Anunnaki’s land inMesopotamia . The land of the Anunnaki in Mesopotamia , around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, and where their myths and epics were written in Akkadian on Sumerian claytablets.Other tablets and archaic inscriptions also documented their presence on Earth ,such Assyrian seals, Babylonian cylinders, Phoenician scriptures, and Ugariticpoems. _______________________________ II. The correct definition:a- Composition/origin of the word Anunnaki:The word Anunnaki is composed of three words , less or more, depending on thechoice of linguists , but the most correct linguistic compositions are asfollows:First composition: 1- Anu , which is the name of the Anunnaki’s supreme god. And theepistemological meaning of Anu is: Lord; leader; king. 2- Na, is either a verb or an adverb, meaning to send. In manyAkkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian and Old Babylonian texts and inscriptions, “Na” waswritten as “Ina”, and meant in, from within, so on. 3- Ki, generally means Earth in Akkadian and Sumerian. But Ki alsomeans all of the following, in Akkadian and Sumerian: The underworld, thenetherworld, the world of death.Thus, the general meaning becomes: The lord (or Lords) of Earth; the god (orgods) of Earth; the gods of the underworld. Second composition:C omposed from two words, such as: 1-Anunna, which means a group of deities (Gods and goddesses) inAkkadian and Sumerian languages. 2-Ki, which means earth and/or the underworld.Thus, the general meaning becomes: The goods of Earth; the gods of theunderworld.Many passages in the Cuneiform clay tablets clarified, explained, andestablished these facts.So there is no room for errors , different definitions, or personalinterpretations . b- Usage and differentiation of the word Anunnaki:The Akkadian/Sumerian Anunnaki word is used in a plural form to mean “Gods”, notto explain where they came from, who sent them, and where to ! The gods (from Earth and from Heaven) all together are called Anunnaki, and arerepresented as sh [Image00123.jpg] a sh [Image00123.jpg] amê (Sha Shame) uerSetim (Pronunciation: As Sha Shameh ersetiim) meaning the Anunnaki of heavenand earth. sh [Image00123.jpg] a sh [Image00123.jpg] amê means heaven inAkkadian and Sumerian. Shem and shama in Phoenician.Sham in Ulemite. Sham and Shama in Ana’kh. Sama in Arabic. It is very clear!erSetim means earth.In this category of “Group of deities” , Anunnaki and Igigi are groupedtogether. [Image00124.jpg] Babylonia, land of the Anunnaki , when it was captured by thePersians. ___________________________ Later on in history, and in order to differentiate between the Anunnaki and theIgigi,a- The scribes called the Anunnaki, the gods of Earth, also god s of thenetherworld, and the gods of the Empire of Death;b- The scribes called the Igigi, gods of Heaven (or heavens, skies)This differentiation is very clear in all the Mesopotamian clay tablets,particularly in the poem of “ Ishtar Descent to the Underworld ” (Ki), the epicof Gilgamesh and the Enuma Elish. Yet, in ancient esoteric writings, theAnunnaki were referred to as the “Shining Ones”, similar to Maria Orsic’expression “Beings of Light”. *** *** *** III. Other names of the Anunnaki:The Anunnaki were known to many neighboring countries in the Near East, MiddleEast , and Anatolia .And because of the languages’ differences, the Anunnaki were called differently.For instance: 1 -The Habiru (Early Hebrews/Israelites) called them Nephilim,meaning to fall down to earth, as well as Anakim. 2 - Some passages in the Old Testament refer to them as Elohim, andHa bene Elohim. 3 - In Ashuric (Assyrian-Chaldean), and Syriac-Aramaic, they arecalled Jabaariyn, meaning the mighty ones. 4 - In Aramaic, Chaldean and Hebrew, the Anunnaki as Gibborim meanthe mighty or majestic ones. 5 - In literary Arabic, it is Jababira. The early Arabs called themAl Jababira; sometimes Amalika. 6 - The Egyptians called them Neteru. 7 - The early Phoenicians called them An.Na Kim, meaning the go d orheaven who sent them to us. 8 - The early i nhabitants of Arwad called then Anu . ki, meaning thesubjects or followers of Anu. Sometimes, they were called Anu. Ki.ram. (Rammeans people, persons, community, tribes, group) 9 - The early Hyskos (Ancestors of the Armenians) who invaded andruled Egypt , called them the Anuramkir and Anuramkim, meaning the people of Anuon earth. It is composed of three words: Anu + ram (People) + Ki (Earth). Theprimitive form of Ki was kir or kiim . 10- The Greeks called them the Annodoti. 11- In the Book of Enoch, they are called t he Nephilim, \"The Sons ofGod,\" or the “Watchers”. 12 - The Ulema call them Annakh or Al Annaki, meaning the people fromabove. 13 -In other parts of Anatolia , and especially in the lands of theHittites, t he Anunnaki were also called Anunnaku , and Ananaki .Note:The primordial Phoenician meaning of Anunnaki was: Those who gave us life. Thismeaning derived for the formation of three ancient Phoenician words: a -An’kh (Life; god; spirit) , so the first part “An” is used, b -Nunnak (From within), c - The letter “i” is usually added to the end of a Semitic word or aname to mean one of the following: a -It belongs to; b -It came from; c -My. For instance, the word Ab means father in many Semitic languages (Assyrian,Sumerian, Aramaic, Arabic, etc.) When we add the letter “i” to Ab, it becomesAbi, which means MY father. The letter “i” adds a sense of belonging and origin.Later on in history, non-Semitic people and neighboring civilizations in theMiddle East, Near East, and Anatolia incorporated the letter i, in theirvocabularies.However, they attached to i, the letter g. And the new addition became “gi”,always meaning:a-Mine;b-My,c-Belongs to. *** *** *** View of ancient Babylonia . According to several linguists, the word Anunnaki is a loan word (P lural only)from Sumerian a.nun “n- a - k ”, meaning literarily : semen/descendants of the(A k) monarch (N un) and refers to the offspring of the king of h eaven An/Anum.Considered as a group of Akkadian and Sumerian deities, quite often, theAnunnaki were associated with the Annunna, meaning the fifty great gods. Annunawas written in various forms, such as: a- A -nun-na, b -Anu-na, c -Anuma-ki-ni, d -Anu-na-ki. Various attributes or definitions were given to them, such as: a -Major gods in comparison to the Igigi who were considered minorgods. b -Those of a royal blood or ancestry. c -The royal offspring, d -The great gods of heaven and earth. An means heaven, and ki meansearth. e -The messengers or subjects of god/king Anu. f- The children of Anu and Ki. Babylonia - View of Babylonia [Image00125.jpg]The early Anunnaki had strong relations with the Sum erians, the Phoenicians,the Hy k s os, the Philistines, the Etruscans, the Druids, the Minoans, and theArwadians.The Annunaki appeared prominently in the Babylonian creation myth/epic, “ EnumaElish [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish] ” .In the late version, glorifying Marduk [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk] ,after the creation of mankind, Marduk divides the Anunnaki and assigns them todiverse parts of the earth. According to later Babylonian myth[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mythology] s, the Anunnaki were thechildren of Anu [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu] and Ki[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki_%28goddess%29] , brother and sister gods,themselves the children of Anshar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshar] andKishar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishar] . And Anshar[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshar] and Kishar[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishar] were the children of Lahm and Lahmu[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahmu] , names/titles bestowed upon thegatekeepers of the Abzu [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu] temple at Eridu[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eridu] , sometimes referred to as “Chimiti” the genetic lab/site of the Creation[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_%28theology%29] . *** *** *** Revelations by Anamidra __________________________ I. Definition and introduction:Anamidra is the n ame of the Anunnaki scientist who monitors the Earth Matrix,called Anamid-Raya, also Anid Ariya.This Matrix is extremely complicated , because it is written in codes, symbols,geom etrical forms, chemical formulae , theorems, “and in all the languages thathave existed, still exist, and will be invented in the future after 2022,” saidthe Ulema.In other words, it is a cosmic library, archives, and depository of all theknowledge and events of 5 billions years, the estimated date of the beginning ofEarth. II. Anamidra and Earth Matrix:Anamidra provided fascinating and mind-bending information in this m atrix thathave captivated academicians and leading scientists in the Eastern and Westernhemispheres. Included in his data are detailed descriptions and explanations of: 1 -Primordial bio-engineering of terrestrial lifeforms (Elements,nature, animals, and humans); 2 -Building blocks of life, and how they acted like cells to producelife on earth; 3 -DNA’s fifth unknown element; 4 -RNA (Humans and non-humans) and life evolution; 5 -The origin and the genetic creation of the human races by theAnunnaki; 6 -The Earth-made human creatures; 7 -The Space-made human creatures; 8 -Metabolism and the oceans-made human creatures; 9 -Man-made humans and reverse engineering of the human brain; 10 -The Anunnaki’s “Conduit”. III. Anamidra explains what kind of clay, the Anunnaki used to create Man:One of the most striking revelations of Sinhar Anamidra is his explanation ofthe “Clay” used by the Anunnaki to genetically create the first human species.The Anunnaki’s m atrix mentioned clay as one of the primordial ingredients orelements they have used to create the human race. It is extremely important tounderstand the real meaning of the word clay.Anamidra explained to the Ulema, that “Cl ay ” is not what everybody understoodor thought to be, from reading the translations of the Sumerian texts. It is notthe earthly clay found in ancient Sumer near the Tigris and Euphrates banks. TheAnunnaki’s m atrix explained and defined it very differently. Judaism,Christianit y and Islam got hooked on clay. S cholars who have translated theSumerian texts and/or interpreted them made a huge mistake when they referred toclay as the mud or dirt substance the Anunnaki found in ancient Iraq, and mixedit with their DNA to create mankind …” said Ulema Govinda. The Anunnaki used aplasmic liquid that coagulated very rapidly, and short after, the coagulationtook the apparent physical properties of the clay. But the substance was notdirt, rather plasmo-organic. III. Anamidra explains the creation of Man from cosmic clay:Anamidra told the Ulema, that s ome of the very early human races were notcreated by the Anunnaki. The earliest human-animal species were originallycreated in space , and this included many animals and various plants. The lifeof the earliest human-animal species started within the clay found insidecomets. IV. Anamidra spoke about the early human species who lived underwater:Anamidra spoke to the Anunnaki-Ulema about the existence and origin of earlyhuman-like creatures who lived at the bottom of the oceans. He explained that“one of the earliest life-forms on planet Earth began at the very bottom of theoceans, where metabolism originated through “Mai-ai” (Water) . Metabolismcreated an early human-like form. Those creatures had a human skull, two eyeswithout retina, two legs and four long arms, but no nose, no ears , and no hairon their bodies.” They were called the Basharma’h. (Bashar means human race, andMa’h means water.) IV. Early intelligent lifeforms who lived inside Earth:These lifeforms produced intelligent creatures who inhabited severalintraterrestrials regions, and were extremely advanced. They were known to theancient Greeks.Maria Orsic , the Ladies of Vril and Thule members believed in a race thatinhabited a “Hollow-Space” inside Earth.[Image00126.jpg] Maria explains the worldof extraterrestrialsMaria explains t he world of extraterrestrialsIn no particular order________________________ Ethics:Aldebaran and Ash.Ta.Ri extraterrestrials live in a world our human logic andmind can’t understand. Although the y (The extraterrestrials) do not practiceany religion , their sense and understa nding of ethics, justice, good a nd evildeeds, and merits are well developed. They see the universe, the development ofthe mind and a person’s character quite differently from the way we do.They take into a great consideration the consequences of an act, even aminiscule thought. They don’t have courts of law, trials, tribunals,prosecutors, judges, lawyers and corporal punishment, but they have establishedrules that govern behavior, merits, deeds, and social justice.“ Their families, parents, children, relatives, and members of their communitiesare guided by social ethics and a moral law , far superior to our laws andreligions…they have families like us…they feel like us…they work together in aperfect harmony, using a collective awareness shared by all…” said Maria.(Note: This is exactly what Sinhar Anati said, and which I have published in oneof my books on the Anunnaki.) Worth mentioning here what Ulema Najani said on the subject:“The Anunnaki have families, fathers, mothers, and children too, and they followfamilial hierarchy, and family morality rules as we do here on Earth…”Anunnaki Ulema Albard said, “Unlike other extraterrestrial races and speciesthat are not built around family structure and parental bonds, the Anunnaki livewithin their own families perimeter, and show feelings and emotional reactionsas we do…” He added, “The head of a living unit or a family is the father.However, the family is always placed under the direct guidance of a mother.Anunnaki society is matriarchal.” Karma, Body’s Cells and the Extraterrestrial Mind:The word “Karma” does not exist in their vocabulary, for they don’t have theconcept of reincarnation. Even tho ugh, physical death does not exist in theirworld, as we understand death on earth, all reach a point when and where the last cell of energy in their bodies ceases to function, thus resulting in thedeterioration of their cells .“After t he deterioration of their cells… after they have lived for hundreds ofthousands of years, their physical body that they were currently using fadesaway, but their mind recreates itself as a new copy of the physical body,because, each one of them has a multitude of copies of their body.They can activate and reactivate the last fully functional and healthy cell ofthe Vril (In this context, by Vril, Maria meant the quasi-eternal cosmic energyof the self, including the universe), and reproduce it in a large quantity, andactivate each newly created cell separately, thus recreating many copies ofthemselves, and restore them in a reversed eternal time storage.On A lde baran, I will never age, and my mind will grow healthier and wiser…”said Maria. Aldebaran ’s Akashic Library:Learning from the Adelbaran’s Extraterrestrials and Anunnaki:“I am not afraid to go to A ldeb aran, Jamara (Name of a planet rotating intheir constellation) and Nimra (Another planet), for they (Extraterrestrials)told me that everything is going to be fine. Heike was concerned because wedon’t know their language and their habits. But they told me once we are there,they will re-construct our minds and bodies, and we will never suffer again orget sick. Their world is peaceful and beautiful. They will teach me many newthings and I will learn about the greatest secrets in the universe…I will haveaccess to their universal libraries which contains the Akashic records of theuniverse. I found Maria’s statements mind-bending, because they mirror what exactly theEnlightened Anunnaki Ulema told us centuries ago. The Honorable Mastersexplained to us that t he Anunnaki and Aldebaran Akashic Library is not alibrary in the traditional sense, because it contains no physical books onshelves .E ach one of them (Extraterrestrials) has access to the global Akashic Record sthrough the Akashic l ibraries, which are located in every community.One enters through a huge door that is never closed, day and night. It opensinto a huge hall, seven hundred to one thousand meters in length, by fivehundred meters in width.The hall is empty of any furniture, and is lit by windows that are placed veryhigh, near the ceiling. The windows were designed in such a way that the shaftsof light that enter through them are very sharply delineated and look like solidbeams of light. At night, the same effect is achieved by enormous spot lightsplaced near the windows. The effect is incredibly effective. Extremely large billboards hang on eachwall. On the floor in front of each billboard are hundreds of pads. Whenvisitors enter the library, they approach the billboard, stand each on a pad,and think about their destination within the building.The pad has the capacity to read minds, and as soon as it does so, it begins tomove, and it slides right through the billboard, which is not really solid butis made of a form of energy, carrying the visitor with it.Behind the billboard is the main hall of the Akashic Library, called Mad-Khal.The visitors find themselves in the presence of an immense screen, composed of amaterial not found on Earth. The screen is hard to describe; it can be comparedto a grid, with a multitude of matric es and vortices of data. The s creen is contacted through the Conduit which is located in the brain’scells. The screen can read minds, and it knows right away what information thevisitors seek. All what the visitors have to do is stand still in front of thescreen, and the data will be displayed in sequences. Of course, the data is notrepresented by lines, sentences, or paragraphs, but rather by codes.Each code contains particular information related to an aspect of the subject.For example, if you would like to visit Iraq , 2,000 A .D., Iraq 300 B.C., orIraq 2,008 B.C., all you have to do is to focus on these dates, and three codeswill appear on the screen waiting for your command to open them up.From this moment on, the Conduit located in your brain and the Screen arecommunicat ing in the most direct fashion. The three files (T he nearestdescription of these files would be to call them digital, for the lack of theproper word) will open up. Each one will contain everything that had happenedpertaining to that particular date in Iraq .The Conduit will sort out, classify, and index the particular data for the partof the information the visitor is most interested in.Then, the information will be stored automatically in the cells of the visitor’sbrain, increasing the size of the depot of knowledge in the brain.And because Anunnaki are connected to each other and to their community via theConduit , the data recently absorbed is sent to other Anunnaki to share it,which is extremely beneficial, since if the data received from the screen isdifficult to understand, the Anunna ki community called Jama, or an individualAnunnaki, will send, also automatically, the explanation needed. This is quite similar to an online technical support on earth, but it is muchmore efficient since it functions brain-to-brain. Each Anunnaki community havethe same kind of center for these mirrors of knowledge which are the Akashicfiles. The complexity of the centers though, is not the same.Some of the Akashic Libraries include more perplexing and complicatedinstruments and tools, which are not readily available to other communities. These tools include the monitor, w hich is also called mirror or Miraya in Ana ’kh. Each Miraya is under the direct control of a Sinhar ( A leader), who servesas custodian and guardian.It is very important to protect the privacy of every member of the community,because individual s could attem pt to tap into the data of the Miraya and haveaccess to the codes of the telepathic communication of other s , thus enablingthem to read the mind of all the community members, something that is consideredhighly unethical and absolutely must be avoided. The screens, by the way, can expand according to the number of codes that theresearcher is using. Seven to ten codes are normal. If more codes than that areopened, the screen is fragmented into seven different screens, which are onlyvisible to the mind. An amazing phenomenon occurs at this moment; time and spacemingle together and become unified into one great continuum. This enables theresearcher to grasp all the information in a fraction of a second.An added convenient aspect of the Akashic files is the ability of the researcherto access them in the complete privacy of the researcher’s home or office, sincepart the files can be teleported there. But since the private screen is not ascomplicated as the central one in the Central Library, no multiple screen willopen up, only the original one. It is important to understand that the datareceived is not merely visual. There is much more to it than that.By the right side of the screen, there are metallic compartments as thin asparchment paper, which serve as a cosmic audio antennae, called Min-Zar .These compartments search for, and bring back, any sound that occ urred inhistory, in any era, and on any planet. And this is just a minor part of it,because it brings additional sounds from other dimensions, and para-galacticcivilizations (T errestrials and extraterrestrials). According to the extraterrestrials , every single sound or voice is never lostin the universe. The voice is never lost, because it is energy and it stays inthe perimeter of its sphere, call it for now, atmosphere, space, etc. TheAnunnaki combined asset of the visual and audio systems provided by the s creen,gives anybody the ability to learn languages afforded by the Akashic Library.This applies to any language – past, present or future, and from any part of theuniverse. The researcher can call up a shining globe of light that will swirl on thescreen with enormous speed. As it rotates, the effect blends with an audiotransmission that comes from the metallic compartments.In an instant, any language will sink into the brain’s cells. On the left sideof the screen, there are conic compartments that bring still images of certainimportant past events. This mini-screen-display informs the researcher thatthese particular events cannot be altered.In other words, the Anunnaki cannot go back in the past and change it. TheAnunnaki are forbidden to change or alter the events, or even just parts orsegments of past events represented on the conic compartment, because theseimages represent events created by the Anunnaki themselves.This restriction works as a security device, an essential one. For example, ayoung Anunnaki cannot visit planet Earth sixty five thousand years ago, enterthe genetic lab of the Anunnaki in Sumer or Phoenicia , and change the DNA andthe genetic formula originally used by Sinhar Enki, or Sinhar Anu, to create thehuman race, or the seven prototypes of the human race created by Sinhar Inanna. Sinhar Inanna herself can go back and change it, but not for use on earth as weknow it. She has to transpose it and transport it to another dimension, parallelto the original dimension where the event occurred. This safeguard means thatSinhar Inanna cannot recreate a new race on our earth by sending us, the currentliving humans, sixty five thousand years ago back in time, remoulding us, andthen bringing us back to the twenty first century as new specie, or a new race.This would be unethical. All she could do would be to recreate her ownexperiment in another dimension. For instance, Inanna can go back 2,000 years in time and space, reconstruct theDNA of Jesus Christ and create a new Jesus. But the new Jesus will not exist onthe map of year 1, or return to Bethlehem to be re-born again. He will betransported as a grown man to another dimension not very much different from thePalestine Jesus knew. Before the extraterrestrials’ screen in the hall of the Akashic Records, moreoptions are available for research, and one of them is a sort of browsing.Inside the screen, there is a slit where the mind of the extraterrestrial canenter as a beam.This will open the “Ba’abs”, or Stargates, to other worlds that the researcheris not even aware of, but appeared randomly as part of the discovery orexploration.In each slit there is another Akashic file that belongs to other universes,worlds, dimensions, and civilization s , sometimes more advanced than theAldebaran’s people and Anunnaki themselves, where the researcher can eitherretrieve important information, and/or witness the creation of the future. It is like going back in the future, because everything that exists in thepresent, or shall occur in the future, has already occurred in a distant pastand needed time to surface and appear before the eyes of the extraterrestrials. The term Akashic is herewith used because many of us are familiar with what itmeans and represents , and to a certain extent refers to the contents ofhistorical events and thoughts recorded in “human history.” In the Aldebaran-Anunnaki context, it is the record of cosmic events thatoccurred in multiple galaxies. The reason it is called the Akashic /CosmicLibrary is because it has equipment that allows the researcher to connect to theAkashic /Cosmic Records; the vast compendium of knowledge encoded in anon-physical plane of existence, in a substance that is called Akasha.In Ana’ kh, it is called Ab.Har, or simply Har . *** *** *** And what is Ana’kh, the script Maria Orsic received telepathically from theextraterrestrials? _____________________ Ana’kh is the language of the Anunnaki and the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials whodescended on Sumeria and Phoenicia according to the Ulema.It is of an extraterrestrial origin.Part of the Anakh language lexicon i s preserved in the Book of Ram a d osh, andin Al Hak; a manuscript in the custody of the Ulema. Ulema Albakr stated that Anakh was used by early human beings who lived on theIsland of Arwad , in Tyre , Sidon and Mu. He added that from the Ana’kh derivedthe primitive languages of the Near East and the Middle East .Many words in Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, Coptic, Phoenician, Akkadian, Hittite,Babylonian, Urdu, Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Arabic, Hungarian, Egyptian, Armenian,Enochean, Nabatean, and Aramean derived from the Anakh.Many of the original words of this language, as well as numerous linguisticderivat ions are included in this book. Ana’kh was never made public.It remained a secret language known only to the Ulema, and later on to theAllamah.Anakh sounds Semitic, because of its phonetics. But it is “not Semitic at all”,said Ulema Ghandar Gupta. It has no grammar, but it has an extremely rich invocabulary and an abund ance of metaphoric expressions. Another Ulema said, thatthe original name of Jehovah or Yahweh derived from the Anakh word Yaw. Also, aconsiderable number of Akkadian and Sumerian words that appeared in the SumerianEpic of Creation derived from the Ana’kh. Around 569 A .D., a group of Ulema in the Near East (Non-Islamic scholars)compiled an extensive list of Ana’kh words and phrases.In 625, A .D., two leading figures of the Ulema brot herhood wrote the Book ofRamad osh; a compilation of Ana’kh terminology, a lexicon, and Kiraats (Readings ). Ulema Albaker stated that the Ulema is not a religious group.They are not Muslim. In fact, they were persecuted by the companions of theProphet Muhammad, and were expelled from the Arab Peninsula . They found refugein Cyprus and Marseille.But he was quick to point out that the early Sufi masters, poets and Sufi trancedancers were Ulema. He added that Ulema should not be confused with the Islamic Ulema who teachIslamic law, or with the Allamah who were the leading Islamic figures of scienceand letters in medieval times.Dr. Farid Tayarah, an Ulema himself, and a former head of a Masonic Lodge statedthat the Ana’kh was used during Masonic sessions.He added that a considerable number of Masonic words and expressions are pureAna’kh, especially those words referring to levels and degrees in Freemasonry.It is an intriguing situation to say the least. *** *** *** Ana’kh words in Semitic an d ancient non-Semitic languages_____________________ Ana’kh , the Adelbaran extraterrestrials and Anunnaki language had a majorlinguistic and epistemological influence on the languages of the ancient world,as well as upon the civilization, culture and religions of the ancient Near East, and Middle East , including but not limited to the Phoenicians, Sumerians,Assyrians, Akkadians, Chaldeans, Babylonians, Mesopotamians, Copts, Hittites,Egyptians, Arabs, and Hebrews. Many of the Ana’kh words entered the early languages of those civilizations, andfrom the original Ana’kh, derived thousands of ancient Semitic and non-Semiticwords and expressions, some very noticeable in Akkadian/Sumerian epics such asthe Epic of Gilgamesh, and Enuma Elish, as well as in the Epic of the PhoenicianCosmogony.For instance: 1 -The Ana’kh word “ Ab”, meaning father became Ab in Arabic, Ab uand Abuya in Aramaic, Abba in Hittite, so on.  2 - The Ana’kh word Baa-ni. Ana’kh/Ulemite. Architect; designer;builder.From Baa-ni, derived the Assyrian word Bani and the Arabic Bani or Al-Bani,which means a builder; an architect.Sinhar Marduchk said: “Fi baa-ni arda imanu.” Translated verbatim: “In thebuilder, I planted my trust.” From the Book of Rama-Dosh.Fi means in. Baa-ni means builder or architect. Arda means I put, planted. Imanumeans trust; confidence.From the Ana’kh Arda, derived the Hebrew word Eretz, and the Arabic word Ardwhich mean earth, or soil. And from the Ana’kh Imanu, derived the Arabic andUlemite Iman, which means trust; faith.  3 - The Ana’kh word Badan : Reverence. From Badan, derived theAssyrian and Persian Abadan and Appadan which mean temple; a place of worship; ashrine.Arabic linguists claim that the Persian Apadan (Appadan) is derived from theArabic Abidin (Worshipers) and/or from Abada or Ibada (Act of worship). WhilePersian linguists assert that the Arabic words Abada, Ibada and Abidin derivedfrom the Iranian Apadan.Here is a historical reference taken from the Inscriptions of Artaxerxes: “Agasum Apadan Dariyauz abu abi abi-ya itebus.” Translated verbatim: “This namedApadan Darius my great grandfather made.”Worth mentioning here that the ancient Persian word Apadana means temple, and itwas used hundreds of years before the words Abada or Ibada were incorporated inthe Islamic Arabic vocabulary, including the Quran and Hadith Sharif (Dialoguesor speech of the Prophet Mohammad.)  4 - The Ana’kh expression Baliba nahr usu na Ram.Translated verbatim: “The water of the river purified my people.” Attributed toSinhar Marduchk in the Book of Rama-Dosh. Baliba means flows of waters. Nahrmeans river (Same meaning in Hebrew, Phoenician and Arabic).Usu means to clean or purify.Na means my or our.Ram means people (Same meaning in Phoenician, primitive Arabic, early Armenianand ancient Hebrew).The Ana’kh word “Usu” also means to dig.We find similar meaning in the Annals of Sardanapalus: “Nahrtu istu nahr zabaanta ahri nahr babilat kanin sumsa abbi.” Translated verbatim: “A river from theupper Zab I dug and its name I called.”  5 - The Ana’kh word Gibishi: Power. From Gibishi, derived the Assyrian word Gibis , which means might; power; strength.It did appear in the Akkadian and Sumerian clay tablets. “Mili kassa mee rabuti kima gibis tihamti usalmi.”-Nebuchadnezzar. Translated verbatim: “A collection of great water like the might of the sea Icaused add it.”“In gibis libbi-ya u suskin galli-ya er asibi.”-From the Annals of Sardanapalus.Translated verbatim: “In the strength of my heart, and steadfastness of myservants, I besieged the city.”“Ana gibis ummani-su mahdi ittagil.”-From the Obelisk of Nimrud . Translatedverbatim: “To the powers of his great army he trusted.”“”Ina gibis emuqi sa Asur bil-ya.”-From the Annals of Tiglath Pileser.Translated verbatim: “In the boundless might of Assur my lord.”So on… *** *** ***Chapter 4Answers to Questions on Your Mind ____________________ 1- Q: Why did Maria and members of Thule and D HvSS keep the project of building the Vril secret?A: The a mazing aspect of the Orsic-Vril story resides in part in the secrecy ofits co nstruction.Why did many of the members of Thule and DHvSS who have invested in the project,and were pro-war, pro-Hitler and some were extremely fanatic Nazis hid Maria’sspacecraft from Albert Speer, Himmler and the Luftwaffe? To many of us, this is incomprehensible! Even absurd. Not really.They kept everything secret for many reasons: Portrait [Image00127.jpg] Berthold Konrad Hermann Albert Speer.In 1934, Speer became Hitler's chief architect, minister of German armaments in1942, and German armaments and war production minister in 1943 .To name a few: First reason: They knew that once Heinrich Himmler becomes aware of theexistence of the craft, he will take over, confiscate the machine, and kick themout. Second reason: Many believed that Maria’s machine could be used after the war asa supersonic transatlantic airplane which would generate lots of profits; afterall, it was a revolutionary invention, a fantastic airplane unmatched andunrivaled in its concept, speed and originality.Grosso modo, they wanted to protect their investment. Third reason: Many still believed that Maria’s aircraft was not 100% reliable,and if Himmler controls the project, and finds out that it is not working theway he wanted to work, this lunatic will eliminate them without any hesitation,for he was known for his cruelty, and viciousness in treating other engineersand scientists who either failed in SS’s assigned projects, or did not producethe kind of results Himmler expected; the man was a monster, he killed numerousscientists who in his wicked and twisted mind did not deliver.So, the fear of being killed by Heinrich Himmler was one of the major reasonsfor keeping the project top secret. Fourth reason: They knew that Speer has began nationalizing private companiesand factories and enlisting civilian engineers; Thus, their machine, efforts,investment and especially their freedom will be totally absorbed by Hitler’s warmachine. Fifth reason: This last reason came much later in this saga.Those who became aware of how things behind the curtain, and on the battlefieldsstarted to shift in the favor of the Allies, began to think very seriously abouttheir survival; their lives were on the line, and the only way to get the hellout of Germany before it collapses, was to jump in t his damned aircraft and flyto one of the destinations they had in mind, such as Argentina, Venezuela, Peru,Chile, Ecuador and Brazil. In this context, the aircraft was their safetyblanket. *** *** *** 2- Q: Are the Aldebaran ’s people (beings of light) Anunnaki or anextraterrestrial race similar to the Anunnaki?A: They are the offspring of the Anunnaki. *** *** *** 3- Q: Did the Aldebaran people speak Sumerian?A: Yes. But they used Ana’kh (Anunnaki language) and an old Babylonian dialectidentical to Sumerian when they sent their messages to Maria. *** *** *** 4 - Q: Are they multi-dimensional or something else?A: Multi-dimensional. *** *** *** 5 - Q: Why a highly advanced galactic community, perhaps billions of years aheadof us would contact a ninteen year blond girl from Germany, instead of Hitlerhimself, the master of Germany, the Pope or the President of the United States?A: Maria was not contacted by the leaders of the Aldebaran.Ulema Anunnaki Sorenztein explained the reason. He said, “It is vital andimportant to understand that extraterrestrials might contact some of us.But this does not mean that their contact was initiated by their leaders,governing organism or they are talking on behalf of their entire race inisolated contacts, and messages sent to contactees.We have radio’s amateurs around the globe.At one time, it was a big deal to use a long or short wave radio to contactpeople from around the world, while sitting in a garage or around a kitchendining table. And it was fun and exciting too. Quite often, “individual extraterrestrials” or an “independent groups ofextraterrestrials” contact other extraterrestrials and evem humans, just for funor to socialize.Nothing is unusual about this. Especially if these extraterrestrials aregenetically similar (To a certain degree) to the human race.Remember, life duplicates itself in an incomprehensible manner throughout theuniverse, and numerous civilizations who share the immensity of the universeressemble us on biological and molecular levels.*** *** *** 6 - Q: Did the Aldebaran’s people rescue Maria Orsic when Heinrich Himmlerissued an order to shoot her?A: We don’t know. But obviously they did help her to get out of Germany. Mariaexplained exactly what they did. *** *** *** 7 - Q: Life 0n Aldebaran: Do those extraterrestials live like us? Do they havefamilies, kids, puppies, music, a social structure, or they are simplynon-biological entities, totally diferent from us?A: The answer i s provided on page 165. *** *** *** 8 -Q: Are they coming back?A: Yes, in 2022. *** *** *** 9 - Q: Is Maria’s Vril-UFO a real UFO?A real Merkabah, the Anunnaki spaceship we are familiar with, and which wasreferred to in ancient scriptures and the Bible as the “God’s Chariot”?A: Yes, it is a superflying physical machine which resembles the Anunnaki’sMerkabah. Is it identical? Nobody knows. *** *** *** 1 0 - Q: And did the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials really give Maria a technicaldata on how to build this UFO-Chariot thing?A: Yes they did, and based upon that technical data, Maria’s spaceship wasbuilt. *** *** *** 1 1- Q: Why didn’t the extraterrestrials from Adelbaran speak to Maria inGerman? This could and would have simplified lots of things to Maria and to theLadies of Vril, and made the situation clearer?A: I agree. And I don’t know. *** *** *** 1 2- Q: Of course, they communicated with her telepatically, but is telephaticcommunication a mental projection limited to images and voices only, or muchmuch bigger , more varied, and more important than that, thus containingtransmission of knowledge and wisdom in a multitude of forms and languages,including German, for instance?A: It is all of the above, expect that telepathy does not need the mastery of alanguage to make a mental communication possible. *** *** *** 1 3- Q: Is Maria Orsic still alive?A: Yes, but not on Earth. *** *** *** 14-W hy Walter and Reinmar Horten the legendary designers of Horten 229, and whohad access to Maria’s UFO technical data did not build an Aldebaran UFO whenthey fled to Germany, and instead, they designed very ordinary passengers’airplanes, and one type of military jets for Peron? Why passengers and cargoairplanes an d not real UFOs??And why Peron’s airlines consisted of DC-3 and DC-4, instead of super flyingmachines?It is well-known that Juan Peron modernized the Argentinian Air force between1947 and 1950, and Argentinian engineers produced Pulqui I and Pulqi II(Designed by Kurt Tank, a German scientist), two highly advanced jet aircrafts,which reach a speed of 1000 kilometers per hour, and later the IA 58 Pucara andthe IA 63 Pampa, but I don’t see UFOs here!!What did happen to Maria Aldebaran technical data?A: The Horten brothers promissed Maria to never duplicate her spaceship.However, part of her Aldebaran’s technical data was used by American scientistswho worked on one type of UFO, and they succeeded in their efforts. 15 - Q: Is it true that after the United States Air Force, the DefenseDepartment and the CIA have cancelled the Avro Project Y, renamed “Weapon System606 A”, “ Avrocar” and “VZ-9AV” (The first American-Canadian UFO), continuedsecretely to build Maria’s UFO in Area 51, and Wright Field, outside Dayton,Ohio, and a UFO prototype was shipped to NASA’s Ames Research Center at MoffettField, California?A: YES!!!!!!! *** *** *** 16 - Q: Were our first UFOs built according to Adelbar an-Orsic technical dataand extraterrestrial messages ?A: Absolutely! *** *** *** 17 - Q: An did engineer John Frost, the mind behind the Avro UFO use MariaOrsic-Aldebaran technical data to build the first Canadian-UFO, under theguidance of Lt. Colonel Horten, a friend of Maria Orsic?A: Yes!*** *** *** 18 - Q: And why some of the notes of Mr. Frost were written in a scriptressembling cuneiform inscriptions?A: Because originally, Maria’s data was written in cuneiform and Ana’kh. *** *** *** 19- And what were the questions of the United States Air Force and the CIA aboutthe cryptic Sumero-Akkadian-Ugaritic notes of Mr. Frost?A: They did not ask questions!They already knew about Maria’s Sumerian-Ana’kh script since the end of WorldWar Two. *** *** *** 20 - Q: Did Maria reach Aldebaran ?A: Maria said that they were waiting for her at the 33.33 degree stargate line.This leads me to believe that it is possible. *** *** *** 21 - Q: Did the contacts and messages between Maria Orsic and the Aldebaranextraterrestrials change any of our conceptions or understanding of the universeand the world we live in?A: Yes to few. None whatsover for the skeptics and all those who do not believein extraterrestrials and UFOs. *** *** ***[Image00128.jpg][Image00129.jpg]Chapter 5Maria Orsic’s Predictions _________________________ 1. A clash between us and an aggressive alien race is inevitable. 2. A Third World War is inevitable. It will be fought from above. Humanity willbe decimated. But the human race will survive. 3. All the people of the Earth will witness the return of the Beings of Light(Extraterrestrials). They will return to Earth before or in 2022. Major changeswill occur on many levels. But the nature of humans will not change completely. 4. America will rise as the most powerful country in the world, and it will lastfor very very long time. 5. Before the end of the 21 st century, millions of people are going to die in amatter of a few days. Their death will be caused by frightening clouds of ashesthat would cover the entire sphere of Earth.This is a major apocalyptic event, and it is the direct result and consequencesof humanity’s greed and selfishness.It is regrettable. 6. By the mid of the 22 nd century, all the meeting points and stations(Stargates) on the 33 .33 degree line will be activated. And expectcivilizations from other worlds to visit us on a regular basis. By then, ourknowledge of the universe, space and time will allow us to easily visit fardistant planets and stars in the unknown universe. It is the beginning of a newhistory for all of us. History is written from above. 7. Earth will be ruled by a new breed of women. 8. Europe will be united as an economic block, and adopt a new monetary system.But Europe ’s infrastructure, and the ways of life of its people will remain thesame. It could be a good change, and it could affect world’s affairs.But it will not change the world. For the world will only change when theextraterrestrials return to Earth. 9. Germans will continue to manufacture super flying machines (UFOs) but outsideGermany . However, they will not last for long. Another country will take over.(Note: Did she mean the United States ? It is not clear.) 10. Germany will be divided into pieces. 11. Germany will loose the war before the end of 1945. 12. My days are numbered on Earth. I have the feeling that I am not going to beable to accomplish my mission.This is an internal feeling, I hope I am wrong. 13. Organized religions will become frail relics of the past. And as science andtechnology advance, people of the Earth will meet super beings from othergalaxies.And they will learn great things. And they will discover their true nature. Andreligions built upon power will vanish. 14. Within two centuries, t he human race will land on other planets andestablish habitats with different species.

(She was vegetarian)  The Nazis never trusted me; and it was mutual.  Adelbaran is a beautiful place, simply because there is no greed andno violence on Adelbaran.  I am not special. I am simply lucky, I just entered their zone bypure coincidence, and I never knew how. (Talking about why and show she was ableto communica te with the extraterrestrials and vice versa)  They are beautiful and they glow . (Talking about the Adelbaran’sextraterrestrials)  My days are numbered on Earth. I live on a borrowed time. (She knewthat by 1945 she will be leaving Earth)  Lust destroys creativity.  You can fully tr ust people who care for animals; cats, dogs andpigeons, especially pigeons. (She was an animal-lover)  Father Konrad said Himm ler l ooks funnier than his chickens. This isan insult to chickens. (Father Konrad is Father Konrad Fuchs who upo n askinghis opinion about Mari a, said: “Not all saints are Catholics.”)  Professor Schumann is the most honorable man I have ever met. Hedidn’t argue; he explored. And he didn’t criticize; he accepted the possibilitythat he could be wrong. This is why he had a brilliant mind, and a noblecharacter. I am sad he was not chosen to accompany me to Adelbaran.  The beings of lights (Extraterrestrials) told me how sad they werefor not creating us perfect…and they became sadder because they gave us all thepossibilities and opportunities to do it on our own, and we didn’t .  I was guided when I drew the sketches (Drawings of her spacecraft) .They are important to me because they are my link to the beings of lights andhumanity’s better future.  On reaching higher dimensions: Those who are lucky enough to be takento the planet of the beings of lights (Aldebaran’s extraterrestrials) will livefor ever; their mind and body will remain intact and will acquire propertieswhich will allow the m to transcend time and space. They will never age, theywill never suffer again and their essence will constantly be upgraded, andmetamorphosed into higher beings. And the unfortunate ones will die. But theywill be given a 40 day period after their death to decide whether they want toremain in the “neutral zone of nothingness” or elevate themselves to a higherdimension. Thus, humans’ fate is not the same for all of us. And each one of uswill have a chance to progress. It is simply a matter of choice.  On c ontact with extraterrestrials: Contact is possible only if theextraterrestrials tune you in; there are particular times to communicate withaliens. You can’t do it on your own.  S ex is what ruined the human race , and alienated us from ourcreators. Sex is the most destructive weapon people have at their disposal.  You can’t be a medium if you work for somebody else.  The Vril cosmic power is within all of us. Search for it inside yourheart.  “So long my friend, I leave with you a big part of my heart…”(Talking to Dr. Schumann, when she saw him for the last time.)  Goodness and happiness are hard to find, but they are duplicated inthe other world and you will have plenty of time to enjoy them….only if beforeyou leave this Earth, you will remember to forgive, to sing a beautiful song,and feed your pet…  Our civilizations would last longer, only if we could share oursuccess with others.  Stay away from organized religions, if you want to learn the truthand walk into the light.  I am leaving behind a distorted history of humanity and atrocitiescommitted by the name of God. How delighted I became when they (Theextraterrestrials) told me that God exists only on Earth.  How can you fully trust Men again, after they have called MaryMagdalene a whore and Eve a piece from Adam?  Learn the noble truth from unspoiled nature, and loyalty from yourpets.  The beings of lights told me that they reproduce through the minglingof lights. This is how they wed. And this is why they glow.  On Adelbaran, I will never age, and my mind will grow healthier andwiser. *** *** ***  I am not afraid to go to Adelbaran, Jamara (Name of a planet rotatingin their constellation) and Nimra (Another planet), for they (Extraterrestrials)told me that everything is going to be fine. Heike was concerned because wedon’t know their language and their habits. But they told me once we are there,they will re-construct our minds and bodies, and we will never suffer again orget sick. Their world is peaceful and beautiful. They will teach me many newthings and I will learn about the greatest secrets in the universe…I will haveaccess to their universal libraries which contains the Akashic records of theuniverse…. *** *** ***Chapter 7The United States and t he paranormal aspect of UFOs , and military interests ____________________ American p sychics were called in. During the early stage of the United States meetings with the aliens,(1947-1948) no less than 3 psychics were brought to the table. One of them was avery-well known medium, originally from Bombay –but naturalized American. Twomonths later he was dismissed.The psychics were not useful at all, and all their attempts to communicate withthe aliens failed. Maria Orsic explained to us that communication withextraterrestrials is possible only if they initiate contacts.The psychics were brought in because the military thought that this “Alienphenomenon” was of a paranormal nature.Of course, the military did not describe the aliens’ spacecraft as a paranormalthing, because they have already started to call upon scientists and engineersto find out how the spacecraft flew, and how the military can reverse thealiens’ technology.Nevertheless, the mere idea that these aliens and their crafts were not fromthis world pushed the military to explore all the possibilities, including thesupernatural and religious aspects of the phenomenon. By the end of 1949, the services of the psychics were permanently terminated bythe military. But in March of 1950, one psychic was recalled when a two stargeneral brought to the discussions table the files of the “Vril- Gesellschaft” . In 1959, v on Braun state d : “We find ourselves faced by powers which are farstronger than hitherto assumed, and whose base is at present unknown to us. MoreI cannot say at present. We are now engaged in entering into closer contact withthose powers, and within six or nine months time it may be possible to speakwith more precision on the matter.” *** *** ***[Image00132.jpg] Dr. von Braun Dr. von Braun admitted that Maria Orsic Vrill was successful. In fact, secretreports show that he tried to duplicate one of Maria’s small crafts (UFOs).Newspapers in Norway , Germany and Sweden published articles to that effect. ______________________________________ Joseph Banks Rhine : [Image00133.jpg] Dr. Joseph Banks Rhine with his wife,Dr. Louisa Rhine.________________________ The psychic s were joined by Dr. Joseph Banks Rhine, founder of theParapsychological Association. Dr. Rhine was known for his pioneeringparapsychology laboratory and research center at Duke University .Dr. Rhine spent approximately 180 hours on researching and assessing theparanormal aspect of the alien phenomenon.By July of 1950, all supernatural and paranormal studies of the aliens came to ahalt. And from that moment, no more psychics were asked to attend any meetingwith the aliens.However, ironically or coincidentally, during that time (1950-1951), a “branch”was created by an intelligence agency (Not the CIA) to carry on similar researchand experiments, and to develop programs related to the power of mind,auto-suggestion, “psychic espionage”, and similar topics.And to set the record straight, the “Branch” was not controlled by the CIA,NASA, DOD, DOE, USAF, the army and/or other macabre secret and vicious agencies,as it was falsely claimed by some ufologists and conspiracy theorists. As amatter of fact, the “Branch” was headed by a civilian psychiatrist, and entirelyoperated by civilian scientists, psychologists and physicians. The “Branch”reported directly to a committee created by The White House.And for several months, the findings of the Branch, and the reports of thePresidential Committee were kept secret.It was not until mid November of 1951 that the Branch’s studies, findings andreports were shared with other agencies and the military.But the reports, recommendations, memoranda and summaries of the PresidentialCommittee were known only to the President of the United States and two of hispersonal advisors/assistants; Dr. Vannevar Bush was one of them.

So everybody, Americans and Russians, British and Pol es , French and Italianshave heard rumors about Maria Ors ic, the German UFO s , and luckily for us, ourarmed forces in Germany, at the end of the Second World War, put their hands onGermany’s secret files on UFO, the RFZ 1 (Rundflugzeug 1) , the Horten 229, andseveral anti-gravity projects carried by Germany’s top scientists. This is documented in: a- United States naval intelligence files; b -OSS’s files ( P recursor to CIA ); c-British Secret Service (MI6) files; d-General Dwight Eisenhower Special Task Force reports, And other classified sources, I will not talk about. *** *** *** As soon as the Red Army captured Berlin , the Russians began looking for Germany’s top military scientists, and particularly those who worked on Maria’s Vril ,the V1, V2, and projects related to UFO.The Red Army captured 657 German scientists and shipped them to Moscow . A fewweeks later, they were sent to military bases and laboratories scattered inseveral Russian cities. My sources tell me that: a-15 German scientists died before they began to work on any projectrelated to UFO and similar programs; File:Mikoyan-Gurevich.jpg [Image00136.jpg]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Mikoyan-Gurevich.jpgFrom left to right: Mikhail Gurevich, Artem Mikoyan. __________________________  b-345 German scientists were immediately deployed in secretlocations;  c-32 German scientists were smuggled outside Russia (To Austria andSwitzerland ) by Allied forces secret agents and spies, and some ended in theUnited States and Great Britain ; d-100 German scientists became leading figures in the Russian spaceprograms, avionics, weapons systems, and instrumental in numerous space androckets programs under the leadership of eminent Russian scientists andengineers like :a- Artem Mikoyanb- Mikhail Gurevichc- Sputnik’s Sergei Korolevd- Sergey Aleksandrovich Afanasyeve- Mikhail Tikhonravov Worth mentioning here that:a- Prof. Robert Dopelb- Andrei Sakharovc- Igor KurchatovPlayed an instrumental role in the Russian early study and research of alienreverse engineering.  e-And the rest of them were unaccounted for.Nobody knows what happened to them. *** *** *** [Image00137.jpg] Andrei Sakharov and Igor Kurchatov. _________________________________[Image00138.jpg] From left to right: Mikhail Tikhonravov, Sergei Korolev,pausing in front of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. ______________________New Books by Maximillien de Lafayette Paperback editions are available at www.lulu.com [http://www.lulu.com]De Lafayette wrote more than 250 books on UFOs, extraterrestrials and aliens.Check the recently released titles at the author’s website:www.maximilliendelafayettebibliography.com[http://www.maximilliendelafayettebibliography.com] ACTIVATION OF THE CONDUIT AND THE SUPERSYMETRIC MIND.Beyond the Third Eye andToward the Oneness[http://www.amazon.com/ACTIVATION-CONDUIT-SUPERSYMETRIC-MIND-Beyond-ebook/dp/B004KSQWD2/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1297071850&sr=1-9] Transcripts of what the Aliens, Extraterrestrials andIntraterrestrials Told our Governments. Mind-Bending Black Operations, Weapons Systems and Experiments byExtraterrestrials, Grays and Governments. Learn how to speak the Anunnaki Language The Grays, Alien Abductions and Genetic Creation of Humans HybridsRace: Secret US Extraterrestrial Operations.

It contains hundreds of photographs,illustrations, maps, sketches and inscriptions, tablets and slabs translatedfrom Sumerian and Akkadian by the author, a world authority on ancient languagesand Anunnaki. 5,000 year old tablets demonstrated that WE ARE NOT CREATED BY THE GOD OF THEBIBLE. We were genetically created by the Anunnaki. This book has all the proofsto convince you once for good! The Anunnaki created the human race, God, Gods,angels, spirits and demons before the dawn of the history of Man. Don't beoffended, GOD was created by the Egyptian priests, and the Mesopotamianmyths/epics. And organized religions are cashing on it!The extraterrestrials created many species and different human races here onplanet Earth. But there are other early human beings who were created in space,and on other planets, and like the very small and very tall species, they werenot part of the evolutionary process of the modern human beings. In total, 36(some say 46) different human and quasi-human species lived on planet Earth inmany regions of the globe. And none of them were created by the \"God\" we knowand worship. After all, they did not look like humans, and if we have to believethat humans were created in the image of \"God\", as Judaism, Christianity andIslam tell us, then, most certainly those early 36 different species who lookedlike ferocious beasts, were not made in the image of \"God\".The Anunnaki, Igigi and other extraterrestrial civilizations created severalmodels of early human beings, Negative entities, reptilians, Djinns, Afrit,evil-birds, and demons which live in the lower sphere/zone (Alternatedimension), and on EarthAlso you will read about:Names of the Anunnaki gods and goddesses who created the first humans, and thegenetic creation of the human raceThe Igigi who created the first quasi human/robotsThe Akkadian text on the creation of ManAnunnaki geneticists who developed DNA sequences, and altered the genes ofhybridsThe early human formsThe Earth-made human creaturesThe Space-made human creaturesMetabolism and the oceans-made human creaturesEvolution of the extraterrestrials and the human racesNegative entities, reptilians, Djinns, Afrit, evil-birds, and demons which livein the lower sphere/zone (Alternate dimension), and on EarthAnamidra explains the creation of Man from cosmic clayCopies of the universe, including copies of ourselves, and Earth in otherdimensionsDual nature of humans, before they were separated genetically\"Grays\": Intraterrestrial non-humanHow the Anunnaki created us genetically in their laboratories.  *** *** ***[Image00141.jpg]15.Project Serpo, Zeta Reticuli, and Stargate16.

A WORLD PREMIERE EVENT.For the first time in philology’s history, and chronicles of civilizations ofthe ancient world, Maximillien de Lafayette, a world renowned expert linguist(Ancient Languages) provides us with the first lexicon/thesaurus/dictionary ofthe Anunnaki and Ulemite languages. This book is a treasure. It consists of aset of 4 volumes. The last volume focuses on Anunnaki and Igigi languageconversation. And YES you will be able to speak their terrestrial andextraterrestrials languages as spoken on Earth and their planet. This unique work consists of definitions of words, etymology, epistemology, thestudy and linguistic investigation of the derivation and origin of the ancientMiddle and Near East languages, Semitic and non-Semitic languages and dialects,including, but not limited to Old Babylonian, Akkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian,Chaldean, Aramaic, Phoenician, Ugaritic, Hebrew, Hittite, Arabic, etc.Ana’kh is the language of the Anunnaki who descended on ancient Turkey ,Mesopotamia , and Phoenicia according to the Ulema. It is of anextraterrestrial origin. Ulema Al Bakr stated that it was used by early thehuman beings who lived in ancient Anatolia , on the Island of Arwad , in Tyre ,Sidon , Byblos , Ugarit , Amrit, and Mu. He added that from the Ana’kh derivedthe primitive languages of the Near East and the Middle East . Ana’kh was nevermade public.It remained a secret language known only to the Ulema, and later on to theAllamah. It sounds Semitic, because of its phonetics. But it is “not Semitic atall”, said Ulema Ghandar Gupta.It has no grammar, but it has an extremely rich vocabulary and an abundance ofmetaphoric expressions.A considerable number of Akkadian and Sumerian words that appeared in theSumerian/Akkadian/Chaldean Epic of Creation and the Bible derived from Ana’kh.Around 569 A.D., a group of Ulema (Munawareen) in the Near East (Non-Islamicscholars) compiled an extensive list of Ana’kh words and phrases. In 625, A.D.,two leading figures of the Ulema brotherhood wrote the Book of Rama-Dosh; acompilation of Ana’kh terminology, a lexicon, and Kiraats ( Readings ).Ulema AL Bakr stated that the Ulema are not member of a religious group. Theyare neither Muslim nor members of any organized religion. In fact, they werepersecuted by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, and were expelled from theArab Peninsula . They found refuge in Cyprus and Marseille. But the honorableUlema was quick to point out that the early Sufi masters, poets and Sufi trancedancers were Ulema. He added that Ulema should not be confused with the IslamicUlema who teach Islamic law, or with the Allamah who were the leading Islamicfigures of science and letters in medieval times.Farid Tayarah, an Ulema himself, and a former head of a Masonic Lodge statedthat the Ana’kh was used during Masonic sessions and services. He added that aconsiderable number of Masonic words and expressions are pure Ana’kh, especiallythose words referring to levels and degrees in Freemasonry, and initiationceremonies.Many of the original words of this language, as well as numerous linguisticderivations are included in this book.
