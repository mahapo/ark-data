But you have to keep in mind, that no one, nobody on Earth can summon the spirit or the soul of a dead person. “Maat...Maat L’il Abd”, meaning “Once dead, is dead for good and for ever...” said word for word, by the Honorable Allamah Saleh Sharif Al Kuraychi Al Ansari."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" 36 Introduction (Cont’d) ____________________________________________ He meant that, we, the human beings who are still alive CANNOT contact the dead, and we will never be able to do so, because humans live in a physical zone, while the dead live in another zone, far beyond our reach. In other words, dead people are unreachable, once they cross the bridge of life, and enter another dimension that follows our third dimension, once the 40 day period following their death has expired. So, all those who claim to be able to communicate with the dead are fooling us. However, the Allamah, and some of you, who have assimilated the messages and techniques of the Allamah --which are explained in this book in utmost simplicity-- will be able to reach spirits and entities who did not yet depart from the doomed zone. They are still alive, but they do exist in a different form. And these entities include the spirits of dead people (Human beings) who are still trapped in the doomed zone. Some of them have stayed in this macabre and disturbing zone for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Other entities were never dead; they were created from formulae and genetic experiments, our mind will never understand or accept. Yet, they do exist. You will be able to communicate with some of these entities, summon them, ask them favors, and even command them. But who are these entities, if they are not the souls of the departed ones, the souls of dear friends, siblings, parents, and relatives, we once had, here, on Earth? These entities are divided into two groups or classes: 1-Class one, called Moo-Aa-Zabeen: Can we communicate with them? Yes, we can."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" 37 Introduction (Cont’d) ____________________________________________ Moo-Aa-Zabeen live in Marach-mawta (The doomed zone). Moo-Aa-Zabeen means those who are suffering. It derived from the Ulemite word “Azaab”, which means pain, suffering. Azaab exists in the Arabic language, and means the very same thing. The Moo-Aa-Zabeen suffer because their souls, or spirits (Anunnaki-Ulema use the word Mind) are trapped in the doomed zone, and can’t get out. The Sahiriin do not considered them as “Fully Dead”. Thus, we can communicate and summon some of them, using techniques and summons provided in volume one and volume two. Moo-Aa-Zabeen were once humans. Do not confuse “Noufous” with Moo-Aa-Zabeen. Noufous is the plural of “Nafs”, which means “Soul” of dead people. Nafs or Nafsiya in Arabic. Nefesh in Hebrew. Those Noufous do not live in the doomed zone, but in the world beyond, the realm of souls (Human souls). We cannot communicate with the Noufous, and therefore, we cannot summon them. *** *** *** 2-Class two, called Haadeeraat, and sometimes, Arwaah: Can we communicate with them? Yes, we can. Haadeeraat, and Arwaah live here on Earth, as well as in multiple layers of non-physical dimensions, incomprehensible to many of us. Haadeeraat means “Presences”; presences of all sorts, kinds and forms of apparitions and manifestations, such as: ∑ Ezraelim ∑ Gaffarim ∑ Djinns (Jinns. Always in the plural form) ∑ Afarit (Plural of Afrit)"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" 38 Introduction (Cont’d) ____________________________________________ ∑ Ashbah (Plural of Shabah) ∑ Apkallu ∑ Gallas ∑ Angels ∑ Demons ∑ Ghoolim ∑ Helama-Gooliim Arwaah is the plural of “Rouh”, which means spirit or soul. Rouh in Arabic and Roach in Hebrew. Arwaah encompasses all kinds and categories of souls and spirits we can summon. But basically, the word Arwaah refers to the souls of angels, demons and afarit. *** *** *** Language of the Arwaah (Spirits) How do we talk to entities, spirits, souls, presences, etc.? They have their own language (s), and some share the same language. For reasons we do not understand, the language of the Arwaah contains many Hebrew, Kabalistic, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Arabic, Hittite, Turkish, Sumerian, Persian, Akkadian, Chaldean, and Assyrian words. Allamah Seif El Diin said the Arwaah words found in these ancient languages, were originally and primordially taken from the Rihaniyaat, and Ana’kh, the language of the Anunnaki and Igigi. Volume one and volume two contain a sufficient number of Arwaah phrases, words, and commands which will help you to summon and command the Arwaah. Some entities and spirits will only respond to particular commands, and very precise words and Talabaat.

Therefore, I urgently advise you to read (And to learn) the Glossary/Terminology before you start reading any part of this book. *** *** *** Is there eternal life after death? Absolutely! But this after-death sort of life is incomprehensible to many of us. I have written on this subject, and describe life after death, and different dimensions of life after death, the realm of spirits and Arwaah, and the world beyond, in my books on the Anunnaki and Anunnaki-Ulema. I am not going to repeat myself in this book. I advise you, if you are still interested in these subjects, to read my previous books. I took the liberty of listing some of the most useful and informative books on this topic, at the end of this tome. *** *** *** Can we befriend Arwaah and spirits? Absolutely! The Sahiriin have provided us with a list of friendly Arwaah and spirits. They called them: ∑ a-Moustajabiin (Those who respond) ∑ b-Al Muhibiin (The affectionate ones)"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" 40 Introduction (Cont’d) ____________________________________________ Their names are listed in volume one of this series. And I have included phrases and commands you must use to summon them. In this volume, I have added more phrases and commands needed for very special summoning séances, and for asking what the Sahiriin call Ahamiya Istajabaat, meaning “Big Favors”. However, you have to keep in mind, that many Arwaah are playful and tricky. They love to play tricks on you, and disorient you. This happens for many reasons, as I have explained in my prior work. In some instances, some of these friendly Arwaah and spirits can turn on you, and possibly hurt you, if you disrespect them, and/or infuriate them by insisting on obtaining favors that they have ignored in the past. The Arwaah and spirits have their own reasons for not responding to this or that Talabaat, and you must respect this. If you don’t, you could be hurt. Don’t ever think that you have full authority and absolute power over them. You don’t! Keep the Arwaah happy. If you do, you will befriend them for ever. And some, will stay with you for the rest of your life, to help you, to guide you, and to grant you endless favors. ∑ Does this mean that the spirits would help you pay your rent if you are in financial difficulty, and find you a job if you are unemployed? ∑ Does this mean, the spirits will come to rescue you, if you are in an imminent danger or desperately helpless?? ∑ Can the spirits help a soccer team win the World Cup? According to the Sahiriin, they would and could!! So what we have to do to gain their full support? You will find the answers, pertinent techniques, and most secret commands in both volumes in this series. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":" 41 Introduction (Cont’d) ____________________________________________ Any hostile and dangerous Arwaah and spirits out there? You bet! Plenty! And they are called Shirririin. The Shirririin are divided into four categories: ∑ a-Kaabihiin: It is derived from the word “Kaabeeh”, which means bad, bad deed, awful action and awful thoughts. Thus, Kaabihiin become the bad spirits. ∑ b-Sharrariin: They are the worst. Derived from the word “Sharr”, which means evil or from the devil. Thus, Sharrariin become the evil spirits. ∑ c-Aatiliin: They are the “Devious Spirits”, who respond only to black magic, and are usually summoned to hurt others. ∑ d-Fasidiin: Literarily translated, the word Fasidiin means “The “Rotten Spirits” who respond to summons intended to disrupt the lives of other people, and bring them all sorts of catastrophes, including diseases, illness, and death. Note: Turkey and the Arab Peninsula Afarit are extremely disturbing. For some reasons not fully explained by the Allamah, these Afarit find a great satisfaction in annoying Turkish women. It looks silly to people in the Western Hemisphere, but ask those women who have felt their presence, and how they have disrupted their lives for years, and you will hear an avalanche of incredible stories and testimonies. No! These women are not lunatics.

The Sahiriin Shir techniques were never recorded, and written down in a systematic manner. The techniques were never compiled and classified as a manual, but rather as Dirasaat and Kiraat. They were shrouded in secrecy for centuries, for almost 1,600 years, and were transmitted from Allamah to adepts and students. Thus, this book becomes the world’s first work of its kind. All the techniques, instructions, Talabaat, commands, and séances summoning protocol (s) as provided and described in this book are in conformity with the Kiraat and Dirasaat of the Sahiriin, and especially their secret Ahaadeeth.

Extremely effective, if you follow the instructions of the Sahiriin. Use it for the benefit and welfare of your fellow human beings. Use it only for good purposes, and purify your intentions, thoughts and feelings before you summon any entity. Hurting people does not pay. Be merciful, generous and forgiving. Hate and vengeance are self-destructive. You might enjoy some success and satisfaction in hurting others, but sooner or later, your hate will destroy you. Nothing in the world is prettier and more noble than helping others unconditionally, especially those who cannot return the favor.

Your first reading should be done when you are alone. You should not be distracted by others. There are lots of words and expressions you are not familiar with.

The esoteric Arabic word “Firasa” is derived from Fik.Ra.Sa. It means in Arabic the ability to read thoughts, to understand the psyche of a person just by looking at him/her. The Ulema uses Fik’r to read the mind, to learn about the intentions of others, and assess the level of intelligence of people. This can be done through seeing the information/data stored on the two lines of the persons Khateyn Tarika. According to the doctrine and Kira’at of the Ulema, the soul is an invention of early humans, who needed to believe in a next life. It was through the soul that mortals could and would hope to continue to live after death. Soul as an element or a substance does not exist anywhere inside the human body. Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes the brain function, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul. The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the time they created the final form of the human race. Fik’r was not used in the early seven prototypes of the creation of mankind according to the Sumerian texts. Although The “Fik’r”, is the primordial source of life for our physical body, it is not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is the physical description of our genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers and sequences of what there in our body, the data and history of our genes, genetic origin, ethnicity, race, so on. Thus Fik’r includes DNA. Ulema said: “Consider Fik’r as a cosmic-sub-atomic-intellectual- extraterrestrial (Meaning non-physical, non-earthly) depot of all what it constituted, constitutes and shall continue to constitute everything about you. And it is infinitesimally small. However, it can expand to an unimaginable dimension, size and proportions. It stays alive and continues to grow after we pass away, if it is still linked to the origin of its creation, in our case the Anunnaki. The Fik’r is linked to our creators the Anunnaki through a “Conduit” found in the cells of the brain."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" 81 Chapter 1: Glossary/Terminology ____________________________________________ For now, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble. After death, this bubble leaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as the bubble leaves the body. The body dies because the bubble leaves the body. Immediately, with one tenth of one million of a second, the molecule or the bubble frees itself from any and everything physical, including the atmosphere, the air, and the light; absolutely everything we can measure, and everything related to earth, including its orbit. The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to stand judgment and await the decision of God -whether you have to go to heaven or hell– because there is no hell and there is no heaven the way we understand hell and heaven. So it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist or a believer in any other religion. The molecule (Bubble) enters the original blueprint of “YOU”; meaning the first copy, the first sketch, the first formula that created you. Humans came from a blueprint. Every human being has a Double. Your double is a copy stored in the “Rouh-Plasma”. The Rouh-Plasma is an enormous compartment under the control of the Anunnaki on Nibiru and can be transported to another star, if Nibiru ceases to exist. And this double is immortal. In this context, the human being is also immortal, because its Double never dies. Once the molecule re-enters your original copy (Which is the original You), you come back to life with all your faculties, including your memory, but without physical, emotional and sensorial properties (The properties you had on earth), because they are not perfect.” Ulema Sadiq said: “At that time, and only at that time, will you decide whether you want to stay in your Double or go somewhere else...the universe is yours."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 82 Chapter 1: Glossary/Terminology ____________________________________________ If your past life on earth accumulated enough good deeds such as charity, generosity, compassion, forgiveness, goodness, mercy, love for animals, respect for nature, gratitude, fairness, honesty, loyalty...then your Double will have all the wonderful opportunities and reasons to decide and select what shape, format, condition you will be in, and where you will continue to live.” In other words, you will have everything, absolutely everything and you can have any shape you want including a brand new corporal form. You will be able to visit the whole universe and live for ever, as a mind, as an indestructible presence, and also as a non-physical, non- earthly body, but you can still re-manifest yourself in any physical body you wish to choose. Worth mentioning here, that the molecule, (So-called soul in terrestrial term) enters a new dimension by shooting itself into space and passing through the “Ba’ab”, a sort of a celestial star- gate or entrance. If misguided, your molecule (your so-called soul) will be lost for ever in the infinity of time and space and what there is between., until reconnected to your prototype via the “Miraya”. ∑ Gabri-ill-ummu: Holy angel Gabriel.

Ayn means eye, Fasidah means deteriorated, bad, devilish, evil. Therefore, the whole meaning is the evil eye. And what does evil eye mean? It refers to people who are very jealous of you, and who wish you harm because they are envious of you, of your looks, of your success, of your status, of your wealth, etc., so their envy, jealousy and even hatred are “stored” in their eyes, and their eyes can project negative vibes in your direction, capable of causing you severe damages, and in some instances, even death."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" 112 Chapter 2: Ayn Fasidah.

Ayn Zarka (Blue Eye) is an amulet depicting a blue eye engraved on a piece of jade, ivory, stone, bones, wood, or similar object. It serves as a deterrent, a sort of protection against envy and jealousy. In other words, it is similar to the Ayn Fasidah magical square, but does not contain the spell and magical effect of the Sahiriin and Allamah.

Never hate those who hate you, if you want to win. Hate is self destructive. There are many ways for dealing with people who hate your guts. The best way is to protect yourself in a peaceful manner. As you already know, hate disorients people’s judgment, and consequently, reasoning with them becomes useless. The Sahiriin use various Kitabaat, spells, and Arwaah séances to cripple their enemies. The Rouhaniyiin use magical writings. And this is exactly what we are going to do. What is Kitbah Kirha? Kitbah Kirha is a magical writing to block or neutralize the effects and results of hattred, that people have expressed towards you.

Instead of spending time, effort and energy to counter their malicious acts, you should continue to produce, to create, and to carry on with your business and projects as usual. But at the same time, and while you are ignoring their campaign of hate, you should immediately block the results of hate’s vibes by strengthening your state of mind, and especially by creating a wall between their hate and its implications on your being and your business. This wall, explained Allamah Saleh bin Ani Zubian could be “elevated by using the Kitbah Kirha.” How to use it. Follow these instructions: 1. First of all, compile a list of people you think hate you. Document this, and make sure that you can substantiate your beliefs. Be objective and remain calm. 2.

Introduction: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is one of the most powerful magical writings known to Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. Allamah Bin Thabet Al Ansari said, “It is a double edged sword, because the Taaleb can use it for both good and evil. It is powerful and dangerous placed in the wrong hands. It is a blessing in the hands of the righteous ones.”"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" 148 Chapter 4: Magical writings & summoning spirits. Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra ________________________________________________ Well, what he meant is this: Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a very effective magical tool to summon and command bad spirits and good spirits. If used with good intentions, the Taaleb’s requests will be answered by good spirits and entities, and guardian angels. They will manifest in the flesh, and grant lots of favors. Now, if the Taaleb summons bad spirits and entities like Ghoolim and Afrit, these malevolent spirits will also manifest in the flesh, and of course will grant the Taaleb many favors, but there is a high price to pay for this. First, “the bad spirits could steal a part of your Nefs, and control it for a very long time. This happens when the Taaleb is a beginner. The Sahiriin masters can control and fully command the bad spirits without risk. But could you?” said the Honorable master Suleiman Tarek bin Ziyad. He added, “Secondly, once your Talaabat are granted, you create an alliance with the Fasidiin and the lower level of Arwaah. This means, that the bad Arwaah will also be entitled to ask you favors in return, such as entering the bodies of other people, usually innocent people and frightened souls (Human souls).” II. What is Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra? Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra is a magical circle that contains the names of angels and malevolent spirits, the Taaleb can summon and communicate with. It is frequently used by the Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin for multiple purposes, including but not limited to: a. Asking favors from the angels, all sorts of favors, big and small. b. Removing obstacles that halt or prevent success in business, and relationships. "},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":" 149 Chapter 4: Magical writings & summoning spirits.

Communicating with spirits trapped in the doomed zone. e. Guiding the trapped souls of dead people who cannot get out of the doomed zone. f. Cleansing areas and spots that are causing sickness, diseases and bad luck. The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin believe that there are spots and regions on Earth considered to be unhealthy and unlucky spots. People who live in those areas will never succeed in life, and their health could be seriously damaged. They also believe that on Earth, there are areas that bring good health and good luck to people. g. And so on. III. Names of angels mentioned in Daa-irat Al Shams Al Koubra: ∑ a. Jarmihyabeel ∑ b.

If these letters are written in proper sequence, the Taaleb could receive endless favors from the angels and spirits. However, the Taaleb should never pronounce these letters. These letters are to be written down inside the circle, and never pronounced."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":" 150 Chapter 4: Magical writings & summoning spirits.

Usually, the spirits appear in the flesh. But in some instances, they don’t. Instead, they manifest themselves by moving objects around you. This is an indication of their presence. 10. If you are familiar with the “Triangular Paper”, make use of it. This is an excellent way of communicating with the spirits. I have explained this in my book “How to Summon and Command Spirits, Angels, Demons, Afarit, Djinns” Vol 1 on pages 66, 67, 68. Triangular Paper technique: Note: In some summoning séances, you need a stack of papers to communicate with entities and spirits. I am taking the liberty of including here a synopsis of the “Triangular Paper” technique, taken from the aforesaid book: In some séances, you might need to use papers as Majda. For some reason, sometimes, the entity refuses to talk to you. But you still have another option to make it/her/him converse with you. How to use it. Follow these instructions: ∑ a. Fold a piece of paper in the shape of a triangle and place it on the ground (Burqua’h, sand, working zone). No particular place is required. You can even place the triangular paper outside the Burqua’h. It does not matter, really. But keep the paper far from the candle. Avoid fire accidents.

Tasiir means to influence others in the Sahiriin’s language. Literarily, it means to impress. It is represented by the magical circle of Tasiir Daa-irat moutaba’aa. Daa-iraat means circles within circles or circumferences within circumferences, referring to the “multiple layers and zones of the mind”, as explained by Allamah Behrooz Khorshiid (Khorsad). Moutaba’aa means continued. Literarily, it means followed by. It refers to the “constant changing of people’s decisions and courses of action,” as explained by Allamah Al Nabati. Tasiir appeared in both the Arabic and Persian Rouhaniyaat, but was interpreted differently for unknown reasons. It is usually used in spirits and entities summoning séances."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":" 164 Chapter 4: Magical writings & summoning spirits. Tasiir ________________________________________________ Both black magic and white magic made use of the Tasiir Daa- irat moutaba’aa to influence people, and make them do whatever the Saher wishes or requests. It is a very effective magical tool with a double edge. Allamah Al Nabati said verbatim, “It could be used for good or for evil. Everything depends on the intentions and Talabaat of the Taaleb. And everything also depends on who has been summoned. Are they Angels? Demons? Afrit? Or souls trapped in the doomed zone?” In the old days, it was used by the Sahiriin in Baghdad, Mosul, Damascus, and many parts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to influence judges and rulers. Many have claimed they were set free and/or acquitted, because a Saher opened up for them the magical circle of Tasiir. This technique was banned/condemned by Prophet Mohammad, and later on by his companions. And Fatwahs were issued against all seers and magicians who have practiced Tasiir. How to use it. Follow these instructions: 1. First prepare your Burqua’h, and then cut out page 165 to use it in your séance. 2. Create a black box in the middle or the center of the magical circle. See page 167. 3. Write down the full name of the person you want to influence or impress. 4. You must write his or her name backward, from right to left, otherwise it will not work.

Introduction: Khateyn Tarika is one of the most important, mind-bending and powerful parts of Ilmu (Knowledge and wisdom), and the secret doctrine of the Allamah and Rouhaniyiin. If you unlock its secrets, you will reach your full potential, and accomplish the impossible. Khateyn Tarika will put you on the right track, leading to spectacular success, power, harmony with your environment, and perfect health. The Honorable Master Khafaja Sudki Ghayali said verbatim: “If you are “Outside Khateyn Tarika”, you will never reach the top, in anything you do, no matter how happy, intelligent, influential, and rich you are.” The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin told us that every human being on Earth is lined up with two invisible lines that determine her/his balance and harmony with their immediate surroundings, as well as the size and strength of his/her luck in this physical world. Ironically, people sometimes say: “You are out of line” without knowing the real and original meaning of this phrase! Where did this expression come from? And what do they mean by “Out of”? And what “Line” are they talking about? They don’t know. It is just a very common and popular expression that applies to some situations, and debates/discussions we are familiar with. The expression “Out of line” appeared for the first time as a “Magical metaphysical” Jimlah in the book “Ilmu Al Donia”, written centuries ago in Arabic and Persian. The first to use this expression were the Anunnaki-Ulema. "},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":" 183 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ II. What is Khateyn Tarika? Pronounced: Kha (Like J in Jose in Spanish) Tayn Taa-Ree-Ka. Khateyn means: Two Lines. It is the plural of Khat, which means one line. They are invisible to the naked eye. The Rouhaniyiin nicknamed Khateyn “Tarik al Hayat”, meaning the road of life. These two lines determine how healthy, successful and balanced you are or will be in your life, in this physical dimension. More information on this topic will follow. Tarika means a path, a road. It is usually linked to your present and future, with major impact on your health, business, spirituality, physical strength, successes, and relationships. Khateyn Tarika is a very complex and sophisticated concept, difficult to understand or to accept, unless you are one of the “Illuminated Masters”, or the initiated ones (Students and adepts). But I will try to explain this concept as much as I can, in very simple language. Before I do that, I want to let you know that Khateyn Tarika is directly linked to your “Double”, astral body, your mind, your “Fik’r”, spirits and entities who live here on Earth, and in other dimensions. III. Explaining the concept: a- Position and place of the two lines: All of us, big and small, lucky and unlucky, rich and poor, famous, infamous and unknown, are conditioned and influenced by two invisible etheric lines that exist either ahead of our body, behind it, or around it. And the position and placement of these two lines that we cannot see –unless we were taught how to find them– have a major impact on everything we do, and think about."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":" 184 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ b- The perfect alignment: If the two lines are aligned perfectly in parallel position to your body, your brain, or more precisely your intellect will produce magnificent deeds, and you will be able to accomplish things, people thought impossible. Not only that, but you will acquire astonishing speed that allows you to complete tasks, usually requiring much more time and effort. And in some instances, you will be capable of accomplishing multiple tasks, simultaneously, and in certain conditions, INSTANTLY! c- The mixed-up alignment: If the two lines are mixed up –meaning not aligned as two parallel lines on the right side and left side of your body, and/or situated behind you, or way ahead of you– your potentials will be limited, and your accomplishments will be minimal. Consequently, you will not flourish. Many people live, exist, and do things outside the lines. They work hard, long hours, they sweat, and yet, their efforts remain in vain. This failure is caused by the misalignment of the two lines. But there is a way to rectify the situation. In this section of the book, I will explain to you how to do it, and how to maintain a perfect alignment, both mentally and physically. d- The weak and blurry alignment: If the two lines are barely defined, your health will deteriorate rapidly, and your finances will crumble. You will fail miserably in your relationships and rapports with others, and all your resources will dry up. *** *** *** "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":" 185 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ IV. Inside the two lines: Inside the two lines is the perfect place to be. This is the zone of very successful and healthy people. This zone is harmonious with your environment, and the multiple layers of everything that surrounds you. It is a magical and incomprehensible zone, full of surprises and possibilities. It is the zone of subatomic particles, the extension of your “Conduit”, the realm of your “Double”, and above all your true mental and bio-organic identity. It is also the zone of visions, apparitions, alternate realities, fantasy, meta-reality, metalogic, and your rendez-vous with entities and “presences”. The illuminated masters live and do things “between the lines.” They are never outside of the lines, or “out-of-line”. I hear you now telling yourself, “It is so confusing, all these words, dimensions, and bla-bla-bla words are Chinese to me...mumbo jumbo stuff...etc.” But that is not it. It is simply a new concept you are not yet familiar with. If you are patient, and if you give me the time to explain it to you, you will understand to a certain degree what I am talking about! Here we go: V. You, your body, the bodies of others, entities and spirits, and Khateyn Tarika: For now, we are going to call Khateyn Tarika “The Zone”. To make you understand this concept, and to render your zone healthy and well-balanced, I have to explain to you 5 important factors, and which are: ∑ Vis-à-vis your physical body’s zone. ∑ People entering your zone. ∑ Entities and spirits entering your zone. ∑ Entering other people’s zone."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":" 186 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ ∑ Adjusting your zone, meaning bringing equilibrium and awareness to your zone. *** *** *** a. Vis-à-vis your physical body’s zone: Your body has two spaces. One, is the physical space that it occupies. Usually defined and limited by your height, size and weight. The other, is a space you don’t see. It is an extension of your physical body. This extension does exist, even though you are not aware of it. So, where is it? It starts from a quarter of a centimeter from your physical body and extends up to 5 feet, in some cases up to 6 feet, in front of your body, and encompasses a distance of 4 feet on both sides of your body (Left and right), and a distance of 4 feet behind your body. So we have here, 6 feet in front, 4 feet in the rear, and 4 feet to the left and right. This is your zone. This zone stays with you for the rest of your life. In this zone, you find your “Double”, your astral body, your “Space memory”, your aura, and your physical-non-physical emotions. Does it increase or decrease? Yes! It does! And everything depends on the place and position your body occupies between Khateyn Tarika (The two lines). You should keep your body well-aligned within these two lines. This means, that the two lines should always remain parallel to each other, straight as an arrow, and your body should be situated at an equal distance from each line, on the left and on the right. *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":" 187 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ What causes the zone to shrink or extend? Shrinking or extending your zone is not healthy, mentally and physically. Evil thoughts, fear, envy, jealousy, hate, suspicions, greed, bad hygiene, worries about finances, trauma caused by losing a job, health problems, addiction to drugs, alcohol and similar substances jeopardize the stability of the two lines, disorient your body, and consequently push the two lines far away from your body. When these two lines are at a distance exceeding 6 feet ahead of you, they will instantly lose their parallel alignment. And when this happens, your body is no longer protected. Yes! The two lines are your shield. Once, they are no longer close to your body, all sorts of things will invade your zone. In other words, you have lost your mental-etheric-metaphysical immune system. This loss will automatically affect your brain, your “Conduit”, you creativity, and above all your judgment! The two lines are your invisible non-physical guardians. Once you lose your guardians, your non-physical body, which is a copy of your physical body, becomes a “Vagabond”, as stated by Allamah Mouhtaram Kemal Agha. He meant, that your body is on its own, and no longer guided by your brain. Your unprotected body will do ridiculous things, and in some situations, will expose you to imminent danger. For instance, your unprotected body will wake you up in the middle of the night, and make you walk in your sleep, in an erratic manner, and do things a rational person would not do. The problem with this situation, is the fact that you remain totally unaware of what is happening. In these situations you can hurt yourself. It is during this very stage, unwanted “presences” and entities will interfere to misguide you, to disorient you, and influence your subconscious mind, decisions, and actions. "},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":" 188 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ According to the Allamah and Rouhaniyiin, if these occurrences are frequent, your mind will fall prey to illusions and visions created by the entities. Some have called these mishaps, “Possessed by the evil spirits”, others have described these unpleasant incidents as “Being totally commanded by a sick and unbalanced Double.” Allamah Moukhar Al Ansari said verbatim, “In some cases, the Double of other people manifests itself to add more confusion to your mind, and distract your body.” Personally, I have witnessed similar events. A friend of mine who slept overnight at my home, woke up around 2:00 in the morning, started to walk in his sleep all over the place, went to the library bookcase, and began to arrange books on the shelves, threw some on the floor, and ended up rolling one bottle of wine across the floor to the kitchen. He grabbed a bottle, emptied it in a matter of minutes, and hid it under the kitchen sink. A few seconds later, he started to scream and bounce in all directions. And then I heard him saying: “Go away...stay away from me. You hurt me enough! I am no longer a child!” Apparently, he was talking to the Double of his mother who manifested it’s presence as a holographic projection, in the form of a wicked woman dancing like an African witch outside his own Khateyn Tarika. This event happened twice before my own eyes. The very next day, my friend accused me of drinking the whole bottle of wine and hiding it under the kitchen sink!! Then, when I told him about the wicked woman who invaded his zone while he was sleep walking, he said: “Who was it? Was it my mother?” According to the Sahiriin, my friend was lucky, because at that critical moment, no malevolent spirits invaded his Khateyn Tarika. "},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":" 189 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Possessed by the spirits : As long as you keep your two lines in harmony, and not far from your body, and as long as you maintain an anchored and well- balanced position of your body between the two lines, no spirit will ever invade your zone. And no entity will ever haunt you and/or manipulate your mind. According to Kitab Al Arwaah (The Book of Spirits), spirits, malevolent entities and unwanted Arwaah will never enter the bodies of human beings who have well-aligned Khateyn Tarika. It is only when they are out-of-line, that possession by entities becomes possible. When the two lines deviate, evil spirits invade your zone and take possession of your body and mental faculties. Many have killed while sleep-walking, and never realized what they have done. Psychiatrists and psychologists came up with all sorts of explanations, and suggested an avalanche of therapies and treatments, but unfortunately, as mental health records show, they remained in vain, and their elaborate explanations were never convincing. Some court records and transcripts tell of people who have committed crimes while sleep-walking, who were acquitted, because they were found temporarily insane, and thus not legally responsible for their actions. The Allamah see the situation quite differently. They contribute these frightening events to the “displacement” of Khateyn Tarika, which of course is ridiculed by scientists in the West, and the clergy. Yet, men of the cloth, publicly admit that evil spirits and the Devil could easily enter the human body, and possess all our faculties. And how do they deal with this situation? Exorcism. The Rouhaniyiin and Sahiriin think otherwise. In their opinion, only the re-alignment of Khateyn Tarika, will solve the problem, and expunge any malevolent exterior (External) intervention and possession."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" 190 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Khateyn Tarika and Levitation : Levitation: Not a sign of sainthood! Another disturbing aspect of the unbalanced Khateyn Tarika, is levitation. According to the Catholic Church, levitation is a sign of sainthood. The Sahiriin do not agree. According to Kitab Al Arwaah, levitation during sleep-walking is strong evidence that the person is under the direct influence and control of entities. My friend who was walking in his sleep in my house is NO saint by all means, I can assure that! Yet, he was floating in the air and hovering over my furniture and nearby the top of my bookcase. HE IS NO SAINT!! Simply, he was out-of-control, and “Out-of- line”. The Khateyn Tarika lines, that is. *** *** *** What should you do when you see your friend floating in the air in your house? Keep your eye on him. Do NOT touch him! Move sharp objects out of his path. Give him space. Keep a reasonable distance from him. And don’t try to converse with him, or ask him to land! It is worthless and useless, simply because he can’t hear you. He is on a different plane, in a different zone, far very far from where you are, even though a few feet separate you from him. He is in a state or a zone, some might amusingly call the twilight zone. In plain English, should we let him stay suspended in the air, or do something about it? And how about if he heads toward the windows or your balcony? Will you let him jump and dive? He would not jump, and he would not dive if you do not interfere or physically try to bring him down."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":" 191 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Even though his eyes are closed (Usually), and he seems under the influence and guidance of a force or something you know nothing about, your friend is safe, unless he begins to spin like a carousel, shout, scream, or laugh in a very bizarre manner. In this case, follow these instructions (According to the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin), at your own risk. I am not responsible for your actions and decisions, should you decide to follow these instructions. As reported by adepts and seers, these instructions have proved to be useful. This is their opinion, and not necessarily mine. Their opinion is based upon their belief that any person who acts in this manner is in fact, under the strong control and manipulation of unpleasant forces and disturbing entities. Here they are: ∑ Throw a blanket or a towel on floor, right below his feet. ∑ Don’t say a word to him. Instead pronounce this and keep on repeating this phrase, until the levitation stops: Bisma Nour Rabbani wa kuwat al malaakout, inzal inzal, idbaroo ya fasidiin khalaakiyaat. Translation word for word: Bisma: By the name of. Nou r : Light. Rabbani: Godly. Divine. Wa: And. With. Kuwat: The power. The authority. Al: The. Malaakout: Kingdom. inzal inzal: Come down come down.

Fasidiin: Rotten. Bad. Khalaakiyaat: Creatures. General meaning: By the name of the godly light and the power of the kingdom of God, I order you to come down, and you bad spirits I order you to go away. And what if the suspended friend is an atheist? How will the divine command convince him to land on your blanket, since he does not believe in God? Well, even though the command contains words like godly, divine, kingdom, and so on, the words by themselves have no effect whatsoever on your flying-by-night friend. The Sahiriin said, the command will be heard by the entities, and this should be enough to force them to comply with your request. And then what? Your friend will land on your blanket, and shortly thereafter will return to where he came from, unaware of anything. Is it the end of the adventure? No! You should ask a Master to re-align his Khateyn Tarika, or learn how to do it yourself! Where and how could I learn the technique of the re-alignment of Khateyn Tarika? You might ask. Answer: I have explained the technique of the re-alignment of Khateyn Tarika in one of the booklets of “Anunnaki-Ulema Ramadosh Techniqes of How to Acquire Supernatural Powers.” One of my students asked me a very intelligent question (Which contained many sub-questions) in regard to the command “Bisma Nour Rabbani...”"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":" 193 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Here is his question: “I did not summon any entity or open any séance, so first, how do I know there is an entity in the room, second, where did this entity come from? And third, why did we have to learn all these complicated summoning techniques, and spend hours and hours learning and practicing how to open a séance, if an entity could pop out, any time, unannounced, just like that, out of the blue? My answer: According to the protocol of the Arwaah, in normal conditions, no entity or spirit will ever appear before your eyes if you do not know to open a séance and summon the spirits. This is the rule of thumb. However, there are very rare situations, when an entity manifests itself, unannounced and un-summoned. This happens, when another person has been followed or harassed by an entity. This person brings with him or her, not only the entity in question, but also several other entities and spirits if they were in the company of the principal entity. Those who have studied Sihr, or at least got acquainted with some of the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin techniques and Kira’at, will instantly feel the presence of an entity or spirit. If they are beginners, they will have a hard time dealing with the entity, and probably would not know what to do. Those who have practiced Sihr, and/or learned Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin advanced techniques would know immediately what to do in these situations, and how to command the entity. Even though there are specific commands, and Talabaat for specific situations and conditions, there are also two or three standard commands that apply to situations when an entity manifests itself on its own. I have explained these in my book “How to Summon and Command Spirits, Angels, Demons, Afarit, Djinns.”"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":" 194 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Is this typical spirits possession of the human body? Yes it is, according to the Rouhaniyiin and Sahiriin. And it is called “Intisakhah” Some Intisakhah are temporary, others could last for a very long period of time. Some occur during a séance, others while the Khateyn Tarika are unbalanced, and distant from the human body. New age ufology called these entities who enter the human bodies, “walk-ins.” Anunnaki-Ulema Rabbi Mordachai ben Zvi told me that our third dimension (Earth) is surrounded by time-space pockets that open and close at some particular moments. During these phases, entities of all sorts, living-forms, particles, sub-atomic particles, “time bubbles” as well as gravity from parallel dimensions could enter our world, and take on different shapes and forms. Afrit and Arwaah are no exception. In fact, what we have witnessed in the case of our “flying- hovering friend” is one of those moments, when an entity enters our dimension without a formal request. The entity starts to look for people whose “Double” is suffering from lack of harmony and synchronization. These people become the target of the entity. And unfortunately, the entity will keep on revisiting these people, as often as possible, and finally the entity succeeds in creating a niche in their Khateyn Tarika. Those who have had a troubled childhood are particularly vulnerable, and if their Khateyn Tarika becomes periodically distant from their body, the entities’ visits become more frequent. *** *** *** "},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":" 195 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ b. People entering your zone: Just like entities and spirits, others (Human beings) can also invade your zone. They enter your Khateyn Tarika through their “Double”. Siblings and children who had an unpleasant relationship/rapport with their parents, especially with their mothers, suffer from this Double’s invasion, more frequently than others. Allamah Sharaf Al Diin stated verbatim: “Some people could become more annoying than spirits. Usually, it is the Atmashabah of the mother who invades the zone of her adult children. Because there is a permanent link between mother and child, the Double of the mother could easily enter between the two lines of the child’s zone, especially when the Double of the child has left an empty place between these two lines. This happens, when the Double has been kicked out by misalignment of Khateyn Tarika.” A very disturbing scenario takes place in this situation. It is quite common to sense the Atmashabah of the mother screaming at her child, and the child reacting very aggressively toward what he/she conceives to be his/her real mother manifesting in the flesh. *** *** *** But what is Atmashabah? Atmashabah is composed of two words found in Ana’kh, the language of the Anunnaki, in Ulemite, the language of the Anunnaki-Ulema, in the language of the Sahiriin, and in Arabic. Atma means darkness. Shabah means a ghost, a phantom. Thus, the general meaning is the darkness of a ghost. Darkness of a ghost is a metaphoric expression/interpretation for the grayish gluey substance that constitutes the manifestation of a ghost."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" 196 Chapter 4: Hidden esoteric knowledge, Khateyn Tarika ______________________________________________________ Some spiritists call it ectoplasma. But the word ectoplasma is not quite correct. In ancient times, ecto was understood and written as exo, meaning out of, outside, and is of Greek origin. It refers to a substance that exits from the orifices of the human body (Nose, mouth, eyes). But what we have here, is not a substance that comes out of the body, but a substance that is independently produced by the Double of another person, without using human body orifices. c. Entities and spirits entering your zone. See a. d. Entering other people’s zone: If others can enter your zone, so too can you enter the zone of other people. This happens when your Double escapes for a short time. Your Double can enter so many places on Earth, as well as in adjacent and parallel dimensions. I have written extensively on this subject in my previous books, and I am not about to repeat myself in this present tome. But briefly and rapidly let me point out the following: A healthy Double can be guided and instructed to explore many zones and various spheres of existence, and bring back a wealth of information on all sorts of things, objects, people and places. A Double that has been “kicked out” of your Khateyn Tarika is worthless. It would annoy others, and disrupt the harmonious flow and flux of their zones. This means that you (with your Double bouncing all around everywhere but within your two lines of Khateyn Tarika) would unnerve or perturb the harmonious energy of others. People would say “something about his/her energy/vibe is offputting.” *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":" 197 chapter 5 summary of commands in this book   "},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":" 198    "},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":" 199 Chapter 5: Summary of commands in this book ______________________________________________________ If a bad entity manages to squeeze in (A sudden, unannounced and unwanted apparition) during the séance, throw water at it/her/him, and instantly pronounce this command: Ya mal’oun Ya afrit ibn Afrit, Ikh-rouj Ikh-rouj Amuru kum Bisma Al Khader wa Al Asma Al Housna.

Blue is the color of those whose thoughts and intentions are most pure. The lines store information pertaining to the thoughts and intentions of a person, similar to data you would be able to read from the magnetic stripe of a credit card/green card/ identity card etc. The colors are similar to those you see within the flame of a candle.

Question #3: Does the Double have a Fik’r of its own? Answer: By its very definition, the Double has everything that we have except a physical body. However, the physical body cannot produce an identical copy of itself. Whereas the Double, reproduces multiple copies of our physical bodies in other dimensions. However, it is not possible for two identical physical copies to co-exist in the same dimension. You can’t have two copies of yourself in the same dimension; in other words, while you exist in this physical world (On Earth), another copy of yourself concurrently exists in another world. Per contra, higher entities can duplicate themselves indefinitely in the same dimension, if they so choose, and can do so instantly.

Question #5: In what situations/circumstances, might a bad entity squeeze in, and manifest itself uninvited, right behind the entity we have summoned? Answer: Spirits are found everywhere. Some live in confined areas, others, right here, on Earth, around us, wherever we go, and lots of them follow us. Allamah Sadek bin Jaafar Al Kouraychi said, “Hawa lil Al Arwaah, Arwaah al Hawa”, meaning, “Air for the spirits, the spirits of the air.” He meant that the air we breathe, the atmosphere we live in are full of spirits and entities. The unseen world is their habitat, and it is an immense world full with spirits and entities. Some entities want to enter the world of the living and create a rapport with us. They have their own agenda. One way to do it is to invade our zone, the space defined by the Khateyn Tarika. This zone is their gateway and passage to our bodies and mental faculties. As soon as our mind is weakened for a variety of reasons, particularly financial and emotional reasons, the Khateyn Tarika weaken considerably, and our Double becomes agitated. If the situation worsens, the two lines of the Khateyn Tarika begin to distance themselves from our physical body."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":" 212 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ And when these two lines cross over the distance of 6 feet, which is normally our safe zone, the Double is instantly displaced, and pushed out of the two lines. This is a very dangerous situation, because we have lost the Double as a guardian, and we have lost the two lines as our protective shield. This is the moment bad spirits would invade our zone. And the door becomes wide open to a fleet of uninvited bad spirits. They enter one after another, unchallenged and head towards our bodies. You can call this possession. Once inside our bodies, our brain (Mind) is instantly perturbed, and the possessed individuals begin to lose their reasoning and mental stability. Some entities will anchor themselves deep within our physical body, and the very fabric of our psyche and emotions. This unquestionably would create mental illness. Possessed people begin to hear voices, and act under the influence of these voices. Some entities move in and outside of our bodies at will. A few of them would manifest in the flesh right in front of us, and this manifestation is terrifying. Quite often when a possessed person tells us about these apparitions, we rush to say “You are seeing things”. Well yes! He/she is seeing things. These things are the very disturbing manifestations of the entities. Financial worries, constant failures, addiction to drugs, and emotional suffering disrupt the peace in our body’s zone. They register on the two lines of Khateyn Tarika. The healthy colors of the two lines begin to deteriorate, to weaken, and finally they distance themselves from our bodies. When the two lines are no longer close to our body, our Double is immediately kicked out from our zone. The bad entities see this. They even smell our emotional problems and fear. "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" 213 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ Like dogs and cats who smell the odor of the sickness of their owners (Especially when these odors and smells are caused by cancer and threatening tumors), the bad entities too smell our worries and fears. And here we have two scenarios: Scenario one pertains to a case when we have summoned an entity not knowing that this entity is from the lower level. Entities from the lower dimensions move in groups. They are never alone. They jointly prey on people. As soon as one of them invades our weakened zone, all the other entities follow. The Bible, several religious scriptures, the Prohet Mohammad, and even Jesus Christ talked about a bunch of bad entities who simultaneously and jointly entered human bodies, and refused to leave. So, as you see, one bad entity always brings along several other entities. Malevolent entities are exactly like wild beasts who hunt jointly in a pack (Wolves, lionesses, hyenas, etc.) *** *** *** Dealing with a bunch of bad entities: Question #6: What should a beginner do if when summoning an entity, finds himself/herself dealing with a whole bunch of them? Answer: The Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin have lots of powerful commands to dispose of the bad entities. You will find plenty of commands to repel and/or send away Afarit, and bad entities in volume one and volume two of this series. The Taaleb must memorize these commands. Some commands deal specifically with this or that entity. This is a very difficult and threatening situation. You can’t tell the bad entities “Hey buddy wait a minute, let me find the command in the book, so I can command and kick your ass out!!” This would be a big mistake."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":" 214 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ This is why I have insisted that beginners and adepts should and must know all these commands by heart. You will have no time at all to regain control of the situation, while making the entities wait, until you find the proper command. It would be too late. And as soon as one bad entity squeezes in, expect to see more malevolent spirits doing the same. *** *** *** Pouring salt around the Burqua’h: Question #7: How should one pour salt around the Burqua’h?

Answer: Always pour salt in a circular manner, starting from right to left. *** *** *** On the odor of Afarit and bad entities: Question #8: Is is true that bad entities and Afarit have a very bad odor? Answer: Yes, they do. A horrible sulphuric odor. This is how we sense their presence when they do not manifest in the flesh. Ironically, the malevolent spirits enjoy this intoxicating smell. In fact, it is through this sulphuric odor that they follow each other. Of course, they do not need to smell each other to recognize each other, since they come from the same Kirba, meaning habitat. But the odor of one “squeezed in” Afrit or bad entity, is an open invitation to other entities to invade our weakened zone and possess our body. The awfully bad odor marks their territory. In this particular case, the territory is our weakened zone. *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":" 215 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ The effect and result of burning a person’s photo during a séance: Question #9: Is it true that burning the photo of a person you are inquiring about, will weaken his/her Khateyn Tarika, and his/her Double? Answer: Burning the photo of a person would cause severe damage to the person, physically, emotionally, and mentally. Once our emotions are no longer controlled by our brain (Mind), the Double begins to suffer, and the Khateyn Tarika will weaken considerably. And if they continue to weaken, they distance themselves from our body. This will expose our zone to threatening situations. Our greatest assets are the Double and Khateyn Tarika. Lose them, and you are in big trouble. Burning a photo during a summoning séance is an act of black magic. You might succeed in hurting that person, but you must keep in mind, that by doing so, you have signed a pact with the bad entity, and the consequences could be tragic. Especially if you are a novice. The Sahiriin who deviated from the path of wisdom and goodness could care less. They are not afraid of the Afarit and bad entities. They know how to deal with them and control them. *** *** *** Bad entities using burning photos to enter other people’s bodies: Question #10: Does the entity who asked you to burn the photo now have an opportunity to enter the body of the person whose photo you burnt during the séance?

But later, they can move in all directions. All spirits always stay outside the Burqua’h. The benevolent spirits, and especially the angels remain in the same place, and do not change position. They do not hover and float like the Afarit and bad entities. These good spirits always appear from within a circle of light, you can call it a ball of light. The Afarit and bad spirits always emerge from the darkest area of the summoning place. Let me establish here a brief comparison between the apparition of good spirits and the apparition of bad spirits. This could guide the novice in his summoning process, and provide the beginner with important information. 1. Angels and good spirits emerge from light, usually taking the shape of a ball, a circle, or a radiating circumference. In some instances, they emerge from a white shadow known to the Rouhaniyiin as Nourashabah. Noura means light, and shabah means a ghost."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":" 217 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ Bad entities and Afarit emerge from the darkest area of the place you use to summon them. The very bad ones called Shaririin announce their apparition with a sulfuric odor. If the room is well lit, they produce a black area similar to Atmashabah, and emerge from this black substance. 2. The good spirits and angels stay still in the same place, while the bad entities and Afarit bounce and float all over the place. 3. Good spirits and angels maintain a peaceful and radiant aura, the bad spirits of the lower dimension and Djinns would and could shape-shift, and change the colors of their skin, causing the aura’s colors to turn darker, even greyish-black. *** *** *** Gender of the entities: Question #13: What is the gender of the entities? Answer: Some are male, some female, and others have no gender whatsoever. The benevolent ones are pleasant to look at. Some female spirits, called by the Sahiriin “Houriyaat”, are absolutely stunning, and drop dead gorgeous, radiating light from their faces and skin, which appears to have a glowing quality to it. *** *** *** Substance/composition of Fik’r: Question #14: Is it true that Fik’r consists of more than just biological human DNA? What else does Fik’r consists of? Answer: Fik’r contains the primordial energy that makes the brain/mind and body function. *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" 218 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ Reprogramming the Fik’r? Question #15: Can we reprogram the Fik’r? Answer: No, we cannot. Whatever Fik’r you were born with, is what is your Maktoob (Destiny; fate; what is written.) However, you can improve the quality of the Fik’r by reaching a higher level of awareness, gained through learning under the wings of an enlightened master (Mounawar. Plural: Mounawarrin) and/or a pure teacher (Taher. Plural: Tahiriin). *** *** *** Did the Anunnaki create us as a slave race? Question #16 : Is it true that the Anunnaki originally created mankind as a slave race, a working class to do their hard labor, work their fields, cultivate the lands, and feed them in ancient Babylon/Mesopotamia/Sumer? Answer: Absolutely!! However they also gave us free will, and plenty of opportunities for progress, learning, self-improvement, and even enlightenment. We cannot change the structure or nature of our DNA, destiny, fate or future, according to the Kanoon Al Maktoob, meaning the “Law of what it is written in the book of our destiny.” We cannot change our DNA, but we can improve on it. You do have the free will to maximize your personal potentials for growth, and achieving goals and aspirations. As an example, if you were assigned the color blue, you cannot change it to red or green, but you can achieve and obtain various shades, and hues of blues within the spectrum of the color blue, such as royal blue, azur-blue, teal and turquoise blue and so on. According to Anunnaki-Ulema Sorenstein, an enlightened master from Odessa, only six men were ever able to manipulate the frequency of their DNA, and see things that others cannot."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" 219 Chapter 6: Q&A ______________________________________________________ This is apparent in the increased productivity of their work, and widely acknowledged accomplishments.

Sorenstein said that Tesla used electromagnetic fields and related frequencies, Carl Jung used tantras and Mandalas, that he was exposed to, during his initiation in spirits’ seances in Tibet, Pythagoras used numerology, Pablo Picasso used colors, and their mathematical language, as he learned it from a Saher (Plural: Sahiriin) in the Basque country. He also had another teacher, a Shaman he studied with in Africa. What the Tibetan Lama, the African Shaman, and the Basque Saher had in common, was their ability to summon higher spirits, that had shown them how to raise the frequencies of their DNA. *** *** ***"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":" 226 "},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":" 227 Table of contents of Voilume 1 ____________________________________________ Table of Contents Table of Contents of Volume I Moukadama (Introduction)...25 ∑ These entities are divided into two groups or classes...26 ∑ 1-Class one, called Moo-Aa-Zabeen...26 ∑ 2-Class two, called Haadeeraat, and sometimes, Arwaah...27 ∑ Language of the Arwaah (Spirits)...28 ∑ How do we talk to entities, spirits, souls, presences, etc.?...28 ∑ Is there an eternal life after death?...29 ∑ Can we befriend Arwaah and spirits?...29 ∑ Any hostile and dangerous Arwaah and Spirits out there?...31 ∑ Where and how to sit?...31 ∑ Where and how to sit?...31...31 ∑ Any particular local to set up the séance?...31 ∑ Any particular time to summon entities and spirits?...31 ∑ Shrouded in secrecy, and authenticity of the materials included in this book...32"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" 228 Table of contents ____________________________________________ ∑ How reliable is the Book of the Arwaah?...33 How to use this book...35 Chapter 1: Glossary/Terminology...37 Chapter 2: Materials and accessories you need for summoning and communicating with spirits and entities...51 ∑ 1.
