In the archaic Sahiriinlanguage, Baab is an entrance to the world ofspirits.In Ulemite, Baab is an entrance to paralleldimensions. In Ana’kh language, it means astargate; a sort of time-space pocket that opens upin parallel dimensions, and multiple zones. TheAnunnaki deploy “split-time-space technology” totravel to any region of the universe in a fraction ofa minute. It could be compared to the “StargateTechnology”. This technology allows the Anunnakito bend time and space and travel to variousdimensions, levels and types of the cosmos, suchas the multiple dimensional world, the parallelword, the future world, including sending andreceiving instant knowledge and messages from"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"and to the beginning of the universe, the beginningof time, and the beginning of motion.This time-space technology is not a monopoly ofthe Anunnaki.

Baa rada hiwan: Verbatim: company of animals.Baa rada means the company of, or being in thepresence of. Hiwan means animals, more preciselydomesticated animals; pets, such as dogs and cats.In the Sahiriin’s literature and esoteric practices,cats play a major role; a role that rotates aroundprediction of events to occur within a short periodof time, and sensing danger. Cats are alsoconsidered a “Psychic Conduit” by Sahiriin andRouhaniyiin.In fact, in some of their black magic Jalasaat(Séances), Sahiriin would bring in a cat to help"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"sense, receive and send messages and predictions.The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions orPredictions of the Cat) was very active in ancientEgypt and the Near East.On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiinstrongly recommend to adopt cats, and care forthem, for they could be very useful to their owners;they are capable of sensing imminent dangers,catastrophes, mishaps, and above all, theirinstinctive nature leads them to warn their owners,little children, and people who love them againstdanger.Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A catin the house is blessing.”Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if theybother to watch, study and understand theirbehavior. Quite often, cats stare at something thehuman eye can’t see. And in some instance, and fora few seconds, cats remain frozen in their attentionupon looking at the unknown which seems toappear to them in etheric forms. The Sahiriin told us that these etheric forms could"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"be spirits, the souls of dead people who areinterested in the occupants of the house, dead littlegirls and boys who can’t realize that they are deadnow, and keep on playing with their toys andrunning right and left in particular parts of thehouse they used to live in; in our case, the currenthouse of the cat who is staring at them.The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attentionto the observing cat, to remain calm and patient,and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat isstaring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat,and to take notes of the reaction of the cat.This exercise of ours should not stop there. Weshould keep on observing our cat, and taking notes,and above all to draw a map of the places in ourhome which seem to interest the cat and/orprovoke the cat to sense the unseen; a map whichcould include more than one place in our home andlocate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a webof openings, a sort of time-space vortices, orsimply a “playground” for spirits.Baa rara kaat wa duu’aat: A set of prayers or"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"chants to be recited to the Noble Spirits, called“Arwaah Nabila”. The word “Duu’aat” means tocall upon, and/or to implore. I-Different kinds of prayers:There are 4 kinds of prayers:1-Duu’aat lil malaa’ikah: Prayers to theangels. Malla’ikah means angels.2-Duu’aat lil Afarit and Djinn.3-Duu’aat lil chaar “Sharr”: Prayers andchants addressed to evil spirits, in which,the Saher orders the entities to cause harmand damages to people.4-Duu’aat lil Arwaah Nabila: Prayersaddressed to the Noble Spirits.

This is a classic prayer, which should be reciteddaily, in order to maintain a “Jisr” (A bridge)between you and the Noble Spirits. Even thoughyou are not in a séance, and you did not summonthe spirits, they can still hear you because they areeverywhere and can hear you without problem.

So how this prayer could protect you from beinghurt by evil and vicious people?There are several prayers you can use for thispurpose, but Duu’aat lil Arwaah Nabila is a verypowerful one, and can be tailored to meet yourneeds in very particular situations. For instance,let’s assume that there is a colleague of yourswhere you work who is constantly disturbing you,and/or hates your guts.Well, you can use this prayer to eliminate his/hervicious intentions; it is simple but requires certainpreparation.

You have simply replaced the word “shariir”.It is not complicated at all.But bear in mind, you must re-write this prayer onSunday evening between 5:00 PM and 10:00 PM. IV-During a séance:If you are in session with a summoned spirit, youdo not need to write down the prayer. It would besufficient to recite it. But you must use the Burqa’haccording to the protocol of the spirits.If you are a seasoned practitioner of Sihr, and youhave succeeded in communicating with a Djinn,just place the prayer in the center of the Burqa’h,and command the summoned entity to read it. V-Public recitation:"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Never ever recite a prayer in public.This is a very serious affair between you and yourspirit.Such spiritual communication should remainconfidential.

Baab Al Shayatiin: The door of the devils.Composed from three words:a- Baab means door.b- Al is “the”.c- Shayatiin means devils. Baab Al Shayatiin appeared in a story mentionedin the “Kitbu Al Sih’r fi Baalback” (Book of Sihrin Baalbeck”).Cheik Al Baydani told us that there is a secretentrance to the habitat of Djinn and Afarit locatedunder “Hajarat Al Houblah” (Stone of the Pregnant"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Woman) in the ancient city of Baalbeck inLebanon.One of his students claimed that there is anunderground tunnel located under the house ofCheik Al Baydani which leads to a hall inhabitedby Djinn; it is a secret passage to another world,the realm of multi-dimensional entities who livedunderground for centuries.This is not a myth, since many people who residenearby Hajarat Al Houblah have seen “DarkGhosts” exiting from under the stone of thepregnant woman.Apparently the Djinn and Afarit of “Hajarat AlHoublah” are under the command of Cheik AlBaydani, who is 210 year old. Legend has it thatthose Djinn and Afarit are the custodians andguardians of the Book of Ramadosh.Here is an excerpt from the story of the Djinn andAfarit in Baalbeck:Background: At one time, a large community oflower entities called “Beit al Jin” (House of theDjinn) strived underground near the ruins of theRoman temples of Baalbeck."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Hajarat Al Houblah. “Hajarat Al Houblah” was used in Baalbek’s Great Platform.According to Phoenician legend, stones like this one weremoved by the Anunnaki and Afarit, using levitation, and"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"teleportation. _______________________________ The Beit was guarded by three principal djinnswho shape-shifted constantly, during their firstcontact (Apparition) with human beings.According to a local legend, some of these lowerentities were the remnants of the Afarit who haveserved King Solomon.

I watched the process infascination, since he was not doing it quickly like anormal person, but instead was slowly extricatinghimself in stages, gradually disentangling himself,like a huge snake. I have never seen such a tallman, or anyone as strange.He was about seven feet tall, very thin,and his face did not look quite human to me, butlike a giant from outer space.

Theunderground city is actually called the City of theDjinn and the Afrit; plenty of devils are there.”Since these devils did not seem to frighten"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"the Master, I assumed he knew what he was doing,and sat thinking about what my part could be in thisunbelievable adventure. However, I was aware ofincreasing irritation by what Taj was doing.He constantly played with his amberbeads, clicking away on and on.

The Master screamed at Taj, “How dareyou? How many times did I tell you never to dothat? Give me the beads immediately!”Taj handed him the beads, meekly enough,and had the grace to look embarrassed. The Masterrubbed the beads, seemingly absorbing andremoving the energy, and then returned them to me.“You can try them now,” he said. “And don’t givethem back to Taj until I tell you to.”Taj said nothing. He seemed unhappy inthe car, constantly fidgeting, and could not sit still.Perhaps he was claustrophobic, I thought, and theconfined space bothered him. We drove on. Finally we arrived in Baalbeck. “Wherenow?” said the driver. “We are going to the Athar, the ruins,”said the Master. “I don’t know how to get there,” said the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"driver. “Shall I ask for directions?” He parked thecar. There were many people around, some Arabsin traditional garb, some Europeans in every kindof attire and carrying backpacks and cameras. Itseemed to be such a normal, cheerful place.I thought of the festivals and the music;how could there be Afrit and Djinn and all sorts ofunderground labyrinths in a place like that? It wasas modern as can be. “When you are with Taj, you do not askfor directions,” said the Sudanese with a superiorair.The driver shrugged, not quite convinced.Taj winked at me and stared at the driver’sneck, concentrating. The driver suddenly started tobeat his own neck, complaining how much he hatedmosquitoes. I was certain there were nomosquitoes in the car, and I was sure that Tajcreated the imaginary insects that were tormentingthe driver.The driver’s neck became really red. “Taj, stop this nonsense immediately!”said the Master severely. Apparently, Taj could"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"send certain energy rays that had the capacity ofannoying people. Taj stopped, gave the driver thenecessary directions, and we went to the Athar. “First, let’s go to the world biggeststone,” said Taj. We drove further, and as weturned a road toward the Temple of Jupiter, I wasshocked by the sight that met my eyes. It was ahuge gray slab, partially buried in the sand,perfectly cut and smooth.It was unquestionably man made, not anatural formation, a short distance from theTemple. How in the world could such a stone getthere?Who could have carried it?This stone was so immense that the stonesof the Egyptian pyramids would be infinitely small,completely dwarfed, if put next to it.The Stonehenge monoliths would beinsignificant if they were placed next to it. Inaddition, it was immensely old, and even modernequipment could hardly cope with such a giant, letalone ancient technology. “How big is this stone?” I asked, truly"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"awed by the sight. “Seventeen hundred tons,” said theMaster. “It is hand made, isn’t it?” I said. “It istoo straight to be natural. It simply can’t be natural.And yet, how could it get here, if it is artificial? Itjust can’t!” Taj grinned and said, “Hand made, yes,but not by human hands.” I was beginning to get the idea. “Thenwho made it?” I asked. “It was part of the landing area used bythe Anunnaki,” said the Master. “There are sixstones like it. Only the Anunnaki could move sucha slab.” “Ah, but I can make it fly,” boasted Taj. “You must be crazy,” I said, disgustedwith him. “You want to see?” He said. “Sure,” I said. “I would like to see you dothat.”“Very well, but not when so many people arearound. We will be back around nine o’clock, no"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"one is around, I will show you.” Since it was around four o’clock in theafternoon, I was wondering how we would spendthe time, but the Master had his own plan. “We have plenty of time to do what needsto be done,” he said. “I would like you to meetCheik Al Huseini.” This was the first time I met thegreat man, who later contributed greatly to mystudies. We went back into the car, and drove tothe Cheik’s house. The house was small andmodest, built sturdily of stone, with thick walls.The door was low, as was normal for middle classArab houses. This style was followed for manyyears, for the sake of safety and security.Apparently, the conquering Ottomans usedto sweep into houses that had large entrances whileriding on their horses, and thus be able to kill anddestroy anyone and everything inside. The lowentrances forced the rider to get off his horse first,making him much less dangerous to the inhabitants.In the big living room, which they calledthe Dar, many sofas were placed against the walls,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"arranged next to each other. About twenty to thirtymen were present, dressed in Arab robes andturbans. All were elderly, with long white beards.The Cheik was sitting in the place of honor.When the Master arrived, everyone stoodup, repeating the word “oustaz, oustaz,” to eachother, meaning “teacher.” Someone pointed at Taj,and said, “The Afrit is already here.” I thought thisdescription fitted Taj perfectly, but expected him tobe angry. To my surprise, he seemed pleased bybeing called that name, and grinned at me like adelighted child. We sat down, and the men came to kiss thehand of the Master. The light was low, only onelamp was turned on, but I could see that one persondid not get up from his seat. Since this was strangebehavior, I looked at him carefully, and to myamazement recognized the old Tuareg, whom I hadmet years ago in the suk in Damascus, the man whowas cut in half.He recognized me as well, smiled, andmotioned to me to come and sit by him. I came, andhe said jokingly, “Don’t start searching for the rest"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"of my body...”I laughed, a little guilty, because that was exactlywhat I was planning to do. At any rate I could seenothing, since the long robe he wore coveredeverything. Everyone conversed in Arabic, whichby now I spoke very well, and after a while theCheik motioned most people out. Eight of usremained in the room.The Master, Taj, and myself, were the onlyoutsiders.The Cheik, the Tuareg, and three otherelderly Arabs completed the number of the peoplewho were permitted to attend. At that moment, a man came from aninside room, carrying a big copper pot, full ofsteaming hot water. He put the pot on a table infront of the Cheik, addressing him by the titleMawlana.This title meant “you are a ruler over me,”and was used only to address kings, sultans, orprophets. I was surprised. This title belonged tovery important people, but the house andeverything in it spoke of middle class. So what"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"could this mean? The Cheik must have been a veryimportant person, somehow. I planned to ask theMaster about it later, not wishing to disturb himwith questions at the moment, since I was surestrange things were about to begin to occur.I was sitting near enough to the Cheik tosee everything very clearly, and waitedbreathlessly for the events that were to come. TheCheik took three pieces of blank paper, and threwthem into the hot water in the copper container.The room was completely silent, no onemoved, except Taj, who whispered to me, “You aregoing to like what you see, it’s fun, but don’t moveno matter what happens.” I nodded, andconcentrated on the pot, looking occasionally atTaj for clarification.Somehow he assumed the role of my guideto the occult world, and I realized he knew exactlywhat was taking place. “Shush, just look at thecontainer, something is about to happen,” he said. Iwent on staring at the pot. Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, the waterin the container disappeared, and the three pieces"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"of paper burst out of the container. They lined up inthe air, without any support, one after the other.They waved about for a few seconds, then mergedand became one larger piece.The piece of paper started swirling in theair, rotating around itself, quicker and quicker, andsuddenly stopped in mid motion.It was suspended in the air, completelystill, and in a flash, letters appeared on it, printedclear, black, and easily visible from where I wassitting, though I could not make out the words. The Cheik got up, approached the paper, read thewords, and then asked one of the people attendingto close the shutters on all the windows. The roombecame very dark, and the words, seeminglyseparated from the paper, glowed in air like abright hologram. The Cheik called Taj, and asked him toread the words. I could not hear what they said toeach other, but they seemed to agree on something,as they stood there, nodding their heads.Then Taj came back to me."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I asked him, “What was that?” He steppedon my foot to quiet me. His large foot’s imprintwas painful, so I shut up. Everyone else seemed toaccept the phenomenon without trouble, and gazedat the Cheik as he began to move in a strangemanner.He looked to the left, mumbling somethingincoherent, then to the right, saying the sameincomprehensible things, repeating the sequencetwice.Then he lifted his hands as if in prayer, inthe manner shared by both Jews and Muslims.Touching his chest and pushing his hands in front ofhim, he said, “Ahlan, ahalan, ahlan, ahalan, beesalamah.”The letters were still glowing in front ofhim in the air, and he added, “Asma’ oo hoosmahath sab’ha.” I turned and pinched Taj, whisperingfeverishly, “Explain!” “Don’t you know anything?” said Taj.“These are the names of seven Afrits. They aregoing to open the gate of the underworld for us.”"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":" “But...” He stomped on my foot again toshut me up, and it really hurt and I kept quiet.The Cheik said, rather loudly: “Bakhooor,bakhooor!” A man appeared out of nowhere andbrought an incense holder. The Cheik moved itback and forth, the room filled with smoke, andeveryone started to chant and mumble very loudly.I understood nothing at all of what theysaid. It seemed they were speaking in tongues, andthe effect was frightening. They went on for acouple of minutes, then stopped abruptly. At thatinstant, the letters pulled together, became oneshining ball of light of intense silver color, andzoomed out of the room into thin air. One of the people opened the shutters andthe late afternoon light streamed in. The Cheik puthis right hand on his heart and said “Thank you”three times.I was wondering who exactly he wasthanking, and who, originally, was he praying for,since he never used the words God, Allah, or anyother recognizable deity name. I did not realize atthe time that the Ulema, even when they were"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Arabs, where not Muslims, and had their own,very different, world view. The Master got up. Everyone rose withhim, their robes swishing and making a faint soundin the quiet room. The Tuareg floated in the air. Ilooked at him, doing my best to control mydiscomfort. His upper body was solid, but thebottom half of the robe was obviously empty as itswirled around him, making the absence of hislower body extremely and disturbingly clear. Heseemed like an apparition, a ghost. Everyone came to the Master, bowed tohim, and then grabbed his hand with both of theirs,in a way that was clearly ceremonial.The right hand’s thumb was hitting the spotbetween the thumb and first finger of the left hand,and then the left hand covered the right hand.The Tuareg floated near the master and didthe same thing. Everyone looked at each other andthanked each other a few times, following theirthanks with the words “Rama Ahaab.” I did notknow this word, and was not aware that they werespeaking Ana’kh, the language that was shared by"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the Anunnaki and the Ulema.And yet I sensed that there was somethingvery special about the way they spoke, as if byinstinct. I was staring at the people and trying tounderstand their words until the Master tapped meon the shoulder and told me to come out. Taj left with me, and said, “You talk toomuch. You should be paying more attention, suchan occasion is not likely to happen again!” Ishrugged, but I had to admit to myself that he wasright, these events were probably unique.To my surprise, I was beginning to like theSudanese, and no longer felt threatened by hisstrange appearance and bizarre behavior.“Won’t you tell me a bit about the Afrit?” I asked,licking my lollipop. “I am not sure why we need tocall them. Why can’t we just go into theunderground city? I don’t quite understand anythingthat is going on here.” “In your home, in France, do you have aJaras, a bell, on your door?” he asked. “Yes, of course,” I said, surprised at the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"question. “Well, you see, the underground city donot have a Jaras, and it is locked. If you want tocome in, someone must let you in. The Afrit canhelp you, but you have to call them in a specialway. Otherwise, they don’t know you want them toopen the door. How would they know? They arenot too clever.” “Where is the door?” I said. He pointed to the ground. “Under you,under the house, there is a door. Right under theCheik’s house. A door to the Aboo, the deep abyss.It is also called Dahleeth, meaning an undergroundlabyrinth.” “Are there other doors?” “Very likely, but I only know this one.”As if reading my mind, he put his hand inthe inner pocket of his ill fitting and flashy jacket,pulled out two lollipops, and handed me one. One of the people came out of the house,motioned to us to come in, and said, “We areready.” In the house, everyone was wearing awhite robe, and to my surprise, their heads were"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"covered with the type of head scarf Jewssometimes wore in the synagogue. To confuse theissue even further, one was holding a scroll thatresembled a Torah.I felt desperate. Were they going to delayour journey again and start praying? I reallywanted move on, see the Afrit, have the adventure.I was tired of the delays. Thankfully, one of themhanded me a robe and commanded me to go changemy clothes, which I did, but Taj did not change hisattire.I asked him why he was not required to doso, and he explained that he was not one of the AlMoomawariin, or the enlightened ones, so he wasnot required to wear the special outfit.This did not really clarify the matter, sinceI was not one of the enlightened ones either, but Idecided to let it pass. Taj seemed to be right about the doorbeing under the Cheik’s house, because we startedto descend the steps to the basement. The basementwas long and narrow, and had a very high ceiling,perhaps the height of two stories. Everything, floor,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"walls, ceiling, were made entirely of gray cement.It smelled of dampness, and was very cold.We went through a one room after another,all narrow and long, eventually reaching a smallroom that had an iron gate by its far wall. TheCheik opened the gate with a large key, and behindit was a second door, made of thick wood. Asecond key opened this one. Suddenly a thoughtstruck me.Why did he need a key?Why couldn’t a man who had such supernaturalpowers simply command the doors to open? Orpass through them like a ghost, for that matter?I expressed my thought to Taj. “It won’twork,” said Taj. “Yes, of course the Cheik couldpass through doors, but how would he take youwith him?”  “What do you mean?” I asked,bewildered. “You are not enlightened as yet. Youcannot use supernatural means of transportation atthis stage, so if he wants you, or me, for that matter,to pass through these doors, he must take you"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"inside in a normal way. If he tried, you will justbang against the doors and hurt yourself, while hewould be on the other side.” I began to see that Tajwas not stupid at all. Childish, and sometimespretending to be silly and play silly games, butdeep down, he was extremely knowledgeable. We stood together in the small room,exactly like all the other rooms in the basement.The Cheik said, “Let the boy be the last one. Heneeds protection. Taj, come here.”Taj joined him at the front of the line, andwe entered a long corridor. As we were walking,the corridor began to shift its shape.I felt seasick, nauseated, my balance waslost. The floor, and walls, everything was moving,rolling, undulating.I did not see clearly, and wondered howlong this torment would last, when suddenly allmovement stopped.I looked around and nearly jumped withterror. The simple corridor became a cave!A natural cave, not a man made structure.Stone, dirt, and natural formations were"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"all around me. It smelled damp and filthy, waterwere oozing from some of the walls, and the lightwas dim. I did not like the place.The Master told everyone except me tostand in a crescent shaped row, and hold hands. Heordered me to stand behind the crescent, and not totouch anyone. I was hurt. I felt neglected, as if Iwere not part of the group, until one of the peopleturned to me and said kindly, “Don’t be upset, myboy. This is for your protection.”So I just stood there behind the people,feeling silly in my long white robe, but not unhappyanymore.At that moment, Taj made a sweepingmotion with his hands and body, and screamed afew words. The horrible sound he emitted was nothuman. It was very likely the loudest sound I hadever heard.He continued to move his hands violently,grabbed some dirt from the ground, and threw it upin the air. He pronounced a word that to mesounded like a name, and followed it by the word“Eehdar!” three times."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Then he said, “Oodkhool,” three times.Immediately, a rubbery kind of form moved to theleft, changed to a paste-like substance, andattached itself like glue to the wall. The sticky,pale mess looked like ectoplasm.Taj repeated his actions a few times, manifesting anew ectoplasmic manifestation on the wall witheach call. Then, he looked at the Cheik and said,“Tamam!” The Cheik and Taj were engaged in aconversation in low voices. They seemed to be inagreement, since the Cheik said, “Yes, go ahead.”Taj advanced toward the ectoplasmic forms, puthis hand in his jacket’s pocket and took somethingout, and gave some to each of them.At this moment, the Cheik stepped forward, readyto take over, and said “Iibriiz!” The forms burstinto flame, which burned the ectoplasm andproduced a thick fog. From the fog appeared humanforms, but there were only six of them.The Cheik said “Wawsabeh!” The Mastercame forward, stood by the Cheik, and the Cheikrepeated the word, adding, “Anna a’mooree"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"khum!” and the seventh creature came. Later Taj told me that these Afrit wereoriginally created by the Cheik for a reason, asthey usually are, and in the normal state of eventswere supposed to become the Cheik’s loyalservants.However, the Cheik made a mistake anddid not perform the exact requirements needed inthe procedure of the creation, and therefore he lostcontrol over the Afrit.The result was disturbing.The seven Afrit developed independentand rather evil habits, and did not quite obey theCheik as they should. For some reason, the onlyone who could call them to appear was Taj.However, that is all he could do. Since Tajwas not an Enlightened One, he could not controlthem once they came, and to a certain extent was attheir mercy and had to have an Ulema present if hewere to avoid potential harm.As for another Ulema controlling theminstead of Taj and the Cheik, that was not possible.The Ulema have four categories, based on their"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"form of existence. Some Ulema are physical andlive as humans, like the Master and the Cheik.Some used to be physical, but were no longer so.Some, like the Tuareg, straddled bothforms. Others have never occupied a human form.All four versions of the Ulema can exerciseimmense powers, no matter if they are physical ornon physical, but a physical Ulema can onlycontrol non physical entities, such as these Afrits,if he was their creator. I shuddered as I watched the Afrit. At thispoint of my studies, I had my share of supernaturalincidences, but I have never been so shaken before.In the semi darkness of this miserable, damp place,the Afrits were truly terrifying.Each had a more or less human face, but inthis almost normal face the eyes were not at allnormal. Instead, each Afrit had two circular orbs,with white background and a black pupil that stoodout as if painted. The eyes did not move.If the Afrit wanted to look to the side, ithad to move its whole head. The head was notconnected to the body. Instead, it floated in a"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"disconcerting, eerie fashion, just above the body.When the Afrit manifest, their bodies often appearfirst and for a few minutes appears headless, untilthey choose to manifest the head.This fact, coupled by their appallingugliness, can frighten a human being to the point ofdeath. There had been recorded incidents ofpeople dying of heart attack or stroke caused bysuch events.I kept myself as calm as possible andcontinued to study the Afrit. The heads were badenough, but the bodies were even worse.They were tinted a shadowy, ugly, darkcolor. The torso resembled the shape of a bat.Their arms were attached to the back of the body,and the hands had extremely long fingers. Since theAfrit don’t eat or breathe, they don’t need astomach and a diaphragm.Therefore, the body had a sort of visiblecavity in the front, where these organs would havebeen. The legs were twisted, like entangled wires,which must help the Afrit as they jump. They rarelystay in one place for long, and keep shaking and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"moving and twitching.They looked back at us, their ugly facestwisted in a devilish, vicious smile. They keptchattering among themselves and pointing at uswith their long fingers.But Taj told me that despite their apparentboldness, they were afraid of the EnlightenedOnes. Any Afrit can see the shining auras of theUlema, and for some reason they are terrified ofthese auras. The Cheik commanded the Afrit to openthe door. I did not understand the language hespoke, but I figured it out because he used the word“Babu,” which is so similar to the word Ba’ab.Babu is really a door, though, while ba’ab is agate, but the words were close enough to make itclear to me that they were going to open the door tothe underground world.I was speechless with anticipation.Everyone stood still, looking at the far wall of thecave, so I stared at it too, not knowing what toexpect. The far wall of the cave suddenly"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"collapsed, in total silence. It felt like a silentmovie, because there was no dust and no sound offalling stones during the procedure.The stones tumbled down quietly, one by one,disappearing altogether rather than forming asolid pile.The wall was replaced by dark, hazy fog, thatallowed us a glimpse of some far away buildings.“Now,” said the Cheik to Taj, “Let’s follow theAfrit, but don’t let them play tricks on you.”Taj nodded. We went through the fog,following another corridor and crossing identicalrooms that seemed to follow each other insuccession, all the while seeing the far offbuildings in the distance. The Cheik started reciting something.The Afrit were jumping up and down likecarousel horses, while pushing forward with greatspeed, and were already a good distance awayfrom us, going on their own mysterious errands.Taj said to me, “You can now move to thefront, it’s safe now, the Afrit won’t pay muchattention to us anymore.” I quickly moved near the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Master at the head of the line, and no one tooknotice of what I was doing. We did not move onyet.The Cheik asked Taj to show him a pieceof paper he was holding, probably a kind of a map,and asked, “Do you know which room we need?” “Yes,” said Taj. “I know exactly where itis, it’s very near us. I will go in, and if I findsomething, I will bring some pieces back to you soyou can see them, and then we can all go in andbring everything.” Taj left for about five minutes, andreturned with a beautiful pearl necklace, a fewdiamonds, and some Phoenician coins.He told the Cheik and the Master, “We cango in now, but remember, you promised that all thegold belongs to Taj.” “Of course,” said the Cheik casually. “Butremember,” said the Master, “We are not just goinginto the treasure room. You will also take us to theother room, as you promised.” It was clear to me that the Ulema were notin the least interested in the treasure, but there was"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"something else in this underground cavern thatmeant much more to them than any gold ordiamonds.The Ulema do not need gold. They can manufacturewhatever wealth they need, and they nevermanufacture or acquire more than they need.Riches are of no interest to them at all.“Certainly I will take you to the other room,” saidTaj. “I know exactly where it is.” He seemed quitepleased by the bargain. We followed Taj into a small, closedroom. It had no windows but was brightly lit,allowing us to see gold, gems, diamonds, andpearls stashed in boxes, jars, or simply thrown onthe floor in heaps. However, I was not veryinterested in gold either.What I wondered about was the source ofthe mysterious illumination. No windows, nolamps, no candles, but bright light in every cornerof the room. What could cause this?Suddenly I realized it had to be the sametype of light that was discovered in the Pharaonictombs and catacombs of ancient Egypt."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Originally, the archaeologists who wentthere were baffled by the light in the Egyptiantunnels, until they discovered the contraption thatthe ancient Egyptians had created. They foundconical objects that functioned like modernbatteries, producing light that was so much likenormal electrical light that there was hardly adifference.The batteries had to be placed in a certainway against each other, or they would not light, andworse, could burn the user since they packed a lotof energy in their structure. I suspected this had tobe the same type of illumination. Taj pointed the door that would take us tothe room the Master wished to visit. The Masterasked him, “Do you want to come with us?”“I will follow you as soon as I am finishedhere,” said Taj, grinning. He pulled some linenbags from under his jacket, and busily startedfilling them with the treasure.The Master smiled indulgently at him, as ifTaj was a child playing with some toys that meantlittle to adults but pleased the child a great deal."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"He said to the rest of us, “Well then, let’s go to thenext room.”We opened the door. Inside it was pitchblack, but the Master stepped in without theslightest hesitation, and we followed. I envied hisconfidence.As far as I was concerned, how did weknow an angry Afrit was not waiting for us?But since no one else showed any fear, Iwent with them. We could see nothing, but theMaster kept talking to us and so we were able tofollow him. All of sudden, bright light filled theroom.I blinked a few times, and then saw theMaster standing by one of the walls, holding twoconical, golden objects in each hand, positionedagainst each other. I was right, here were theancient batteries. The room was empty of furniture otherthan a beautiful wooden table, carved intoarabesques, much like Moroccan furniture.The Master placed the batteries carefullyon the table, making sure the alignment allowed"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"them to continue to produce light. I looked around.Other than the batteries and the table, the onlyobject in the room was a large Phoenician urn,standing in one of the corners. “We are going to leave you here for ashort while,” said the Master to the group. “TheCheik and I are going to get the materials we needfor our project.”“We’ll be right back,” added the Cheikwith what seemed to me rather misguidedoptimism. There were Djinn and Afrit here! Wasn’tanyone concerned about these devils?The Master and the Cheik walked to theend of the room, very slowly, with measured,matching steps, as if choreographed. Then theyreached the far wall, and literally went through thewall to the other side.I was not exactly shocked, since I haveseen the Master go through walls before. It is aninteresting phenomenon, but not as mysterious asone might think.To put it simply, the Ulema know how tocontrol molecules; the Master had explained it to"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"me thoroughly. Everyone knows that there is plentyof empty space between the molecules of anymatter, and the Ulema make use of that fact with aspecialized procedure.As the person who wishes to crossapproaches the wall, the wall gradually becomessoft, as if its molecules fragment themselves, andthe human body simultaneously does the same.The spaces between the molecules of bothgrow and readjust. The person and the wall keeptheir shapes for an instant, then their moleculesmingle and allow the passage.At that moment, the person passes to theother side, the molecules separate, and both walland person become solid and normal again. The rest of us waited for about half anhour. I was beginning to worry. The Cheik saidthey would be right back! Something must haveprevented them from doing so. Perhaps the Afrit, who has by nowcompletely disappeared, took them away,kidnapped them, led them somewhere horrible? Iasked some of the other people if they knew what"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"was going on, but they had no idea where the Cheikand the Master went.However, they did not seem worried,making it clear to me that they trusted these two toknow what to do. “Don’t worry,” one of them saidto me. “They can handle a lot worse than thosestupid Afrits.”“I don’t wish to contradict, Sir,” I said,“but these Afrit seem pretty dangerous to me. Theway they were pointing and smiling...” The otherslaughed. “I have seen the Cheik and the Masterhandle much worse entities,” said the man whospoke to me, very kindly. “Remember, the Afristare cowards. They are mortally afraid of the aurasof the Ulema.”“But I understand the Cheik needs somehelp because of the way he handled their creation,”I said.“Yes, this is true,” said the man. “TheseAfrit did turn out a bit wild. But with the Masterthere, they will never dare to harm them.” I had tobe content with that. So I went in search of Taj, tosee how he was doing with the treasure, perhaps"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"help him finish filling his bags.I called him and was about to reenter theroom, but I heard him scream, “Don’t come here!”and he tumbled out of the room, bleeding, andslammed the door behind him. “The Afrit beat me,”he gasped. “Beat me very badly.”“But Taj, you could handle those sevenAfrit so well! What happened to give them powerover you?”“Seven? Are you joking? There is acolony here, something like forty of fifty Afrit, andthey all rushed at me and would not let me take thegold.”“Is it their gold?” I asked. “What do theywant it for, anyway? They don’t need money.”“No, it’s not their gold. It used to belong tothe Phoenicians, and now it belongs to no one inparticular. But the Afrit like to play with it. Theylike shining things.”“But you are holding one bag, I see.”“Yes, I managed to save one bag. They gotall the others, those slimy devils.” He smiled,regaining his composure. “Never mind, though."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"After all, I will be a very wealthy man even withjust one bag. This treasure is amazing... Anyway,we must secure the door. Hold the bag for aminute.” He pushed the bag in my hands, turned,and repeated the same words he used when heoriginally called the Afrit, and gestured in the sameway.While he was doing that, I heard shrieksand screams, which he later explained was the waythe Afrit spoke as they were chased away. “That isthat,” he said, surveying the door with satisfaction.“They won’t bother us again.” He took the bag andsmiled at me through the caked blood and filth onhis face. “A successful treasure hunt, ah, Germain?And some day I’ll come back for more.” Back in the other room, I saw, to myconsiderable relief, that the Cheik and the Masterhave returned. The Cheik was holding a stack offorty or fifty sheets made of shiny plastic, orplasma, or glass, and the Master had the same sizestack, but of a different type of material, brownishyellow like corn."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":" “What is that?” I asked Taj. “I have no idea,” said Taj. “They onlytold me which room I was supposed to take themto, but they did not tell me what project they wereengaged in. I must sayI have a hunch it is something terriblyimportant.” I thought so too, since the Cheik andthe Master seemed to be extremely solemn, andeveryone else was completely silent. There was astrong feeling of expectation in the room.They each put his stack on the table, theCheik on the right, the Master on the left, leaving aspace between the stacks, and I noticed that thespace matched the size of the stacks.The Master brought the urn from the cornerto the table, and made a motion of pouringsomething out of the urn into the space between thestacks. I saw nothing coming out of the jar, but Ifigured that it might be an invisible substance.This went on for about twenty seconds,then the Master returned the urn to the corner. TheCheik took one sheet from his stack, and put it inthe space between the stacks. The Master then took"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"a sheet from his own stack, put it on the Cheik’ssheet, and waited a couple of seconds.Then the Master flipped his sheet backside up, and to my absolute amazement, there wasprint on the sheet, strong and black, consisting ofstrange symbols and letters I did not recognize.Piling the sheets on top of each other, theydid the same to all of them. Surprisingly, the stack,when finished, was reduced in size to about a halfof the original sheets, even though I could not see itreducing itself while it was worked on. I think thatthe plasma sheets were absorbed into the corn-likepaper as the print was produced, but I am not sure.The Cheik pulled out a silk scarf from his robe, putthe stack on the scarf, rolled it, lifted the ends ofthe scarf and tied them together, all in a ritualisticway. Then he said, “Al Hamdu” twice. They turned to go, and we left the room.The Master, throughout the entire time, paid hardlyany attention to me, which bothered me a little. Ifelt neglected, even abandoned. He must havenoticed my unhappy face, because he put his handon my shoulder, took me back into the room, and"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"said, “Look!” To my amazement, the room wasentirely empty. The table and the urn haddisappeared.I was confused and uncomfortable.I could not understand why all that was necessary.Why Afrit? Why those doors?Where did the table go?What was this document and why was itworth all this effort? He laughed at my questionsand said, “Look at the wall.” The light wasdimming as we spoke, and finally disappeared. Itseemed this adventure was over, and I said,rebelliously, that I wish things were made clear tome, because otherwise, I have learned nothing.I will explain everything later, Germain. Ipromise” “But what about the city you said we areabout to see?The city where the Founding Fathers of theUlema used to come to?The city from before the Deluge?” “So you want to see more? This was notenough?”"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" “Yes,” I said. “Basically, all I saw wasyou and the Cheik going through a wall and Tajfighting with the Afrit, which I admit were scarybut were not too significant, I believe. I did not seeanything remotely connected to the ancient city.” “Well,” he said, “in this case, turn, andwalk with me. You are already walking in thiscity.” I looked around, and saw nothing, but hesaid, “Keep walking, it will come.” I should have trusted him more fully. Afterall, when did he ever disappoint me? I feltremorseful as the miracle began to enfold in frontof my eyes, but thankfully, he did not hold my shortterm rebellion against me, and went on cheerfullyenough.Slowly, the ancient city started to appear like aPolaroid picture in front of me. The colors of thecity were such as I have never seen before,glowing colors of incredible beauty.The Master explained that this was because thecity was located in a space that had the sametemperature everywhere, and no pressure on any"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"object. Unlike earth. “What do you mean, Master, when you say‘unlike earth’ like that? Are we not on earth?” “No, we have left earth when the Afritopened the door and made the cave wall collapse.We are now in another dimension,” said theMaster. “Everything looks a little different here.”The city became clearer, and I thought it lookedlike a holographic projection, either from the past,or from the future.The buildings, though beautiful, had asense of alien, remote places.We were now walking in a well-illuminated street,the windows of the buildings shining with lights aswell. The air was soft and fragrant. “I see buildings and streets,” I said. “Butwhere are the people?” “They are here, but they are invisible toyou. Your eyes are not constructed to see them, notyet,” he said.“Well, it is time to leave. Let’s go up thesestairs.” We started climbing a very high, stonestairway that led from the street into a destination"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"that was not quite visible.I was surprised that we were not retracing outsteps into the Cheik’s house, but the Master saidthere was no need for that, and that exits wereavailable in various locations, and not as difficultto achieve as entrances.So we climbed the stairs, and when wereached the top, I saw a huge gray wall on my left,and noticed that the pavement turned into sand.The huge gray wall was the side of theAnunnaki stone.I understood that we exited from a holeunder the big stone, were out of the strangedimension, and back on earth. “So that is what Taj meant when he saidhe would make the stone fly?” I said. “Yes, a rather poetic way of describingour trip,” said the Master. “Master, I am not wearing the white robe!I am wearing the normal clothes I left at theCheik’s house.” “Indeed, and so is everyone else,” hesaid, pointing to the rest of the company, who were"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"already standing near the giant stone, and wearingnormal clothes. “So what did we come here for?

And now we haverecovered a copy of the most important book in theworld.” “The strange book you printed from thestacks? What is it?” “It is one of the very few copies inexistence of what is probably the oldest book tohave ever been written. A book the Anunnaki hadvalued very much. It is called The Book of RamaDosh.” I didn’t know why, but a shiver wentthrough my spine when I heard the name of theAncient book; the sound of the name triggered areaction in my mind.
