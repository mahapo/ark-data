Man the hunter and man the farmer suddenly became man the city dweller, and within a mere few hundred years he was practicing advanced mathematics, astronomy and metallurgy! The place where these first cities suddenly arose was ancient Mesopotamia, in the fertile plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where the country of Iraq now lies. The civilization was called Sumer, the “birthplace of writing and the wheel”,’ and fro m its very beginning it bore a striking resemblance to our own civilization and culture today. There, in ancient Sumer... urban living and literacy flourished in cities with names such as Ur, Lagash, Eridu and Nippur. Sumerians were early users of wheeled vehicles and were among the first metallurgists, blending metals into alloys, extracting silver from ore, and casting bronze in complex molds. However in the 19 th century and 20 th century, significant excavations have revealed some incredible insights as to the real reason behind the rapid advancement of this incredible civilization. 1 THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND WARFARE 5 2 CLAY TABLETS – THE RECORD OF SUMERIAN KNOWLEDGE 13 3 THE ANUNNAKI ACCORDING TO ZECARIAH SITCHIN 17 4 THE ANUNNAKI ACCORDING TO MAXIMILLIEN DE LAFAYETTE 22 5 SUMERIA IN BIBLICAL CONTEXT 25 6 THE BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE FALLEN ONES 29 7 APOCRYPHA REVEALS A TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION 36 8 RECONCILING SUMERIAN HISTORY WITH THE BIBLE 40 9 THE ROYAL BLOODLINES OF EUROPE 42 "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 4  PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 5 1. THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND WARFARE The invention and spread of agriculture coupled with the domestication of animals in the fifth millennium B.C. are acknowledged as the developments that set the stage for the emergence of the first large-scale, complex urban societies. These societies, whi ch appeared almost simultaneously around 4000 B.C. in both Egypt and Mesopotamia, used stone tools, but within 500 years stone tools and weapons gave way to bronze. With bronze manufacture came a revolution in warfare. This period saw the dev elopment of many new weapons, the penetrating axe, armor, helmet, composite bow, the wheel and chariot and gave birth to a number of tactical innovations; phalanx formations, increased mobility, pursuit, emergent staffs and rank structures. It would be inc orrect to conclude, however, that new weapons were responsible for the great increase in the scale of warfare that characterized this period of human history. Improved weaponry, by itself, would have produced only a limited increase in the scale of warfare unless accompanied by new types of social structures capable of sustaining large armies and providing them with the impetus and means to fight on a heretofore unknown scale. The military revolution of the Bronze Age was rooted more in the development of truly complex societies than in weapons and technology. What made the birth of warfare possible was the emergence of societies with fully articulated social structures that provided stability and legitimacy to new social roles and behaviors. The scale of these fourth millennium urban societies was, in turn, a result of an efficient agricultural ability to produce adequate resources and large populations. It is no accident that the two earliest examples of these societies, Egypt and Sumer, were states where large-scale agricultural production was first achieved. The revolution in social structures that rested upon the new economic base was the most important factor responsible for the emergence of warfare. As important as these developments were, they coul d not have worked as they did without a profound change in the psychological basis of the people's social relationship with the larger community. The aggregation of large numbers of people into complex societies required that those living within them refoc us their allegiances away from the extended family, clan, and tribe, and toward a larger social entity, the state. This psychological change was facilitated by the rise of religious castes that gave meaning to the individual's life beyond a parochial conte xt. Organized belief systems were integrated into the social order and given institutional expression through public rituals that linked religious worship to political and military objectives that were national in scope and definition. Thus, the Egyptian pharaoh became divine, and military achievements of great leaders were perceived as divinely ordained or inspired. In this manner the power of religion was placed at the service of the state and its armies. Sumer is the birthplace of the first known civilization 1 (settled down city dwelling where people possess stable agriculture, domesticated animals, a hierarchical system of social classes with priest-kings, slaves, scribes, advisers, doctors, merchants, fishermen, smiths and masons), which flouris hed between 3500BC and 1900BC. The true Sumerian period begins sometime prior to 3500 BC, possibly as a primitive people stemming from hunters and gatherers who settled in the fertile-crescent. By the end of their occupation in Mesopotamia, they had created the beginnings of society, as we know it today."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 6 Eventually however, Sumer collapsed under the Amorites around 1900BC, who established many sub- kingdoms including Assyria and Babylon. The economy of Sumer was mainly based on agriculture, which eventual ly led to major technological advances in Mesopotamian history. A significant invention of the Sumerians was the wheel, which was first made of solid wood. Early homes in Sumer were huts made from bundles of reeds. Due to the shortage of stone, homes were eventually made of sun-baked mud brick s. Sumerians probably ploughed with stone and cut with clay sickles in the beginning, eventually using metal ploughs with the development of metalworking skill. The manufacturing of pottery and other products could hav e led to specialization and trading by barter. Sumerians had no money system except for the weighing of prec ious and semi -precious metals. Sumerians wrote on clay tablets and used a complicated script called cuneiform (wedge shaped). With a form of writing, Sumerians documented transactions and agreements of all kinds. The first people known to have developed a system of laws, Sumer influenced the law c odes of Eshnunna and Hammurabi. The technique of brewing beer was, in fact, an early technological achievement which presumably predates considerably the advent of the Sumerians in the lowlands of the Mesopotamian alluvial plane. Its invention has even been discussed as a possible motive for a much earlier, decisive step in the development of human culture, the so-called “Neolithic Rev olution.” It has been argued, that it was the discovery of the intoxicating effect of the alcohol contained in beer rather than the use of grain for other foodstuffs that caused the transition from hunting and gathering to living in stable settlements, domesticating animals, and culti vating the soil. This transition emerged around 7000 BC in the border territory of the alluvial plane of Mesopotamia. There is, however, no conclusive archaeological evidence for the invention of beer brewing technology as early as the beginning of the Neolithic period. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the emergence of agriculture was closely related to the processing of grain after the harvest, and that beer brewing soon belonged to the basic technologies of grain conservation and consumption. Ur was the capital of the Sumerian civilisation and once a great harbour city on the banks of the Euphrates river, until it changed its c ourse and the city became lost. The city was first excavated in 1853 and 1854 by British consul J. E. Taylor, who uncov ered the then sand-covered remains of the famed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 7 ziggurat of Ur which was dedicated to the moon god Nanna in Sumerian mythology and the Babylonian equivalent Sin in Babylonian mythology. However, the excavation of the actual city did not happen until 1918 w hen the British Museum funded an excavation under the leadership of British archaeologists Reginald C. Thompson and H. R. H. Hall. Though excavation ceased in 1919, it was restarted in 1922 in a joint expedition by the British Museum and the University Mus eum of the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley. Ending in 1934, this last expedition was the one that provided the most information on this mighty city of over 200 000 residents at its peak. In addition to excavating the ziggurat completely, the expedition unearthed the entire temple area at Ur and parts of the residential and commercial quarters of the city. The most spectacular discovery was that of the Royal Cemetery, dating from about 2600 BC and containing art treasures of gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones. The findings left little doubt that the deaths of the king and queen of Ur were followed by the voluntary death of their courtiers and personal attendants and of th e court soldier s and musicians. Within the city itself were discovered thousands of cuneiform tablets comprising administrative and literary documents dating from about 2700 to the 4th century BC. The deepest levels of the city contained traces of a flood, alleged to be the deluge of the great flood. Most of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. This city, which is mentioned several times in the Bible as Ur of the Chaldees (referring to the Chaldeans, whom settled in the area about 900 BC) as the birthplace of Prophet Abraham \"Ibrahim Al - Khalil\" (pbuh), was one of the most important cities of the Sumerians in the 4th and the 1st half of the 3rd millennium BC. It was also considered as one of the most active and full of life cities in southern"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 8 Mesopotamia during the following centuries. In former days it stood on the banks of the Euphrates, until the river changed its course. Evidence suggests that Ur had three classes of people. The richer, government officials, priests and soldiers, were at the top. The second level was for merchants, teachers, labourers, farmers and craft- makers. The bottom were for slaves captured in battle. Burials at Ur give insight into people's social standing. Kings and queens were buried with treasure as realised by Wooly's discovery of the 'Royal' burial site. Wealthy people were buried with less. Since irrigation gave Ur abundant crops, not everybody needed to work on farms. People learned other sk ills. Sir Leonard Wooly uncovered a tablet that listed Ur's special workers. The chisel workers made sculptures, the gem cutters made gems, and the fuller stomped on woven wools to make them soft. The metal workers made weapons. The period of interest f or the student of military histo ry is that from 3000 to 2316 BC ., the date that Sargon the Great united all of Sumer into a single state. This period was marked by almost constant wars among the major city states and against foreign enemies. Among the more common forei gn enemies of the southern city states were the Elamites, the peoples of northern Iran. The conflict between Sumerians and Elamites probably extended back to Neolithic times, but the first recorded instance of war between them appeared in 2700 BC ., when Mebaragesi, the first king on the Sumerian King List, undertook a war against the Elamites, and \"carried away as spoil the weapons of Elam.\" This first \"Iran- Iraq war\" was fought in the same area around Basra and the salt marshes that have witnessed the modern conflict between the same two states between 1980 and 1988. The almost constant o ccurrence of war among the city states of Sumer for two thousand years spurred the development of military technology and technique far beyond that found elsewhere at the time. The first war for which there is detailed evidence occurred between the states of Lagash and Umma in 2525 B.C. In this war Eannatum of Lagash defeated the king of Umma. The importance of this war to the military historian lies in a commemorative stele that Eannatum erected to celebrate his victory. It is called the Stele of Vultures for its portrayal of birds of pr ey and lions tearing at the corpses of the defeated dead as they lay on the desert plain. The stele represents the first important pictorial of war in the Sumerian period. The Stele of Vultures portrays the king of Lagash leading an infantry phalanx of arm ored, helmeted warriors, armed with spears, trampling their enemies. The king, with a socket axe, rides a chariot drawn by four onagers (wild asses.) In a lower panel, Eannatum holds a sickle-sword. The information and implications of this stele are pricel ess. "},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 9 The stele demonstrates that the Sumerian troops fought in phalanx formation, organized six files deep, with an eight-man front, somewhat similar to the formation used in Archaic Greece. Fighting in phalanx requires training and discipline, and the stele thus suggests that the men in this battle were professional soldiers. The typical neolithic army of men brought together to meet a temporary crisis found in Egypt throughout the Old Dynasty period had been clearly superseded in Sumer by the professional standing army. We know from the Tablets of Shuruppak (2600 B.C.) that even at this early date the kings of the city states provided for the maintenance of 600- 700 hundred soldiers on a full -time basis. This provision of military equipment for the soldi ers was a royal expense. Gone was the practice of each warrior fashioning his own equipment. The stele provides the first evidence in human history of a standing professional army. The first historical evidence of soldiers wearing helmets is also provided on the stele. From the bodies of soldiers found in the death pits of Ur dating from 2500 B.C., we know that these helmets were made of copper and probably had a leather liner or cap underneath. The appearance of the helmet marks the first defensive response to the killing power of an important offensive weapon, the mace, probably the oldest effective weapon of war. It was an extremely effective weapon against a soldier with no protection for the head. But i n Sumer, the presence of a well crafted helmet indicated a major development in military technology that was so effective that it drove the mace from the battlefield. The first military application of the wheel is depicted on the stele which shows Eannatum riding in a chariot. Interestingly, the Sumerians also invented the wheeled cart, which became the standard vehicle for logistical transport in the Middle East until the time of Alexander the Great. The Sumerian invention of the chariot ranks among the major military innovations in history. The Sumerian chariot was usually a four -wheeled vehicle (although there are examples of the two-wheeled variety in other records) and required four onagers to pull it. The Sumerians are also credited with inventing the rein ring for use with the chariot in order to give the driver some control over the onagers . At this early stage of development the chariot probably was not a major offensive weapon because of its size, weight, and instability. In all probability it was not produced in quantity. Later, however, in the hands of the Hyksos, Hittites, Cannanites, Egyptians, and Assyrians, the chariot became the primary striking vehicle of the later Bronze and early Iron Age armies. Chariot drivers, archers, and spearmen became the elite fighting corps of the ancient world. In some countries of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 10 the area, the tradition continues to this day. It is not accidental that the Israeli army named its first tank the Merkava . In Hebrew, Merkava means chariot. The lower palette of the Stele of Vultures shows the king holding a si ckle -sword. The sickle-sword became the primary infantry weapon of the Egyptian and Biblical armies at a much later date. When the Bible speaks of peoples being \"smoted,\" the reference is precisely to the sickle- sword. The fact that the sickle -sword appear s on two independent renderings of the same period suggests strongly that the Sumerians invented this important weapon sometime around 2500 B.C. The stele shows Eannatum's soldiers wearing what appears to be armored cloaks . Each cloak was secured around the neck and was made either of cloth or, more probably, thin leather. Metal disks with raised centers or spines like the boss on a shield were sown on the cloak. Although somewhat primitive in application, the cloak was the first representation of body armor, and would have afforded relatively good protection against the weapons of the day. Later, of course, the Sumerians introduced the use of overlapping plate body armor Other ancient Sumerian archaeological sources portray additional examples of important military innovations. A carved conch plate shows the king of Ur armed with a socket axe. The development of the bronze socket axe remains one of Sumer's major military innovations, one that conferred a significant militar y advantage. Ancient axe makers had difficulty in affixing the axe blade to the shaft with sufficient strength so as to allow it to remain attached when striking a heavy blow. The use of the cast bronze socket, which slipped over the head of the shaft and could be secured with rivets, allowed a much stronger attachment of the blade to the shaft. It is likely that the need for a stronger axe arose in response to the development of some type of body armor that made the cutting axe less effective as a killing instrument. Further, Sumerian axes by 2500 B.C. clearly show a change in design. The most significant change was a narrowing of the blade so as to reduce the impact area and bring the blade to more of a point. The development marks the beginning of the penetrating axe, whose narrow blade and strong socket made it capable of piercing bronze plate armor. The result was the introduction of one of the most devastating weapons of the ancient world, a weapon that remained in use for two thousand years. The military technology of the ancient world did not, as in modern times, develop independent of need. There were, after all, no research and development establishments to invent new weapons. In the ancient world military technology arose in response to perceived practical needs arising from battlefield experience. And in Sumer, two thous and years of war among the city states provided the opportunity for constant military innovation. In other countries, such as Egypt, that were sealed off from major enemies by geogr aphy and culture, there was little need to change military technologies. The weapons of Egypt, as a result, remained far behind developments in Sumer because they were adequate to the task at hand. There was no need to develop body armor, the helmet, or the penetrating axe when one's enemies did not possess this technology. But sophisticated weaponry and tactics required some form of larger social organization to give them impetus and direction. We know very little about the military organization of Sumer in the third millennium. We can judge from the Tablets of Shuruppak (2600 B.C.) that the typical city state comprised about 1800 square miles, including all its fields and lands. This area could sustain a population of between thirty and thirty five thousand people. The tablets record a force of between 600-700 hundred soldiers serving as the king's bodyguard, the corps of the professional army. But a population of this size could easily support an army of regular and reserve forces numbering between four and five thousand men at full mobilization. Surely some form of conscription must have existed since theirs was a common tradition of corve'e labor to maintain the dikes and temples. Yet the military confrontations of the time may not have required very lar ge armies. Conscript troops would not usually be capable of the training and discipline required of an"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 11 infantry phalanx. If they were used, they were likely armed with some other weapons, like the sickle- sword or the bow, whose application could be taught to an average conscript or reservist in a few days. One fact contributing strongly to the possibility of some sort of military organization was that by 2400 B.C. the Sumerian kings had largely abandoned their religious functions to the priesthoods while increasing their civil functions and control. The kings became the undisputed controllers of civic resources. Moreover, it is simply not reasonable to expect that a people who could organize themselves to tame the Tigris and Euphrates with an elaborate system of dikes, canals, and bridges and who could sustain a sophisticated system of irrigation would, at the same time, have simply left to chance the organization of their military arm, among the most important roles of the king. The period following Eannatum's death was characterized by more war, a situation that led to a relatively even development of weapons technology throughout the city states of Sumer. Two hundred years after Eannatum, King Lugalzagesi of Umma succeeded in establishing his influence over all of Sumer, although there is no evidence that he introduced any significant changes. Twenty -four years later, the empire of Lugalzagesi was destroyed by the forces of a Semitic prince from the northern city of Akkad, Sargon the Great. By force of arms he conquered all the Sumerian states, the entire Tigris -Euphrates basin, and brought into being an empire that stretched from the Taurus Mountains to the Persian Gulf. Sargon united both halves of Mesopotamia for the first time since 4000 B.C. As with most early Sumerian kings, we know little about Sargon the Great. Cuneiform records indicate that in his 50-year reign he fought no fewer than 34 wars. One account suggests that his core military force numbered 5,400 men; if that account is accurate, then Sargon's standing army at full mobilization would have constituted the largest army of the time by far. Even for this time a standing army of this size is not as outrageous as it may seem. Unlike leaders of the previ ous wars between the rival city sta tes, Sargon created a national empire and would have required a much larger force than usual to sustain it, as he and his heirs did for 300 years. In this sense, Sargon faced the same problem as Alexander . Like Alexander, once the city states were brought to heel, Sargon would have required them to place at his disposal some of their military forces. As we have noted, each of the fourteen major city states could have sustained an army of between four and five thousand men, not counting the small states that would also have been forced to contribute. Yet"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 12 another source of military manpower would have been available from the conquered non-Sumerian provi nces. It was common practice through Greek and Roman times to enlist soldiers of the conquered into the imperial armies of the time. The armies of imperial Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Rome all had large contingents of former enemies within their ranks. That Sargon's army would have been comprised of professionals seems obvious in light of the constant state of war that characterized his reign. Even if they had begun as conscripts, within a short time Sargon's soldiers would have become battle-hardened veterans. Equipping an army of this size would have necessitated a high degree of military organization to run the weapons and logistics functions, to say nothing of routine administration likely attendant to a people who, by Sargon's time, had been keeping wr itten records for more than a millennium. During the Sargonid period, the Summerians/Akkadians contributed yet another major innovation in weaponry, the composite bow. The innovation may have come during the reign of Naram Sin (2254- 2218), Sargon's grands on. Like his grandfather, Naram Sin fought continuous wars of suppression and conquest. His victory over the Lullubi is commemorated in a rock sculpture that shows Naram Sin armed with a composite bow. This rendering marks the first appearance of the composite bow in history and strongly suggests it was of Sumerian/Akkadian origin. This bow was a major military innovation. While the simple bow could kill at ranges from 50-100 yards, it would not penetrate even simple armor at these ranges. The composite bow, with a pull of 2- 3 times that of the simple bow, would easily have penetrated leather armor, and perhaps even the early prototypes of bronze armor that were emerging at this time. Even in the hands of untrained conscript archers, the composite bow cou ld bring the enemy under a hail of arrows from twice the distance as the simple bow. So important was this new weapon that it became a basic implement of war in all armies of the region for the next fifteen hundred years. The armies of Sumer and Akkad represented the pinnacle of military development in the Bronze Age. No army of the same period could match the Sumerians in military effectiveness and weaponry. The Sumerian civilization produced no fewer than six major new weapons and defensive systems, all of which set the standard for other armies of the Bronze Age and Iron Ages. Few armies in history have been so innovative. The armies of Egypt, on the other hand, although already a thousand years old by the time of Sargon, were technologically inferior to the Sumerians and would remain so until, in a remarkable example of technological transfer, the Egyptians themselves obtained the weapons of the Sumerians and used them to forge the world's next great military empire.

CLAY TABLETS – THE EVIDENCE OF SUMERIAN KNOWLEDGE The Sumer ian civilization existed for 3000 years, between the fifth and the second millennium BC. They reached their golden era 3000-2000 BC. The Sumerians invented the wheel, the plough, irrigation, sailing boats, the keel, potter’s wheel and were the first to build stone arcs and multi -storeys buildings. They had an advanced juridical system, developed mathematics, astronomy and the calendar. Still today our definition of time is based on the original Sumerian number -system based on 6 and 60, and the division of the circle in 360 degrees. But their most important invention, the very basis of all later civilizations and cultures was done late in the 4th century BC: – the art of writing. Cuneiform script is one of the earliest known fo rms of written expression. E merging in Sumer around the 3000           century BC, with predecessors reaching into the late 4th millennium (the Uruk IV period), cuneiform writing began as a system of pictographs. In the three millennia the script spanned, the pictor ial representations became simplified and more abstract as the number of characters in use also grew gradually smaller, from about 1,000 unique characters in the Early Bronze Age to about 400 unique characters in Late Bronze Age (Hittite cuneiform). The original Sumerian script was adapted for the writing of the Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, and Urartian languages, and it inspired the Ugaritic and Old Persian alphabets. Cuneiform writing was gradually replaced by the Phoenician alphabet during the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and by the 2nd century AD, the script had become extinct. Cuneiform documents were written on clay tablets, by means of a blunt reed for a stylus. The impressions left by the stylus were wedge shaped, thus giving rise to the name cuneiform (\"wedge shaped\", from the Latin cuneus, meaning \"wedge\"). The significant finding of Sumerian clay tablets which lay buried for thousands of years began in the nineteenth century with Austen Henry Layard in Paris, France . Layard belonged to a family of doctors, bankers and diplomats, and was educated in the top schools of England, France, Italy and Switzerland. He loved the study of languages and fine arts, and served as a lawyer -apprentice for six years. Upon entering hi s 20’s, Layard was totally groomed for aristocratic success. In 1839, Layard determined to follow in his father’s footsteps and return to Ceylon (present- day Sri Lanka) to serve in the British civil service. Layard’s family had served as diplomats in Ceylon for generations. However, rather than travel by standard aristocratic means, Layard decided to walk from England to Ceylon by way of Asia. He was 22. Once he embarked on his trek, Layard’s life journey took a totally different track. He never made it to Ceylon. Instead, he spent years wandering about Persia and Turkey, fascinated by the local cultures and ancient Assyrian ruins. Ultimately, he was responsible for rediscovering the ancient ruins of Nineveh in 1847, including the lost palace of Sennacherib. He also stumbled into the famous library of Ashurbanipal, which contained 22,000 clay texts, including important finds such as the Epic of Gilgamesh. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 14 In Mesopotamian mythology, Gilgamesh is a giant (the result of human and extra-terrestrial breeding) of superhuman strength who built the city walls of Uruk to defend his people from external threats, and travelled to meet the sage Utnapishtim, who had su rvived the Great Deluge. Many associate Utnapishitim with the person of Noah in the Bible since Utnapishitim was given orders from the gods to build a wooden ark to escape the coming deluge. The ancient accounts of Gilgamesh and other events of the first B abylonian Empire were presumed destroyed in the fiery fall of Nineveh in 612 BC. However, it was Sir Austen Henry Layard that discovered that thousands of years of history were actually preserved under the desert sands, from the cuneiform records of Gilgam esh to the huge walls and relief sculptures of Sennacherib's throne room. Beyond the tablets of Gilgamesh, which would be studied and deciphered at the British Museum for years, Layard discovered a very important cuneiform inscription on a massive doorway . This stunning discovery turned out to be Sennacherib's own account of his siege of Jerusalem. Why was this stunning? The mid-19th century was a time of religious scepticism and biblical revisionism in Europe. Now, the world had new and compelling evidenc e for an important biblical event. Layard’s journeys and exploits continued throughout his life, including more tablets in the line of Gilgamesh and more biblical discoveries from the ancient Assyrian period. In 1866, Sir Austen Henry Layard became a trus tee of the British Museum, where he published a number of books and articles about his phenomenal adventures into the past. By 1850, Europe had scores of inscriptions coming largely from Assyrian sites, made in the very same script and language as the thi rd version of the Persepolis and Behistun inscriptions. The decipherment of this language was simplified on the one hand by the fact that it was recognized quite early in the process that it belonged to the Semitic group of languages. On the other hand, it was complicated by the fact that the orthography, as was soon recognized, was syllabic and ideographic rather than alphabetic. The leading figure in the decipherment of Accadian, or Assyrian as it was then designated, was the Irish scholar Edward Hincks and Henry Rawlinson. Henry Rawlinson, a British army officer, found some of the Behistun inscriptions on a cliff at Behistun in Persia. Carved in the reign of King Darius of Persia (522 BC -486 BC), they consisted of identical texts in the three official languages of the empire: Old Persian, Babylonian, and Elamite. The Behistun inscription was to the decipherment of cuneiform w hat the Rosetta Stone was to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Rawlin son correctly deduced that the old Persian was a syllabic script and he successfully deciphered it. Working independently of him, the Irish Assyriologist Edward Hincks , also contributed to the decipherment. After translating the Persian, Rawlinson and Hincks began to decipher the others. They were greatly helped by the discovery of the city of Nineveh. Among the treasures uncovered at Nineveh"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 15 were the remains of the great library of Assurbanipal, a royal archive containing tens of thousands of baked clay tablets covered with cuneiform inscriptions. By 1851, Hincks and Rawlinson could read 200 Babylonian signs. They were soon joined by two other decipherers: a young German-born scholar called Julius Oppert, and the versatile British Orientalist William Henry Fox Talbot. Edwin Norris, the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, gave each of them a copy of a recently discovered inscription from the reign of the Assyrian emperor Tiglath- Pileser I. A jury of experts was empanelled to examine the resulting translat ions and assess their accuracy. In all essential points the translations produced by the four scholars were found to be in close agreement with one another. There were of course some slight discrepancies. The inexperienced Talbot had made a number of mistakes, and Oppert's translation contained a few doubtful passages due to his unfamiliarity with the English language. But Hincks' and Rawlinson's versions were virtually identical. The jury declared itself satisfied, and the decipherment of Akkadian cuneiform was adjudged a fait accompli. As for the second, or Elamite version, of the Behistun inscription, it offered relatively little difficulty as soon as progress was made in the decipherment of Accadian, since it uses a syllabary based on the Accadian system of writing. The major figures in its decipherment were Westergaard and Norris. As early as 1855 Norris, the secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society, published the complete text of the second version of the Behistun inscription, which had been copied by Rawlinson, together with a transliteration and a translation; this remained practically the standard work on the subject until Weissbach published his Achämenideninschriften zweiter Art in 1896. For several decades following the discov ery of the existence of Sumeria, prac tically all the source material for its decipherment and study consisted of the bilinguals and syllabaries from the so-called Ashurbanipal library which was discovered and excavated at Nineveh. This material dates from the seventh century B. C., some fifteen hundred years after the disappearance of Sumer as a political entity. As for the material from the Sumerian sites, it consisted almost entirely of a very small group of bricks, tablets, and cylinders from the Sumerian and post-Sumerian periods which had found their way into the British Museum. In 1877, however, began the first successful excavation at a Sumerian site. In that year, the French under De Sarzec began to excavate at Telloh the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash, an excavation which has been conducted by French archaeologists intermittently and with long interruptions almost to the present day. It was at this site that the first important Sumerian monuments were excavated, the objects and inscriptions of the ishakkus or princes of Lagash. Here , more than one hundred thousand tablets and fragments were dug up, dating from the pre -Sargonid and Ur III periods. The second major excavation on a Sumerian site was that conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, the first American expedition to excavate in Mesopotamia. All through the eighties of the nineteenth century discussions had been going on in American university circles pertaining to the feasibility of sending an American expedition to Iraq, where both British and French had been making extraordinary finds. It was not until 1887, however, that John P. Peters, professor of Hebrew in the University of Pennsylvania, succeeded in obtaining moral and financial support from various individuals in and about the university, for the purpose of equipping and maintaining an excavating expedition in Iraq under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. Nippur, one of the largest and most important mounds in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 16 Iraq, was chosen, and four long and extremely difficult excavating campaigns were conducted during the years 188990, 1890-91, 1893-96, and 1896-1900. The hardships and handicaps were severe and discouraging. One young archaeologist died in the field, and there was hardly a year in which one or the other of the members of the expedition did not suffer from serious illness. Difficulties with the Arab tribes were not infrequent and at times assumed a most threatening character. In spite of the obstacles, however, the excavating continued, and in the course of the four campaigns which lasted more than a dec ade, the expedition achieved magnificent and in some respects unparalleled results, at least in the inscriptional field. The Nippur expedition succeeded in excavating approximately thirty thousand tablets and fragments in the course of its four campaigns, the larger part of which are inscribed in the Sumerian language and date from the second half of the third millennium to the first half of the second millennium B. C. However by far the most significant material for the study of Sumerian culture, especiall y in its more spiritual aspects, consists of a group of \"literary\" tablets dated about 1750 B.C. which are inscribed with Sumerian epics and myths, hymns and lamentations, proverbs and \"words of wisdom.\" And it is important to note that, in spite of the vast quantity of Sumerian inscriptional material excavated to date, onl y some three thousand tablets and fragments, no more than one percent, are inscribed with Sumerian literary compositions. Of these three thousand pieces, approximately nine hundred are di stributed as follows. • Some three hundred very small fragments have been found in Kish by the French and were published by De Genouillac in 1924. • Approximately two hundred tablets and fragments were bought by the Berlin Museum from dealers; these were published by Zimmern in 1912-13. • Approximately one hundred were acquired by the Louvre from dealers; these were published by De Genouillac in 1930. • Less than a hundred pieces have found their way to the British Museum and the Ashmolean Museum; these have been published in the course of several decades by King, Langdon, and Gadd. To these must be added an uncertain number (two hundred?) excavated in Ur which are to be published by Gadd of the Briti sh Museum in the near future. • The remaining two thousand and one hundred tablets and fragments, by far the major part of our Sumerian literary tablets, were excavated by the University of Pennsylvania at Nippur some fifty years ago. Of this number, over one hundred have found their way to the University of Jena in Germany; approximately eight hundred are in the possession of the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul; almost eleven hundred are located in the University Museum at Philadelphia. It is no exaggeration to state, therefore, that it is the Nippur expedition of the University of Pennsylvania which is to be credited in large part with the recovery and restoration of the ancient Sumerian literary comp ositions as written down at approximately 1750 B.C. It is well worth noting that these Sumerian literary creations are significant not only for their remarkable form and illuminating contents. They are unique, too, in that they have come down to us as actually written by the scribes of four thousand years ago, unmodified and uncodified by later redactors with axes to grind and ideologies to satisfy. Our Sumerian literary compositions thus represent the oldest literature of any appreciable and significant am ount ever uncovered.

THE ANUNNAKI ACCORDING TO ZECARIAH SITCHIN Ancient records and cultures talk of 'Gods' or deities that have arrived on Earth from the Heavens, then proceeding to create (or genetically engineer) of what we now know as 'man'. For instance, • Japanese emperors claim decent from dragon gods who came from the sky. • Australian Aborigines teach of a reptilian race which lives underneath the Earth and governs over men. They believe that they are descended from a race of dragon humans. • China teaches the Serpent Queen Nukua interbred with men. • India calls these reptilian gods Nagas, claiming that they seeded their royal families. • Throughout the Middle East it is believed that a Serpent race created man. • Africa has the Chitari, children of the Serpent, from which the Royal Kings claim decent. • The Book of Genesis in the Bible gives us giants who came from the heavens to breed with daughters of men, calling them Nephilim. • South American Mayans teach that their ancestors were the people of the Serpent. • Aztec Quetzalcoatl was a benefactor, considered a leader among the deities. The name is a combination of quetzal a brightly colored American bird, and coatl, meaning serpent. • Hopi Indians believe that sky gods came to Earth to breed with their women and refer to them as their Snake Brothers, Sioux means snakes and Iroquois means serpents. • Mexico has the Nagal, a serpent god. • In S umeria they used the term “Anunnaki” to describe the gods who came from the sky The recorded historical documentation for the existence and deeds of the Anunnaki has become gradually available to us only since the early 1800’s. The excavation of the ancient sites of Mesopotamia brought to light the amazingly advanced civilization of Sumer and, with it, thousands of clay tablets containing not only mundane records of commerce, marriages, military actions and advanced astronomical calculation systems but of the history of the Anunnaki themselves. It is clear from those records that the Sumerians knew these beings to be real and tangible. The library of the ruler, Ashurbanipal, at Nineveh was discovered to have burnt down and the clay tablets held there were fired, preserving them for our reading. One of the most impressive finds, in very recent time, has been a sealed, nine foot by six foot room in Sippar holding, neatly arranged on shelves, a set of some 400 elaborate clay tablets containing an unbroken record of the history of those ancient times, a sort of time capsule. These tablets tell of the race of extra -terrestrial Gods called the AN.UNNAK.KI (Those Who From Heaven To Earth Came). Sumer was called KI.EN.GIR in the tablets which literally translates to 'Land of the Lord of The Blazing Rockets'. The Sumerian records recorded in great detail the stories of the Anunnaki, and among thes e, that of the main protagonists; Enki, Enlil, Ninki, Inanna, Utu, Ningishzida, Marduk, as well as many others. Chief among these stories was the continuing conflict between Enki and Enlil, the sons of the supreme god of the time, Anu. But the Anunnaki wer e more than just a pai r of squabbling half-brothers. They were the council of Gods and Goddesses, who periodically met to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 18 consider their future actions with respect to each other, and probably as a smaller, nondescript item on thei r agenda, the fate of mankind. For the Sumerians it was a religion of polytheism. Whilst there may be some disagreement on the identity of the S umerian Anunnaki, one viewpoint seems to be generally accepted by many people of many disciplines: The Anunnaki were wor shipped as gods by the Sumerians . Laurence Gardner, author of “Bloodline of the Holy Grail” and “The Shadow of Solomon” writes “Every item of written and pictorial attestation confirms that the ancient Sumerians were absolutely sincere about the existence of the Anunnaki, and those such as Enki, Enlil, Nin- khursag and Inanna fulfilled earthly functions wit h designated community duties. They were patrons and founders; they were teachers and justices; they were technologists and kingmakers. They were jointly and severally venerated as archons and masters, but there were certainly not idols of religious worship as the ritualistic gods of subsequent cultures became. In fact, the word which was eventually translated to become ‘worship’ was avod, whi ch meant quite simply, ‘work’. The Anunnaki presence may baffle historians, their language may confuse linguists and their advanced techniques may bewilder scientists, b ut to dismiss them is foolish. The Sumerians have themselves told us precisely who the Anunnaki were, and neither hist ory nor science can prove otherwise.” 2 Another famous author in regards to the Sumerians and the Anunnaki is the late Zecharia Sitchin who died in October 2010. He was born in Russia and raised in Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of moder n and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. The theories and interpretations of Sumerian culture entered the mainstream mainly via the works of Sitchin Both Zecharia Stichin and Laurence Gardner believe that the Anunnaki, depending upon the context, are the same as the Nephilim , the gods that Abraham’s father, Terah, (according to the book of Joshua) was reputed to have served, the fallen angels, the lesser individuals of the race from which Anu, Enki, Enlil, Inanna and the other notables had sprung, and the “judges” over the question of life and death. According to Sitchin, the race of advanced extra-terrestrial beings called the Anunnaki (\"Those Who From Heaven to Earth Came\") is responsible for mankind's genesis. According to Sitchin’s interpretation"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 19 of the Sumerian clay tablets, the Anunnaki came from a planet called Nibiru (\"The Planet of the Crossing\"), which lies beyond Pluto in our solar system and which passes near Earth every 3,600 years. About 4 billion years ago, Nibiru's orbit brought it catastrophically close to another planet, Tiamat, which resided between Mars and Jupiter. Gravitational pressures from Nibiru's orbit tore Tiamat apart, forming the asteroid belt that now lies beyond Mars. Additionally, a large fragment of the doomed planet was hurled closer to the sun, and over time this piece of debris evolved into a planet in its own right: Earth. About 450,000 years ago, during one of Nibiru' s close passes of Earth, the Anunnaki began exploring and colonizing the relatively new planet, using the Mesopotamian region as their base camp. The spacefaring beings, which many researchers believe are reptilian in nature, were attracted to Earth's enor mous mineral reserves, particularly gold. Many theories have been put forth to explain their need for gold, one of which suggests that gold could have been used to repair Nibiru's upper atmosphere, which would have been damaged after the near - collision with Tiamat. Modern scientists agree that gold particles released into the atmosphere could actually repair Earth's ozone layer; perhaps this scenario applied to Nibiru as well. Another reason for the Anunnaki 's need for gold could have been the curious neurological effects that are caused by ingestion of monoatomic gold, a molecularly refined derivative of raw gold. According to researchers like Brian Desborough and David Icke, monoatomic gold can exponentially increase the processing speed and capacity of the brain and central nervous system, giving a sentient being extraordinary mental and physiological powers, including the ability to process information rapidly like a computer and the ability to shape-shift into another form. Earth contained a great deal of gold, especially in Africa, and the Anunnaki at first used their own lower classes to mine the mineral. These lower classes of gods were still more powerful than humans and wer e called “Igigi” or “those who watch and see”. The epic of Atrahasis is an epic composed around 1700 BC which hardly receives attention yet provide significant insight into the relationship between the Anunnaki and the Igigi. In this epic the gods are divi ded into two classes. The labour on the fields was carried out by the 300 Igigi on behalf of the 600 more important gods, the leaders, called the Anunnaki . According to the epic of Atrahasis the Igigi grew disenchanted with the hard labor and mutinied with a"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 20 protest to their chief employer, Enil. Because no work on the fields would result in famine, Enil informs Anu who calls a council of the gods to resolve the issue. During the counsel, Enki puts forward the idea to create a different species whose responsibility would be to work on the fields and serve th e gods. Seeing that a primitive humanoid species dominated Africa, the key mining region for the Anunnaki , Enki decided that a hybrid between these lowly creatures and the Anunnaki would make a suitable s lave: intelligent enough to handle a limited number of chores but still as controllable as any beast of burden. After a great deal of trial and error, the Anunnaki created homo sapiens about 300,000 years ago and allowed the new beings to form the first modern human society, Sumeria. Then, about 12,000 years ago, the imminent return of Nibiru threatened to wipe out the new slaves and bring disaster to Earth in the form of massive tidal waves and climate changes brought on by the proximity of the two wor lds. In an effort to preserve his engineered slave race and other creatures of Earth, Enki instructed a Sumerian named Utnapishtim to collect the seed of Earth's living beings and preserve them in a boat designed to withstand the coming flood. While the An unnaki retreated to ships in orbit around Earth, the surface of the planet was devastated. Eventually humanity survived and began to thrive. More and more human cities sprang up, each of them ruled by leaders chosen by the Anunnaki based on the purity of their genetic make-up. More of an Anunnaki genetic strain in a person's blood meant the person was more 'kingly,' and thus was born the concept of the divine right of kings, which continues to this day in many countries and in many guises. According to Davi d Icke, author of the controversial “The Biggest Secret”, although we have the illusion that we control Earth and the destinies of its nations, it is only an illusion. Icke and others such as Sitchin and Gardner believe that the A nun naki created us and control us to this very day, and their control has evolved from the overt to the covert. According to Icke, It would be unwieldy ev en for advanced aliens to keep six billion people in brutal, obvi ous slavery, so over time the A nun naki have allowed humans to believe in their independence while secretly controlling events behind the scenes through governments, religions, secret societies and world banking systems. In most world governments, the most powerful people tend to be members of elite, influential families, and these families in turn are usually associated with influential secret cabals like the Freemasons and Skull and Bones. These shadowy groups trace their ancestry back through time to ancient mystery schools that knew the truth about mankind's dark origins. In order to better control the ignorant masses, Icke believes that subservience-based religions like Christianity and Islam were manufactured using heavily censored or distorted accounts adapted from the original Sumerian histori es (we address later) . Though we no longer mine gold in the heart of Africa, David Icke suggests that we are still controlled by our sinister otherworldly masters and serve their other as - yet -unknown agendas."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 21 There is a great deal of admittedly circumstantial evidence to support the notion of an alien genesis of mankind. Chief among this evidence is the testimony of the Sumerian texts themselves. These ancient tablets contain much of the raw material contained in the first few books of the Old Testament, s uch as the Utnapishtim/Noah story. Many such as Gardner, Icke and Sitchin believed that those who accept the literal or figurative truth of the Bible, should also accept the Sumerian texts as even 'truer,' since they believe these texts form the Bible's source material. As we will see later such reasoning misses a very important point regarding the validity and credibility of the Bible. There is still ongoing debate as to whether or not all of Sitchin’s theories about the Anunnaki are accurate but Sitchins interpretations of the Sumerian clay tablets was given a significant boost by by Samuel Noah Kramer one of the foremost academic translators of ancient languages. According to Kramer: “The ancient literatures which have exercised the most profoun d influence on the more spiritual aspects of our civilization...the Bible, which contains the literary creations of the Hebrews; the Iliad and Odyssey, which are filled with the epic and mythic lore of the Greeks; the Rig -veda, which contains the literary pr oducts of ancient India; and the Avesta, which contains those of ancient Iran. None of these literary collections were written down in their present form before the first half of the first millennium B.C. Our Sumerian literature, inscribed on tablets datin g from approximately 2000 B. C., therefore antedates these literatures by more than a millennium. Moreover, there is another vital difference. The texts of the Bible, of the Iliad and Odyssey, and of the Rig- veda and Avesta, as we have them, have been modi fied, edited, and redacted by compilers and redactors with varied motives and diverse points of view. Not so our Sumerian literature; it has come down to us as actually inscribed by the ancient scribes of four thousand years ago, unmodified and uncodified by l ater compilers and commentators” 3 "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 22 4. THE ANUNNAKI ACCORDING TO MAXIMILLIEN DELAYFAYETTE Maximillien de Lafayette is an author of fifty years responsible for over 1,200 b ooks and numerous encyclopaedias in which 857 books and 9 encyclopaedias are published. He is considered by many to be the world leading authority on the Anunnaki and is considered as one of the world leading linguists (Ancient Languages) and historians of ancient civilizations. In addition, he has written 14 dictionaries of various languages, to name a few: Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyr ian, Aramaic, Latin, French, Hittite, Phoenician, Ugaritic, Greek, etc. He is an expert linguist in 26 languages (Ancient and modern). In 2004, as an expert linguis t and jurist, Maximillien de Lafayette was commissioned by Yale University, School of Law (New Haven, Connecticut) to translate from English to Arabic, The White House Draft of the New Constitution of Iraq, and which was submitted to the Iraqi Council, then the governing body of Iraq. De Lafayette is internationally known for his expertise in the history and languages of ancient civilizations, and social -legal studies of the Near East and the Middle East, with a strong emphasis on tribal dialects, comparati ve social systems and laws, and Islam. Below is a historical overview from de Lafayette of the Anunnaki based on his research and understanding of the ancient clay tablets and what the Sumerians passed down regarding their understanding of the sky gods whom they served. 4 1,250.000 years ago: The Anunnaki are not the oldest extra - terrestrial race, because we don’t know at all how many different extra -terrestrial races and inhabitable planets and stars exist in the known and unknown universe. However, we do know from the Book of Ramadosh (Rama- Dosh) and other obscure but reliable sources, that the Anunnaki are the early galactic race (From outer space) to land on planets Mars and Earth, and to established colonies in different regions of our planet, encomp assing the lands of Central Africa, Madagascar, Australia, a region of Europe, with a strong concentration in ancient Phoenicia and Iraq. The early edition of the book of Ramadosh (Rama- Dosh) also refers to the Anunnaki’s primordial colonies and their spat ial stations on Mars, before their arrival to planet Earth. In one of the Fousool (Chapters) of the Book, the scribes explained the reason and motives of the Anunnaki’s expedition to Earth. In a sharp contrast with a common belief, the Anunnaki did not lan d on Earth to mine gold. This theory was ridiculed by some Honorable Ulema. According to the Ulema, the Anunnaki landed on Earth in order to: 1-Use our planet as bio -aquatic research center, 2-Extract and collect Earth’s valuable resources, 3-Conduct genetic experiments. Note: The extra -terrestrial bio -aquatic research center theory surfaced in United States government secret files shared with NSA and NASA. In these files, references were made to currently existing non- terrestrial facilities, habitats, bases, laboratories, and “strange” communities under water on planet Earth; all in the hands of an extra- terrestrial race. Also note that Lafayette goes against Sitchin who says the primary reason for them coming to earth was to mine for gold. 450,000- 460,000 B.C: Anunnaki’s first landing in Phoenicia: The Anunnaki landed in the fields and on the shores of what we call today Lebanon. The word “Lebanon” is an Anunnaki’s adjective meaning “white”. Egyptians began to use it in the third Millennium before Christ, and references were made to Lebanon in manifestos and letters pertaining to cedar wood shipments from Lebanese cities to Egypt. The Greeks called the lands “Phoenicia”. It is derived from the Greek word “Phoenix”, meaning purple- red. And purple red was the dye (Ourjouwan) extracted by"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 23 the Phoenicians from the mollusk shell -fis h. It was used to color linens and fabrics. Purple -red was the royal color of the Anakh (Anunnaki.) The Anunnaki began to build their first colonies on Earth. They established the cities of Saydoon (became Sidon and Saida) , Tyrahk (Tyre and Sour) , Kadmosh (The Phoenician “Kadmos” ) is named after Kadmosh; , Adonakh (The Phoenician god “Adon” is named after Adonakh. Adon or Adoon became Adoni and Adonai in Hebrew) Ilayshlim, Markadash. The Sea Castle at Sidon was built and used by the Crusaders for multiple purposes known to historians. But the esoteric history of Sidon told us, that many of the Crusaders fortresses and castles have served as secret centers for Near Eastern esoterica, the occult and the study of Sihr. Sidon was one of the earliest colonies of the Anunnaki on Earth. 449,000 B.C.: Under the leadership of Enki, the Anunnaki landed on Earth. The Anunnaki established their first colonies on the lands of Phoenicia, Syria and Iraq. But their first citi es and housing facilities were erected near Baalbeck, followed by Eridu. The Anunnaki used a sort of laser beams (anti -gravity tools) to lift and transport enormous stones exceeding 1,500 tones each to build their first labs, landing and launching pads and to strengthen their strongholds. Their operations extended to regions neighboring Iran, Jordan and Israel. Years later, they concentrated their operations in Sumer and Africa, where they built enormous cities. However, during their first expedition, the A nunnaki did not relinquish the colonies they established in Phoenicia (Baalbeck and Tyre). The first Anunnaki’s expedition included a multitude of scientists, land and space topographers, irrigation experts, engineers, architects, metallurgists, mineralogi sts, and military men. Baalbeck was the original space mission center of the Anunnaki. Today, a launching pad for extra- terrestrial spaceships is still visible at Baalbeck nearby the Temple of Jupiter. Later on in history, Baalbeck became a major occult and a healing center visited by many kings and emperors. Attracted by its beauty and supernatural properties, the Roman emperor Augustus made Baalbeck a Roman colony and a major oracles shrine. In fact, the Roman emperor Trajan consulted a celebrated oracle in Baalbeck. Unfortunately, Baalbeck was totally sacked and decimated by the Muslim Arabs in 748 A.D. In 1,400 A.D., the Muslim Turkish conqueror Tamerlane pillaged and destroyed the city, and several Roman- Phoenician -Anunnaki temples and altars. In 1,759 A.D., a major earthquake decimated the remaining ruins and almost all what was left from the Anunnaki - Phoenician monuments. There is one place on earth, the Ulema consider as the ultimate “terminal” of the Anunnaki; a sort of a Ba’ab from which a person enters or exits a physical dimension. And that place is Baalbeck. Thousands of years ago, and long before the Sumerians established their kingdom in Iraq, and interacted with the Anunnaki, and many many centuries before the human race in any region of the w orld learned about God or Gods, the Anunnaki landed in Baalbeck, and revealed to its inhabitants many secrets, including teleportation, psychic healings, and the divine nature of the supreme beings (Gods, creators). Baalbeck served them as a landing and a launching post. It still exists today.

This time, the Anunnaki brought with them, physicians, and geneticists. Their intention was clear: In order to successfully conducting their gold mining operations on a larger scale, the Anunnaki decided the create beings capable of carrying and executing hard labor and continuous physical work. Thus, they began to work on a creation formula using in part their own DNA, blood and other substances extracted from Earth. Their creation of the human race went through several primordial phases: Phase 1: The Anunnaki tried to improve on a previous creation of a quasi -human form created by the Igigi. Phase 2: The Anunnaki worked on 7 different human forms (world’s first half -human- half -animal species.) Their efforts remained fruitless because these creatures were not equipped with a developed mind, thus communicating with them, and/or explaining to them their duties and tasks was an impossible maneuver. The Igigi created an inferior race of “working creatures” because the Igigi were not good geneticists. They were experts in weaponry, mineralogy and metallurgy. Phase 3: Ninhursag, half -sister of Enki, and the Anunnaki expert in medicine and genetics developed a “creation formula” combining Anunnaki’s DNA and terrestrial elements which resulted in the “production” of a human race. But this early human race did not meet the expectations of Ninhursag. Although the physical form was improved and the mobility of the body was enormously ameliorated, this newly created race was not intelligent enough to follow the instructions of the Anunnaki. It will take the Anunnaki few more years to come up with a final “human product” capable of thinking and unders tanding. 440.000- 430.000 B.C.: More Anunnaki landed on Earth. And more genetic experiments were conducted on the early human races. The interglacial became warmer, and this change in temperature allowed the Anunnaki’s created human races to thrive. The Anunnaki added new mental faculties to their creation. It was at this time in history that those human races began to acquire additional sensorial and mental capabilities such as “memory” and “sense of collectivity”. In the Phoenician waters, the Anunnaki se arched for aquatic bacteria such as fungi much needed for the development of certain organs of the Homo Sapiens. 415,000- 416,000 B.C : With the arrival of Anu and Enlil on Earth, a major part of the Anunnaki’s expansion operations shifted to the Central African continent. Enlil was in command of the whole enterprise, and became powerful on Earth ruling the Anunnaki living in the Near East, Middle East and occasionally in Africa. Enlil relinquished his authority in Africa to Enki, and planned on returning to Ashtari (Nibiru). A mutiny exploded in the Sumer lands headed by the grandson of Alalu. 400,000 B.C. The Anunnaki established seven large settlements in the southern region of Mesopotamia that included: a-Enormous metallurgical center in Shuruppak. b-Several space launching and landing pads controlled by centralized center in Sippar. c-A space travel command center in Nippur and Baalbeck. To establish a peaceful relationship with the Igigi, the Anunnaki g ave them a generous portion of Africa’s mined natural resources and other minerals. The Igigi transported the mineral shipments to space stations orbiting the Earth, and from there, immense Anunnaki’s spacecrafts shipped the loads to Ashtari -Ne.Be.Ru. (Nib iru) 380,000 B.C.: A war waged by the Enlilites devastated the region. This was a perfect timing for Alalu’s grandson to re-seize power, especially that the Igigi gave him full military support. These were turbulent days for the Anunnaki. Marduk's allies, the Igigi, ruled vast estates and irrigated lands in Phoenicia (Modern Lebanon) and Sumer. Nabu, Marduk's son, summoned these Igigi communities to Marduk’s city, Babylon, to build a launch tower from which Marduk could challenge the Enlilites’ spaceport in the Sinai.

SUMERIA IN BIBLICAL CONTEXT The story of the antediluvians still rank among the greatest mysteries in the Bible. Unfortunately, we are still limited when it comes to documented proof of the existence of this lost society although wit h a new generation of 21st century archaeological research tools, documented evidence of the antediluvian society may be headlines in tomorrow’s newspaper. Should artifacts of this society be discovered, it would truly rank among the greatest discoveries ever made and would definitely change the world we live in today. The most obvious candidate would be the discovery of physical remains of Noah's Ark. Biblical archaeology r eally begins with the Post Flood era and originates with the Sumerian civilization of about 2500 BC. To date, numerous sites and artifacts have been uncovered that reveal a great deal about the ancient Mesopotamian culture. One of the most dramatic finds i s the Sumerian King List, which dates to approximately 2100 BC. This collection of clay tablets and prisms is most exciting because it divides the Sumerian kings into two categories; those who reigned before the \"great flood\" and those who reigned after it. The lists are also dramatic because they include the ages of the kings before and after the \"great flood,\" which show the same phenomenal life span changes mentioned in the Bible. The Sumerian King List is an ancient list of Mesopotamian rulers: their names, their seat of power and the length of their reigns. The list as we have it today is actually a critical reconstruction of nearly 20 ancient fragments published in 1939 by the renowned Danish, Sumerologist Thorkild Jacobson. The list is of special interest to the biblical archaeological community, particularly because of its antediluvian (pre-flood) portion. The list of pre-flood kings is interesting for two reasons. First, because it mentions an antediluvian civilization and a cataclysmic deluge, and second, because the pre-flood kings have really long life-spans (as is evidenced by their really long reigns). After the flood, the life-spans drop dramatically but remain inordinately long for a time. The length of monarchial reigns gradually decreases until they reflect ordinary life-spans. This parallels the biblical account somewhat, except that the life-spans represented in the Sumerian King List are a lot longer than those in the biblical account. The average reign of the antediluvian king in the Sumerian King List was 30,150 years. The average life-span of the biblical antediluvian patriarch recorded in Genesis was 858 years (no where near as long but still inordinately long). Dr. Raul Lopez believes that the information contained in the antediluvian portion of the Sumerian King List may have originated with the Semitic “Noah’s Flood” tradition and thus supports the Genesis account. He believes that the gross discrepancies in the ages can be accounted for quite simply by a"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 26 major difference between the Semitic numbering system and the Sumerian’s, and the fact that both civilizations used the same symbols to express numbers. The Semitic people used a decimal (base 10) system like the one we use today. The Sumerians used a sexagesimal (base 60) system. Dr. Lopez believes that the two people groups used the same symbols to express numbers (so that the Semitic “10” shared the same symbol as the Sumerian “60,” etc.) and that when a Sumerian scribe came across a Semitic tablet (or perhaps an oral tradition) purporting to document details concerning the antediluvian kings, he misinterpreted the numbers and his error was passed on. Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer observed: “One remarkable fact is that only a century ago nothing was known even of the existence of these Sumerians in ancient days. The archaeologists and scholars who, some hundred years ago, began excavating in that part of the Middle East known as Mesopotamia were looking not for Sumerians but for Assyrians and Babylonians. On these peoples and their civilizations they had considerable information from Greek and Hebrew sources, but of Sumer and the Sumerians they had no inkling. There was no recognizable trace either of the land or of its people in the entire literature available to the modern scholar. The very name Sumer had been erased from the mind and memory of man for more than two thousand years ” 5 Some linguists have suggested that the Hebrew term Shinar (Genesis 10:10) used for Mesopotamia may be derived from the Akkadian term Shumer for the Sumerians; Smith cites the terms \"Sumir or Shinar\" as dialectical equivalents within the known latitude of linguistic shift (Smith, A Chaldean Account of Genesis , 20). In view of the historical SH/S transition and the M/N dialectical equivalency in some early languages, the Shinar=Sumer (Sumeria) derivation appears to be a better linguistic match than other uncertain derivations that have been proposed, such as Shene nahar \"two rivers\" or Shene \"two cities.\" The designation of the worl d's first civilization after the great deluge as occurring in the land of Shinar/Shumer or Sumeria has been hiding in plain sight in the Book of Genesis for more than two millennia after the name and identity of the Sumerians had been lost to all the rest of the world. A litany of firsts belong to the Sumerian civilization (ibid), and later Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian civilizations were highly dependent upon Sumer for their culture and knowledge. Kramer's History Begins at Sumer is an excellent sour ce for beginning to appreciate Sumeria's great and irrefutable contributions to the world upon which all subsequent civilizations have built. When we examine the list of cities of King Nimrod, we find that they were all originally Sumerian cities: • Babel was a Sumerian city before it became a Babylonian one, and Babylonian culture was built almost enti rely upon Sumerian achievements • Erech is designated as the city of Uruk by the Sumerian King's list and is the city where we find the world's first writing: \"The first written documents were found in a Sumerian city named Erech.\" (Kramer, History, 3) • Accad is the seat of the Akkadian civilization • The identity of Calneh is unknown but has been associated with Nippur (one of the most ancient Sum erian cities) by some scholars"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 27 These are among the first known cities in the history of the world. However, Nimrod's kinsmen did not have complete hegemony upon these cities. The previously cited verses note that \"out of that land [of Shinar] went forth Asshur [son of Shem, a semite and father of the Assyrians), and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\" The descendants of Shem through Elam, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram also settled in clos e proximity. It appears that Nimrod had a multicultural em pire even if his kinsman may have dominated in certain cities. These verses suggest significant colonization between the peoples of Mesopotamia and those of North Africa and Egypt. Were the Sumerians the first in the land? They were not far from the beginning, as Nimrod was a great- grandson of Noah, although life spans in this age were longer than at present. The Book of Jasher tells the story of Nimrod traveling east to found a city in Mesopotamia ( Jasher 7:43) and then conquering the surrounding lands: And Nimrod dwelt in Shinar, and he reigned securely, and he fought with his enemies and he subdued them, and he prospered in all his battles, and his kingdom became very great. And all nations and tongues heard of his fame, and they gathered themselves to him, and they bowed down to the earth, and they brought him offerings, and he became their lord and king, and they all dwelt with him in the city of Shinar, and Nimrod reigned in the earth over all the sons of Noah, and they were all under his power and counsel. (Jasher 7:44 -45) The archaeological evidence also supports the conclusion that the Sumerians obtained their empire through conquest, and that most Sumerian cities were built on top of older cities (Kramer, History, 234- 35). Kramer notes: “As a result of determining the existence of a Sumerian Heroic Age, we seem justified in draing the conclusion that the Sumerians were not the first settlers in Lower Mesopotamia, but that they must have been preceded by a civilized power of some magnitude, one that was culturally far more advanced than the Sumerians. What is generally spoken of as a 'Sumerian' civilization - a civilization that played a predominant role in the Ancient Near East, and whose i nfluence persisted long after the Sumerians had ceased to exist as a political entity...resulted no doubt from a constructive application of the Sumerian genius to the material and spiritual heritage of the pre - Sumerian civili zation in Southern Mesopotamia ” 5 The great value of Sumerology reflects not only the original accomplishments of the Sumerians, but the legacy they have passed down through their records, technology, and achievements of an earlier, even greater civilization, the knowledge of which has been otherwise lost to history. Accordingly Genesis chapters 9-11 give us many details of the colonization of Sumeria (Biblical \"Shinar\") and subsequent rise of Nimrod's kingdom. In Genesis 9 mankind had consisted of the families of Noah and his three sons (Shem, Japheth and Ham) By Genesis 11 we read of \"'the whole earth,\" \"the children of men\" and \"the people\": terms that indicate a large population. Considering the long ages ascribed to them in Scripture, Noah lived for another 350 years after the flood and Shem another 500 years it seems peculiar that the Bible does not mention Noah or any of his sons in Sumeria. Some scholars such as Epiphanius 1315-405 AD. L Sir William Jones (1746-1794) and Jacob Bryant (1715-1805), have suggested that Genesis 11: 1, which speaks of mankind's having one language, and Genesis 11:2, which describes the initial colonization of Sumer, should be viewed as two separate events. The postflood cradle of mankind, they argued, was mount Ararat, and it was only a segment of the human race that journeyed to Sumeria. Thus the family of Noah might not he mentioned in connection with Sumer because they did not go there."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 28 Shortly after their arrival the colonists began building with baked brick (Genesis 11:3) and then planned an immense city and tower (Genesis 11:4). This city is usually attributed to Nimrod. His is the thirteenth name mentioned in the genealogy & Noah's son Ham, and he was the son of Cush - which is better written Csh, as there were no vowels in the first copies of Genesis. His kingdom, the first of many upon the earth, encompassed the cities of Babel , Erech and Accad God was not pleased with the building of the city and tower of Babel a structure which was meant to tower into heaven and he scattered the people of Babel across the face of the earth. Something of the extent of this scattering can be seen in that while Nimrod is usually associated with Sumer, his father Csh has often been linked to Ethiopia, his grandfather Ham and uncle Mizraim are associated with Egyp t, and two other uncles are thought to have led coloni es to Libya. Israel and Lebanon. The biblical context puts the rise of Sumeria at somewhere after the flood at around the time of Nimrod.

THE BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE FALLEN ONES GENESIS 6:1 Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them, 2 that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose. 3 And the LORD sai d, \"My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.\" 4 There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. (NKJV) There has been much speculation about who these \"sons of God\" mentioned in the sixth chapter of Genesis were. Three basic interpretations of this passage have been advanced. The first, and oldest, belief is that \"the sons of God\" were fallen angels who consorted with human women, producing giant offspring called nephilim (Heb. םילפנ ). This view was widely held in the world of the first century, and was supported by Flavius Josephus, Philo, Eusebius and many of the \"Ante-Nicene Fathers,\" including Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Athenagoras and Comm odianus. The second view is one which was first suggested by Julius Africanus and later advocated by Saint Augustine, the Catholic Bishop of Hippo. Augustine rejected the concept of the fallen host having committed fornication with women. In his early fifth century book The City of God, he promoted the theory that \"the sons of God\" simply referred to the genealogical line of Seth, who were committed to preserving the true worship of God. He interpreted Genesis 6 to mean that the male offspring of Adam through Seth were \"the sons of God,\" and the female offspring of Adam through Cain were \"the daughters of men.\" He wrote that the problem was that the family of Seth had interbred with the family of Cain, intermingling the bloodlines and corrupting the pure religion. This view has become the dominant one among most modern biblical scholars. The third view is that \"the sons of God\" were the sons of pre-Flood rulers or magistrates. This belief became the standard explanation of rabbinical Judaism after Rabbi Si meon ben Yochai pronounced a curse in the second century CE upon those Jews who believed the common teaching that the angels were responsible for the nephilim. This interpretation was advocated by two of the most respected Jewish sages of the Middle Ages, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (Rashi) and Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Nachmanides), and became the standard explanation of rabbinical Judaism. However, it is not widely accepted by modern scholars. To determine who these \"sons of God\" were, we'll first examine what various outside sources have to say about this topic. Then we'll examine the ultimate authority, the Bible, to see its position. Let's start with a quotation and footnote from William Whitson's translation of the respected first century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus' history of the Jewish people: “ Now this posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the universe, and to have an entire regard to virtue, for seven generations; but in process of time they were perverted, and forsook the practices of their forefathers, and did neither pay those honors to God which were appointed to them, nor had they any concern to do justice towards men. But for what degree of zeal they had formerly shown for virtue, they now showed by their actions a double degree of wickedness; whereby they made God to be their enemy, for many angels* of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust, and despisers of all that was good, on account of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the tradition is, that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the Grecians called giants. But Noah was very uneasy at what they did; and, being displeased at their conduct, persuaded them to change their dispositions and their acts for the better; but, seeing that they did not"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 30 yield to him, but were slaves to their wicked pleasures, he was afraid they would kill him, together with his wife and children, and those they had married; s o he departed out of that land.” 6 * This notion, that the fallen angels were, in some sense the fathers of the old giants, was the constant opinion of antiquity. As you can see, Josephus believed and recorded that \"the sons of God\" mentioned in Genesis 6 were fallen angels. As Whitson's footnote acknowledges, this belief w as standard in the ancient world. Another well -known first century Jewish writer, Philo of Alexandria, shared Josephus' views on this topic. In his work \"On the Giants,\" Philo wrote: \"And when the angels of God saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful, they took unto themselves wives of all them whom they chose.\" Those beings, whom other philosophers call demons, Moses usually calls angels” 7 The Book of Enoch (also called I Enoch) is a collection of pseudepigraphic writings by various author s which dates to the first or second century B.C. This book was well -known by the early church; in fact, Jude, the brother of Jesus, quoted Enoch 1:9 in verses 14 and 15 of his epistle. Obviously Jude felt that the Book of Enoch he had access to in the fir st century was trustworthy. This work, which survived to our day against great odds, deals extensively with the fall of the angels. It was viewed favorably by some early \"Christian\" writers also (Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and others). However, it was never universally accepted as inspired Scripture. Below is a selection from the Book of Enoch which records the sin of the angelic \"watchers\": ENOCH 6:1 And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto 2 them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men 3 and beget us children.' And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not 4 indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and said: ' Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations 5 not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.' Then sware they all together and bound themselves 6 by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on t he summit of Mount Hermon” 8 A similar passage is also found in the pseudepigraphic Book of Jubilees: JUBILEES 5:1 And it came to pass when the children of men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unt o them, that the angels of God saw them on a certain year of this jubilee, that they were beautiful to look upon; and they took themselves wives of all whom they 2 chose, and they bare unto them sons and they were giants. And lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way, alike men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walks on the earth – all of them corrupted their ways and their orders, and they began to devour each other, and lawlessness increased on the earth and ever y imagination of the thoughts of all men 3 (was) thus evil continually ... 8 The Genesis Apocryphon, originally called the Apocalypse of Lamech and labeled 1QapGen, is one of the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in Cave 1 near Qumran in the West Bank. Composed in Aramaic, this document consists of four sheets of leather, and is the least well preserved document of the original seven. The document records a pseudepigraphal conversation between the biblical figure Lamech, son of Methuselah, and his son, Noah. It serves as an example of an expanded and rewritten biblical story. In this text, a conversation between Lamech, the father of Noah, and his wife Bathenosh is detailed. Lamech questions his wife because he thinks that the conception of Noah was due to either an angel or one of their offspring, a nephilim. “Then I considered whether the pregnancy was due to the Watchers and Holy Ones, or (should be ascribed) to the Nephil[im], and I grew perturbed about this child. vacat"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 31 Then I, Lamech, became af raid and went to Batenosh, [my] w[ife ... saying, \"Dec]lare [to me] by the Most High, by the Lord of Greatness, by the E[ternal] King [whether the child comes from the] heavenly beings!

Why has the appearance] of your face changed like this upon you? And (why) is it disfigured, and your spirit dejected like this? [ ... for I] tell you (this) truthfully ” . 9 The Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the Genesis Apocryphon all clearly show that the common understanding at the time of Christ was that the fallen host had committed fornication with women in the period before the flood. As stated previously, many early Christian writers accepted the story told in Enoch as fact. Let's examine the writings of two of them, beginning with Justin Martyr, who lived from 110 CE to 165 CE. Here is what he had to say in chapter 5 of his Second Apology, entitled \"\"How the Angels Transgressed\": “ God, when He had made the whole world, and subjected things earthly to man, and arranged the heavenly elements for the increase of fruits and rotation of the seasons, and appointed this divine law – for these things also He evidently made for man – committed the care of men and of all things under heaven to angels whom He appointed over them. But the angels transgressed this appointment, and were captivated by love of women, and begat children who are those that are called demons; and besides, they afterwards subdued the human race to themselves , partly by magical writings, and partly by fears and punishments they occasioned, and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices, and incense, and libations, of which things they stood in need after they enslaved by lustful passions; and among men they s owed murders, wars, adulteries, intemperate needs, and all wickedness.” 10 Now let's examine chapter 3, \"The Worship of Demons,\" from The Instructions of Commodianus, a North-African bishop who lived about 240 CE: “When Almighty God, to beautify the nat ure of the world, willed that that earth should be visited by angels, when they were sent down they despised His laws. Such was the beauty of women, that it turned them aside; so that, being contaminated, they could not return to heaven. Rebels from God, t hey uttered words against Him. Then the Highest uttered His judgment against them; and from their seed giants are said to have been born. By them arts were made known in the earth, and they taught the dyeing of wool, and everything which is done; and to them, when they died, men erected images. But the Almighty, because they were of an evil seed, did not approve that, when dead, they should be brought back from death. Whence wandering they now subvert many bodies, and it is such as these especially that ye this day worship and pray to as gods. ” 11 The idea that the nephilim or giants were the offspring of the fallen host and human females was not unique to Judaism. This understanding was likely behind the Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythologies, as well as those of India and the near east. All these beliefs resulted not as mere inventions of fertile human imagination, but as a corruption of antediluvian truths which were distorted as their origin was forgotten over time."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 32 Take, for example, the legend of th e Titans. In Greek mythology, the Titans were a family of giant gods who were the offspring of Uranus (heaven) and Gaea (earth). The most famous of the Titans was Cronus, who killed his father. Cronus later led the Titans in their losing war against Zeus and the Olympian gods. After their defeat, the Titans were imprisoned in a section of the underworld called Tartarus. In his second epistle, the apostle Peter uses part of this Greek myth to explain the fate of some of the fallen angels. He states that for their sins, these angels had been tartarosas, which The NKJV Greek English Interlinear New Testament translates literally as \"confining them to Tartarus\" (also known in the Bible as \"the Abyss\"). II PETER 2:4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell [tartarosas] and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; (NKJV) This is the same Tartarus where Greek mythology says the Titans were imprisoned. It's highly unlikely that Peter would have used such an analogy if this pagan legend wasn't based on at least some grain of truth which his readers would have knowledge of. The idea that evil angels mated with human women and had offspring (the nephilim) appears far -fetched to us in this modern era, but it seems to have been widely accepted as fact in the ancient world. As we've seen above, the word translated \"giants\" in Genesis 6:4 is nephilim. Let's look at what The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia has to say about the possible origins of this Hebrew word: The etymology of nepilim is uncertain, the following explanations have been advanced with mixed reception. First, it may derive from the niphal of the verb pala, meaning \"be extraordinary,\" i.e. , \"extraordinary men.\" Second, it may be derived from the verb napal, \"fall,\" in one of the following senses: (1) the \"fallen ones\" – from heaven, i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 33 supernatural beings; (2) morally \"fallen men\"; (3) \"those who fall upon,\" in the sense of invaders or h ostile, violent men; (4) \"those who fell by\" the sword (cf. Ezk. 32:20f.); (5) \"unnaturally begotten men\" or bastards (from cf. nepel, \"abortion\" or miscarriage\"). (pp. 518 -519, vol. 3) Michael S. Heiser, who holds a PhD in biblical Hebrew and ancient Se mitic languages, believes that nephilim actually comes from the Aramaic word naphil, which means \"giants\" according to A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (pp. 923- 924, vol. II) compiled by Marcus Jas trow. The Septuagint Greek translation of the Old Testament renders the Hebrew term nephilim as gigantes, which literally means \"earth- born.\" In Greek mythology, the Gigantes were the sons of Gaia, a savage race of giants eventually defeated by the Olympian gods. From the sources we've just examined, it's readily apparent that the general understanding of Genesis 6:1-4 at the time of Christ was that the angels had sinned by committing fornication with human women. But does the Bible support this theory? First, let's look at all of the Old Testament references to \"sons of God.\" This phrase is translated from the Hebrew beney 'elohim ( ינב םיהלא ), beney ha'elohim ( ינב םיהלאה ), and beney 'elim ( ינב םילא ): GENESIS 6:1 When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them, 2 the divine beings [beney ha'elohim] saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from among those that pleased them. 3 The Lord said, \"My breath shall not abide in man forever , since he too is flesh; let the days allowed him be one hundred and twenty years.\" 4 It was then, and later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth when the divine beings [beney ha'elohim] cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore them offspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown. (Tanakh, the new Jewish Publication Society translation according to the traditional Hebrew text) DEUTERONOMY 32:8 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God [beney 'elohim]. (RSV) JOB 1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God [beney ha'elohim] came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan also came among them. (NKJV) JOB 2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God [beney ha'elohim] came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. (NKJV) JOB 38:4 \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding. 5 Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 6 To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 7 when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God [ beney 'elohim] shouted for joy? (NKJV) PSALM 29:1 O give the Lord you sons of God [beney 'elim], give the Lord glory and power; 2 give the Lord the glory of his name. Adore the Lord in his holy court. (The Psalms: A New Translation) PSALM 89:5 The heav ens proclaim your wonders, O Lord; the assembly of your holy ones proclaims your truth. 6 For who in the skies can compare with the Lord or who is like the Lord among the sons of God [beney 'elim]? (The Psalms: A New Translation) "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 34 As you can see, each reference above is to angels. There are no instances in the Old Testament where the phrase \"sons of God\" refers to men. Let's see what E.W. Bullinger has to say about these \"sons of God\" in Appendix 23 to The Companion Bible: \"The Sons of God\" in Gen. 6.2, 4. It is only by the Divine specific act of creation that any created being can be called \"a son of God.\" For that which is \"born of the flesh is flesh.\" God is spirit and that which is \"born of the Spirit is spirit\" (John 3.6). Hence Adam is called a \"son of God\" in Luke 3.38. Those \"in Christ\" having the \"new nature\" which is by the direct creation of God (2 Cor. 5.17; Eph. 2.10) can be, and are called \"sons of God\" (John 1.13; Rom. 8.14, 15; 1 John 3.1). This is why angels are called \"sons of God\" in every other place where the expression is used in the Old Testament. Job 1.6; 2.1; 38.7; Ps. 29.1; 89.6; Dan. 3.25 (no art.). We have no authority or right to take the expression in Gen. 6.4 in any other sense. Moreover in Gen. 6.2 the Sept. renders it \"angels\". (pp. 26, 27, Companion Bible Appendixes) Now let's look at Genesis 6:9, which discusses Noah's genealogy. This Scripture is further proof that fallen angels had interbred with humans. GENESIS 6:9 This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect [tamim] in his generations. Noah walked with God. (NKJV) In Genesis 6:9, the Hebrew word tamim, here translated \"perfect,\" means \"physically without blemish.\" As the first sentence makes clear, it's referring to the genealogy of Noah; it does not refer to moral perfection. Below is what Appendix 26 of The Companion Bible has to say about this word as used in verse 9 of Genesis 6: The Heb. word tamim means without blemish, and is the technical word for bodily and physical perfection, and, not moral. Hence it is used of animals of sacrificial purity . It is rendered without blemish in Ex. 12.5; 29.1; Lev. 1.3, 10; 3.1, 6; 4.3, 23, 28, 32; 5.12, 18; 6.6; 9.2, 3; 14.10; 22.19; 23.12, 18; Num. 6.14; 28.19, 31; 29.2, 8, 13, 20, 23, 29, 32, 36; Ezek. 43.22, 23, 25; 45.18, 23; 46.4, 6, 13. Without spot: Num. 19.2; 28.3, 9, 11; 29.17, 26. Undefiled: Ps. 119.1. This shows that Gen. 6.9 does not speak of Noah's moral perfection . . . (p. 28, Companion Bible Appendixes) Now let's examine what Jude said about the fallen angels in the New Testament: JUDE 6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. 7 Even as Sodom and Gomor rha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. (KJV) Because of the punctuation of verse 7, this Scripture appear s to say that Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as the cities around them, gave themselves over to sexual immorality. However, the underlying Greek text does not support this interpretation. Kenneth Wuest writes of verse 7: This verse begins with hos, an adver b of comparison having meanings of \"in the same manner as, after the fashion of, as, just as.\" Here it introduces a comparison showing a likeness between the angels of verse 6 and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha of this verse. But the likeness between the m lies deeper than the fact that both were guilty of committing sin. It extends to the fact that both were guilty of the same identical sin. The punctuation of the A.V. [KJV] is misleading, as an examination of Greek text discloses. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 35 The A.V. punctuation gives the reader the impression that Sodom and Gomorrha committed fornication and that the cities about them committed fornication in like manner to the two cities named. . . . The words \"in like manner\" are related to the verbal forms , \"giving themselves over to fornication\" and \"going after strange flesh.\" In addition to all this, the Greek text has toutois, \"to these.\" Thus, the translation should read, \"just as Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them, in like manner to these, having given themselves over to fornication and having gone after strange flesh.\" The sense of the entire passage (vv.6, 7) is that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them, in like manner to these (the angels), have given themselves over to fornication and have gone after strange flesh. That means that the sin of the fallen angels was fornication.” 12 The underlying Greek text indicates that the fallen angels left their own domain and indulged in sexual immorality, going after \"strange,\" or \"other\" flesh. The KJV obscures this fact, probably because the view that the fallen angels were \"the sons of God\" spoken of in Genesis 6:2, 4 was not accepted when it was translated in 1611. However, some translations do more clearly show the meaning of this passage. The New English Bible better presents what Jude was saying: JUDE 6 Remember too the angels, how some of them were not content to keep the dominion given to them but abandoned their proper home; and God has reserved them for judgement on t he great Day, bound beneath the darkness in everlasting chains. 7 Remember Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbouring towns; like the angels, they committed fornication and followed unnatural lusts; and they paid the penalty in eternal fire, an example for al l to see. (NEB) It's clear that Jude wrote of the fornication of the angels as a fact. In verse 7 of his epistle, he compares the sexual wickedness in Sodom, Gomorrah, and the surrounding cities to the sin of the angels. The nature of the angels' fall is also clearly stated in Jude 6, where it is said that they left their own \"abode\" (Gr. oiketerion). This word occurs in the New Testament only here and in II Corinthians 5:2, where it is used of the spiritual body of a resurrected saint. II CORINTHIANS 5 :1 For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation [oiketerion] which is from hea ven, (NKJV) It is also important at this juncture to make the following three statements . Firstly there is more to this than just the fact of fallen angels all of a sudden desiring to have sexual relationships with human’s. Whilst the references provided prove that there was a wave of angelic beings who bypassed the boundaries of angelic and human relations to commit a sin against Gods order, it is clear that this was more than just lust. The emphasis is sometimes lost in that this was a premeditated strategy by Lucifer to corrupt the human race to prevent the possibility of a future Messiah ever being born. Fallen angels have no real love for human beings. Rather their depraved nature is such that their sole mission is to corrupt humanity and provoke spiritual blindness so that many are damned eternally. Secondly it was a special class of 300 angels known as “watchers” who decided to break universal code. They were of the grigori order. The term grigori derives from the greek “Egregoroi” meaning the “watchers”. The angels were under the rank of arch angels so we know they were of a lower class. Although the angels committed sexual sins and corrupted the human lineage to some extent, they did something else that threatened to foil God's plan for humanity and which affected the human race.

APOCRYPHA REVEALS TECHNOLOGY ACCELERATION In the Dead Sea Scrolls the name Azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4Q203, the Book of the Giants. This is a part of the Enochic literature about fallen angels found at Qumran. The Book of Enoch, brings Azazel into connection with the Biblical story of the fall of the angels, located on Mount Hermon, a gathering-place of demons from of old. “Azazel is represented in the Book of Enoch as one of the leaders of the rebellious Watchers in the time preceding the flood; he taught men the art of warfare, of making swords, knives, shields, and coats of mail, and women the art of deception by ornamenting the body, dying the hair, and painting the face and the eyebrows, and also re vealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners, leading them into wickedness and impurity; until at last he was, at the Lord's command, bound hand and foot by the archangel Raphael and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of [H a] Duduael (= Beth Ḥ adudo), where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great Day of Judgment, when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever .” 13 1 ENOCH 8:1 “ And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of c ostly stones, and all 2 colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they 3 were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways. Semjaza taught enchantments, and root -cuttings, Armaros the resolving of enchantments, Baraqijal (taught) astrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon. And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven” 14 “The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.” — 1 Enoch 10:8 The corruption brought on by Azazel and the Grigori degrades the human race, and the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Phanuel) “saw much blood being shed upon the earth and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth [...] The souls of men [made] their suit, saying, \"Bring our cause before the Most High; [...] Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were in heaven, which men were striving to learn.\" 14 God sees the sin brought about by Azazel and has Raphael “bind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert – which is in Dudael – and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there forever, and cover his face that he may not see light.” 14 Several scholars have previously discerned that some details of Azazel's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat ritual. Thus, Lester Grabbe points to a number of parallels between the Azazel narrative in 1 Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including “the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land.” Daniel Stökl also observes that “the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, action, time and purpose.” Thus, the place of Asael’s punishment designated in 1 Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. Stökl remarks that “the name of place of judgment (Dudael) is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 37 Azazel's fate is foretold near the end of 1 Enoch 2:8, where God says , “On the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. [...] The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.\" 14 Interestingly in the 1998 movie “Fallen” starring Denzel Washington as policeman John Hobbes. Hobbes gains notoriety for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas). After Reese is executed, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) investigate a string of murders by an apparent copycat killer. Eventually Hobbes tracks down the killer and confronts him alone, where the man makes a startling claim: he is the same killer Hobbes sentenced to death, but not Edgar Reese; rather, he is the demon Azazel, and was possessing Reese's body during the murders. Azazel claims he can possess any person m erely by touching them. One of the few exceptions is Detective Hobbes, which has turned Azazel's ire at the Detective for capturing him into an obsession. Hobbes is skeptical of Azazel's claims until the demon begins to sing \"Time Is on My Side\", then begi ns to possess people via touch, continuing to sing the song as he moves from body to body before fading away into the crowd of people on the street. As the text in the Book of Enoch shows, the angels brought with them knowledge which humanity did not have beforehand. This information led to a rapid advance in the knowledge base of the antediluvian society, including the invention of advanced methods of waging warfare. In the NKJV translation of Genesis 6:4, the nephilim are called \"mighty men who were of old, men of renown;\" however, the NRSV translates that same phrase as \"heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.\" Genesis 6:11 shows that the earth was filled with violence; this is very likely the direct result of the nephilim, who apparently were mighty warriors. There is also an indication from the ancient text known as the Book of Jasher that this corruption of bloodlines extended to the animals also. JASHER 4:18 “And their judges and rulers went to the daughters of men and took their wives by force from their husbands according to their choice, and the sons of men in those days took from the cattle of the earth, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and taught the mixture of animals of one species with the other, in order therewith to provoke the Lord; and God saw the whole earth and it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon earth, all men and all animals. 19 And the Lord said, I will blot out man that I created from the face of the earth, yea from man to the birds of the air, together with cattle and b easts that are in the field” 15 The Book of Jasher is mentioned twice in the Bible (Jos. 10:13; II Sam. 1:18). While it's evident the copy of this book that has survived to our time has been corrupted to some extent, the Scriptures seem to confirm the information contained in this section of Jasher. Humanity has been assaulted since the dawn of time by beings with one purpose, to corrupt the image of God and his creation. The fallen angels descended in the days of Jared, raped women and produced giants as offspring. Yet, they did not stop there, teaching mankind all sorts of dark arts and technologies, including the working of metals for war (Enoch 8:1) and the blood sacrifice of abortion (Enoch 69:12), and Transgenics (i.e. Transhumanism). They butchered the entire genetic order, both man and beast, \"for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth\" (Genesis 6:12). It was not just man, but it w as also the animals whose genetic order had been corrupted, for Yehovah declared , \"I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals, to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them\" (Genesis 6:7, emphasis mine). The Lord starts by saying he will destroy man but shifts for some reason to include the animal kingdom in the destruction as well, being grieved in his heart that He made any of them, man or animals. Animals do not sin, they ar e just animals; it is man that sins. God could have created a deadly virus that only affected humans and given Noah and his 7 family member immunity if it was only man's evil. Yet, there"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 38 was something awry and wrong with even the animals during this period of human history. One must remember that Noah and his family were stated to be \"perfect in [their] generations\" (Genesis 6:9, KJV) and since the Lord was obviously grieved at the animal kingdom, it is only logical to assume the animals saved on the Ark w ere as well. We have all heard stories from Greek mythology like Medusa, a woman with snakes emanating from her head and turned m en to stone who looked at her. There are many stories about the Centaurs, the Minotaurs, the Pegasus, and Mermaids; strange creatures that are all part human and part animal. All the Greek gods fathered many children with women of earth, including Poseidon who founded the city of Atlantis for his hybrid children to dwell, which interestingly, is said to have sank into the ocean. Zeus also fathered many children, including a child by raping Leda while in the form of an animal, a swan. Interestingly, the ancient texts recount that \"the angels who have connected themselves with women, and their spirits, assuming many different forms, are defiling mankind\" (Enoch 19:1, emphasis mine). We not only see bestiality here, nor do we only see fallen angels raping women, but a combination of both as a form of Transhumanism. Regarding this strange corruption, the book of Jubilees echoes the passage from Genesis, saying: \"And lawlessness increased on the earth and all flesh corrupted its way, alike men and cattle and beasts and birds and everything that walketh on the earth - all of them corrupted their ways and their orders, and they began to devour each other, and lawlessness increased on the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of men (was) thus evil continually. And God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, and all flesh had corrupted its orders, and all that were upon the earth had wrought all manner of evil before His eyes\" (Jubilees 5:2 -3) And just like the Nephilim coming up after the flood as more fallen angels came unto women, transgenics continued as well. The book of Jasher tells about an encounter that Es au's grandson Zepho (Genesis 36:15; Jasher 36:23) had with a Centaur, or perhaps a Satyr, when one of his oxen went astray, saying: \"And Zepho went and he saw and behold there was a large cave at the bottom of the mountain, and there was a great stone there at the entrance of the cave, and Zepho split the stone and he came into the cave and he looked and behold, a large animal was devouring the ox; from the middle upward it resembled a man, and from the middle downward it resembled an animal, and Zepho rose up against the animal and slew it with his sword\" (Ja sher 61:15). "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 39 Satyrs were goat-like men living in the wild places of the earth while Centaurs were horse-like, savage creatures; both were known for their lustful ways, such as the legend of King Pirithous of the Lapiths inviting the Centaurs to his wedding, for they were related to his bride. Aside from mythology, we also see many archeaological evidences of strange human-animal chimeras in ancient Egypt, Greece, and the Americas. The most notable being the great Sphinx, which is a monument depicting a creature like the one Zepho killed, with the head of a human and the body of a lion. Yet, there are also many hieroglyphics depicting many of the Egyptian gods, such as Anubis, who had the head of a jackal and the body of a man, and helped embalm the god Osiris (fallen angel). Why would the ancient Egyptians be so precise and accurate in so much and then decide to completely change people in their art to have the head of an animal? It used to be thought that the depictions of King Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti were only shown to have elongated skulls because that was the artistic style of the time, yet upon discovery of their tomb, the two actually did have elongated skulls. Some say this may have been a custom, much like elongating the neck at birth in some countries, yet they are the only rulers in Egypt to have such strange features, and due to child mortality rates, numerous children would have had to have their heads elongated from birth to ensure there would be a surviving child with an elongated head to be the King, which would mean we would see many other depictions of people with enlongated heads that survived as well. We find none, except Akhenaten and his Queen, and the artistic renderings of Akhenaten display that the Egyptians were very precise and accurate in their art. There has even been a tomb discovered in Egypt filled with the bones of creatures that were half-human and half-bull. The lid of the tomb is a massive granite slab sealed shut with mortar. The ancient Egyptians typically reserved tomb s for royalty and mummified the corpses for pr eservation into the afterlife. However, these strange creatures were entombed in such a way that they would not return in the afterlife, ensuring no possible resurrection of these horrific creatures seemingly out of H.G. Wells', \"The Island of Doctor Moreau.\" If only they had the words of the prophet Isaiah, they would have known that the Nephilim and all the other hybrids are not eligible for the resurrection and there was nothing to worry about, for \"the dead will not live, the [Rephaim] will not rise\" (Isaiah 26:14a). Planet earth's past is filled with strange tales of fallen angels, Nephilim, and Trans -Human beings, all memorialized in the ancient myths and cultures of every ancient civilization and recorded accurately in God's Holy Word, the Bible. \"In those days\" plainly means the time after the \"sons of God\" had come down to earth; the fact that they had taken wives is disclosed in Genesis 6:2. In time sequence, chapter six of Genesis should follow chapter four; the fifth chapter is an inset into the story flow. \"Afterward\" specifies after the flood, when we see another instance of giants appearing, this time in the land of Canaan which the Israelites were to inherit (Num. 13:33). Satan once again tried to thwart God's plan by using these savage hybrids to occupy the land of Canaan and keep Abraham's offspring out. Obviously none of the nephilim survived the Flood. These giants are often mentioned in the early books of the Old Testament until the last of them were finally killed off. The word nephilim only appears twice in the Old Testament (Gen 6:4; Num. 13:33), but these giants are also referred to as gibbor (Gen 6:4; Num. 13:33; Job 16:14) and rephaim when they reappear in a more limited fashion after the flood (Gen. 14:5; 15:20; Deu. 2:11, 20; 3:11, 13; Jos. 12:4; 13:12; 15:8; 17:15; 18:16; II Sam. 5:18, 22; 21:16, 18, 20, 22; 23:13; I Chr. 11:15; 14:9; 20:4, 6, 8; Isa. 17:5; 26:14). They were known by the proper names of Rephaim, Zuzim, Emim, Horites , Anakim, Zamzummim, and Avim.

RECONCILING SUMERIA WITH THE BIBLE Most people at some time during their life discover striking similarities between Christianity and the world’s most ancient religions. • The Igigi revolted against Enlil • The Grigori reolvted against Yaweh • The term “Igigi” means those who watch and see • The term “Grigori means “the watchers/2 • Enlil flooded the earth because the “clambering” of man was making him angry. • Yaweh flooded the earth because of man’s wickedness and the interbreeding of the fallen angels • Enki told Ziusudra to build an ark • Yaweh told Noah to build an ark. Some use this to discredit the Hebrew faith, claiming that stories from the Old Testament, especially the record of Creation and the epic of Noah’s flood, w ere borrowed from earlier Sumerian cosmology. However this parallelism within Sumerian, Hebrew, Greek and Egyptian religion can be fully explained. In the original biblical creation a perfect revelation was given from the Creator to man “in the beginning.” The first man was at one with God and perceived divine knowledge from the mind of God. The human was “in tune” with the mental processes of God and understood, therefore, what God knew about science, astronomy, cosmogony, geology, eschatology, etc. In Hebrew and Christian tradition, after Adam fell, he was “detached” from the mind of God but retained an imperfect memory of the divine revelation, including a knowledge of God’s plan of redemption. Two things began to occur in the decades following this separation. Information from the original revelation became distant and distorted as it was dispersed among nations and passed from generation to generation by oral tradition, and second, evil supernaturalism seized upon the opportunity to receive worship and to turn people away from Yahweh by distorting and counterfeiting the original revelation with pagan ideas and “gods.” This point of view is the choice of some scholars when considering that the earliest history and archaeological records from civilizatio ns around the world attest to what appears to be a singular and original story. In their startling book The Discovery of Genesis, the Rev. C.H. Kang and Dr. Ethel R. Nelson confirm that prehistoric, Chinese, ideographic pictures (used in very ancient Chinese writing) report the story of Genesis, including the creation of the Man and Woman, the garden, the temptation and Fall, Noah’s flood, and the tower of Babel. So we have an incredible parallel between the accounts of the Sumerians and the accounts of the Bible and Apocrypha in regards to the debate. In his book The Real Meaning Of The Zodiac, 16 Dr. James Kennedy claims that the ancient signs of the Zodiac indicate a s ingular and original revelation, a kind of Gospel in the stars and that the message of the stars, although converted into astrology later, originally recorded the Gospel. According to Kennedy: There exists in the writings of virtually all civilized nations a description of the major stars in the heavens, something which might be called their “Constellations of the Zodiac” or the “Signs of the Zodiac,” of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 41 which there are twelve. If you go back in time to Rome, or beyond that to Greece, or before that to Egypt, Persia, Assyria, or Babylonia, regardless of ho w far back you go, there is a remarkable phenomenon: Nearly all nations had the same twelve signs, representing the same twelve things, placed in the same order....The book of Job, which is thought by many to be the oldest book of the Bible, goes back to approximately 2150 BC, which is 650 years before Moses came upon the scene to write the Pentateuch; over 1,100 years before Homer wrote the Odyssey and the Illiad; and 1,500 years before Thales, the first of the philosophers, was born. In Chapter 38, God fi nally breaks in and speaks to Job and to his false comforters. As He is questioning Job, showing him and his companions their ignorance, God says to them: “Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?” (Job 38.31-32). We see here reference to the constellations of Orion and Pleiades, and the star Arcturus. Also in the book of Job there is reference to Cetus, the Sea Monster, and to D raco, the Great Dragon. I would call your attention to Job 38.32a: “Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?” Mazzaroth is a Hebrew word which means “The Constellations of the Zodiac.” In what may be the oldest book in all of human history, we find that the constellations of the zodiac were already cle arly known and understood. . . Having made it clear that the Bible expressly, explicitly, and repeatedly condemns what is now known as astrology, the fact remains that there was a God-given Gospel [universally acknowledged original revelation] in the stars which lays beyond and behind that which has now been corrupted. Thus, Dr. Kennedy asserts that the constellations of the zodiac were likely given by God to the first man as “record -keepers” of the original revelation. If the assumption of this view is correct—that an original revelation degenerated into global mythology following a break in the relationship between Creator and creation—one should be able to find numerous examples of mythological stories from as far back as the beginning of history and within various civilizations around the world that are actually based on an original revelation. Since the myths behind the gods would thus be “borrowed” ideas, the corrupted texts would be similar to the original truth and, in that sense, evidence that a singular and original revelation existed. So for instance where the Sumerian understanding was that the annunanki sky gods were responsible for the creation of mankind we know that the original truth which was distorted was that the “Sons of God” or “Fallen Angels” who came from the sky to interbreed with humans were not responsible for the creation of mankind. Rather they came down for a specific purpose which was to corrupt the human race to prevent the coming of a messiah. The human race had already been created by Yahweh. Obviously the way the annuanki revealed themselves to the Sumerians would have been almost identical to the extra-terrestrial phenomena today where studies of alien abductions show that the messages conveyed to the abductee is one in which the extra-terrestrials claim to be the “elohim” an advanced civilisation who watch over the fate of the earth and whom were responsible for the genesis of mankind thousands of years ago. The detail provided in the Book of Enoch and Jasher about the interaction between the fallen angels and mankind during the antediluvian era fits the Sumerian story as far as the fact it was this close encounter between mankind and the supernatural which resulted in a significant fast track of technology and advancement for the Sumerian dynasty as evi denced by the decoding of the clay tablets found during then nineteenth century.

'The Illuminati exist today under many different names and many different occupations.' Cooper told us. 'They practice Hegalian conflict/resolution. They appear to oppose each other at the bottom ranks, but at the highest levels they are actually organizing and controlling the confl ict which they have created to produ ce the solution that they seek.” 17 \"'The Illuminati are extremely powerful, very wealthy men.

They further believe that everything that they do is for the ultimate betterment and survival of humankind -- even if it means killing two billion people to reach their goal... \" 17 The connection between Sumeria and the Black Nobility or bloodlines of the Illuminati today is that these royal bloodlines trace their ancestral links all the way back to Israel and then further back to Egypt and Sumeria as being bloodlines that have a supernatural element. They believe that they are the lineage of the anunnaki who came to earth to teach men sacred and secret knowledge. These bloodlines have been listed in Fritz Springmeiers books, “Bloodlines of the Illuminati ” and include the following families, the Rothschilds, Merovingians , Duponts, Rockefellers, Bundy, Astor, Collins, Freeman, Kennedy, Li, Onassis, Van Duyn. Most of these bloodlines are predominantly European and further below we provide two examples of how these bloodlines trace their lineage back to the anunnak i of the Sumerian era. Research has shown that one of the oldest secret societies to emerge out of the Sumerian era is an occultic order called the “Brotherhood of the Serpent” which was started by the Anunnaki, Ea. Researchers who specialise in understanding occ ultic orders are all unanimous i n the fact that the beliefs of many of the occult fraternities today whether it be freemasonry, k abbalah, theosophy etc all trace their roots back to Babylon, Egypt and Sumeria in this particular order. Considering that the Genesis account of creation refers to an ongoing rivalry between mankind and the seed of the serpent as a result of the fall, many believe that the seed of the serpent refers to an actual demonic lineage which invol ves beings shaped with serpent like features. In the Sumerian tablets, Enlil is described as the Splendid Serpent of the Shining Eyes, while his half brother Enki is represented with two entwined serpents (similar to the ancient caduceus – symbol of the modern medical profession). The Ubaid culture (one of the earliest tribes in the area of Sumeria) existed between 5,000 and 4,000 BC, even before Sumer, in what is now Iraq and figurines of their gods are clear representations of repti le-like, lizard-like humanoids. The region where the Ubaid-Sumer cultures emerged is fundamental to this whole story and the Ubaid figurines depict physically the descriptions of ‘gods’ which dominated many ancient societies.

This Brotherhood of the Snake opposed the ensl avement of spiritual beings and, according to Egyptian writings, it sought to liberate the human race from Custodial bondage.The Brotherhood also imparted scientific knowledge and encouraged the high aesthetics that existed in many ancient societies.Becaus e Brotherhood teachings included physical healing through spiritual means, the snake also came to symbolize physical healing.Ancient Mesopotamian tablets relate that Ea and his father, Anu, possessed profound ethical and spiritual knowledge. This was the same knowledge that was later symbolized as trees in the Biblical Adam and Eve story.Despite good intentions, the legendary Ea and early Brotherhood clearly failed to free the human race. Ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and biblical texts relate that they were quickly defeated by other Custodial factions. After its reported defeat, the brotherhood continued to remain a powerful force in human affairs, but under the domination of the very Custodial factions that Ea and the original Brotherhood were opposed. The early kings of Sumer, Egypt, and later, Israel, were anointed at their coronation with the ‘fat of the Dragon’ which was the fat of the sacred crocodile. The croc odile was known in Egypt as a messeh and from this comes the Hebrew term ‘Messiah’ which means Anointed One. The kings of the succession were also known as ‘Dragons’ and all this symbolism relates to the knowledge that these royal families were the bloodlines of the reptile- human crossbreeds. When many kingdoms joined together in battle, they appointed a king of kings and he was known as the Great Dragon or... Draco. Serpent Worship in one form or another has appeared in every single culture in every corner of the Earth. The Serpent mounds of the American Indian, Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered S erpent and the carved-stone snakes of Central and South America, Python, the Great Snake of the Greeks, the Sacred Serpents of the Druids, Jörmungandr, the Midgard Serpent of Scandinavia, the Nagas of Burma, Siam, and Cambodia, the hooded Cobras of India, the Brazen Serpent of the Jews, the Mystic Serpent of"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 44 Orpheus, the Serpents at the Oracle of Delphi, the Sacred Serpents preserved in the Egyptian Temples, the Uraeus coiled upon the foreheads of the Pharaohs, Queens, Priestesses and Priests. The Serpent is found upon the Temple of Naki -Rustan in Persia, on the triubmphal arch at Pechin, in China, over the gates of the great Temple of Chaundi Teeva, in Java and upon the walls of Athens, the portals of Egyptian Temples, decorated with the hieroglyph of the Circle and the Serpent. All of these bear witness to the Universal Veneration and High Esteem in which the Serpent was held. In the Ancient Mystery Schools the Serpent-entwined Staff of Hermes was the Symbol of Healing and, indeed, still it remains so, even to the present day, for it is the emblem of the modern medical profession. The Reverend John Bathhurst Deane in his book The Worship Of The Serpent, wrote: “...One of (the) five builders of Thebes (in Egypt) was named after the serpent -god of the Phoenicians, Ofhion... The first altar erected to Cyclops at Athens, was to ‘Ops’, the serpent -deity... The symbolic worship of the serpent was so common in Greece, that Justin Martyr accuses the Greeks of introducing it into the mysteries of all their gods. T he Chinese... are said to be superstitious in choosing a plot of ground to erect a dwelling house or sepulchre: conferring it with the head, tail and feet of diverse dragons which live under the Earth.” 18 The idea of fire breathing dragons and evil serpents which appear in legends and texts all over the world could easily originate from the reptilian ‘gods’ who once operated openly thousands of years ago. These were the Serpent People of ancient texts, including the Bible, where the serpent is a regular theme. Of course, the serpent has been used to symbolize many things and not every reference will be literally a reptile, certainly not. But many of them are. There is also a common theme of a sacred place being guarded by a serpent or dragon. We have the serpent in the Garden of Eden and the serpent/dragon theme is global. Sometimes much of this information sounds like some fictional novel out of the Lord of the Rings so to provide some cl ear evidence as to what these bloodlines today believe here is a clear example. HRH Prince Nicholas de Vere, Sovereign Grand Master of the Imperial and Royal Dragon Court, purports to be an \"Official History of the Dragon Peoples.\" The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court is the ancient Household Court and Order of the senior Angevin descendants of the Imperial and Royal House of Vere of Caledonia, Anjou and Lorraine, and the physical embodiment of the Sovereign Princedom of Drakenberg; which is recognised under European Law as a sovereign ethnic racial group; the princ iple nation state of the Draconian peoples: According to its history The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court and Order has existed since the very dawn of creation. It was founded by Earth's first rulers and teachers of the path to enlightenment who are known variously as Enki and the Anunnaki, the Sons of God, and as Sanat Kumara and the Kumaras, founders of the Great White Brotherhood. Throughout history the Dragon Court has been situated in Central Asia, Egypt, Sumeria, China, India and Persia, where ancient Dragon Priest Kings ruled over their beloved subjects and taught them the Dragon Mysteries of alchemy and gnosis. In the Eighth Century the Court was founded in France as the House of Anjou by Dragon families known as the De Veres and Plantagenets, and in 1408 it flourished again as the Dragon Court of the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in Hungary. The Dragon Court and Order are currently under the administration of HRH Prince Nicholas de Vere von Drakenberg and situated in Wales and the Duchy of Drakenberg. Its goal is to preserve the Dragon Mysteri es, reunite those of the Dragon Blood, and to assist in the planetary dissemination of the Dragon path to enlightenment during this very important time in the evolution of the human race.

Below is an extract of an interview that took place between Tracy Twyman and De Vere several years ago. Tracy R. Twyman, the former Editor of Dagobert’s Revenge Magazine, has been a recognized expert on occult hi story for more than seven years. She is the author of The Merovingian Mythos and the Mystery of Rennes -le -Chateau, and the editor of The Arcadian Mystique: The Best of Dagobert’s Revenge Magazine (Dragon Key Press, 2005). Her articles have been published i n magazines such as Paranoia and New Dawn, and she has appeared numerous times on radio programs such as Coast to Coast A.M. to discuss her unique and fascinating theories about world history and mythology. TWYMAN : How did you begin research into your fam ily history? At what point in your life did you become aware of \"the Dragon legacy\" in your family? Is it something you grew up with? DE VERE : From the age of seven onwards my father told me about our ancestry, an ancestry steeped in royal blood and most significantly of all, in what is termed Royal Witchcraft, which is a major, ancient, draconian, druidic facet continuing within the later history of the Dragon tradition and within the Vere family. My father educated me about our particular origins in the royal and noble Blackwood family of Lanark, Scotland. This dynasty sired the most significant practitioner of the Dragon tradition in his time: Major Thomas Weir of Vere of Edinburgh, my 11th great grandfather. As a witch lord and the prince consort to the elven queen of the Lallan, Thomas performed the ancient Gaelic rites of the sacred kingship of Epona, and consequently founded this rite of kingship within my lineage. So I received the tradition at an early age from my father and he received it from his father, and so on. TWYMAN : Your formal title is \"Prince Nicholas de Vere.\" What does this title imply?"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 46 DE VERE : I trace my lineage back in an unbroken bloodline to the imperial prince Milo de Vere, Count of Anjou in 740 A.D., son of Princess Milouz iana of the Scythians. She was recorded throughout France as being the Elven, Dragon Princess of the Scottish Picts, and her Grandson, Milo II, derived his Merovingian descent through his father’s marital alliance with the imperial house of Charlene. Later in history we picked up numerous other lines of Merovingian descent and the attitude in the house of Vere today, both here and in Ireland, reflects that of the Merovingians themselves where inheritance and blood descent is concerned. Concerning my maternal lineage: my mother is descended from the ancient Collison Jarls of Norfolk, and is the third cousin of the head of the House of Vere. We are a very tightly knit family. The head of the House himself is of Royal Collison descent and this matrilinear Collison extraction also stems from the ancient House of Vere and Princess Milouziana of the Scythians. We are Veres on all sides of the family. The overall head of the House of Vere today is the Prince Mhaior. By Papal Investiture and by inheritance from the House of the royal O’Brien descendants of King Brian Boru of Tara, the Prince Mhaior is himself an Archduke - not an insignificant Irish earl, as some totally ill -informed malcontent once triumphantly proclaimed in a ridiculous, failed attempt at an exposé of me. TWYMAN : Who are the \"Dragons\" that you write about in your book? DE VERE : In brief, the recorded Dragon lineage starts with the Anunnaki and descends through the proto-Scythians, the Sumerians in one branch and the early Egyptians in another; the Phoenicians, the Mittani, back to the Scythians again through marital alliance, along to the \"Tuatha de Danaan\" and the Fir Bolg; down through their Arch -Druidic, Priest- Princely families, to the Royal Picts of Scotland and the high kings of the Horse Lords of Dal Riada; through to the Elven dynasty of Pendragon and Avallon del Acqs, and down to a few pure bred families today. TWYMAN : Were the Dr agons originally a separate species from what we would call \"human\"? DE VERE : Dragon tradition related to all the current genetic and historical evidence says yes they were. Both relatively recent and ancient accounts of Dragons or Elves going back to the Anunnaki speak of them as having clearly distinct physical attributes, and these attributes are inherited from a species that scientists now assert preceded the human genetic bottleneck by about thirty thousand years. These attributes are not human in the accepted sense. Whether this ancient race was hybridized with another before history is anybody’s guess, but their later hybridization to produce the Elven God-Kings and Ring Lords (the King Tribe), is clearly recorded in the Cylinder Rolls. TWYMAN : Are these Dragons the same as the \"Nephilim\" of the Bible or the \"Watchers\" of The Book of Enoch? DE VERE : The Nephilim and the Watchers are of the Dragon race, yes. TWYMAN : Were the gods of ancient cultures (Greece, India, Sumeria, etc.) Dragons? DE V ERE : These pantheons are derived from one another so again the answer in simplistic terms is yes. TWYMAN : What kind of civilization did the Dragons reign over? Would you say that it was the same as the Atlantean or antediluvian civilization? DE VERE : The Platonic Atlantis theory is preceded by a much older tradition relating to the \"Ogdoad.\" The Ogdoad, sacred to Jesus himself, were the eight great Gods who raked the Sacred Mountain - \"Atlantis\" - after the original Flood. This Flood occurred in the Black Sea and the Sacred Mountain, so"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 47 inundated, was believed to be the Pontus Euxine. Apparently the Ogdoad failed in their attempt to bring fertility back to the Holy Place and abandoned it for a life wandering the planet. This is probably why the legend of the Flood spread and can be found in most cultures. The Ogdoad turn up in Chinese myth, in early Egyptian religious texts, and even in much later Viking legend, where the gods of the Aesir were said to have abandoned the Sacred Mountain after the Flood. From the Ogdoad, who were the first Dragon god-kings of ancient proto-Scythia, we obtain the gods of the Anunnaki, and those later pantheons that derived from them. It is not to be doubted that after the Flood the children of the Anunnaki had established incredible civilizations in their time, so I suppose you could say that the cultures of the Sumerians (whose language, termed \"proto-Sumerian\", originated in Transylvania), the Egyptians and even the early settlers in northern Europe stemm ed from and reflect an antediluvian prototype, a much older pre-Flood \"Golden Age\" presided over by the ancient Dragon god-kings and goddess -queens. The mistake would be to put the Atlantean period too far back in time and to locate Atlantis where Plato di d. Scientists have proved the Biblical Flood to be in the Black Sea and this region is where most of the Titanic and Olympian sagas, associated with the Dawn of the Gods, unfold. TWYMAN: Is Dragon blood the true source of divine right kingship, in your opinion? Are the Dragons the rightful rulers of the world’s governments? DE VERE : Anciently Dragon blood, the blood of the gods, is the true source of divine right kingship. To say that Dragons are the rightful rulers of the world’s governments today might raise some contention. Perhaps it would be more realistic to suggest that they may well be the rightful rulers of the world’s governments in the future. What makes this interview with De Vere fascinating is that very few from these royal bloodlines are willing to share such intimate level of detail about what they believe in such an open public forum. However we would hope that you are now starting to understand that it is an absolute reality that these bloodlines believe that they descended from the An unnaki . The conspirac y behind the Merovingian bloodline is affiliated with alore of occult knowledge that dates back to at least the sixth century BC. This lore begins with a heresy, known as Kabbalah, which disguises itself as Jewish, but is a pact to seek world domination, and the eradication of religion in favour of the worship of Lucifer. The goal devised by these Kabbalists has since been the instal lation of their “messiah” as world leader, who, according to their interpretation of the Bible, is to be of line of King David. Since that time, to preserve this purported lineage, until the advent of their expected leader, these Luciferians have been carefully intermarrying amongst each other, and have included among them many of the leading figures of history. They begin with a Persian Royal family, who intermarried with that of Alexander the Great. By combining with that of Herod the Great, these famil ies were responsible for the creation and dissemination of the leading mystery school of the Roman Empire, the Mysteries of Mithras, which eventually succeeded in co-opting the emerging Christian movement, by producing Catholic Christianity. Nevertheless, a secret, or Gnostic, version of Christianity, also derived from Mithraism, survived to compete with Catholicism, in the form of several secret societies, like the Templars, Rosicrucians and Freemasons, practicing occult arts, or what is known as “witchcraft”. This tradition was perpetuated by the most popularized branch of the Luciferian bloodline, the Merovingians."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 48 Symbolized by the Holy Grail, the Merovingians, after intermarrying into the family of a Jewish Exilarch, or claimant to the Jewish thron e, culminated in all the lead ing families of the Crusades. It was at this time that this European branch of the family recombined with others from Eastern Europe and Armenia. These Eastern aristocracies derived from the enigmatic Khazars, who had populated southern Russia and the Basin of the Don River, and who, in the eighth century AD, had converted to Judaism. Legend has it, however, that the Khazars were remnants of the Lost Tribes. Armenia, just across the Caucasus, was another locale of these suppos ed Lost Tribes. It was the intermarriage and perpetuation of these aristocratic bloodlines that were being referred to in the heraldic symbols of the lily, the rose, the double-headed eagle, and the skull and crossbones. Also during the Crusades, this network connected with an important occult center hiding within the Islamic world, in Cairo Egypt, who followed the heretical version of Islam known as Ismailism. According to Masonic legend, a number of these “Eastern Brethren” were rescued and brought to Scotland, where they provided the basis of Scottish Rite Freemasonry, which emerged in the eighteenth century. However, at the same time, this legend also provided the basis for the establishment of Freemasonry in Egypt, which then became the second center of Illuminati activism. It was from these secret networks of Islamic impostors by which the Western powers created Islamic terrorism, used to foment of a Clash of Civilizations, through the fabrication of the terrorist threat. The term “Merovingian” is said to derive from Merovee who was King of the Franks from 447-458 A.D. From the 5th to the 8th centuries, the Merovingian dynasty of kings ruled Europe and, from the Middle Ages until the present day, most of Europe's monarchs have been of Merovingian lineage. The most famous of all Merovingian rulers, though, was Merovee’s grandson, Clovis I, 40 who reigned between 481 and 511 AD. Gaul was the richest and largest area of the western empire, but The Frankish tribes 37 had not succeeded in organizing a single state, until Clovis defeated the surviving Roman forces in 486 AD. During his reign and that of his sons, Frankish power was extended over nearly all of Gaul and far into Germany. The Frankish kingdom eventually becam e the strongest and most extensive of the new German states, and it was the only one that truly survived into later centuries, and from it were descended the modern states of both Germany and France. “Meroveus” derives from the French words “mer” meaning “sea” and “vere” meaning “werewolf” or “dragon The demonic origins and history of the Merovingian Dynasty also known as the Dragon are revealed in less available insider sources such as Gardner’s Realm of the Ring Lords and “Kenneth Grant and the Merovingian Mythos” published by DragonKey Press. “...The ancient people of the Tuatha De Danann...were the supernatural tribe of the pre- Achaean agricultural goddess Danae of Argos, or perhaps of the Aegean mother -goddess, Danu. But their true name rendered in i ts older form was Tuadhe d’Anu. As such, they were the people (or tribe) of Anu, the great sky god of the Anunnaki.” 19 “...the Merovingian race was sired by a water beast known as the Quinotaur. This Quinotaur took the form of a sea -bull. Crowley’s personal seal was of a sea goat. Grant, writing of Crowley’s Seal of the Beast , says: ‘The beast is the sea- goat or amphibious monster identical with Cthulhu, the Quinotaure or Bull of the Deep.’ Grant writes as a footnote; ‘The waters under the earth; home of the ‘ancestors’ or subconscious atavisms of the race.’ Is this a refe rence to the race of the Grail?” 19 "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 49 Merovingian claims of angelic ancestry may seem too bizarre to be true, however, as mentioned above, such a race of demonic origin is found in Scripture in reference to the Nephilim. The Hebrew word nephiyl is properly translated fallen ones and refers to the offspring of fallen angels who mated with human women on Mount Hermon in the land of Canaan. It may be that “after that” in Gen. 6:4 refers to a second invasion of fallen angels after the flood, which would explain why the Israelites found giants (Nephilim) in Canaan upon entry into the Promised Land: “And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and s o we were in their sight.”(Num. 13:33, Hebrew Masoretic Text, Hebrew -English JPS 1917 Ed.) Some commentators have speculated that the Nephilim of Numbers 13 belonged to a second eruption of fallen angels, since the earlier Nephilim had been destroyed in the Flood. And they see an allusion to this in Genesis 6:4, where it states that ‘there were Nephilim in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men.’ Could it be that the ‘after that’ was a reference to the Nephilim found in Canaan during the Israelite entry into the land? If so, it could explain why the Lord commanded the total extermination of the Canaanites, as he had earlier ordered the near annihilation of the human race.” Sodom and Gomorrah were Canaanite settlements that practiced cult prostitution in conjunction with their fertility rites. Jude 7 suggests that the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were so depraved that fornication with angels was practiced, as the record of Genesis 19 also attests. “And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” (Jude 6 -7) The Illuminati claim descent from the Fallen Angels, from whom they supposedly learned the “Ancient Wisdom”, also known as the Kabbalah. These “Fallen Angels” are referred to in the Bible, Book of Genesis, as the Nephilim, or “Sons of God”, and were said to have descended to earth and intermarried with human beings. Christian interpretations sometimes struggle with the passage, choosing to translate the term into “mighty men”. However, apocryphal Jewish texts explain that they were the Lucifer and his legions, who were cast out of Heaven, and took wives from the female descendants of Cain. They produced a race, according to the Bible, known as the Anakim. According to the Illuminati, it is these other -worldly beings who first introduced humanity to the occult arts, including astrology, magic and alchemy. This account of history is believed by occultists to accord with that of the lost continent of Atlantis, and that the race produced by the intermixing of these Fallen Angels and humans is thought to be the Aryans. Their corruption caused great corruption on the earth, to such an extent that, according to these same Apocryphal works, God decided to destroy them through the Flood. According to the Bible, wickedness soon returned to the earth, however, when Noah’s son Ham committed a sin. Ham moved southwest into Africa and parts of the near Middle East, and was the forefather of the nations there. From Ham’s son, Mizraim, came the Egyptians, from Phut, the Lybians, and from Kush, came the Kushites, who established Ethiopia. Cush was also the father of Nimrod, the legendary founder of the ancient city of Babylon, who was responsible for instigating the building of the Tower of Babel. Supposedly, Shem, Ham’s brother, and Cush’s great uncle, became appalled by his nephew’s evil deeds, and killed Nimrod. Before his death, however, Nimrod had marri ed and impregnated his own mother, named Semiramis."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 50 After Nimrod was slain, Semiramis instituted the worship of herself and her son among the people of Babylon, who came to regard Nimrod as a sun-god, and she was a goddess, or Queen of Heaven. Nimrod, or Bel, as he was later worshipped by the Babylonians, was also identified with the constellation of Orion, the shepherd of the stars, mythologized as a hunter by the Greeks, and therefore referred to mystically in the Bible as “a mighty hunter before the Lor d”. Semiramis, later revered as Ishtar, was identified with the planet Venus, as were all the goddesses modelled after her. Nimrod was confronted in his blasphemy by Abraham, the founder of the Jewish nation, who left his own nation of star -worshippers, in Harran, to found a new religion. That religion, centred around the worship of a single transcendent God, and the practice of justice and compassion towards one’s fellow man, became known as Judaism. Abraham’s grandson Jacob, later Israel, had twelve s ons, from whom were descended the Twelve Tribes of Israel. However, later, in the Bible, through the influence of the Kabbalah, these tribes acquired mystical symbolism, which would eventually become the prominent features of European heraldry. Like the astrological zodiac, these twelve tribes were divided into four camps of three, in accordance with the four seasons of the Zodiac, divided according to the Four Elements. Thus, Reuben, who is compared to running water, with Simeon and Gad, are Aquarius. J udah, the lion, with Issachar and Zebulon, are Leo. Benjamin, Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Jacob compares to the ox, are Taurus. Naphtali, Asher and Dan, whose device is the scorpion, synonymous astrologically with the eagle, are Scorpio. The brothers tried to kill their sibling Joseph, by dropping him into a well, but he was later rescued, and eventually became a governor in Egypt. When the Israelites were stricken with famine, they were forced to seek the assistance of Joseph in Egypt, who finally reveal ed himself to his treacherous brothers. After four hundred years in Egypt, the increasing number of Israelites in the country began to concern Pharaoh, who oppressed them. Moses was sent by God to revive the monotheistic religion of Abraham among the Is raelites, and lead them to the land promised to their forefather, in what is known as the Covenant. For according to the Bible, God had chosen the Jewish people above other nations, to follow His commandments. After confronting Pharaoh, Moses successfully acquired permission to lead his people out of the land. However, a short time after the Israelites had cross the Red Sea, and while Moses was away on Mount Sinai receiving the tablets of the Ten Commandments, they blasphemed by constructing a statue of a Golden Calf from their melted Jewelry. Scholars acknowledge that this cow -god was borrowed from the Apis Bull of the Egyptians, who was equated with Osiris. More accurately, Osiris and Isis were merely the Egyptian versions of the same couple worshipped in Babylon originally as Nimrod and Semiramis. Moses ordered the Seventy Elders to slay the idolaters, and the tribe continued its journey to the Promised Land, where they were ordered to conquer the inhabitants. According to Kabbalistic legend, it was to these Seventy that Moses had originally revealed the secret doctrine. These Seventy would become the origin for the foundation of the Sanhedrin, a legislative council that would later govern the Israelites, until their defeat at the hands of the Romans. And Moses, like his brother Aaron, was from the tribe of Levi, and the generations of priests that claimed descent from him, known as Kohanim, or Cohens, were therefore Levites as well. Palestine was then inhabited by the descendants of Ham’s fourth s on, Canaan. According to the Bible, although it was Ham who had sinned, it was upon his son Canaan and his descendants that a curse would fall. According to occult interpretation, however, the Canaanites represented survivors of the Anakim. In Deuteronomy 9:1-2, we read: “Hear, O Israel! You are crossing over the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, great cities fortified to heaven, a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, “Who can stand before the sons of Anak?” "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 51 The Israelites eventually succeeded in taking hold of the land of Palestine, but soon faltered into the worship of pagan gods. According to the Bible, the Israelites were told repeatedly not to intermarry with the Canaanites, nor to worship their idols. Despite these warnings, not only do the early Israelites intermarry extensively with their subjects, but adopt their pagan ways, by worshipping Baal and Astarte, the Canaanite versions of Nimrod and S emiramis. Though known by different names to different peoples, this dying-god and goddess shared common characteristics. They were consistently identified with the Sun, who in winter journeyed “beneath” the earth, into the Underworld. They were therefore believed to “die”, and to resurrect in spring, corresponding to the Christian Easter. Because Baal and his sister Astarte, were regarded as twins, as well married to each other, they were identified as a single androgynous god, symbolized by Venus, whose original Latin name was Lucifer. Therefore, through intermarriage with the Canaanites, the later Kabbalists could claim descent from the Anakim, and the Fallen Angels, or Lucifer and his legions. These Anakim , supposedly, were the original inhabitants of Atlantis, or Aryans. The Aryans are considered by the Illuminati to be the original core bloodline, a hybrid of humans and “divine” beings, responsible for the preservation of occult knowledge. According to modern historians, influenced by Kabbalistic legend, these Aryans, also known as Indo- Europeans, survived the Flood, or sinking of Atlantis, and found refuge in the mountains of As ia. From there they emerged to conquer the known peoples, spreading their customs and language to Central Asia, Iran, or Persia, and into Europe. The Canaanite territory of northern Israel was later occupied by the tribe of Dan, whose worship of Baal/Pan involved such fertility rites at Mount Hermon, also called Mount Sion. The Mer ovingians are the offspring of the tribe of Dan which intermarried with the Canaanite Tuatha De Danann, also known as the Dragon Lords of Anu because they were the offspring of the fallen angels (Anunnaki). Through the work of Sir Laurence Gardener we discover that Sumaire in the old Irish language means Dragon . He writes: “It is also reckoned that the subsequent culture of the region, phonetically called Sumerian (pronounced ‘Shumerian’) was actually Sidhem urian (Shee -murian). This case is now considerable since the early Ring Lords of Scythia (the Tuatha De Danaan king tribe) were actually called the ‘ Sumaire .” 20 When God dispersed the northern tribes of Israel for their wickedness, the tribe of Dan migrated to Greece, and later to France and the British Isles where they established pagan priesthoods and royal dynasties of the demonic bloodline. The Tuatha De Danann (or Dragon Lords of Anu)...[before settling in Ireland (from about 800 B.C.)]...were the...Black Sea princes of Scythia (now Ukraine). Like the original dynastic Pharaohs, they traced their descent from the great Pendragons of Mesopotamia; from them sprang the kingly lines of the Irish Bruithnigh and the Picts of Scotland’s Caledonia. In Wales they founded the Royal House of Gwynedd, while in Cornwall in the southwest of England, they were the sacred gentry known as Pict- Sidhe. “So, from a single caste of the original Blood Royal - whether known as the Sangréal , the Albi -gens or the Ring Lords - we discover many of the descriptive terms which sit at the very heart of popular folklore. For here, in this one noble race, we have the ‘elves’, ‘fairies’ and ‘pixies’ - not beguiling little folk, but distinguished Kings and Queens of the Dragon suc cession.” 21 In ‘The Psalter of Cashel’ it states that: ‘The Tuatha de Danaan’ ruled in Ireland for about two centuries, and were highly skilled in architecture and other arts from their long residence in Greece.’ The Tuatha de Danaan were the descendants of Danaus, the son of Belus, who went with his fifty daughters to Argos, the home of his ancestrous"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"PARATECHNOLOGY PART 2: SUMERIA - THE 21 ST CENTURY MIRROR PARATECHNOLOGY A PRODUCTION OF REMA MARKETING AND WWW.GLOBALREPORT2010.COM ©2012, All rights reserved 52 Io. In Irish legends the Tuatha de Danaan, who were considered to be demi -gods,...were said to have possessed a... Grail -like vessel... These teachers of w isdom...were the founders of the Druidic priesthood.” 22 The priestly Merovingian kings were not pagan in any sense of being unenlightened. Their spiritual cult was very much related to that of the Druids (Celtic), and they were greatly revered as esoteric teachers, judges, faith healers and clairvoyants. Not only were they akin to the early Nazarites, but they retained many other customs from Biblical times and also from the Essene traditions in which Jesus was raised. Their culture seemed, however, to hav e appeared from out of nowhere. The Merovingian kings were occult adepts, initiates in arcane sciences, practitioners of esoteric arts? worthy rivals or equivalents of Merlin, having gained much of their occult knowledge through the Atlantean remnants who had escaped its destruction by moving to the Pyrenees on the Spanish-French border, the mountain range not far from the Merovingian territory of southern France. Merovingians, in fact, were often called sorcerer kings, a legacy whi ch speaks for itself. They were also said to bear a distinctive birthmark, a red cross, either over the heart or between the shoulder the front or the rear of the body's heart chakra. The Merovingians were regarded as priest-kings, embodiments of the divine. They did not rule simply by God's grace, but were apparently deemed the living embodiment and incarnation of God's grace? a status usually reserved for Jesus.
