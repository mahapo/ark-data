Ana’kh words in Semitic and ancient non-Semitic languages ________________ I. Definition and introduction:Ana’kh is the language of the Anunnaki who descended on Sumeria and Phoeniciaaccording to the Ulema.It is of an extraterrestrial origin. Ulema Al Bakr stated that it was used byearly human beings who lived on the Island of Arwad, in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos andMu. He added that from the Ana’kh derived the primitive languages of the NearEast and the Middle East.Ana’kh was never made public. It remained a secret language known only to theUlema, and later on to the Allamah.It sounds Semitic, because of its phonetics. But it is “not Semitic at all”,said Ulema Ghandar Gupta. It has no grammar, but it has an extremely richvocabulary and an abundance of metaphoric expressions.Another Ulema said, that the original name of Jehovah or Yahweh derived from theAnakh word Yaw. Also, a considerable number of Akkadian and Sumerian words thatappeared in the Sumerian Epic of Creation and the Bible derived from Ana’kh.Around 569 A.D., a group of Ulema (Munawareen) in the Near East (Non-Islamicscholars) compiled an extensive list of Ana’kh words and phrases.In 625, A.D., two leading figures of the Ulema brotherhood wrote the Book ofRama-Dosh; a compilation of Ana’kh terminology, a lexicon, and Kiraats(Readings). Ulema AL Bakr stated that the Ulema are not member of a religiousgroup. They are neither Muslim nor members of any organized religion.In fact, they were persecuted by the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, andwere expelled from the Arab Peninsula. They found refuge in Cyprus andMarseille.But the honorable Ulema was quick to point out that the early Sufi masters,poets and Sufi trance dancers were Ulema.He added that Ulema should not be confused with the Islamic Ulema who teachIslamic law, or with the Allamah who were the leading Islamic figures of scienceand letters in medieval times.Farid Tayarah, an Ulema himself, and a former head of a Masonic Lodge statedthat the Ana’kh was used during Masonic sessions and services. He added that aconsiderable number of Masonic words and expressions are pure Ana’kh, especiallythose words referring to levels and degrees in Freemasonry, and initiationceremonies.Many of the original words of this language, as well as numerous linguisticderivations are included in this book.Explore it in this book.But approach it with an open mind, and an open heart. II. A specimen of the Ana’kh language:A specimen of the Ana’kh language, taken from the Book of Ramadosh. Below is anexcerpt from an Ana’kh text on Genesis, I translated decades ago:Genesis according to the Book of Rama Dosh.The Anunnaki maintain that the universe was created from a molecule smaller thanthe tip of a pin, taking less than three seconds. The language is metaphoric,the science is highly visible - much like our own Genesis whose language coversthe Big Bang and the Theory of Evolution. a- Transliteration of an Ana’kh text from the Book of Ramadosh:1 .Inna bida rama dosh kali kilmawa falki uzzu ina wa anru dani (Dounia)2 .u rama dosh khalki shama u erdi3 .wa erdi naya shak-lu fari mara anu absiu rama dosh liwa basra erdi4 .u rama dosh shadah ilmu erdi rou'a min bashri5 .u rama dosh khalka belti isama shavah6 .wa leilu wa fagru subhi yomou badri.7 .u hawwa marki-ya kila la-ma nazri.

In the beginning, Rama Dosh spoke the Word and the universe burst into beingand was ready for life.2 . And Rama Dosh created the heaven and the earth.3 . And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face ofthe deep. And only Rama Dosh could see the earth.4 . And Rama Dosh wanted to know what the earth would look like if it were seenby humans.5 . And Rama Dosh created a female human from their own essence, and called herChavah. In their own image, in the image of Rama Dosh, created they Chavah.6 . And the evening and the morning were the first day.7 . And Chavah was confused, and said, I cannot see. So Rama Dosh said, I shallposition the earth not far from the sun, and there will be light: and there waslight. And Chavah saw that it was good.8 . And Chavah was not hungry, since her body was not yet complete, but she wasthirsty. So Rama Dosh said, Let the water under the heaven be gathered togetherunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and so it was, and Chavah saw thatit was good.9 . And Chavah could not drink, so Rama Dosh made the water go up in steam soChavah could breathe it, and that was the air, and Chavah saw that it was good.10 . And the evening and the morning were the second day.11 . And Chavah was bored. So Rama Dosh said, Let the earth bring forth grass,the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind: and soit was, and Chavah saw that it was good.12 . And Chavah, for her body was not as yet complete, could fly all over theearth. And she moved upon the face of the water and the earth and all the greenthings. And Chavah saw that it was good.13 . And Chavah was bored again, and Rama Dosh were angry with her and made hersleep. And while she slept, still they realized that she was bored because shewas all alone upon the earth, and Rama Dosh knew that she was right. And RamaDosh said, it is not good that the woman should be alone.We will make her a help meet for her.14 . And the evening and the morning were the third day.15 . And while Chavah slept, Rama Dosh took a part of her body, and parts fromthe dirt of the earth, and parts of the water, and mixed them into clay. Andthey put the clay next to Chavah, and they breathed upon the clay, and it becamea man, but he looked like Chavah, and Rama Dosh knew that this was not good.16 . And Rama Dosh pointed Their finger at the sleeping man, and They touchedhim, and the man changed and no longer looked like Chavah, but like a man. AndRama Dosh named the man Zakar, and commanded him to wake up: and he woke up.17 . And Rama Dosh commanded Chavah to wake up, and she saw the man, and sheknew that it was good. III. Ana’kh words in Semitic and ancient non-Semitic languages:The Anunnaki’s language had a major linguistic and epistemological influence onthe languages of the ancient world, as well as upon the civilization, cultureand religions of the ancient Near and Middle East, including but not limited tothe Phoenicians, Sumerians, Assyrians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Mesopotamians,Copts, Hittites, Egyptians, Arabs, and Hebrews.Many of the Ana’kh words entered the early languages of those civilizations, andfrom the original Ana’kh, derived thousands of ancient Semitic and non-Semiticwords and expressions, some very noticeable in Akkadian/Sumerian epics such asthe Epic of Gilgamesh, and Enuma Elish, as well as in the Epic of the PhoenicianCosmogony. For instance:> • 1 -The Ana’kh word “ Ab”, meaning father became Ab in Arabic, Abu and Abuya> in Aramaic, Abba in Hittite, so on.> > • 2 -The Ana’kh word A girim, means first baked clay.Composed of two words:a-A, which means first,b-Girim, which means clay.From Agirim, derived the Sumerian, Babylonian, and Akkadian word Girim (Clay). > • 3 - The Ana’kh word A-kel means food.From A-kel, derived the Sumerian Akalum, and the Arabic Akel, which mean food. > • 4 -The Ana’kh word Amamu, means a front.From Amamu, derived the Arabic word Amam, which means ahead; in front, and theAkkadian/Sumerian word Elamu, which means front. > • 5 -The Ana’kh word Amram, means good subjects of the Anunnaki’s leaders;> good union; highly developed communities.Composed of two words :> • a -Am (Good; kind.)> • b -Ram (People; community; population; tribe.)In Biblical studies, Amram means high people; kindred of the High; friend ofJehovah.In primitive Arabic, Ram meant: People; group. Henceforth, the name of thePalestinian city Ramallah could be interpreted as the people of God, since Allahmeans to the Arabs and Muslims, what exactly the word Jehovah means to the Jews:God.When Enki or Ea called upon Avraham, he told him: I am your god, and I am nowchanging your name from Av-raham to Ab-Raham, because you are going to lead mypeople as the father of my people on earth. Av became Ab. And Ab in all the 14different ancient languages of the Near East and the Middle East means father.From the Ana’kh Ab, derived the words: Ab, Abu, Abi, Aba, Abba, Abuya, Abouna;all meaning the very same thing: Father. And from the Ana’kh word ram, derivedthe ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic word Ram: People.Centuries later, Ram acquired a multitude of meanings.For instance:> • a -In ancient Hebrew, Ram is pleasing.> • b -In Sanskrit mythology, Ram means supreme.> • c -In the pre-Islamic Arabic era, called Al-Gahiliya “Jahiliya” (Years of> darkness), Ram meant a group of people. Synonym: Ra’bh.From the Ana’kh Ram, we have today, the Arabic Ramy and the Spanish Ramos. Inancient times, the early Armenians called themselves the people of Ram.“They recognized themselves as the People of the Ram and their supreme deity wasKhal-di . Thus was derived the land of the original Khaldini , later corruptedby Greeks in the times of Achaemenian to Chaldea . (Source: The Ark of Noah,David Fasold.

From Dihbi, derived the Assyrian adjective> Dihbina, which means golden, and the Arabic noun Dahab, wich means gold. > • 48 - The Ana’kh word Duru, “Diri”, “Dariya”: A community center; a meeting> place; official edifice.From the Ana’kh words, derived the Phoenician words Dar, Fidar, and Dir whichmean a house. From the Phoenician words, derived the Aramaic word Dayra, whichmeans a monastery. Originally a convent for Aramaic, Syriac and Maronite monksand priests in the Near and Middle East.From the Aramaic word, derived the Arabic Pre-Islamic word Dayr “Deir”(Monastery) which means the same thing in ancient and modern Arabic. > • 49 - The Ana’kh word Emim: Ana’kh/Sumerian/Hebrew. Name given to the> children of Anak. The Bible referred to them as the offspring of the giants> and the women of earth. They are the corrupted offspring of the Anakim.Here are some excerpts from the Bible:> • Jos: 11:21: “And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakim from the> mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of> Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly> with their cities.”> • Jos: 11:22: “There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children> of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained…”> • Jos: 14:12: “Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spoke in> that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and that> the cities were great and fenced: if so be the Lord will be with me, then I> shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.”> • Jos: 14:15: “And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a> great man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.” > • 50- The Ana’kh word En: The ultimate lord. From the Ana’kh En, derived the> Sumerian and Akkadian word En (Lord). > • 51 - The Ana’kh word “E-zakar-erdi” (Azakar.Ki): Ana’kh/Ulemite. Term for> the “Inhabitants of Earth” as named by the Anunnaki, and mentioned in the> Ulemite language in the “Book of Rama-Dosh.”Per contra, extraterrestrials are called Ezakarfalki.“Inhabitants of Heaven or Sky”. The term or phrase “Inhabitants of Earth” refersonly to humans, because animals and sea creatures are called Ezbahaiim-erdi. Ezakarerdi is composed of three words:> • 1 -E (Pronounced Eeh or Ea) means first.> • 2 -Zakar: This is the Akkadian/Sumerian name given to Adam by Enki. The same> word is still in use today in Arabic, and it means male. In Arabic, the female> is called: Ountha (Oonsa). It also means:> • a -A male, and sometime a stud.> • b -To remember. In Hebrew, “Zakar” also means:> • a -T o remember (Qal in Hebrew).> • b -Be thought of (Niphal in Hebrew).> • c -Make remembrance (Hiphil in Hebrew). There is a very colorful linguistic jurisprudence in the Arabic literature thatexplains the hidden meaning of the word “Zakar”; Arabs in general believe thatman (Male) remembers things, while women generally tend to forget almosteverything, thus was born the Arabic name for a woman “Outha or Oonsa”, whichmeans literally “To forget!”Outha (Oonsa) either derives from or coincides with the words “Natha”, “Nasa”,“Al Natha”, “Nis-Yan”, which all mean the very same thing: Forgetting; toforget, or not to remember.On a theological level, Islamic scholars explain that the faculty of rememberingis a sacred duty for the Muslim, because it geared him toward remembering thatAllah (God) is the creator.Coincidently or not, Zakar in Ana’kh (Anunnaki language) and ancientBabylonian-Sumerian means also to remember. Could it be a hint or an indicationfor Adam’s duty of remembering Enki, his creator?> • 3 -Erdi means planet Earth. Erdi was transformed by scribes into Ki in the> Akkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian epics.From Erd, derived:> • a -The Sumerian Ersetu and Erdsetu,> • b -The Arabic Ard,> • c -The Hebrew Eretz.All sharing the same meaning: Earth; land.Thus the word Ezakarerdi means verbatim: The first man (Or Created one) of Earthor the first man on Earth, or simply, the Earth-Man. In other word, theterrestrial human. > • 52 - The Ana’kh word Gabhatimani: The reader of galactic maps; the decipher> of codes. (Source: The Book of Rama-Dosh). From Gabhatimani, derived the> Sanskrit word Gabhastiman, which means re possessed of his rays. > • 53- The Ana’kh word Gab’r: Ana’kh/Ulemite/Arabic. A reference made to a> multitude of meanings at linguistic, religious, and metaphysical levels. Most> commonly associated with Angel Gabriel. The word “Gab-r” was phonetically> pronounced Gab’er.The early Arabs adopted it as “Al Jaber” meaning many things including: force,authority, might, governing. From “Al Jaber” important words, nouns andadjectives derived. For instance, the word “Jabbar” means: mighty, powerful,capable, huge, giant, like the giants (Nephilim, Anakim, Anunnaki) mentioned inthe Bible and in the Akkadian, Babylonian and Sumerian epics.Jababira is the plural of “Jabbar”.After the Arabs were converted to Islam, “Al Jaber” became “Al Jabbar”, one ofthe attributes and names of Allah (God).In Ana’kh, the word “Jabba-r-oout” means exactly the same thing in early Aramaicand modern Arabic: Authority, power, rule, reign. It is so obvious that theAna’kh language deeply influenced Eastern and Western languages.We find striking similarity in our Western vocabularies (Latin, Anglo-Saxon,French and Romance languages); Gab’r became gouverneur in French, governor inEnglish, and gubernator in Latin.The Sumerian Gabriel was also known under different names according to theSumerian texts, such as “Nin-Hour-sagh”, meaning the lady governess of themountain, an elevated region of the Garden of Eden. Gabriel as a female Anunnakiwas the first to experiment with copies of a human, later to be called Adamah,Adamu, Adam.As defined in the “Anunnaki Encyclopedia”; Gab’r (Ga’r) is a n Anunnakipersonage with mighty powers and major influence on the creation of the humanrace.From Gab’r (Ga’r), derived the Hebrew word Gabriel (Angel Gabriel). And theArabic equivalent Gib-rail (Girayel, Gib-ra’il). 54 -The Ana’kh word Gabra’il “Gabriel”: Ana’kh/Ulemite.Name of an Anunnaki personage with mighty powers, who has played a major andprimordial role in the creation of the human race. It is composed of two words:a -Gab or Gabra, which means strength, power, might.b -Il (El), which means god, creator, master, lord.Thus, the meaning becomes the creative power. In other words, the person who hasthe power to create. In this context, creation of Man is very a propos .Gabra’il “Gabriel” was also called “Nin-il” and “Nin-ti”.In Ana’kh, Sumerian and Babylonian languages, the word “Ti” means “rib”.“Nin-ti” also means the “Lady of the rib”, “Lady of life”, and the “Lady ofcreation”. Gabriel is also called “Gab” and “Gab-r-il”. Gab means a femaleguardian, a governor or a protector. This explains why and how Angel Gabriel wasdepicted in the Scriptures as the guardian of the Garden of Eden.In ancient texts of the Sumerians, Akkadians and civilizations of neighboringcountries in the Near and Middle East, “Gab-r” was the governor of “Janat Adan.”In various Semitic languages, “Janat” means paradise and/or a garden, and Edenis Idin, Edin, and Adan, and it means high or elevated. The Hebrew word Ganwhich means a garden, derived from the Assyrian and Aramaic words Gan, Ganta andGentaa, which mean park, garden. This is how we got Garden of Eden, from TheAssyrian/Proto-Aramaic Gentaa Edeen.The Sumerian-Anunnaki Gabriel ( Gab’r, Ga’br) is more than a guardian, becausehe/she was called Nin-Ti which means verbatim: Life-Woman. In other words, AngelGabriel was three things:> • 1 -Governor of the Garden of Eden;> • 2 -A woman, not a man, because she was described as the female who created> life;> • 3 -A geneticist who worked on the human DNA and genetically created the> human race.The word “Gab-r” was phonetically pronounced as: Gab’er.The early Arabs adopted it as “Al Jaber” meaning many things including force,authority, might, and governing. From “Al Jaber” numerous words, nouns andadjectives were derived. For instance, the word “Jabbar” means: mighty,powerful, capable, huge, giant. Gabriel as a female Anunnaki was the firstgoddess to experiment with copies of humans created from clay found in ancientIraq. During the first genetic experiment, Gabriel created 7 different types ofHomo sapiens by using the DNA of primitive beings and the DNA of an Anunnaki.Gabriel’s original creations were not very successful. Later on, Gabriel used amost unexpected genetic source to create the final copy of the modern man.He/she mixed the blood of an Igigi (Extraterrestrial God) with earth’s clay tocreate a quasi-human life form, to be called Adamah. According to Ana’khcosmogony, Adam, the Man, was created from the rib of Gabriel, the femaleAnunnaki; the “lady of the rib”.This, of course, contradicts the story of the creation of Adam and Eve as toldin the Judeo-Christian tradition. According to the Ana’kh literature, a womancreated man; it was not a man who created a woman (Eve). And the female Anunnaki(Gabriel) used her rib to create Adam. > • 55 - The Ana’kh word Gens “Jenesh”: A gender. Similar words appeared in> Semitic languages. To name a few:> • a -Gens in Arabic;> • b -Gensa in Assyrian;> • c -Gensu in Akkadian. > • 56 - The Ana’kh word Gholobo: To dominate; to overcome. Globo in Aramaic,> and it means to beat. From Ghlobo derived the Arabic verb Ghalab (He/she won),> and the Arabic words Ghalb (Victory), and Ghaleb (A winner). > • 57 - The Ana’kh word Ghoolim: A non-physical duplicate of the physical body> as projected in the air. More precisely, a holographic picture of the dead> body, short after death. From Ghoolim, derived the proto-Arabic word Ghool,> which literally means demoniac spirits-beings haunting those who visit> cemeteries. > • 58- The Ana’kh word Giabiru: Death; a dead person lost in a parallel> dimension. From Giabiru, derived the Assyrian noun Giabi, which means a> reaper. It did appear in the Akkadian and Sumerian clay tablets.“Matani sabzute va malki aibi-su kima giabi uhazizu.”-From the Annals ofSardanapalus. Translated verbatim: “Countries turbulent and kings his enemieslike a reaper he cut off.” > • 59- The Ana’kh word Gibbori: A group of Anunnaki geneticists and people of> science who develop DNA sequences, and alter the genes of hybrids. From> Gibbori, derived the Arabic word Gabbar which means giants, and the plural> Gababira (Giants).In Pre-Islamic era, the word Gababira meant huge entities who came from anon-physical world, and maliciously interfered in humans’ affairs.In Hebrew, it is Gibborim ( גּבּר גּבּור ), which is the plural of Geber, whichmeans mighty man. It appears more than 150 times in the Jewish Tanakh.According to the Theosophical Secret Doctrine, Gibborim refers to theantediluvian giants or Atlanteans, the fourth root-race of mankind. In the fifthroot-race they became known as the kabiri -- the early mighty men of wisdom.(Source: SD 2:273). According to the occult and esoteric Ufology literature, thedemons are the disembodied spirits of the Gibborim, who are the “Mighty Men ofRenown”, created by the Watchers when they left their heavenly abode and camedown to the daughters of men and produced the 'Mighty Men of Renown' as recordedin Genesis Chapter 6:4 of the Old Testament.They are half breeds, angelic hybrids. When fallen angels shape-shift into afrom of human being they can have intercourse but not without some aberrantgenetic changes. The union of these beasts with humans produced children thatwere different in many ways. The first apparent difference was that theydeveloped giantism. They were giants. Og the King of Bashan had a bed that was13 to 15 feet long; and Goliath was 6 cubits tall (9 feet) and they had sixfingers and toes. > • 60 - The Ana’kh word Gibishi: Power. From Gibishi, derived the Assyrian word> Gibis, which means might; power; strength. It did appear in the Akkadian and> Sumerian clay tablets. “Mili kassa mee rabuti kima gibis tihamti> usalmi.”-Nebuchadnezzar. Translated verbatim: “A collection of great water> like the might of the sea I caused add it.”“In gibis libbi-ya u suskin galli-ya er asibi.”-From the Annals of Sardanapalus.Translated verbatim: “In the strength of my heart, and steadfastness of myservants, I besieged the city.”“Ana gibis ummani-su mahdi ittagil.”-From the Obelisk of Nimrud. Translatedverbatim: “To the powers of his great army he trusted.”“”Ina gibis emuqi sa Asur bil-ya.”-From the Annals of Tiglath Pileser.Translated verbatim: “In the boubdless might of Assur my lord.” > • 61 - The Ana’kh word Gibsut- sar: A leading group in charge of military> operations. Usually, the group consists of five persons, men and women> selected from Ma’had, an Ana’kh word meaning an academy. Similar Assyrian word> Gibsut-sun appeared in Iraq’s ancient clay tablets. In Assyrian, Gibsut-sun> means “all of them”, referring to groups and gatherings.“Kitru rabu iktera itti-su gibsut-sun uruh Akkadi izbatunu.”-From aSennacherib’s cylinder. Translated verbatim: “A great gathering was gathered,and with him all of them the road of Akkad took.” > • 62 - The Ana’kh word Gigur: A shield; a cover; roof of an edifice.From Gigur, derived the Assyrian word Gigu, which means a cover; a roof. It didappear in the Akkadian and Sumerian clay tablets. “Sillulat gigu kima antir annanashira gimir babani.”From the Annals of Esar Haddon. Translated verbatim:“Stairs and roof like defenses of metal I placed about all the gates.” > • 63 -The Ana’kh word Gih: Near. From Gih, derived the Assyrian word Gi, which> means near. It did appear in the Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets.“Tarbit zippati gi suqi sa Kirib nahrAgamme ksid.”-From the slabs ofSennacherib.Translated verbatim: “Trees growth of the streams and marshes, which near thelakes I obtained.” > • 64- The Ana’kh word Gilgoolim : The non-physical state of a deceased person,> at the end of the 40 days period. At that time, the deceased person must> decide whether to stay in the lower level of the Fourth dimension, or head> toward a higher level of knowledge, following an extensive orientation> program/guidance.From Gilgoolim, derived the Kabalistic/Hebrew word Gilgoolem referring to thecycle of rebirths, meaning the revolution of souls; the whirling of the soulafter death, which finds-no rest until it reaches its final destination.But in the Jewish literature and teachings, the final destination is the land ofPalestine, the “Promised land”.The Jewish tradition was clearly influenced by the Anunnaki’s concept asinterpreted by the Anunnaki-Ulema in the “Book of Ramadosh.”Later on, Christianity adopted the same concept in its theology and catechism. > • 65 -The Ana’kh word Ginidu: An enemy.From Ginidu, derived the Assyrian/Akkadian word Gini, which means enemies.It did appear in the Akkadian and Assyrian tablets. “Usanqitu gini Asur.”-Fromthe inscriptions of Tiglath Pileser. Translated verbatim: “He hath subdued theenemies of Assur.” > • 66 -The Ana’kh word Girzutil: Damaged. It could apply to a person or to an> object.

Father. A (A-Miat): Also in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Assyrian. Noun. Water.Originally, it was written phonetically, and was used in a plural form, and theAssyrian word Miat became associated with its original meaning (Water).Quite often, the word “A” refers directly to water.Tiglath Pileser said: “A-na mie inadu”, meaning into waters shall cast.(Sources: Annals of Tiglath Pileser; Nimrud Obelisk, Shalmaneser; Botta’sMonument de Ninive, Paris, 1849; Journal Asiatique, Paris, 1863.)Sennacherib said: “Miat-su nadi kazuti a-na zumme-ya lu asti, meaning of itsflowing nauseous waters for my thirst I drank.” (Source: Koyunjik.)And in the Anunnaki’s Book of Rama-Dosh, Sinhar Marduck said: “An-i miat, rafatbashar-ji,” meaning: from its water, I elevated (Created) Bashar (Man, humanrace).

When Aa is used as Ai, the meaning becomes: Negative; enemy.Nebuchadnezzar said: “Ai isi nakiri”; meaning: “May I not have enemies.”Sardanapalus said: “Kasid ai-but Assur,” meaning: “Capturing the enemies ofAssur.” In the Anunnaki’s literature, women played a major role in the humanaffairs, as well as in the first three Anunnaki’s expeditions to planet Earth.Anunnaki’s women or goddesses were the creators of the human race; they were thefirst geneticists who produced the seven human prototypes, and adjusted theConduit in the brains’ cells of the early humans. Anunnaki’s goddesses wereknown to the early Phoenicians of Arwad as the sun-goddesses, and their secretname was “Ai-Shama.” They had both positive and negative energies, depending onthe intentions of each goddess. The Assyrian concept of the female strength ofthe sun derived from local Phoenician legends, based on oral history and talesknown to the Arwadians, taken from the Anunnaki’s literature. Aa : Noun. . Also in Babylonian .Babylonian great-mother of everything in the universe. She is also the mother ofarts, culture and letters, and goddess of dawn. Aa-bba: Noun. The sea of the Earth.

Aamala: Noun. The Anunnaki’s registry of future events. It is used as a calendarto show important events that will occur on other planets.According Ulema Rajani, time is not linear. And because space bends on itself,therefore, events don’t have a chronology or time-sequences.“Things and events happen on the net of the cosmos. When your mind perceivesthem, they happen before your eyes.But in fact, they have already happened before your have noticed them. Thisapplies to all future and forthcoming events, because also they have occurred onanother cosmos net parallel to the one that have contained separate events.It is a matter of perception, rather than observation or taking notice…” saidUlema Govinda.

However, thefamily is always placed under the direct guidance of a mother. Anunnaki societyis matriarchal.” From the Anunnaki word “Ab”, derived the Arabic word “Ab”, which means father,and the Assyrian word “Ab”, which is an abbreviation of Abu, Abi, Abim, meaningfather.It was mentioned in the ancient Mesopotamian and Assyrian clay tablets; “Abialidi-ka”, meaning: . Of the father begetting thee.When “i” is added to Ab, the meaning becomes: My father. This is quite common inmany Semitic and ancient Middle and Near Eastern languages. For instance, Abibecomes “my father”.In the following Assyrian passages, the word Abi is clearly understood as myfather. “Itti sa abi ipusu” which means: What my father did.“Sa Nabupalhuzur abi banu-a ipusu” means: Which Nabopalasar, my father begettingme, made.

Camel.For years, archeologists and linguists were not sure if Abba “Abbai” reallymeant camel, for they believed that Gamal or Jamal were the Assyrian andAkkadian words for camel, and Abba “Abbai” was the Akkadian word for elephant.With the discovery of the Nimrud Obeslik, linguists were finally able to solvethe puzzle by reading the following passage: “Habbai sa sunai zni-sina…” whichmeans verbatim: “Camels which are their backs.” [Image00007.gif][Image00008.gif] Harbor of Arwad. The Castle of Arwad. [Image00009.gif] Malta today.[Image00010.gif] Ruins of the ancient city of Byblos. T[Image00011.gif] he old city of Sidon.

(Toothers Nibiru).Anunnaki’s books are made from a plasmic material/substance that resemblesaluminum. They have a conic shape, and they rotate on shelves. They are openedor activated either by thought or by pointing at the digital number of eachcone. Abel “Abhal”, “ A-bel-alu” , “Abhel”, “Ablu”, “Habeel”: Name.Also in Babylonian, Assyrian, Sumerian, Arabic, Akkadian and Hebrew.Abel derived from the Anunnaki word “Abhal”, “ A-bel-alu”. It is composed fromthree Ana’kh words:> • 1-A, which means: First; origin; sky.> • 2-Bel, which means: A creator god.> • c-Alu, which means: First created man-form with mental faculties. Abel “Abhal”, “ A-bel-alu” the Anunnaki, became:> • Abhel in Hebrew (In primitive Hebrew: Hebel, Hebhel).> • Habeel in Arabic.> • Ablu in Akkadian and Sumerian. It was first mentioned in the legend of> Tammuz (Ablu Kinu), and meant true son.> • Abel in several western languages. The proto-Jewish Ab means source in Hebrew, and EL means God. The originalHebrew word is Hevel, meaning breath or vapor; it did not contain the words ABor EL.In Ana’kh, we find a similar meaning, for the Anunnaki’s Abel means “original”,and “first prototype”, referring to the first intelligent Man on Earth.A sect of Abelitae , who have lived in North Africa , mentioned Abel as Abil orHaabiil. Epistemologically, Abel derived from the Assyrian Aplu or Ablu . It wasfirst mentioned in the legend of Tammuz (Ablu Kinu), and meant true son. And theAssyrian word Ablu derived from the Anunnaki’s word Abhal.The Assyrian Aplu or Ablu , or Abal means son, similar to the Anunnaki’s wordsIbnu and Ibn, which also means son and/or the first created person. In Hebrew,it became Ben, and in Arabic, Ibn or Bin. Abel-alu: Name. The meaning is not clear. Possibly a human genetic prototype. Itis composed from three words:> • a -A , which means first; origin; sky.> • b -Bel, which means a creator god.> • c -Alu (First created man-form with mental faculties.) Aberu: Noun. Container; tube. Aberu was used by the Anunnaki gods and goddessesin their genetic laboratories to fashion the early forms of human beings. Aberuchimiti: Noun. Laboratories’ tubes used in genetic creation. It is composedof two words:> • a -Aberu, which means container; tube.> • b -Chimiti, which means a laboratory.The word Chimiti appeared in Sumerian epics and texts.See Chimiti. Abeshu. Also in Babylonian, Sumerian, Akkadian and Assyrian. Noun. He was theking of Babylon, and the son of Hammurabi, the legendary king of the firstBabylonian dynasty.Abgal. Noun.a-A man of wisdom.b-A sage in the service of a ruler.Composed of two words:a-Ab or Aba, which mean father,b- Gal, which means a man who has acquired knowledge and wisdom. In otherinstances, Gal could mean an imposing figure, or a man of a grand social status.From Ab, derived Abgal, originally from the Anak’h Ab (leader; father) and Gh’al(From above or from heaven.) Abgal: Noun. Server in a palace, or a temple. Abgaru : Noun.a- Balance,b- Equilibrium.Balance does not mean a physical balance, but a position or a situation whereand when a person maintains a perfect vision, assimilation and understanding ofthe limits, dimensions and length of objects surrounding him/her. In otherwords, it is sensing and remembering the exact position of objects that canexpand within the area where we are standing or walking, even in the dark.Objects are not limited by their physical dimension, and/or the physical placethey occupy. “Almost all objects extend and expand outside what it defines theirmeasurement, shape, and size, because all objects have inertia “Energy” rays orvibes that constantly emanate from them, thus occupying an extra physical place.Not to bump into the vibes area is maintaining balance,” said Ulema W. Li. Ab.har: Anunnaki word for the Akashic Records maintained in the Anunnaki’slibrary, also called the Akashic Library.The Akashic Library is really a very important part of the Anunnaki’s culture.The term Akashic is herewith used because many of us are familiar with what itmeans and represents.The reason it is called the Akashic Library is because it has equipment thatallows the researcher to connect to the Akashic Records; the vast compendium ofknowledge encoded in a non-physical plane of existence, in a substance that iscalled Akasha. In Ana’ kh, it is called Ab.Har, or simply Har.The Akashic Record has been described as a library, a universal computer, themind of God, the universal mind, the collective wisdom, and a dozen othermetaphors, but in the end it is a collection of records of everything that hasever been thought of or experienced, every word, every action. The individualrecords in the global Akashic Records are constantly updated. The Ulema claimthat on Nibiru, each Anunnaki has access to the global Akashic Record throughthe Akashic libraries, which are located in every community.Everywhere, the libraries have the same appearance, and they are built verydifferently from the normally classical architecture of the Anunnaki. Usually,the houses are built of various types of stone, marble, or bricks, but thelibraries are constructed from materials such as glass, fibreglass, or otherplastic-like materials; they give the impression of a modern, industrializededifice. One enters through a huge door that is never closed, day and night. Itopens into a huge hall, seven hundred to one thousand meters in length, by fivehundred meters in width.The hall is empty of any furniture, and is lit by windows that are placed veryhigh, near the ceiling. The windows were designed in such a way that the shaftsof light that enter through them are very sharply delineated and look like solidbeams of light. At night, the same effect is achieved by enormous spot lightsplaced near the windows.The effect is incredibly effective. Extremely large billboards hang on eachwall. On the floor in front of each billboard are hundreds of pads. Whenvisitors enter the library, they approach the billboard, stand each on a pad,and think about their destination within the building.The pad has the capacity to read minds, and as soon as it does so, it begins tomove, and it slides right through the billboard, which is not really solid butis made of a form of energy, carrying the visitor with it. Behind the billboardis the main hall of the Akashic Library, called Mad-Khal.The Anunnaki Akashic Library is not a library in the traditional sense, becauseit contains no physical books on shelves, and not even cones, that are thenormal format for an Anunnaki book. Instead, the visitors find themselves in thepresence of an immense screen, composed of a material not found on Earth. Thescreen is hard to describe; it can be compared to a grid, with a multitude ofmatrices and vortices of data.The screen is contacted through the Conduit which is located in the brain’scells. The screen can read minds, and it knows right away what information thevisitors seek. All what the visitors have to do is stand still in front of thescreen, and the data will be displayed in sequences. Of course, the data is notrepresented by lines, sentences, or paragraphs, but rather by codes. Each codecontains particular information related to an aspect of the subject. Forexample, if you would like to visit Iraq, 2,000 A.D., Iraq 300 B.C., or Iraq2,008 B.C., all you have to do is to focus on these dates, and three codes willappear on the screen waiting for your command to open them up. From this momenton, the Conduit located in your brain and the Screen are communicating in themost direct fashion.The three files (The nearest description of these files would be to call themdigital, for the lack of the proper word) will open up. Each one will containeverything that had happened pertaining to that particular date in Iraq. TheConduit will sort out, classify, and index the particular data for the part ofthe information the visitor is most interested in. Then, the information will bestored automatically in the cells of the visitor’s brain, increasing the size ofthe depot of knowledge in the brain. And because Anunnaki are connected to eachother and to their community via the Conduit, the data recently absorbed is sentto otherAnunnaki to share it, which is extremely beneficial, since if the data receivedfrom the screen is difficult to understand, the Anunnaki community called Jama,or an individual Anunnaki, will send, also automatically, the explanationneeded.This is quite similar to an online technical support on earth, but it is muchmore efficient since it functions brain-to-brain. Each Anunnaki community havethe same kind of center for these mirrors of knowledge which are the Akashicfiles. The complexity of the centers though, is not the same.Some of the Akashic Libraries include more perplexing and complicatedinstruments and tools, which are not readily available to other communities.These tools include the monitor, which is also called mirror or Miraya inAna’kh. Each Miraya is under the direct control of a Sinhar (Anunnaki leader),who serves as custodian and guardian. It is very important to protect theprivacy of every member of the community, because individual Anunnaki couldattempt to tap into the data of the Miraya and have access to the codes of thetelepathic communication of other Anunnaki, thus enabling them to read the mindof all the community members, something that is considered highly unethical andabsolutely must be avoided.The screens, by the way, can expand according to the number of codes that theAnunnaki researcher is using. Seven to ten codes are normal. If more codes thanthat are opened, the screen is fragmented into seven different screens, whichare only visible to an Anunnaki mind. An amazing phenomenon occurs at thismoment; time and space mingle together and become unified into one greatcontinuum.This enables the researcher to grasp all the information in a fraction of asecond. An added convenient aspect of the Akashic files is the ability of theresearcher to access them in the complete privacy of the researcher’s home oroffice, since part the files can be teleported there. But since the privatescreen is not as complicated as the central one in the Central Library, nomultiple screen will open up, only the original one.It is important to understand that the data received is not merely visual. Thereis much more to it than that. By the right side of the screen, there aremetallic compartments as thin as parchment paper, which serve as a cosmic audioantennae, called Min-Zar. These compartments search for, and bring back, anysound that occurred in history, in any era, in any country, and of any magnitudeof importance; this includes voices of all kinds of people, including, saints,preachers, prophets, and wicked ones as well. And this is just a minor part ofit, because it brings additional sounds from other dimensions, and para-galacticcivilizations (Terrestrials and extraterrestrials).According to the Anunnaki, every single sound or voice is never lost in theuniverse. Of course, some sounds do not traverse certain boundaries. For humans,if the sound was produced on earth, such a boundary is the solar system.Each of these antennae-compartments will probe different galaxies and starsystems, listening, recording, retrieving, and playing back sounds, voices, andnoises. “By using one of the codes displayed on the Screen, you can hear thevoice of Jesus, Mohammad, Napoleon, Socrates, Joan of Arc, or any humanity’sgreats’ voices,” said Ulema Penjabi Tien Utan.The voice is never lost, because it is energy and it stays in the perimeter ofits sphere, call it for now, atmosphere, space, etc. The Anunnaki combined assetof the visual and audio systems provided by the Screen, gives anybody theability to learn languages a fforded by the Akashic Library.This applies to any language – past, present or future, and from any part of theuniverse. The researcher can call up a shining globe of light that will swirl onthe screen with enormous speed. As it rotates, the effect blends with an audiotransmission that comes from the metallic compartments. In an instant, anylanguage will sink into the brain’s cells. On the left side of the screen, thereare conic compartments that bring still images of certain important past events.This mini-screen-display informs the researcher that these particular eventscannot be altered. In other words, the Anunnaki cannot go back in the past andchange it.The Anunnaki are forbidden to change or alter the events, or even just parts orsegments of past events represented on the conic compartment, because theseimages represent events created by the Anunnaki themselves. This restrictionworks as a security device, an essential one. For example, a young Anunnakicannot visit planet Earth sixty five thousand years ago, enter the genetic labof the Anunnaki in Sumer or Phoenicia, and change the DNA and the geneticformula originally used by Sinhar Enki, or Sinhar Anu, to create the human race,or the seven prototypes of the human race created by Sinhar Inanna.Sinhar Inanna herself can go back and change it, but not for use on earth as weknow it. She has to transpose it and transport it to another dimension, parallelto the original dimension where the event occurred. This safeguard means thatSinhar Inanna cannot recreate a new race on our earth by sending us, the currentliving humans, sixty five thousand years ago back in time, remoulding us, andthen bringing us back to the twenty first century as new specie, or a new race.This would be unethical. All she could do would be to recreate her ownexperiment in another dimension. For instance, Inanna can go back 2,000 years intime and space, reconstruct the DNA of Jesus Christ and create a new Jesus. Butthe new Jesus will not exist on the map of year 1, or return to Bethlehem to bere-born again. He will be transported as a grown man to another dimension notvery much different from the Palestine Jesus knew.This almost crazy scenario does not contradict today’s quantum physics.Scientifically and theoretically, it is possible.Dr. Steven Hawking, as well asmany of the brightest scientific minds of our time have accepted suchpossibilities.Before the Anunnaki Screen, in the hall of the Akashic Records, more options areavailable for research, and one of them is a sort of browsing. Inside thescreen, there is a slit where the mind of the Anunnaki can enter as a beam. Thiswill open the “Ba’abs”, or Stargates, to other worlds that the researcher is noteven aware of, but appeared randomly as part of the discovery or exploration. Ineach slit there is another Akashic file that belongs to other universes, worlds,dimensions, and civilizations, sometimes more advanced than the Anunnakithemselves, where the researcher can either retrieve important information,and/or witness the creation of the future.It is like going back in the future, because everything present, or occurring inthe future, has already occurred in a distant past and needed time to surfaceand appear before the current living Anunnaki. And there is also the aspect ofsimply having fun, some of it not so ethical.Sometimes an Anunnaki will go back in time, let’s say 400 B.C., choose a famoushistorical figure, and at the same time bring over another important person, onethousand years older, simply to see how they would interact.They can easily deceive these personages, since every Anunnaki is an adept atshape changing.Or they can transpose people, move them in time, and see how they will react tothe new environment. For example, An Anunnaki can bring together John theBaptist, Hannibal, Charles Dickens and Marilyn Monroe and make them talk to eachother. They might not relate to each other, but they will be brought again toone place chosen by the Anunnaki, and a real dialogue will take place. To manyof us, this seems illogical, but to avant-garde astrophysicists, geneticists,and scientists this is a serious possibility. To the Anunnaki, theseextraordinary occurrences are games.These games are strictly forbidden, but some low class Anunnaki andundisciplined children sometime try it as amusement-game. Sometimes theyinterfere with our daily affairs, and cause us temporary loss of memory as aresult of that. Anunnaki children, though usually extremely well-behaved, mayalso play silly games, such as deliberately misplacing our objects, our carkeys, our cellular phone, pens, hats, and then returning them, to the amazementof the humans. These tricks, while they can be quite annoying, never harm anyone seriously.One unpleasant result may surface in therapy. A psychiatrist might tell theperson complaining of such an event that his or her mind is playing tricks.Well, it is indeed a trick, but not from the mind. It is performed by theAnunnaki people. Abi: Also in Sumerian and Assyrian. Noun. Father. Also written as Abu. Derivedfrom the Ana’kh Ab. See also, Abu, Ab, Abba. Hammurabi said: “Abim pi alidi-ya”,which means: Of my father who begat me.

Abikti: Also in Assyrian and Akkadian. Noun. Defeat. Abi-Milki “ Abimilcah” : Also in Phoenician. Noun. Abi-Milk is derived from hisoriginal Phoenician name Abimelech, itself derived from the Ana’kh wordAbimilcah . He ruled the Phoenician city of Tyre (Sour, today) during the reignof Pharaoh Akhenaten. Abimelech was an Anunnaki’s offspring. Abi-Milki“Abimelech” was also one of the authors of the Amarna letters that mentionedmany of the kings and rulers of the era, such as Etakkama of Kadesh Zimridi ofSidon (Saida, today), and Aziru of Amurru. He corresponded regularly withAkhenaten, and in his letters, he reported on political situations inneighboring cities in Phoenicia, Palestine and Syria. Excerpt from his second letter to the pharaoh:“… I have said to the sun-god ( Akhenaten)My lord, when shall I see the face of the King?I am guarding Tyre (In Phoenicia)…” According to Ulema Mordachai ben Zvi, Abi-Milki ,“Abimelech”, “Abimilcah ”, andPharaoh Akhenaten, belonged to a secret Anunnaki’s offspring brotherhood inKarnak and Luxor, in ancient Egypt. Akhenaten who reigned about 3,500 years ago(The eighteenth dynasty) was the mentor of Moses, and other visionaries of theera. Akhenaten abolished Egyptian polytheism, and established the worship ofAten, a single god, who was one of the most powerful Anunnaki’s Sinhars, andrepresented Aten with the symbol of the Sun. Aten was introduced to Akhenaten byAbimilcah. Akhenaten told the newly appointed priests of his temples, that hewas a descendant of an extraterrestrial divine race, and Aten was the only andthe true god of the universe.The worship of the new god Aten was influenced by the secret Anunnaki’soffspring brotherhood in Egypt and Phoenicia. Those who believed Akhenaten,called him the Sun-God. In Phoenicia, the Tyrians called him ElShem. El meanslord or god, and shem means the sun. Abinadab: Also in Hebrew. Noun.There are several Biblical personages named Abinadab, but the one relating tothe Anunnaki was a villager of Kiriath-jearim, and a member of the tribe ofJudah. When the Philistines captured the Ark, it brought chaos everywhere theyplaced it.The statue of their god Dagon was broken, people suddenly died, and altogetherthe Philistines realized that the Ark wished to be returned to the Israelites.They took it to Abinadab, who was willing to accept it, knowing it for what itwas, an Anunnaki artifact that had to be carefully monitored and could bedangerous. No one was hurt in his house, and eventually he and his sons safelyreturned the Ark to Jerusalem, where David built a special warehouse for it. Abiroon: Noun.The name given by the Anunnaki to the Atlanteans. It means “The people whocrossed the lands or traversed sea and waters.” Similar to “Habiru”, the namegiven to the Hebrews.

In other words, the Anunnaki map to the otherworld, the afterlife!! *** *** *** The goddess-angel Lama in a ritual gesture. [Image00018.gif]Photo: The goddess-angel Lama in a ritual gesture, circa 2330-2150 B.C. Akkadperiod. Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Babylonian-Mesopotamian prayers had to be chanted or recited out loud and alwaysaccompanied by very specific ritual gestures, such as the “Su-ila”, meaning, the“Uplifted hands.”These prayers were to be addressed to the Abkallu, who in return will elevatethem to the gods. This seal (left) depicts Lama, the angel-goddess praying in a ritual manner withuplifted hands.This was the tradition observed during the Neo-Sumerian and Old Babylonianperiod, circa 2100-1600, B.C.Several Babylonian deities were depicted as angels with or without wings.They acted as guardians (Abkalu), and protectors of worshipers, and in someinstances, they offered their prayers to higher deities, on behalf of humanbeings. Abkiz: Noun. A trench. Ablal: Noun.a- A shelter,b- A bird-nest. Ablu. Also in Assyrian and Sumerian. Noun. Son.Ablu kinu means eldest son. Ablu-ara: Noun. First-born child. Ablumari: Noun.

The Ab-n’gal had a small colony of extraterrestrials on theIsland of Arwad. Abnu: Also in Sumerian and Assyrian . Noun. Rock. Abnuri: Noun.a- A Hill,b- A small mountain. Ab-ram “Abraam”. Noun. Adjective.Title of leadership given to the Biblical patriarch Abraham by the Anunnakigod/king Ea or Enki.Historically, and as an Akkadian/Babylonian/Semite noun, it was used as acollective name for Aramean tribes; the Habiru (Ancient Hebrews), and theIshmaelites. Abra-ah: Noun. Name of the Fiffth Element in the Anunnaki’s matrix. It meanstranscending time and space. The Ulema coined it “Niktat Alkhou-Lood”, and itmeans verbatim: The point of the beginning of immortality. Abraah, Sinhar “Abraach”: Noun. Name of the Anunnaki scientist who is in chargeof recording and updating the “Abra-ah”, which is the fifth element in theAnunnaki’s matrix, and means transcending time and space.The Ulema coined the Anunnaki’s Matrix “Niktat Alkhou-Lood”, meaning the pointof the beginning of immortality. Abradu: Noun. The custodian of the conic books of an Anunnaki library, andparticularly the calendars of future events. Usually depicted as a deity in theform of an eagle, or a man with the face of an eagle with large wings. Thisdepiction was very common in several manuscripts and calendars of the ancientworld; Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Phoenicia, Turkey, Persia, and including theMayas, Incas and Aztecs. It is the belief of Ulema Mordachai ben Zvi, that thereis a direct link between the remnants of the Anunnaki in Sumer and Phoenicia andthe Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations. The study of the Mayan calendarand other pertinent inscriptions revealed Mayan deities resembling the Abradus,and depicted as a man-eagle with huge wings. The Anunnaki calendar does notinterpret time as a fixed period or periods or events, but rather a continuum ofpast-present-future. It is not linear but perpetual and shapeless. Strikingly,the Mayan Trecenas share similar principle(s) and represent spiritual andnon-linear concepts of time. In “Ilmu Donia” manuscripts, almost all the Abradusare depicted as a winged sage and/or an eagle with multiple wings, similar tothe Mayan “Calendar Eagle”, sometimes referred to as a dragon, or a celestialbird.

Adala: Anunnaki’s term for karma.Although the Anunnaki do not believe in religions as we do on earth, their senseand understanding of ethics, justice, good and evil deeds, and merits are welldeveloped. The Anunnaki have families, parents, children, social ethics and law.They see the universe, the development of mind and character’s evolvement quitedifferently from the way we do.They take into a great consideration the consequences of an act, even a thought.The Anunnaki do not have courts of law, trials, tribunals, prosecutors, judges,lawyers and corporal punishment, but they have established rules that governbehavior, merits, deeds, and social justice. However, karma is not a reward fordeeds after death. Because the Anunnaki do not believe in reincarnation, aspiritual life after death, the return of one’s body, character and soul toNibiru after death. It is difficult to explain the Anunnaki’s karma interrestrial terms. But, basically, Anunnaki’s karma is the place and function adeceased Anunnaki occupies and plays in a sphere existing beyond the one he/sheleft. In contrast with karma on earth, all Anunnaki have the ability to changetheir karma and their next destination before they die.Even though, death does not exist in the Anunnaki’s world, as we understanddeath on earth, all Anunnaki reach a point when and where the last cell ofenergy in their bodies ceases to function, thus resulting in the deteriorationof their bodies.After that, the Anunnaki body fades away, and the mind of the new Anunnakioccupies one of the doubles or copies of their minds and bodies.

Their intentionswere to create a race that could carry heavy physical load and do intensephysical labor. This was the initial and prime objective. Thus, the “Naphsiya”(DNA) they put in us had limited lifespan, and mental faculties.Later on, they discovered that they had to prolong the human lifespan and addmore developed mental faculties, so they added the Hara-Kiya (Internal energy orphysical strength).Few generations later, the early human beings stock evolves considerably,because the Anunnaki added fully operational Mind in the human body. To do so,they installed a Conduit with limited capabilities. In the same time, thisConduit was also installed into the prototype of the human body. Thus, throughthe Mind, the physical body of the humans got linked to the Double.. This non-physical link created a Fourth dimension for all of us. In fact, it didnot create a Fourth dimension per se, rather it activated it.So now, at that stage, humans had a physical dimension (Life on earth), andnot-a-totally separated non-physical dimension called Nafis-Ra.Bashar (Humans) became destined to acquire two dimensions, as exactly theAnunnaki decided. Later on, centuries upon centuries, the human mind began toevolve, because the other Mind, call it now the Double or prototype began toevolve simultaneously and in sync.The more the prototype is advanced the more the “Physical Mind” becomes alert,creative and multidimensional. But we are not trapped, and our mind is no longerconditioned by the Anunnaki. The Anunnaki gave us all the choices,opportunities, freewill and freedom to learn on our own and progress. This iswhy we are accountable and responsible for everything we do and think about.Because of the evolution of our mind, and realization of an inner knowledge ofour surroundings, and understanding what is right and what is wrong, a majormental faculty emerged in all of us: Conscience.

A child. Ameshada : Noun. Adjective. A great warrior. Amioun: Phoenician. Noun. Name of an old town in Lebanon.Amioun’s history goes back to the time of the Phoenicians. Amioun was mentionedas Amia in the 14 th century B.C. Letters of Tel Al Amarna, written byPhoenician kings who were subjects of the pharaoh. Epistemologically, the wordAmioun derived from the Aramaic word Emun, which means fortress.In 1946, in the vicinity of the tower of St. Phocas in Amioun, engineers membersof the French military topography team discovered unidentified ancientparchments, figurines, Assyrian coins, tablets, slabs, and Phoenicianterracotta-clay fragments containing passages from the Phoenician story of theCreation, and a substantial deposit of minted gold. Ammizadugga: Also in Babylonian and Akkadian. Noun.An Anunnaki’s offspring and a king of Babylon (2202-2182 B.C.) He was mentionedin the Flood story in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Amnanu: Also in Akkadian and Babylonian. Noun.The name of the ancient kingdom of Erech. Ammr-il: Noun. Strength of the god or king. Composed of two words:> • a -Ammr, which means life; good health; longevity;> • b -Il, wich means od; ruler, synonym: El.)From Ammr-il, derived the Phoenician word Amrit, which became the name of afamous Phoenician city, and the Arabic word Amr, which means age, lifespan. Amon: Hebrew. Noun.Various individuals exist in the Bible with that name, but the most importantone is an Anunnaki who was engaged in scientific activities near the city ofThebes. [Image00036.gif] Amioun, Lebanon. Centuries after his departure from Earth, his name was remembered, and as oftenhappened, he became the local god of the city. In 1700 B.C.E., Thebes conqueredthe city states of Lower Egypt, and Amon join the Egyptian pantheon, laterbecoming the sun god of the Egyptians. Amram: Noun. Good subjects of the Anunnaki’s leaders; good union; highlydeveloped communities.Composed of two words :> • a -Am (Good; kind).> • b -Ram (People; community; population; tribe.)In Biblical studies, Amram meant high people; kindred of the High; friend ofJehovah.In primitive Arabic, Ram meant: People; group. Henceforth, the name of thePalestinian city Ramallah could be interpreted as the people of God, since Allahmeans to the Arabs and Muslims, what exactly the word Jehovah means to the Jews:God.When Enki or Ea called upon Avraham, he told him: I am your god, and I am nowchanging your name from Av-raham to Ab-Raham, because you are going to lead mypeople as the father of my people on earth. Av became Ab. And Ab in all the 14different ancient languages of the Near East and the Middle East means father.From the Ana’kh Ab, derived the words: Ab, Abu, Abi, Aba, Abba, Abuya, Abouna;all meaning the very same thing: Father. And from the Ana’kh word ram, derivedthe ancient Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic word Ram: People. Centuries later, Ramacquired a multitude of meanings.For instance:> • a -In ancient Hebrew, Ram is pleasing.> • b -In Sanskrit mythology, Ram means supreme.> • c -In the pre-Islamic Arabic era, called Al-Gahiliya “Jahiliya” (Years of> darkness), Ram meant a group of people. Synonym: Ra’bh.From the Ana’kh Ram, we have today, the Arabic Ramy and the Spanish Ramos. Inancient times the early Armenians called themselves the people of Ram. Amraphel: Also in Sumerian and Akkadian. Noun. Name of an Anunnaki “FallenAngel” offspring, and king of Sennaar (Shinar), or Babylonia[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02179b.htm] ; one of the four Mesopotamiankings—the other three being:> • 1-Arioch, King of Pontus [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12234c.htm]> (Ellasar);> • 2-Chodorlahomor, King of Elam;> • 3-Thadal King of Nations ( Goyim> [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06422a.htm] ) Amrit: Phoenician/Ugaritic. Noun.Name of an ancient Phoenician city located in Syria, co-built by the remnants ofthe Anunnaki and early Phoenicians from Tyre and Sidon.Amrit derived from the Ana’kh Ammr-il. Amrit is one of the most puzzling,mysterious and enigmatic cities in recorded history.It was the stage for a cosmic war between many ancient nations; the birth of theoriginal Olympiads; the world’s first Anunnaki-Phoenician medical center; thecity that produced Mah-Rit, the early form/formula of what we call todaysteroids, an early genetic product created by the Anunnaki. Amrit was the city that created what we call today the Olympic Games. Contraryto all beliefs, the Olympic Games did not start in Greece, but in Amrit.The opening ceremony included 5 teams of athletes from the Island of Arwad, andthe cities of Tyre, Sidon, Tartous and Byblos. A stadium is still visible inAmrit.The first Olympic (so to speak) athletic event occurred in Amrit around 1,400B.C. Today, tourists visiting Amrit are fascinated by an elaborate altar builtby the Phoenicians to honor their god Melkart (A god created for the Phoeniciansby the Anunnaki.) This is the apparent historical version.But, in fact, the altar was erected by the remnants of the Anunnaki who had aninfluential center in the Island of Arwad, not very far from Amrit. The altarserved as a healing center using Anunnaki medicine and Phoenicians’ oracles.Amrit was a scientific center for the remnants of the Anunnaki and earlyPhoenicians who practiced a very advanced medicine mixed with oracles andpara-psychological powers.The Crusaders, and particularly the Knights Templar order organized secretmeetings on the plateau of the temple and read excerpts from the Rama-Dosh Book,especially the passages related to metal transmutation that allowed them tochange iron and copper into gold.[Image00037.gif] The Phoenician Temple of Melkart at Amrit.____________ The Melkart’s Shrines at Carthage (Modern Tunis) and Amrit were decorated withAnunnaki’s motifs and symbols, such as the Arwad’s Serpent representing wisdom,knowledge and science, and the Tyrian moon crescent representing a new birth,and the Anunnaki Delta-Tyrian Triangle, representing the equilibrium of natureand man. [Image00038.gif] Melkart of Carthage. [Image00039.gif] Around this ancient Phoenician monument, the ritual ceremony of Mahrit tookplace.

Name of humans who walked on three legs, supposedlycreated by non-terrestrial geneticists who have visited earth some 450,000 yearsago.Some ufologists suggest that they were genetically created by the Igigi. Someauthors have claimed that the Igigi have created a very primitive form of humanbeings, lacking intelligence and mobility. The Igigi considered the earlyquasi-humans to be not much more than machines with limited mental faculties,and those early forms of humans looked like apes. The Igigi actuallyexperimented a bit with the early human-forms:The Earth was extremely cold at that time, and the Igigi had to cover the humanbodies with lots of hair to protect them from the elements. It took thequasi-human race thousands of years to evolve into an early human form, and eventhen not totally human, still looking like apes. Some of them had bizarre skullsand facial bones.First, they created the “Nafar Jinmarkah” meaning ‘individual on three legs.’They consisted of a very strong physical body but lacked agility. Those bodieswere created to carry heavy weight. The three legs’ purpose was to support heavyloads they could lift and carry. Later on, the Igigi worked on a new human formthat consisted of a body with two legs, in order to bring speed and betteragility. Yet, early humans remained terrifying, nothing like the Biblicaldescriptions. The Igigi tried several times. And each time, they faced a problemin designing the human skull.Early Igigi creators did not want to put brains in the skull sohuman-forms-bodies would not think. These early human-forms were the world’sfirst robots. Anagim: Also in Sumerian, Chaldean and Akkadian.Conjunction.How? Anagim: Also in Sumerian, Chaldean and Akkadian.Conjunction. What? Anakim: Also in Sumerian, Akkadian and Hebrew. Noun.The descendants of Anak, or Enoch, Cain’s son. Although it was claimed byBiblical scholars, and particularly Hebrew scribes that a flood had been sent todestroy them, there were still entire cities and settlements of Anakim in thelands of Canaan as late as the time of Moses. Jewish chronicler Josephus statesthat even in his own day it was not uncommon for people to dig up giganticskeletal remains, referring to the giant Anakim.Spies sent by Moses to report on the Anakim strongholds reported back that theAnakim were so large that the Hebrews seemed “like grasshoppers” in comparison. Anaku: Also in Assyrian and Sumerian. Pronoun. I. A-ñálá: Also in Sumerian , Chaldean and Akkadian. Noun.Bag made from leather used to contain, carry, or store goods, cereals, or water.Composed of two words:a- A , which means water.b- Nala, which means to contain; to transport; to carry. A-nameshda-dosh: A title, also an attribute.A supreme leader; a commander; a ruler.Composed from three words:> • a -An, which means heavenly; god; the one.> • b -Ameshada, which means a great warrior.> • c -Dosh, which means holy; sacred; divine.From A-nameshda-dosh, derived the Sumerian and Babylonian Namesda (Warrior;ruler.)A-namidra: Noun.Name of the Anunnaki scientist who monitors the Earth Matrix, calledAnamid-Raya, also Anid Ariya.This Matrix is extremely complicated, because it is written in codes, symbols,geometrical forms, chemical formulas, theorems, “and in all the languages thathave existed, still exist, and will be invented in the future after 2022,” saidthe Ulema. In other words, it is a cosmic library, archives, and depository ofall the knowledge and events of 5 billions years, the estimated date of thebeginning of Earth. A-namidra and Earth Matrix:A-namidra provided fascinating and mind-bending information in this matrix thathave captivated academicians and leading scientists in the Eastern and Westernhemispheres. Included in his data are detailed descriptions and explanations of:> • 1 -Primordial bio-engineering of terrestrial life - forms (Elements, nature,> animals, and humans);> • 2 -Building blocks of life, and how they acted like cells to produce life on> earth;> • 3 -DNA’s fifth unknown element;> • 4 -RNA (Humans and non-humans) and life evolution;> • 5 -The origin and the genetic creation of the human races by the Anunnaki;> • 6 -The Earth-made human creatures;> • 7 -The Space-made human creatures;> • 8 -Metabolism and the oceans-made human creatures;> • 9 -Man-made humans and reverse engineering of the human brain;> • 10 -The Anunnaki’s “Conduit”. A-namidra explains what kind of clay, the Anunnaki used to create Man:One of the most striking revelations of Sinhar A-namidra is his explanation ofthe “Clay” used by the Anunnaki to genetically create the first human species.The Anunnaki’s matrix mentioned clay as one of the primordial ingredients orelements they have used to create the human race. It is extremely important tounderstand the real meaning of the word clay. A-namidra explained to the Ulema,that “Clay” is not what everybody understood or thought to be, from reading thetranslations of the Sumerian texts. It is not the earthly clay found in ancientSumer near the Tigris and Euphrates banks.The Anunnaki’s matrix explained and defined it very differently.Judaism, Christianity and Islam got hooked on clay. Scholars who have translatedthe Sumerian texts and/or interpreted them made a huge mistake when theyreferred to clay as the mud or dirt substance the Anunnaki found in ancientIraq, and mixed it with their DNA to create mankind…” said Ulema Govinda. TheAnunnaki used a plasmic liquid that coagulated very rapidly, and short after,the coagulation took the apparent physical properties of the clay.But the substance was not dirt, rather plasmo-organic.A-namidra explains the creation of Man from cosmic clay:A-namidra told the Ulema, that some of the very early human races were notcreated by the Anunnaki. The earliest human-animal species were originallycreated in space, and this included many animals and various plants. The life ofthe earliest human-animal species started within the clay found inside comets. A-namidra spoke about the early human species who lived underwater:A-namidra spoke to the Anunnaki-Ulema about the existence and origin of earlyhuman-like creatures who lived at the bottom of the oceans. He explained that“one of the earliest life-forms on planet Earth began at the very bottom of theoceans, where metabolism originated through “Mai-ai” (Water)Metabolism created an early human-like form. Those creatures had a human skull,two eyes without retina, two legs and four long arms, but no nose, no ears, andno hair on their bodies.” They were called the Basharma’h. (Bashar means humanrace, and Ma’h means water.) A-natabaru “Anda-Barikha”: Noun. Name of the Anunnaki Sinhar who taught theAnunnaki-Ulema about the mind’s projection ( reenactment) of all the events andacts (Bad and good) of one’s life.This process is called “Judgment by the Brain”. In accordance with the SinharAnathabaru’s teachings, Ulema Saddik Ghandar Ranpour said: “Seconds before youleave earth, your mind will project the reenactment of all the events and acts(Bad and good) in your life, past, present and future, and “zoom” you righttoward your next nonphysical destination, where and when you judge yourself,your deeds, your existence and decide whether you wish to elevate yourself to ahigher dimension, or stay in the state of nothingness and loneliness.You will not return to earth, nor your soul wiould migrate to another soul oranother body, because the Anunnaki do not believe in reincarnation or in aphysical return to earth. Earth is the lowest sphere of existence for humans.Thus, you are always connected to the Anunnaki in this life and the next one.The Anunnaki were the ones who created the brain for the humans. These earlybrains contained two million cells. But the Anunnaki worked years on theprototypes of humans. In their final genetic experiments, the Anunnakiprogrammed humans with the thirteen original faculties, implanted in the brain’scells.” A-ñi: Also in Sumerian, Akkadian and Phoenician. Noun.a- A large quantity of water.b- A small flood.Composed of two words:a- A, which means water.b- Ni, which means an overflow. Añar: Also in Sumerian. Noun.Torrent; heavy rain. Composed of two words:a- A , which means water,b- Ñar , which means to precipitate; to gather; to add. Añárin : Noun. A flat field. An-ba: Verb. To refuse.Anbar : Noun. Celestial metal.An-bar: Noun. Noon. Anda-anparu: An expression meaning verbatim: Judgment by the brain. In hisKira’at, Ulema Saddik Ghandar Ranpour said: “Seconds before you leave earth,your mind will project the reenactment of all the events and acts (Bad and good)in your life, past, present and future. And it will “zoom” you right toward yournext nonphysical destination, where and when you judge yourself, your deeds,your existence and decide whether you wish to elevate yourself to a higherdimension, or stay in the state of nothingness and loneliness. You will notreturn to Earth, and your soul will not migrate to another soul or another body,because the Anunnaki do not believe in reincarnation or in a physical return toearth. Earth is the lowest sphere of existence for humans. Thus, you are alwaysconnected to the Anunnaki in this life and the next one. The Anunnaki were theones who created the brain for the humans. These early brains contained twomillion cells.But the Anunnaki worked years on the prototypes of humans. In their finalgenetic experiments, the Anunnaki programmed humans with the thirteen originalfaculties, implanted in the brain’s cells.” Later, on, the Anunnaki haveimproved on their initial prototypes, and included additional mental faculties. Andùl : Noun. Shade.Ane : Pronoun. He; she. Áñeba : Adverb. At night. An-edin: Noun.a- High ground,b- Eelevated field.Composed of two words:a- An, which means high,b- Edin (Garden; field.)From edin, derived the word Eden. Anene: Pronoun.a- They,b- Them. A-ñi: Also in Sumerian, Akkadian and Phoenician. Noun.A large quantity of water; a small flood. Composed of two words: a- A, whichmeans water,b- Ni, which means an overflow. AnHaf-nah: Also in Phoenician and Arabic.The secret esoteric name and symbol of a type of mushroom used in a magicaldiet. The mushroom was a very important symbol in the early Ana’kh manuscriptsgiven to the Phoenicians and later on to King Solomon.Mushroom in Ana’kh is Haf-nah, and it represents many things such as:> • 1 -Fecundity;> • 2 -Occult power;> • 3 -Heredity;> • 4 -Life;> • 5 -Genetical reproduction;> • 6 -A sexual symbol referring to a woman. Ancient Sumerian, Persians and Phoenicians myths tell us how patriarchs used anextraction from mushroom and mixed it with an Anunnaki female DNA to create asecret race of creatures capable of building huge edifices and temples.Legend has it that the Templar knights learned this secret while digging in thebasements and underground tunnels of the temple of King Solomon. The Book ofRama-Dosh elaborated on this mixture and described how Haf-nah was used tocreate an extraordinary human race capable of performing miracles andteleporting stones of an immense dimension.In the early Phoenician language, Haf-na meant:> • a -Hand;> • b -Grabbing;> • c -Instrument. Ironically and interestingly enough, if you read the Christian Arabictranslation of the Bible you will find this phrase: “Haf-nat Tourab”.And this is mind-boggling, because it refers to the creation of Adam, in otherwords the creation of the human race. In Arabic, Haf-na means:> • a -What a hand can grab;> • b -A small quantity. The contemporary meaning of the word Tourab in Arabic is:> • a -Sand.> • b -Dirt. Now, if you add Haf-na+Tourab, you get this: The hand grabs dirt. And this ishow the Christian Arabic Bible interprets the creation of Adam; God grabbed withhis hand dirt from the ground. So, the mushroom, hand, and dirt areenigmatically connected in the creation’s script of the ancients. The meaning ofthe name of the great Perseus, founder of the Perseid Dynasty , and builder ofthe citadel of Mycenae is: “The Place of the Mushroom”, and variousillustrations of the mushroom appear abundantly on churches’ columns. Anotherstriking example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedek that appeared on afaçade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding a chalice in the shape ofa mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the Holy Grail, as interpreted in theliterature of Cathars, Templar Knights, and many enlightened eastern secretsocieties.It was also interpreted as the “Divine-Human Vessel”, meaning the womb of VirginMary; the very womb that gave birth to Jesus.In ancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to the Anunnaki,the mushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of the female. Moreprecisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of life and allliving creatures.This fecundity source came in the form of a mitochondrial DNA. Also, the secretextracted liquid of the mushroom represented the “Light Liquid” known also asElixir of Life. (Book of Rama-dosh). On many Templars’ pillars and Bourj (Upperpart of a medieval fortress or a castle) in Syria, Malta and Lebanon, themushroom is carefully illustrated as a “Flower of Life” known to thePhoenicians, Habiru (Hebrew), early Arabs, Sumerians and Anunnaki as:> • a- Wardah;> • b -Ward;> • c -Vardeh.These three words (Meaning a rose, or a flower) in ancient linguistic context,symbolized the blooming of life. At one point in history, the mushroom’s figurewas used by the Templar Order of St. John of Malta as the symbol of the HolyGrail. And in other passages, the mushroom represented a head; the head of aleader. Some historians thought that the leader was Baphomet, while othersbelieved is was Noah, and another group believed it was the Prophet Mohammed,and finally, there is a group of learned masters who claimed that is was theKhalek of Markabah. Khalek is one of the seventy two names/attributes of God inArabic, and Markabah or Merkabah means a spaceship in Sumerian and Akkadian. TheAnunnaki’s mushroom symbol gave birth to the “Cult of Head”. Anne Ross in herbook “ Pagan Celtic Britain”, wrote: “The Cult of the Human Head constitutes apersistent theme throughout all aspects of Celtic life spiritual and temporaland the symbol of the severed head may be regarded as the most typical anduniversal of their religious attitudes.”King Solomon, King Hiram, and King Perseus learned the secret of “Anhafnah”,from Anananda. Ulema have states according to the Kira’at of Anananda, that atone time in history, “Anhafnah”, was the early form of “Sacred Geometry”, usedby the Hyskos, the Armenians, the Persians, and the Templars, to build theircastles and cathedrals. And “Anhafnah”, was represented as a labyrinth on thefloor of many cathedrals.The Knight Templars who have studied the Anunnaki’s Book of Ramadosh, followed asecret ritual path of “Anhafnah”, to accomplish extraordinary deeds, and amass alegendary fortune.The meaning of the name of the great Perseus, founder of the Perseid Dynasty ,and builder of the Citadel of Mycenae is: “The Place of the Mushroom”, andvarious illustrations of the mushroom appear abundantly on churches’ columns.Another striking and unique example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedekthat appeared on a façade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding achalice in the shape of a mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the HolyGrail, as interpreted in the literature of Cathars, Templars, and manyenlightened eastern secret societies. It was also interpreted as the“Divine-Human Vessel”, meaning the womb of Virgin Mary; the very womb that gavebirth to Jesus.In ancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to the Anunnaki,the mushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of the female. Moreprecisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of life and allliving creatures._______________________ Photo below: Labyrinth at Grace Cathedral, San Francisco .L[Image00042.jpg] abyrinth Walks - The Twisty Path to Clarity : There are anumber of practices referred to as “walking meditation,” some of which involvespecial postures, steps, or mental exercises. One very interesting form ofwalking meditation, which is often practiced in Christian mystical traditions,uses the pattern of a labyrinth as its focal point. AnHayya’h, “A-haYA”, “Aelef-hayat”: An-Hayya’h could be the most important wordin the whole literature of the Anunnaki and Ana’kh, because it deals with:1 -The origin of man on earth;2 -How humans are connected to the Anunnaki;3 -Importance of water vis-à-vis humans and Anunnaki;4 -The life of humans;5 -Proof that it was a non-terrestrial woman who created man, Adam and the humanrace via her Anunnaki identity;6 -The return of the Anunnaki to earth;7 -Humanity salvation, hopes, and a better future for all of us; “a gift fromour ancestors and creators, the Anunnaki,” said the Ulema.It is extremely difficult to find the proper and accurate word or words in ourterrestrial languages and vocabularies.The word “ An-Hayya’h” is composed of:1 -An or A (Pronounced Aa), or Aelef (Pronounced a’leff).It is the same letter in Ana’kh , Akkadian, Canaanite, Babylonian, Assyrian,Ugaritic, Phoenician, Moabite, Siloam, Samaritan, Lachish, Hebrew, Aramaic,Nabataean-Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic. All these languages are derived from theAna’kh.(Note: The early Greeks adopted the Phoenician Alphabet, and the Latin andCyrillic came from the Greek.The Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek scripts all came from the Phoenician. Arabic andmost of Indian scriptures came from the Aramaic. The entire Western worldreceived its languages from the Phoenicians, the descendants of the Anunnaki.)An means one or all of the following:> • 1 -Beginning;> • 2 -The very first;> • 3 -The ultimate;> • 4 -The origin;> • 5 -Water. On earth, this word became Alef in Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac andArabic. Alef is the beginning of the alphabet in these languages. In Latin, it’sA, and in Greek is Alpha. In Hebrew, the Aleph consists of two yuds (PronouncedYood) ; one Yud is situated to the upper right and the other yud to the lowerleft.Both Yuds are joined by a diagonal vav . They represent the higher water and thelower water, and between them the heaven. This mystic-kabalistic interpretationwas given to us by Rabbi Isaac Luria.Water is extremely important in all the sacred scriptures, as well as in thevast literature and scripts of extraterrestrials and Anunnaki.Water links humans to the Anunnaki. In the Babylonian account of the Creation ,Tablet 1 i llustrates Apsu ( Male ), representing the primeval fresh water, andTiamat ( Female ), the primeval salt water.These were the parents of the gods. Apsu and Tiamat begat Lahmu ( Lakh mu ) andLahamu ( Lakh amu ) deities.In the Torah, the word water was mentioned in the first day of the creation ofthe world : “And the spirit of God hovered over the surface of the water.” Inthe Chassidut, the higher water is “wet” and “warm”, and represents thecloseness to Yahweh (God), and it brings happiness to man.The lower water is “cold”, and brings unhappiness because it separates us fromYahweh (God), and man feels lonely and abandoned. The Ten Commandments commenceswith the letterAlef : “ Anochi (I) am God your God who has taken you out of the land of Egypt,out of the house of bondage.”The letter Alef holds the secret of man, his creation and the whole universe(Midrash). In Hebrew, the numeric value of Aleph is 1. And the meaning is:> • 1 -First;> • 2 -Adonai;> • 3 -Leader;> • 4 -Strength;> • 5 -Ox;> • 6 -Bull;> • 7 -Thousand;> • 8 -To teach. According to Jewish teaching, each Hebrew letter is a spiritual force and powerby itself, and comes directly from Yahweh (God). This force contains the rawmaterial for the creation of the world and man. The Word of God ranges from theAleph (The very first letter) to the Tav (The last letter) in Hebrew.In Revelation 1:8, Jesus said: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and theending.” In John 1:1-3, as the Word becomes Jesus, the Lord Jesus is also theAleph and the Tav, as well as the Alpha and the Omega. In Him exists all theforces, and spiritual powers of the creation. Jesus is also connected to water,an essential substance for the purification of the body and the soul, this iswhy Christians got to be baptized in water.In Islam, water is primordial and considered as the major force of the creationof the universe.The Prophet Mohammad said (From the Quran):“Wa Khalaknah Lakoum min al Ma’i, koula chay en hay”, meaning: And WE (Allah)have created for you from water everything alive.”The Islamic numeric/spiritual value of Aleph and God is 1.To the Anunnaki and many extraterrestrial civilizations, the An or Alefrepresents number 1, as well as planet Nibiru, the constellation Orion, the starAldebaran, and above all the female aspect of the creation symbolized in theAnunnaki’s female “Gb’r” (Angel Gabriel to us.)Hayya’h also means:> • a -Life;> • b -Creation;> • c -Humans;> • d -Earth. In Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Turkish, Syriac, and so many Eastern languages, theAnunnaki words “Hayya’h” and “Hayat” mean the same thing: Life.But the most striking part of our story is that the original name of Eve is notEve, but “Hawwa” derived directly from Hayya. How do we know this? Very simple:Eve’s name in the Bible is “Hawwa”, also “Chevvah”.In the Quran is also “Hawwa”, and in all the Semitic and Akkadian texts, Eve iscalled Hawwa or Hayat, meaning the giver of life; the source of the creation.Now, if we combine the 2 words: An +Hayya’h or Hayat, we get this: Beginning;The very first; The ultimate; The origin; Water + Life; Creation; Humans; Earth,where the first was created; Woman.And the whole meaning becomes: The origin of the creation and first thing orperson who created the life of humans was a woman (Eve; Hawwa) or water.Amazingly enough, in Ana’kh, woman and water mean the same thing, because womanas a creative female energy represents water according to the Babylonian,Sumerians and Anunnaki tablets, as clearly written in the Babylonian-Sumerianaccount of the Creation , Tablet 1.The Anunnaki who created us genetically some 65,000 B.C. lived on earth with us,in Iraq (Sumer, Mesopotamia, Babylon) and Lebanon (Loubnan, Phoenicia,Phinikia).They taught our ancestors how to write, how to speak, how to play music, how tobuild temples, how to navigate, as well as geometry, algebra, metallurgy,irrigation, astronomy, you name it. But the human races disappointed them, forthe early human beings were cruel, violent, greedy and ungrateful.So, the Anunnaki gave up on us and left earth.The few remaining Anunnaki living in Iraq and Lebanon were killed by savagemilitary legions from Greece, Turkey and other nations of the region. TheAnunnaki left earth for good.Other extraterrestrial races came to earth, but these celestial visitors werenot friendly and considerate like our ancestors the Anunnaki.The new extraterrestrials had a different plan for humanity, and their agendaincluded abduction of women and children, animal mutilation, genetic experimentson human beings, creating a new hybrid race, etc…The Anunnaki did not totally forget us. After all, many of their women weremarried to humans, and many of our women were married to Anunnaki.Ancient history, the Bible, Sumerian tablets, Akkadian cylinders, Babylonianscriptures, Phoenician inscriptions, and historical accounts from around theglobe recorded these events.You can find them, almost intact, in archeological sites in Iraq and Lebanon, aswell as in museums, particularly the British Museum, the Iraqi Museum and theLebanese Museum. So, before leaving us, the Anunnaki activated in our cells theinfinitesimally invisible multimicroscopic gene of An-Hayya’h. It was implantedin our organism and became a vital composition of our DNA.Humans are not yet aware of this, as we were not aware of the existence of ourDNA for thousands of years.As our medicine, science and technology advance, we will be able one day todiscover that miniscule, invisible, undetectable An- Hayya’h, exactly as we havediscovered our DNA. An-Hayya’h cannot be detected yet in our laboratories.It is way beyond our reach and our comprehension.It is extremely powerful, because it is the very source of our existence.Through An-Hayya’h, the Anunnaki remained in touch with us, even though we arenot aware of it. It is linked directly to a Conduit and to a Miraya (Monitor, ormirror) on Nibiru. Every single human being on the face of the earth is linkedto the outer-world of the Anunnaki through An-Hayya’h. And it is faster than thespeed of light. It reaches the Anunnaki through Babs (Star gates). For now, wewill call it molecule or bubble. This molecule travels the universe and reachesthe Miraya of the Anunnaki through a Conduit integrated in our genes and ourbrain’s cells by the Anunnaki some 65,000 years ago. But what is a Conduit?Does every human possess a Conduit?The answer is yes.All humans have a Conduit just like the Anunnaki, because it is part of our DNA.It is impossible to explain how a Conduit works inside the human brain, and/orhow it works for a human being.The creation of the Conduit is the most important procedure done for eachAnunnaki’s student on the first day of his or her entrance into a learningcenter in Ashtari.A new identity is created for each Anunnaki’s student by the development of anew pathway in his or her mind, connecting the student to the rest of theAnunnaki’s psyche.Simultaneously, the cells check with the other copy of the mind and body of theAnunnaki student, to make sure that the Double and the other copy of the mindand body of the student are totally clean.During this phase, the Anunnaki’s student temporarily loses his or her memory,for a very short time. This is how the telepathic faculty is developed, or enhanced in everyone. It isnecessary, since to serve the total community of the Anunnaki, the individualprogram inside each Anunnaki’s student is immediately shared with everybody. The Anunnaki have two kinds of intelligence:1 -Collective intelligence that belongs to the community.2 -Individual intelligence that belongs to one person. Both intelligences are directly connected to two things:1 -The first is the access to the Community Depot of Knowledge that any Anunnakican tap in and update and acquire additional knowledge.2 -The second is an individual prevention shield, also referred to as personalprivacy.This means that an Anunnaki can switch on and off his/her direct link to otherAnunnaki. By establishing the Screen or Filter an Anunnaki can block others fromeither communication with him or her, or simply prevent others from readingpersonal thoughts. Filter, Screen and Shield are interchangeably used todescribe the privacy protection device.In addition, an Anunnaki can program telepathy and set it up on chosen channels,exactly as we turn on our radio set and select the station we wish to listen to.Telepathy has several frequency, channels and stations. When the establishmentof the Conduit is complete, the student leaves the conic cell, where theprocedure has taken place, and heads to the classroom. Now, how does an Anunnakireceive the content of a Conduit to allow him/her to watch over us? Through theMiraya (See Miraya to learn how it works). The Anunnaki created the Conduit, theMiraya and the An-Hayya’h to watch over us, even though we do not deserve it,said the Ulema.The Anunnaki have been watching us, monitoring our activities, listening to ourvoices, witnessing our wars, brutality, greed and indifference toward eachothers for centuries.But they did not interfere. But now, they will, because they fear two thingsthat could destroy earth and annihilate the human race:1 -The domination of earth and the human race by the Greys;2 -The destruction of human life and planet Earth on the hands of humans.The whole earth could blow up. Should this happen, the whole solar system couldbe destroyed. For we know, should anything happen to the moon, the earth willcease to exist. This is an absolute truth and a fact accepted by all scientists.So anything that could happen to earth will disrupt the solar system, said theUlema. An-Hayya’h is our umbilical cord, our birth cord that attaches us to theAnunnaki. Some refer to it as the “Silver Chord”.No matter how silly and crazy this concept might look to many of us, one day, wewill accept and possibly we might understand its mind-boggling mysteries, whenour science, technology and mind explore wider dimensions, and reach a higherlevel of cosmic awareness and intelligence, added the Ulema.Farid Tayarah said: “An-Hayya’h will always be there for you to use before youdepart this earth. It will never go away, because it is part of you. Without ityou couldn’t exist. Just before you die, your brain out of the blue willsactivate it for you.” Anh-Ista-Khan-na-reh: An Anunnaki’s medical/genetic term for women’simpregnation operation in Nibiru. The woman goes into a very nice hospital-likeplace. Anunnaki physicians will help her to lie down on a table, much like oneof the examination tables in any doctor’s office on earth.The attending physicians will be all females, very gentle and extremely skilled.Using a special machine, they will beam a light right through the woman’s body;the light will search for her ovaries. Nothing will probe, or hurt, or evenannoy the body.Once the light reaches the ovaries, it will activate one of the eggs, fertilizeit, and have it move very smoothly into the uterus.The woman then becomes pregnant, and the fetus will begin to grow.Anunnaki women have the egg removed by the light, placed in a special tube, andgrow the baby in a machine. They don’t have birth in the same sense humans do,but take the baby home after he or she is ready in the advanced incubator.This impregnation operation is called “An-Ista-Khan-na-reh”.It is composed from the following words:> • 1 -An’h=Creation; first; celestial.> • 2 -Ista or Ishtah=Child; baby; first born.> • 3 -Khan=hospital; operating room.> • 4 -Na=Source; first breath; first nourishment.> • 5 -Reh or Rah=Delivery; reception; relief.

It was the stage for a cosmic war between many ancient nations; thebirth of the Olympiads; and the world’s first Anunnaki-Phoenician medicalcenter. But recent archeological excavations on the Island of Arwad revealedthat this island gave birth to the Olympiads, and not Amrit as it was suggestedby historians. An.Mah.Rit was first used by Inanna when she created the first 7prototypes of the human race. Phoenicians used An-Mah-Rit quite often. It wassupplied by the priests of god Melkart.

Similar toAnšekunga “Anshekounga”. Anše “Anshe”: Noun. A d onkey. Anšedina “Anshedina”: Noun. The entire world.Similar to the Sumerian and Akkadian. An-šár “Anshar”. Anšeduba “Anshedooba” : Noun. Term.The entire hell; the several levels of the underworld.Note: It is defined in terrestrial terminology, and as it is used or understoodin the Akkadian/Sumerians clay tablets.“ Anšeduba is a metaphoric word, because the concept of hell does not exist inextraterrestrial literature and cosmology. Hell is the product of the humanmind, created by frightened and confused early humans, so-called prophets andpreachers.And promoted by organized religions for their own profit, and for establishingcontrol over the mind, the soul, and the body of duped followers…” said UlemaNejad.He added: “This takes me to questioning the identity and personality of thescribes and writers of the Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets…where they humans,messengers of the gods, or extraterrestrial Anunnaki who manifested themselveson earth as kings and builders of civilizations?The Akkadian/Sumerian epics mentioned the descent of gods and goddesses to theunderworld…this means one thing to me: The epics were written by humans andinspired by terrestrial beliefs…and rotated around physical beings, people fromflesh and blood who were human beings not the Anunnaki, the very advancedextraterrestrial race.The Anunnaki did not believe in hell, because hell exists only in the mind ofweakened and frightened human beings. This also makes me believe that thoseepics are neither the accumulation of historical facts, nor the accurate andentire story of the Anunnaki’s existence on Earth…they are simple poetry.” Anše-ishukur “Anshe-ishukoor”: Noun. Term.The entire creation.Creation means the creation of our solar system, the human race, animals, thephases planet Earth went through, and a primordial civilization that once livedon Mars.It does not refer to the entire creation of the universe. Ulema Lambrakis said:“Don’t let anybody convince you that the human mind is capable of understandingand/or discovering how the universe was created, simply because there are somany universes, and each one of them has its own properties, laws and unknownhistory.So what kind of universe are they talking about?” Anšekadu-ra abra “Anshekadoora” abra: Expression.Learning by traveling or traversing other dimensions.Composed of four words:a - Anše , which means magnificent.b- Kadu, which means ability, or to be able.c- Ra, which means heavenly; godly.d- Abra, which means to cross over; to traverse.Ulema Shimon Naphtali Ben Yacob explained that the Anunnaki have acquired anenormous amount of knowledge by entering different dimensions, and visiting amultitude of universes.These dimensions are sometimes called parallel universes, future universes, andvibrational spheres.He said: “Some are physical/organic, others are purely mental.There are billions and billions of universes.Some are inhabited by beings, super-beings, multi-vibrational beings, and evennegative entities known to mankind as demons and evils.Planet earth is considered the lowest organic and human life-form in theuniverse. The human beings are the less developed living entities, both mentallyand spiritually.”Anšekadu-ra abra also means Anunnaki’s branching out and changing individualityin multiple universes . To understand the concept, consider this scenario saidUlema Mordachai Ben Zvi: “Let say, you wish if you could do somethingdifferently in your life, something like changing the past, changing a majorlife decision you have made some years ago, like perhaps, going back in time toa point before you have made a bad decision.Or for instance, you wish if you could do something really good by changing anentire event that has happened in your past. In the Anunnaki’s case, they havethe solutions for these dilemmas. They can go back and forth in time and space,including the past, the future, and meta-future.An Anunnaki can split himself/herself in two, three, or more if necessary, andmove on to a universe that is very much like the one they live on (Nibiru), ortotally different.There are so many universes, and some of them do not resemble Nibiru at all. Ifan Anunnaki wishes to branch out and move on, he/she must study the matter verycarefully and make the right selection. And the branching, or splitting, resultsin exact copies of the person of the Anunnaki, both physically and mentally.At the moment of separation, each separate individual copy of an Anunnaki grows,mentally, in a different direction, follows his or her own free will anddecisions, and eventually the two are not exactly alike.” So what do they do,first of all?Ulema Ben Zvi said verbatim: “The old one stays where he/she is and followshis/her old patterns as he/she wishes. The new one might land one minute, or amonth, or a year, somewhere, some place, right before the decision he/she wantsto change or avoid.Let’s take this scenario for instance; Some 30,000 years ago in his life-span;an Anunnaki male was living a nice life with his wife and family. But he feltthat he did not accomplish much, and suddenly he wanted to be more active in thedevelopment of the universe; a change caused by witnessing a horrendous eventsuch as a certain group of beings in his galaxy destroying an entirecivilization, and killing millions of the inhabitants, in order to take overtheir planet for various purposes.It happened while an Anunnaki was on a trip, and he actually saw the destructionand actions of war while he was traveling. It was quite traumatic, and hethought, at that moment, that he must be active in preventing such events fromoccurring again, ever. So, he went back in time to be in a spot to prevent thesefateful events from happening again.There, in that new dimension, the Anunnaki leaves his former self (A copy ofhimself) as a guardian and a protector.The other copy (Perhaps one of the original ones) is still on Nibiru. Thebranching out phenomenon occurred in one of the designated locals of theAnunnaki Hall of Records, also called in terrestrial term Akashic Records Hall.”Ulema Openheimer said: “For the Anunnaki fellow there is no problem or anydifficulty in doing that. He/she will go back in time and space and change thewhole event. This means that this particular event no longer exists in achronological order. This also means that the event has been erased, because theAnunnaki can de-fragment the molecules, the substance, the vibrations and thefabric of time, but necessarily space. In other words, that event never happenedin one dimension, but it is very possible, that it might still exist in anotherworld.You could consider part of the cosmos are an assemblage of several layers ofuniverses, each one on the top of the other, and sometimes parallel to eachother. When the Anunnaki traverses more than two layers, we call thisAnšekadu-ra abra.”Can a human being traverse multiple layers of time and space?Yes, said Ulema Ben Zvi. He added: “However, the human being will be facing aseries of problems. For instance:1 -Case one: Although, he/she may cross over and enters another dimension, andsucceeds in altering, changing or even erasing a past event, the human beingmight get stuck in that dimension, and remains there for ever.In this condition, he/she is transformed into a new person without an identityor a past.A brand new person who is out-placed, without a job, without a residence,without credentials, and without social or professional context. It would becomevery difficult for that person to make a living.How the others would look upon him? A person from the past? A person from thefuture? It is not an easy situation.2 -Case two: Because everything in the world is duplicated ad infinitum in manyuniverses, only one copy of the past event has been altered.3 -Case three: What would happen to that person, should he/she decides to returnback…to his/her original world?The real problem here is not how to go back to his/her world and relive anordinary life, the life he/she had before, but what is going to happen tohim/her when he/she leaves the new dimension he/she has entered?Every time a person enters another dimension, he/she created a new copy ofhimself/herself, and occupies a new spot on the cosmos net. In our case here,that human being by entering another dimension, he/she has duplicatedhimself/herself in that new dimension, and returning to Earth, he/she will befacing another copy of himself/herself. “Is this possible? Quantum physic theorists say yes. And they add that humans canenter and live in multiple universes and acquire new identities, and new copiesof themselves.

The Ulema stated that two good examples of An-tasur-ra wouldbe Hajarat al Houbla in Baalbeck, and the face on Mars. Antasura: Noun. A stone. Anth-Khalka: Anunnaki-Ulemite term for the creation of the first humans.Composed of two words:> • a -An’th, which means race; people.> • b -Khalka, which means creation;birth.From An’th derived the Arabic word Ounth, which means people, humans, humanrace. And from Khalka, derived the Arabic word Khalika, which means creation ofthe human beings.Excerpts from Ulema’s Kira’at (Reading):Mankind was not created by one single Sumerian god. More than one Anunnakiparticipated in the creation of mankind.And contrary to a common belief, the Anunnaki were not the firstextraterrestrials and gods to create a human from clay.Many other deities from different pantheons created also man from clay. Forinstance, Khnum “Kneph” (Meaning: To build, to unify in Egyptian) was one of theoldest Egyptian gods who created mankind from clay on a potter's wheel.Khnum became a variation of Ptah. The Anunnaki first landed in Phoenicia wherethey established their first colonies, and short after, they created their mostelaborate medical center on the Island of Arwad, then a Phoenician territory.However, the Anunnaki ameliorated their genetic creations, and upgraded earlyhuman forms and primitive humans in their laboratories in Sumer.The Sumerian texts and their translations in western languages gave moreexposure to the Anunnaki of Sumer than to the other and equally powerfulAnunnaki of Phoenicia and Central Africa.The Sumerian texts include various versions of the creation of mankind by amultitude of Anunnaki’s gods and goddesses.Some passages in the Sumerian texts refer to different creators, as well as tomultiple genetic experiments.There is no reference to one singular genetic creation of the early human races,or a solid certainty to the fact that mankind was genetically created by onesingle god. In fact, a multitude of gods and goddesses created different typesand categories of human beings, to name a few:1 -Ninlil:Ninlil was the Sumerian “Queen Breeze”, was also called Aruru, Ninhursag,Ninhursanga, the Lady of The Mountains , the ruler of the heavens, underworld,wind, earth, and grain, wife of Enlil[http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:8Bxv4zQzq7gJ:www.palmyria.co.uk/superstition/godsfestivals.htm+phoenician+gods+who+created+mankind&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=17&gl=us#ea]and the mother of Nanna/Utu[http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:8Bxv4zQzq7gJ:www.palmyria.co.uk/superstition/godsfestivals.htm+phoenician+gods+who+created+mankind&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=17&gl=us#nanna]experimented with different forms and shapes of early human beings.

In several passages from the Akkadian-Sumerians clay tablets, she wasalso associated with Nana, who was called the “Progenitor of Modern Man”, andthe “Earth Mother Goddess.” Ninlil also created Endiku.In the Epic of Gilgamesh we read: “…she created mankind…so numerous…she thrusther hands into the waters and pinched off some clay, which she dropped in thewilderness, in the wilderness she made Endiku the hero…” and in another passage,it was written: \"My friend Endiku whom I loved has turned to clay… died,returned to the clay that formed him…”2 -MardukMarkuk was the son of Ea and husband of Sarpanitu, the sun-god, and also the godof war, fire, earth and heaven, and one of the major creators of heroes, godsand humans.

Sometimes, an urn (Tube, vessel, jar) appears on the slabs and seal cylinders asa reminder of the creation of Man in the Anunnaki’s test-tubes of the geneticexperiments that took place in the Anunnaki’s “Chimiti” lab.

Anubdada : Noun. The seven dimensions or planets visited by the Anunnaki, anddescribed in the Book of Rama-Dosh.It is understood by the adepts and the enlightened ones that the Anunnaki havevisited a great number of stars and planets. Their trip to planet Earth wasneither the only voyage they have made, nor the mot significant one.Ulema Sorenztein said: “As a matter of fact, their (Anunnaki) visit to Earth wasthe less significant one…you have to remember that at the dawn of the existenceof Earth, no civilizations were established, art did not exist, poetry was notwritten yet, science not found yet, in brief, an archaic form of life roamed itssurface and metamorphosed beneath…Thus, it is quite safe to assume that Earth at that time in history had littleto offer to very advanced galactic civilizations. So why did the Anunnaki landon Earth?There are of course many theories and assumptions on the subject. Fewarcheological remains and facts attest to their arrival, however, not alwaysauthoritative and convincing.But what is certain is the fact that the Anunnaki like so many otherextraterrestrial civilizations have visited other galactic systems andestablished some sort of relations and enterprises with other galacticsocieties. It was part of their routine activities and the very nature of theirexistence.So far, a few authors have suggested that the Anunnaki had extensive rapportswith aliens from Zeta Reticuli, but this is the tip of the iceberg. There arebillions upon billions of stars and planets in the universe, and Zeta Reticuliand Earth are but a dot on the cosmic map.The reason for mentioning the seven planetary systems or spheres in the Book ofRamadosh is not clear, but I think they were mentioned because at the beginningof time as we know it or understand it, the Anunnaki have opened Ba’abs(Stargates) that allowed them to zoom in the universe faster than the speed oflight.One of these gigantic Ba’abs was located not far from planet Earth. Anotherstargate was located near Mars. Between the two stargates, the Anunnaki createdthe Plasmic Belt, also known as the Spherical Shield. Two of the sevendestinations mentioned in the Book of Ramadosh were Mars and Earth.” Ánugia : Adjective. Also in Sumerian . Attractive. Anúmun: Noun. Reeds. Anumunsa: Watering the first plantation. Anun: Noun.a- A barn,b- A storage area,c- A storehouse. Anunna : Also in Sumerian and Akkadian. Noun. A collective name for the gods andgoddesses of earth and heaven. Anunnaki : Also in Sumerian, Assyrian and Akkadian. Noun.The word Anunnaki is composed of three words or more, depending on the choice oflinguists:> • 1- Anu, which is the name of the Anunnaki’s supreme god. And the> epistemological meaning of Anu is: Lord; leader; king.> • 2- Na, is either a verb or an adverb, meaning to send. In many Akkadian,> Sumerian, Assyrian and Old Babylonian texts and inscriptions, “Na” was written> as “Ina”, and meant in, from within, so on.> • 3- Ki, generally means Earth in Akkadian and Sumerian. But Ki also means all> of the following, in Akkadian and Sumerian: The underworld, the netherworld,> the world of death.The Akkadian/Sumerian Anunnaki word is used in a plural form to represent thegods of the heaven and Earth. They are represented as [Image00024.gif] a[Image00024.gif] amê (Sha Shame) u erSetim (Pronunciation: As Sha Shamehersetiim) meaning the Anunnaki of heaven and earth. [Image00024.gif] a[Image00024.gif] amê means heaven in Akkadian and Sumerian. Shem and shama inPhoenician, and Sama in Arabic. erSetim means earth. Thus, the Anunnaki andIgigi are grouped together under Anunna. B[Image00064.gif] abylonia, land of the Anunnaki, when it was captured by thePersians[Image00065.jpg] Anunnaki gods around the Tree of Life.________________________________________ Later on in history, and in order to differentiate between the Anunnaki and theIgigi, The scribes called the Anunnaki, the gods of Earth, also gods of thenetherworld, and gods of the Empire of Death, and the Igigi, gods of the Heaven.This differentiation is very clear in all the Mesopotamian clay tablets,particularly in the Ishtar Descent to the Underworld (Ki), the poem/myth ofGilgamesh, the Enuma Elish, etc…Other names of the Anunnaki: The Anunnaki were known to many neighboringcountries in the Near East, Middle East, and Anatolia.And because of the languages’ differences, the Anunnaki were called differently.For instance: > • 1 -The Habiru (Early Hebrews/Israelites) called them Nephilim, meaning to> fall down to earth, as well as Anakim.> • 2 -Some passages in the Old Testament refer to them as Elohim.> • 3 -In Ashuric (Assyrian-Chaldean), and Syriac-Aramaic, they are called> Jabaariyn, meaning the mighty ones.> • 4 -In Aramaic, Chaldean and Hebrew, the Anunnaki as Gibborim mean the mighty> or majestic ones.> • 5- In literary Arabic, it is Jababira. The early Arabs called them Al> Jababira; sometimes Amalika.> • 6- The Egyptians called them Neteru.> • 7- The early Phoenicians called them An.Na Kim, meaning the god or heaven> who sent them to us.> • 8 -The early inhabitants of Arwad called then Anu.ki, meaning the subjects> or followers of Anu. Sometimes, they were called Anu. Ki.ram. (Ram means> people, persons, community, tribes, group)> • 9- The early Hyksos (Ancestors of the Armenians) who invaded and ruled Egypt> for 100 years, called them the Anuramkir and Anuramkim, meaning the people of> Anu on earth. It is composed of three words: Anu + ram (People) + Ki (Earth).> The primitive form of Ki was kir or kiim.> • 10- The Greeks called them the Annodoti.> • 11- the Book of Enoch, they are called The Nephilim, \"The Sons of God,\" or> the “Watchers”.> • 12 -The Ulema call them Annakh or Al Annaki, meaning the people from above.> • 13 -In other parts of Anatolia, and especially in the lands of the Hittites,> the Anunnaki were also called Anunnaku , and Ananaki . *** *** *** [Image00066.gif] View of ancient Babylonia._____________________________> > According to several linguists, the word Anunnaki is a loan word (Plural only)from Sumerian a.nun “n-a-k”, meaning literarily : semen/descendants of the (Ak)monarch (Nun) and refers to the offspring of the king of heaven An/Anum.Considered as a group of Akkadian and Sumerian deities, quite often, theAnunnaki were associated with the Annunna, meaning the fifty great gods. Annunawas written in various forms, such as:> • a- A-nun-na,> • b -Anu-na,> • c -Anuma-ki-ni,> • d -Anu-na-ki. Various attributes or definitions were given to them, such as:> • a -Major gods in comparison to the Igigi who were considered minor gods.> • b -Those of a royal blood or ancestry.> • c -The royal offspring,> • d -The great gods of heaven and earth. An means heaven, and ki means earth.The Annunaki appeared in the Babylonian creation myth/epic, “ Enuma Elish[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish] ” . In the late version, glorifyingMarduk [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marduk] , after the creation of mankind,Marduk divides the Anunnaki and assigns them to diverse parts of the earth.According to later Babylonian myth[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mythology] s, the Anunnaki were thechildren of Anu [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu] and Ki[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki_%28goddess%29] , brother and sister gods,themselves the children of Anshar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshar] andKishar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishar] (Skypivot and Earthpivot).Anshar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshar] and Kishar[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishar] were the children of Lahm and Lahmu[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahmu] , names/titles bestowed upon thegatekeepers of the Abzu [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu] temple at Eridu. Anunnaki ME.nou-Ra “ MEnour”: Noun. ME.nou-Ra is a sort of a light (Plasmalaser) used by the Anunnaki to purify the body and thoughts.All Anunnaki students entering the classroom in an Anunnaki academy must purifytheir bodies and minds. The purification exercise occurs inside a small room,entirely made of shimmering white marble. In the middle of the room, there is abasin, made of the same material, and filled with a substance called Nou-RahShams; an electro-plasma substance that appears like liquid-light. It actuallymeans, in Ana’kh, the Liquid of Light. Nou, or Nour, or sometimes Menour, orMenou-Ra, means light.Shams means sun.Nour in Arabic means light.The Ulema in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon use the same word in their openingceremony. Sometimes, the word Nour becomes Nar, which means fire. This isintentional, because the Ulemas, like the Phoenicians, believed in fire as asymbolic procedure to purify the thoughts. Anunnaki.Nou-Rah-Shams .“ Menora-Shems”: Noun. Also in Hebrew, Phoenician,Arabic, Akkadian and Aramaic. It is the Anunnaki’s Liquid-Light; anelectro-plasma substance that appears like luminous watery substance. In Ana’kh,Menou-Ra actually means the following: Nou, or Nour, or sometimes Menour,representing light.It has the same meaning in many Semitic languages. The Ulema, like thePhoenicians, believed in fire as a symbolic procedure to purify the thoughts.This created the word Min-Nawar, meaning the enlightened or surrounded withlight.If you know any Hebrew, you might remember that Menorah means a lamp. It’s allconnected. Later, the Illuminati used it as well. Anunnakifalak “Dounia”: Noun.Also in Akkadian and Arabic. The universe of the Anunnaki.Excerpt for a Kira’at (Reading) by Ulema: As far as humans are concerned, thereare two Anunnaki’s worlds:1- Sama,2-Falak.According to the Ulema, the first world is the Sama. The second world is theFalak, or Dounia: Falak “Dounia” is not a physical world. No living human beingsas physical creatures live in this second world.“You have to remember that physical objects including human beings cannot entera non-physical world, unless their molecules are reduced to a lower level ofvibrations…” said Ulema Al Bakri.“Thus, Falak “Dounia” is not a world where human beings could live with theirphysical bodies. Falak “Dounia” is the world of the human mind. The human mindwas created by the Anunnaki. The human mind can manifest itself as the Double ofa physical body…” explained Ulema Raja Shinkar.Falak consists of seven different “Woujoud”, meaning existences. Three of theseWoujoud already exist in a physical-nonphysical sphere of illusion, called“Kha-Da’h”.Planet earth is one of these three existences. But these three existences do notcount as meaningful dimensions. This is why we start counting with the Fourthdimension as the first sphere of Falak.a- The first Woujoud is known to us as the Fourth dimension, and it is called“Nafis-Ra”.b- The second Woujoud is known to us as the Fifth dimension, and it is called“Fik’r-Ra”.c- The third Woujoud is known to us as the Sixth dimension, and it is called“Kadosh-Ra” or “Koudous-Ra”.d- The fourth Woujoud is known to us as the Seventh dimension, and it is called“Khalek-Ra”.In other words, the Falak is the world of human beings who continue to livethrough their mind. Extraterrestrials of a very high vibrational state couldshare this sphere with the purified mind of humans (The deceased ones). Falakstarts as soon as we die. It is neither outside nor inside our solar system, andno light years separate humans from any dimension or state of existence inFalak. Some Bashar (Human beings) have already reached different vibrationallevels and spheres in Falak “Dounia”. Anunnaki-Sama.“Shama”: Noun. Also in Akkadian, Arabic, Aramaic and Syriac.One of the other dimensions of the Anunnaki.Excerpt for a Kira’at by Ulema: As far as humans are concerned, there are twoAnunnaki’s worlds: “Sama” and “Falak”.The first world is the Sama: It exists while humans are still alive on planetearth.Sama is the extraterrestrial world, where the Anunnaki and otherextraterrestrial races live. Sama existed in the universe billions of yearsbefore planet earth and the human race were created. Sama is a physical world.Its atmospheric properties vary from one planet to another planet, and from onestar to another star.For instance, Ashtari (Nibiru to others) has quasi-similar earth’s atmosphere,however the air is denser, the climate is heavier, the days are longer, and ithas four celestial objects orbiting it. Although humans could live on Ashtari(Nibiru, to others), certain surgical operations are needed to allow the humanbody to adapt to the new atmospheric conditions and environment on Ashtari.So, the physical world of the Anunnaki would allow humans to continue to liveoutside planet earth, and inhabit Ashtari. You could call Sama the bodily worldof humans, because humans can travel to Sama and live on Sama as physicalcreatures.Sometimes we refer to Sama as “Maddi”, meaning the physical dimension outsideplanet earth. And Maddi has living conditions almost similar to those on planetearth. Maddi has weather, trees, lakes, plains, mountains, cities, streets, etc.In other words, the Sama is the world of the living human beings, andextraterrestrials. It starts outside our solar system; billions of light yearsseparate planet earth from Sama. Bashar or Naas (Human beings) have not reachedSama yet. But extraterrestrials have reached planet earth some 500,000 years ago(More or less). Some extraterrestrial races are still on planet earth, and haveoffspring and descendants living among us. Anunnaki-Shabka : Also in Akkadian, Sumerian, Phoenician and Arabic. Expression.The name of a spatial web or net.It is composed of Anunnaki+Shabka (Net).Net should be understood as a matrix.Excerpt for a Kira’at (Reading) by Ulema: The Anunnaki Matrix is many thingsindeed. It is larger than anything the human mind could possibly imagine. Itcontains the entire past, present and future of multiple dimensions andcivilizations, including planet Earth, and the human races. Ulema Rushdi AnafawiTakiyeddine said: “There are three matrices known to mankind:1 -The Anunnaki’s Matrix;2 -The Ulema’s Matrix;3 -The Humans’ Matrix.”Ulema Raji Khandar said: “Each matrix has its own dimensions, contents, andscope. However, the Anunnaki’s matrix includes the Ulema’s matrix, the Ulema’smatrix includes the humans’ matrix, and the humans’ matrix includes exclusivelyour habitat on planet Earth.”This matrix is extremely complicated, because it is written in codes, symbols,geometrical forms, chemical formulas, theorems, and in all the languages thathave existed, still exist, and will be invented in the future after 2022,according to the Ulema. In other words, it is a cosmic library, archives, anddepository of all the knowledge and events of 5 billions years, the estimateddate of the beginning of the universe.According to the Ulema, and Al-Munawarin, the Anunnaki’s matrix’ scientificdata/registry contain all the explanations of the creation of our universe(Solar system, all stars, planets and galaxies known to us.) Included in thedata/registry are detailed descriptions and explanations of:1 -Primordial bio-engineering of terrestrial life (Elements, nature, animals,and humans.)2 -Building blocks of life, and how they acted like cells to produce life onearth.3 -DNA’s fifth unknown element.Ulema AlKhabir said: “So far, scientists on earth have discovered 4 elements inour DNA: Cytosine, Thymine, Adenine and Guanine. In the Anunnaki’s Matrix, thereis a fifth element called “I-Bra.Ah”, meaning transcending time and space in theAna’kh language.”The Ulema coined it “Niktat Alkhou-Lood”, and it means verbatim: The point ofthe beginning of immortality. In other words, the fifth element is responsiblefor an extraordinary longevity of mankind on earth, and/or its immortality. Itis very possible said an Ulema that after 2022, humans will learn about thesecret of immortality, but will never be able to decode the composition andsequences of the fifth element.“It would be a catastrophe for humanity and for the future of planet earth, ifhumans succeed in decoding the data contained in the fifth element…” said UlemaBenadar Gupta.Many Ulema are not seriously worried, because with the arrival of the Anunnakiin 2022, the existence of human life and its continuity will be in the hands ofthe Anunnaki, according to Ulema Gupta.4 -RNA and Life Evolution: In addition to the DNA, the Anunnaki’s matrix givesdetailed information about the RNA, which is a ribonucleic acid, a close cousinof deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.The Anunnaki’s matrix includes a fifth base in the RNA chain, and it is calledin Ana’kh “Ta-Tawur-Ankh”.The Ulema interpreted it as the “Evolution of life on earth”. The Anunnakiexplained how this fifth base created the primordial molecules that duplicatedthemselves and consequently started the life evolution cycles on planet Earth. Anur: Noun. Illuminated horizon of the deity. Anuraš “Anuras”: Noun. The universe. Anusan : Noun. Evening. Anzag, an-zà: Also in Sumerian and Akkadian. The end of the universe; where theworld comes to an end.

Anzu was always depicted as a demonic figure with eagle’s widewings, and ferocious lion’s pawns. In the Sumerian language, Anzu was spelledImdugud; it was only later found that his name was pronounced Anzu, or Zu.One day, while Ellil was bathing, Anzu stole the Tablets of Destiny and fled tothe desert. These tablets had magical powers, and the person who owns thembecomes capable of ruling the universe, and deciding upon the fate of others. Eapersuaded the mother-goddess Belet-Ili to give birth to a divine hero to defeatAnzu. [Image00067.jpg] Scene from the Epic of Gilgamesh showing Enkidu on the left with a spear, and onthe right Gilgamesh killing the bird-man Anzu, with a dagger._______________________________ Belet-Ili produced Ninurta and sent him into battle.After a huge fight, Ninurta pierced Anzu's chest with an arrow, and recapturedthe Tablets. Anzu is usually depicted as evil, however, in the Sumerian epic ofLugalbanda , Anzu is kind, gentle and entertaining. Later on, the Tablets ofDestiny were seized by Marduk.

The calendar of the eight month of theyear, used in the city of Nippur. Apindugari: Noun. Union (Matrimony) between an Anunnaki male and an Anunnakifemale.The union is of a non-physical nature. In terrestrial term it is a sort of amarriage. But the union ceremony is brief, and it occurs through the process ofNoura, or the mixing of two lights.In the book “Anunnaki Ultimatum. End of Time: Autobiography and ExplosiveRevelations of a Human Anunnaki Hybrid”, co-authored by Ilil Arbel andMaximillien de Lafayette, there is chapter describing the “Mingling of Lights”that occur during an Anunnaki’s wedding ceremony. It is informative and quiterevealing. Herewith excerpts from that chapter:Note: Ambar Anati is an Anunnaki female hybrid (Half Anunnaki half human). Sheis the fiancee of Sinhar Marduk, an Anunnaki leader, and soon to be married tohim. Here, she is talking to Marduk’s sister about the wedding procedures andpreparation. Anati has been informed by her that Anunnaki marriages are quitedifferent from humans’ marriages, because a sort of plasmic light is involved inthe matrimony process. The marriage is not consumed via a sexual act, butthrough “Mingling Lights”.The article goes like this:“He did not exactly explain to me, but I suspect he is indeed apprehensive. Heis probably not sure if you know how we are constructed, physically, and whatour marriages are really like. I mean, of course you know about the Union, themingling of lights, but are you aware that Anunnaki do not have sex organs likehumans?”“Of course I am aware of it. I saw a whole lot of little children swimming inthe ponds, quite naked, when you took me to our swimming trips.I know exactly how you are constructed physically.”“Well, does it bother you?”“Why should it? Miriam, the night before I left, your brother gave me a tinysample of the mingling of lights. Nothing much, we just held hands and keptapart when he activated our lights, so it involved only the hands.That was all he thought would be appropriate and fair to my free will. So Irespected that, but let me tell you, this slight touch was better, a millionlight years better, than any sexual activity we have on earth.”“So it would not hurt you in any way that as the centuries go by, and you becomemore and more an Anunnaki, you will lose the sex organs?”“I would not bat an eyelash.”“You know, Victoria, I believe that your Anunnaki genes influence youconsiderably already.”“Quite possibly. Also, you must understand that single women in my world usuallyexperiment with sex from their late teens and on. I had a couple of experiencesin my twenties.”“Well, I must say I am glad Sinhar Marduchk is too ethical to have spied on you.He would not have enjoyed these experiments, I suspect.”“He might have been made rather happy about them, Miriam. They were nothing tome. Something inside me retained the memory of the mingling of lights withMarduchk, because I really did not like any of these men or what they tried togive me. Sex, as I told an old earth friend just before you brought me hereagain, is highly overrated… After experiencing the mingling of the lights, it isa minor thing indeed, a mere physical sensation at best. I don’t have to tellyou that the mingling of lights involve mind, body, and soul. Just don’t tellthat to Marduchk… he might feel I needed thirty more years to make sure my freewill is intact, and I am NOT waiting to be sixty before I marry.”“Since I have never experienced sex in the earth way, or ever had sex organs, ofcourse I can’t tell the difference. The mingling of lights, to me, is highlyspiritual.But do you know, Victoria, that your species is the only humanoid one in theknown universes that has sex organs, which were given to you to match theanimals and the plants on your planet? I personally think it was a mistake, itdeprived you of true unity with your mates and created much frustration. Noother species share this aberration. Anyway, I am so glad you feel this way,Victoria. I have looked upon you as my sister from the moment you came here thefirst time, and I would not want to lose you to the earthlings.”In the following passage, Ambar Anati is telling us what happened next, and whatdid she talk about with her husband to be, Sinhar Marduk. Excerpt from the book:“In the morning, Marduchk came early. I was in the garden, waiting for him,while everyone else was still in their rooms. The morning was beautiful,butterflies fluttered in the dense flower beds and every tree was full ofsinging birds.The roses were blooming so intensely that their scent was incredibly strong. Ifelt that the occasion meant a lot to both of us, even if I had no idea what wasto take place, so I dressed in a semi-formal fashion, and wore a longcream-colored dress with a beautiful red belt.Marduchk seemed to have had the same thought, since he, too, wore something thatseemed more afternoon than morning to me. He was glad to see me up already andasked me to come to the library.Inside, he approached a shelf, but instead of using one of the usual conicalbooks, he removed an ancient wooden box and brought it to one of the tables.Inside was a scroll that seemed ancient, probably hundreds, if not thousands ofyears old. “Is this Egyptian papyrus?” I asked.“Yes, it is. A few thousand years ago, we had to copy the original manuscript.It lasted for eons, but finally it was beginning to crumble. We decided wewanted to make an exact replica, since it was so beautiful, rather thanreproduce it on a cone, as many families do.” It was truly beautiful, written ina language I could not understand and illuminated with small, magical pictures,many of them seemingly some kind of symbols. I longed to touch it and see whatthe texture was, but I did not dare to do so.“This is our marriage record book where all our marriages are kept. Now is thetime to make your final decision, Victoria, if you can. Will you marry me?”“Of course I will,” I said, surprised. “Did you have any doubts about it?”“I have to ask you formally, no matter what I think. It is part of theceremony.”“Marduchk, I know nothing about it. Would you please explain to me what theceremony is all about?”“It has four parts. The first is a verbal consent and a statement of free will.The second is signing the marriage record. The third is the mingling of thelights. The fourth is a conclusive ceremony officiated by a representative ofthe Council.”“And a party?With beautiful dresses, and music, and food?”Marduchk laughed. “Of course,” he said. “Right after the ceremony.”“Then let’s get on with it, Marduchk!It’s not all solemnity, you know, we should have some fun!” Marduchk smiled.“Indeed,” he said. “We shall now continue, then. Let’s start again. Will youmarry me?”“Yes, I will marry you, Marduchk.”“Are you certain, and ready to sign this book?”“I am certain.”“Can you see, imagine, visualize, or even fantasize any other option than ourmarriage?”“No, I cannot.”“And do you realize, that once you sign this book our union is irrevocable?”“I realize that.”“Is anything other than complete free will ever employed in your consent? Wasany form of persuasion, coercion, promises, or any other such behavior employedon my part?”“There is only free will.”Marduchk unrolled the scroll and picked up a writing implement from the table.It was shaped like a pen, but from previous experience, I knew it worked withenergy, not ink. Nothing could erase it, ever. Under a text paragraph, he signedhis name in the Anunnaki language. He then handed me the pen, and I signed myname, in plain English. To my surprise, each of our signatures, though done bythe same pen, had a different color. And what’s more, under my English signatureappeared what seemed to be a translation into Anunnaki, but it kept mysignature’s color.“Are we married now?” I asked.“Yes, we are. For eternity.” He seemed suddenly relaxed.“And then, can I move to your house? Or do I stay at Miriam’s house like a nicelittle virgin until the Council blesses me?”“No, you move to my house. It is now your house, we are married.”“It’s about time,” I said, and we both laughed.Everyone congratulated us when we came back to Miriam’s living room. They wereall there, waiting for us.“And now we must take your things to your home,” said Miriam, after a goodbreakfast, where everyone was relaxed, happy, and full of plans.“Would you believe your husband would not allow me to take your dresses, all theaccessories my daughters designed, shoes, and all the jewelry, until after themarriage was accomplished?I knew you will stay, but he just won’t allow it, tiresomely refereeing again tofree will…but we will try to forget his annoying ways.We will take everything now, or teleport it, rather, into your closets. Come seeall the stuff.”“He does stick to tradition,” I said, following her out of the room.“Ah, well,” said Miriam with resignation. “We must accept the fact that all overthe known universes, the female of the species is more realistic.”Marduchk heard us, and laughed. “Very true,” he said. “Wait one second,Victoria. Once the ceremony and celebrations are all over, where would you liketo go for our wedding trip?”“Why, Paris, of course,” I said. “Where else would one go for a honeymoon?”“What a charming idea,” said Miriam. “I was thinking about a planet on the AlphaCentauri system where so many people go for their wedding trips, but Paris willbe very nice.”The wardrobe they prepared for me was so incredible, I had to gasp. Closet aftercloset, full with the most beautiful gowns for all occasions, from casual toformal. Entire shelves full of shoes in all colors, accessories that wereeverything from hair decorations to belts and scarves, and jewelry that can onlybe described as breath taking. “Later, we must decide on the wedding dress,”said Miriam. “I have about six or seven for you to choose from.”After I could finally manage to tear myself away from the enchanting wardrobe,everything was quickly teleported without the slightest physical effort, andfinally Miriam and Marduchk took me to my new home to get settled.Marduchk’s home, which, as I have explained before, was attached with a corridorto his sister’s home, was just as beautiful and comfortable as Miriam’s. Iremembered it from my last visit, since of course I have seen it many times, butit turned out that the brother and sister decided to change everything and makeit perfect for a new bride, more elegant, less masculine. The theme they decidedupon was an indoor garden.The living room retained the structure of smooth levels and high ceiling, ofcourse, but it was now filled to the brim with indoor roses, both bushes andtrailing, and parts of the floor grew the softest, greenest grass wherepreviously they were covered with carpets. Other trailing and hanging floweringplants undulated with the soft breeze that came from the opened windows, makingthe room look like a miniature magical forest. Tiny ponds, surrounded with fernsand supporting water lilies were on every level, with miniature waterfallstwinkled delicately as they softly fell into the ponds.Tall willow-like trees and bamboo grew behind the furniture. The couches wereall covered with green and gold silk, and the red hibiscus flowers here andthere completed the enchanting color scheme. This was the most beautiful room Ihave ever seen. The dining room, the guest rooms, the bedrooms all followed thegarden theme. Each guest room was decorated with a different flower theme, oneof them all lilies of the valley like flowers, another one like a orchard offlowering plums and almonds. The bathrooms were small rainforests.Our bedroom was Zen like, with the bed in the middle and a few trees behind itand before it. A couple of small tables had each a vase with one white lily, andall the storage for clothes and beddings was hidden behind wooden screens.One large pond with papyrus growing right in it was placed in a corner, and wassurrounded with gray, moss-covered rocks. It was a place of serenity and peace.As Miriam and Marduchk were conducting the tour of the house, I simply could notstop admiring and exclaiming over everything. It felt to me like something of achildhood’s dream or fairy tale. “I am so happy you like it,” said Miriam.“After you live in it for awhile, you may want some changes, some things to makeit more comfortable or more suitable for your personal taste. Nothing will beeasier. You will tell me, and I’ll teach you how to manipulate objects with yourmind.”“For the moment, I don’t want to even think of changes,” I saidenthusiastically. “What a place…”“And now I must go and let you settle. Come for lunch tomorrow, and we’ll choosethe dress.” She left and Marduchk and I were left in our home, finally marriedand alone in this green paradise. We were now free to bring about our Union andmingle our lights.Marduchk stood up and said most formally, “Victoria, would you do me the honorof accomplishing our Union? This will be the third part of our marriage.”Tears came into my eyes. “Do you the honor, Marduchk? No, you are doing me thehonor. You, and your family who accepted me as one of them, and the Council whois willing to bless our marriage despite the fact that I am, truly, a member ofan inferior species. I am honored.”“You are not an inferior, Victoria. You are one of us in every way. You havebeen brought up on earth, and that changed a few things, but nothingfundamental. Your genetic makeup is ours, and most important, your spirit andyour soul are ours. And the Council will prove it to you by honoring you, duringthe wedding ceremony, by giving you your very own Anunnaki name.”“The greatest honor is your wanting to marry me, Marduchk, waiting for me, andallowing me the centuries of learning and growing to be like you.And to answer your question, in the formal style that is needed, yes, I will nowhappily come with you and accomplish our Union.”There are certain things that cannot be described, things that human languagehas no words for, and I am afraid that the mingling of the lights is one ofthem. I can describe the physical procedure – and unlike human sexual behavior,there is nothing in the Union that is embarrassing or disturbing to even themost traditional and old-fashioned people, but the experience itself isimpossible to relate.We went into our bedroom, which traditionally had no windows. That is because itis not seemly to have the lights, which can be intense, be seen by people whomay be walking in the gardens. We sat on the bed, and I said to Marduchk, “Ihave no idea how the lights are to be activated.”“You don’t have to do anything, since the lights are not activated. They emanatefrom our beings, and just sitting here together will do it. Do you remember howthe light grew around our hands, just before you left?”“Of course I do,” I said. I did not want to add that the experience lived in mymind, if unconsciously so, enough to make me come back to him. So I kept it tomyself and smiled inwardly with complete happiness.“Just sit near me, Victoria, close your eyes, and imagine the same lightemanating from your entire body.” I did as he said, and imagined golden lightsurrounding me like a soft, flowing veil. For a few minutes nothing happened,and then I felt a change and opened my eyes to see each of us surrounded by abubble of the most brilliant light.The bubbles came together, touched each other exactly like floating soap bubblesdo, and merged together into one glowing orb. The light grew stronger andstronger until the whole room was illuminated by undulating, flowing strands oflight, a little like the strands that can be seen in the sky during the auroraborealis. And the sensations I felt were the incarnation of beauty, at oncemental, physical, and spiritual, since it cannot be anything but a combinationof the three, and it mounted and increased until the light exploded into ashower of stars and the Union was achieved.And that is all I can really say, because as I said, human language is toolimited. In Anunnaki, there are many words to describe the Union in all itsaspects.I do want you to understand, though, I am doing my best. So if you can recallthe most wonderful romantic experience you ever had, with someone for whom youhad pure love and respect, perhaps you may have inkling, but only that. Isuspect that until humans evolve mentally, spiritually, and physically, untilsuch time as they can shed all the negative traits of infidelity, jealousy, andfickleness, all they can have is a pale imitation of the Union. I hope that someday it will happen, because the Union, unlike the human sexual relation, canonly ennoble and enrich you, can never be negative, can never cause pain orembarrassment. It is the essence of purity and happiness.After all was over, and we were resting on our bed, I told Marduchk that Iremember smelling the scent of a certain flower I remember from my childhood,which grew only in the hothouses. Marduchk was sure it was part of theexperience, and tried to understand which flower it was, but I forgot the name,and could not describe it to him adequately. So Marduchk smiled and said, “Well,make a shower of these flowers fall on us.”“Make a shower of flowers? Me? How do I do that? Don’t you forget I am a merehuman?”“Having gone through the Union already started you on developing special powers.Just close your eyes, and imagine the flowers, as you remember them, falling onus like a steady rain from the ceiling. Make heaps and heaps of them.” I laughedat the idea, but to indulge him, I closed my eyes and imagined the flowers doingthat. Suddenly I felt something landing on me softly, like a snowflake. I openedmy eyes, and to my total amazement I saw a few flowers falling from the ceiling.White and yellow and smelling like an earthly paradise, the rain of flowers gotthicker and thicker and they covered us with their scented petals. I wasspeechless with amazement at my new gifts and the impossibility of what I wascreating, but Marduchk just picked up one flower and said in a totalmatter-of-fact way, as if no miracle had been taking place, “Oh, I see,Plumeria. Of course. I should have recognized them from your description; theygrow here all over the place.” I laughed.“What next?” I said. “Will I fly to one of the moons on my own silver wings?”Marduchk looked at me seriously and said, “Sure, if you like. There are nolimits, really…wings are easy enough to make, any color you want.” What a place,I thought, what a life… and I sank into a blissful sleep under the soft and warmblanket of the delicate while and yellow flowers.” Apkallu : Also in Akkadian and Sumerian.

Basically, it means your “other name”; the name you did not know youhad. Ulema Bashir Bin AlFakhri As-Soufi explained this concept as follows, (Fromhis Kiraat, Addendum to the Book of Rama-Dosh):Author’s note: Translated verbatim, word for word, unedited, to preserve itsauthentic cach é .1 -Your parents gave you a name when you were born. That is your physical name.The name of your body, yourself and the link to your family.2 -This name may influence your fate.3- If your name contains one of the 72 powerful words of the Al Khalek(Creator), then you will be lucky, and you will prosper in life.4 -If your name does not have any of the 72 powerful names of Al Khalek, youwould live like all the other people; no special treatment from the providencewill be given to you.5 -But what you did not know is that the name given to you by your parents isnot the only name you have received in this mortal sphere.6 -There is another name that it has been given to you by a higher authority.This is your real name, because it contains all your attributes, including thelucky dates, the map of your future, and the powers you can use to stop dangersand threats.7 -We call this name “Ism Al Ghayra Manzour”, or “Ghayra Al Ma’rouf”, meaningthe unseen name, or the unknown name.8 -This name links you to your origin.9 -This name attaches you to your mind, or to your soul.10 -This name unites you with Al Khalek.11 -Our brothers the Jews, I mean the elder Jewish scholars knew about theunheard, unseen and the unknown name. This is why – some of the reasons – theyalways give a Hebrew/Jewish name to foreign Jews who were not born in Israel, ordo not speak Hebrew. Every Jewish person has two names; one name given to him byhis parents, and another Hebrew name given to him by others, either a Rabbi, oreven relatives.12 -After a purification ceremony, one of our brothers will find your hiddenname.13 -If that name is a lucky name. You will keep it, and you will remember it.14 -If that name is an unlucky name, the Ulema brother will change it, and willgive you a new name.15 -Our languages on earth are a great gift from Al Khalek.16 -Only developed minds can create and enjoy a language.17 -In the other dimension, where you came from, you already have a name. It iswritten in Ana’kh language, because you were created by the first creativesource of the Anunnaki.18 -If you are from Sudan, do not expect to find a Sudanese name in the otherdimension.19 -If you are from Alexandria, do not expect to find an Alexandrani name in theother dimension.20 -You will only find your name in Ana’kh.21 -Your teacher will find it for you… Arallu: Also in Babylonian, Akkadian, Chaldean and Sumerian.

Arawadi: A term for the supernatural power or faculty that allows initiated onesto halt or send away problems and mishaps into another time and another place. Avery complex concept that touches metaphysics, esoterism and quantum physics.Ulema Stephanos Lambrakis said that it is very possible to get rid of currentproblems by “transposing” them into a different time frame.He added that “all of us live in two separate dimensions so close to us. One weknow and we call it our physical reality, the other is the adjacent dimensionthat surrounds our physical world.Enlightened ones visit that dimension quite frequently. It is a matter of a deepconcentration, and perseverance. In fact, it is possible to enter that paralleldimension and leave there all your troubles, and return to your physical worldfree of worries and problems.” Araya: Noun. Term.a- Prediction,b- Code.According to the Ulema, the Anunnaki’s Araya is an effective tool to foreseeforthcoming events in the immediate and long term future. The expression or term“foreseeing” is never used in the Ana’kh language and by extraterrestrialsbecause they don’t foresee and predict. They just calculate and formulate.In spatial terms, they don’t even measure things and distances, because time andspace do not exist as two separate “presences” in their dimensions.However, on Ashta.Ri (Nibiru to others), Anunnaki are fully aware of all thesevariations, and the human concept of time and space, and have the capability ofseparating time and space, and/or combining them into one single dimension, orone single frame of existence.Anunnaki understand time differently from us, said the Ulema. For instance, onNibiru, there are no clocks and no watches. They are useless. Then you mightask: So, how do they measure time? How do they know what time it is…now or 10minutes later, or in one hour from now? The answer is simple: If you don’t needtime, you don’t need to measure it.However, on Nibiru, Anunnaki experience time and space as we do on earth. Andthey do measure objects, substances, distances and locations as we do on earth.But they rarely do.“The Anunnaki (In addition to the Nordics and Lyrans) are the only knownextraterrestrials in the universe to look like humans, and in many instances,they share several similarities with the human race…” said Ulema Ghandar.This physiognomic resemblance explains to a certain degree, the reason forAnunnaki to use time. To calculate and formulate information and to acquiredata, Anunnaki consult the Code Screen. Consulting the screen meanspragmatically, the reading of events sequences, explained the Ulema.Every single event in the cosmos in any dimension has a code; call it for nowNimera, a “number”, added the Ulema. Nothing happens in the universe without areason.The universe has its own logic that the human mind cannot understand. In manyinstances, the logic of numbers dictates and creates events. And not all createdevents are understood by the extraterrestrials.This is why they resort to the Araya Code Screen. Activating the Araya Coderequires four actions or procedures:1 -Taharim:This demands clearing all the previous data stored in the “pockets” of the Net.A net resembles space net as usually used by quantum physics scientists. They doin fact compare space to a net. According to their theories, the net as thelandscape of time and space bends under the weight of a ball rotating at amaximum speed. The centrifugal effect produced by the ball alters the shape ofthe net, and consequently the fabric of space. And by altering space, timechanges automatically.As time changes, speed and distances change simultaneously. Same principleapplies to stretching and cleaning up the net of the screen containing amultitude of codes of the Anunnaki.2 -Location of the Pockets:The word pockets means the exact dimension and a space an object occupies on theuniverse’s net or landscape. No more than one object or one substance occupiesone single pocket; this is by earth standard and human level of knowledge. Inother parallel words, more than one object or one substance can be infused inone single pocket. But this could lead to loss of memory. Objects and substanceshave memory too, just like human beings; some are called:a -Space memory,b -Time memory,c -String memory,d -Astral memory,e -Bio-organic memory,etc…The list is endless.Thus, all pockets containing previous data are cleared.3- Feeding the Pockets, also called Retrieving Data: All sorts and sizes of dataare retrieved and stored through the Conduit.The Conduit is an electroplasmic substance implanted into the cells of thebrain.4- Viewing the data: Retrieved data and information are viewed through theMiraya, also called Cosmic Mirror. Some refer to it as Akashic Records.Can the Anunnaki go forward in time and meet with the future? Yes, they can! OneUlema said that future events have already happened at some level and in somespheres. It is just a matter of a waiting period for the mind to see it.Arazamir: Term. Offering; respect.

It was mentioned in the Bible bythe Prophet Ezekiel. Arwad was the headquarters of the seven wise men who camefrom Apsu, the sweet water, and attended the gods of Enki.They were known to the Sumerians as Abgal, to the Akkadians as Akkallu, and tothe Phoenicians as An-Khal. The Anunnaki called them “The Ab-n’GAL.” On theIsland of Arwad, the Phoenicians created a secret society called the “Circle ofthe Serpent” to honor their god Melkart.On Arward, the Melkart shrine/altar still stands in all its beauty and majesticarchitecture. The early learned Greeks who visited Arwad studied medicine at thePhoenician-Anunnaki medical center, and when they returned home, they adoptedthe Phoenician sign of the serpent as the logo for their healing arts. II. Arwad holds many secrets, to name a few:> • 1 -For a short time, Jesus and Mary Magdalene lived there after the Biblical> Crucifixion.> • 2- St. Paul sailed to Arwad after he has spent some time in Byblos (Jbeil)> and Batroon in Phoenicia (Today, Lebanon).> • 3 -It was at Arwad, that the Anunnaki created the “Brotherhood of the> Serpent”.> • 4 -The Phoenicians had a secret society called “The Fish” and it was> headquartered in Arwad.> • 5 -The Templars Order used the island as a hide-out.

At Arwad, the Phoenicians-Anunnaki-Ulema created a secret society:At Arwad, the Phoenicians-Anunnaki-Ulema created a secret society called“Brotherhood of the Fish”. Later on in history, the “fish” became the secretsymbol of early Christians. It was St. Paul who first created the fish symbol asa secret way for early Christians to recognize other Christians in the Levant,Greece and Rome.In ancient times, Arwad was a refuge to many persecuted Phoenicians, Hebrews, aswell as Greeks and Romans.

Meaning:1 -The eye of the house;2 -Main entrance of a home;3 -Protection of one’s home.The upper class of the Anunnaki is ruled by Baalshalimroot. His subjects arecalled “Shtaroout-Hxall Ain”, (Shtatroot Kha-Ayn” meaning the inhabitants of thehouse of knowledge, or Those who see clearly.” Their eyes are not similar tohumans’ eyes, because the Anunnaki do not have a retina. Their physical eyes areused to perceive dimensional objects. While their “inner eye” seesmulti-dimensional spheres. The process is created by the mind. The word Ain waslater adopted by the early inhabitants of the Arab Peninsula. Ain in Arabicmeans eye.The Badou Rouhal (Nomads) of the Arabs who lived in the Sahara considered the“eye” to be the most important feature of the face. Those who have practiced AsSihr (Magic) used their eyes as a psychic conduit. In their magic rituals andséances, they close their eyes and let imageries inhabit their mind. Once, thespirit called Rouh, Jinn, Afrit enters the body, the eyes open up and the visionis henceforth activated by the spirit. And what they saw next was calledRou’Yah, meaning “visions”.In the secret teachings of Sufism, visions of Al Hallaj, and of the greatestpoetess of Sufism, Rabiha’ Al Adawi Yah, known also as “Ha Chi katou Al Houbb AlIlahi” (The mistress of the divine love), and in the banned book Shams AlMaa’Ref Al Kubrah (Book of the Sun of the Great Knowledge), the word eye meantthe ultimate knowledge, or wisdom from above.“Above” clearly indicates the heavens.In the pre-Islamic era, heavens meant the spheres where the creators of theuniverse live.This sphere was shared by good gods and evil gods.The concept of hell was unknown to the pagan Badou Rouhal. Later on in history,when Islam invaded the Arab world, the eye became the symbol of Allah, the godof the Muslims. In modern times, several secret esoteric societies and culturesadopted the eye as an institutional symbol and caused it to appear on manyedifices’ pillars, bank notes, money bills (Including the US Dollar), andreligious texts. In ancient times, the Anunnaki eye was a very powerful symbol of the favoriteregional god.
