In other words, deadpeople are unreachable, once they cross the bridge of life, and enter anotherdimension that follows our third dimension, and once the 40 day period followingtheir death has expired.So, all those who claim to be able to communicate with the dead are fooling us.However, the Allamah, and some of you, who have assimilated the messages andtechniques of the Allamah --which are explained in this book in utmostsimplicity-- will be able to reach spirits and entities who did not depart yetfrom the doomed zone. They are still alive, but they do exist in a differentform. And these entities include the spirits of dead people (Human beings) whoare still trapped in the doomed zone.Some of them have stayed in this macabre and disturbing zone for hundreds,perhaps thousands of years. Other entities were never dead; they were createdfrom formulae and genetic experiments, our mind will never understand or accept.Yet, they do exist.You will be able to communicate with some of these entities, summon them, askthem favors, even command them. This first volume, and especially volume twowill show you how.But who are these entities, if they are not the souls of the departed ones, thesouls of dear friends, siblings, parents, and relatives, we once had, here, onEarth?THESE ENTITIES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OR CLASSES:1-CLASS ONE, CALLED MOO-AA-ZABEEN:Can we communicate with them?Yes, we can.Moo-Aa-Zabeen live in Marach-mawta (The doomed zone). Moo-Aa-Zabeen means thosewho are suffering.It derived from the Ulemite word “Azaab”, which means pain, suffering. Azaabexists in the Arabic language, and means the very same thing.The Moo-Aa-Zabeen suffer because their souls, or spirits (Anunnaki-Ulema use theword Mind) are trapped in the doomed zone, and can’t get out. The Sahiriin donot considered them as “Fully Dead”. Thus, we can communicate and summon some ofthem, using techniques and summons provided in volume one and volume two.Moo-Aa-Zabeen were once humans.Do not confuse “Noufous” with Moo-Aa-Zabeen.Noufous is the plural of “Nafs”, which means “Soul” of dead people. Nafs orNafsiya in Arabic. Nefesh in Hebrew.Those Noufous do not live in the doomed zone, but in the world beyond, the realmof souls (Human souls).We cannot communicate with the Noufous, and therefore, we cannot summon them.*** *** ***2-CLASS TWO, CALLED HAADEERAAT, AND SOMETIMES, ARWAAH:Can we communicate with them?Yes, we can.Haadeeraat, and Arwaah live here on Earth, as well as in multiple layers ofnon-physical dimensions, incomprehensible to many of us. Haadeeraat means“Presences”; presences of all sorts, kinds and forms of apparitions andmanifestations, such as: * Ezraelim * Gaffarim * Djinns * Afrits * Ashbah * Apkallu * Gallas * Angels * Demons * Ghoolim * Helama-GooliimArwaah is the plural of “Rouh”, which means spirit or soul. Rouh in Arabic andRoach in Hebrew. Arwaah encompasses all kinds and categories of souls andspirits we can summon. But basically, the word Arwaah refers to the souls ofangels, demons and afarit.*** *** ***LANGUAGE OF THE ARWAAH (SPIRITS)HOW DO WE TALK TO ENTITIES, SPIRITS, SOULS, PRESENCES, ETC.?They have their own language (s), and some share the same language.For reasons we do not understand, the language of the Arwaah contains manyHebrew, Kabalistic, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Arabic, Hittite, Turkish, Sumerian,Persin, Akkadian, Chaldean, and Assyrian words. Allamah Seif El Diin said, theArwaah words found in these ancient languages were originally and primordiallytaken from the Rihaniyaat, and the Ana’kh, the language of the Anunnaki andIgigi.Volume two contains sufficient number of Arwaah phrases, words, and commandswhich will help you to summon and command the Arwaah. Some entities and spiritswill only respond to particular commands, and very précised words and Talabaat.Thus, you should use the proper words and commands they understand.In this volume, and particularly in volume two, I have provided you with plentyof words and commands pertaining to a particular class of Arwaah and presences,needed in different kinds of séances. It is an absolute must to memorize thesewords and phrases.Therefore, I urgently advise you to read (And to learn) the Glossary/Terminologybefore you start reading any part of this book.*** *** ***IS THERE AN ETERNAL LIFE AFTER DEATH?Absolutely!But this after-death sort of life is incompressible to many of us. I havewritten on this subject, and describe life after death, and different dimensionsof life after death, the realm of spirits and Arwaah, and the world beyond in mybooks on the Anunnaki and Anunnaki-Ulema. I am not going to repeat myself inthis book.I advise you, if you are still interested in these subjects, to read my previousbooks. I took the liberty to list some of the most useful and informative bookson this topic, at the end of this tome.*** *** ***CAN WE BEFRIEND ARWAAH AND SPIRITS?Absolutely!The Sahiriin have provided us with a list of friendly Arwaah and spirits.They called them: * a-Moustajabiin (Those who respond) * b-Al Muhibiin (The affectionate ones)Their names are listed in this volume.And I have included phrases and commands you must use to summon them.In volume two, I added more phrases and commands needed for very specialsummoning séances, and for asking what the Sahiriin call Ahamiya Istajabaat,meaning “Big Favors”.However, you have to keep in mind, that many Arwaah are playful and tricky. Theylove to play tricks on you, and disorient you. This, happens for many reasons Ihave explained in my work. In some instances, some of these friendly Arwaah andspirits can turn on you, and possibly hurt you, if you disrespect them, and/orinfuriate them by insisting on obtaining favors that they have ignored in thepast. The Arwaah and spirits have their own reasons for not responding to thisor that Talabaat, and you must respect this. If you don’t, you could be hurt.Don’t ever think that you have a full authority and an absolute power over them.You don’t! Keep the Arwaah happy. If you do, you will befriend them for ever.And some, will stay with you for the rest of your life, to help you, to guideyou, and to grant you endless favors. * Does this mean that the spirits would help you pay your rent if you are in a financial difficulty, and find you a job if you are unemployed? * Does this mean, the spirits will come to rescue you, if you are in an eminent danger or desperately helpless?? * Can the spirits help a soccer team win the World Cup?According to the Sahiriin, they would and could!!So what we have to do to gain their full support?You will find the answer, pertinent techniques, and most secret commands involume two.ANY HOSTILE AND DANGEROUS ARWAAH AND SPIRITS OUT THERE?You bet! Plenty! And they are called Shirririin. See volume two. The Shirririinare divided into four categories: * a-Kaabihiin: It is derived from the word “Kaabeeh”, which means bad, bad deed, awful action and awful thoughts. Thus, Kaabihiin become the bad spirits. * b-Sharrariin: They are the worst. Derived from the word “Sharr”, which means evil or from the devil. Thus, Sharrariin become the evil spirits. * c-Aatiliin: They are the “Devious Spirits”, who respond only to black magic, and are usually summoned to hurt others. * d-Fasidiin: Literarily translated, the word Fasidiin means “The “Rotten Spirits” who respond to summons intended to disrupt the lives of other people, and bring them all sorts of catastrophes, including diseases, illness, and death.Note: Turkey and the Arab Peninsula Afarit are extremely disturbing. For somereasons not fully explained by the Allamah, these Afarit find a greatsatisfaction in annoying Turkish women. It looks silly to people in the WesternHemisphere, but ask those women who have felt their presence, and how they havedisrupted their lives for years, and you will hear an avalanche of incrediblestories and testimonies.No! These women are not lunatic.Many of them are highly educated and cultured, and some are universityprofessors, scientists, and even psychiatrists.*** *** ***WHERE AND HOW TO SIT DURING A SÉANCE?See: How to use this book.ANY PARTICULAR LOCAL TO SET UP THE SÉANCE?Not really.You can open and conduct your séances anywhere, as long as you are alone, andhave all the materials and accessories need to open a séance, and summonArawaah, spirits and entities.ANY PARTICULAR TIME TO SUMMON THE ENTITIES AND SPIRITS?Absolutely. There are good hours and bad hours to summon the entities. There arealso special hours to call upon the Arwaah and angels.And I have explained this, at length, and provided “Arwaah Calendars” in volumeone and volume two.SHROUDED IN SECRECY, AND AUTHENTICITY/VALIDITY OF THE MATERIALS INCLUDED IN THISBOOK.The Sahiriin Shir techniques were never recorded, and written down in asystematic manner.The techniques were never compiled and classified as a manual, but rather asDirasaat and Kiraat.They were shrouded in secrecy for centuries, for almost 1,600 years, and weretransmitted from Allamah to adepts and students. Thus, this book becomes theworld’s first work of its kind.All the techniques, instructions, Talabaat, commands, and séances summoningprotocol (s) as provided and described in this book are in conformity with theKiraat and Dirasaat of the Sahiriin, and especially their secret Ahaadeeth.I have spent more than 30 years researching and collecting Sahiriin’s materialsand work.And I was fortunate enough to study under the wings of the most honorable onesin Ethiopia, Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, the Arab Peninsula andother countries. And I have witnessed Sihr extraordinary events, andparticipated in séances out of this world; séances, my mind at the time, couldand would not understand or accept, but finally, I became a believer, because Iwas there, and I saw what has happened during the Jalasaat, Kiraat and Dirasaatwith my own eyes. The Sahiriin’s techniques WORK!*** *** ***HOW RELIABLE IS THE BOOK OF THE ARWAAH?It worked for thousands, and has been in use for centuries. It is a powerfultool! Extremely effective, if you follow the instructions of the Sahiriin. Useit for the benefit and welfare of your fellow human beings. Use it only for goodpurposes, and purify your intentions, thoughts and feelings before you summonany entity.Hurting people does not pay.Be merciful, generous and forgiving.Hate and vengeance are self-destructive.You might enjoy some success and satisfaction in hurting others, but soon orlater, your hate will destroy you.Nothing in the world is prettier and more noble than helping othersunconditionally, especially those who cannot return the favor. And keep in mind,that every time you forgive and give from your heart, you grow one inch taller,and the sky is the limit.Nothing in the whole universe substitutes for goodness, except a greatergoodness.Walk into the light, embrace this book with love, affection and humility, andspread love, generosity, forgiveness, charity, and beauty around you."},{"pageContent":"HOW TO USE THIS BOOKFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS: * 1. You must read and study both volumes, to fully benefit from the Sahiriin’s techniques, Dirasaat and Kiraat. * 2. First, you read the introduction. * 3. Second, you read the Glossary/Terminology. Later on, you revisit this section and memorize the meaning of all the words, phrases, and commands. It is an absolute must! * 4. Gather your materials and accessories, for without them, you will not be able to open and conduct your séances. They are easy to find, except for Zaafaraan, but you can substitute Zaafaraan with something else. See Zaafaraan. * 5. Keep a notebook handy. Any kind. * 6. Read this book very slowly. Do not rush. Even though, the language and style of writing used in this book are extremely simple and easy to follow, the meaning and messages of the contents require deep concentration, and in some instances, intellectual reflection. * 7. You should read each chapter several times. Read it once, and immediately re-read the chapter again. You have to anchor in your mind, what you have read. To do this, you have to read the chapter twice in each reading setting. If you don’t, you miss the whole idea! * 8. Do not ask yourself many questions while reading. Just read. * 9. Read this book with an open mind. Do not let your religious belief system interferes. In this book, there is nothing against the ethical principles of any religion. This work is not a religious one, it is rather a metaphysical, spiritual and philosophical exploration of a different world; the world of the spirits, who were created and re-transformed through a metamorphosis, incomprehensible to our mind. * 10. Your first reading should be done when you are alone. You should not be distracted by others. There are lots of words and expressions you are not familiar with. This unfamiliarity requires that you go back and forth to other sections of the book, and especially to the Glossary/Terminology chapter. Thus, you need to concentrate, take notes, memorize words, and this can not be done if you are distracted by others. Later on, it would not matter, but at the beginning, read the book alone, in a quiet place. * 11. Volume one contains the basic commands, and there are plenty of commands, Talabaat and Istijibah in the first volume. The second volume contains much more, because I have included numerous commands to be used in many and different kinds of situations and séances.If you need any help with this book, email me at delafayette6@aol.com"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1GLOSSARY/TERMINOLOGY"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1GLOSSARY/TERMINOLOGY * Aatiliin: They are the “Devious Spirits”, who respond only to black magic, and are usually summoned to hurt others. * Ahaad is Monday in the Sahiriin vocabulary. * Ahaadeeth: The secret speeches and dialogues of the Sahiriin. * Ahamiya Istajabaat means “Big Favors”, or more precisely, asking the Arwaah to grant very special favors and personal assistance for solving immediate problems, and removing obstacles. * Akbaal is Sunday in the Sahiriin vocabulary. * Al Ard: The Earth. * Al Jabaar: Mighty.

SAHIRIIN’S ALPHABET CHART (SEE PAGE).You need this chart for writing your first name in the Sahiriin’s language, onthe Burqa’h. In some séances, you will be required to write your name below themagical square, placed on the Burqa’h. Of course, you can write it in anylanguage of your choice. But the Sahiriin advise you to write your name in theirown language, simply because the Afrits, Djinns and other similar entities youwill be summoning are familiar with the Sahiriin’s language. You will get betterresults if you write down your name using letters from the Sahiriin’s alphabet.It is not so difficult to do it. It needs a simple practice. On page 54, I amproviding you with a table of their alphabet, and their corresponding letters inLatin/English.WHEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WRITE YOUR NAME IN THE SAHIRIIN LANGUAGEThere are some letters in Western languages that we can not find theircorrespondents in the Sahiriin’s alphabet. However, there are substitutes thatsound and mean exactly the same thing.For example, the letter “O” corresponds to i_Image3 [images/pic150.jpg]in theSahiriin’s alphabet, yet, it is pronounced “Waw”. But, when the name Bob iswritten with the letter i_Image3 [images/pic151.jpg], Bob in the Sahiriin’slanguage sounds exactly like Bob. Here is a demonstration:B in the Sahiriin language is: i_Image3 [images/pic153.jpg]o in the Sahiriin language does not exist phonetically, but could be written asi_Image3 [images/pic154.jpg].So, Bob in the Sahiriin’s language becomes:i_Image3 [images/pic155.jpg]*** *** ***Now, if you find out that your name cannot be written in the Sahiriin’slanguage, (because of the lack of Sahiriin’s letters that correspond to lettersin your language), don’t worry about it, you still have two options:YOUR OPTIONS:OPTION ONE:Just write your name in your native language, and add the correspondingnumerical value of each word of your name beneath it.CHART OF THE NUMERICAL VALUES OF LETTERSA: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4E: 5F: 6G: 7H: 8I: 9J: 10K: 20L: 30M: 40N: 50O: 60P: 70Q: 80R: 90S: 100T: 200U: 300V: 400W: 500X: 600Y: 700Z: 800Now, let’s find the numerical value of some names:Name: John.Numerical value of each word in John:J: 10o: 60h: 8n: 50Now, we line up these numbers under John, in this manner:John10-60-8-50Or simply, we add them up:10+60+8+50. Total: 128.And we write 128 under John, like this:John128The afrits, spirits, entities and other presences can read this.SAHIRIIN ALPHABET AND CORRESPONDING LETTERS INLATIN/ANGLO-SAXON, ENGLISH, FRENCH, ETC…Note: The Sahiriin use the Arabic (Pre-Islamic) Alphabet.i_Image3 [images/9781257174607_0054_001.jpg]HOW TO WRITE/TRANSPOSE YOUR NAME IN THE SAHIRIIN LANGUAGE:Let’s say your name is Fran.So, we have to look for “F”, “r”, “a”, “n” in the Sahiriin’s alphabet.F is: i_Image2 [images/text100.jpg]in the Sahiriin’s language.r is: i_Image3 [images/9781257174607_0055_002.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.a is: i_Image4 [images/9781257174607_0055_003.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.n is: i_Image5 [images/9781257174607_0055_004.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.*** *** ***Now you write Fran as: i_Image8 [images/text101.jpg]Let’s choose another name, Sam, for instance:S is: i_Image13 [images/9781257174607_0055_009.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.a is: i_Image14 [images/9781257174607_0055_010.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.m is: i_Image15 [images/9781257174607_0055_011.jpg]in the Sahiriin’s language.*** *** ***Now you write Sam as:i_Image18 [images/text103.jpg]Now, let’s work on Mary.M is: i_Image22 [images/9781257174607_0055_015.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.a is: i_Image23 [images/9781257174607_0055_016.jpg]in the Sahiriin’s language.r is: i_Image24 [images/9781257174607_0055_017.jpg] in the Sahiriin’s language.y is: i_Image25 [images/9781257174607_0055_018.jpg]in the Sahiriin’s language.Now you write Mary as: i_Image27 [images/text104.jpg]I am going to give you another option for writing your name on the Burqa’h.Probably, this is the easiest way.

You might need a candle holder, if you are working on a solid surface. If you are working on a sandy area, just stick the candle in the sand. * b. Size of the candle: House candle, the regular type, as long as it is not taller than 5 inches. You can always cut the length of the candle to reduce it to that length. * c.

Do not write your name on the candle. If you do, it will reverse your luck, meaning, it limits your chances and opportunities to get what you want. * k. If on the candle, you write the name of the person backward, this act will cause the person severe damages, if the entity (In this case, malevolent) grants your wishe(s). I do NOT advise you to do that. You will regret it later. Use Sihr for good purposes only, and to help your fellow human beings.

Expect to witness a most unusual magical display, because the paper is going to move in all directions, even jump. * b. Now, you are going to engage the entity in a dialogue, a sort of responses and answers in motion, meaning that the entity will answer your questions by either lifting up the paper, or shaking it one time, twice or several times, as per your request. I am going to explain this phenomenon, because I am very familiar with. I saw it several times with my own eyes. It is spectacular!! * c.

INCENSE.Burn incense before you start the séance.13. A PASSPORT SIZE PHOTO OF THE PERSON YOU ARE INQUIRING ABOUT (IF NEEDED).The spirits can tell you lots of things about people; their past, present andfuture; what they are currently doing; what are their plans, thoughts, andfeelings toward you, so on… Some evil spirits would hurt others, if the Taalebcommand them to do so. And of course, if the Taaleb’s intentions are good andpositive, the spirits will play a very effective role in helping others, andremoving burdens and obstacles in their lives. The Sihr is a powerful tool. Itis a sword with a double edge.The Sahiriin told us, that the photo of a person, and/or other personalbelongings would help too.HOW TO USE IT:FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS. * a.

Additional requirements apply, if the Taaleb is a female.See page 65.2. Burning the photo will cause severe damages to the person. But I am not goingto tell you how to proceed. Remember, hurting others is a vicious act, and inthe end, you will be hurt too.3. In some instances, when evil spirits manifest during a séance, one of themmight ask you to burn the photo. Do not fall into the entity’s trap.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3ROSTER OF SPIRITSANDENTITIES * I. Introduction * II. What is the doomed zone (Marsha)? * Khirbat-infar zone * III.

INTRODUCTION:Before you start to do anything or formulate any idea, you should keep in mindthree important things: * a-Spirits, entities, and presences have numerous names, classes and categories, such as the: * Gaffarim * Ezraelim * Ezrai-il * Afrit * Ghool * Ghoolim * Djinn “Jinn” * Gallas * So on… Each class and each category has its own pre-requisites and protocol. Don’t worry about this, for now. I will explain this, later on, in another section of the book. * b-Deceased people are sometimes called spirits; the spirits of dead people. Many mediums, channelers and psychics claim to be in touch with the spirits. Nonsense! Nobody on Earth can reach the dead, except during the 40 day period, following their death. And very few people in the entire universe can communicate with dead people, if some criteria are met, and the dead ones are still trapped in Marsha (The doomed zone). * c-Dead people are not part of the roster of spirits and entities.*** *** ***II. WHAT IS THE DOOMED ZONE (MARSHA)?The doomed zone is a dimension very close to Earth. Basically, it is a locationwhere dead people are confused and trapped in time and space, because of manyreasons, such as: * a-They died from a brutal act, which could be an accident, a murder, a homicide, a suicide, hanging, so on. * b-They do not fully realize that they are dead. * c-They are still attached to physical desires, objects, places, and people (Relatives, siblings, parents, friends) they loved so much before they passed away. * d-They are asking for justice, and in many instances, seeking revenge. So on…Thus, in their state of mind, death is something they can’t either understand orcope with. And as long as, they feel that way, they are doomed, and will remaintrapped in that dimension.They need help. Somebody here on Earth, or in that dimension must explain tothem that they are dead, and that it is time to move on.These trapped people can be contacted only during the 40 day period previouslymentioned.Nevertheless, the Sahiriin could communicate with them, even after the 40 dayperiod has expired, assuming that they have not yet left the doomed zone. Some,stay there for hundreds of years. And this is why we call their zone, the doomedzone.KHIRBAT-INFAR ZONE:Adjacent to Marsha, there is another macabre doomed zone, called Khirbat-infar,where souls and spirits of dead people were/are trapped for centuries, andremained unable to free themselves because of their deeds and actions.The Sahiriin told us that the perturbed Nafash (Soul) of many famous historicalfigures are trapped in the Khirbat-infar doomed zone.For instance, they cite:1-Philippa Al Sharrir (Philippe Le Bel), king of France who arrested andslaughtered the Templiers (Knights Templar).2-Iskandar Al Makdoni (Alexander the Great), who in their opinion was not“Great” at all, but rather a killer and a tyrant who destroyed countries,annihilated civilizations and wiped out numerous cultural heritages of theancient world.3-Karakalla (Roman Emperor Caligula).4-Bilatos Al Bounty (Pontius Pilates, the Roman prefect of Judea in Palestine,who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus Christ).5-Brutus, who in 44 B.C., on the 15th day of March, with his coconspiratorsassassinated Julius Caesar by stabbing him at least 30 times.These doomed spirits are of no help to us. And contacting them or summoning themis useless, claim the Sahiriin.*** *** ***III. ROSTER OF SPIRITS AND ENTITIES:A-70,000 ENTITIES:The book of the Sahiriin listed approximately 70,000 entities, encompassingdemons, angels, afrits, djinns, beasts, unidentified bio-organic creatures,ghoolim, ezraelim, ghouls, so on. There is no need to remember all the names ofthese entities. It would not serve any purpose. Instead, we should learn thenames of those entities, who according to the Sahiriin, were/are willing torespond to our summons and Talabaat (Requests). The Sahiriin call them theMoustajabiin.B-THE MOUSTAJABIIN:The Moustajabiin list is endless. Again, I am not going to list all of them,otherwise this book will go on and on for over.

ENTITIES FREQUENTLY SUMMONED BY THE SAHIRIIN:WHICH ENTITY SHOULD YOU SUMMON?Obviously, the Sahiriin did not summon all the 70,000 entities and spiritsliving here on Earth, in an adjacent dimension, and in different zones (Multiplelayers of existences).Thus, a limited number of entities were summoned throughout the ages. And thechoix de preference depended on the ethnic, social and religious background ofeach Saher.For example, the ancient Chaldean seers and masters of the black arts wouldsummon the high and low spirits of the Chaldean pantheon.The Akkadian and Sumerian seers and astrologers would contact the gods,goddesses, angels (Apkallu) and demons (Gallas) of the Kurnugi (Underworld), andthe Babylonian/Mesopotamian heavens.The Phoenicians had their own set of spirits, angels and demons, and theirmethod of summoning entities depended on their affiliation with a particularcult.The same thing applied to King Solomon, who was in command of thousands ofafrits and demons.SO, THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARISE:1-Which entity should you try to summon?2-Who is available?3-Which entity is the most useful for you?4-Which entities were/are frequently summoned by the Sahiriin? 5-Does myreligion affect my choice of spirits and entities?6-I am Muslim, should I try to summon spirits and entities which appeared inIslamic scriptures, in Muslim countries, and those entities who speak Arabic andare familiar with my ethnic fabric?7-I am Christian, should I try to summon the angels and good spirits who areaccredited by the Christian Church, and blessed by the Saints?7-I am an atheist, are there spirits, angels and entities who are also atheist,and who would respond to my Talabbat (Requests and desires) addressed tonon-gods and non-goddesses? And if so, should I get rid of all Talabaat thatinclude the name of God?MY ANSWER IS THIS:First, your religion has nothing to do with spirits, angels, demons, afrits andother entities, because in the world beyond, religion does not exist. Thoseentities do not follow any religion! Religion was invented by humans, andespecially by the priests of the ancient world, in order to meet and satisfytheir own needs and personal ambitions.Therefore, a Christian could summon an entity which belongs to Islamic lore andSihr, and a non Christian could summon an entity, which belongs to a paganpantheon, and/or other religious belief system.*** *** ***Second, because you are new at this, you don’t know where to start? And mostcertainly, you don’t know which entity is the most suitable, the most useful toyou, and the easiest to reach. So what are you going to do?How would you choose your spirit/entity?Well, there are no prescribed criteria and techniques to select an entity. Likeeverything in life, a quest, an effort, a result, an experience begins,continues and ends with trials and errors.We always learn from our own experience, from our successes and failures. Thesame thing applies here.THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY TO SUMMON AN ENTITY IS TO FOLLOW THIS: * 1-Look at the entire list of entities listed in this book. * 2-Randomly select one. * 3-Use the proper command for each entity. (See Vol.2) 4-Choose the correct day and hour to reach that entity. * 5-Try at least three times to summon the entity you have selected. * 6-If it is working, if the entity responds, then you are going places. * 7-Maintain a respectful and friendly rapport with your entity. * 8-At the same time, stay in charge, meaning, use Kuwa. 9-If you loose control of the séance, you will get nothing. The entity will disillusion you and send you on the wrong path. * 10-Now, you start to believe that summoning entities/spirits is a possibility. So, keep on doing this, and go ahead, and summon other entities. * 11-You can summon as many entities as you wish. But do not spend the rest of your life doing that. * 12-Three or four friendly entities is more than enough. * 13-Open your Mouzakarat, and write down everything you have encountered in your séance, and to detail the experience of your summoning. This Mouzakarat will be handy and most useful to you when you advance on the road of Sihr. * 14-If your summoning did not work, try then to summon other entities. * 15-If it is successful, limit your summoning to three entities. Do not cross this line. * 16-Do not forget to use your Mouzakarat and Kuwa.*** *** ***Third, soon or later, you would or could ask yourself these questions:I have tried three or four entities, I am pleased with the rapport I haveestablished with them, but what about other entities which could prove to bemore effective, and more useful to me?WHERE DO I FIND THEM?There are tons of spirits and entities, how to switch?And probably, one day, you would ask yourself, which are the most powerfulentities and spirits?Or, which entities are frequently summoned by the Sahiriin?This is understandable, because you want to reach those entities which haveproved themselves to the Sahiriin, and became their favorites.This, takes us to the 6 million Dollar question we have already asked: Entitiesfrequently summoned by the Sahiriin?!OK, I agree with you. So, let’s do this:TRY TO SUMMON THESE ENTITIES AND SPIRITS: * Al Asmar * Al Bahri * Bakhlahalshatoush * Burkan * Cheik Oran * El Mudhib, also called Abu Abdallah Al Said * Ghourbaan * Gibra-il * Harut Malaak * Hashtashalhakouch * Houliaj * Jahjah. * Kahyouch * Kashkash * Kattouch * Kelpirach * Lashkashilyouch * Layoush * Malik Annour * Manat * Marid. * Marut Malaak * MaymounThose entities are the most powerful, simply because they were frequentlysummoned by the Sahiriin.Did I answer your question?*** *** ***V. UNINVITED GUESTS:Sometimes, and especially during the Fatihah, an entity might ask you if he/shecould bring along another friend-spirit. Don’t. Entities are notorious forplaying tricks.Refuse their requests, especially if you are summoning bad spirits. Badencounters with uninvited spirits gave birth to what people have said, “A lesserknown evil”; “Better the devil we know”. This means, that it is better and saferto deal with a person or something you already know, or you have dealt withbefore, even if you do not like them, than to deal with a new person or newthing that could be far more threatening or even worse.And also bear in mind, that in some instances, the entity you have summonedmight shape-shift and/or project a duplicate copy of himself/herself. Thisphenomenon is called Tabadool; it has occurred in many séances, and has causedsevere injuries to the Taaleb.When the Taaleb has been physically injured by an entity, this act is calledDarb, and the injured person is called Madroub. Unfortunately, many Taalebs havelost their sight, or became permanently handicapped by uninvited bad spirits.COMMAND THE ENTITY:If your summoned spirit is insisting on bringing along his friend/herfriend-spirit, terminate the séance right away, and order the spirit to go away,using this phrase:MAAL OUN MAAL OUN, BISMA AL KHALEK WAL’ MALAKOUT AL JABAAR, IKHROUJ IKHROUJ YAFASID AL ARD. AMURUKUM AMURUKUM!!TRANSLATION: * Maal oun Maal oun: Cursed, condemned, damned. Pronounced: Maal Oon. * Bisma: By the name of. Pronounced: Bee S’mah. * Al-Khalek: The creator of the universe. Pronounced: Al Khaleck (Kha like Jose in Spanish). * wal’: And. Pronounced: Waal. * Malakout: Divine authority. The seat of the mighty Creator. Pronounced: Malaa-Koot. This word exist in Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew. * Al Jabaar: Mighty. The all-powerful. Pronounced: Al Jabaar. * Ikhrouj Ikhrouj: Get out, get out. Pronounced: Ikh (Ikh, like Jose in Spanish) Rooj (Like rouge in French). * Ya Fasid: You the rotten. You the bad! Pronounced: Yah Faa Cyd. * Al Ard: The Earth. Pronounced: Al Aard. Eretz or Heretz in Henrew. * Amurukum Amurukum!!: I am ordering you!! Pronounced: Aa moo roo koom, Aa moo roo koom.GENERAL MEANING:You bad spirit, I curse you. And by the name of the all-mighty creator of theuniverse, and the name of the holy kingdom of God (Creator), I am commanding youto get out, to get out, you the rotten spirit of Earth, I am ordering you, I amordering you!!Repeat this phrase twice and loud.*** *** ***THE GAFFARIMGaffarim: Ana’kh/Ulemite. Noun.I. DEFINITION:The Gaffarim are negative entities, reptilians, Djinns, Afrit, evil-birds, anddemons which live in the lower sphere/zone (Alternate dimension), and on Earth.The word was used in Babylonian and Akkadian mythologies and referred to demonssuch as Apep, the serpent-devil of Egypt, the Dragon of Babylon, Alu, Gallu (Thedevil spirit), Utukku, Lilu (The dreadful ghost), Ardat, and Lili.According to the book “Ilmu Al Donia”, these negative entities were created bythe Anunnaki, while they were experimenting with the early quasi-humans wholived in Brazil, Central Africa, Madagascar, Turkey, and Anatolia.II. THE MOST NOTED ONES ARE THE:a-Ezrai-ilim (Plural of Ezrai-il),b-Ubaid female-devil,c-Afrit who lived in Peri Bacalari, Cappadocia, and the underground city ofDerinkuyu, Turkey.These Afrit harass Turkish women and follow them wherever they go. Some staywith them for the rest of their lives, thus causing constant disturbances,chronic fear, and agitated state of mind.In Akkadian and Sumerian, Gaffarim were called “Galas” which means demons of theunderworld.i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0090_001.jpg]Ubaid figurine.

Some Ulema have said, that these caves wereinhabited by the Afarit, creatures and entities created by the Anunnaki.*** *** ***ANUNNAKI AND MESOPOTAMIAN/BABYLONIAN DEMONS AND REPTILIANSi_Image2 [images/9781257174607_0095_001.jpg]Anunnaki woman.See explanation on the next page.i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0096_001.jpg]This prehistoric baked-clay female figurine, from the Ubaid culture, wasnotoriously and erroneously interpreted by ufology fans, and misguided authors,as an Anunnaki reptilian woman, breast-feeding her baby.First, the Anunnaki do not feed their young in that manner. Second, the Anunnakiare not reptilians. They created us in their image. Do we look reptilians?Some Islamic scholars interpreted this figurine as one of the earliestrepresentations of the evil creatures of the Mesopotamian culture.Many names and attributes were given to these “creatures”, such as “Iblis”,“Afarit”, “Djinns”, “Ghools”, and “Chayatin”.i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0097_001.jpg]Apep, the serpent-devil of Egypt.i_Image3 [images/9781257174607_0097_002.jpg]The Dragon of Babylon.

In the Pre-Islamic era, the Arabs called them Djinns. In Islam,they are called Izrail, Ezrai-il (In a singular form). The Anunnaki-Ulema referto them as “ethereal manifestations”*** *** ***THE DJINN “JINN” IN ARABIA, ANA’KH AND UFOLOGYDjinn, “Jinn”, “Jinni”: Ana’kh/Arabic. Noun.In Ana’kh literature, Jinn means breed, race or creature. They are defined asentities created by the Anunnaki. They are also called “Afrit” by the Arabs andinhabitants of ancient Anatolia.In the Koran, Jinn is a class of beings, both male and female, between angelsand human kind, and represented as being created from smokeless fire, living inthe desert, and abandoned areas. Some live in a parallel zone, not far fromEarth.Jinns have the means to appear out of the blue, and disappear instantly, andtake on many forms and shapes, as aliens and extraterrestrials do, because theyhave the ability of shape-shifting and entering/exiting parallel dimensions.Some UFOs’ abductees have reported that the aliens who captured them looked likesmall grey creatures. Such description was not excluded in the Arabic depictionof Jinn and Afrit.In Arabic legends, Jinn and Afrit look exactly like the aliens, and theextraterrestrial “Greys”, abductees and ufologists talked about. Jinns are alsooutstanding at manipulating machines. They use them to visit far distant placesin the universe, including our Earth.And these machines have different forms, shapes, dimensions and functions. Someare oval or cylindrical, others conic and/or half-circular; similar to UFOs.*** *** ***i_Image1 [images/pic136.jpg]AN ARAB MAN ALLEGEDLY KILLED BY DJINN IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.Page that contained the Arabic article on this event, as posted on “MuslimVillage” website.

And during the night, while theysat to chat, they heard a strange voice coming from afar…from an area wherenobody lives.The voice guided them to a cave where they encountered an old and big manstanding at the entrance of the gate. They greeted him and asked him about thevoice and what he was doing here. He answered that he lived in this area for avery long time. He told them that they have heard the voice of Al Shaytan (Devilin Arabic) from the Ginn group. He warned them not to enter the cave. Theyignored his warning because they thought his old age made him believe in myth,and old fables. Anyway, they went in and one of them began to take photos of theinterior of the cave. As soon as the first flash of the camera went off, hedropped dead on the floor.The police arrived and found the man dead on the ground, his camera near hisdead body. Later on the autopsy report revealed that the man died from a heartattack caused by an accentuated trauma.And upon developing the film, the police found the photo of this gin publishedhere next to the article.”Date of the article: April 16, 2005. Source: Muslim Village.THE AFRIT OF BAALBECK:I want to share you with a great story about the afrit who lived underground inBaalbeck, because first, it is extremely unique, and second, because I was partof it, since I witnessed what the afrit have done, where they lived, and howthey reacted to commands.The story appeared in volume three of “De Lafayette Mega Encyclopedia ofAnunnaki, Ulema-Anunnaki, Their Offspring, Their Remnants And ExtraterrestrialCivilization on Earth”, which I wrote most recently, and was published in May2010.Note: In the book, I used the name of Germain Lumiere as a pseudonym, forpersonal reasonsHere is an excerpt from the book:A visit to the underground city of the Djinn and Afrit.I graduated from high school at seventeen, and was free for a while. Muchthought had to be given to the decision and preparations for my universitystudies. I expressed a desire to go to Paris for that purpose, and wasconsidering various fields, but nothing was final. I did not mind a little timeoff, though, and enjoyed my temporary idleness very much. At that time, theMaster was visiting us, and as usual, had an incredibly exciting plan for me.“Have you ever been to Baalbeck?” he asked.“No, never.”“It’s an interesting city, very old. There is a lot of controversy as to whobuilt it, though.”“Isn’t there some historical evidence?”“Plenty, but there are four interpretations.The Christian Lebanese say it was built by the Phoenicians. The Muslim Lebaneseprefer a theory claiming it was built by Djinn and Afrit. Some important occultleaders say it was built by Adam, after he was kicked out of Paradise. Well…”“And the Ulema, what do they think?” I asked, knowing that this was the theory Iwould trust.“The Ulema say it was built by the Anunnaki and the proto-Phoenicians who livedon the island of Arwad and in Tyre. There is a lot of evidence in thisdirection.”“So will I see the ancient parts?”“Of course. I would like to take you to a very special part of the city, wherethe Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to meet thousands of years ago.Unfortunately, we no longer meet there, because it became a tourist attractionand a state-controlled center of music and dance festivals. It will be fun foryou, though, to mingle with all these tourists, it’s a nice place.”“But surely that is not the reason for going,” I said.“No, it is not. I plan to take you to a secret underground city under Baalbeck,and show you where the Anunnaki landed for the first time on earth. Very fewpeople know what is going on under the modern city of Baalbeck.The first Anunnaki landing took place before the Deluge, though they came againand again after the Deluge as well.”“Before the Deluge? When was that, exactly?” I asked.“About 450,000 years ago, perhaps a bit longer. At that time, the Anunnakicreated the humans.”“And what about God?” I asked. Even though I was taught much of the Ulematraditions and world view, I never heard about the creation of the human race.“No one ever heard of God 450,000 years ago. You start to hear about God onlyaround 6,000 years ago,” said the Master. I knew enough about the Anunnaki atthat time to accept this without much trouble, so I went to find Mama and Sylvieand tell them about the upcoming trip.The trip from Damascus to Baalbeck could be accomplished in about two hours, atleast you could do that if you traveled in a decent car.We took a bit longer to get there, since the car, borrowed from a friend of theMaster who was also to drive us there, was an ancient Mercedes that did not usenormal gasoline but rather employed mazut, or diesel fuel, and made such aracket it was impossible to hear yourself think.To my surprise, I saw a mysterious Sudanese man sitting in the back seat,dressed in ill matching jacket and pants and scowling at us.At the Master’s request, he started to get out of the car to introduce himself.I watched the process in fascination, since he was not doing it quickly like anormal person, but instead was slowly extricating himself in stages, graduallydisentangling himself, like a huge snake. I have never seen such a tall man, oranyone as strange.He was about seven feet tall, very thin, and his face did not look quite humanto me, but like a giant from outer space.This bizarre apparition just stood there, looked fierce, and played with astring of amber beads. The Master ignored his uncouth behavior and introducedus.“This is Taj,” he said. “His name means ‘Crown.’ He is joining us because he hasthe key to the gate of the secret city underground. He is also able to persuadethe Djinn and the Afrit to open certain doors, which is quite a talent.” I wasnot sure if the Master was joking about the Djinn and the Afrit, so I keptquiet, nodded to the Sudanese, and got in the back seat.Taj folded himself back into the car and sat beside me, the Master went into thefront seat, and the driver, who seemed to be normal and cheerful, greeted theMaster and me in a friendly way.The car started making a noise that was worthy of demons, but I did not carebecause I was thinking about the real devils, the Djinn and the Afrit.I leaned forward and asked the Master, “Would I be able to see the Djinn andAfrit?”“Yes, of course,” said the Master casually. “You can even try to talk to them,if you like. The underground city is actually called the City of the Djinn andthe Afrit; plenty of devils are there.” Since these devils did not seem tofrighten the Master, I assumed he knew what he was doing, and sat thinking aboutwhat my part could be in this unbelievable adventure. However, I was aware ofincreasing irritation by what Taj was doing.He constantly played with his amber beads, clicking away on and on. I asked,“Why do you have to click these things all the time?”Taj seemed annoyed by my question. “Try them yourself,” he said curtly, andhanded them to me.I grabbed at them, and instantly, a horrible electric shock went through myentire body, quite painfully, and I cried out and threw the beads on the floorof the car. The Master screamed at Taj, “How dare you? How many times did I tellyou never to do that? Give me the beads immediately!”Taj handed him the beads, meekly enough, and had the grace to look embarrassed.The Master rubbed the beads, seemingly absorbing and removing the energy, andthen returned them to me. “You can try them now,” he said. “And don’t give themback to Taj until I tell you to.” Taj said nothing. He seemed unhappy in thecar, constantly fidgeting, and could not sit still. Perhaps he wasclaustrophobic, I thought, and the confined space bothered him. We drove on.Finally we arrived in Baalbeck. “Where now?” said the driver.“We are going to the Athar, the ruins,” said the Master.“I don’t know how to get there,” said the driver. “Shall I ask for directions?”He parked the car. There were many people around, some Arabs in traditionalgarb, some Europeans in every kind of attire and carrying backpacks and cameras.It seemed to be such a normal, cheerful place. I thought of the festivals andthe music; how could there be Afrit and Djinn and all sorts of undergroundlabyrinths in a place like that? It was as modern as can be.“When you are with Taj, you do not ask for directions,” said the Sudanese with asuperior air. The driver shrugged, not quite convinced.Taj winked at me and stared at the driver’s neck, concentrating. The driversuddenly started to beat his own neck, complaining how much he hated mosquitoes.I was certain there were no mosquitoes in the car, and I was sure that Tajcreated the imaginary insects that were tormenting the driver.The driver’s neck became really red.“Taj, stop this nonsense immediately!” said the Master severely. Apparently, Tajcould send certain energy rays that had the capacity of annoying people. Tajstopped, gave the driver the necessary directions, and we went to the Athar.“First, let’s go to the world biggest stone,” said Taj. We drove further, and aswe turned a road toward the Temple of Jupiter, I was shocked by the sight thatmet my eyes. It was a huge gray slab, partially buried in the sand, perfectlycut and smooth.It was unquestionably man made, not a natural formation, a short distance fromthe Temple. How in the world could such a stone get there?Who could have carried it?This stone was so immense that the stones of the Egyptian pyramids would beinfinitely small, completely dwarfed, if put next to it.The Stonehenge monoliths would be insignificant if they were placed next to it.In addition, it was immensely old, and even modern equipment could hardly copewith such a giant, let alone ancient technology.“How big is this stone?” I asked, truly awed by the sight.“Seventeen hundred tons,” said the Master.“It is hand made, isn’t it?” I said. “It is too straight to be natural. Itsimply can’t be natural. And yet, how could it get here, if it is artificial? Itjust can’t!”Taj grinned and said, “Hand made, yes, but not by human hands.”I was beginning to get the idea. “Then who made it?” I asked.“It was part of the landing area used by the Anunnaki,” said the Master. “Thereare six stones like it. Only the Anunnaki could move such a slab.”“Ah, but I can make it fly,” boasted Taj.“You must be crazy,” I said, disgusted with him.“You want to see?” He said.“Sure,” I said. “I would like to see you do that.”“Very well, but not when so many people are around. We will be back around nineo’clock, no one is around, I will show you.”Since it was around four o’clock in the afternoon, I was wondering how we wouldspend the time, but the Master had his own plan.“We have plenty of time to do what needs to be done,” he said. “I would like youto meet Cheik Al Huseini.” This was the first time I met the great man, wholater contributed greatly to my studies.We went back into the car, and drove to the Cheik’s house. The house was smalland modest, built sturdily of stone, with thick walls. The door was low, as wasnormal for middle class Arab houses. This style was followed for many years, forthe sake of safety and security.Apparently, the conquering Ottomans used to sweep into houses that had largeentrances while riding on their horses, and thus be able to kill and destroyanyone and everything inside.The low entrances forced the rider to get off his horse first, making him muchless dangerous to the inhabitants.In the big living room, which they called the Dar, many sofas were placedagainst the walls, arranged next to each other. About twenty to thirty men werepresent, dressed in Arab robes and turbans. All were elderly, with long whitebeards. The Cheik was sitting in the place of honor.When the Master arrived, everyone stood up, repeating the word “oustaz, oustaz,”to each other, meaning “teacher.” Someone pointed at Taj, and said, “The Afritis already here.” I thought this description fitted Taj perfectly, but expectedhim to be angry. To my surprise, he seemed pleased by being called that name,and grinned at me like a delighted child.We sat down, and the men came to kiss the hand of the Master. The light was low,only one lamp was turned on, but I could see that one person did not get up fromhis seat. Since this was strange behavior, I looked at him carefully, and to myamazement recognized the old Tuareg, whom I had met years ago in the suk inDamascus, the man who was cut in half.He recognized me as well, smiled, and motioned to me to come and sit by him. Icame, and he said jokingly, “Don’t start searching for the rest of my body…”I laughed, a little guilty, because that was exactly what I was planning to do.At any rate I could see nothing, since the long robe he wore covered everything.Everyone conversed in Arabic, which by now I spoke very well, and after a whilethe Cheik motioned most people out. Eight of us remained in the room.The Master, Taj, and myself, were the only outsiders.The Cheik, the Tuareg, and three other elderly Arabs completed the number of thepeople who were permitted to attend.At that moment, a man came from an inside room, carrying a big copper pot, fullof steaming hot water.He put the pot on a table in front of the Cheik, addressing him by the titleMawlana.This title meant “you are a ruler over me,” and was used only to address kings,sultans, or prophets. I was surprised. This title belonged to very importantpeople, but the house and everything in it spoke of middle class. So what couldthis mean? The Cheik must have been a very important person, somehow. I plannedto ask the Master about it later, not wishing to disturb him with questions atthe moment, since I was sure strange things were about to begin to occur.I was sitting near enough to the Cheik to see everything very clearly, andwaited breathlessly for the events that were to come. The Cheik took threepieces of blank paper, and threw them into the hot water in the coppercontainer.The room was completely silent, no one moved, except Taj, who whispered to me,“You are going to like what you see, it’s fun, but don’t move no matter whathappens.” I nodded, and concentrated on the pot, looking occasionally at Taj forclarification.Somehow he assumed the role of my guide to the occult world, and I realized heknew exactly what was taking place. “Shush, just look at the container,something is about to happen,” he said. I went on staring at the pot.Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, the water in the container disappeared, and thethree pieces of paper burst out of the container. They lined up in the air,without any support, one after the other. They waved about for a few seconds,then merged and became one larger piece.The piece of paper started swirling in the air, rotating around itself, quickerand quicker, and suddenly stopped in mid motion. It was suspended in the air,completely still, and in a flash, letters appeared on it, printed clear, black,and easily visible from where I was sitting, though I could not make out thewords.The Cheik got up, approached the paper, read the words, and then asked one ofthe people attending to close the shutters on all the windows. The room becamevery dark, and the words, seemingly separated from the paper, glowed in air likea bright hologram.The Cheik called Taj, and asked him to read the words. I could not hear whatthey said to each other, but they seemed to agree on something, as they stoodthere, nodding their heads.Then Taj came back to me.I asked him, “What was that?” He stepped on my foot to quiet me. His largefoot’s imprint was painful, so I shut up. Everyone else seemed to accept thephenomenon without trouble, and gazed at the Cheik as he began to move in astrange manner.He looked to the left, mumbling something incoherent, then to the right, sayingthe same incomprehensible things, repeating the sequence twice.Then he lifted his hands as if in prayer, in the manner shared by both Jews andMuslims. Touching his chest and pushing his hands in front of him, he said,“Ahlan, ahalan, ahlan, ahalan, bee salamah.”The letters were still glowing in front of him in the air, and he added, “Asma’oo hoosmah ath sab’ha.”I turned and pinched Taj, whispering feverishly, “Explain!”“Don’t you know anything?” said Taj. “These are the names of seven Afrits. Theyare going to open the gate of the underworld for us.”“But…” He stomped on my foot again to shut me up, and it really hurt and I keptquiet.The Cheik said, rather loudly: “Bakhooor, bakhooor!” A man appeared out ofnowhere and brought an incense holder. The Cheik moved it back and forth, theroom filled with smoke, and everyone started to chant and mumble very loudly.I understood nothing at all of what they said. It seemed they were speaking intongues, and the effect was frightening. They went on for a couple of minutes,then stopped abruptly. At that instant, the letters pulled together, became oneshining ball of light of intense silver color, and zoomed out of the room intothin air.One of the people opened the shutters and the late afternoon light streamed in.The Cheik put his right hand on his heart and said “Thank you” three times.I was wondering who exactly he was thanking, and who, originally, was he prayingfor, since he never used the words God, Allah, or any other recognizable deityname. I did not realize at the time that the Ulema, even when they were Arabs,where not Muslims, and had their own, very different, world view.The Master got up. Everyone rose with him, their robes swishing and making afaint sound in the quiet room. The Tuareg floated in the air. I looked at him,doing my best to control my discomfort. His upper body was solid, but the bottomhalf of the robe was obviously empty as it swirled around him, making theabsence of his lower body extremely and disturbingly clear. He seemed like anapparition, a ghost.Everyone came to the Master, bowed to him, and then grabbed his hand with bothof theirs, in a way that was clearly ceremonial.The right hand’s thumb was hitting the spot between the thumb and first fingerof the left hand, and then the left hand covered the right hand.The Tuareg floated near the master and did the same thing. Everyone looked ateach other and thanked each other a few times, following their thanks with thewords “Rama Ahaab.” I did not know this word, and was not aware that they werespeaking Ana’kh, the language that was shared by the Anunnaki and the Ulema.And yet I sensed that there was something very special about the way they spoke,as if by instinct. I was staring at the people and trying to understand theirwords until the Master tapped me on the shoulder and told me to come out.Taj left with me, and said, “You talk too much. You should be paying moreattention, such an occasion is not likely to happen again!” I shrugged, but Ihad to admit to myself that he was right, these events were probably unique.To my surprise, I was beginning to like the Sudanese, and no longer feltthreatened by his strange appearance and bizarre behavior.“Won’t you tell me a bit about the Afrit?” I asked, licking my lollipop. “I amnot sure why we need to call them. Why can’t we just go into the undergroundcity? I don’t quite understand anything that is going on here.”“In your home, in France, do you have a Jaras, a bell, on your door?” he asked.“Yes, of course,” I said, surprised at the question.“Well, you see, the underground city do not have a Jaras, and it is locked. Ifyou want to come in, someone must let you in. The Afrit can help you, but youhave to call them in a special way. Otherwise, they don’t know you want them toopen the door. How would they know? They are not too clever.”“Where is the door?” I said.He pointed to the ground. “Under you, under the house, there is a door. Rightunder the Cheik’s house. A door to the Aboo, the deep abyss. It is also calledDahleeth, meaning an underground labyrinth.”“Are there other doors?”“Very likely, but I only know this one.”As if reading my mind, he put his hand in the inner pocket of his ill fittingand flashy jacket, pulled out two lollipops, and handed me one.i_Image1 [images/pic137.jpg]Hajarat Al Houblah in Baalbeck.The world’s longest, largest and heaviest carved stone. Few of those stones wereused as an Anunnaki spaceship launching pad/terminal. No technology today canlift up this stone.The Arabs believe that Hajarat Al Houblah was carved and moved by the Afrit.*** *** ***i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0114_001.jpg]Hajarat Al Houblah.An approximately 1,500 tons stone known as “Hajarat Al Houblah” was used inBaalbek’s Great Platform. According to Phoenician legend, stones like this onewere moved by the Anunnaki, using levitation, and teleportation. Others haveclaimed, that the stone was transported by the afrit using their magical power.i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0115_001.jpg]Granite gray stones like this one were used by the extraterrestrials to build alanding site for their spaceships in Phoenicia (Modern day Lebanon.) TheSahiriin claimed that The Anunnaki ordered the Afrit to move these stones.One of the people came out of the house, motioned to us to come in, and said,“We are ready.” In the house, everyone was wearing a white robe, and to mysurprise, their heads were covered with the type of head scarf Jews sometimeswore in the synagogue. To confuse the issue even further, one was holding ascroll that resembled a Torah.I felt desperate. Were they going to delay our journey again and start praying?I really wanted move on, see the Afrit, have the adventure. I was tired of thedelays. Thankfully, one of them handed me a robe and commanded me to go changemy clothes, which I did, but Taj did not change his attire.I asked him why he was not required to do so, and he explained that he was notone of the Al Moomawariin, or the enlightened ones, so he was not required towear the special outfit.This did not really clarify the matter, since I was not one of the enlightenedones either, but I decided to let it pass.Taj seemed to be right about the door being under the Cheik’s house, because westarted to descend the steps to the basement.The basement was long and narrow, and had a very high ceiling, perhaps theheight of two stories. Everything, floor, walls, ceiling, were made entirely ofgray cement. It smelled of dampness, and was very cold.We went through a one room after another, all narrow and long, eventuallyreaching a small room that had an iron gate by its far wall. The Cheik openedthe gate with a large key, and behind it was a second door, made of thick wood.A second key opened this one. Suddenly a thought struck me.Why did he need a key?Why couldn’t a man who had such supernatural powers simply command the doors toopen?Or pass through them like a ghost, for that matter.I expressed my thought to Taj. “It won’t work,” said Taj. “Yes, of course theCheik could pass through doors, but how would he take you with him?”“What do you mean?” I asked, bewildered.“You are not enlightened as yet. You cannot use supernatural means oftransportation at this stage, so if he wants you, or me, for that matter, topass through these doors, he must take you inside in a normal way. If he tried,you will just bang against the doors and hurt yourself, while he would be on theother side.” I began to see that Taj was not stupid at all. Childish, andsometimes pretending to be silly and play silly games, but deep down, he wasextremely knowledgeable.We stood together in the small room, exactly like all the other rooms in thebasement. The Cheik said, “Let the boy be the last one. He needs protection.Taj, come here.”Taj joined him at the front of the line, and we entered a long corridor. As wewere walking, the corridor began to shift its shape.I felt seasick, nauseated, my balance was lost. The floor, and walls, everythingwas moving, rolling, undulating.I did not see clearly, and wondered how long this torment would last, whensuddenly all movement stopped.I looked around and nearly jumped with terror. The simple corridor became acave!A natural cave, not a man made structure.Stone, dirt, and natural formations were all around me. It smelled damp andfilthy, water were oozing from some of the walls, and the light was dim. I didnot like the place.The Master told everyone except me to stand in a crescent shaped row, and holdhands. He ordered me to stand behind the crescent, and not to touch anyone. Iwas hurt. I felt neglected, as if I were not part of the group, until one of thepeople turned to me and said kindly, “Don’t be upset, my boy. This is for yourprotection.”So I just stood there behind the people, feeling silly in my long white robe,but not unhappy anymore.At that moment, Taj made a sweeping motion with his hands and body, and screameda few words. The horrible sound he emitted was not human. It was very likely theloudest sound I had ever heard.He continued to move his hands violently, grabbed some dirt from the ground, andthrew it up in the air. He pronounced a word that to me sounded like a name, andfollowed it by the word “Eehdar!” three times.Then he said, “Oodkhool,” three times. Immediately, a rubbery kind of form movedto the left, changed to a paste-like substance, and attached itself like glue tothe wall. The sticky, pale mess looked like ectoplasm.Taj repeated his actions a few times, manifesting a new ectoplasmicmanifestation on the wall with each call. Then, he looked at the Cheik and said,“Tamam!”The Cheik and Taj were engaged in a conversation in low voices. They seemed tobe in agreement, since the Cheik said, “Yes, go ahead.” Taj advanced toward theectoplasmic forms, put his hand in his jacket’s pocket and took something out,and gave some to each of them.At this moment, the Cheik stepped forward, ready to take over, and said“Iibriiz!” The forms burst into flame, which burned the ectoplasm and produced athick fog. From the fog appeared human forms, but there were only six of them.The Cheik said “Wawsabeh!” The Master came forward, stood by the Cheik, and theCheik repeated the word, adding, “Anna a’mooree khum!” and the seventh creaturecame.Later Taj told me that these Afrit were originally created by the Cheik for areason, as they usually are, and in the normal state of events were supposed tobecome the Cheik’s loyal servants.However, the Cheik made a mistake and did not perform the exact requirementsneeded in the procedure of the creation, and therefore he lost control over theAfrit.The result was disturbing.The seven Afrit developed independent and rather evil habits, and did not quiteobey the Cheik as they should. For some reason, the only one who could call themto appear was Taj.However, that is all he could do. Since Taj was not an Enlightened One, he couldnot control them once they came, and to a certain extent was at their mercy andhad to have an Ulema present if he were to avoid potential harm.As for another Ulema controlling them instead of Taj and the Cheik, that was notpossible. The Ulema have four categories, based on their form of existence. SomeUlema are physical and live as humans, like the Master and the Cheik. Some usedto be physical, but were no longer so.Some, like the Tuareg, straddled both forms. Others have never occupied a humanform. All four versions of the Ulema can exercise immense powers, no matter ifthey are physical or non physical, but a physical Ulema can only control nonphysical entities, such as these Afrits, if he was their creator.I shuddered as I watched the Afrit. At this point of my studies, I had my shareof supernatural incidences, but I have never been so shaken before. In the semidarkness of this miserable, damp place, the Afrits were truly terrifying.Each had a more or less human face, but in this almost normal face the eyes werenot at all normal. Instead, each Afrit had two circular orbs, with whitebackground and a black pupil that stood out as if painted. The eyes did notmove.If the Afrit wanted to look to the side, it had to move its whole head. The headwas not connected to the body. Instead, it floated in a disconcerting, eeriefashion, just above the body.When the Afrit manifest, their bodies often appear first and for a few minutesappears headless, until they choose to manifest the head.This fact, coupled by their appalling ugliness, can frighten a human being tothe point of death. There had been recorded incidents of people dying of heartattack or stroke caused by such events.I kept myself as calm as possible and continued to study the Afrit. The headswere bad enough, but the bodies were even worse.They were tinted a shadowy, ugly, dark color. The torso resembled the shape of abat. Their arms were attached to the back of the body, and the hands hadextremely long fingers. Since the Afrit don’t eat or breathe, they don’t need astomach and a diaphragm.Therefore, the body had a sort of visible cavity in the front, where theseorgans would have been. The legs were twisted, like entangled wires, which musthelp the Afrit as they jump. They rarely stay in one place for long, and keepshaking and moving and twitching.They looked back at us, their ugly faces twisted in a devilish, vicious smile.They kept chattering among themselves and pointing at us with their longfingers.But Taj told me that despite their apparent boldness, they were afraid of theEnlightened Ones. Any Afrit can see the shining auras of the Ulema, and for somereason they are terrified of these auras.The Cheik commanded the Afrit to open the door. I did not understand thelanguage he spoke, but I figured it out because he used the word “Babu,” whichis so similar to the word Ba’ab.Babu is really a door, though, while ba’ab is a gate, but the words were closeenough to make it clear to me that they were going to open the door to theunderground world.I was speechless with anticipation. Everyone stood still, looking at the farwall of the cave, so I stared at it too, not knowing what to expect.The far wall of the cave suddenly collapsed, in total silence. It felt like asilent movie, because there was no dust and no sound of falling stones duringthe procedure.The stones tumbled down quietly, one by one, disappearing altogether rather thanforming a solid pile.The wall was replaced by dark, hazy fog, that allowed us a glimpse of some faraway buildings. “Now,” said the Cheik to Taj, “Let’s follow the Afrit, but don’tlet them play tricks on you.”Taj nodded. We went through the fog, following another corridor and crossingidentical rooms that seemed to follow each other in succession, all the whileseeing the far off buildings in the distance.The Cheik started reciting something.The Afrit were jumping up and down like carousel horses, while pushing forwardwith great speed, and were already a good distance away from us, going on theirown mysterious errands.Taj said to me, “You can now move to the front, it’s safe now, the Afrit won’tpay much attention to us anymore.” I quickly moved near the Master at the headof the line, and no one took notice of what I was doing. We did not move on yet.The Cheik asked Taj to show him a piece of paper he was holding, probably a kindof a map, and asked, “Do you know which room we need?”“Yes,” said Taj. “I know exactly where it is, it’s very near us. I will go in,and if I find something, I will bring some pieces back to you so you can seethem, and then we can all go in and bring everything.” Taj left for about fiveminutes, and returned with a beautiful pearl necklace, a few diamonds, and somePhoenician coins.He told the Cheik and the Master, “We can go in now, but remember, you promisedthat all the gold belongs to Taj.”“Of course,” said the Cheik casually. “But remember,” said the Master, “We arenot just going into the treasure room. You will also take us to the other room,as you promised.”It was clear to me that the Ulema were not in the least interested in thetreasure, but there was something else in this underground cavern that meantmuch more to them than any gold or diamonds.The Ulema do not need gold. They can manufacture whatever wealth they need, andthey never manufacture or acquire more than they need. Riches are of no interestto them at all.“Certainly I will take you to the other room,” said Taj. “I know exactly whereit is.” He seemed quite pleased by the bargain.We followed Taj into a small, closed room. It had no windows but was brightlylit, allowing us to see gold, gems, diamonds, and pearls stashed in boxes, jars,or simply thrown on the floor in heaps. However, I was not very interested ingold either.What I wondered about was the source of the mysterious illumination. No windows,no lamps, no candles, but bright light in every corner of the room. What couldcause this?Suddenly I realized it had to be the same type of light that was discovered inthe Pharaonic tombs and catacombs of ancient Egypt. Originally, thearchaeologists who went there were baffled by the light in the Egyptian tunnels,until they discovered the contraption that the ancient Egyptians had created.They found conical objects that functioned like modern batteries, producinglight that was so much like normal electrical light that there was hardly adifference.The batteries had to be placed in a certain way against each other, or theywould not light, and worse, could burn the user since they packed a lot ofenergy in their structure.I suspected this had to be the same type of illumination.Taj pointed the door that would take us to the room the Master wished to visit.The Master asked him, “Do you want to come with us?”“I will follow you as soon as I am finished here,” said Taj, grinning. He pulledsome linen bags from under his jacket, and busily started filling them with thetreasure.The Master smiled indulgently at him, as if Taj was a child playing with sometoys that meant little to adults but pleased the child a great deal. He said tothe rest of us, “Well then, let’s go to the next room.”We opened the door. Inside it was pitch black, but the Master stepped in withoutthe slightest hesitation, and we followed. I envied his confidence.As far as I was concerned, how did we know an angry Afrit was not waiting forus?But since no one else showed any fear, I went with them. We could see nothing,but the Master kept talking to us and so we were able to follow him. All ofsudden, bright light filled the room.I blinked a few times, and then saw the Master standing by one of the walls,holding two conical, golden objects in each hand, positioned against each other.I was right, here were the ancient batteries.The room was empty of furniture other than a beautiful wooden table, carved intoarabesques, much like Moroccan furniture.The Master placed the batteries carefully on the table, making sure thealignment allowed them to continue to produce light. I looked around. Other thanthe batteries and the table, the only object in the room was a large Phoenicianurn, standing in one of the corners.“We are going to leave you here for a short while,” said the Master to thegroup. “The Cheik and I are going to get the materials we need for our project.”“We’ll be right back,” added the Cheik with what seemed to me rather misguidedoptimism. There were Djinn and Afrit here! Wasn’t anyone concerned about thesedevils?The Master and the Cheik walked to the end of the room, very slowly, withmeasured, matching steps, as if choreographed. Then they reached the far wall,and literally went through the wall to the other side.I was not exactly shocked, since I have seen the Master go through walls before.It is an interesting phenomenon, but not as mysterious as one might think.To put it simply, the Ulema know how to control molecules; the Master hadexplained it to me thoroughly. Everyone knows that there is plenty of emptyspace between the molecules of any matter, and the Ulema make use of that factwith a specialized procedure.As the person who wishes to cross approaches the wall, the wall graduallybecomes soft, as if its molecules fragment themselves, and the human bodysimultaneously does the same.The spaces between the molecules of both grow and readjust. The person and thewall keep their shapes for an instant, then their molecules mingle and allow thepassage.At that moment, the person passes to the other side, the molecules separate, andboth wall and person become solid and normal again.The rest of us waited for about half an hour. I was beginning to worry. TheCheik said they would be right back! Something must have prevented them fromdoing so.Perhaps the Afrit, who has by now completely disappeared, took them away,kidnapped them, led them somewhere horrible? I asked some of the other people ifthey knew what was going on, but they had no idea where the Cheik and the Masterwent.However, they did not seem worried, making it clear to me that they trustedthese two to know what to do.“Don’t worry,” one of them said to me. “They can handle a lot worse than thosestupid Afrits.”“I don’t wish to contradict, Sir,” I said, “but these Afrit seem prettydangerous to me. The way they were pointing and smiling…” The others laughed. “Ihave seen the Cheik and the Master handle much worse entities,” said the man whospoke to me, very kindly. “Remember, the Afrist are cowards. They are mortallyafraid of the auras of the Ulema.”“But I understand the Cheik needs some help because of the way he handled theircreation,” I said.“Yes, this is true,” said the man. “These Afrit did turn out a bit wild. Butwith the Master there, they will never dare to harm them.” I had to be contentwith that. So I went in search of Taj, to see how he was doing with thetreasure, perhaps help him finish filling his bags.I called him and was about to reenter the room, but I heard him scream, “Don’tcome here!” and he tumbled out of the room, bleeding, and slammed the doorbehind him. “The Afrit beat me,” he gasped. “Beat me very badly.”“But Taj, you could handle those seven Afrit so well! What happened to give thempower over you?”“Seven? Are you joking? There is a colony here, something like forty of fiftyAfrit, and they all rushed at me and would not let me take the gold.”“Is it their gold?” I asked. “What do they want it for, anyway? They don’t needmoney.”“No, it’s not their gold. It used to belong to the Phoenicians, and now itbelongs to no one in particular. But the Afrit like to play with it. They likeshining things.”“But you are holding one bag, I see.”“Yes, I managed to save one bag. They got all the others, those slimy devils.”He smiled, regaining his composure. “Never mind, though. After all, I will be avery wealthy man even with just one bag.This treasure is amazing!Anyway, we must secure the door. Hold the bag for a minute.” He pushed the bagin my hands, turned, and repeated the same words he used when he originallycalled the Afrit, and gestured in the same way.While he was doing that, I heard shrieks and screams, which he later explainedwas the way the Afrit spoke as they were chased away. “That is that,” he said,surveying the door with satisfaction. “They won’t bother us again.” He took thebag and smiled at me through the caked blood and filth on his face. “Asuccessful treasure hunt, ah, Germain? And some day I’ll come back for more.”Back in the other room, I saw, to my considerable relief, that the Cheik and theMaster have returned. The Cheik was holding a stack of forty or fifty sheetsmade of shiny plastic, or plasma, or glass, and the Master had the same sizestack, but of a different type of material, brownish yellow like corn.“What is that?” I asked Taj.“I have no idea,” said Taj. “They only told me which room I was supposed to takethem to, but they did not tell me what project they were engaged in. I must sayI have a hunch it is something terribly important.” I thought so too, since theCheik and the Master seemed to be extremely solemn, and everyone else wascompletely silent. There was a strong feeling of expectation in the room.They each put his stack on the table, the Cheik on the right, the Master on theleft, leaving a space between the stacks, and I noticed that the space matchedthe size of the stacks.The Master brought the urn from the corner to the table, and made a motion ofpouring something out of the urn into the space between the stacks.I saw nothing coming out of the jar, but I figured that it might be an invisiblesubstance.This went on for about twenty seconds, then the Master returned the urn to thecorner. The Cheik took one sheet from his stack, and put it in the space betweenthe stacks. The Master then took a sheet from his own stack, put it on theCheik’s sheet, and waited a couple of seconds.Then the Master flipped his sheet back side up, and to my absolute amazement,there was print on the sheet, strong and black, consisting of strange symbolsand letters I did not recognize.Piling the sheets on top of each other, they did the same to all of them.Surprisingly, the stack, when finished, was reduced in size to about a half ofthe original sheets, even though I could not see it reducing itself while it wasworked on. I think that the plasma sheets were absorbed into the corn-like paperas the print was produced, but I am not sure.The Cheik pulled out a silk scarf from his robe, put the stack on the scarf,rolled it, lifted the ends of the scarf and tied them together, all in aritualistic way. Then he said, “Al Hamdu” twice.They turned to go, and we left the room. The Master, throughout the entire time,paid hardly any attention to me, which bothered me a little. I felt neglected,even abandoned. He must have noticed my unhappy face, because he put his hand onmy shoulder, took me back into the room, and said, “Look!” To my amazement, theroom was entirely empty. The table and the urn had disappeared.I was confused and uncomfortable.I could not understand why all that was necessary.Why Afrit? Why those doors?Where did the table go?What was this document and why was it worth all this effort? He laughed at myquestions and said, “Look at the wall.” The light was dimming as we spoke, andfinally disappeared.It seemed this adventure was over, and I said, rebelliously, that I wish thingswere made clear to me, because otherwise, I have learned nothing.I will explain everything later, Germain. I promise”“But what about the city you said we are about to see?The city where the Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to come to?The city from before the Deluge?”“So you want to see more? This was not enough?”“Yes,” I said. “Basically, all I saw was you and the Cheik going through a walland Taj fighting with the Afrit, which I admit were scary but were not toosignificant, I believe. I did not see anything remotely connected to the ancientcity.”“Well,” he said, “in this case, turn, and walk with me. You are already walkingin this city.”I looked around, and saw nothing, but he said, “Keep walking, it will come.”I should have trusted him more fully. After all, when did he ever disappoint me?I felt remorseful as the miracle began to enfold in front of my eyes, butthankfully, he did not hold my short term rebellion against me, and went oncheerfully enough.Slowly, the ancient city started to appear like a Polaroid picture in front ofme. The colors of the city were such as I have never seen before, glowing colorsof incredible beauty.The Master explained that this was because the city was located in a space thathad the same temperature everywhere, and no pressure on any object. Unlikeearth.“What do you mean, Master, when you say ‘unlike earth’ like that? Are we not onearth?”“No, we have left earth when the Afrit opened the door and made the cave wallcollapse. We are now in another dimension,” said the Master. “Everything looks alittle different here.” The city became clearer, and I thought it looked like aholographic projection, either from the past, or from the future.The buildings, though beautiful, had a sense of alien, remote places.We were now walking in a well-illuminated street, the windows of the buildingsshining with lights as well. The air was soft and fragrant.“I see buildings and streets,” I said. “But where are the people?”“They are here, but they are invisible to you. Your eyes are not constructed tosee them, not yet,” he said.“Well, it is time to leave. Let’s go up these stairs.” We started climbing avery high, stone stairway that led from the street into a destination that wasnot quite visible.I was surprised that we were not retracing out steps into the Cheik’s house, butthe Master said there was no need for that, and that exits were available invarious locations, and not as difficult to achieve as entrances.So we climbed the stairs, and when we reached the top, I saw a huge gray wall onmy left, and noticed that the pavement turned into sand.The huge gray wall was the side of the Anunnaki stone.I understood that we exited from a hole under the big stone, were out of thestrange dimension, and back on earth.“So that is what Taj meant when he said he would make the stone fly?” I said.“Yes, a rather poetic way of describing our trip,” said the Master.“Master, I am not wearing the white robe! I am wearing the normal clothes I leftat the Cheik’s house.”“Indeed, and so is everyone else,” he said, pointing to the rest of the company,who were already standing near the giant stone, and wearing normal clothes.“So what did we come here for? Surely not just to give Taj his treasure?”“We came for the book, Germain. Everything we did was much worth it, even theencounter with the unpleasant and stupid Afrit.We have recently heard that the book was here, in this dimension, after havingsearched for it unsuccessfully for generations. And now we have recovered a copyof the most important book in the world.”“The strange book you printed from the stacks? What is it?”“It is one of the very few copies in existence of what is probably the oldestbook to have ever been written. A book the Anunnaki had valued very much. It iscalled The Book of Rama Dosh.”I didn’t know why, but a shiver went through my spine when I heard the name ofthe Ancient book; the sound of the name triggered a reaction in my mind.For a second I had a feeling of tottering on the brink of a dark, warm abyssthat contained something older than the universe, and glowed with endless stars.It passed quickly, and the Master continued.“In the future, you will have the privilege of studying it. It contains theknowledge that may, some day, save humanity from its own folly. At least I hopeso with all my heart. And now, back to Damascus! Our friendly driver is waitingfor us in the car.” -Note: This story also appeared in “On the Road to UltimateKnowledge”, a book, I co-authored Ilil Arbel.*** *** ***i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0131_001.jpg]Baalbeck, in Lebanon (Ancient Phoenicia) was one of the earliestcities/colonies of the Anunnaki on Earth.BAALBECK AND “BEIT AL JIN”:At one time, a large community of lower entities called “Beit al Jin” (House ofthe Djinns) strived underground near the ruins of the Roman temples of Baalbeck.The Beit was guarded by three principal djinns who shape-shifted constantly,during their first contact (Apparition) with human beings. According to a locallegend, some of these lower entities were the remnants of the Afarit who haveserved King Solomon.One of the entrances leading to their Beit, was situated under the massive stoneof “Hajarat Al Houblah.”Note: Beit means house in Hebrew and Arabic, Bitu and Bita in Phoenician, andseveral other ancient Middle Eastern languages.*** *** ***THE GALASSEBITTI AND AKKADIAN DEMONSGalas: Akkadian/Babylonian/Sumerian. Noun.Galas are divided into two classes: * a-Spirits beneath the angels who live on Earth; * b-Demons of the underworld.Both classes were created by the Anunnaki, and were mentioned in Babylonian,Akkadian, Chaldean and Sumerian mythologies and literature.The demons of the underworld manifest themselves by night, alter their shapes,and trap people in dark places.As written in the Akkadian/Sumerian clay tablets, Anunnaki goddess Inanna wasescorted by Gallas upon her return from the Kurnugi (The underworld). Dumuzi wascaptured by Gallas and taken to the underworld. The most notorious demons wereAlu, Lamastu, and Asakku (Asag in Sumerian), seven demons created by theAnunnaki god Anu.They are known as the Sebitti, meaning “The Seven”.The most recognizable Akkadian demons were: * Bel Uri * Bennu * Idiptu * Lamashtu * Libu * Mimma-lemnu * Miqut * Muttabriqu * Pasittu * Rabishui_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0133_001.jpg]Attack by the Gallas, the Babylonian demonic creatures.

Are they humans, or spirits? And is it true thatthey were created by the Anunnaki in ancient times, and are reproduced nowadaysby the Anunnaki-Ulema?Helama-Gooliim is the name of entities (Human-like) created by Anunnaki-Ulemafor the purpose of performing a good deed.They are part animal, part human, part Golem, part Ghoul; a hybrid race. Theyare made of clay, or earth materials, much like all of us, but they have certainphysical differences from both humans and animals. They look exactly like normalpeople; they have eyes, hands, feet, etc. “They are not at all like machines orrobots. You will not think them anything but human if you saw them…”said UlemaMordechai.They are born full adult. They are sensitive to light, so they work only bynight, but they are nevertheless great engineers. Ulema Mordechai stated thatwhen the Ulema, and some Kabbalists, reach the holy level of Kadash Daraja, theycan create life. Real life.The creatures would function much like human beings, but they have three deepfundamental differences: * 1-They don’t have a soul, * 2-They don’t have a physical heart that functions like a blood pump, * 3-They don’t have a wired brain.Their essence comes from another dimension, to which they return after theirtask is done. They are created for that task, and that is their only purpose.The creator tells them what to do, and they do it right away.In my case, I have created four of them to build houses for poor people inEstonia, and they did it very nicely, overnight.”Anunnaki-Ulema Mordechai ben Zvi created a fleet of HelamaGooliim. And here iswhat he has said to me word for word about the entities he created: “I createeach of them separately. For each, I bring with me seven pieces of papers onwhich I write certain codes, and I have to have my cane with me. Then I takesoil, earth, or clay, and pour water on it to make it pliable. Once it’s theright consistency, I mold it into a ball. I turn off most of the lights, leavinga very low illumination, maybe one candle or a small lamp, and pull back aboutfour to five feet.I then read a certain text that would encourage the ball to take the next step,which is to shape itself into an oblong of about four feet, and be ready tofollow my special design. At that point I take my cane, walk to the other sideof the oblong, dip the cane into the oblong, and stretch it.I command the oblong to duplicate a human form, and it becomes a statue,lifeless, but similar in every way to the human form. I take the seven pieces ofpaper, and put two in the eyes, two in the ears, one in the mouth, and one onthe breast, over the heart.I roll the seventh piece as if it were a homemade cigarette, go to the otherside of the statue, and throw the rolled paper at it. It always lands either inthe nose or between the feet, and either position is correct.The statue starts to move and attempts to stand up. At this time I turn aroundand leave the room for a few minutes, so as not to look at the statue as itcomes to life. Seeing the actual transformation is forbidden by the Code of theUlema, as stated in the Book of Ramadosh.I stand behind the door of the room, and wait until I hear the creature make asound, which tells me that the procedure is complete.I go back into the room, welcome the creature, give it clothes to wear, and pullout all the papers, to keep safely until such time as they are needed todisassemble the creature and send its essence back to its original dimension.I create them to do one single task.When the task is accomplished, I ask them to lie on the floor, next to eachother, return the pieces of paper with the codes to the correct places, and pourwater over their bodies.The bodies disappear, leaving earth on the floor, and the essence goes back towhere it came from.” Asking the Ulema: “Do they always go away peacefully?” hereplied: “No, sometimes they develop a personality, if the task is a bit longer,and they have the delusion of being human and want to stay in our dimension. Ofcourse it would be cruel and inhuman to let them stay, not to mention dangerous,but they do become tricky. So the Ulema or Kabbalist must be even trickier, andhypnotize the creature into deep sleep.Then I put the papers where they belong and set the paper on fire, and the bodystarts smoldering. At that time, we pour the water over them and theydisappear…they built for me nice houses…The next morning, very early, I went toinspect the houses, and removed the great blanket that covered the area. Theblanket is a large plasmic sheet that can create a shield of invisibility overthe entire area. We just refer to it as a ‘blanket’ because it’s a short andeasy name…”*** *** ***IZRAELIMIzraelim: Anunnaki/Ulemite. Noun.Entities created by Anunnaki geneticists, for the sole purpose of building hugeedifices and immense temples, such as the walls and plateau of Baalbeck, thePyramids, the fortifications of Tyre in Phoenicia, and the ramparts of theearliers cities and fortresses in Turkey, later, renovated and maintained by theHitties, the ancestors of the Turks.i_Image4 [images/pic138.jpg]A Mesopotamian/Babylonian Zigurat.According to Anunnaki-Ulema Sadik, “The early Zigurat were erected according toparticular dimensions and blue prints given by the Izraelim and Anunnaki’sremnants to the Sumerian architects and builders.”Ulema Medhat Shawkat stated that the Biblical Great Flood’s boat wasconstructed/built according to these Anunnaki’s specifications. Even theexterior (External structure) of the boat ressembled the front façade of aZigurat.”He added, “Noah’s boat was not only a boat, but a depository of genes and DNAstored by the Anunnaki, for further use in their genetic experiments.” Accordingto the book Ilmu Al Donia, and Mouzakarat Sinhar Marduchk, some of the Izraelimhad reptilian heads.*** *** ***GOLEM “GOLIM”GOLEM “GOLIM”: ANA’KH/ULEMITE/HEBREW. TERM. NOUN.Golem (In Ana’kh) is a prototype of a created presence or entity, usuallyassociated with the mixture of a terrestrial element and the thought of a Golimuwho creates a non-human creature. From Golim, derived the Kabbalistic/Hebrewword Golem.RABBI LOEB AND THE GOLEM OF PRAGUE.Of all the Golem legends, none is as famous as the story cycle of the Golem ofPrague. There had been books, plays, and even films depicting it, and often theyincluded the creator of the Golem of Prague, Rabbi Loeb.*** *** ***i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0140_001.jpg]Star of David and the Anunnaki Delta.In the 1920 German Film “Der Golem” (The Golem), the Golem is dentified with the“Star of David”; the Pentagram Star, illustrating two ascendant points ordirections referred to as negative and evil. In Medieval Christianity, theysymbolize the horns of the devil. If the sign is ascendant, then and only then,positive energy emanates from the star or the Anunnaki’s Delta.In the book of Ramadosh, the “Star” is frequently represented as “Delta”, a signof power and negative force, said Ulema Rabbi Mordechai. And he added: “Manyplaces on Earth have this negative force that runs underground. This negativeenergy causes severe damages to one’s health, and mental awareness. Many are notaware of it. It is easy to find out by using the “Triangle Technique”.Prague was home to many Jewish scholars and mystics; Rabbi Loeb was probably themost famous.He lived a long life, 1513-1609, and defended his people valiantly against theirenemies. His followers loved him so much they called him \"The Exalted One.\"Even to a holy man, or a great mystic, creating life is forbidden. It can onlybe justified if many lives would be saved by doing so, and not always even then.But Rabbi Loeb was instructed to try the horrifying task. He created his Golemwith divine help, using Kabbalistic formulas communicated to him in dreams.Acquiring this God-given knowledge was neither simple nor easy. The formulaswere given, but deciphering them had to be done by the person himself. Worse, hehad to use the Shem Hameforash -- the true name of God, which was known only toa few holy men in each generation, and was very dangerous to pronounce. Thepower it unleashed could turn against the man who uttered it.This myth is unusual in that it is supposed to have happened in a specific year-- 1580. There was a new danger brewing in Prague; a notorious priest, Taddeush,planned to accuse the Jews of a new \"ritual murder.\" Rabbi Loeb heard about it,and to avert the horrible danger, directed a dream question to heaven to helphim save his people.He received his answer in an order that is alphabetical in Hebrew: Ata Bra GolemDevuk Hakhomer VeTigzar Zedim Chevel Torfe YisroelThe simple meaning was: Make a Golem of clay and you will destroy the entireJew-baiting company. But this was only part of the message. The inner meaninghad to be understood to be effective.Rabbi Loeb extracted the real message by using Zirufim, special Kabbalisticformulas. And when he was done, he knew he could accomplish the creation of athe Golem.He called two people to assist him. His son-in-law, a Kohen (a Jew descendedfrom the ancient order of priests) and his pupil, a Levite (a Jew descended fromthe servants of the Temple). He explained that they needed four elements --fire, water, air and earth.The two assistants represented the fire and water, Rabbi Loeb, air, and theGolem, earth. He explained how they had to purify themselves, because unlessthey were completely ready, the Shem Hameforash would destroy them.i_Image3 [images/9781257174607_0142_001.jpg]The Kaballah Sign with the Anunnaki Delta (Triangle) in the center.i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0143_001.jpg]The Star of David as represented in the Chaldean Magic.After a day of purification, they read various chapters from a particularly holybook, Sefer Yezira (The Book of Creation) and then went to the River Moldau. Bytorchlight, they sculpted a giant body out of river clay. The Golem lay beforethem, facing the heaven. They placed themselves at his feet, looking at thequiet face.The Kohen walked seven times around the body, from right to left, recitingspecial Zirufim. The clay turned bright red, like fire. Then the Levite walkedanother seven times around the body, from left to right, reciting some moreZirufim. The fire-like redness disappeared, and water flowed through the body.He grew hair and nails.Then Rabbi Loeb walked once around the body, and placed a piece of parchment inhis mouth, on which was written Shem Hameforash.He bowed to the East, West, South and North, and all three of them recitedtogether: \"And He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man becamea living soul.\"i_Image1 [images/9781257174607_0144_001.jpg]The Golem in “Young Frankenstein” film.The creation of a Golem, as it appeared in Mel Brooks’ film Young Frankenstein.A scene from the film, shows actor Gene Wilder in the process of creating aGolem. Like Rabbi Loeb, Wilder is trying to conjure the Golem and to order himto return him to life.The Golem opened his eyes and looked at his creator. They dressed him and tookhim to the synagogue, where he could get ready to start his mission.Eventually, when the Golem was no longer necessary (and some claim he went madand became a danger to everyone) Rabbi Loeb decided to return him to the voidfrom which he came. He did that by recalling the Shem Hameforash, and with itthe life principle, and thus restored the Golem into lifeless clay.The clay figure had to be hidden in the attic of the synagogue, and no one waspermitted to enter it again until many years later. Some writers during thenineteenth century claimed that the outlines of a giant body could still be seenthere. –From the Book “Anunnaki, Ascended Masters, Ulema and Fallen Ange’s”,co-authored by M. de Lafayette and I.

Also, the tablets depicted the creation process, and the words(Or Command) the Anunnaki gods and goddesses used to bring life to their “ClayBeings”. In Ethiopia, Latvia, and Hungary, Anunnaki-Ulema have created severaltypes of Golem Mordachai ben Zvi (My teacher and mentor in Budapest) describedin-depth how he created two types of Golem, and ordered them to build a smalltown in Latvia, to shelter refugees.

Noun.In Ulemite literature, the Ghool are two categories of species that belong to alower entities sphere. In other words, the Ghool are entities created by theAnunnaki at the time they experimented with the primordial prototypes of humans(Quasi-humans).These creatures looked half animal-half human, with “deformed”physical-bio-organic shapes and structures. Some classify them with the Bahomthor the early Bahama (Baha’eim).CHIRIBUChiribu “Kirubu”: Anunnaki/Ulemite/Assyrian. Noun.Kirubu is the Assyrian name for the Guardian Angel, usually depicted as a wingedbull with a man’s face. The Kirubu was in charge of protecting and guarding themain gate of the Assyrian palaces.The word Cherub derived from the Ana’kh (Anunnaki language) word Chiribu“Kiribu”, which is an attribute to an Anunnaki personage who materializes anddematerializes at will.Later on in history, all the Near Eastern, Middle Eastern, Judaism, Christianityand Islam will incorporate the name and its characteristics in their religion.But the original Angel/Cherub is an Anunnaki personage!The word Cherub (Cherubim is the Hebrew masculine plural) is a word borrowedfrom the Assyrian Kirubu, from Karâbu, which means \"to be near\", and Karâbuderived from the Anunnaki word Chiribu.i_Image2 [images/9781257174607_0152_001.jpg]Winged Genii/Kirubu Angels.i_Image3 [images/9781257174607_0152_002.jpg]Chiribu “Kiribu” kneeling beside a sacred tree.

Anunnaki-Ulema have stated that some of the Afritwere created by the Anunnaki. They are mysterious entities or presence (Physicaland nonphysical beings) with extraordinary powers who manifest themselves tohelp those who know how to call upon them. They are the genetic creation of theAnunnaki who later on in Middle Eastern folklore and Islamic scriptures (Arabicand Persian) became the Arabian Afarit, or Ifrit known as evil spirits.*** *** ***II. LIST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AFRIT:The Sahiriin in the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab Peninsula have a listof the most important afrits (Afarit).The list included 300 entities, and the most powerful ones are: * Abu Mihriz, also called Abu Yahkoob, and he rules over Tuesday; * Barqan Abu Adjayb; he rules over Wednesday; * El Mudhib, also called Abu Abdallah Al Said; he rules over Sunday; * Murrah El-Abiad Abu El-Hareth, also called Abu Al Nour; he rules over Monday; * Shamhurish El Tayyar; he rules over Thursday.i_Image6 [images/9781257174607_0158_001.jpg]A medieval illustration of King Solomon and the Afrit, who wereplaced under his command. The Afrit were originally created by theAnunnaki.IV. LIST OF THE FRIENDLIEST AFRIT:They are called Al Muhibiin by the Sahiriin.Friendliest afrit means afrit who are known to be benevolent, and sometimesquite entertaining. They are not necessarily the most helpful ones, but surelythe most pleasant.Why?Well, afrits are notorious for playing tricks on people, and some are extremelydangerous, because they can injure the Taleeb, and cause permanent damages.You will never know when they will hit you, or throw at you objects they appearfrom nowhere. You have to remember that even though, they manifest themselves toyou on a physical plane, they are still linked to the invisible Wasla.So, not all afrits and entities are friendly.Some are very hostile, and they try to control you and scare you during theséance.You better be prepared, and defend yourself by pronouncing the proper command tosend them away. You will find the command in another section of this book.Why do we call them friendly?The Sahiriin have told us that Al Mubibiin have helped so many people in theirmoment of difficulty.Not only have they comforted the needy and the weak, but also managed to teachthem how to solve their immediate problems. Allamah Bader El-Dinn said, “Thefriendly afrits have revealed to us, some of the greatest secrets and mysteriesin the world, and taught the righteous ones, techniques that have transformedtheir miserable and unhappy lives into successful and very joyful lives.Techniques like Gumaridu, Gubara-ari, and Da-irat.And because they are so friendly, Al Muhibiin quite often extend an invitationto visit their fantastic world. A place of beauty and splendors.”Note: The Gumaridu, Gubara-ari, and Da-irat techniques are fully explained anddetailed step-by-step in my book “The Book of Ramadosh. 7,00 Year OldAnunnaki-Ulema Techniques to Live Longer, Happier, Healthier, Wealthier.”THE MOST NOTED OF THE AL MUHIBIIN ARE: * Al Hanun. Meaning: The affectionate. Pronounced: Al Ha noon. * Al Muhib: Meaning: The loving one. Pronounced: Al Moo Hib. * Kamar Selwan Badri: Meaning: The comforting early moon Pronounced: Ka mar Sell whaan Ba dree. * Sharif Al waj’ha. Meaning: The noble face. * Pronounced: Sha reef Al waj Haa. * Cheik Al Nei’maat. Meaning: The master of blessings and graces.

The magical square for FridayYour Sihr work on SaturdaySummaryLike humans, different categories of entities and “presences” have their ownRizmanah (calendar). * Entities means: Spirits, Ghools, Djinns, Afrits, Arwah, Demons, Angels, Ghosts, and similar manifestations. * Presences mean the manifestation of non-physical elementals and entities that live on Earth and other dimensions. * Rizmanah (Calendar) means a week or the days of the week of the entities and presences. * Good days means, that on these days, angels and benevolent spirits and entities can be summoned. Many of them appear in the flesh. Others communicate with us using different means such as the “Triangular Papers”, and projection of objects. * Bad days means, that on these days, evil and malevolent spirits and entities can be summoned.*** *** ***I. THE RIZMANAH: CALENDAR OF THE SPIRITS ANDENTITIESThe Rizmanah of the entities consists of the following days:MONDAY:Monday is called Ithina in the Sahiriin vocabulary. Later on, it was changed toAhaad, for reasons we do not know. It is a bad day.Bad day means that on this day, only bad entities or presences manifestthemselves during a Mindkhal (Séance). On Ahaad, the Saher (Magician) or theKare’h (Reader; you) can communicate with malevolent spirits.TUESDAY:Tuesday is called Taltah in the Sahiriin vocabulary. It is a good day.Good day means that benevolent entities or presences manifest themselves duringa Mindkhal (Séance). Taltah is abundant with apparitions and manifestations,meaning that on this day, spirits and entities are easily reachable, and/orwilling to respond to your summons and Talabaat (Commands and wishes).If the spirits respond, then the Kareh (Reader, you) becomes a Taaleb.Taaleb means a person who is summoning spirits and entities.WEDNESDAY:Wednesday is called Arba’ah in the Sahiriin vocabulary. It is a good day.THURSDAY:Thursday is called Khmasi in the Sahiriin vocabulary.It is a good day.FRIDAY:Friday is called Ijmah in the Sahiriin vocabulary. It is a good day to summonthe spirits and entities. Only benevolent presences manifest themselves onFriday.SATURDAY:Saturday is called Sabith in the Sahiriin vocabulary. Saturday can be used tosummon both the good and bad spirits.SUNDAY:Sunday is called Akbaal in the Sahiriin vocabulary.It is the Rihah day, meaning the day of rest of the spirits and entities. Noextensive Sihr work, or prolonged séances should be done on this day. However,you can still summon the spirits and entities for a very short time.Short time means a maximum of twenty minutes.Note: More explanation is provided in volume two.*** *** ***II. CHART/SQUARE OF THE SPIRITS AND ENTITIES CALENDAR OF DAYS AND CORRESPONDINGLETTERS:i_Image2 [images/picture101.jpg]YOUR SIHR WORK ON SUNDAYSUMMARY:Sunday is the day of rest of the spirits and entities. Therefore, the Taalebshould not conduct long séances. No extensive Sihr work, or prolonged summoningséances should be done on this day. However, you can still summon the spiritsand entities for a very short time.For Sunday, only Mouraba 1 should be used (See below). On the following pages, Iam reproducing Mouraba 1, because you must copy Mouraba 1 and place it on theBurqa’h.THE MAGIC SQUARE OF SUNDAYi_Image6 [images/picture100.jpg]MOURABA 1CALENDAR/SQUARE OF SUNDAY AND CORRESPONDING LETTERS.*** *** ***NOTE (LINGUISTIC AND PHONETIC):The square starts from right to left with the letter i_Image3[images/text20.jpg]F.The square ends with the letter i_Image4 [images/text21.jpg]‘Kheh.F is pronounced Fa.Fa or F corresponds to Eastern and Western names like Fayrooz, Feyrooz, Farid,Philip, Farah, Frank, Fifi, Fatima, Philomena, Francis, Fernando, etc. In otherwords, the F or Fa sounds like F and Ph in Anglo Saxon and other Westernlanguages.The Anunnaki-Ulema called “F” the forbidden letter, or more precisely, theletter that was never allowed to be included in the Phoenician Aramaic, andHebrew alphabets.“Thus all secret sounds and meanings associated with F would not be pronouncedor heard, or known to the un-enlightened ones…” said Ulema Hanafi.“There are 12 secret words starting with the letter F that are hidden in theTorah, and the Book of Rama-Dosh…” explained Ulema Sadiq Al Qaqsi.And accordingly, each word produces a powerful sound capable of changing thefabric of time.The letter F was substituted by Ph, pronounced Pveh in several Semiticlanguages, except Arabic; the proto-Semitic “P” became the Arabic “F”.*** *** ***Cut this page, or copy Mouraba 1 (Square below) and place it onthe Burqa’h. This is the only magical square you should use onSunday. Informations on how to use the magical square areprovided on the next page.i_Image2 [images/picture102.jpg]FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:BEFORE YOU SUMMON THE ENTITY:PREPARATION: * 1. Make sure you are alone. * 2. Wear white clothes. * 3. Light up one white candle and place it on the right side of the Burqa’h. Never, ever on the left side, because it is considered by the Sahiriin as the “Side of the Devil”, or the malevolent entity. * 4. Place a glass of water inside the Burqa’h (On the left side). * 5. Throw a little bit of salt around the Burqa’h. (On the outside) * 6. Copy Mouraba 1, and place it in the middle (Center) the Burqa’h.The Burqa’h is the area or place you designate on the floor as your Talabaat andSummoning zone.This is your anchored center where you will place all the magical squares, themagical circles, your written requests, the letters, words and phrases ofcommand, as well as photos and personal effects belonging to others, if you wantto link them to your Sihr readings, and make them a vital part of your searchabout everything you want to know about them.DIMENSIONS OF THE BURQA’H:10 inches by 10 inches, if you choose a square, or 12 inches diameter if youchoose a circle. Both serve the same purpose.So don’t worry about it. Use whatever is available to you. A circle is fine, anda square is equally fine.So, you have to draw either a circle or a square on the floor. Use any kind ofpen or pencil. You can also draw the square or circle using a stick or yourfinger, if you are in a sandy area. Sand is very fine too. * 7. While you are drawing the circle or the square, repeat this phrase (Command) twice:THE COMMAND:MARSIH KIDRAASAYED ARWAH AJEEBOO TALABAATIAA MOO ROO KOOMAA MOO ROO KOOM.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Marsih: Marsih (Name of a powerful enity). * Kidraa: Capability. Power. Authority. * Sayed: Master. * Arwah: Spirits. * Ajeeboo: Respond. Answer. * Talabaati: My requests. My wishes. * Aa moo roo koom: I am ordering you (I am commanding you).GENERAL MEANING:Powerful Marsih, Master of spirits, answer my requests. I am ordering you, I amordering you.You have to memorize this phrase.Do not copy it and try to read it afterward. You must memorize this phrase!! * 8. Place Mouraba 1 inside the square or the circle, like this:This area here (Square) is the Burqa’h.i_Image4 [images/picture103.jpg] * 9. Write down your first name under the Mouraba like this, see below:i_Image2 [images/picture104.jpg]Your name here, for exampleFRED, FRANCIS, or FARAH * 10. Write down (Briefly) your wishes or requests, under your name, like this:i_Image2 [images/picture105.jpg]FRED, FRANCIS, or FARAHWrite here your wish or request. For example, you couldwrite:I want to know if I am going to be hired for the job I haveapplied to on Wednesday.OrIs he cheating on me, and if yes, give me her name.*** *** ***IMPORTANT NOTE:The entity will respond!! And you will get the correct answer, assuming you areusing the proper command. Some Sahiriin do not write down their wishes. Instead,they converse with the entities.You can do this too, but if you are a beginner, it is advisable that you placeyour request or order in writing. As you progress, you will understand why?For your first séance, do not ask many questions.Three or four questions is more than enough.Why?Because you have not yet established your authority over the entity!*** *** ***You are on your way now to summon the entity!THE SUMMONING SÉANCE:FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:1. THE COMMAND:FIRST THING YOU MUST DO IS TO PRONOUNCE THIS COMMAND:IHDAROO IHDAROO AYATOUHA AL ARWAH AL KAREEMA. AHLAN WA SAHLAN. BISMOU AL KHADERSAYED AL DOUNIA AAMOO ROOKOOM AMOO ROOKOOM.RAB AL ALAMEEN, ALLAHOOMA SAKHER LEE AL ARWAAH AL KARIMAH WA AL AFRIT ALMAYMOUN.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Ihdaroo Ihdaroo: Make appearance make appearance. Manifest manifest. * Ayatouha: Oh You! * Al: The. * Arwah: Spirits. * Al: The. * Kareema: Noble. Generous. * Ahlan: Welcome. * wa: And. * Sahlan: Usually spoken and written as Ahlan wa Sahlan to complete the whole sentence which means you are welcome in our place or home. * Bismou: By the name of. * Al: The. * Khader: Khader. It means the capable. Name of a spirit. * Sayed: The master. * Al: The. * Dounia: The world. * Aamoo rookoom Amoo rookoom: I am ordering you I am ordering you (Commanding you). * Rab: God. * Al: The. * Alameen: The worlds; this one and the other. * Allahooma: Oh my God. * Sakher: Dispose.

Name of a spirit.GENERAL MEANING:Come in, come in, You the Honorable (Noble) spirits. You are welcome (I welcomeyou). By the name of Alkader, the Master of the world, I order (Command) you, Iorder you. Oh God of the universe (All worlds) put at my disposal the NobleSpirits and Al Maay Moon the afrit. * 2. You wait 10 seconds or so, to see what is going to happen.Usually, nothing does, if you are new at this. Then, you try one more time.Meaning, you repeat one more time the same command. And once again, you wait for10 more seconds.This time it should work. If not. Do not give up. Try again for the third time,and wait for 10 seconds or so.If despite all your efforts, you remain in vain, try to summon another spirit.For example, you can call upon one of the Moustajabiin, or Al Muhibiin.It is crucial that you don’t give up or loose faith.Summoning requires patience, trust, determination, and above all establishing afriendly rapport with the entity.You might ask, how I am going to establish a friendly rapport with the spirits,if they are not hearing me. How can I do that if they are not here?You are wrong! The entity is here! Right in front you, but you cannot seeit/him/her yet! The entity is checking you out.The entity is sizing you up! Yes sir! Sometimes, the entity wants to play withyou, and very possibly, tease you or even play tricks on you. Remain calm.Welcome the entity one more time by saying:AHLAN WA SAHLAN. HOUDOURAKUM KARIM.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Wa: And. * Sahlan: Usually spoken and written as Ahlan wa Sahlan to complete the whole sentence which means you are welcome in our place or home. * Houdourakum: Your presence. * Karim: Noble.GENERAL MEANING:You are so welcome. I honor our presence.If this welcome did not work, close the séance, and try again the following day.If the entity finally manifests in the flesh, then proceed to converse with theentity.*** *** ***2. CONVERSING WITH THE ENTITY:Now you are entering an un-chartered territory; a world you have never believedexisted.You will be terrified for a while, yet pleasantly surprised to see the entitystanding before you. And you will be confused as well, because the entity seemsto have no gender.Sometimes, the entity is a male, or at least, it appears to be an older manand/or a young boy. Some other times, the entity is a woman. And in some cases,the entity is both. How could this be possible?SHAPE-SHIFTING OF THE ENTITY:Well, according to the Sahiriin, the entity is capable of shape-shifting. Thismeans that the entity is capable of materializing in any shape or form. And insome rare instances, the entity appears shapeless, or incomplete.This is going to scare you at first, but as you progress on the road of Shir,shape-shifting and similar extraordinary phenomena become very ordinaryhappenings, and your mind will self adapt to Sihr incomprehensiblemetamorphosis.*** *** ***YOUR SIHR WORK ON MONDAYSUMMARY:Monday is a bad day for summoning spirits and entities.On Monday, only bad entities or presences manifest themselves during a Mindkhal(Séance).On this day, only communications with malevolent spirits occur. If you are abeginner, do not attempt to set up a séance on Monday. You could be hurt.Malevolent and vicious entities are known to attack the Taaleb on Monday. Andsince you do not know all the proper commands to send away the bad entities, youwill not be able to control them and/or to command them.The Sahiriin called Monday “Baab Al Shayatiin”, meaning the door of the Devils(Yes, in plural). * Baab means: Door. * Al means: The * Shayatiin means: Devils.Many Sahiriin who have lost their ethical principles, frequently use Monday tosummon the evil spirits, for one purpose: Destroying their enemies, and causingcatastrophic results to people they have linked to their summons. Sorry, I amnot going to tell you anything about summoning spirits on Monday.*** *** ***i_Image1 [images/picture106.jpg]THE MAGIC SQUARE OF MONDAYMOURABA 2Calendar/Square of Monday and Corresponding Letters.YOUR SIHR WORK ON TUESDAYSUMMARY:Tuesday is a good day for summoning entities and spirits.Tuesday is abundant with apparitions and manifestations of benevolent spiritsand entities. According to the Sahiriin, angels manifest themselves in the fleshon Tuesday.ROSTER OF ANGELS YOU CAN SUMMON: * Seraph-iil, called the affectionate. * Gibra-iil, called the just. * Mikha-iil, called the merciful. * Isra-phiil, called the great and dear one. * Izra-iil, called the all mighty. * Natana-iil, called the watcher. * Rehma-ill, called the grantor of favors. * Nisra-iil, called the victorious. * Repha-ill, called the loving companion. * Mounawar, called the spirit of light and truth.*** *** ***THE ISTIJABAH:Each angel has his/her own Istijabah. There is a major difference between aCommand and an Istijabah. Commands are used to command and order spirits andentities. Istijabah is a request, NOT a command, simply because you cannotcommand angels and order them to do what you want. They belong to Shoula AlNour; the sphere of light, love and ultimate wisdom.The angels are far more superior than any other spirit, human, and/or a livingcreature. They are more powerful, affectionate, and of course wiser than all thespirits. Their power is the power of love, mercy and unconditional assistance.The angels will help everybody and anybody.You have to address the angels very properly, and show a great respect.There are several kinds of Istijabah. Each angel responds to a very particularIstijabah (See Volume 2). However, all Istijabah must appear on the Burqa’hunder the Daa-ira Ilahiya. (See next page)Below the Istijabah, you place Mouraba 3.i_Image5 [images/picture107.jpg]MOURABA 3THE MAGICAL SQUARE FOR TUESDAY.The Mouraba 3 starts with the letteri_Image1 [images/picture108.jpg].It is pronounced: Sheen.It is a deterrent againt evil, against vicious thoughts, against bad intentions,and above all against Shaytan (The Devil).The letter i_Image5 [images/picture110.jpg]is the first letter of the wordSharr, which means evil deed. The reason for opening Mouraba 3 with this letteris to stop evil things, and prevent mishaps and catastrophes. The angels arefamiliar with this letter. As soon as they see it, they will know that dangermust be eliminated, and evil things that may occur in your life must be removedright away. They have the power to do so.*** *** ***HOW TO USE IT:FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS. * 1. Place Daa-ira Ilahiya on the Burqa’h. * 2. Draw a square on the Burqa’h. * 3. Place Mouraba 3 in the center of the square, under Daa-ira * 4. Write the name of the angel you want to call upon under Mouraba 3. * 5. Burn incense. * 6. Call upon your angel by using the proper Istijabah. Remember, each angel responds to a particular Istijabah.*** *** ***SO, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:STEP ONE:Cut and place Daa-ira Ilahiya (Below) on the Burqa’h.i_Image4 [images/picture111.jpg]Daa-ira Ilahiya.STEP TWO:Cut this page, or copy Mouraba 3 (Square below) and place it on the Burqa’h,under Daa-ira Ilahiya. This is the only magical square you should use onTuesday.This space is the Burqa’h.i_Image4 [images/picture112.jpg]Mouraba 3.Write here: The name of the angel you want to communicate with.STEP THREE:CALL UPON YOUR ANGEL, BY USING THE PROPER ISTIJABAH.IMPORTANT NOTE:By now, you already know that Angels do not communicate with us in Chinese,French, English, or in any other language we speak. So, when you see or hearso-called mediums or channelers calling this or that angel in English, you tellyourself: Nonsense!! It does not work that way.Sometimes, and as seen on American television, ghost hunters ask a spirit (Forinstance Robin Hood, or Peggy): Robin Hood are you here? Peggy manifestyourself. Peggy are you with us? This is absolutely ridiculous. And the resultsare obvious. Nor Robin or Peggy responds, even though, Robin and Peggy once upona time spoke English. Same thing applies to angels. You must call the angels intheir own language, and use the proper Istijabah.*** *** ***ISTIJABAH FOR ANGEL SERAPH-IIL, THE AFFECTIONATE:ADONAI, ILAHI, IHDAR SERAPH-IIL.SERAPH-IIL, SHARIFINA, IHDAR, BARAKA ALLUHA AL KADER ALEYKA.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Adonai: My lord. * Ilahi: My creator.

The Sahiriin do. In fact, they have amanuscript called “Al Laa’naat Wa Fakkaha”, meaning: “The Curses and How toRemove them”. I find it very ironic, that such a book exists, while theinstructions of Sihr and summoning séances were never written down, or preservedin writing.Allamah Midhat Al Ghazali bin Harithah commented on this. He said verbatim:“Secrets must be kept secret to protect the innocent. This is why we have neverrecorded our teachings in books and manuals. We fear that they might fall intothe hands of bad people. As to the book of curses, we deemed necessary to have amanual on the subject, in order to provide the righteous ones with an immediaterelief.”Note:In volume two, I wrote extensively on how to remove curses, according to theDirasat and Kiraat of the Sahiriin. Whether I do believe in curses or not isirrevelant.I found the book “Al Laa’naat Wa Fakkaha” to be extremely fascinating, and Ihave translated a substantial amount of the Sahiriin’s guidelines andinstructions.I encourage you to refer to volume two.*** *** ***Cut this page, or copy Mouraba 5 (Square below) and place it on the Burqa’h,under Daa-ira Ilahiya.

Nothing is confusing here.Just keep on changing the names of angels, each time you call upon a new angel.*** *** ***IMPORTANT NOTE:Friday is a very special day in the Sahiriin’s calendar.Allamah Bedrawi warned the Taaleb not to stay long in the séances. He meant thatall summoning séances should end before midnight, because on Saturday, badspirits manifest, and some of them have the capability of sneaking in, duringséances conducted on Friday. If you a beginner, you might encounter majordifficulties in sending away unwelcome bad spirits who manifested during yourséances. However, the present good spirits you are conversing with, during thisparticular séance will force the bad spirits to leave. Expect unpleasant displayfrom the evil spirits. For instance, they could throw objects at you. Objectsthat come out of the blue. Do not panic. If this happens, use this command:FASIDA FASIDA, BISMOU AL KHADER IKROUJOU FAWRAN YA AFARIT AL SHARR.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Fasida Fasida: Rotten, rotten. * Bismou: By the name of. * Al: The. * Khader: Khader.

IntroductionII. What is a wrong hour?The wrong hours areIII. What is a right hour (Salhah)?The most favorable hours areI. INTRODUCTION:You can’t contact and summon the spirits and entities all the time. You alreadyknow the good days and the bad days to have a séance with them. But this is notenough, because some days have good and bad time to summon them.There are favorable and unfavorable hours.This means that the spirits and entities will not respond if you call upon themon Fasda (The wrong hour).Thus, you should set up your séance during Salhah (The right hour).II. WHAT IS A WRONG HOUR (FASDA)?A wrong hour is an hour that belongs to a certain time when spirits and entitieswould not respond to your summon for a multitude of reasons that you should notbe concerned about.What you should know is not why they would not respond, but how to make themrespond to your summon, and willingly appear in the séance.THE WRONG HOURS ARE: * a-Any hour on Sunday. * b-Any hour between 2:00 AM and 8:00 AM. * c-Any hour of the last day of each month. * d-Any hour that follows a sexual act, a heavy meal, and a dispute on any day.III. WHAT IS A RIGHT HOUR (SALHAH)?A right hour is an hour that belongs to a certain time when spirits and entitieswould respond to your summon. Basically, and as long as you avoid Fasda, allhours are fair play. However, there are some particular hours of the days thatare more favorable than others.THE MOST FAVORABLE HOURS ARE: * a-Between 7:00 PM and 1:00 AM on Tuesday. * b-Between 8:00 PM and 10:00 AM on Wednesday. * c-Between 8:00 PM and 10:00 AM on Thursday. * d-Between 8:00 PM and 4:00 AM on Friday.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8HAMNIKA MEKHAKEH ILMUTECHNIQUETHE ANUNNAKI - ULEMACALENDAR"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8HAMNIKA MEKHAKEH ILMU TECHNIQUETHE ANUNNAKI - ULEMA CALENDARHAMNIKA-MEKHAKEH: ANA’KH/ULEMITE. NOUN.Grids used by Anunnaki-Ulema as calendar to find the lucky days and the luckyhours in a person’s life.HAMNIKA-MEKHAKEH- ILMU: ANA’KH/ULEMITE. NOUN. TERMThe technique of using the Hamnika-mekhakeh.I. Synopsis of the conceptII. The Ulema-Anunnaki days areIII. The calendars’ gridsIV. The use of a languageV. The preparation and use of the gridsI. SYNOPSIS OF THE CONCEPT:Humans follow certain calendars. The most common one is the Gregorian Calendar,which is a reflection of the Christian faith. It is younger than the Muslimcalendar, which in turn, is younger than the Jewish calendar. All of these areconsiderably younger than the Anunnaki calendar, which is the only one used bythe Anunnaki-Ulema.The Anunnaki-Ulema reject the idea that the week consists of seven days. Theirweek consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of our week. These arethe only days to use in this technique, and the other three days in our weekshould not be calculated upon.II. THE ULEMA-ANUNNAKI DAYS ARE: * Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday) * Day 2: Araba (Wednesday) * Day 3: Jema (Friday) * Day 4: Saba (Saturday).The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and thehours in each day. Using the calendar of the Anunnaki-Ulema, each person canfind the luckiest hour of his or her week, according to the Book of Ramadosh(Rama-Dosh). Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week isnot sufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at workif it occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday.This predicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique, TimeManipulation, on that exact hour. The time that will be added to your life undersuch circumstances will be as lucky as the original hour, and your chances ofsuccess will be vastly improved.”The Anunnaki-Ulema teachers highly recommend performing a combination oftechniques, since each enhances the other considerably.III. THE CALENDARS’ GRIDS:A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, areall people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour?Yes, indeed they would.There are only sixteen grid lines to represent millions of people each. And thisleads to an interesting discovery.The numbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony that existsbetween them.For example, if you wish to approach someone in high places for a favor, findingthat he or she shares the number of letters and the lucky hour will enhance yourchances.Always send your request to him or her during the lucky hour, either by callingon the phone, using your e-mail, or placing a written letter in the mailbox.IV. THE USE OF A LANGUAGE:Another question is the issue of languages. What if your name is written withfour letters in America, where you live, but with five letters in your nativelanguage? The answer is simple.Always use your native language, the language that you were first aware of yourname in, in your grid. It will be much more accurate and certainly morepowerful. An important fact to add is that this technique is simple, but it canbe enhanced in many ways by subtle variations.Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space is relatedto luck and success, and how to fine tune the process. But even in thisstraightforward version, the technique is incredibly powerful, so much so thatit may change your life completely, always for the better.Tip: If any added numbers are higher than one digit, always add the numbers anduse the result. For example, if instead of 3+1+1+1= 6 you will find yourselfwith, say, 4+7+7+7=25, add 2+5 and use the result, namely 7. If you have40+41+42+43=126, add 1+2+6=9.*** *** ***V. THE PREPARATION AND USE OF THE GRIDS:The first step is to prepare a grid of sixteen squares, like the one below.In the next step, you will establish the calendar of the week, by writing themin this specific order.GRID 1: CALENDAR OF THE WEEKDay1 Day2 Day3 Day4 Day2 Day3 Day4 Day1 Day3 Day4 Day1 Day2 Day4 Day1 Day2 Day3 * 1-In the next step, you will establish the calendar of your name. Let’s say your name is Suzan. * 2-You will write your name in the squares, but you must write from right to left, the way they did in many ancient languages, including Ana’kh. * 3-Then, you follow, still from right to left, with the number of the days, 1, 2, 3, 4.*** *** ***GRID 2: CALENDAR OF YOUR NAMEA Z U A 3 2 1 N Z U S 4 2 1 N A*** *** ***CALENDAR OF YOUR LUCKY HOUR * 1-In the next step, you will establish the calendar of your lucky hour. * 2-Look at the two squares above. * 3-Try to find the one square that has the same number in both drawings. * 4-When you compare each square, you will see that the second square in the last raw has the #1 in it. * 5-Fill in the number of the days in the first row, the way it appeared in the first grid.Therefore, Suzan’s lucky hour will occur during the second day. (If more thanone square presents the same number, add the numbers.)*** *** ***GRID 3: CALENDAR OF YOUR LUCKY HOURDay1 Day2 Day3 Day4 1*** *** ***In the next step, we shall start our calculations. * 1-Keep the first row as is. * 2-fill the rest of the grid with the number 1. * 3-In each column, you will now subtract the three #1 from the day in the first row. 1-1-1-1= -2; 2-1-1-1= -1; 3-1-1-1= 0; 4-1-1-1 = 1GRID 4Day1 Day2 Day3 Day4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -2 -1 0 1 * 4-We will now add the number we have calculated. (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 = (-2) * 5-We continue our calculations by using the number we have achieved, -2, as a filler in the grid below, in three rows under the basic days row on top. * 6-Then, we will calculate the values of the columns the way we have done in the previous grid.*** *** ***GRID 5Day1 Day2 Day3 Day4 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -2 -5 -4 -3 -2 * 7-We will add these numbers: (-5) + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) = -14 * 8-We will combine the individual numbers comprising the number fourteen by adding them: 1+ 4 = 5 * 9-We will add these two numbers. (-14) + 5 = -9*** *** ***In the next step: * 1-Return to the first grid, displaying the calendar of the week. * 2-Starting on the second row, count the squares, going from right to left, nine times. * 3-You will reach Day 3. * 4-This establishes that your lucky hour will occur on Friday, the third day of the Anunnaki week. * 5-To establish the hour, go back to Grid 4, and look at the row that expresses Day 3. * 6-Add the numbers: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 * 7-Calculate: (-9) - (+6) = -3 * 8-To establish the hour within the 24 hours in each day subtract, 24 – 3 = 21.21 is 9 P.M.Therefore, Suzan’s luckiest hour of the week occurs at nine o’clock in theevening of each Friday.Note: I have reproduced this segment from my book “Book of Ramadosh:*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9LANGUAGE OF THE SPIRITS * Introduction * II.

Sahiriin ritual words and phrasesI. INTRODUCTION: THE SAHIRIIN LANGUAGE.The spirits and entities have their own language.You can’t summon an entity in English, French or in any other language. You mustcall upon the angels, and summon spirits in the Sahiriin language.The Sahiriin language is not complicated at all. It consists of a few words anda limited number of sentences and spells. You will be able to learn the Sahiriinlanguage in no time. (See Vol.2) Basically, it was developed by the Sahiriin wholived in Persia, Anatolia, the Arab Peninsula, Palestine/Israel, North Africa,and Medieval Europe.I encourage you to read the glossary/terminology to become familiar withSahiriin keywords.This segment of the book provides you with basic words and phrases you must useif you want to summon the entities. And remember, the spirits and entities donot speak English, French or any other language, except their own.Worth mentioning here that the spirits and entities we are referring to are NOTthe deceased people and departed loved ones who lived with us on Earth.They are totally different from humans. And because they are so different fromus, they do not understand our languages, nor do they obey to any command givenin a language made by mankind.*** *** ***II. WHAT IS THE SAHIRIIN LANGUAGE? WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THE SAHIRIN LANGUAGE?The Sahiriin language contains words, terms, names and phrases written in theArwah (Spirits) language.It is not a human language.Although, many Sahiriin words appeared in Kabala, in the Testament of Solomon,in the secret ritual séances of Melkart, in the ancient Arabic pre-dating Islam,in the Sufism literature, the Dervish’s chants, and other black magic chants andspells, they should not be considered as of an Earth’s origin, or derivationsfrom ancient Near Eastern and Middle Eastern terminology.Now, if you are familiar with Hebrew, Aramaic, Ugaritic, Arabic, Phoenician,Persian, and ancient Turkish (Osmani), you might say, well, this or that word isJewish or Arabic or even Chaldean, because this Sahiriin word means the verysame thing in Hebrew, Aramaic, Ugaritic, Arabic, Phoenician, or in any otherlanguage you are familiar with.Yes, many Sahiriin words could mean the very same thing in all those languages,but you should remember that they are of a non-terrestrial/non-human origin.They were brought to Earth, from another dimension; the realm or zone of thespirits. This is why we call the Sahiriin language, the language of the Arwah.*** *** ***III. SAHIRIIN WORDS, SPELLS, AND PHRASES YOU MUST LEARN:Each séance requires the use of very specific words and phrases. However, somewords and commands are used and re-used in multiple séances, because they areconsidered Fatihah (See below) and Khatima (See below). In fact, they should beused at the beginning and the end of all séances.This is the Sahiriin-Spirits-Entities protocol.A-WHAT IS FATIHAH?Fatihah is the opening or the beginning of the séance.Very specific words and commands should be used during this phase. If you don’tuse these particular words and commands, you will not be able to summon thespirits and entities.Here they are:TO OPEN THE SÉANCE, YOU SHOULD START WITH THIS PHRASE:BISMA AL-KHALEK, ANI AMRU HOUDOURAKUM.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Bisma: By the name of. Pronounced: Bee S’mah. * Al-Khalek: The creator of the universe. Pronounced: Al Khaleck (Kha like Jose in Spanish). * Ani: Me or I. Pronounced: Aa Knee (Line knee in English). * Amru: I command.

Pronounced: Hoo Doo Raa Koom.GENERAL MEANING:By the name of the creator, I command you to appear.By the name of the creator, I command (Order) your presence.You should repeat this command three times. And while you are pronouncing thiscommand, keep on looking at your right and your left. We will talk more aboutthis, in other parts of the book.As soon as you start to feel something around you (A feeling, a change intemperature, a cold breeze, a shadow, so on), and/or you observe an ectoplasmicmanifestation of any sort, or a part of the entity that starts to manifestbefore your eyes, you immediately say this:IDKHAL IDKHAL, HOUDOURAKUM KARIM, AHLAN BIKUM, ANI AMURUKUM, WA HAKIM ALEYKUM.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Idkhal Idkhal: Come in.

Pronounced: Haa Keem. * Aleykum: Upon you. Over you. Pronounced: Aa Lay Koom.GENERAL MEANING:Come in. Come in. We honor your presence. Welcome. I command you and I rule overyou.Note:I gave you these two phrases as a specimen, a sample of commands thatcharacterize the Fatihah. There are more phrases to follow, but we will talkabout this, in some other segments of this book. (See Vol.2)But for now, keep in mind, that the Fatihah is the first phase of the séancethat opens up the summon/command, and establishes you as the commander andmaster of the spirits and entities.*** *** ***B- WHAT IS KHATIMA?Khatima is sending away the spirits or entities, and closing the séance. It isthe last and final stage of your communication with the manifested entities.Very specific words and commands should be used during this phase. If you don’tuse these particular words and commands, you will not able to send away thespirits and entities, and close the séance.The manifested entities will not leave you.And if you loose control over them, you will be hurt. In addition, they willtake over everything that surrounds you, including objects, people and pets.You must dispose of them as soon as your wishes are granted. To send them away,you must use the following phrase that characterizes the Khatimah. And there areno more phrases to follow, as it is the case with the Fatihah.Here is the phrase:MASHKOURIIN MASHKOURIIN, KADRIKUM MOUTARAF, BISMA AL- KHALEK WA AL-ASMA HOUSNAKIDRATI IRHALUM IRHALUM.TRANSLATION WORD FOR WORD: * Mashkouriin Mashkouriin: We thank you we thank you.

Andby the name of. the creator of the universe, and the Noble Names, and by virtueof my power over you, I order you to go away.Note: In another section of the book, I will explain the meaning and use of the“Noble Names”.*** *** ***IV.
