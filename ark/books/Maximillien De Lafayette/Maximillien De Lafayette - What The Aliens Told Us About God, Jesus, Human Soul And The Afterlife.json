No more than 40 or 50 books were published at that time, and no videosor clips were posted on the world wide web, the Internet and in social media, asit is the case today. The sphere of the so-called ufology was divided into twocamps;1-The “insiders” who worked for the government on projects and research programsrelated to UFOs.2-The outsiders (Authors, inquisitors and the general public).To a certain degree, 90% of what was written or published was a colorfulliterature on a subject little known to the public or understood by enthusiastsand the masses.De facto, a handful of “thinkers” in the field knew what was going on duringthat period despite the fact of lacking vital data, and reliable informationpertaining to the subjects of UFOs and extraterrestrials.Those who knew “something” were in the military and civilian insiders, who insome shape, form or capacity were part of a very restricted group of scientistsand technicians who were recruited by the military to study and “dissect” theenigmatic phenomenon of flying saucers…and they kept their mouth shut. A possibility…If you are among those who believe that our government’s representatives metwith aliens/extraterrestrials, then, and logically, you should entertain orconsider the possibility that some of the subjects discussed during thosemeetings would be of a religious or at least moral or ethical nature, especiallysince at least three powerful religious leaders in our country attended one ortwo meetings with aliens on an American soil.In fact, this is exactly what happened.And we will be discussing the concerns and the questions of those religiousdignitaries, the answers of the aliens, and how a synopsis of the discussionsbetween our religious leaders and aliens ended up on the desk and in the secretvaults of foreign governments, and religious authorities thanks to theirreligious affiliation and/or loyalty to their faith’s hierarchy!In fact, religious leaders in the United States, in England, and in the Vaticanmanaged to convince the military and The White House to conceal from theAmerican people and from the world any and all revelations and comments given byaliens about religions, God, religious faith, man’s soul, the afterlife, thecreation of the universe, hell and heaven, the Holy Scriptures, Christianity,and Jesus Christ. Nothing is more boring than UFOs and aliens’ TV shows.It is fine and even necessary –for a while– to watch TV shows on aliens,extraterrestrials and UFOs, especially if you are watching them for the firsttime, and/or you are not familiar with such subjects.To the well-informed, and to insiders in particular, nothing is more boring thanthese shows, for the contents of almost each episode are almost identical,repetitive, and rehashed ad infinitum; it is the same stories over and overagain ad nauseam, such as Area 51, Roswell’s UFO crash, MJ12, flying saucersover Washington, aliens’ autopsy, interviews with the same people, authors andwitnesses, conspiracy theorists, and ufologists we got tired and sick of…tiredand sick of seeing their faces and hearing them all the time.After listening to them (The same people) for so long, week after week, monthafter month, year after year, show after show on so many TV networks, andhearing them telling us the same repetitive stories, with their intenseinsistence on governments’ cover-ups, and UFOs’ sighting here and there, we getfed up with them, and we lost interest in UFOs and extraterrestrials.We already know that UFOs exist.So why ufologists and their followers keep on repeating the same old stories(factual or false) and endless accounts of UFOs’ sightings?Because they have nothing else to talk about. And mainly because they are“Outsiders”. Simply put, they have no clues of what is going on “Behind theCurtains”.And “curtains” means the inaccessible, the true, and the secretive world ofextraterrestrials and UFOs known only to governments’ agencies, the military,the CIA, and scientists, who were secretly involved with programs, research andprojects jointly conducted by governments and aliens, and which are far beyondthe reach of ufologists and authors of books on UFOs and extraterrestrials. Alien technology/reverse engineering, and the metaphysical/religious concerns.Between 1947 and 1951, no less than 200 scientists and technicians wererecruited by the United States Air Force, the Pentagon, and the CIA to study thephenomenon of UFOs, sightings’ reports, witnesses’ accounts, crashes’ sites,recovery of crashed UFOs, and above all alien technology and reverseengineering.The main interest of our government was focused on and rotated around alientechnology, and how this technology could be reversed, duplicated, produced, andeventually used as weapons’ systems.The subjects pertaining to the religious and metaphysical aspects of the aliens’phenomenon were not en rigueur, for they were addressed and discussed forrelatively a very short period in 1947 and 1948. By the end of March 1948, thesesubjects were no longer of any interest to the military and the CIA, for obviousreasons, which I will refer to in forthcoming chapters.By June 1948, these subjects were no longer discussed by our government.However, the Church, and especially the Vatican in Rome remained vividly andardently preoccupied by these subjects, and consequently, a large and a secretlibrary/department (On UFOs and aliens’ topics) at the Vatican were establishedby a Papal order issued by Pope Pius XII. Revealing statistics:Here are some statistics for you: * 91% of books and papers published on UFOs, aliens, and extraterrestrials published between 1971 and 2016 constantly refer to governments’ cover-ups and conspiracies. * 92% discuss identical topics. * 94% contain almost similar reports on UFOs’ sightings and witnesses’ accounts. * 82% of authors and ufologists relentlessly talk about alien abduction and/or the alien’s agenda. * 98% of TV shows on aliens and UFOs flash before our very own eyes, the same and repetitive stories and reports, such as: The “Roswell Daily Record” newspaper’s headline of a UFO’s crash nearby Roswell (RAAF Captures Flying Saucer on Ranch in Roswell Region), and Major Jesse Marcel showing the debris (wreckages) of a weather’s balloon, etc. * 91% of TV shows on aliens and UFOs repeat the same stories about Area 51, produce the same photos of military signs warning intruders about the use of deadly force in “Restricted Area”, so on…After a while, it gets extremely boring!See pertinent photos on the following pages. *** *** ***[../images/00004.jpeg] Front page of the Roswell Daily Record. [../images/00005.jpeg] How many times have you seen this photo?Area 51 “Restricted Area” sign, so dear to ufologists and TV shows’ hosts.___________________________ [../images/00006.jpeg] How many times have you seen this photo?Major Jesse Marcel showing the debris (wreckages) of a weather’s balloon. It isgetting too repetitious, monotonous and boring!_________________________________ What is more important?Don’t you think that there are more important subjects and aspects of UFOs andaliens we should talk about and explore for the benefit of humanity than UFOs’sightings?In your opinion, what is more important, a repetitive story of a UFO’s crash weheard zillions of times before or what the aliens have told us about the fabricof the universe, their habitats, the fabricated concept of God, the reason forthe creation of religions, the “Soul” and the future of humanity in thisdimension and the world beyond?What is more informative, more important, and more enlightening, a report onUFOs’ sightings over Washington, or the reason why aliens hover over our cities,the purpose of their visit, or the message of a multi-dimensional galacticcivilization and its impact on our life and future? In my sincere opinion, what is more important and more vital than a story abouta UFO’s sighting, ufologists’ meaningless and superficial visits to Area 51, ora UFO’s crash, Is what the aliens themselves have revealed to us in a series ofmeetings in 1947 and 1948, about the greatest secrets of the universe, themystery of the creation, space and time, and the fate of man, such as: * 1-The reality of God; does the concept or idea of a God exist on other planets? * 2-Do aliens believe in God? Yes? No? And why? * 3-Do aliens believe in reincarnation? * 4-Do aliens have a soul? * 5-Do humans have a soul or something else which animates the physical body? Nobel Prize winner, and the Discoverer of Human DNA, Dr. Francis Crick wrote: “The astonishing hypothesis is, that there is no soul. The soul is not more or less than the neural processes in our brain.” The Anunnaki Ulema claim that human beings do not have a soul per se, but rather a cellular energy emanating from the human brains. In other words, the soul is a religious invention, while the MIND is an absolute reality. * 6-Is Jesus known to aliens? * 7-Who really created the human race? * 8-Life after death. How aliens explained to us the realm of the world beyond. Do aliens believe in hell and heaven? * 9-Who is keeping the Universe in order? * God or a cosmic equilibrium? * And what is cosmic equilibrium? * And who is God? * 10-Biological structure and organism of the bodies of aliens, extraterrestrials and intraterrestrials. * 11-Who created us? God of the Bible? * Cosmic dust? * The stars? * Or aliens themselves?These are the questions and topics I shall be addressing in this book. *** *** *** The meta-physical and spiritual aspects of aliens:I am fascinated by the meta-physical and spiritual aspects of aliens(Extraterrestrials and Intraterrestrials), because deep down in my heart andsomewhere in the dark corners of my mind, I am still wondering whether aliensprogress, and evolve spiritually, mentally and meta-physically.Some have said that highly advanced societies including galactic civilizationsare usually more peaceful and more spiritual than other communities and lowercivilizations on the ladder of enlightenment, knowledge and science.Therefore, we have no reason at all to fear extraterrestrials because they arehighly advanced.But is it true?Not at all.Dr. Stephen Hawking said: “We should avoid any contact with them…most certainly,their belief systems (religious and social) could be in sharp contrast withours. If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as whenChristopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn’t turn out very wellfor the Native Americans.”Earth’s history convinced us that once upon a time the most advanced societies-technically and scientifically- were the most violent and the most threateningones.Take for example, the Roman Empire; a fabulous and majestic empire, still, oneof the most oppressive and violent empires which crucified hundreds of thousandsof people, threw human beings in the gladiators’ arenas to be devoured alive bylions and wild cats.The Roman law was considered the pillar of European laws for centuries, yet, itallowed slavery, tortures, crucifixion, dismembering people, and barbarism.Alexander of Macedonia is called Alexander the Great, and his nation’s glory wasbuilt upon his conquests and wars. His brutal conquests adhered to hisgreatness; yet, Alexander the great destroyed almost each and every civilizationin the ancient Middle East and Near East, and slaughtered women and children inTyre in ancient Phoenician and destroyed majestic civilizations like the greatEmpire of Darius of Persia. The Romans and the Greeks were highly advanced,philosophically, socially, and scientifically, yet they were among the cruelestand bloodiest civilizations in recorded history. And most recently, we havewitnessed what the most advanced nation on Earth in science, music, physics,chemistry, biology, engineering, performing arts, medicine, psychology,anthropology, and psychiatry, has done to millions of innocent people, theelderly, women and children, and how it annihilated country after country inEurope during World War Two with air raids, tanks, bombs, and biologicalwarfare!I am referring to Nazi Germany, then, the most advanced nation on Earth, yet themost brutal and savage one in recorded history. So, advancement and progress, science and knowledge do not categoricallyguarantee spiritual evolution, peace, fairness, equality, goodness, and justice.This leads us to pose the following questions:1-Are aliens spiritually developed?2-Do they believe in God? What kind of a God?3-Do they have a religion? Any sort of religion?4-Do they believe in a Biblical justice?5-Do they believe in a Final Judgement?6-Do they believe in Hell and heaven?7-Do they share our religious beliefs and social ethics? Yes? No? Why?Those are the subjects which constitute the core of this book.Believe it or not, the spiritual (Quasi-religious) aspect and meta-physicalworld of aliens were discussed at one time during two meetings we had withaliens, somewhere in the United States. It did happen, and I wish I couldconvince the skeptics and debunkers, but even if I could, it would not change aninch from the landscape of their skepticism, denial and ridicule. C’est la vie! Needless to say, our military and our military scientists were not interested inthat “etheric-moral” aspect of aliens. Their interest rotated exclusively aroundalien technology, and how it could be used as weapons systems, and a tool todominate the world. This was then, and still is la soupe du jour. Nevertheless,the few anthropologists, sociologists, linguists and clergymen who were asked toattend the first official meeting with aliens on a military base in the UnitedStates were extremely interested in the meta-physical and spiritual world ofaliens. And I will reproduce in this book their questions, their dialogues withaliens and the aliens’ answers.It would take the world’s communities decades before the question of aliens’spirituality could be re-addressed and seriously re-examined.It is acknowledged that a considerable number of authors and those who believein flying saucers and in our “Aliens-Brothers from Heaven” wrote books andpapers on the celestial, divine and spiritual message and aspect of aliens, butunfortunately, the majority of their work appeared to be New Age, New Religion,New Guru-ism literature, despite their sincere efforts to shed bright light onthe topic. Yes, they failed in discussing the issue, simply because they were “Outsiders”,and were never part or members of the very exclusive inner circle whichmonopolized the entirety of knowledge and discovery of the mind-bending world ofaliens. The Church knows a lot!The Catholic Church (Eastern and Roman) knows a lot about the aliens’revelations pertaining to the origin of man, God’s nature, and the human soul.But the “Princes of the Church” are not talking for obvious reasons. I willattempt to elucidate those reasons via the direct answers of the aliens we metwith in 1947 and 1948. My chat with Cardinal Bertoli.In the late sixties I discussed some of those subjects with Cardinal Meouchi,Patriarch of the Maronite Church, and Monsignor Jean Maroun. And once again inthe seventies, I had a chat with Cardinal Bertoli, then Nuncio of the Vatican.My chat with Cardinal Bertoli.-Your eminence, have you read the “Aliens Transcripts”?-Cardinal: What do you mean?-The transcripts of the meetings of the Americans with the aliens in 1947 and1948?-Cardinal (Smiling): Yes.-What is the position of the Church vis-à-vis the aliens’ revelations?-Cardinal: God created our world and many worlds to be discovered.-You mean we are not alone in the universe.-Cardinal: I mean we are not alone in the universe.-Where did you read about the “Aliens Transcripts”?-Cardinal: In Rome.-You mean at the library of the Vatican?-You can say that…of course not the public library.-You mean there is a library or perhaps a section in the Vatican’s library whichcontains the transcripts and….is not accessible to the public?-Cardinal: Correct.-Which part or parts from the transcripts interested you most?-Cardinal: Many in fact…per esempio Jesus, the question of the human salvation,the creation of the human race and he universe, life after death, theimmortality of the soul, the Holy Church…-According to the aliens, the human race was not created by God.-Cardinal: Never question your faith.Never doubt the Holy Church.I careless about what the aliens said.-One final question your eminence and I will keep my mouth shut. The aliens toldthe Americans that Jesus Christ was not a Jew nor the Messiah but a Phoenicianhealer born in an area located between Sidon (Saida) and Tyre (Sour) in ancientPhoenicia…(Interrupted by the cardinal, who began to show a very visible anger.)-Cardinal: Blasphemy! Finish…end of the discussion…basta cosi! Note: I honestly believe that the answers of his eminence are self-explanatory. *** *** ***Archivum Secretum Apostolicum Vaticanum (The Secret Archives of the Vatican):In addition to historical records, the secret archives of the Vatican contain236 reports and 87 in-depth articles/texts pertaining to aliens andextraterrestrial life, written in Latin and in Italian, as well as 7 dossierswritten in Italian and in English on the “Aliens Transcripts” of 1947 and 1948.These secret archives on aliens and the American “Aliens Transcripts” are notavailable to researchers and/or to the general public.Only 8 persons have/had access to the secret archives of aliens and the AmericanAliens Transcripts:1-The Pope.2-Bishop Sergio Pagano, the Prefect of the archives.3-Cardinal Raffaele Farina, the chief Librarian.4-Archbishop Martino, a Prefect Emeritus of the Archives.5-Cardinal Jorge Maria Mejia.6-Cardinal Luigi Poggi, former head of the secret archives.7-Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, former Dean of the College of Cardinals.8-Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, the successor of Cardinal Tisserant. The Secret files of the Eastern Maronite Church. The Al Kaslik Monastery Papers:Maronite priest, Father Hanna Saloum told me verbatim that President Kennedyasked the Patriarch Paul Boutros Meouchi about the “Al Kaslik Monastery Papers”,which contained earth-shattering information pertaining to extraterrestrials,and especially the revelations of an alien race concerning Jesus Christ.Father Saloum added “President Kennedy was just curious and the Patriarch toldhim a little bit about the subject, but he made a reference to a Syriac documentand to an Arabic scroll which mentioned the presence of an alien race whichinteracted with people from the Levant.”He continued “I am fully aware that the Al Kaslik Monastery has a translated acopy of the original records of a meeting of aliens with the Americans, whereAmerican bishops addressed the issues of Jesus Christ, Christianity and otherreligious matters during meetings with aliens in America.” [../images/00007.jpeg] President John F.

These races died out not because of famine,ecological catastrophes, or acts of war, but because of the disintegration ofthe very molecules and composition of their cells.The scrolls revealed that some of these species were not created by God, and theAnunnaki, the gods and goddesses of Mesopotamia created the “final form” ofhuman beings by “upgrading” some of those archaic quasi-human creatures.Document #2: A scroll written in an early form of Aramaic contained a passagewhich referred to the area located between Sidon and Tyre in Phoenicia as thebirth place of Jesus Christ.It also contained a paragraph which ascertained that Jesus Christ was not a Jewbut a Roman-Phoenician citizen.Coincidentally, or perhaps astonishingly, the alien we met in 1947 told us thatJesus Christ was in fact a Phoenician healer, and not a Jew.And Eusebius, the Bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine, had genealogical records ofthe remnants of the Anunnaki who became Syriac, and a disputed Phoeniciangenealogy of Jesus Christ. [../images/00009.jpeg] Eusebius, the Bishop of Cæsarea.At the Council of Antioch in 363 A.D., Bishop Eusebius in his \"Theophania\"intended to bring these subjects to the attention of the members of the Council.Unfortunately, no additional information or related documents about what hashappened at the Council were found. *** *** *** "},{"pageContent":"Zachariah of Mitylene: [../images/00010.jpeg] Zachariah of Mitylene_______________________________ In the Syriac (Syriani) manuscripts of Zachariah of Mitylene, who frequentlycorresponded with Eupraxius, two of his letters which made reference to thePhoenician ethnic origin of Jesus Christ and to the Anunnaki as the ancestors ofthe Ashurian-Syriac people were found. Bishop Proterius tried to destroy theseletters. Fortunately, two separate hand-written copies of said letters were made, as thetradition of the era dictated, and were saved in the vault of a scribe.Those letters resurfaced in 1957 in the personal acquisition of CardinalMeouchi, the Patriarch of the Maronite Church in Lebanon. After Meouchi’s death,those letters were kept in the secret vaults of Al-Kaslik Monastery in Lebanon. *** *** *** [../images/00011.jpeg] Bishop Proterius__________________________________ Bishop Ignatius (Ignace) Ziade:Father Hanna Saloum, a protégé of the powerful Ignatius (Ignace) Ziade, theMaronite Archbishop of Beirut, let me know that Archbishop Ziade has told himthat the scrolls and letters which mentioned the genealogy of Jesus Christ asPhoenician, and recorded his “straight” bloodline were first discovered inJerusalem by Les Templiers (Knights Templar), and became the most preciouspossession of Jacques de Molay the grand master of the Templars Order.

Apparently, French peasants believed that celestial crafts were flown by peoplewho carried stolen vegetables and fruits from their harvest and were taken awayto their land. Legend has it that three men and woman fell from the ships andwere stoned to death by the peasants. Writers of the era believed that Magoniawas the land of black magic inhabited by aliens and beings from another world. [../images/00017.jpeg] Spaceships of Magonia.______________________________ In modern times: A possible alien UFO taken for a miracle.B.V.M. (Virgin Mary’s apparition in Fatima and the UFO allegory)___________________________ But confusing alien UFOs’ sightings with so-called “Divine Apparitions”,“Celestial Lights”, and messages from saints also occur, and are vividlydebated.Do aliens disguise themselves like saints?Do aliens appear to some in the form of orbs?Do aliens, UFOs, or other ethereal apparitions convey messages to humanity?Although, the B.V.M. is remotely linked to aliens who talked to us about JesusChrist, I still believe it is quite a propos to discuss this extraordinaryapparition, for it strengthens the link and association of aliens-UFOs to andwith religious imageries, religious beliefs, and the place and role of aliensand alien spaceships on the landscape of faith, and in the lore of religiousbeliefs. B.V.M. is an acronym for the Blessed Virgin Mary, referred to in the context ofVirgin Mary’s apparitions as animated entities, like a CE3. The apparitions ofthe Virgin Mary to three children, Lucia, Francisco, and Jacinta took place inFatima, Portugal in 1917. *** *** *** [../images/00018.jpeg] Lucia, Francisco, and Jacinta._________________________________ Numerous New Age followers, and spiritualists believe that the “DivineApparitions of Virgin Mary” are closely related to UFOs on ametaphysical/religious level.Of course the Catholic Church has refused this “religious assumption”.On September 13, 1917, Monsignor J. Quaresma described the apparition as anaerial globe. He stated verbatim, “To my surprise, I see clearly and distinctlya globe of light advancing from east to west, gliding slowly and majesticallythrough the air.”It was exactly and precisely this “globe of light” which led ufology’senthusiasts to conclude that the globe was in deed a UFO. *** *** *** [../images/00019.jpeg] Artist’s vision of the apparition of the Virgin Mary._________________________________ Dr. Joseph Garret, professor of natural sciences at Columbia University said,“The globe (Sun’s disc) did not remain immobile.

President Truman.Truman, Eisenhower and George Bush, Sr. are considered to be the mostknowledgeable presidents on matters related to aliens, the Grays (Greys) inparticular, and UFOs.There is quite a few top secret Presidential memoranda signed by President HarryTruman, President Dwight Eisenhower and President Richard Nixon, which gave fullauthority to an intelligence agency to disseminate false information aboutaliens and UFOs in order to confuse and disorient the Soviet Union. And in aseparate set of verbal communiqués and instructions by President Harry Trumanand President Dwight Eisenhower, our presidents made it clear to the Pentagonand to our intelligence agencies to never “say a word” or mention anything aboutthe aliens’ revelations regarding organized religions, Christianity, and God. In one of President Truman’s memoranda, a reference was made to the aliens’influence and total control over strategic military points that could causeembarrassment to the United States Air Force, Navy and Army, and the “chaos andmass hysteria” which could be caused by what we have learned from the aliensabout the origin of the human race, the human soul, and the false teachings ofreligions.Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower ordered that these subjects ingeneral and the aliens’ revelations in particular should NEVER be made public,and shared with any American institution.Although President Harry Truman gave full authority to an intelligence agency totake care of the aliens’ business, secretly he created his own committee tooversee what the agency was doing, and how the clergy is coping with theAliens-Earth’s Religions question. Reverend Billy Graham was constantlyconsulted on this matter. It is very ironic, because in a previous memo, and during a verbal communicationwith the director of the agency, President Truman made it clear that he is NOTinterested in reading the reports and findings of the agency on UFOs and alienshe called “Space Monkeys.”In fact, it is not so ironic, if you know a little bit about the character ofPresident Truman.He did it and said it on purpose, so he would and could legally and “honestly”deny any knowledge of the aliens, UFOs, and their “revolutionary impact” on ourreligions.He did so in order to protect the “integrity of the office of the President ofthe United States.”Later on, it was found out that President Truman’s intention was much muchbroader.President Truman wanted to set the foundation of isolating any politician, anysenator, any congressman, including future presidents and the American publicfrom knowing anything about UFOs and aliens.The man did not trust anybody! His last communications with the director of theagency would occur exclusively in the Oval Office, and only Marshall was allowedto be present. Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal was barred from allmeetings. Forrestal was “quarantined” on the 16th floor suite of the BethesdaNaval Hospital for psychiatric evaluation and intensive “mental” care.On May 22, 1949, the ousted Forrestal committed suicide at the Bethesda NavalHospital, Maryland, USA.Report on his death as issued by the hospital stated that he jumped from awindow in the 16th floor hall. A very close associate of his, said they killedhim! The Secretary was taken by force to Bethesda Naval Hospital, on order fromPresident Truman.And around the clock, 4 MP were guarding his room.A polite way to say, he was under a constant watch, not for his own safety, butto make sure that what was “planned” will be carried out without interferenceand suspicion.Many observers believed that Forrestal was the first official victim ofUFOs/Aliens cover-up. However, insiders could not keep their mouth shot,frustrated, they spread the rumors that hired operatives from and intelligenceagency with the help of hitmen killed Secretary James V. Forrestal and threw himout from a window at the 16th floor at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. [../images/00025.jpeg] President Truman with Defense Secretary James V.

The CIA quite rightfully andlegally withheld delicate information on these subjects because revealing suchinformation and declassifying very sensitive files would absolutely jeopardizenational security, the safety, and sanity of the American people, as well asmany people around the globe.It was not the CIA which decided to keep the UFO question an Above Top Secretmatter, but two powerful (Former) Presidents, and an extremely influentialcommittee/panel consisting of Archbishops, the nations’ leading scientists, andcommanding generals from the army and the air force. http://www.israelnewsagency.com/abbaeban.jpg [../images/00027.jpeg]Abba Eban(Standing in the center) with US President Harry Truman and Israeli PrimeMinister Ben-Gurion._______________________________ "},{"pageContent":"http://www.jhvc.org/eban/graphics/speeches.jpg [../images/00028.jpeg]Abba Eban [../images/00029.jpeg]David Ben Gurion"},{"pageContent":"general hoyt [../images/00030.jpeg] General Hoyt S. Vandenberg_____________________________________ General Hoyt S. Vandenberg’s intimidation and cover-up:One of the master-minds of aliens’ saga-coverup was General Hoyt S. Vandenberg,a hero in his own right, who was considered to be one of the most feared andpowerful generals in American history. Probably, the General was right inpreventing the public from having access to the aliens’ revelations andmessages, taking into consideration that UFOs were a “military secret”, andrevealing what the aliens told us about our religions and religious beliefs willunquestionably shatter the very foundation of Christianity. I totally agree withhim.However, I totally disagree with General Vandenberg’s tactics to deceive andeven to intimidate all those (military, high ranking officers, scientists) whowere assigned the duties to investigate German military technology and report onUFOs and distort the truth! In my opinion, he was the architect par excellenceof the most elaborate UFOs’ cover-ups in military history.Here is a brief synopsis of what he did.In April 1948, intensive investigations and assessment of German UFOs, as wellas recent UFOs’ sightings reports were sent to General Vandenberg, for in thatyear, the General was in charge of everything related to UFOs.The reports included very clear photos of UFOs, new testimonies by Germanscientists, and witnesses’ accounts (Pilots and military-men who saw the UFOs).The General refused the reports and commented that the UFOs’ sightings and thewitnesses’ accounts should not be taken seriously for lack of evidence.In other words, he categorically rejected everything!Why the General did not believe his own people?And why did he discredit the professional assessment of military experts?But did he? No, the General believed every word in the reports, but he wanted tocrash all sorts of stories about UFOs, and communications with aliens.The general silenced witnesses, and discouraged anybody from reporting on suchdelicate matters, including his own men.Furthermore, he instructed his people to describe the UFOs’ sightings as hoaxes,to discredit and ridicule all those who came forward and reported UFOs’sightings. In addition, he threatened captains, majors and colonels who pursuedand authenticated UFOs sightings and credible reports, and he let them know thatthey will be court-martialed if they revealed anything pertaining to UFOs andextraterrestrials. *** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"The church was an active participant of a major cover-up.American Catholic archbishops and evangelist preacher Billy Graham attendedmeetings between the United States and aliens on an American soil.The two very influential American Catholic Archbishops were instrumental inshaping the non-disclosure policies about the UFO’s crash near Roswell, thedissemination of information about the existence of extraterrestrials, andreligious dogmas which were ridiculed by the aliens.

Aliens and intraterrestrials do not give individuals, and so-called contacteesand abductees, personal messages to be delivered to humanity.Aliens (Extraterrestrials and intraterrestrials) rarely talk to abductees,almost never; no reason to.In some rare instances, they express “something” by slowly and gradually raisingtheir hands or directly staring at individuals, who are usually in a state oftotal shock, fear, confusion, and paralysis. The telepathic communicationbetween an alien intraterrestrial and so-called contactees and abductees is avery rare phenomenon.It only occurs when the individual is an exceptionally alert person, who remainscoherent, and does not succumb to panic and emotional disturbances, and does notfall into a state of trauma or paralysis. The aliens transmit their messages and thoughts mentally, not telepathically,because for the telepathic phenomenon to occur, you need 2 telepathic persons; 2well-coordinated stations:1-Emiter/Sender (Alien)2-Receiver (Contactee)And most certainly, contactees who are regular folks are neither gifted nortrained telepaths.Thus, telepathic communication is either impossible or exceptionally rare.Worth mentioning here that communication with aliens is not ipso facto atelepathic or a mental process. According to the alien we met (At the firstmeeting), “To entities on other planets and multi-dimensional zones, eyes likeours are not needed” for they use different organs to see; some use skins pores,others cells in the brain.And their brain (Cellular Motor) is not necessary located inside a skull; itcould be found anywhere under the skin, or on the surface, even stored in acollective awareness.As such, the Cellular Motor’s transmission of thoughts and signs to humans isindecipherable by us. Everything we knew about aliens and extraterrestrials, includingintraterrestrials, Greys (Grays) and humanoids, their bio-organic structure,physical attributes, ways of communications, their worlds/dimensions, andhabitats came directly from meetings we had with them since 1947.De facto, we had numerous meetings with them in the United States and abroad.The most significant ones occurred in 1947 and 1948. It was an eye-opener. Characteristic “features” of our first communication with an alien in 1947: Communication via a device.Throughout the entire meeting which occurred in 1947, the alien was notcommunicating with us verbally; no sound was heard from her.Her communication was directly transmitted from her brain (cellular motor) tothe device she gave us.The alien’s device would receive her thoughts and answer in colors, images,frequencies, and dots similar to the Morse code. At the far end of the machine,there was a screen which displayed dots, multiple dots, empty spaces, andslashes and deciphered the letters and forms. After the transmission has beendisplayed on the screen, the machine would talk to us in a most unusual Englishvocabulary.For example, the alien never said that she has a body, instead she said she hadan “Essence.” It took the military quite a while to re-interpret her expressionsand terms into a proper English. And, quite often, they missed the point.A major part of her mind’s transmission was lost in the translation. Later on, the military decided firmly that top notch linguists in the countryshould be present at all meetings with the aliens, hopefully to help translateand interpret the alien languages and expressions correctly.Weeks later, I discovered that this was absolutely true because the alien’sdevice contained a limited amount of English vocabulary.And the words used mentally by the alien, technologically transmitted anddisplayed by the machine were those often used by the military in their dailylife- normal everyday slang. It was very obvious to me, that all her answerswere not given to us with technological and scientific terms.At one point the female alien told us she avoided that on purpose. In the first two meetings, 2 complicated and complex tools/ machines were usedby the aliens to talk to us.The aliens carried with them a special device in a circular metallic box(Voice-box, also called VB); they had two different kinds of boxes they used incommunicating with us. However, in meetings to follow, the aliens began to speakto us in English.In the second meeting, the aliens gave us the Translation Signals Box (TSB),which allowed us to respond to their communications and messages.Later on, the TCB (Transmission Channel Box), originally “Channel of thetransmissions frequency of aliens” was used. Contrary to a general belief, thealiens did not talk to us telepathically. On their device, they had therecordings of all the languages and dialects of Earth, including versions oftheir own languages.However, they have never communicated with us using their own languages, for thedevice they used to communicate with us was especially designed to use Earth’slanguages. A pre-scheduled meeting:The first meeting with aliens was a pre-scheduled and an agreed upon event. Thealiens told us where and when they will meet with us, and the military agreed.According to notes from the Aliens Transcripts (AT), Section 9: Addendum12-Briefing 341-E1, 1947, this first meeting was arranged by an alien who was inthe custody of the United States Air Force.At the bottom of the page, there is an arrow and a reference made to a certain“Lt. Colonel S…” who coordinated the meeting. On the next page, top left, onecould read the following: “No outfits”, which means that those who waited forthe arrival of the aliens did not wear any particular suits or protective suits. The alien who arranged the first meeting:The alien who arranged the first meeting between our government and the aliensremained at a military base for approximately 3 months and 4 days, and laterdied.Her body was sent to a military hospital in Maryland.The alien was captured after her spacecraft crashed, for missing to “jump” intothe time-space pocket, needed to enter and exit a physical dimension. The threeother aliens died on impact. The one who survived was a female alien-hybrid,although no genital organs were visible. Generalities:Representatives from our government’ agencies (Military and civilian) metseveral times with aliens, intraterrestrials and extraterrestrials in manyplaces, on military bases in the United States.High echelon/top brass in the military (Army, Navy, Air Force), the nations’very best scientists, codes decipherers and breakers, and linguists working forgovernments and semi-official organizations attended those meetings.In the two first meetings, two members of the clergy (Catholic Bishops) and avery prominent preacher were present.Numerous briefings of rapports with aliens and aliens’ transcripts are wellpreserved in secret vaults.Worth mentioning here that the United States government met with differentaliens races on many occasions.And the spectrum of the discussions is ad infinitum.In the original and first report on an alien, which also contained “medicalobservations”, it was noted that the surviving alien has no gender. Later on, ina communiqué sent to the Pentagon, the surviving alien’s gender was acknowledgedas a male; however, no genital organs were visible.The story is getting more complicated, since rumors start to circulate that thealien was a female indeed, because herself told them about her gender in thefirst historical meeting.I tend to believe that the surviving alien was de facto a female; ahybrid-female, not totally Grey.

Generalities:In addition to the military brass, psychiatrists, neurologists and teams ofscientists who questioned the aliens, few anthropologists, linguists, andhistorians were allowed to attend some meetings, and ask the aliens questionsabout our religions, God, the Bible, Jesus, the history of human civilization,and various early humans settlements in different parts of the world.I found their interest in these subjects very refreshing, since they exploredthe very core and very foundation of our history’s birth, civilization anddevelopment.A professor from Harvard asked the aliens about the first human settlement onEarth, and our ancestors’ use of early tools. Another professor from Yale askedabout the early form of human communities in Africa and the Middle East.A distinguished scholar from Princeton asked about the veracity of historicaltexts carved on clay tablets and slabs.A university professor from Pennsylvania asked about the first established(systematic/organized) human community in Mesopotamia.The aliens told us a lot about our religions, God, our origin, the customs,habits and way of life of the earliest organized human communities.For instance, the aliens told us that our history did not start in Mesopotamiabut in Turkey; they meant a well-civilized human community, but they made itclear to us that the first human settlement that can be described as a “a humancell or community” started some 120,000 years ago, in pre-history, during theMiddle Palaeolithic Period in Barda Balka and Hazar Merd in ancient Iraq.A regional flood in the Middle East wiped them out and decimated their habitats.Then the alien continued to tell us that during the Upper Paleolithic Period,some 35,000 ago, another human civilization came to life in Zarzi, Palegawra andother regions of Northern Iraq, particularly in the upper region of KurdistanZagros Mountains.Concurrently, highly advanced communities flourished in Phoenicia and thenorthern part of Anatolia. Asking the aliens whether extraterrestrials had any influence in speeding up theprocess of human evolution, languages and intelligence, and the aliens said,yes, but only in some parts of Earth.The aliens told us for instance that the early humans did not look human at all.Some walked on three legs, others on four legs like animals; they could nottalk, they could not reason, and they could not understand their environment,but had an enormous physical strength, endurance, and could see things very faraway, and hear better than many of the animals of their time. Their eyes weretheir primordial and principle tool of communication with each other, withanimals and with nature.A highly advanced galactic race from Ashta.Ri Constellation System (Aldebaran)came to Earth and upgraded existing human-animal species they captured inCentral Africa and the Amazon area in Brazil.Early humans or pre-historic humans-animals’ species were not aware that otherspecies like them lived in different part of Earth.And contrary to our general belief they did not migrate from one continent toanother, told us the aliens. Some of the early human species were not very muchdifferent from the Modern Man, only those who lived in Central Africa, Brazil,South-East Asia were very different from other quasi-human species because theywere not totally humans.Our early (Earliest is more accurate) ancestors who lived in Mesopotamia duringthe Pre-Historic Paleolithic Period looked very different from those who livedin Africa and Brazil and surrounding areas. Numerous human and quasi-humanforms, species and life-forms existed and co-existed on Earth.Only those who were genetically upgraded or “modified” by extraterrestrialssurvived, developed and influenced the course of history and humancivilizations.The aliens referred to the early inhabitants of Turkey-Anatolia, Phoenicia, andMesopotamia, modern day Iraq. They did not even mention the early Egyptians.Thus, the Theory “Out-of-Africa” is wrong *** *** *** "},{"pageContent":"Excerpts from vital information and instructions we received from the aliens in1947 and 1948._________________________________ Some information and instructions are verbatim, and few are herewith reproducedwith minor editing and revision based upon compared notes and translation bymilitary scientists, civilian linguists, and personnel who operated the aliens’communication devices.Note: Additional material and commentaries pertaining to the alien’s informationand revelations (Scientific and metaphysical) are provided in numerous books Iwrote on the subject in the past.Our governments have extensive files on aliens.The files and dossiers encompass everything the aliens told us about any and allaspects and facets of humanity, our origin, our history, how religions werecreated, how the concept of God was invented, Jesus Christ and his disciples,early Christianity, Judaism, the future of the human race, futuristic science,you name it. The importance of ufology should not rotate exclusively around UFOs and exoticspacecrafts (Aliens or man-made); there are much more important subjects weshould learn about, and focus our attention upon, such as our origin, theveracity of recorded history, and major (forgotten or missed) events in thehistory of humanity and planet Earth that we are not aware of, ourfuture/destiny, the influence and impact of galactic civilizations on ourculture, religious beliefs, social systems, our future and Earth’s fate.Fortunately, a great deal of information on these subjects were provided byaliens and extraterrestrials we have met with on numerous occasions.Herewith are some mind-blowing excerpts from transcripts which have recorded theinformation and knowledge we got from them.Note: Alien’s answers were displayed on the “Speaking Voice”, which is acommunication device the alien gave us to facilitate our dialogue with them.Although the device had the possibility to translate almost 90% of what thealiens told us, a large part of the translation and interpretation was notadequately transmitted to us during the meetings.The aliens used their Cellular Motor (Brain/mind) to transmit their thoughts,and our military scientists and creative linguists interpreted the messages tothe best of their ability. Consequently, and as anticipated, a major part of thealiens’ thoughts and messages was totally lost in the translation and theinterpretation. *** *** *** Aliens and Religion:Aliens do not talk about spirituality and God. Contrary to a common and popularbelief in ufology’s circles and New Age ideology, aliens do not talk aboutspirituality, saints, God, Jesus and other prophets.But it did happen a few times, when some abductees asked the aliens about God,death, after-death, heaven, hell, the final judgment, reincarnation, and thereturn of Jesus Christ.Aliens are not concerned with religious spirituality, for they do not have areligion.The alien told us that the idea of God was created when the first“quasi-intelligent” beings discovered fire.Worth mentioning here that, also, the early humans called fire “God”. Fire wasthe first god or supernatural power they worshipped, followed by the stars. *** *** *** "},{"pageContent":"Q&A from the first meeting with an alien.__________________________ On God:Did God create us?Q: Can you explain our origin? And did God create us?Alien: Some of you were made from cosmic fibers you call it dust (cosmic dust).Others were the product of what you call photosynthesis or biosynthesis.And the rest were genetically reproduced and updated by a highly advanced race,not from Earth.And your origin is more animal than human.And at the beginning of your time on earth, some of your species, looked likereptilians, frogs, birds and other aquatic creatures.Some of your early human species, walked on three legs, others on four. And youcould not tell the difference from one specie to another because all belonged tothe early form of the animalistic world or animals’ world. What you call God hadnothing to do with the creation of your race.Q: So you are telling us we are animals?Alien: The answer is already in your question.Note: On this subject, I am herewith reproducing Anati’s account, anAldebaran-Earth hybrid, and she is referring to “B’nat Nour” (Women of theLight); the early female-form on earth. Anati’s account; B’nat Nour (Women of the Light):Contrary to all religious beliefs, including what Judaism, Christianity andIslam taught you, Eve was not created from the rib of Adam. Men were createdfrom an early female form that was “fertilized” by the leaders and the elite ofthe Aldebaran Anunnaki.They lived in quarantined cities, and had both sons and daughters fathered bythe Anunnaki.Some of the most puzzling sites of these cities, due to their size andfunctionality, were in Ur, Amrit, Ougarit, Petra (Batra), Tyre and Sidon.The Bashar (Early humans) who lived during that era called the quarantined cityof these women Ur Shabha (The City of Mirage), and “Bourg or Ka’la Hasna Diaa”(The Bourg or Fortress of Beautiful Illusion,” since the most attractive womenfrom “Ardi” or “Ertzi” (Earth) lived there. And the quasi-humans who were madeout of “Turba” (Ashes, soil, earth) were not allowed to interact with thesewomen.Thousands of years later, the inhabitants of what is today the Arab Peninsulaand the lands bordering Persia, the United Arab Emirates, and India, calledthese women “Nisa’ Al Nour” or “B’nat Nour” (The Women of Light), and those whowere allowed to “mix with them” were called “Ba’niin Nour” (The Sons or Childrenof Light).From this early human race, all humans came to life. God had nothing to do withthe creation of your race.In other words, the God we know, revere, and fear today did not create us.Even the word or term “God” did not exist in those early stages of the existenceof the human race on Earth.Instead, the terms “Gods” or “Heavenly Masters” were used.And thousands of years later, those terms were changed to “Giants” (Amalika),“Elohim”, “Nephilim”, “Rephaim”, “Anakim”, and even “Fallen Angels”, so on. Each universe has its own god.Question: Do you believe in God?Alien: Which one?Question: Our God!Alien: Each Universe has its own god, which is the “Highest Essence”. God wasinvented by the early human beings.I have already answered this question so many times.You are wasting your time.And your intentions are very clear to me.No, I will not contradict myself.I remember everything I have said to you in the past.Question: Who created the universe? God?Alien: Itself. Your God had nothing to do with the creation of the universe.Question: Please explain.Alien: The Universe came to exist before time and space existed.Question: What do you mean?Alien: There is no beginning otherwise the Universe would need a creator.Question: Do you mean the Universe created itself?Alien: Not exactly.Question: Would you please clarify?Alien: You would never understand unless you get outside time and space, as didthe universe. (She meant this is how the universe came to exist from nothing).Question: How can I do that?Alien: In your situation and condition, you can’t.Question: Can you?Alien: Yes.Question: How come?Alien: Because I am not a physical entity.Question: Meaning what?Alien: I am not trapped or defined by religion, age, space, weight, or time.Possibly by memory if needed.Question: Memory? What kind of memory?Alien: The one that gives me a “Frame”; the one I use when I enter a physicaldimension.Question: I don’t understand.Alien: I already know that. Who is keeping the Universe in order?Archbishop: Well if you don’t believe in God then who is keeping the Universe inorder, keeping it running smoothly like a watch?Alien: This is a very wrong example because a watch needs to be re-wound fromtime to time. If you don’t rewind it, it will stop and you would not have thecorrect time.This means that what is behind the Universe is somebody who is re-winding itconstantly.And constantly does not mean hand, eyes and a long white beard. It is themulti-dimensional energy which keeps the Universe in order. A universal energyyou can’t see and you can’t understand now; this energy keeps the fabric of theUniverse in place, and attached to itself. It is a dark energy the human mindcan’t understand. Note: Years later, the aliens explained to us what they meant by the “universalenergy”, a “Dark Energy” that keeps the universe functioning properly and in asynchronized order, since we didn’t understand this concept in the 40’s.When the military once again met with the aliens in the early 70’s, the aliensexplained to us what they meant by the “energy of the Universe”; they called itthe Dark Matter or Dark Energy. *** *** *** On the Final Judgement, and reincarnation.Question by a bishop: Do you believe in the final judgment?Christians believe in a final judgment at the end of days.Alien: It happens every day.Question by an anthropologist: What do you mean?Alien: It happens as you speak.You are your own final judgment.Question by an ethicist: Do you believe in reincarnation?Alien: No. There is no reincarnation. However dead people trapped in the doomedzone (Marash Mawta) can re-appear and re-manifest themselves physically andholographically.Question: Do you believe in hell and heaven?Alien: You have already asked me this question.Don’t be repetitious. There is no hell and there is no heaven. *** *** *** What the aliens told us about Fikr (The mind) in the afterlife:Alien: The Fikr (The mind) as energy continues to exist via the molecularstructures of Fikr in the afterlife. And the etheric and/or astral substancesvary from one person to another, to name a few: * a-Astral * b-Etheric * c-Holographic * d-Mental * f-Plasmic * g-Ectoplasmic * h-Orbs * i-Imprints, so on. *** *** *** On the biblical flood:Archbishop: Do you have any record of the Flood which is mentioned in the Bible?Alien: A huge flood did occur in antiquity (Pre-Biblical time), but it was notglobal and did not cover the entire Earth. It was regional and it did decimatehabitats, villages and settlements, only in the Middle East. The Biblical storyof the Deluge is not correct. *** *** *** On hell, paradise, death and the human soul.Question: Do you believe in hell?Alien: No.Question asked by a bishop: Do you believe in heaven?The Christian Paradise?Alien: No.Question by a bishop: Do you mean there is no life after death andnowhere…nothing…no place to go to after death? Life ends on Earth?The soul is not immortal?Alien: There is no soul, only a mind.And the realm of mind is limitless and endless.The Soul, the human soul your kind believes in, is produced by a cell in yourbrain; a cell you did not discover yet.The brain’s cell is responsible for everything.Note: In a second meeting, the alien spoke once again about that particular cellin our brains, which is responsible for everything and anything that shapes,conditions, animates and produces our psyche, feelings, thoughts, organism, andintelligence,It is in that particular cell, that the so-called human soul exists, lives, andtransforms itself into other substances and dimensions during our life, and inthe afterlife.The alien added, it is the vibrational projection of the cells in the brain thatlasts after death and is retransformed into another form of energy. Because soulas we know it does not exist; it is an idea created by early human beings forreasons not worthy discussing. The Anunnaki Ulema said the very same thing.There is no soul trapped in the human body.This idea was created by the cave man even though he did not understand whatsoul is.It was his way to communicate with the “Divine” and the supernatural, and tocontinue to live after death.The Enlightened Masters and Anunnaki Ulema believe that humans have more thanone brain in one location, although it is invisible to the naked eye. And thisvery brain/mind is what we erroneously call “soul”. According to the “Book ofRamadosh”, the Enlightened Masters have a totally separate Mental Faculty (Mind,Fik’r) in their “Cellular Conduit”. Statement of modern scientists:Soul is not a spiritual substance. It is a by-product of the Mind; a neuronalprocess of the Mind, produced by a cell in the Brain. For many decades I wroteabout the concept of the Soul and its mechanism, based upon the Kira’at of theAnunnaki Ulema.And I tried to explain how the concept of soul was created by the caveman, ourancestors, and religious organizations. Later on in history, the idea or conceptof soul was conveniently exploited and used by priests of the antiquity (Andmodern times as well) to serve their interests.This idea/concept was an effective tool they used to their advantage, todominate the illiterate masses, and to scare the hell out of us, especially,when priests attach the soul to a final judgment and to an eternal punishment ina burning hell.Outrageously the church claims that all those who do not follow the teaching ofthe Holy Church and do not obey its bishops, their souls will suffer forever ina burning hell.How convenient and how easy it is to use, to manipulate, and to scare the massesand the feeble minds with “Soul Punishment” and “suffering in an eternal hell’sfire!!”Without hesitation and fear, I publicly stated that the soul as we think we knowit does not exist.Instead, there is a primordial energy of motion and thoughts, including feelingsand reactions, produced and emanated by a miniscule cell in our brain, yet to bediscovered by science.The Ulema call Soul “Fik’r” and is animated by a “Cellular Conduit”. The aliensand especially the Beings of Lights of Aldebaran who are millions of years aheadof us call soul “A brain’s cell responsible for everything and anything thathappens in our body and in our mind, separately and/or concurrently.” http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~yannis/favorites/Francis%20Crick.jpg[../images/00055.jpeg]Nobel Prize winner, and discoverer of DNA, Dr. FrancisCrick.He said: “There is no soul.”_________________________________ In the United States, around 2010, a group of highly advanced scientists innumerous areas defined the soul as a neuronal process of the Mind, produced by acell in the brain.And I was delighted to watch on the Science Channel (June 2011) in the UnitedStates, two eminent scientists talking about the brain’s cell where ourso-called soul is stored.They made it very clear to their audience that the soul as a spiritual substancedoes NOT exist; it is rather a by-product of the brain. I have said that somefifty years ago, and I have elaborated on the subject in numerous books I wroteon the Anunnaki, Ulema and the afterlife.Nobel Prize winner and the co-discoverer of our DNA, Dr. Francis Crick wrote:“The astonishing hypothesis is, that there is no soul. The soul is not more orless than the neural processes in our brain.” *** *** *** On human civilization and ethics.Question: Do you have a chronology of Earth?Alien: It is recorded.Question: Where?Alien: in the Miraya.Question: What is that?Alien: A cosmic monitor. A cosmic depository.Question: Where do we find this depository?Alien: You can’t. It is beyond your reach.Question: Who recorded Earth’s chronology?Alien: You did.Everything you did; your noise, your broadcast, your wars, your savagery, yourweapons, your violence.Question: We did?How could we, if the depository you talked about is beyond our reach?Alien: You could still look at some far distant objects or at a particulardestination in the universe, and you would not be able to reach, because of theenormous distances that separate them from you, but these objects anddestination will always be there, whether you reach them or not.You do not need to reach a destination or touch an object to make it exist. Lookat your moon. Did you touch it? Did you reach it?No. But it is there. Same thing for the depository.It is there like the Moon which you can’t reach, but in the future, you willland on the surface of the Moon, and you will begin to understand.Question: How would you define an advanced civilization?Alien: When you stop using power, aggression and threat to convince others, youwill be on your way to civilization. When you look toward the universe and other communities before you look atyourself, you will be on your way to build a civilization. When you get rid ofyour weapons, any tools of destruction, you will be on your way to civilization.When you stop to have locks on your doors and fear intrusions, you will be onyour way to civilization.When you unify one language for all the people of your kind to use, you will beon your way to civilization. When you stop to categorize people by gender, byrace and by colors, you will be on your way to civilization.When you are no longer in need of guardians (The alien meant police officers andlaw enforcements), judges, jails, and punishment, you will be on your way tocivilization.When you get rid of your monetary system, you will be on your way tocivilization. When you stop killing each other, and living creatures (animalsand creatures of the sea) and eating their flesh and drinking their blood, youwill be on your way to civilization.When you stop dropping your waste in the oceans and polluting your environments,you will be on your way to civilization. When you get rid of your threateningorganized religions you will be on your way to civilization.When you start to believe in the divine essence of yourself and the spiritualmental immortality of your very being, you will be on your way to civilization.But, we know you will never do any of this. Note: An anthropologist who was listening to the alien’s answer had tears in hiseyes. You would think that the attendees at the meeting would/could be motivatedand impressed by what the alien has said. Absolutely not. Instead, many of theattendees continued to hammer the alien with tricky questions. Question: Do you consider us an advanced civilization?Alien: No.Question: What it would take for a civilization to be considered civilized andadvanced?Alien: I have already answered this question.Question: How can we convince your people we are a peaceful nation?Alien: We already know your intentions. You can’t.You are not a peaceful nation.Q: How come you know so much about our life, customs, habits, science, andhistory and what we do on Earth?Alien: This is a very simple matter.Everything you do and you’ve done does not vanish. The substance of everythingyou have done, whether physical or mental takes on a new shape, a new form.Nothing in the universe comes to an end.Instead, it transforms itself into something else. If not, the universe willseize to expand and to exist.If each time, part of the universe, part of your Earth, part of the stars, partof the rocks, part of the air, part of the water vanishes and disappears, theuniverse will be missing a lot of things. And, if this continues endlessly, theuniverse will be empty. But emptiness does not exist in the universe, eventhough, a part of the universe is missing.There is no such thing as an empty space because if there is something like anempty space you will not be able to find it. And, to know where this empty spaceis, you have to know the limit of the empty space by comparing it to a fullspace.The fact that you are doing this means, you have given a size, shape, a spaceand a border to that empty space.This is a matter of mathematics and physics, according to your science. Soeverything you have done on your planet has been preserved.We can tap into the space and time of everything you have done. We areinterested in humanity and your progress.You have been broadcasting for some time now.And the frequencies of your programs and your music are well preserved.We knew about you, and also about other advanced societies in the universe; weknew about you from the very beginning.We did not contact you because you had nothing to offer us.And if you wonder why now we are suddenly interested in you and your planet, Icould give you lots of answers.Some of the members of the galactic community already lived on your planet. Manyleft, while others remained here.And with those who have remained here on your planet we share information andcommunicate via means and ways, your mind can’t imagine or understand.We enter and exit your sky (atmosphere) through time pockets. And this also issomething you are not capable of understanding, but in the future you will. *** *** *** On the creation of the human race, and the origin of Man and the earliest humanspecies:The alien said:1-At the dawn of your race, several human species had long tail. Do you thinkthey were created in the image of your God?2-An archaic human-reptilian race lived on your planet.3-Your modern species (Final form of human beings) were genetically created bythe Anunnaki.Your God did not create your kind. You were created by the stars, and those wholived on the stars.The Anunnaki created you as humanoid-robots to serve their needs, and you were“re-transformed” into humans following years of genetic manipulations.A genetic manipulation created your modern physiognomy, and stayed the very samefor the past 11,000 years. The early form of your kind (Humans) was created some65,000 years ago.4-Neither your theory of Evolution nor your theory of the Creation is correct.5-You are (The human race) not important to us.6-You (Human beings) can create other humans, you have the possibility…you don’tneed a God to do that. A world created by an evil god:According to the Gnostics, the world is not created by a good God but by an evilGod; the devil himself.The alien said, “Earth is where the lowest life-forms and species live.”(Note: The alien meant the human race.In other segments of the Aliens Transcripts, the alien stated, “Galacticcivilizations view Planet Earth as a dumpster.”The alien added, “Earth and its people were not created by an evil or a viciousgod, or by the devil himself, but by the universe itself.And, all those bad things which are happening today in your world (society), andhave occurred in the past, are caused by your genetic makeup.You were not created by what you call “God”, but rather by a multitude ofprocesses, and you were “upgraded” by a highly advanced alien race. Your final“product” and “shape” are shaped in their image. You should have said you werecreated in the image of those who created you, and not by what you call God.” Note: Maronite priest Father Hannah Saloum confirmed to me that the scrolls atAl Kaslik Monastery contained almost identical statements written in Aramaic(Syriac) and Arabic. *** *** *** Recreation of full-size specimens of early human and quasi-human species. In fact, military scientists and models makers attempted to forensicallyrecreate full-size specimens of early humans and quasi-human races-species basedsolely upon direct instructions and anatomical descriptions given to us by thealiens.The aliens told us that humans can create a brand new race of humans, and weshould not be very concerned with the “Idea” of a “Human Soul” or playing God,since neither soul nor God exists. Soul should be understood as energy, acellular “dynamo” rather than a divine creation of God. And God should bereferred to as a “Cosmic Power” instead of a divine/Biblical figure. In fact, military scientists, geneticists and models’ makers solicited the helpof the curator of a famous institution-museum in Washington, D.C., known for hisexpertise in the field of genetics and molecular biology; the curator candidlytold them that it couldn’t be done.Instead, he suggested that they should contact a noted Hollywood’sdirector-producer known for using fantastic special effects and robotics.The Hollywood’s man recommended a few artists who work at Walt Disney’s studio.The folks at Disney began to work on the project, which during its second phaseended up in the laboratory of one of the major universities in Israel.Anti-Semite whistleblowers in academia and the military complained, and rushedto conclude that it was a Jewish conspiracy!It is absolutely ridiculous!Finally, after 4 years of creative and pioneering work, some archaic humans andquasi-human forms (Mannequins) came to life, and an extensive cataloging processbegan.I hope, I do really hope that one day, the whole world will have access to thesemarvels. It is not going to be a pretty picture, but enlightening andeducational, to say the least.According to the Alien we met in 1948, and intraterrestrials’ accounts, some ofthe early humans, more correctly quasi-humans had a long tail, and co-habitedwith other reptilian races and Afarit in a large area in ancient Turkey.Some were captured by travelers from outer space.It was very clear from the Grays’ narrative description of the Anunnaki andtheir genetic programs, that they hated the Anunnaki and their offspring.This subject was not an interesting topic to military, but the anthropologistswho were present at the early meetings, convinced the military that suchinformation is priceless, because it could explain the origin of Man, and ourplace in the universe. So, the subject was kept wide open, and many questionswere asked. At one point during the discussion, the alien told us that a visitto Cappadocia in Turkey would be very useful, informative and convincing.The alien also suggested to the military to visit Derinkuyu and Gobekli Tepe.The generals were not impressed. *** *** *** The military men at the meeting got so bored.The military men, military scientists as well as government’s officialsrepresenting The White House and intelligence agencies at the meeting got sobored and even upset with the archbishop’s non-stop questions about ethics,morality, Christianity and religion; they didn’t come to the meeting to discussJesus, God, the Church and other religious matters.Their interests rotated exclusively around the nature of aliens, the purpose oftheir visits, where they came from, their spaceships, their technology, andultimately how to reverse engineer alien technology for the sole purpose ofusing it as a weapon system, and other closely related use and purposes.A general who was in charge of the meeting and proceedings told the archbishopto stop asking this kind of questions.The archbishop became agitated and furious, and insisted upon continuing to askthe alien about matters related to religion, God, Jesus and the Church.The archbishop was expelling like an old Ford T model, and kept on gripping alarge gold cross that he wore around his neck, and rubbing it with a feverishlyagitated motion, back and forth against his chest.Across the table sat a very famous evangelist, who thankfully kept a reservedcomposure during the entire meeting. *** *** *** Synopsis of what the aliens told us about Jesus.1-During his lifetime, Yashou or Imanuil (Jesus) was not an important figure,and was known to few in small and poor villages.2-Jesus was not a Jew. He was Phoenician.3-Jesus did not die on the cross. And after his crucifixion, he was rescued, andspent the rest of his life with his wife Myriam Magdala in Massilia in SouthernFrance.4-Jesus was a man and not God or the son of God.5-Jesus did not perform supernatural miracles, only extraordinary healing.6-The wedding of Jesus and Myriam Magdala took place in Cana, a small village inSouthern Phoenicia (Modern day Lebanon). One of the weirdest and unexpected things about what the aliens said to anarchbishop about Jesus Christ, and who was seated next to a famous scientistfrom Los Alamos laboratory at one of the early meetings with an alien was this:Jesus Christ did exist; he had wisdom but he put himself into lots of troubles,really unnecessary. He was not a dominant social figure. We have a true accountof his life that you should consider, and when we will meet again we’ll bringyou this account.”The alien added: “We have watched various episodes from your history and yourcivilizations on our “Cosmic Screen” (An extraordinary tool used to rewind timeand learn about past events.) None of the four Bibles written by the disciplesof your Jesus Christ was ever written by any disciple, for they were totallyilliterate, and could not write or read, or understand ancient Greek, Latin orany foreign language. Note: In fact, only scholars, historians and an elite of the ruling class, andhighly educated people (In and outside the Roman Empire) could read and speakGreek, Latin, and/or any foreign language.Worth mentioning here that Jesus spoke in Aramaic, and not in Hebrew. Hisdisciples who were illiterate and from the lowest social class spoke onlyAramaic. Only Judas was fluent in both Hebrew and Aramaic.Of course Jesus Christ knew both languages. He learned those languages at thePhoenician Temple of Melkart, in healing centers in Phoenicia and from theEssenes. When he argued with the rabbis he could have used any of the twolanguages. But his disciples could not.The Hebrew was spoken a few kilometers from where the disciples lived, and theydid not know a word in Hebrew. So, don’t expect the disciples to know and tounderstand Greek or Latin, languages which were spoken thousands of miles awayfrom their homeland.The alien added “The four Bibles are not authentic. And this is very sad for youbecause your people can’t distinguish between the real Jesus Christ and themythical one you have created. More than ¾ of your Bibles is incorrect,distorted, copied and recopied several times over, and each time new storieswere added, and old ones were deleted.That is why you see many contradictions in you Bible. Archbishop: Do you believe in Jesus Christ?Alien: Jesus Christ did exist. He was a man of wisdom.Archbishop: Was Jesus the son of God?Alien: You created the idea of God.Archbishop: How did we create the idea of God?Alien: God as you define it exists only on your planet. I have already explainedthis.Q: Do you believe in Jesus Christ’s resurrection?Alien: Resurrection?Archbishop: Yes, resurrection from death. Didn’t he die on the cross and comeback to life?Alien: None of your species can come back from death.Note: The registration of the alien’s answer on the screen was originally: “Yourkind dies.And none of your kind comes back from life’s termination (Meaning death).Archbishop: How do you know that?Alien: By rewinding time. You wouldn’t understand.Archbishop: What is rewinding time?Alien: You wouldn’t understand. The Gnostics:An archbishop asked the alien:Q: How about the other bibles written by the heretics?Note: He meant the Gnostics.Alien: Same thing, many stories were fabricated, but at least they got the mostimportant thing right.”Archbishop: What do you mean? What did they get right?Alien: Let me give you a few examples that you can easily understand.a-The Gnostics said, Jesus is not divine; he is not the son of God, and, theygot it right.b-They said that Jesus did not die on the cross, and, they got it right.c-The Gnostic said Jesus never came back from the dead, and they got it right. *** *** *** Jesus Christ according to the account of Anati.(on Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.) Regardless of whether you are going to believe or disbelief the account of AmbarAnati (A hybrid woman), or you are about to ridicule and mock this mostextraordinary account based upon time-travel and rewinding time, I remain veryconfident that the information and revelations contained in Anati’s account willcaptivate your mind.But before you read any part of Anati’s account, remind yourself of what quantumphysics’ contemporary scientists (Dr. Michio Kaku to name one), and the leadersof the parallel dimension and supersymmetry theories have said about themultiverse, and the “continuous existence” of people (Our Life) in otherdimensions.You will never believe the story of Anati unless and until you revisit theSupersymetry and multiple dimensions’ theories as advanced by said quantumphysics’ scientists. Anati in her own words:We, who live such short lives, make many historical mistakes, even when writtenrecords are available. Take, for instance, the issue of Jesus and thecrucifixion. I was raised a Presbyterian, and my parents took me quite often tochurch. It had become a habit, and I never questioned or even thought about theCrucifixion.Well, imagine my surprise when Sinhar Marduchk told me that Jesus did not die onthe cross! I hope I am not upsetting anyone, but the real story involves theexistence of two tombs. Apparently, it was planned. Jesus Christ was given a ragsoaked in vinegar and “Moukhadar” which caused deep anesthesia, and made himsleep.Later in the day he was indeed stabbed with a spear, but not fatally, and atsunset the soldiers assumed he was dead and took him down.His uncle Joseph of Arimatheawho had arranged the matter wrapped him with ashroud, and took him to a faraway cave (A second grave) to hide him and help himrecover, but then two persons hired by his uncle took the bloody shroud and leftit in the tomb everyone expected him to be in. He was never there, thus givingrise to the story of the resurrection.A few days later, Jesus was secretly taken to Phoenicia, where he partiallyrecovered.His uncle Joseph of Arimathea put Jesus and his wife on a Phoenician boat thatwent to Cyprus. Eventually, they fled to Marseille, France, where they settledpermanently and had children. Jesus worked in his profession, a handyman (henever really was a carpenter, this is a translation mistake), lived peacefully,and avoided all matters of religion for the rest of his life. His descendantslived in France, and some of them still exist.“Does that story bother you?” asked Sinhar Marduchk. “Not at all,” I said. “I amno longer a religious person, and I would much rather know the truth than livein ignorance.” Sinhar Marduchk smiled with appreciation. Apparently he liked tosee that I kept an open mind.I must tell how I was later rewarded by being taught how to time travel, andthus be able to meet Mary Magdalene and Jesus in person. My first time travel; how I met Jesus and Mary Magdalene – who turned out verydifferently than expected.It is impossible to describe my feelings regarding my expected visit with MaryMagdalene.I always had a deep interest in her and thought she must have been a mostcomplicated personality, and her place in history, next to Jesus himself, wasenough to make me revere her. The thought of seeing her was an emotionalwhirlwind, particularly since Sinhar Inannaschamra was quite sure that I will beable to meet Jesus as well. Having been brought up a Christian, it was difficultfor me to accept the possibility that Jesus not only did not die on the cross,but lived happily in Massilia (modern Marseille) with his wife and family. Iassumed I would have to use a cone to learn the language spoken in ancientGallia Narbonensis, the part of France where Massilia existed, prepare myclothing, and practice shape shifting, but it turned out I was wrong. All I hadto do, said Sinhar Inannaschamra, was to wear my Monitor around my neck, exactlythe way I wore it when I went to my mission at the military base, and use thesame code, so she could keep an eye on me. She was going to check on meperiodically, and if anything, went wrong, come and get me.But she expected everything to go smoothly, and as always, I trusted her. Shegave me exact directions as to what to do and how to behave, and indeed, itseemed so simple I could hardly believe it.“How do I get back?” I asked.“Very easy,” said Sinhar Inannaschamra. “Just speak the code to the Monitor. Itwill do the rest, you will hardly feel it.”Next morning I went to the Akashic Library, wearing normal clothes and carryingnothing other than the Monitor around my neck. I repeated the steps I took whenI met with the Council, only this time requested the Departures Room. The padtook me to an octagon-shaped glass pavilion that stood out of the main building,surrounded by ancient conifers. The glass was transparent, so I could see thatthe room was entirely empty, other than one stool in the middle of it.The room was not very big, and it had a glass door, also transparent. I entered,and to my amazement, I could not see anything outside, because the glass becameopaque.I had no idea at the time what caused it, since Sinhar Inannaschamra forgot totell me about it. Later, I found out that the air in the room has a specialquality that made the glass opaque.As instructed, I sat on the stool, and that started the action. One of thepanels opened up, and millions of charts with codes started to flicker on ascreen. At the same time, all the other panels turned black. The whole roomdarkened, and only the front panel, which showed the charts, had any light onit.At this moment, the screen seemed to release a plasma-like substance, and itcame toward me and circled my body. I began to spin around myself, feeling verydizzy and strangely heavy.I am not sure how long it lasted, but it seemed that in an instant I foundmyself in an ancient town by the sea. To me it seemed not much larger than afishing village, but this was only because I was not used to first century townsand had the prejudices of a modern person as to what a town should look like.This was Massilia, the Roman name for present day Marseille, a thriving, growingRoman trading port, and I knew it did well because it was the first town ofGallia Narbonensis to have a public sewer system.Actually, it was already an old town, since originally it was built by theGreeks and had archaeological remnants of the Greek settlement. But the Romanshad added quite a lot of buildings, streets, and roads since Julius Caesarconquered it.I knew what to expect, but the experience was nevertheless incredibly bizarre.Most people seem to think that time travel is simply going to the time and placeyou wish to visit, and entering it as if it were a normal place. This is not so.When time traveling, it is almost as if one travels in virtual reality, and theexperience has to build upon itself, to materialize. Therefore, the place wasentirely empty, with only a few fishermen standing at a distance on the shore.But they were not moving, they were like statues. The rest of the town wascompletely empty of people. I felt the town was alive, as if expecting somethingto happen, but no one was in sight.All of a sudden, people started to appear in the street, but they came fromnowhere, from the empty space in the air. Materializing one by one, they filledthe town; it felt as if I was meeting apparitions. Then, in a few minutes, Iadapted, and started experiencing real life in a real town. Everything becamenormal.I decided to take a short walk to just study the town a little. Massilia was abustling town.The houses were made of stone fixed with mud, low and sturdy, but a few houseswere truly elegant. Walking toward the opposite direction from the sea, Ientered the open market, full of little stores and workshops. Each workshop wasa small, rather dark room, that opened into the street with a large, opendoorway.You could see the craftsman working on the goods he hoped to sell, or themerchant surrounded by his goods.Most of the stores were devoted to foodstuffs, such as stores of neatly packagedspices, or one devoted to cheeses and pickles.But there were also some shops that sold fabrics and various notions needed forweaving, sewing, and embroidery. The market, with its noisy cries of themerchants, the interesting smells, and colorful sights, was extremely appealing.After enjoying strolling in the market, I turned back and walked to the shore.The whole place smelled like fresh fish, but it was not terribly unpleasantdespite my growing dislike for animal food. Those fishermen who were not at seawere mending nets, cleaning their catch, and doing other chores. Some littlefishing boats were turned upside down, being mended. The sun was shining, thelight Mediterranean breeze was blowing, and beautiful, big white shells werestrewn everywhere. I picked a little warm sand in my hand. Having been broughtup in Maine, I was very fond of the sea. The place felt like home and I felt atwinge of homesickness, remembering how my mother used to bring me to the shoreand help me collect shells and smooth sea glass and pebbles.I decided the time came to drag myself away from nostalgia and go visit MaryMagdalene, fully aware that I was postponing this very thing I wished to dobecause I was quite nervous about it. Resolutely, I turned away and went intothe town proper. Many women were carrying baskets on their way to the market,and to my relief, as I looked at myself, I was assured that I was wearing thesame clothes as any of the better dressed women who walked the streets. I had ona long woollen outfit, white with multicolor stripes on the sleeves and on thehem, soft leather sandals, and a thin silk scarf loosely covering my head.Obviously, I matched the upper class ladies, just as Sinhar Inannaschamra toldme I would. I took my Monitor, which was still hanging around my neck, andlooked at my face in the mirror that was part of the Monitor. I looked differentthan the usual, in a subtle way. The spinning that turns into shape shifting,really affects all the molecules in one’s body, even helps one fit into theclimate and environment one travels to.Sometimes one does look different for the duration of the trip. I looked alittle older, I thought. That was good, I would inspire confidence in MaryMagdalene as an older woman. I must say I liked the ornate silver earrings I waswearing, just showing under the white silk scarf.The only thing left was to rehearse the language. At the moment of arrival, Idid not know the language, but all it took was hearing one or two words spokenon the street.This is because the spinning opens up the Conduit “Mind’s Cellular Conduit”, andtriggers the part of the knowledge depot which is the seat of all languages.As soon as I heard those words, I knew the language as if I had spoken it all mylife. I rehearsed a few words, just in case, and felt comfortable. But I wasdetermined to speak to Mary Magdalene in Aramaic, her own language.I looked at the Monitor, got directions to Mary Magdalene’s house, and strolledthere, still enjoying the sights and sounds of the busy town. I did not have farto go to the small, neat house, well maintained, and standing in a little gardenplanted with herbs and flowers. Like all the other houses, it was made of stoneand mud, and two stories high.I stood on the other side of the street, wondering how to approach MaryMagdalene. I was so excited about the meeting, that I did not think about whatlines to use to persuade her to talk to me. But everything worked out very well.As luck would have it, I saw a woman approaching the house, carrying a basket.One look and I knew it was Mary Magdalene, because Sinhar Inannaschamra showedher to me on the monitor. She was not beautiful, exactly, but nevertheless wasextremely attractive. She must have been in her late thirties, small and slightbut with an elegant figure, and she carried herself with poise and dignity.She had lovely, warm brown eyes, and dark chestnut hair slightly touched withwhite at the temple, which I could see because her scarf was sitting way back onher head. She was simply and neatly dressed in an outfit very much like mine.I approached her, and greeted her in Aramaic, introducing myself. She seemedextremely surprised and delighted. “Are you from Judea?” she asked in a verypleasant voice.“No, I am Phoenician,” I said. A half-truth, but I really could not do anybetter.“It is nice to hear you speak Aramaic,” she said.“My husband and I speak it at home, and taught it to the children, but most ofour friends here do not know it. Won’t you come in and rest, and have somerefreshments? And tell me what is it that you wished to speak to me about?”I accepted with pleasure, and we entered the living room, a simply furnished butvery clean and pleasant place. She went to place her basket elsewhere, probablya separate little room devoted to cooking, thus giving me time to observe theroom carefully. This was clearly the house of a middle class family.It had many comforts and conveniences, though certainly not ostentation or overtluxury.The walls were neatly plastered and whitewashed, the floor was tiled, and thewindows had a lattice structure that provided security and decoration at thesame time. There were three or four niches in the walls, each containing an oillamp. This family obviously did not go to bed with the sun, as poor people wereforced to do; the lamps spoke of reading and writing and spending time withfamily and friends after the sun had set. A few small rugs covered the floor.The room was very adequately furnished with a large table with two benches, eachwith a few colorful, embroidered pillows on it, storage boxes made frombeautiful dark wood, and a built-in stone pallet, with a throw and pillowsproviding comfortable sitting.Here and there, on the rugs, there were also large cassock-like pillows coveredwith beautiful fabrics.A couple of copper braziers stood by the wall, awaiting the season of winter andglowing softly. In a corner stood another large table, covered with manuscripts,including one that was currently worked on, writing implements, and inks. Thewhole room was scented by a big bunch of cut herbs and flowers in a clay jarthat stood on the dining table.Mary Magdalene came back with cold water, wine, cakes, dried figs, and honey.“As you might know, the Romans decided to make a law here that women cannotdrink wine when a man is not around, but we don’t pay much attention to it… theydon’t really follow you into the privacy of your home, I must say.” She pouredme a glass of wine. The wine was delicious, and she pressed some of the food onme.“I noticed that your beautiful throw on the couch is white and striped withblue,” I said.“These are our colors in Phoenicia, the symbolic colors of the god Melkart.”“Well, there is little difference between our nations, and white and blue areour colors as well. I knitted this throw, thinking all the time of Judea…” saidMary Magdalene. “Our nations are related, you know.Not only through the marriage of King Solomon and King Hiram’s daughter, buteven before. I like to hear Yeshua tell me, and the children, about the historyof our people.And he told us that many people believe that Joshua, the one that helped Mosesduring the Exodus, really was a Phoenician Prince. As a matter of fact, heentered Canaan independently, from the north, and settled peacefully. He nevereven knew Moses, they say.”“I had no idea,” I said, making a mental note that this would be a subject worthpursuing at the Akashic Library on my next visit there. “This is fascinating. Ireally must look into it. I like history too, you know, very much.”“You must visit us often, then, and discuss this matters with Yeshua. He will behappy to meet another enthusiast of his favorite subject.”“I would love that… I promise I will come back, if you will let me. But I mightas well tell you what I came to ask you, before I go on enjoying yourhospitality,” I said, a little guiltily. “You may be angry with me, since I amabout to rake up your husband’s past.”“I am rarely angry,” said Mary Magdalene.“And I don’t really mind talking about the past, as long as it is with anotherwoman. I am still afraid of men, though. I always feel we are forever in danger.I constantly warn my husband to stay out of trouble.Now that he is older, he listens better. Yeshua is a very nice, kind man, and hedoes listen to me when I advise him on many matters, but sometimes I wonder ifhe understands that we should be careful for as long as we live.He is very intelligent, and extremely well-educated, but between you and me, hehas absolutely no common sense.”“I know little about your husband, only that he was falsely arrested by theRomans and you had to leave Judea.”“Indeed, that is the truth. I always knew we would get in trouble,” said MaryMagdalene, her smile disappearing.“As I said before, and I mean it, Yeshua just did not have any sense whatsoever.He was a healer, and he had great success in curing many people.Unfortunately, he was also a bit of a magician, and instead of keeping histalents to himself, he would go and perform his healings and miracles in frontof important people. They hated him.”“But they could not object to his healings?” I asked.“Nothing is wrong with making people feel better.”“Even healing can seem to be blasphemy, particularly if you also do magicaltricks as part of your performance. There was even foolish talk about his makingthe dead rise – of course this was sheer nonsense. The person that ‘rose’ fromthe dead, his name was Lazarus, a relative, simply fainted and Yeshua made himfeel better – but such stupid talk would cause trouble.Yeshua never even heard of the story – he was away with his friends the Esseneswhen it circulated, and I kept it from him when he came back; no point in givinghim ideas... But his talents of healing got him a bunch of followers, disciplesof sort, and they were good for nothing.All they wanted was magic and sensational tricks, and they went about sayingblasphemous things about Yeshua being the Messiah. Naturally, the Sanhedrin,once they heard the word Messiah, took a dislike to him.”“They would be sensitive about it, I suppose,” I said.“The Messiah is an important issue with your religion.”“Well, yes, and I must admit Yeshua was quite annoying,” said Mary Magdalene,smiling somewhat indulgently at the memory.“The business of having disciples made him think himself of more importance thanwas good for him. He insisted on preaching, and told people he was the Son ofGod. Now, that was a common thing to say if you knew the Essenes, a group ofdesert recluses he once lived with and kept on visiting; actually he spent quitea long time with them, enough to get him to believe in much of their doctrines.They call every honest person ‘Son of God.’But the authorities did not like it. Again, it sounded to them like blasphemy.The Sanhedrin members were very set in their ways, except for one man, Joseph ofArimathea.That is because Joseph was an Essene, too, and the uncle of Yeshua.No one knew it, he kept it a secret, since belonging to a sect would havespoiled his business and his reputation, but he never gave up the connection.And of course there was Nicodemus, his young protégé. He was also an Essene.Joseph and Nicodemus were real friends to us. I don’t know what we would havedone without Joseph, he really handled everything when the trouble began.”“And Yeshua was tried before the Sanhedrin, right?”“Not right away.First, he was arrested and taken to an interview with the Procurator.”“Am I right that this was Pontius Pilate?” I asked.“Yes,” said Mary Magdalene. “That was him. Do you know he was replaced a fewyears later?”“No, I had no idea. Why was he replaced?”“He was accused of some crimes, which of course he did not commit. He simplyfell out of favor. Joseph told us on one of his visits to Massilia, since he wasvery much surprised when the replacement happened. The Romans are sometimes verycruel; it is possible, though we are not sure, that they forced him to commitsuicide. Anyway, Pontius Pilate was not terribly interested in Yeshua… it seemshe even wanted to acquit him.We know a little because his bodyguard, a Roman centurion, heard everything thatwas said when Pilate spoke to the representative of the Sanhedrin, and laterwrote it all down.That is because he knew Yeshua, who once cured his daughter from a terribleillness. He really saved her life, and from a distance, too. Yeshua never sawthe child; he was good at such things. The Roman centurion was very grateful toYeshua, and thought it would help if he took these notes for posterity. Iimagine he knew that between the Romans and the Sanhedrin, they would executeYeshua. But there was more to it than just this interview.As I said, Pontius Pilate probably would have let Yeshua go free, because hecould not care less about religious matters, which were the chief complaints ofthe Sanhedrin. Rather, Pilate asked him if he had any designs against Caesar,and Yeshua answered that of course not, he had no problem with Caesar at all, heknew Caesar ruled Judea legally. So Pilate asked him if he would admit to Caesarbeing the strongest god, which was the standard thing to ask, and that wasYeshua’s downfall.I would have advised him to admit Caesar’s superiority, since it was a privateinterview and none of his friends was there to hear it.But Yeshua could not bring himself to blaspheme against God. The fool, all hehad to do was just nod his head… and what is more, he went very far in hisprotestations about Caesar. He told Pilate that he, Yeshua, was more powerfulthan Caesar because there was only one God, and he was the son of God. Again,more Essene nonsense. Naturally, after that, Pilate simply had to turn him overto the Sanhedrin, he had no choice. Someone, years later, was circulating therumour that Pontius Pilate never forgot Yeshua. Apparently, he was quiteinterested in his capacity as a healer, and even intended to send him toCaesarea, to be his own healer, since he had some illnesses. Ah, well.Sometimes, the Sanhedrin can be more cruel than the Romans.”“And what happened then?”“A huge, famous trial took place. The high priest, Caiaphas, was after Yeshua’sblood. He was a Sadducee, you know, one of the rich, higher classes. He feltthat Yeshua was a threat to the usual order of rich and poor, high and low… youknow, a rebel. Caiaphas was a really nasty man, eager for power. And he hadpower, lots of it…Our friend, Joseph of Arimathea, did a brilliant job ofdefending Yeshua, and it would have gone well, but for once Joseph made ahorrible mistake.He questioned him, ‘Do you consider yourself the Messiah?’ and Yeshua deniedthat in the most sensible manner; after all, Yeshua never thought of himself asthe Messiah! Never came into his head to imagine that! Then, Joseph asked thequestion that destroyed everything. He said, ‘Who are you, then, Yeshua?’ andYeshua was stupid enough to say, ‘I am the Son of God.’I know, I know, he should have known better, but he was very foolish at thattime. That gave the Sanhedrin the excuse to send him to the crucifixion.Caiaphas practically jumped with joy when he heard Yeshua say this thing.Horrible, horrible man, Caiaphas. I will hate him as long as I live, and believeme, I am not quick to hate.”“So he really was crucified,” I said, sadly.“Yes, Yeshua was crucified. I cannot tell you how cruel, how horrible, thispractice is. He suffered so much, blood all over his body. I was with hismother, and one of his disciples, but nobody else. All the other disciples ranaway, they were scared to death, fearing they would be arrested by theSanhedrin. It broke my heart that these people, who always claimed to loveYeshua so much, were not there for him as he was dying. A few people gatheredaround, probably just curious people, and they stood near the cross, but notvery close, because the Roman soldiers did not allow them to do so. His poormother collapsed twice in my arms.”“His mother, Mary of Nazareth… Yes, please tell me, what was Mary like?”“Mary… I miss her so much. She was very kind, always so sweet. I loved her verymuch, she never said an unkind word to me. And she had every reason to be mad atme, because I broke God’s law and lived with Yeshua before we were legallymarried, I am ashamed to say…”“But you always meant to be married, so it does not signify,” I said.“Oh, indeed, we always meant to be married.It was just because of all these delays and troubles, and things sometimes justhappen when you are young…Still, many other women would have held it against me.But not Mary. She was too kind.”“What did she look like?”“She was incredibly beautiful,” said Mary Magdalene, her eyes misty with thememory. “I have never seen anyone as beautiful as Mary. She was only fourteenwhen Yeshua was born, so she was still young when the trouble happened. She hadvery long black hair, which she always put in one long braid.Her skin was white, like the finest ivory, and she had big, clear blue eyes,rather unusual for our people. She always wore a lot of blue, she was a littlevain about her eyes and about her great beauty, but not in an unpleasant way,and who could blame her…My daughter Sarah inherited these amazing eyes, everytime I look at her I think of Mary…” She wiped a tear.“Do you know, Mary’s hair began to gray very quickly after Yeshua’s crucifixion.It only took a couple of months before it was all silvery white; it must havebeen the agony she went through, seeing her son undergo such pain. But even withthe silver hair she looked young and beautiful. Perhaps even more beautiful.There was something so delicate, so soulful about Mary.”“So the two of you stayed by Yeshua’s side. It must have been heart-breaking.”“We just stood there, crying and helpless.The men on the two crosses on Yeshua’s sides fainted, off and on, like Yeshua.Then, Nicodemus came and asked the Roman soldier, who was guarding this row ofcrucifixes, if he can wipe the face of Yeshua, and give him something to drinkfrom a sponge.The soldier said ‘Yes, go ahead,’ so Nicodemus dipped the sponge in a bucket andbrought it to Yeshua’s mouth. I saw him sipping from the sponge, and blood keptpouring and pouring from his hands and his feet. A few moments later, it wasclear that he passed away; Mary fainted and fell to the floor. As for me, I feltthis was not happening, as if it was a nightmare, and I was expecting to wakeup. As if in a dream, I approached the Roman soldier and asked him if I couldtake Yeshua home for burial. I simply could not bear to leave him there on thecross. But he said that this was against the rules.I asked him, ‘What are you going to do with his body? He is dead, after all.’The soldier told me that the law requires that all crucified people first bechecked to see if they were really dead, because sometimes it takes them two orthree days to die. And after that, the Romans would take them and dump them in aplace reserved for crucified people and other condemned dead prisoners.”“This is disgraceful,” I said“Yes, it was very hard. But we were helpless. What could two women do againstthe Roman soldiers?So we left, and returned to the house, where we kept crying all of the lateafternoon and evening.Suddenly the door opened, and Joseph of Arimathea came in. He looked hurried andupset. ‘I have some news for you,’ he said. ‘I went to Pontius Pilate and Iasked him for a favor. I know Pilate through business, so they let me in.I asked him if I could take Yeshua’s body to be buried in my own family grave.Pilate said ‘Fine, go ahead.’To tell you the truth, I don’t think Pilate cared one bit about anyone in Judea.He was so bored with us and all he wanted was to get out of this nasty job.”“So Joseph got the body? What did he do with it?” I asked.“I can repeat the exact conversation, I remember it like yesterday,” said MaryMagdalene. “Joseph said, ‘this is a great secret, which you cannot tell anyone,especially Simon and Peter and the rest of the disciples.’”“I will say nothing,” I said to him. “Just tell me what you have done.”“I had to do something very quickly so no one will find his body,” said Joseph.“I got Nicodemus, and we took Yeshua right away to the grave of my family,making sure everyone saw that. Then I put some of his clothes there, arrangingthem so that they would look as if they contained the body, but we only stayedthere for a few minutes.”“Clothes? But what did you do with the body?” I asked him, perplexed.“As soon as we were alone, Nicodemus and I transferred Yeshua to another place,which for the moment must remain secret. We rushed to do it as fast as possible,which was extremely lucky, because as soon as I came back to my family grave Isaw Roman centurions marching toward it. I asked the Romans what did they comefor, and one of them told me that they got an order to guard the tomb, and theymust seal it first. I did not want to ask them who gave the orders, but Isuspect it was some of my friends at the Sanhedrin…The Romans helped me to rollthe big stone that usually sealed the grave. I felt so relieved, since I knew noone will get in anymore, and no one will ever know that Yeshua was not there.”“I don’t understand anything, Joseph,” I said. “Why did you have to go throughall that? Why not simply bury Yeshua properly?”“Just wait, Mary,” he said. “I find it very hard to explain. I went yourrelative, Elizabeth, and told her what I did. She said that she would like to goand anoint the body in preparation for the burial. So I told her, ‘You don’tneed to do that.’ ‘What do you mean?’ she said. ‘This is out tradition!’ So Itold her the truth. ‘Yeshua is not going to be buried. He is going to be allright.’ She thought I was crazy, probably you think I am crazy too.”I interrupted him, and I asked, “Are you mad? Are you trying to tell me thatYeshua is alive? How can that be? I saw him die on the cross, right afterNicodemus washed his face and let him sip some water. Did you witness a miracle?Is Yeshua really the son of God?”“It was not a miracle, Mary, but the water were not plain water, either,” hesaid. “I know something about herbs, from my days with the Essenes.I put a very strong herbal concoction in the water, one that creates adeath-like state that would last a few hours.And with the blood that Yeshua lost, and his weakened condition, he will be likedead for at least a night, but then he will wake up.”My mother-in-law heard all that in total silence, in complete shock. Sheobviously could not accept the good news so soon after the horrible ordeal. Butthen she said, “I must go to him, right away. I have to help my child, whetherhe is dead or alive.”“You cannot do so, my dear,” said Joseph gently.“If you don’t stay at home, and receive your friends and neighbors’ condolences,the Romans will suspect something. Tomorrow morning, very early, Elizabeth andMary Magdalene will come to see him. But you must be brave and stay here andpretend that Yeshua is dead and buried. It is essential if we are to save hislife.”And this is exactly what we did. We stayed all night. The next day, Mary stayedhome, but Joseph came and led me to a cave, quite a distance from our village.Nicodemus was guarding the entrance, and moved to let us in. Yeshua was lying ona large stone, which was covered with some soft blankets. He was exhausted andcould not talk at all, but he was alive! Joseph saved him! I immediately sawthat Joseph thought of everything. There was a bowl of grapes and olives byYeshua’s side, and some flat bread, and a jar of water. And Joseph brought cleanclothes for Yeshua. We treated his wounds as best we could, cleaned him, anddressed him with the fresh clothes. He felt better and could mumble a few wordsof thanks, but he was not entirely conscious.“What will happen now, Joseph?” I asked.“We are going to take Yeshua away, to the house of two fishermen I regularly dobusiness with. They are very loyal to me, and one of them is from Tyre, whichwill ease our escape.” We went there, a rather long journey, Joseph andNicodemus carrying Yeshua on a large board which they covered with the blankets.The fishermen were waiting for us. They were really very scared, but they weretrustworthy and kept their word. We took Yeshua inside the house, and there weretwo women there, one of them a Phoenician woman who rushed to help us, and tookYeshua to a small room where he could rest. We spent a short time with himinside the room, while the two other men were guarding the house.“Mary,” said Joseph, “Yeshua must leave Judea right away. He is in grave dangerhere.”“That is fine,” I said. “I have some money, perhaps we should hire a boat?”“Do not concern yourself with that,” said Joseph very kindly. “Everything hasbeen taken care of. You stay right here, look after Yeshua, and I will go andtalk to his mother and his brothers.” The next day Yeshua’s brother James came, with his mother; the other brothersand sisters did not believe what Joseph told them. But Mary and James came, andthey could not believe their eyes. James behaved rather strangely, he toldJoseph, ‘What kind of trick was that? This is not my brother!’ So Yeshua lookedat him and told him, ‘Do you remember the cut I had on the upper side of my leftshoulder?’ I knew he had the cut. So James, said, ‘Yes, let me see.’ And Yeshuashowed him the cut, and James fainted. Joseph told us that by tomorrow at thelatest, we would go to Tyre for a few days, then get a bigger ship and go theIsland of Arwad. He had friends there, business associates, dealing with theolives and olive oil business.I went to Arwad with Yeshua, Nicodemus, and Joseph, while Mary and James wentback home to Judea.Joseph told Mary that within a week, or ten days, I don’t remember exactly, hewould come back to Judea and take her with him to see us somewhere else. He didnot tell her where we would be, just in case if she would be questioned. SoMary, James, and the other brothers and sisters stayed in Judea. We spent threedays in Arwad, a beautiful small island. Many Phoenicians were there, of coursespeaking fluent Aramaic, so we could mingle with the crowd and nobody knew whowe were. Nevertheless, we mostly stayed inside the house Joseph rented for us.We did not feel safe.Then one afternoon, Yeshua was amusing himself doing one of his old tricks. Hewas trying to lift himself up in the air, attempting to fly, or float. He didmanage to float a little bit. He used to do a lot of tricks like that. While wewere enjoying his attempts, Joseph returned from an errand, and told us thattomorrow we were going to Cyprus, since Arwad was not really safe.Unfortunately, I started to feel extremely tired, and I suspected I waspregnant, but nobody knew; I did not want to worry either Yeshua or Joseph,particularly since we were not married yet. We were planning on getting married,as we discussed before, but so many things happened to prevent it. However, now,there was not time to lose; we had to be married before the child was born.But first, we had to get to Cyprus. So when we arrived, a few days later, thevery first thing we did was to get married, and I felt so much the better forit. Joseph again rented a house for us, and then he and Nicodemus returned toJudea. Actually, his plan was to bring Mary to us. He was uneasy about hersafety there, and so were we. One month later, he indeed brought her to Cyprus,and I was so happy to see her and tell her about our marriage and the comingchild.Joseph stayed a very short time, and then returned again to Judea. He warned usto stay put and wait until we hear from him before we did anything. And so welived quietly, and Yeshua regained his strength, but he was limping, and couldnot walk straight without leaning on me as he walked. I realized that his fullhealing will take some time, but I was very happy in Cyprus, away from thetrouble in Judea.After another month, Joseph returned.I asked him, in confidence, about the disciples. He told me to forget them,never count on any of them. They were cowards. Only Peter showed some regret,and visited Joseph once in a while. The others just went on with their lives. Iam sorry to say that Yeshua’s brothers and sisters also avoided him, pretendingthey did not know he was alive. Fear would do such things to people.Eventually I gave birth to my eldest daughter, Sarah. We stayed in Cyprus untilSarah was three years old, and in the meantime Yeshua found jobs here and there.Everybody liked him, but he lived very quietly and did not go out much. Mostimportant, I insisted that he should not make trouble, or start preaching. Nomore stories or sermons. The truth is, he did not want to do so anyway. I thinkhe had enough of sermons, disciples, and preaching.Of course, he could no longer do physical work, so there was no carpentry orhandyman jobs for him, which made him a little sad because he liked physicallabor. But he put to use his considerable knowledge of languages, and became ascribe.Once every five or six months, Joseph came to see us. Life was pleasant enough,but Mary never quite recovered from the ordeal of the crucifixion. She was sodelicate, and the ordeal broke her health for good. Eventually she became veryill, and even though we tried everything to cure her, she died rather suddenly.We buried her in Cyprus, but years later, Joseph took her body back to Judea forher final resting place, next to her husband, who was also called Joseph and whoI have never known, to my sorrow, since he died before I met Yeshua. I stillmiss my dear Mary. Following Joseph’s advice, we decided to go to GalliaNarbonensis, which had a few large Jewish communities. We planned to settle inMassilia.Joseph went with us, and also an Ethiopian maid we had in Cyprus, a seventeenyears old girl that Joseph brought us for help. She loved us and did not want topart from us.Later, in Massilia, she married a very nice young man, had a family, and westill visit each other. On the way, I asked Joseph why he took so much troubleto help us.“You went beyond friendship, even beyond family requirement, Joseph,” I said tohim with gratitude. “Why are you so kind to us?”Joseph was quiet for a short time, thinking, musing. “I love you like my ownfamily,” he said to me, his honest black eyes looking earnestly into mine. “Butit is more than that. I have caused Yeshua, his mother, and you, all thesuffering that you have undergone. I will never forgive myself, and forever Iwill have to atone for my sin.”“You? Caused us suffering?” I asked, incredulously.“Don’t you remember?” he said. “I was the one who asked Yeshua the fatalquestion during the trial. If I had not asked him who he was, they would haveset him free.”I had to cry. “No, Joseph, it was not you.Certainly, the question was misjudged. But the Sanhedrin would have tried tokill Yeshua no matter what. Please, please, don’t think about it anymore.” Wenever discussed it again, but I don’t think I had any luck in changing his mind,the poor, good man that he was.Joseph, of course, knew many people in Massilia, since he had much business withthem. He took us to a small shop owned by a Jewish friend, who had rented ahouse for us and got it ready. I loved our house from the first day, it feltlike home, even the smell of the house was a little like the houses in Judea,for some reason, possibly because we always lived in fishing villages, andMassilia was a fishing town. For the first time I felt really safe, far fromeveryone, Caiaphas in particular.You see, until we came here, I was always afraid Caiaphas will somehow hearabout us. He had his spies everywhere. But Gallia Narbonensis was far enoughfrom Judea, and only business people, like Joseph, would have much to do withit.Yeshua, too, began to get used to the place, and consorted with Jews only, sincewe thought they were the safest. He got a job as a scribe. He kept on surprisingme. In Cyprus, I saw him writing Greek. I told him I never knew he spoke Greek,and he laughed and said, ‘I speak all the languages.’ ‘I asked him, where didyou learn it?’ He said, ‘I learned it in Qumran, from the Essenes’. So here hedeveloped more skills. He brushed up on his Latin, and started to learn Gaelic,he was so good with languages, so now with Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Latin, andGaelic, business was okay, and life became comfortable. We had two morechildren, a boy and a girl. The boy is called Joseph, after Yeshua’s father. Youcan’t say he is named also after Joseph of Arimathea, since we are not allowedto call babies after living people. The girl is called Rachel. And you know oureldest is Sarah. They are all good children, I am happy to say.” Mary Magdalene suddenly stopped talking, and I saw she was smiling at someonebehind me. I turned my head, and saw a man entering the room.“this is my husband, Yeshua.Yeshua, this is a new friend, she came all the way to hear your story.”We greeted each other. It was hard to believe that I was looking, meeting,talking with Jesus Christ. This pleasant, ordinary, normal man?Could it be?He was not at all what I expected. He did not have fair long hair, he did notpossess an ascetic, pale face, or an emaciated body. Instead, Yeshua had frizzydark hair, a little curly on the back. He had dark skin, black eyes, and wasstrongly built, stocky, and not very tall, probably five eight or nine; youcould say he was a little plump, though certainly not fat, Just comfortablelooking.He wore sandals, a blue gray outfit, and carried two bags. One was a leatherbook bag, and the other a basket full of eggs and dry fruits. Jesus Christ,shopping at market? And yet, it had to be him, Jesus of Nazareth, JesusChrist... There could be no one else with a history so similar.I lost my head and I asked him, “Are you the One?”Fortunately, he did not understand what I meant. He smiled and said, “I amsorry, what did you say?” Stupidly, I asked him again, “Are you the Messiah?”He laughed like a child, and said, “Don’t bring up old stories and memories, allthis is well behind me…” Well, at least I did not kneel before him. That wouldhave not gone too well. So I recovered myself and smiled at him, just as if hewere a normal new acquaintance.“Let me make some supper,” said Mary Magdalene. “Please stay and eat with us.You will also like to meet the children, I am sure.”“I am sorry, Mary. I really must go, I have to meet someone and go home.”“May I take you where you need to go?” Yeshua asked helpfully.“No, really, there is no need. I am meeting them by the shore, just a fewsteps.”“If there is any trouble, though, and they don’t arrive on time, come rightback, won’t you?” said Mary Magdalene.“I will. And with your permission, I would like to visit again, and meet thechildren.”“I am counting on it,” said Mary Magdalene. We parted cordially, and I left. Iwas going to the shore, where I could be hidden from sight as I planned to givethe code and go back through my Monitor. As I was turning around the house, slowly, thinking about this wonderfulexperience, I was passing the window and heard Yeshua’s voice. I stood for amoment, listening. I did not mean to eavesdrop, it was just that it was hard forme to part from these two wonderful people who meant so much to me, and I justlingered.“Wait one minute, Mary, before you go to make the supper,” Yeshua said. “I havesomething really interesting to tell you, which I want to do before the childrencome. I don’t want them to hear it. It is downright amazing… there is a Greekman out there in the public plaza, he is doing what I used to do… but he is muchsmarter than me. He was preaching about God, and of all things, who do you thinkhe was also talking about, to a dozen of people? Me! was talking about me!”There was a short silence.Then I heard Mary Magdalene say, her voice full of anxiety, even terror.“Yeshua, did you get in trouble? Did you do something stupid?”“No, no, I did nothing dangerous. I just asked the fishermen, ‘Who is this man?’They said he was a Roman, or a Greek, and his name is Paul, or Saul, orsomething like that… he came from Judea. They said he personally knew a demigod,Jesus, something like that… Well, I had to talk to him, because I know thelanguage, and Jesus is a version of my own name. I was terribly curious.”“You talked to him? He could have gotten you arrested!” cried Mary Magdalene,aghast.“He is much more likely to be arrested himself, my dear. He is talkingblasphemy, while I am just the respectable scribe everyone knows around here… Itook him aside and we talked for a short time. I said to him that I think it wasI he was talking about…my name is Yeshua. He looked at me, and his eyes were shifty, mean, and shrewd. I usually likepeople, as you know, but I did not like this man. He said, ‘Maybe you are, maybeyou are not, my man. I really don’t care either way, because you don’t count.I have come with a new religion, I have brought the Messiah. Don’t interferewith me – I plan to have a following all over the world.’ Now, when he mentionedthe word Messiah, I just had to laugh, and so I slapped him on the shoulder andleft him alone to continue with his business.” “So did he go back to hispreaching?” asked Mary Magdalene. Her voice, I was pleased to tell, was not sostrained anymore.“Yes, he went right back to his preaching,” said Yeshua, his voice full oflaughter. “I stood at a little distance and listened to him as he talked on andon. Do you know what he said? He was telling everyone that I died on the cross,and then I rose from the dead and came back to life!Even I, in my best days as a magician, could have never invented such nonsense.Rose from the dead!Can you believe it?” *** *** *** The Prophet Mohammad:Anbar Anati said, “Also, another major revelation about other great religionssuch as Islam, Sinhar Marduchk told me that the Koran, the holy book I reallyadmire and respect, did not descend on Muhammad from Heaven, but he learned itfrom a Christian ascetic monk in the desert.This monk was known in the area as “Raheb Bouhayrah” meaning, priest, or monk,of the lake.

In addition to the Aliens Transcripts of 1948 and 1949,another alien race from Aldebaran conveyed messages to the German medium MariaOrsic. These messages are known as the “Aldebaran’s Messages”. Trance medium Maria Orsic.First of all, who is Maria Orsic?Secondly, what kind of link there is between aliens, the spiritual andmetaphysical aspects of the “Beings of Lights” from Aldebaran, and Maria Orsic?Maria Orsic is the mystic medium and creator of Earth’s first UFO’s (Vril) whosaid, “Organized religions will become frail relics of the past. And as scienceand technology advance, people of Earth will meet super beings from othergalaxies. And they will learn great things. And they will discover their truenature. And religions built upon power will vanish.The beings of light will return to Earth before or in 2022.Major changes will occur on many levels. But the nature of humans will notchange completely.Earth will be visited by beings from different worlds who are willing to advanceour standards of living everywhere on Earth, and reveal to us a new source ofenergy.But unfortunately, only an elite which is ruling the world will benefit fromtheir technology because people in power will keep it secret, and forthemselves.The beings of lights from Aldebaran told me how sad they are, and howdisappointed they are by the Anunnaki for not creating us a better human race. [../images/00057.jpeg]  Maria Orsic__________________________________ She added, “Stay away from organized religions, if you want to learn the truthand walk into the light.”Orsic continued, “I am not afraid to go to Aldebaran, Jamara (Name of a planetrotating in their constellation) and Nimra (Another planet), for they (Beings oflight)) told me that everything is going to be fine. Heike (A member of the VrilSociety created by Maria Orsic) was concerned because we did not know theirlanguage and we were not familiar with their way of life and their habits. Butthey assured me once that we are there (On Aldebaran), they will re-constructour minds and bodies, and we will readjust ourselves…we will be very happy, andwe will never suffer again or get sick.Their world is peaceful and beautiful. They will teach me many new things and Iwill learn about the greatest secrets of the universe…I will have access totheir universal libraries which contains the Akashic records of the universe…”Maria Orsic shared her vast knowledge of and interests in the supernatural,metaphysics, religion, and the occult exclusively with members of her Society. Unusual mystic medium and a psychic with unusual friends:Maria Orsic, a stunning beauty and an unusual medium was not an obscurepersonality.She was known to many celebrities of the era and had a fleet of very powerfuladmirers and friends both in Germany and abroad; famous, brilliant andinfluential people like Charles Lindbergh, Nikola Tesla, Marshal Tito ofYugoslavia, Henry Ford, Eva Peron, and the most illustrious figures in thespiritualism, parapsychological and psychical research in Great Britain. Thiswas reported by Allies intelligence and documented by OSS operatives in Europe.There is no doubt about it.Maria Orsic was well-known in other milieus and had lots of influential peopleoutside her circle who were very fond of her, to name a few:1-Princess Stephanie Marie von Hohenlohe (She was Jewish).2-Hanna Reitsch (Then, the most famous female pilot in the world).3-Leni Riefenstahl.4-The Horten Brothers, inventors of Horten 229.5-Leading figures in science such as Professor W. O. Schumann from the TechnicalUniversity of Munich.6-Arthur Sack.7-Dr. Eugen Sanger.8-Dr. Heinrich Richard Miethe.9-Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Dennis Gabor.10-Leaders of the Theosophical Society recognized Maria Orsic as a true medium.11-The British National Association of Spiritualists, established in 1873 (Namechanged to Central Association of Spiritualists in 1882, and again to LondonSpiritualist Alliance in 1884) which included psychics and spiritualists of allnationalities, races, sects, religions and opinions, as well eminent Englishfigures such as Dr. Stanhope Speer, Sir Charles Isham, Dawson Rogers, and Dr.Wyld corresponded with Maria Orsic.12-Eleanor Sidgwick, President of the English Society for Psychical Research in1932. 13-Dr. Charlie Dunbar Broad, philosopher and Professor of Moral Philosophy atCambridge in 1935 corresponded with Maria Orsic.14-French followers and disciples of Master Alan Kardec, the father of theworld’s Spiritism movement, revered her.15-And most certainly the leaders of Madame Blavatsky’s Theosophical Society ofthe era in Berlin, New York and India were in constant touch with Maria Orsic.Early writers of the Theosophical movement corresponded with her, and someTheosophists linguists offered her their linguistic expertise. It was awell-known fact in the metaphysical and spiritualism circles of the time, thatone of Madame Blavatsky’s associates who was an expert linguist in Hebrew,Phoenician, Akkadian, and Sumerian took a leading part in the translation andexplanation of the extraterrestrial messages Maria received in an unknownlanguage, later to be revealed a dead language of the Middle East whichcontained Ugaritic, Phoenician, Akkadian and Sumerian scripts; some passageswere written in cuneiform, and others in a script almost similar to the ByblosScript, and Ana’kh, a language the Anunnaki used to communicate with the earlyMesopotamians and Phoenicians.This is an undeniable fact.Maria Orsic was de facto the first person in history to have received some sortof messages not from this world. And I will elaborate on this, in passages tofollow.Maria’s childhood and schooling: Nothing was unusual or exceptionallyspectacular about Maria Orsic’s childhood.She grew up happy in a traditional and healthy family. She attended a Catholicschool, and in 1915, at age of 17, Maria Orsic graduated with honors. Maria Orsic’s contact with aliens (Beings of Lights) from Aldebaran.______________________________ a-February, Saturday 10, 1917;Maria’s first telepathic trance-contact:On Saturday 10 of 1917, and at the age of 19, Maria Orsic fell in a trance (orperhaps in a coma, for no apparent reasons) which lasted several hours.As soon as she came out of her coma and began to regain her senses, Maria Orsictold her mother that she saw tall beings of lights not from this world who cameto her and said that they will be back once she starts to feel better.During her state of trance, two tall beings talked to her in a language shecould not understand.Sabine, her mother thought that Maria was deeply affected by what had happenedto her, and made no remarks.But Maria Orsic was absolutely convinced that something extraordinary hasentered her life. b-February, Sunday 11, 1917;Maria’s second trance-extraterrestrial contact:Maria could not figure out what is happening to her, until she fell once againin a deep trance on February, Sunday 11, 1917; it was an event Maria will neverforget.On that Sunday, the strange beings of light appeared to her and told her thatvery soon, she will be receiving a very important message from them.The “Beings of Light” warned her not to tell anybody about what she hasexperienced, except to mediums Traute, Gudrun, Sigurn, and Heike, who weremembers of her mystic society “The Ladies of the Vril Society”.Maria rushed to talk to them about that extraordinary event.The women did not seem to be surprised at all.On the contrary, they were very quiet and understanding, and told Maria thatthey were expecting her to come to them. Maria Orsic became confused andperplexed.Sigurn reassured her that everything is going to be OK, and to expect to hearfrom them again. c-February, Monday 19, 1917;Maria’s third contact with the “Beings of Light”:On Monday, February 19 of 1917 in the afternoon, Maria Orsic was revisitedagain, but this time, the beings of light gave her a clear message; theyrevealed themselves to her as messengers (Extraterrestrials) from Aldebaran(Alpha Tauri), a solar system 65-years away from Earth, located in theconstellation Taurus, in front of the sprawling Hyades star cluster.The beings of light communicated with her telepathically using mindtransmission; Maria Orsic was able to receive their messages “mediumistically”. *** *** ***The Aliens’ MessagesExtraterrestrials’ messages in a secret German Templar script and ancientSumerian–Ugaritic cuneiform/Ana’kh language.______________________________ Maria Orsic claimed that she received the extraterrestrials’ messages in twolanguages totally unknown to her:a-A German Templar script;b-Ana’kh; part of this totally unknown language resembled anUgaritic-Sumerian-Akkadian cuneiform style of writing, while additional messagesappeared to be similar to early Phoenician writings in the form of the ByblosScript. Ana’kh was considered by the early inhabitants of the Middle East, NearEast, and Anatolia as the language of the Anunnaki, the gods and goddesses ofMesopotamia."},{"pageContent":"[../images/00058.jpeg]Friedrich Delitzsch (September 3, 1850 – December 19, 1922) Delitzsch was a distinguished linguist, and expert in the ancient languages ofthe Middle East, especially Assyrian and Sumerian. At one point, he said thatMaria Orsic’s cryptic text consisted of a very Old Babylonian language and ascript similar to Ugaritic cuneiform style of writing, but could not decipherthe Ana’kh text which contained the Aldebaran’s technical data on how to build asuper flying machine. He was puzzled by Ana’kh. _______________________________________________ "},{"pageContent":"Similar script found in Byblos:In 1940, the Vichy Government (Headed by Maréchal Philippe Pétain, who followingthe defeat of France signed a cease fire treaty with Hitler) found in thebasement of St. John Chapel in Byblos (Jbail) in Lebanon, an Ana’kh manuscriptsimilar to Maria Orsic’s script, describing an ancient Phoenician temple whichserved as an esoteric center used by the early remnants of the Anunnaki.In addition to the script, a tablet was discovered under the second layer of thechapel’s foundation, containing an archaic illustration of the Ana’kh symbolsidentical to symbols which appeared in the Aldebaran’s extraterrestrialsmessages, Maria Orsic received. I found this fascinating!!

TheAnunnaki’s Liquid Light or Mah’rit was mentioned in the tablets. ________________________________ The messages Orsic received from Aldebaran contained two separate kinds ofinformation:a-First kind of information:Mystical-Esoteric revelations.Metaphysical revelations and teachings on the “Duality of B’nin and Binat”,cosmic awareness, enlightenment, origin of the human race, history of the earlycivilizations on Earth, Atlantis, Lumeria, other worlds, and how the universewas created, etc. It is extremely important to keep in mind that Maria Orsic wasa mystic, a medium, a psychic, and a very spiritual woman.Maria Orsic and Sigrud decided to create a small group of mediums and psychics,who would be interested in studying and exploring telepathic contacts withextraterrestrials.Et voila, the “Alldeutsche Gesellschaft für Metaphysik” (All German Society forMetaphysics) was born, with Maria as leader (Head) of the Society, and Traute,Gudrun, Sigurn and Heike as charter-members.Later on, the society was renamed “Vril Gesellschaft”, (The Vril Society), alsoknown as the “Vrilerinnen” (Society of Vrilerinnen Women), and the women membersof the Society were referred to as the Ladies of the Vril. In 1941, the societywas renamed “Antriebstechnischen Werkstätten Vril” (Vril propeller or Drivetechnical workshops) and its status from a secret society to an open society waschanged too, because Adolf Hitler forbade secret societies.Maria’s Vril Society remained a secret society in essence, and was known in itsmilieu as “Die Kette\".It was widely believed in esoteric circles and mediums and channelers milieus,that Maria Orsic Vril Society, herself, Traute, Gudrun, Sigurn and Heikeremained in constant contact with the extraterrestrials from the Aldebaran solarsystem, and beings of lights from the Constellation of Taurus, from 1917 to1945.Before the end of 1945 and the collapse of Nazi Germany, Maria Orsic leftGermany to a destination, only few trusted associates and followers knew.However, many believe that the extraterrestrials rescued her from Himmler, andflew her to their planet, Aldebaran. a-Second kind of information:The Vril’s Technical data:This data contained Instructions on how to build a super flying machine, the“Vril”, known in Old Babylonian, Sumerian, Akkadian, Phoenician, Hebrew andArabic as Merkabah (Merka-vah) or a chariot.The instructions included elaborate technical and scientific data, maps,sketches, illustrations, and calendars (Riz-Mana), and “mathematical images” shecould only see in her mind, and receive telepathically.

Although they do not practice any religion, their senseand understanding of ethics, justice, good and evil deeds, and merits are welldeveloped. They see the universe, the development of the mind and a person’scharacter quite differently from the way we do.They take into a great consideration the consequences of an act, even aminiscule thought. They don’t have courts of law, trials, tribunals,prosecutors, judges, lawyers and corporal punishment, but they have establishedrules that govern behavior, merits, deeds, and social justice.“Their families, parents, children, relatives, and members of their communitiesare guided by social ethics and a moral law, far superior to our laws andreligions.They have families like us…they feel like us…they work together in a perfectharmony, using a collective awareness shared by all…” said Maria Orsic.(Note: This is exactly what Sinhar Anati said, and which I have published in oneof my books on the Anunnaki.) Worth mentioning here what Ulema Najani said on the subject:“The Anunnaki have families, fathers, mothers, and children too, and they followfamilial hierarchy, and family morality rules as we do here on Earth…”Anunnaki Ulema Sharif Naser Al-Bakr said, “Unlike other extraterrestrial racesand species that are not built around family structure and parental bonds, theAnunnaki live within their own families’ perimeter, and show feelings andemotional reactions as we do…” He added, “The head of a living unit or a familyis the father called “Raz” and “Abi”. However, the family is always placed underthe direct guidance of a mother. Anunnaki society is matriarchal.” What Maria Orsic told Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber about Jesus Christ andreligions._______________________ But first, who is Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber?Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber was the Archbishop of Munich in 1945.Quite often, he spoke publicly against Hitler and the SS.Three days after he passed away in 1952, a Catholic nun from Munic found aletter in Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber’s papers left in his desk’s drawers,written by Maria Orsic, and dated Tuesday 7, March 1944. Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich from 1917 to 1952, in aphoto of 1949 [../images/00065.jpeg] Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich during NAZI Germany._____________________________ Maria’s letter to Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber.Maria Orsic’s letter is of an extreme importance, for four reasons:1-She predicted that Joseph Ratzinger will become Pope.Worth mentioning here that Joseph Ratzinger was ordained priest by CardinalMichael von Faulhaber on June 29, 1951, six years after Maria had left Munich.In her letter, Maria Orsic asked the Archbishop to remind Father Ratzinger toreveal the truth about Mary Magdalene, once he becomes the Holy Father.In fact, Father Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope on April 19, 2005, and chosethe pontifical name Benedict. Thus he became Pope Benedict XVI. [../images/00066.jpeg] Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber laying hands on the head of Joseph Ratzinger, thefuture Pope Benedict XVI, on June 29, 1951.________________________________ 2-Maria Orsic’s letter contained the drawings of a rosette surrounded by twoscorpions. This is quite extraordinary because a rosette surrounded by twoscorpions represented the symbol of Inanna, the Anunnaki goddess who accordingto the Sumerian epics, took part in the creation of the first human beings inMesopotamia.3-Maria Orsic’s letter contained a small drawing of a star surrounded by a Hilal(Crescent), this is also extraordinary, because a star surrounded by a crescentwas one of the symbols of the Anunnaki, who genetically created the final formof the human race, according to the Sumeo-Akkadian cuneiform clay tablets foundin Nineveh, Mesopotamia (Modern Day Iraq). The symbol appeared on numerousMesopotamian slabs and clay tablets.http://wings.buffalo.edu/english/faculty/christian/syllabi/375/hhjw1/127026.jpg[../images/00067.jpeg]Sumerian Scorpions and Rosette, circa 3300 B.C.

Note on Stargates line; the 33.33 degree:Maria Orsic called her super flying machine (UFO to others) a flying machine foranother world; a flying machine for the afterlife; a flying machine for anotherdimension. Those were revolutionary concepts for her time, or unorthodox“Appellations”, to say the least.In her mind, that flying machine could enter and exit a different dimension,part physical and part abstract, simply by positioning the flying machine on astargates line she called the 33.33-degree line of Earth.Dr. Winfried Otto Schumann from the Technical University of Munich advised herto avoid implicating aliens in this scenario, and particularly the use ofscientific words, since she was not a scientist.The truth is, Maria never used scientific terminology, for herself admitted thatshe was not familiar with the technical data she received from Aldebaran, and/orany subject pertaining to aliens or extraterrestrials. What was she trying to tell the Archbishop of Munich?What kind of relation did exist between Maria Orsic, and the Archbishop?These two questions remained unanswered to the present day. However, we do knowthat Maria met with Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber in Munich on three occasions: * Wednesday 13, January 1943 * Tuesday 4, May 1943 * Thursday 24, February 1944 *** *** *** What Maria Orsic told Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber about theextraterrestrials, God and religions. image 1 [../images/00070.jpeg] Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber____________________________ Cardinal von Faulhaber and Maria discussed several religious, philosophical andsocial subjects, including but not limited to the medical experiments of Dr.Rascher, the detention of 2,345 Catholic priests at Dachau, and Maria’sextraterrestrial messages about religions, the nature of God Jesus Christ,Christianity, and the origin of Man.The Cardinal’s fascination with Maria Orsic’s psychic and channeling abilities,prompted him to ask her if she would or could set up a séance to communicatewith the spirit of Sister Franziska Streitel, the Franciscan nun who died in1911.Politely, Maria Orsic told Cardinal von Faulhaber that she communicates onlywith extraterrestrials; however, she will be glad to discuss with him what theAdelbaran’s beings of light told her about God, Jesus, religion, theextraterrestrial civilizations on Earth, and the salvation of the human race.The Cardinal was so eager and anxious to hear what Maria could possibly tell himabout God, Jesus Christ, earth’s religions and particularly Christianity.

In what language?Maria: Mentally…they send me visions and messages I caught in my mind.I have also received instructions and revelations in ancient languages.Cardinal: What ancient languages?Maria: A form of an old Sumerian language mixed with Ana’kh, as explained to meby experts and linguists.Cardinal: Ana’kh? What is that?Maria: Their language. They speak Ana’kh. It is the language of the Aldebaranpeople and the Anunnaki.Cardinal: Anunnaki? Meaning what?Maria: The Anunnaki are the extraterrestrials being of light who created usthousands of years ago.Cardinal: What are you talking about my dear child. This is a blasphemy. Don’tyou know God created us? Didn’t you read your Bible?Maria: I did…I read the Bible many times, but the truth is not in the Bible.Cardinal: What truth are you talking about?Maria: The truth about who is God, who is Jesus Christ, who is Mary Magdalene,who created us, life on other planets, our origin…Cardinal: The aliens told you that they created us?Maria: Yes, your eminence.

Not in my trance.However, we discovered later after reading the translations of the ancientscripts, that Jesus Christ’s name was not mentioned as Jesus but as Imanuil. AndI did not know who Imanuil was.Cardinal: What did they say about Imanuil?Maria: They said that he did not die on the cross. And he was not born in Israelbut in Phoenicia. And I have no idea what and where Phoenicia is. They also saidthat he was a being of light and an exceptional healer.Cardinal: Did you ask them about our Lord Jesus Christ?Maria: I did not. I just read heard it in my mind when I was in trance. Maybe Ihave, but I don’t remember everything I have said, asked or heard.Cardinal: Did they tell you anything about the devil and his temptations?Maria: No. Nothing.Cardinal: So, if they don’t believe in God, they would not believe in our LordJesus Christ either. Correct?Maria: Correct?Cardinal: What do they believe in?Do they have a religion they follow?Maria: No. They don’t have any religion.They don’t need any…they know…they know the greatest secrets of the universe,and they know there is no God…they told me there is a cosmic logic, a cosmiclaw, some sort of benevolent and positive energy that created the universe andwe are part of it…and the most important thing is to follow the light and befair and just.Cardinal: I see….Are they humans or angels?Or something else?Maria: We were created in their image.Cardinal: Who created us in their image?Maria: They did.Cardinal: Why did they contact you?Maria: They wanted me to create a spaceship.Cardinal: A spaceship? What for?Why didn’t they contact the Luftwaffe?Maria: Because the Luftwaffe is evil.Cardinal: I see.They are right about that…about the spaceship, tell me more, what are you goingto do with the spaceship?Do you know how to build a spaceship?Maria: It is built already.Cardinal: Who built it?Maria: People I trust.Cardinal: Possibly, your aliens could be angels or another manifestation ofGod’s creation? What do you think?Maria: I don’t know…I don’t know anything about God’s another creation. And Idon’t think they are angels. They are simply beings of light from a veryadvanced civilization.Cardinal: Did they talk to you about hell and heaven?Maria: There is no hell. Hell is only here on Earth.Cardinal: And how about heaven?

Maria Orsic explained to us that communication withextraterrestrials is possible only if they initiate contacts.The psychics were brought in because the military thought that the “Alienphenomenon” could be of a paranormal and a metaphysical nature, based upon thedistorted opinions of psychologists and psychiatrists who were briefly hired bythe United States Air Force.Of course, and as anticipated, the military did not describe the aliens’spacecrafts as a paranormal thing, because they have already started to callupon scientists and engineers to find out how their spacecrafts flew, and howthe military could reverse the aliens’ technology.Nevertheless, the mere idea that these aliens and their crafts were not fromthis world pushed the military to explore all the possibilities, including thesupernatural and religious aspects of the phenomenon.By the end of 1949, the services of the psychics and mediums were permanentlyterminated by the military.But in March of 1950, one psychic was recalled when a major general brought tothe discussions table the files of the “Vril-Gesellschaft”, and the AliensTranscripts of 1947.In 1959, von Braun stated: “We find ourselves faced by powers which are farstronger than hitherto assumed, and whose base is at present unknown to us.http://images.spaceref.com/news/2009/ooGPN-2000-000070.jpg[../images/00074.jpeg]Dr. von Braun.Dr. von Braun admitted that Maria Orsic Vril was successful. In fact, secretreports show that he tried to duplicate one of Maria’s small crafts (UFOs).Newspapers in Norway, Germany and Sweden published articles to that effect.___________________________________ More? I cannot say at the present.We are now engaged in entering into closer contact with those powers, and withinsix or nine months’ time it may be possible to speak with more precision on thematter.” *** *** *** The spiritual-religious aspects of the revelations of aliens are reconsidered.Dr. von Braun, as he admitted much later, remained vividly interested in MariaOrsic’s revelations because they were part scientific and part metaphysical.In addition, while he was still working for the Nazis until 1945, he learnedabout Maria Orsic’s Vril and the spiritual-metaphysical activities and practicesof the Society of the Ladies of the Vril headed by Maria Orsic.And upon reviewing the Aliens Transcripts of 1948 and 1949, he became fullyconvinced that the spiritual-religious aspects of the revelations of the alienwe met in 1947, as well as the revelations of Maria Orsic in 1920 and 1921 wereclosely connected and related to religious and metaphysical beliefs. In fact,those very spiritual beliefs and convictions stimulated the determination ofMaria Orsic for building the Earth’s first man-made anti-gravity flying machine. “Project Spirit”.Based upon the recommendations of Dr. von Braun, the military reconsidered thepossibility of re-examining the religious-spiritual accounts of Maria Orsic, andthe alien, which were totally disregarded, because they were of “no use forscientific and military purposes” as stated by the United States Air Force.Thus, the military hired parapsychologists psychologists, and twopsychics/channelers to re-study the matter, and “Project Spirit” came to life.The psychics were joined by Dr. Joseph Banks Rhine, founder of theParapsychological Association. Dr. Rhine was known for his pioneeringparapsychology laboratory and research center at Duke University. Dr. JosephRhine spent approximately 180 hours on researching and assessing the paranormaland spiritual aspects of the alien phenomenon, and related messages.However, and once again, by July of 1950, all supernatural and paranormalstudies of the aliens came to a halt. And from that moment, no more psychics,parapsychologists or Church’s officials were asked to attend any forthcomingmeetings with aliens.

Andfor several months, the findings of the Branch, and the reports of thePresidential Committee were kept secret.It was not until mid-November of 1951 that the Branch’s studies, findings andreports were shared with other agencies and the military.But the reports, recommendations, memoranda and summaries of the PresidentialCommittee were known only to the President of the United States and to two ofhis personal advisors/assistants; Dr. Vannevar Bush was one of them.

Maria Orsic never met Charles Lindbergh. And Maria was neveranti-Semite!! However, both exchanged extensive correspondences. Dr. Carl Jung. [../images/00078.jpeg] Dr. Carl Jung___________________________________ According to Dr. Carl Jung, the father of the “Collective Unconscious”theory, UFOs could be linked to the symbol of mandala.On July 30, 1958, the New York Herald Tribune, published a report by theAssociated Press from Alamogordo, New Mexico, about Dr. Carl Jung’s opinions ofUFOs.Here is an excerpt from the published article: Dr. Carl Jung, Swisspsychologist, says in a report released yesterday that unidentified flyingobjects are real, and show signs of intelligent guidance by quasi-human pilots.“I can only say for certain that these things are not a mere rumor. Somethinghas been seen.A purely psychological explanation is ruled out”.Dr. Jung, who had started his research on UFOs in 1944, issued his statementthrough the UFO-Filter Centre of the Aerial Phenomena Research Association(A.P.R.O.) here. He said: “I have gathered a mass of observations ofunidentified flying objects since 1944.The disks do not behave in accordance with physical laws, but as though withoutweight. If the extraterrestrial origin of these phenomena should be confirmed,this would prove the existence of an intelligent interplanetary relationship.What such a fact might mean for humanity and religions cannot be predicted, butcould alter the norms of morality.” *** *** *** Aliens Rewinding Time Technology:Through their rewinding time technology, the aliens revealed and explained to usso many events from our history’s past, and the truth about people who haveshaped our beliefs, religions, traditions and distorted history.In 1957 and 1958, the Gray aliens told President Eisenhower about the rewindingtime technology. The military scientists and President Eisenhower did notbelieve it is possible, until the Grays “rewound the tape of time” to the pointthat the military were not only able to see a holographic projection of Jesus,but also to listen to his voice.General Marshall was present at the meeting, and decided to ask the Grays ifthey could re-project an event that occurred in World War II, known only toGeneral Omar Bradley, General Patton, General Eisenhower and himself.He gave them the date and location of the event, and waited for the holographicprojection.The holographic projection was mesmerizing, and what the generals saw wasaccurate down to the very last detail. The Grays then went even one step furtherto reveal two letters within the holographic projection;a) A speech to be given by Eisenhower in the event of a successful storming ofthe beaches of Normandy on D-Day.b) A speech to be given, in the event that D-Day landing was a failure.The existence and contents of the two letters were known only to General OmarBradley and Dwight Eisenhower. Also projected were the six draft letters writtenby Eisenhower and his secretary. *** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"BACK MATTERAlso by Maximillien de Lafayette_______________________________[../images/00079.jpeg]THESAURUS AND LEXICON OF SIMILAR WORDS AND SYNONYMS IN 21 DEAD AND ANCIENTLANGUAGES AND DIALECTS (A)Also available in 2 separate volumes.

Judgeship. • Dayono in ancient Assyrian means a judge; a magistrate. • Dayono in contemporary Assyrian Western dialect. • Dayono in Aramaic. • Also Dayanu in Akkadian. • Dayan in Arabic means a judge; a head of a tribunal or a council. Literally,it means the one who judges people for their deeds and actions at the end oftime (Day of Judgment); in this context, it refers to Allah (God). • Dayyan (Talmudic Judge) in Hebrew. • Dayonutho in ancient Assyrian and contemporary Assyrian Western dialect meansjudgeship. • Daianuta in contemporary Assyrian Eastern dialect. • Din in ancient Assyrian means the law. • Dino in ancient Hebrew. • Dinatu in Babylonian-Assyrian means laws. • “Dinatu attu-a in birid mati aganetu usazgu.” From the Behistun Inscriptions. • Translated verbatim: “My laws amongst these provinces flourished. • Dinu in Akkadian and Babylonian-Assyrian means to judge, and to rule. • Bet diino in Aramaic means a court of law, a tribunal, and a courthouse.• In Arabic, Beth-diin means house of religion. • Beth-diino is composed of two words: • a-Beth, which means a house, • b-Diino, which means the law. From diino derived the Hebrew and Arabic words Dayan, which means a judge, moreprecisely a Talmudic judge and a judge in a religious court. Diino is Diin in Arabic, and its means religion. In ancient Islamic literature and religious texts, Dayan refers to God (Allah)the judge who will pass judgment on dead people at the end of time. Theprimitive meaning of Dino was religion. In Arabic, it is Din (Religion), as wellas Dayana, Diyana. So, the primordial meaning was a religious tribunal. This is understandable,because in ancient times, all laws (Civil, social, military, penal, etc.) werebased upon religious dogma and teachings. Worth mentioning here, that there is a famous historic city in Lebanon calledBeit El-Din “Bet Din”, “Beiteddin”. At one time in history, this ancient city was the most important city in Lebanonand the siege of Emir (Prince) Bashir Chehab, the ruler of Lebanon, appointed bythe Sultan of Turkey. The Castle of Beiteddin, \"House Of Faith\", built by Prince Chehab is one ofLebanon's greatest treasures. The palace reflects the typical oriental architecture of the 19th century. • Eseru: Akkadian/Assyrian. Noun. Adjective. • Captured. • Imprisoned. • Held hostage. • Assyra in contemporary Assyrian Eastern dialect. • Asyr in Arabic (Masculine form); Asyra (Feminine form). • Asyr in Persian (Farsi). • Esir in Turkish. • Asir in Urdu. • Asira in Aramaic, and it means a prisoner. • Asira qrawa means a prisoner of war. *** *** *** De Lafayette Old Assyrian-Neo Assyrian-English Dictionary [../images/00081.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"ANCIENT AND MODERN ARAMAIC ASSYRIAN SYRIAC-ENGLISH DICTIONARY[../images/00082.jpeg] Aramaic is the language spoken by Jesus Christ, the Essenes and the great Rabbisof the Talmud.A set of 5 volumes of approximately 1,200 pages.

And how eventsor circumstances “operate” for or against an individual?Merriam-Webster does not provide an explanation.There is a force that shapes and conditions luck; it is the force of theMaktoob, meaning what it is already written in the “Kitbu Dounia”, meaning thebook of our life, the book of our fate; the book of our destiny.And how do we explain the mode of operation of events or circumstances that workfor us or against us?The mode of operation of what constitutes “Luck” is always conditioned by unseenmetaphysical factors, only known to the Anunnaki Ulema and Sahiriin.Basically, these factors include:Factors which influence your future and luck:• Maktoob.The fluctuation of the “Grid of Calendar” of the good hours and bad hours in ourlives: Rizmanah.
