Consequently, many topics andimportant subjects were lost in the immensity of information and findingsprovided in all of his massive published work. It was too much, too large, andtoo varied. This created some inconvenience and difficulties in finding subjectsof interest to many readers.The world of the Anunnaki is immense, and so too is the work of Mr. deLafayette.For example, if you have not purchased all of his books, and/or if you did notclassify/categorize a subject you are interested in, it would be impossible tohave direct and easy access to the subject or topic you are interested in.Where would you find an article on an Anunnaki’s life on their planet?The Anunnaki genetic creation of the human race?How the Anunnaki created religions on Earth?The habitat of the Greys?The habitat of the hybrid race?Chronology of the Anunnaki on Earth?The return of the Anunnaki in 2022? And so on…You do admit, it is a hard task to find these subjects without going through theentire body of Mr. de Lafayette’s work.This convinced us that –in the best interest of the readers– we should providethe public with a series of the most important findings and articles that meetyour needs, and facilitate your search for a particular subject.The series “The most important aspects and characteristic features of theAnunnaki and extraterrestrials” consists of approximately 40 books/booklets,each, containing one major topic, which was spread in several books.Here is a list of the titles of the 40 books/booklets of the series:___________________ > • Book 1: You, in the Afterlife, Parallel Dimensions and Beyond the Future of> Time and Space.> • Book 2: The German UFOs and the supernatural> • Book 3: Baalbeck: The Anunnaki’s City and Afrit Underground.> • Book 4: The Anunnaki’s genetic creation of the human race.> • Book 5: Adonis, Dumuzi and the Anunnaki.> • Book 6: The Afarit, Djins and the Anunnaki.> • Book 7: The Anunnaki Ba’abs: Stargates.> • Book 8: The Anunnaki, Yahweh and God.> • Book 9: Abraham and the Anunnaki.> • Book 10: St. Tekla, the First Anunnaki Hybrid Christian Saint.> • Book 11: 2022, The year the Anunnaki return to Earth.> • Book 12: The Anunnaki, Cheribu and Angels on Earth.> • Book 13: The Anunnaki classes and categories.> • Book 14: Dido, the Anunnaki-Phoenician Princess.> • Book 15: The Anunnaki and Enlil.> • Book 16: The Anunnaki and Enki.> • Book 17: The name the Anunnaki gave you before you were born.> • Book 17: The Anunnaki and Fikr.> • Book 18: The Anunnaki winged disk and their symbols on Earth.> • Book 19: The Anunnaki and the secret esoteric meaning of the mushroom/Holy> Grail.> • Book 20: The Anunnaki’s Conduit and the creation of our brains’ cells.> • Book 21: Grids and calendar of our lucky hours and days.> • Book 22: The Anunnaki Miraya.> • Book 23: The Anunnaki and the Hyksos.> • Book 24: The Hybrid race from A to Z.

[Image00004.gif] Baalbeck, in Lebanon (Ancient Phoenicia) was one of the earliest cities/coloniesof the Anunnaki on Earth.______________________________ I. Definition and introduction:Name of a legendary city in Lebanon. Baalbiki was the name of the city ofBaalbeck in Assyrian and Akkadian. Baal’bak and Balbeck in Arabic.Numerous historians believe that the site of Baalbeck dates back 4,000 years,B.C., when the Canaanites built a temple to worship \"Baal\" the Semitic God ofthunders and storms. But the real history of Baalbeck dates back 7,000 yearsB.C.In the Hellenistic ages, Baalbeck was called Heliopolis \"The City Of Sun\" as itis known till nowadays, identified with the Greek Sun God \"Helios\". Baalbeck wasmentioned in ancient Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Akkadian, Chaldean,Hittite, and Persians epics, texts, and tablets.Baalbeck has the world’s largest freestone in the world : 65 feet in length and13 feet in width. [Image00005.gif] Ruins of one of the Roman temples at Baalbeck. ________________________ Baalbeck is one of Lebanon's oldest cities , and one of the most important Romansites in the Middle East .Baalbeck was the home of the most marvelous ruins and temples of the RomanEmpire. Its gigantic acropolis presented one of the very unique, and biggestprojects conceived in the history of world architecture. In addition, it has thelargest freestone in the world : 21.5m long (Almost 65 feet) and 4.8m wide(Almost 13 feet).Tourist from around the globe are astonished by the remaining of Baalbeck’stemples that took hundred years to build. The most famous are the following:1 -The Temple of Jupiter:The Temple of Jupiter Heliopolitanus was never fully completed. Today, only sixgigantic columns remained.2 -The Temple of Bacchus:The Temple of Bacchus is well preserved. Its issurrounded by 42 columns.3 -The Temple of Venus:Outside the acropolis stand the circular Temple of Venus.4 -The Temple of Mercury. II: Baalbeck; the city of gods, Biblical figures, and the Djinns (Jinn):The Arabs believed that Baalbeck was rebuilt by the legendary Nimrod, who onceruled this area of Phoenicia (Modern day Lebanon.)According to an ancient Arabic manuscript found at Baalbeck, Nimrod sent a fleetof giants to rebuild Baalbeck, three months after the Flood .Another Arab myth tells us that Nimrod rebelled against his God and decided tobuild the Tower of Babel at Baalbeck. According to a third legend,Cain , the son of Adam, built Baalbeck as his last refuge after his God Yahweh[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_jehovah.htm] puta curse on him. *** *** ***A column from the [Image00006.jpg]  [Image00007.gif] A swastika sign on one of the Jupiter Temple’s column in Baalbeck, linking thebuilders of the temple/early inhabitants of Baalbeck to the esoteric masters ofTibet, and the extraterrestrial gods of India (Hindu and Buddhism). ___________________________ [Image00008.gif] Estfan Doweihi , the Maronite Patriarch of Lebanon._________________________________ According to his Eminence Estfan Doweihi , the Maronite Patriarch of Lebanon:“Tradition states that the fortress of Baalbeck is the most ancient building inthe world. Cain, the son of Adam, built it in the year 133 of the creation,during a fit of raving madness.He gave it the name of his son Enoch and peopled it with giants who werepunished for their iniquities by the flood.”According to Ulema literature, Baalbeck (Baalaback in Arabic and Lebanese) isone of the oldest habitats on earth, built by the early Phoenicians and theAnunnaki during their first and second landings on Earth. [Image00009.gif] The Trilithon of Baalbeck. The base of the Temple of Jupiter is called the Trilithon, and it is constructedof three 1200-tonne limestone megalithic stones. Legend has it, that the templewas constructed by a fleet of giants sent by Nimrod.An ancient Arab fable tells us that the Afrit of King Solomon built the temple._______________________________ [Image00010.gif] Baalbeck, the country of the gods and the Anunnaki. ________________________ [Image00011.gif] Photo: Muslim Turkish conqueror Tamerlane pillaged and destroyed the city, andseveral Roman-Phoenician-Anunnaki temples and altars. Baalbeck was the original space mission center of the Anunnaki. Today, alaunching pad for extraterrestrial spaceships is still visible at Baalbecknearby the Temple of Jupiter.Later on in history, Baalbeck became a major occult and a healing center visitedby many kings and emperors. Attracted by its beauty and supernatural properties,the Roman emperor Augustus made Baalbeck a Roman colony and a major oraclesshrine. *** *** *** In fact, the Roman emperor Trajan consulted a celebrated oracle in Baalbeck.Unfortunately, Baalbeck was totally sacked and decimated by the Muslim Arabs in748 A.D.In 1,400 A.D., the Muslim Turkish conqueror Tamerlane pillaged and destroyed thecity, and several Roman-Phoenician-Anunnaki temples and altars. In 1,759 A.D., amajor earthquake decimated the remaining ruins and almost all what was left fromthe Anunnaki-Phoenician monuments.There is one place on earth, the Ulema consider as the ultimate “terminal” ofthe Anunnaki; a sort of a Ba’ab from which a person enters or exits a physicaldimension. And that place is Baalbeck.Thousands of years ago, and long before the Sumerians established their kingdomin Iraq, and interacted with the Anunnaki, and many many centuries before thehuman race in any region of the world learned about God or Gods, the Anunnakilanded in Baalbeck, and revealed to its inhabitants many secrets, includingteleportation, psychic healings, and the divine nature of the supreme beings(Gods, creators).Baalbeck served them as a landing and a launching post. It still exists today. *** *** *** [Image00012.gif] The ruins of Baalbeck. ______________________ III. Gilgamesh, Al Arz, Baalbeck and immortality:Baalbeck was the rendezvous and favorite sacred place of the kings and deitiesof Sumer, Babylon and Egypt, because it was the first city established by theAnunnaki on earth.The legendary king of Uruk, the Anunnaki king-god Gilgamesh visited Baalbeck,and worshiped there. He worshiped higher gods.Why did he go to Baalbeck?What did he expect to find?Gilgamesh hoped to acquire immortality and extra supernatural powers from thegods who lived in Baalbeck. The gods welcomed Gilgamesh and told him Baalbeck isthe entrance to the other world; to the primordial sphere that created Earth andthe human race.The gods of Baalbeck directed Gilgamesh to the secret celestial Ba’ab of hisancestors the Anunnaki; from that Ba’ab (Exit), Gilgamesh could reach Ashtari ina blink of an eye.The Gods also told Gilgamesh that as soon as he enters the Ba’ab he will becomeimmortal, but he should continue his journey to Ashtari (Nibiru), and Gilgameshdid. And Gilgamesh asked the gods: “Will the Ba’ab take me directly to Ashtari,so I would reach immortality?” and the gods answered: “Eventually, but first,you must make a short stop at the spring of immortality at Al Arz (Cedar tree),a sacred region of your ancestors, the Anunnaki…” And Gilgamesh asked again: “Where is Al Arz?”And the gods answered:“Not very far from here…it is the highest and mightiest mountain in Phoenicia,where the Anunnaki your ancestorsplanted the cedar trees…and on the top of the mountainsyou will land for a short timewhere you will clean your thoughts and mind…and you will stroll under the branchesof the cedar trees…and short after you will continue your journeyto Ashtari…and immortality you shall have…” [Image00013.gif] Gilgamesh Al Arz is a mountainous region in Lebanon (Ancient Phoenicia), where theBiblical cedar trees grow; the same trees King Hiram of Tyre used to build theTemple of Solomon, and King Tut An’k Amoon used to decorate his palaces. AlsoNoah’s boat was built with Phoenicia’s Arz trees.Al Arz means cedar trees in Arabic and Phoenician. It is derived from theAnunnaki’s language “An’k”. The Sumerians believed that Al Arz and Baalbeck arethe holy cities where immortality lives as disguised gods on planet earth. Thisis why Gilgamesh traveled to these two old Anunnaki-Phoenician cities. IV. A visit to the underground city of the Djinn and Afrit.The following is an excerpt from the book “On the Road to Ultimate Knowledge:Extraterrestrial Tao of the Anunnaki and Ulema”, co-authored by Maximillien deLafayette, and Ilil Arbel.Chapter Three: Germain Lumiere, a young Anunnaki-Ulema is telling the story ofhis visit to Baalback.I graduated from high school at seventeen, and was free for a while. Muchthought had to be given to the decision and preparations for my universitystudies. I expressed a desire to go to Paris for that purpose, and wasconsidering various fields, but nothing was final. I did not mind a little timeoff, though, and enjoyed my temporary idleness very much. At that time, theMaster was visiting us, and as usual, had an incredibly exciting plan for me.“Have you ever been to Baalbeck?” he asked.“No, never.”“It’s an interesting city, very old. There is a lot of controversy as to whobuilt it, though.”“Isn’t there some historical evidence?”“Plenty, but there are four interpretations.The Christian Lebanese say it was built by the Phoenicians. The Muslim Lebaneseprefer a theory claiming it was built by Djinn and Afrit. Some important occultleaders say it was built by Adam, after he was kicked out of Paradise. Well…”“And the Ulema, what do they think?” I asked, knowing that this was the theory Iwould trust. [Image00014.gif] The ruins of Baalbeck. ___________________ [Image00015.gif] The original Baalbeck. __________________________________ Al Arz, Lebanon.[Image00016.gif]Al Arz mountains, Lebanon. The holy site of the early Anunnaki, and whereGilgamesh sought immortality. [Image00017.gif] The Cedar Forest, where Gilgamesh spent a few days imploring the Anunnaki gods,to grant him immortality. “The Ulema say it was built by the Anunnaki and the proto-Phoenicians who livedon the island of Arwad and in Tyre. There is a lot of evidence in thisdirection.”“So will I see the ancient parts?”“Of course. I would like to take you to a very special part of the city, wherethe Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to meet thousands of years ago.Unfortunately, we no longer meet there, because it became a tourist attractionand a state-controlled center of music and dance festivals. It will be fun foryou, though, to mingle with all these tourists, it’s a nice place.”“But surely that is not the reason for going,” I said.“No, it is not. I plan to take you to a secret underground city under Baalbeck,and show you where the Anunnaki landed for the first time on earth. Very fewpeople know what is going on under the modern city of Baalbeck.The first Anunnaki landing took place before the Deluge, though they came againand again after the Deluge as well.”“Before the Deluge? When was that, exactly?” I asked.“About 450,000 years ago, perhaps a bit longer. At that time, the Anunnakicreated the humans.”“And what about God?” I asked. Even though I was taught much of the Ulematraditions and world view, I never heard about the creation of the human race.“No one ever heard of God 450,000 years ago. You start to hear about God onlyaround 6,000 years ago,” said the Master. I knew enough about the Anunnaki atthat time to accept this without much trouble, so I went to find Mama and Sylvieand tell them about the upcoming trip. The trip from Damascus to Baalbeck could be accomplished in about two hours, atleast you could do that if you traveled in a decent car. We took a bit longer toget there, since the car, borrowed from a friend of the Master who was also todrive us there, was an ancient Mercedes that did not use normal gasoline butrather employed mazut , or diesel fuel, and made such a racket it was impossibleto hear yourself think. To my surprise, I saw a mysterious Sudanese man sitting in the back seat,dressed in ill matching jacket and pants and scowling at us.At the Master’s request, he started to get out of the car to introduce himself.I watched the process in fascination, since he was not doing it quickly like anormal person, but instead was slowly extricating himself in stages, graduallydisentangling himself, like a huge snake. I have never seen such a tall man, oranyone as strange.He was about seven feet tall, very thin, and his face did not look quite humanto me, but like a giant from outer space.This bizarre apparition just stood there, looked fierce, and played with astring of amber beads. The Master ignored his uncouth behavior and introducedus.“This is Taj,” he said. “His name means ‘Crown.’ He is joining us because he hasthe key to the gate of the secret city underground. He is also able to persuadethe Djinn and the Afrit to open certain doors, which is quite a talent.” I wasnot sure if the Master was joking about the Djinn and the Afrit, so I keptquiet, nodded to the Sudanese, and got in the back seat.Taj folded himself back into the car and sat beside me, the Master went into thefront seat, and the driver, who seemed to be normal and cheerful, greeted theMaster and me in a friendly way.The car started making a noise that was worthy of demons, but I did not carebecause I was thinking about the real devils, the Djinn and the Afrit.I leaned forward and asked the Master, “Would I be able to see the Djinn andAfrit?”“Yes, of course,” said the Master casually. “You can even try to talk to them,if you like. The underground city is actually called the City of the Djinn andthe Afrit; plenty of devils are there.”Since these devils did not seem to frighten the Master, I assumed he knew whathe was doing, and sat thinking about what my part could be in this unbelievableadventure. However, I was aware of increasing irritation by what Taj was doing. He constantly played with his amber beads, clicking away on and on. I asked,“Why do you have to click these things all the time?”Taj seemed annoyed by my question. “Try them yourself,” he said curtly, andhanded them to me.I grabbed at them, and instantly, a horrible electric shock went through myentire body, quite painfully, and I cried out and threw the beads on the floorof the car. The Master screamed at Taj, “How dare you? How many times did I tellyou never to do that? Give me the beads immediately!”Taj handed him the beads, meekly enough, and had the grace to look embarrassed.The Master rubbed the beads, seemingly absorbing and removing the energy, andthen returned them to me. “You can try them now,” he said. “And don’t give themback to Taj until I tell you to.” Taj said nothing. He seemed unhappy in thecar, constantly fidgeting, and could not sit still. Perhaps he wasclaustrophobic, I thought, and the confined space bothered him. We drove on.Finally we arrived in Baalbeck. “Where now?” said the driver.“We are going to the Athar , the ruins,” said the Master.“I don’t know how to get there,” said the driver. “Shall I ask for directions?”He parked the car. There were many people around, some Arabs in traditionalgarb, some Europeans in every kind of attire and carrying backpacks and cameras.It seemed to be such a normal, cheerful place. I thought of the festivals andthe music; how could there be Afrit and Djinn and all sorts of undergroundlabyrinths in a place like that? It was as modern as can be.“When you are with Taj, you do not ask for directions,” said the Sudanese with asuperior air. The driver shrugged, not quite convinced.Taj winked at me and stared at the driver’s neck, concentrating. The driversuddenly started to beat his own neck, complaining how much he hated mosquitoes.I was certain there were no mosquitoes in the car, and I was sure that Tajcreated the imaginary insects that were tormenting the driver. Baalbeck today: Nothing impressive. [Image00018.gif] The driver’s neck became really red.“Taj, stop this nonsense immediately!” said the Master severely. Apparently, Tajcould send certain energy rays that had the capacity of annoying people. Tajstopped, gave the driver the necessary directions, and we went to the Athar.“First, let’s go to the world biggest stone,” said Taj. We drove further, and aswe turned a road toward the Temple of Jupiter, I was shocked by the sight thatmet my eyes. It was a huge gray slab, partially buried in the sand, perfectlycut and smooth.It was unquestionably man made, not a natural formation, a short distance fromthe Temple. How in the world could such a stone get there?Who could have carried it?This stone was so immense that the stones of the Egyptian pyramids would beinfinitely small, completely dwarfed, if put next to it.The Stonehenge monoliths would be insignificant if they were placed next to it.In addition, it was immensely old, and even modern equipment could hardly copewith such a giant, let alone ancient technology.“How big is this stone?” I asked, truly awed by the sight.“Seventeen hundred tons,” said the Master.“It is hand made, isn’t it?” I said. “It is too straight to be natural. Itsimply can’t be natural. And yet, how could it get here, if it is artificial? Itjust can’t!”Taj grinned and said, “Hand made, yes, but not by human hands.”I was beginning to get the idea. “Then who made it?” I asked.“It was part of the landing area used by the Anunnaki,” said the Master. “Thereare six stones like it. Only the Anunnaki could move such a slab.”“Ah, but I can make it fly,” boasted Taj.“You must be crazy,” I said, disgusted with him.“You want to see?” He said.“Sure,” I said. “I would like to see you do that.” *** *** ***[Image00019.gif] The town of Baalbeck.Modern Baalbeck is a Shiite Muslim stronghold. “Very well, but not when so many people are around. We will be back around nineo’clock, no one is around, I will show you.”Since it was around four o’clock in the afternoon, I was wondering how we wouldspend the time, but the Master had his own plan.“We have plenty of time to do what needs to be done,” he said. “I would like youto meet Cheik Al Huseini.” This was the first time I met the great man, wholater contributed greatly to my studies.We went back into the car, and drove to the Cheik’s house. The house was smalland modest, built sturdily of stone, with thick walls. The door was low, as wasnormal for middle class Arab houses. This style was followed for many years, forthe sake of safety and security.Apparently, the conquering Ottomans used to sweep into houses that had largeentrances while riding on their horses, and thus be able to kill and destroyanyone and everything inside. The low entrances forced the rider to get off hishorse first, making him much less dangerous to the inhabitants.In the big living room, which they called the Dar , many sofas were placedagainst the walls, arranged next to each other. About twenty to thirty men werepresent, dressed in Arab robes and turbans. All were elderly, with long whitebeards. The Cheik was sitting in the place of honor.When the Master arrived, everyone stood up, repeating the word “ oustaz, oustaz,” to each other, meaning “teacher.” Someone pointed at Taj, and said, “TheAfrit is already here.” I thought this description fitted Taj perfectly, butexpected him to be angry. To my surprise, he seemed pleased by being called thatname, and grinned at me like a delighted child.We sat down, and the men came to kiss the hand of the Master. The light was low,only one lamp was turned on, but I could see that one person did not get up fromhis seat. Since this was strange behavior, I looked at him carefully, and to myamazement recognized the old Tuareg, whom I had met years ago in the suk inDamascus, the man who was cut in half. He recognized me as well, smiled, and motioned to me to come and sit by him. Icame, and he said jokingly, “Don’t start searching for the rest of my body…”I laughed, a little guilty, because that was exactly what I was planning to do.At any rate I could see nothing, since the long robe he wore covered everything.Everyone conversed in Arabic, which by now I spoke very well, and after a whilethe Cheik motioned most people out. Eight of us remained in the room.The Master, Taj, and myself, were the only outsiders.The Cheik, the Tuareg, and three other elderly Arabs completed the number of thepeople who were permitted to attend.At that moment, a man came from an inside room, carrying a big copper pot, fullof steaming hot water. He put the pot on a table in front of the Cheik,addressing him by the title Mawlana .This title meant “you are a ruler over me,” and was used only to address kings,sultans, or prophets. I was surprised. This title belonged to very importantpeople, but the house and everything in it spoke of middle class. So what couldthis mean? The Cheik must have been a very important person, somehow. I plannedto ask the Master about it later, not wishing to disturb him with questions atthe moment, since I was sure strange things were about to begin to occur.I was sitting near enough to the Cheik to see everything very clearly, andwaited breathlessly for the events that were to come. The Cheik took threepieces of blank paper, and threw them into the hot water in the coppercontainer.The room was completely silent, no one moved, except Taj, who whispered to me,“You are going to like what you see, it’s fun, but don’t move no matter whathappens.” I nodded, and concentrated on the pot, looking occasionally at Taj forclarification.Somehow he assumed the role of my guide to the occult world, and I realized heknew exactly what was taking place. “Shush, just look at the container,something is about to happen,” he said. I went on staring at the pot. Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, the water in the container disappeared, and thethree pieces of paper burst out of the container. They lined up in the air,without any support, one after the other. They waved about for a few seconds,then merged and became one larger piece.The piece of paper started swirling in the air, rotating around itself, quickerand quicker, and suddenly stopped in mid motion. It was suspended in the air,completely still, and in a flash, letters appeared on it, printed clear, black,and easily visible from where I was sitting, though I could not make out thewords. The Cheik got up, approached the paper, read the words, and then asked one ofthe people attending to close the shutters on all the windows. The room becamevery dark, and the words, seemingly separated from the paper, glowed in air likea bright hologram.The Cheik called Taj, and asked him to read the words. I could not hear whatthey said to each other, but they seemed to agree on something, as they stoodthere, nodding their heads.Then Taj came back to me.I asked him, “What was that?” He stepped on my foot to quiet me. His largefoot’s imprint was painful, so I shut up. Everyone else seemed to accept thephenomenon without trouble, and gazed at the Cheik as he began to move in astrange manner.He looked to the left, mumbling something incoherent, then to the right, sayingthe same incomprehensible things, repeating the sequence twice.Then he lifted his hands as if in prayer, in the manner shared by both Jews andMuslims. Touching his chest and pushing his hands in front of him, he said, “Ahlan, ahalan, ahlan, ahalan, bee salamah .”The letters were still glowing in front of him in the air, and he added, “ Asma’oo hoosmah ath sab’ha .”I turned and pinched Taj, whispering feverishly, “Explain!” “Don’t you know anything?” said Taj. “These are the names of seven Afrits. Theyare going to open the gate of the underworld for us.”“But…” He stomped on my foot again to shut me up, and it really hurt and I keptquiet.The Cheik said, rather loudly: “ Bakhooor, bakhooor !” A man appeared out ofnowhere and brought an incense holder. The Cheik moved it back and forth, theroom filled with smoke, and everyone started to chant and mumble very loudly.I understood nothing at all of what they said. It seemed they were speaking intongues, and the effect was frightening. They went on for a couple of minutes,then stopped abruptly. At that instant, the letters pulled together, became oneshining ball of light of intense silver color, and zoomed out of the room intothin air.One of the people opened the shutters and the late afternoon light streamed in.The Cheik put his right hand on his heart and said “Thank you” three times.I was wondering who exactly he was thanking, and who, originally, was he prayingfor, since he never used the words God, Allah, or any other recognizable deityname. I did not realize at the time that the Ulema, even when they were Arabs,where not Muslims, and had their own, very different, world view.The Master got up. Everyone rose with him, their robes swishing and making afaint sound in the quiet room. The Tuareg floated in the air. I looked at him,doing my best to control my discomfort. His upper body was solid, but the bottomhalf of the robe was obviously empty as it swirled around him, making theabsence of his lower body extremely and disturbingly clear. He seemed like anapparition, a ghost.Everyone came to the Master, bowed to him, and then grabbed his hand with bothof theirs, in a way that was clearly ceremonial.The right hand’s thumb was hitting the spot between the thumb and first fingerof the left hand, and then the left hand covered the right hand. The Tuareg floated near the master and did the same thing. Everyone looked ateach other and thanked each other a few times, following their thanks with thewords “ Rama Ahaab .” I did not know this word, and was not aware that they werespeaking Ana’kh, the language that was shared by the Anunnaki and the Ulema.And yet I sensed that there was something very special about the way they spoke,as if by instinct. I was staring at the people and trying to understand theirwords until the Master tapped me on the shoulder and told me to come out. Taj left with me, and said, “You talk too much. You should be paying moreattention, such an occasion is not likely to happen again!” I shrugged, but Ihad to admit to myself that he was right, these events were probably unique.To my surprise, I was beginning to like the Sudanese, and no longer feltthreatened by his strange appearance and bizarre behavior.“Won’t you tell me a bit about the Afrit?” I asked, licking my lollipop. “I amnot sure why we need to call them. Why can’t we just go into the undergroundcity? I don’t quite understand anything that is going on here.”“In your home, in France, do you have a Jaras , a bell, on your door?” he asked.“Yes, of course,” I said, surprised at the question.“Well, you see, the underground city do not have a Jaras, and it is locked. Ifyou want to come in, someone must let you in. The Afrit can help you, but youhave to call them in a special way. Otherwise, they don’t know you want them toopen the door. How would they know? They are not too clever.”“Where is the door?” I said.He pointed to the ground. “Under you, under the house, there is a door. Rightunder the Cheik’s house. A door to the Aboo , the deep abyss. It is also calledDahleeth , meaning an underground labyrinth.”“Are there other doors?”“Very likely, but I only know this one.” *** *** *** [Image00020.gif] Hajarat Al Houblah in Baalbeck.

Legend has it that these legendary stones wereused by the Anunnaki as launching pads for their Merkabah (Spaceships). ____________________ As if reading my mind, he put his hand in the inner pocket of his ill fittingand flashy jacket, pulled out two lollipops, and handed me one. One of the people came out of the house, motioned to us to come in, and said,“We are ready.” In the house, everyone was wearing a white robe, and to mysurprise, their heads were covered with the type of head scarf Jews sometimeswore in the synagogue. To confuse the issue even further, one was holding ascroll that resembled a Torah.I felt desperate. Were they going to delay our journey again and start praying?I really wanted move on, see the Afrit, have the adventure. I was tired of thedelays. Thankfully, one of them handed me a robe and commanded me to go changemy clothes, which I did, but Taj did not change his attire.I asked him why he was not required to do so, and he explained that he was notone of the Al Moomawariin , or the enlightened ones, so he was not required towear the special outfit.This did not really clarify the matter, since I was not one of the enlightenedones either, but I decided to let it pass.Taj seemed to be right about the door being under the Cheik’s house, because westarted to descend the steps to the basement. The basement was long and narrow,and had a very high ceiling, perhaps the height of two stories. Everything,floor, walls, ceiling, were made entirely of gray cement. It smelled ofdampness, and was very cold. We went through a one room after another, all narrow and long, eventuallyreaching a small room that had an iron gate by its far wall. The Cheik openedthe gate with a large key, and behind it was a second door, made of thick wood.A second key opened this one. Suddenly a thought struck me.Why did he need a key?Why couldn’t a man who had such supernatural powers simply command the doors toopen? Or pass through them like a ghost, for that matter? I expressed my thought to Taj. “It won’t work,” said Taj. “Yes, of course theCheik could pass through doors, but how would he take you with him?”“What do you mean?” I asked, bewildered.“You are not enlightened as yet. You cannot use supernatural means oftransportation at this stage, so if he wants you, or me, for that matter, topass through these doors, he must take you inside in a normal way. If he tried,you will just bang against the doors and hurt yourself, while he would be on theother side.” I began to see that Taj was not stupid at all. Childish, andsometimes pretending to be silly and play silly games, but deep down, he wasextremely knowledgeable.We stood together in the small room, exactly like all the other rooms in thebasement. The Cheik said, “Let the boy be the last one. He needs protection.Taj, come here.”Taj joined him at the front of the line, and we entered a long corridor. As wewere walking, the corridor began to shift its shape.I felt seasick, nauseated, my balance was lost. The floor, and walls, everythingwas moving, rolling, undulating.I did not see clearly, and wondered how long this torment would last, whensuddenly all movement stopped.I looked around and nearly jumped with terror. The simple corridor became acave!A natural cave, not a man made structure.Stone, dirt, and natural formations were all around me. It smelled damp andfilthy, water were oozing from some of the walls, and the light was dim. I didnot like the place. The Master told everyone except me to stand in a crescent shaped row, and holdhands. He ordered me to stand behind the crescent, and not to touch anyone. Iwas hurt. I felt neglected, as if I were not part of the group, until one of thepeople turned to me and said kindly, “Don’t be upset, my boy. This is for yourprotection.”So I just stood there behind the people, feeling silly in my long white robe,but not unhappy anymore. At that moment, Taj made a sweeping motion with his hands and body, and screameda few words. The horrible sound he emitted was not human. It was very likely theloudest sound I had ever heard.He continued to move his hands violently, grabbed some dirt from the ground, andthrew it up in the air. He pronounced a word that to me sounded like a name, andfollowed it by the word “ Eehdar !” three times.Then he said, “ Oodkhool ,” three times. Immediately, a rubbery kind of formmoved to the left, changed to a paste-like substance, and attached itself likeglue to the wall. The sticky, pale mess looked like ectoplasm.Taj repeated his actions a few times, manifesting a new ectoplasmicmanifestation on the wall with each call. Then, he looked at the Cheik and said,“ Tamam !” The Cheik and Taj were engaged in a conversation in low voices. They seemed tobe in agreement, since the Cheik said, “Yes, go ahead.” Taj advanced toward theectoplasmic forms, put his hand in his jacket’s pocket and took something out,and gave some to each of them.At this moment, the Cheik stepped forward, ready to take over, and said “Iibriiz !” The forms burst into flame, which burned the ectoplasm and produced athick fog. From the fog appeared human forms, but there were only six of them.The Cheik said “ Wawsabeh !” The Master came forward, stood by the Cheik, andthe Cheik repeated the word, adding, “ Anna a’mooree khum !” and the seventhcreature came. Later Taj told me that these Afrit were originally created by the Cheik for areason, as they usually are, and in the normal state of events were supposed tobecome the Cheik’s loyal servants.However, the Cheik made a mistake and did not perform the exact requirementsneeded in the procedure of the creation, and therefore he lost control over theAfrit.The result was disturbing. The seven Afrit developed independent and rather evil habits, and did not quiteobey the Cheik as they should. For some reason, the only one who could call themto appear was Taj.However, that is all he could do. Since Taj was not an Enlightened One, he couldnot control them once they came, and to a certain extent was at their mercy andhad to have an Ulema present if he were to avoid potential harm.As for another Ulema controlling them instead of Taj and the Cheik, that was notpossible. The Ulema have four categories, based on their form of existence. SomeUlema are physical and live as humans, like the Master and the Cheik. Some usedto be physical, but were no longer so. Some, like the Tuareg, straddled both forms. Others have never occupied a humanform. All four versions of the Ulema can exercise immense powers, no matter ifthey are physical or non physical, but a physical Ulema can only control nonphysical entities, such as these Afrits, if he was their creator.I shuddered as I watched the Afrit. At this point of my studies, I had my shareof supernatural incidences, but I have never been so shaken before. In the semidarkness of this miserable, damp place, the Afrits were truly terrifying.Each had a more or less human face, but in this almost normal face the eyes werenot at all normal. Instead, each Afrit had two circular orbs, with whitebackground and a black pupil that stood out as if painted. The eyes did notmove. If the Afrit wanted to look to the side, it had to move its whole head. The headwas not connected to the body. Instead, it floated in a disconcerting, eeriefashion, just above the body. When the Afrit manifest, their bodies often appearfirst and for a few minutes appears headless, until they choose to manifest thehead.This fact, coupled by their appalling ugliness, can frighten a human being tothe point of death. There had been recorded incidents of people dying of heartattack or stroke caused by such events. I kept myself as calm as possible and continued to study the Afrit. The headswere bad enough, but the bodies were even worse.They were tinted a shadowy, ugly, dark color. The torso resembled the shape of abat. Their arms were attached to the back of the body, and the hands hadextremely long fingers. Since the Afrit don’t eat or breathe, they don’t need astomach and a diaphragm.Therefore, the body had a sort of visible cavity in the front, where theseorgans would have been. The legs were twisted, like entangled wires, which musthelp the Afrit as they jump. They rarely stay in one place for long, and keepshaking and moving and twitching.They looked back at us, their ugly faces twisted in a devilish, vicious smile.They kept chattering among themselves and pointing at us with their longfingers.But Taj told me that despite their apparent boldness, they were afraid of theEnlightened Ones. Any Afrit can see the shining auras of the Ulema, and for somereason they are terrified of these auras.The Cheik commanded the Afrit to open the door. I did not understand thelanguage he spoke, but I figured it out because he used the word “ Babu ,” whichis so similar to the word Ba’ab . Babu is really a door, though, while ba’ab isa gate, but the words were close enough to make it clear to me that they weregoing to open the door to the underground world.I was speechless with anticipation. Everyone stood still, looking at the farwall of the cave, so I stared at it too, not knowing what to expect.The far wall of the cave suddenly collapsed, in total silence. It felt like asilent movie, because there was no dust and no sound of falling stones duringthe procedure.The stones tumbled down quietly, one by one, disappearing altogether rather thanforming a solid pile.The wall was replaced by dark, hazy fog, that allowed us a glimpse of some faraway buildings. “Now,” said the Cheik to Taj, “Let’s follow the Afrit, but don’tlet them play tricks on you.” Taj nodded. We went through the fog, following another corridor and crossingidentical rooms that seemed to follow each other in succession, all the whileseeing the far off buildings in the distance.The Cheik started reciting something.The Afrit were jumping up and down like carousel horses, while pushing forwardwith great speed, and were already a good distance away from us, going on theirown mysterious errands.Taj said to me, “You can now move to the front, it’s safe now, the Afrit won’tpay much attention to us anymore.” I quickly moved near the Master at the headof the line, and no one took notice of what I was doing. We did not move on yet.The Cheik asked Taj to show him a piece of paper he was holding, probably a kindof a map, and asked, “Do you know which room we need?”“Yes,” said Taj. “I know exactly where it is, it’s very near us. I will go in,and if I find something, I will bring some pieces back to you so you can seethem, and then we can all go in and bring everything.”Taj left for about five minutes, and returned with a beautiful pearl necklace, afew diamonds, and some Phoenician coins.He told the Cheik and the Master, “We can go in now, but remember, you promisedthat all the gold belongs to Taj.”“Of course,” said the Cheik casually. “But remember,” said the Master, “We arenot just going into the treasure room. You will also take us to the other room,as you promised.”It was clear to me that the Ulema were not in the least interested in thetreasure, but there was something else in this underground cavern that meantmuch more to them than any gold or diamonds.The Ulema do not need gold. They can manufacture whatever wealth they need, andthey never manufacture or acquire more than they need. Riches are of no interestto them at all.“Certainly I will take you to the other room,” said Taj. “I know exactly whereit is.” He seemed quite pleased by the bargain. We followed Taj into a small, closed room. It had no windows but was brightlylit, allowing us to see gold, gems, diamonds, and pearls stashed in boxes, jars,or simply thrown on the floor in heaps. However, I was not very interested ingold either.What I wondered about was the source of the mysterious illumination. No windows,no lamps, no candles, but bright light in every corner of the room. What couldcause this?Suddenly I realized it had to be the same type of light that was discovered inthe Pharaonic tombs and catacombs of ancient Egypt. Originally, the archaeologists who went there were baffled by the light in theEgyptian tunnels, until they discovered the contraption that the ancientEgyptians had created. They found conical objects that functioned like modernbatteries, producing light that was so much like normal electrical light thatthere was hardly a difference.The batteries had to be placed in a certain way against each other, or theywould not light, and worse, could burn the user since they packed a lot ofenergy in their structure. I suspected this had to be the same type ofillumination.Taj pointed the door that would take us to the room the Master wished to visit.The Master asked him, “Do you want to come with us?”“I will follow you as soon as I am finished here,” said Taj, grinning. He pulledsome linen bags from under his jacket, and busily started filling them with thetreasure.The Master smiled indulgently at him, as if Taj was a child playing with sometoys that meant little to adults but pleased the child a great deal. He said tothe rest of us, “Well then, let’s go to the next room.”We opened the door. Inside it was pitch black, but the Master stepped in withoutthe slightest hesitation, and we followed. I envied his confidence.As far as I was concerned, how did we know an angry Afrit was not waiting forus? But since no one else showed any fear, I went with them. We could see nothing,but the Master kept talking to us and so we were able to follow him. All ofsudden, bright light filled the room.I blinked a few times, and then saw the Master standing by one of the walls,holding two conical, golden objects in each hand, positioned against each other.I was right, here were the ancient batteries.The room was empty of furniture other than a beautiful wooden table, carved intoarabesques, much like Moroccan furniture.The Master placed the batteries carefully on the table, making sure thealignment allowed them to continue to produce light. I looked around. Other thanthe batteries and the table, the only object in the room was a large Phoenicianurn, standing in one of the corners.“We are going to leave you here for a short while,” said the Master to thegroup. “The Cheik and I are going to get the materials we need for our project.”“We’ll be right back,” added the Cheik with what seemed to me rather misguidedoptimism. There were Djinn and Afrit here! Wasn’t anyone concerned about thesedevils?The Master and the Cheik walked to the end of the room, very slowly, withmeasured, matching steps, as if choreographed. Then they reached the far wall,and literally went through the wall to the other side.I was not exactly shocked, since I have seen the Master go through walls before.It is an interesting phenomenon, but not as mysterious as one might think.To put it simply, the Ulema know how to control molecules; the Master hadexplained it to me thoroughly. Everyone knows that there is plenty of emptyspace between the molecules of any matter, and the Ulema make use of that factwith a specialized procedure.As the person who wishes to cross approaches the wall, the wall graduallybecomes soft, as if its molecules fragment themselves, and the human bodysimultaneously does the same. The spaces between the molecules of both grow and readjust. The person and thewall keep their shapes for an instant, then their molecules mingle and allow thepassage.At that moment, the person passes to the other side, the molecules separate, andboth wall and person become solid and normal again.The rest of us waited for about half an hour. I was beginning to worry. TheCheik said they would be right back! Something must have prevented them fromdoing so.Perhaps the Afrit, who has by now completely disappeared, took them away,kidnapped them, led them somewhere horrible? I asked some of the other people ifthey knew what was going on, but they had no idea where the Cheik and the Masterwent.However, they did not seem worried, making it clear to me that they trustedthese two to know what to do. “Don’t worry,” one of them said to me. “They canhandle a lot worse than those stupid Afrits.”“I don’t wish to contradict, Sir,” I said, “but these Afrit seem prettydangerous to me. The way they were pointing and smiling…” The others laughed. “Ihave seen the Cheik and the Master handle much worse entities,” said the man whospoke to me, very kindly. “Remember, the Afrist are cowards. They are mortallyafraid of the auras of the Ulema.”“But I understand the Cheik needs some help because of the way he handled theircreation,” I said.“Yes, this is true,” said the man. “These Afrit did turn out a bit wild. Butwith the Master there, they will never dare to harm them.” I had to be contentwith that. So I went in search of Taj, to see how he was doing with thetreasure, perhaps help him finish filling his bags.I called him and was about to reenter the room, but I heard him scream, “Don’tcome here!” and he tumbled out of the room, bleeding, and slammed the doorbehind him. “The Afrit beat me,” he gasped. “Beat me very badly.”“But Taj, you could handle those seven Afrit so well! What happened to give thempower over you?” “Seven? Are you joking? There is a colony here, something like forty of fiftyAfrit, and they all rushed at me and would not let me take the gold.”“Is it their gold?” I asked. “What do they want it for, anyway? They don’t needmoney.”“No, it’s not their gold. It used to belong to the Phoenicians, and now itbelongs to no one in particular. But the Afrit like to play with it. They likeshining things.”“But you are holding one bag, I see.”“Yes, I managed to save one bag. They got all the others, those slimy devils.”He smiled, regaining his composure. “Never mind, though. After all, I will be avery wealthy man even with just one bag. This treasure is amazing… Anyway, wemust secure the door. Hold the bag for a minute.” He pushed the bag in my hands,turned, and repeated the same words he used when he originally called the Afrit,and gestured in the same way.While he was doing that, I heard shrieks and screams, which he later explainedwas the way the Afrit spoke as they were chased away. “That is that,” he said,surveying the door with satisfaction. “They won’t bother us again.” He took thebag and smiled at me through the caked blood and filth on his face. “Asuccessful treasure hunt, ah, Germain? And some day I’ll come back for more.” Back in the other room, I saw, to my considerable relief, that the Cheik and theMaster have returned. The Cheik was holding a stack of forty or fifty sheetsmade of shiny plastic, or plasma, or glass, and the Master had the same sizestack, but of a different type of material, brownish yellow like corn.“What is that?” I asked Taj.“I have no idea,” said Taj. “They only told me which room I was supposed to takethem to, but they did not tell me what project they were engaged in. I must sayI have a hunch it is something terribly important.” I thought so too, since theCheik and the Master seemed to be extremely solemn, and everyone else wascompletely silent. There was a strong feeling of expectation in the room. They each put his stack on the table, the Cheik on the right, the Master on theleft, leaving a space between the stacks, and I noticed that the space matchedthe size of the stacks.The Master brought the urn from the corner to the table, and made a motion ofpouring something out of the urn into the space between the stacks. I sawnothing coming out of the jar, but I figured that it might be an invisiblesubstance.This went on for about twenty seconds, then the Master returned the urn to thecorner. The Cheik took one sheet from his stack, and put it in the space betweenthe stacks. The Master then took a sheet from his own stack, put it on theCheik’s sheet, and waited a couple of seconds.Then the Master flipped his sheet back side up, and to my absolute amazement,there was print on the sheet, strong and black, consisting of strange symbolsand letters I did not recognize.Piling the sheets on top of each other, they did the same to all of them.Surprisingly, the stack, when finished, was reduced in size to about a half ofthe original sheets, even though I could not see it reducing itself while it wasworked on. I think that the plasma sheets were absorbed into the corn-like paperas the print was produced, but I am not sure. The Cheik pulled out a silk scarffrom his robe, put the stack on the scarf, rolled it, lifted the ends of thescarf and tied them together, all in a ritualistic way. Then he said, “ Al Hamdu” twice. They turned to go, and we left the room. The Master, throughout the entire time,paid hardly any attention to me, which bothered me a little. I felt neglected,even abandoned. He must have noticed my unhappy face, because he put his hand onmy shoulder, took me back into the room, and said, “Look!” To my amazement, theroom was entirely empty. The table and the urn had disappeared.I was confused and uncomfortable.I could not understand why all that was necessary.Why Afrit? Why those doors?Where did the table go? What was this document and why was it worth all this effort? He laughed at myquestions and said, “Look at the wall.” The light was dimming as we spoke, andfinally disappeared. It seemed this adventure was over, and I said,rebelliously, that I wish things were made clear to me, because otherwise, Ihave learned nothing.I will explain everything later, Germain. I promise”“But what about the city you said we are about to see?The city where the Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to come to?The city from before the Deluge?”“So you want to see more? This was not enough?”“Yes,” I said. “Basically, all I saw was you and the Cheik going through a walland Taj fighting with the Afrit, which I admit were scary but were not toosignificant, I believe. I did not see anything remotely connected to the ancientcity.”“Well,” he said, “in this case, turn, and walk with me. You are already walkingin this city.”I looked around, and saw nothing, but he said, “Keep walking, it will come.”I should have trusted him more fully. After all, when did he ever disappoint me?I felt remorseful as the miracle began to enfold in front of my eyes, butthankfully, he did not hold my short term rebellion against me, and went oncheerfully enough.Slowly, the ancient city started to appear like a Polaroid picture in front ofme. The colors of the city were such as I have never seen before, glowing colorsof incredible beauty.The Master explained that this was because the city was located in a space thathad the same temperature everywhere, and no pressure on any object. Unlikeearth.“What do you mean, Master, when you say ‘unlike earth’ like that? Are we not onearth?”“No, we have left earth when the Afrit opened the door and made the cave wallcollapse. We are now in another dimension,” said the Master. “Everything looks alittle different here.” The city became clearer, and I thought it looked like aholographic projection, either from the past, or from the future. The buildings, though beautiful, had a sense of alien, remote places.We were now walking in a well-illuminated street, the windows of the buildingsshining with lights as well. The air was soft and fragrant.“I see buildings and streets,” I said. “But where are the people?”“They are here, but they are invisible to you. Your eyes are not constructed tosee them, not yet,” he said.“Well, it is time to leave. Let’s go up these stairs.” We started climbing avery high, stone stairway that led from the street into a destination that wasnot quite visible.I was surprised that we were not retracing out steps into the Cheik’s house, butthe Master said there was no need for that, and that exits were available invarious locations, and not as difficult to achieve as entrances.So we climbed the stairs, and when we reached the top, I saw a huge gray wall onmy left, and noticed that the pavement turned into sand. The huge gray wall was the side of the Anunnaki stone.I understood that we exited from a hole under the big stone, were out of thestrange dimension, and back on earth.“So that is what Taj meant when he said he would make the stone fly?” I said.“Yes, a rather poetic way of describing our trip,” said the Master.“Master, I am not wearing the white robe! I am wearing the normal clothes I leftat the Cheik’s house.”“Indeed, and so is everyone else,” he said, pointing to the rest of the company,who were already standing near the giant stone, and wearing normal clothes.“So what did we come here for? Surely not just to give Taj his treasure?”“We came for the book, Germain. Everything we did was much worth it, even theencounter with the unpleasant and stupid Afrit. We have recently heard that the book was here, in this dimension, after havingsearched for it unsuccessfully for generations. And now we have recovered a copyof the most important book in the world.”“The strange book you printed from the stacks? What is it?”“It is one of the very few copies in existence of what is probably the oldestbook to have ever been written. A book the Anunnaki had valued very much. It iscalled The Book of Rama Dosh .”I didn’t know why, but a shiver went through my spine when I heard the name ofthe Ancient book; the sound of the name triggered a reaction in my mind. For asecond I had a feeling of tottering on the brink of a dark, warm abyss thatcontained something older than the universe, and glowed with endless stars. Itpassed quickly, and the Master continued.“In the future, you will have the privilege of studying it. It contains theknowledge that may, some day, save humanity from its own folly. At least I hopeso with all my heart. And now, back to Damascus! Our friendly driver is waitingfor us in the car .” - From the book “On the Road to Ultimate Knowledge”,co-authored by Maximillien de Lafayette and Ilil Arbel.

Baalbeck and “Beit al Jin ”: At one time, a large community of lower entities called “Beit al Jin” (House ofthe Djinns) strived underground near the ruins of the Roman temples of Baalbeck.The Beit was guarded by three principal djinns who shape-shifted constantly,during their first contact (Apparition) with human beings.According to a local legend, some of these lower entities were the remnants ofthe Afarit who have served King Solomon.One of the entrances leading to their Beit, was situated under the massive stoneof “Hajarat Al Houblah.”Note: Beit means house in Hebrew and Arabic, Bitu and Bita in Phoenician, andseveral other ancient Middle Eastern languages.
