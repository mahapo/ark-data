Statement:I do believe that the people and abductees I interviewed were truthful.They did tell the truth.However, I felt that in some cases, some of them were confused, because theywere exposed to circumstances and encounters, they could not understand and/orcope with.I needed more evidence and corroborations from other sources. And I found thebest source pertaining to this matter in the work of Dr. David Jacobs, who is aworld leading authority in the field.Dr. Jacobs studied the topics of alien abduction in depth and at length, andinterviewed hundreds of abductees.Upon consulting his work and reading the answers of the abductees heinterviewed, I found outstanding corroborations to statements and reports givento me by the people and abductees I have interviewed, and wrote about in thisbook.Consequently, I asked Carol Lexter, a dear associate who edited a few books ofmine, to contact Dr. Jacobs and ask his permission to use some of his findings,and particularly the interviews he had with his subjects. Carol wrote to Dr.Jacobs, and obtained his permission to do so. Dr. Jacobs authorized us toreprint articles he authored, including the ones you see in this section. Permission was granted in his email dated: 12/09/2007. Dr. Jacobs’ e-mailaddress: David M. Jacobs djacobs@temple.edu [djacobs@temple.edu]Contents of his e-mail:“Dear Ms. Lexter,Thank you for your kind words. You have my permission to reprint articles thatyou think are relevant.Best Wishes,David Jacobs”Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ From the work/writings of Dr. David Jacobs.Herewith reproduced with his permission. As is and unedited. For Terry Matthews, the catastrophic scene ended with happy hybrids strolling ina peaceful setting. First the aliens directed her attention to a screen on whichshe saw a large explosion:It looks like a mushroom cloud from the top. That's what it looked like.Is it earth, or some other planet?I don't know, I could just see the bomb. Just the explosion...It was realbrilliant and puffs of white cloud and I know it wasn't in my head. It was up onthe screen.What else do you see up there as you sit there?For a minute I thought I saw armies and crashed planes.Armies, like foot soldiers marching forward and I saw a crashed plane and then Isaw a field with nothing growing in it, not even weeds, just bare. Just saw alittle girl with puffy cheeks…standing next to a wall. She looks very poor.Looking very angry and lonely. It was just a flash image though, it was veryfast. These images aren't very long.Do you hear any sound with them?I don't think so. Although with the explosion at the beginning, I almost feltthe vibration of it even though it was just an image. It startled me though soit might have been just my adrenaline. I don't know, but I don't hear any sound.I feel like I hear a gray talking in his…you know, not talking.Thinking. Kind of like voiceover.What is the gray sort of thinking, or can you get a sense of that?Yeah, but it sounds hokey. Like, \"This is going to happen.\" That's not thewords. \"Inevitable,\" that's the word I hear. That's the way it translates. And Ifeel like I'm watching propaganda.... I feel like it's, like when you're a kidand they threaten, \"You better be good or Santa Claus won't bring you anything,\"you know? That's the feel of it. But I don't know what they want from me. Idon't know why they want me to see this. What's the next image you see up there? Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ It was real fast. The first one was like as far as the eye could see, it wasbarren and dead, you know? Not dead people, just dead earth, I guess. Dead soil.No trees, no buildings and then all of a sudden I started to see pretty fields,flowers and…hybrids.What are the hybrids doing?The scene looks happy.The hybrids are happy?Well, contented or...I feel a nice day.What are they doing?Walking, everybody's moving kind of slowly and peacefully, even the children.Looks like an alien greeting card. That's what it looks like. It's propaganda, Iknow it is...Just like it's a garden of some kind...It reminds me of...the waythey're walking in pairs very slowly…like they're having a leisurely Sundayafternoon, you know? Like it's perfect or something...It's like a very hugegarden that goes on and on and on.During Allison Reed's five-day abduction, she witnessed many scenes ofdevastation. The aliens told her that during a future period of human strife,they will intercede and save us from ourselves.Roxanne's Zeigler's experience ended with optimism. She saw army people inuniforms and then there was an explosion. And then I see a bomb going off. It'slike a mushroom. It's kind of, like everything's like turning black and white.And the color is all gone. It's like sheer desolation. And a raging fire treesburned, and animals running.People with like black, blistered skin…kind of nothingness, just smoldering. Andeverything's all quiet and still black and white. The sun is coming out, and avague whiteness is like covering the land. There's like…something I've heardbefore.What's that?It's like, \"All's well that ends well.\" It's like there's this voice coming outof the sky, and this brightness envelops the earth. And the darkness is goingaway, and the desolation is going away.And the grass is growing. And there's some butterflies that are coming out. Andthe flowers are growing. And, it's like luminous beings. It's almost likeangelic figures around and all in light.Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ And the people are moving around and doing all kinds of things. And people aresmiling again. Everybody looks healthy and strong. And children are playinggames outside. The animals look content. And the forest is green.There are ships, lots of ships. And all these people are coming out of theships. It's like people are greeting each other, and they're kind of like, okay,back to business, so to speak, you know. There are a lot of ships arriving, andpeople are coming out from the ships, almost as if some of them had been herebefore It's like they've been away a while, but it's like they're coming home.When they come out of the ships, how do they look?Do they look just like normal people?They're not wearing the same clothes that we wear. They're coming out with likethis luminous cloth...But, they're all different colors, like all differentraces.They're taking these beings to, and it's like they're showing them around...It'slike there's no fear of them or anything. I get the feeling, though, that these- the ones that are still, still look alien - they still can't live here. I guess they can stay for short periods of time, then they have to at least goto their ships or something. But, there are parts of them that are with usbecause they have all these other people that are a mixture. Things won't goback the way they were things will be better. There will be a lot differenttechnology, and people can utilize their gifts. People will learn to get alongbetter, at least these people have.There is more respect for the earth and all that's living. And, there is morelove and acceptance…more opportunity to realize good potential. The screen isfading. This person who is standing beside me seems to be saying that, you know,\"Don't worry, it won't be so bad as it looks. We just had to test youremotions.\" There will be changes, and it won't be so bad. They are not causing the changesto take place on the earth, but something's coming.He says that we need them. They have to make people like them that can survivein our society.Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ We need what they have to offer. In other words, we might have an awful timetrying to recover, and their being here will make things easier for us not to beafraid.Now, he says something is coming. Does he say what's coming, or not? He saysit'll be made clear as times goes by. He says what they are doing is necessary.It has to be done, and they're not trying to hurt us in any way.But, some of the things may hurt - they try to take away the pain. They try tomake the memories go because the memories give us trouble here with the people,and it's not time yet. But eventually all will be all right. It'll all becomeclear. If these accounts of salvation are true, then the aliens' message is clear:After the catastrophe, whatever it is, takes place, the late-stage hybrids andperhaps the aliens themselves will engage in a general integration into humansociety. As one hybrid told Claudia Negron, \"Soon all life will be changed.People will be different.\" Presumably, we will all live in peace and harmony.The environment will be healthy and there will be no more war or conflict. From another passage:Christine Kennedy observed a \"town\" inhabited by hybrids that was threatened bya flood. She knew the hybrid babies there would die if they were not rescued,and she felt sorrow at the prospect and guilt that she could not save them.Charles Petrie received the idea through a visualization that a colony of alienswas living at the bottom of the sea and that their cable lifeline was notfunctioning properly He envisioned himself diving with others to fix the cableand rescue the aliens. In Allison Reed's envisioned scene of devastation, she rescued a baby amid theexplosions, smoke, rubble, charred bodies, and wounded survivors reaching out toher. Unknown people chased her as she ran with the baby down a path to a whitelight and was finally safe. After that vision, she felt safe with the aliens andglad that she was part of their program. The aliens told her, \"It's in thefuture.\"Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ Facilitating:Some abductees indicate that they themselves will smooth the way for The Change.They do not know specifically what they will do, but they think they will knowwhen the time comes. The aliens told Pam Martin that when the world changes,they will call upon her to help people adapt to the new reality.They're telling me things of the future....What are they telling you?I can't tell if they're putting me on or what. This sounds really nuts. It'slike they're explaining things to me, preparing me for a time when I'll have alot of responsibility. But I don't have to worry about anything, it's likethey'll be there to guide me, to tell me what to do.What context? How do they mean that?Well, it has something to do with teaching other people things. They tell mepeople will be listening to me. I think I'm thinking with two minds because I'mthinking then and I'm thinking now. At the time I was listening to them, goingalong with it. Right now I'm thinking this is really nuts.What else did they say you're going to wind up doing?Just that they're preparing me. But they don't say preparing me for what....So you're teaching people things and they're going to listen and all that?Yeah.What will you be teaching people?About the new life, after the world changes. Helping people adapt. And right nowthey're preparing me to accept the unacceptable.Okay. What do they mean by \"after the world changes\"?Do they explain what kind of change? Do they give you a sense of that?Well, the world won't be like we're accustomed to it. They'll be here.Other abductees feel that they will have specific roles to perform to facilitatethe onset of The Change when the time comes. During a Mindscan procedure with aninsect-like alien, Reshma Kamal was told that she was \"one of them.\"Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ When she protested and said she was not one of them, the insect-like alien toldher \"a plan is going to take place and I would be in it that way.\" She was shownimages in which she acted as a traffic director to help move panicked anddistraught crowds of people through the streets to a central location. Those whowere non-abductees would be confused and frightened, the alien explained, butshe would not be. She was \"part of the plan.\"Facilitating The Change may explain why abductees feel infused with mysteriousknowledge. For years many of them have been saying that the aliens have giventhem knowledge but that they cannot bring it to mind. Hypnosis rarely works torecover this knowledge. The aliens tell the abductees that the memories will berecovered when \"it is time.\"In typical fashion they told Steve Thompson, an apartment house maintenancesupervisor, something he knew was important but would not be able to rememberbecause \"it is not yet time to know.\"Patti Layne's knowledge was linked to a possible implant. She was told she wouldlearn later what it was about:He started saying something to me, but I can't tell you what it is.You can't remember, you mean?I can't remember it. It's like it's a secret, but I can't remember what it is.Something to do with what he put in me. He said it would be there, somethingabout in time this will serve a purpose. It will tell you what to do when it'stimeDo you know what this means?It seemed to make sense at the moment, but it doesn't now. It kind of left mewith the feeling that it was extremely important, some grand plan.Carla Enders was eight years old when an alien told her something was impossiblefor her to bring to mind. Recalling the experience as an eight-year-old, she hadtrouble verbalizing the mechanism of telepathy and what an alien was tellingher: Like it's just not real. Like how can it [the alien] be talking to me in myhead? And I can't really understand what it's saying to me in my head. Likeanother language or something. Like maybe, it's putting things in my head, andlater I'll hear it. I don't know, like a recording or something.Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ But that I can't understand it right now. It's like it's storing something in myhead, whatever it's saying to me. Like it's almost saying to me, that I won'tunderstand what it's saying to me. Like it's telling me I won't understand it.It's not time for me to understand it. But someday I'll understand it. But it'sstill in my head. Whatever it is. Whatever he said, is in my head.It's in your head at the time when you're eight years old?Yes.She then visualized images of aliens dying. They were on the ground outside andlying on the floor in various rooms. She thought that other abductees in theroom with her were seeing the same thing.Allison Reed was told that there would be many changes in the future and shewould know what to do.He's talking about the future.There's going to be a lot of changes. And there's going to be a lot ofunsettling and turmoil....I'm to understand that it's my cooperation with themis…I'm going to know what to do. I have a safety valve. I don't get it, I don'tknow what's going to happen, and he's not being specific. There's just something, my sense is on a global scale. In the future, I don'tknow how far. It may not even be, something, he's just letting me know thatthere's going to be something, and it's going to be horrible, but that I'll knowwhat to do. And that I'll just know, they've been teaching me. He doesn't usethe word programming, but that's how I can describe it.They've been programming me, whatever it is, something's going to happen and Ineedn't worry because I have the information though I don't know.I have the information and I'm going to know what to do and that all of whatthey do to me has something to do with preparing me, as well as themselves, forwhatever this is that's going to happen.Something is going to happen; it's going to be catastrophic. It's in the future,whatever that means, and I'm going to know what to do and that information'scoming to me from my experiences. Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ The unsettling conclusion is, of course, that abductees are \"trained\" and\"prepared\" for later events and it is in this context that the puzzling primaryexperiences of staging and testing can be understood.Some of these procedures may be part of the training program that abducteesbegin as small children. In the staging procedure, abductees are required toparticipate in a \"theatrical\" production which is a combination of envisioningand playacting. Susan Steiner witnessed another woman abducted scream and runaround the room out of control.Suddenly the panicked woman ran into a wall and was accidentally stabbed by asharp instrument protruding from it. She fell to the floor bleeding. Susan wastold to go to her and try to help. Distraught, Susan went to the unfortunatewoman and when she bent down she realized that the woman was actually a grayalien. The entire affair had been staged.In testing procedures, abductees are required to operate special devices thatindicate that they have received specialized knowledge of operating theequipment, or they are required to perform seemingly impossible mental taskslike viewing something through the eyes of an alien.Claudia Negron was told that time is short: One of them is talking to me.What is he saying?He's saying that I am helping them and that l should feel proud of that. They'rehappy with me, and that I'm helping them a lot. They say they need to do this,they have to do this, and that I should be happy I'm a part of this. They can'ttell exactly what it is right now, but they will later. At another time they'lltell me.They'll tell you what it is?They'll tell me what it is, and they'll show me. They'll take me there and showme, but right now they can't. It's almost complete but not yet. There is morethey have to do…So he says that it's almost complete, but not quite, and they still have somethings to do?Well, I understand that he's talking about the future and that he's talkingabout them…their race. They have to be so secret about it. It has to be thatway, otherwise it would never work.Case studies and corroboration_________________________________________________ An alien took Roxanne Zeigler, a nurse living in New York State, to see a groupof toddlers who were playing together. Then an adult hybrid took Roxanne tovisit a late-stage toddler who was in a different playroom with climbingequipment; this toddler was dressed in human clothes. The escort said that thechild was born in 1990 and it was Roxanne's.Later the little boy showed Roxanne a special room he lived in, with ahuman-style bed that came out of the wall. He seemed proud of his possessions.Hybrid children sometimes want to play with human-style toys, but often they donot know how and need instruction.”- Source: Dr. David Jacobs. *** *** *** Intraterrestrial Grays_________________________________________________ Part FiveThe Underwater and Vacuum World of the Grays. > • The Grays and extraterrestrials’ “Corridor Plasma”…175> • Definition of “Corridor Plasma”…175> • Characteristics…175> • Location of the Corridor Plasma…176> • US military scientists and the Corridor Plasma…176> • Underwater bases…178> • Is it true that a massive Grays-Russian underwater base exists one mile deep> in the Marianas trench in the Pacific ocean?

Extraterrestrials/Grays “Corridor Plasma”______________ > • I. Definition> • II. Characteristics> • III. Location of the Corridor Plasma> • IV. US military scientists and the Corridor Plasma ________________________ I. Definition of “Corridor Plasma”:Corridor plasma is a term used to refer to underwater tunnels and passagescreated and operated by the Grays and aliens to navigate the oceans.By using these plasma tunnels, UFOs can accomplish extraordinary tasks, such as,to name a few: > • a - To reach an astonishing speed;> • b - To avoid sonar detection;> • c - To remain undetected by spy satellites;> • d - To enter and exist underwater bases. II. Characteristics:The corridor plasma is movable and mobile, meaning that aliens can place theunderwater tunnels, and displace them according to their needs, and “navigationchart”. The tunnels extend to thousands of miles underwater, and serve as a webnetwork for several alien underwater bases around the globe.Their spaceships known as USO (Unidentified Submerged Objects) use the plasmacorridors to navigate the oceans and seas. According to some, the “CorridorPlasma can be compared to a White Hole, where gravity exists no longer.Extraterrestrials’ Corridor Plasma_________________________________________________ In the White Holes, the gravity as we know it becomes a reverse gravity. Thisphenomenon allows the alien underwater crafts to attain a mind-boggling speed.” III. Location of the Corridor Plasma:Some of these bases are located in:> • a - The Bahamas> • b - The Japanese “Dragon Triangle”> • c - The north side of the so-called Bermuda Triangle> • d - Alaska> • e - Florida. IV. US military scientists and the Corridor Plasma:Allegedly, AUTEC (Atlantic Underwater Testing and Evaluation Center) isconnected to these tunnels. I am certain that the technology of the CorridorPlasma was given to American military scientists working at AUTEC, and severalother naval bases.He said, that the Grays intraterrestrials (Aliens who live on Earth) are theinventors of this astonishing technology. He added, “One of the most amazingaspects of this technology is the fact that the aliens’ underwater crafts nevertouch the water. There is a plasma shield surrounding the exterior body of thecraft.We know that plasma produces extreme heat. And this heat can melt the craft. Butthe aliens found a way to isolate the plasma heat from the body of the craft, byadding two layers of anti-plasma shields (Called Plasma Belt) to the exteriorbody of the craft. *** *** *** Extraterrestrials’ Corridor Plasma_________________________________________________ [Image00001.gif] Map of the Japanese “Dragon Triangle”. _______________________________ Underwater bases_________________________________________________ Underwater Bases_______________________ Excerpts from my book “ The Revised, Indexed and Complete Book of theAnunnaki-Ulema Final Warning to Humanity, the End of Time, and the Return of theAnunnaki in 2022.” *** *** *** Question: Is it true that a massive Grays-Russian underwater base exists onemile deep in the Marianas trench in the Pacific ocean? If so, whatactivities/research/experiments are conducted over there?Do the Chinese have one too? Answer:The “Aquatic Plasma Corridors” Yes, it is true. The Russians have a massive underwater base that was created in1969, to study an extraterrestrial underwater navigation system called “AquaticPlasma Corridors”.This corridor is undetectable by satellite, sonar or any other underwaterdetection system. Not all branches of the Russian Navy were aware of thecreation/existence of this base.During one of their naval maneuvers just outside the perimeter of this Russianunderwater base, six frogmen from one of the Russian submarines encounteredthree alien frogmen in metallic suits underneath a massive metallic object.Both the Russian and alien frogmen were roughly at a depth of one hundred to onehundred and twenty feet. The alien frogmen were 8ft to 11ft tall The alien frogmen were wearing what appeared underwater to be metallic suits ofindeterminable and interchanging colors that morphed from a silvery white tobluish to grey.Underwater bases_________________________________________________ One of the Russian frogmen stated that when he tried to approach these three, hewas blocked by what seemed to be an invisible underwater force-field, created bythe alien frogmen as a protection shield.The Russian frogman’s oxygen tanks started to fail and he quickly lostconsciousness and started sinking but was saved by one of his fellow divers.After being rescued, he described the alien frogmen as being 8ft to 11ft tall,as he saw them underwater. And none of them had any visible oxygentanks/breathing apparatus attached to them. In the secret debriefing that followed, the Russian diver who saved his fellowfrogmen, said that when he too tried to approach this massive foreign submergedobject, he encountered what felt like a solid transparent wall surrounding theobject. An oval glass box surrounded and shielded the aliens’ underwater craft He later described it as an oval glass box, surrounding this mysterioussubmerged object which also shielded it from contact with the ocean’s water.After the fall of the Berlin wall, and ensuing collapse of the Soviet Empire,rumors started circulating within the military and scientific community, thatthis bizarre event was in fact a joint Russian-extraterrestrial operationdesigned to explore the effects of the underwater plasma corridor on it’senvironment in the ocean, and on humans, as well as their psychological andpsychosomatic reaction to encountering the corridor and seeing the alien frogmenand the ship itself.Two decades later in Lake Baikal, other Russian navy frogmen encountered similar9ft “silver swimmers” who also had no visible breathing apparatus.While these encounters are largely unknown to the general public, militaryscientists with top clearance are well aware of them, and have worked on similarprojects in different underwater bases, such as the one known to us as AUTEC,which is located off Andros Island in the Bahamas. Underwater bases_________________________________________________ Massive underwater bases and joint human-alien operations These massive underwater military bases, whether they be Russian, or American orChinese, look from the surface to be rectangular/traditional compoundstructures.However upon entering them underwater, they expand in all directions, and areextremely extensive. And all of them are joint human-alien operations.Starting from the second underwater level, compartments are divided into largeoperation rooms, separated by elaborate long corridors, curving at 90 degreesevery hundred feet or so, with doors that can drop down from the ceiling to sealoff segments in the event of radiation leakage, or any matter related tointernal security. One of the interesting characteristics of these doors in the corridors is thecircular porthole-like windows within what is a whitish metal ofextraterrestrial origin.None of these metallic alloys are possible here due to earth’s gravity, and assuch have to be done in orbit aboard the Space Shuttle. Interestingly enough,this technology has been shared by American, Russian and Israeli militaryscientists. At one time British and French scientists complained of being left out of theloop, to which the Americans responded very candidly “We don’t trust Europeans –especially the French!” To which the French retorted that they would withholdall information garnered from the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn.An American three star general was quick to respond by saying “This is not thefirst time you Europeans have withheld information from us. Remember the Belgianincident?” (Aurora)The mode of transportation down to the underwater base and within the base isalso fascinating. Underwater bases_[Image00002.gif] ________________________________________________Cassini approaches Saturn (Artist's impression: NASA) .C[Image00003.gif] assini-Huygens Spacecraft .An Ulema stated that the spacecraft captured evidence on aliens’ existence andUFOs’ photos, the United States could not have access to. Underwater bases_________________________________________________ From the surface, one enters a craft that looks like a silvery metallic spinningtop, approximately 8ft in diameter, that can comfortably accommodate fourpassengers, and corkscrews its way downwards centrifugally around a rod using aform of magnetic propulsion for what seems to be a only a few seconds down to anunknown depth.I do not think the Chinese yet had this technology. The “Spinning Mobile Satellite” From the second underwater level on down, the “Spinning Mobile Satellite” (SMS)travels horizontally and reaches its final destination at an undisclosed levelof the base at which it again dives into water. It is at that level/destinationthat you will find the habitat and work center of the Grays. Only the highest level personnel with top clearance can go there. Not evenPresident Barack Obama or Vice-president Joe Biden, or any member ofCongress/Senate are allowed access to that level at these facilities.This clearance status was decided upon (jointly) by the NSA, the CIA, the UnitedStates Air Force, the DOD and NASA. Even the FBI has been excluded from thisexclusive little club.In my opinion, this is perfectly appropriate, since politicians come and go,whilst the military are sworn to secrecy, the average career of top militarybrass are thirty or more years, and they take their secrets with them to thegrave.At the present time, so as not to shatter the fabric of our society and causecomplete chaos and total anarchy, this information should be withheld and onlygradually released to the public as set forth in the U.S.-extraterrestrialprotocol, because humans have to be mentally prepared, in order to meet theextraterrestrials.” *** *** *** The Vortex Tunnel_________________________________________________ The Grays’ Vortex Tunnel _________________ I. IntroductionII. Mode of operation and purposeIII. The American military has successfully sent six men through the vortexIV. What are the military implications and applications of this technology? *** *** *** I. Introduction:Created by a group of daring avant-garde scientists, who obtained a governmentcontract to develop such a horrible weapon. It is sometimes jokingly referred toas “the straw”.This vortex tunnel can be turned on and turned off at will, and is a projectthat was started in the 1960’s and became fully operational in the 1970’s. II. Mode of operation and purpose:When activated (usually done in open fields in the American mid-west, away fromfarming and populated areas), an invisible vortex opening that is about ten feetwide, sucks in everything in its path, up to 500feet in all directions.This is only one of its functions.Its primary purpose is to do just the opposite – but to propel object and peopleinto an opening created by its operation that leads into another dimension veryclose to the one we live in. III. The American military has successfully sent six men through the vortex:Has anything/ anyone propelled into that other dimension been brought back toours?The Vortex Tunnel_________________________________________________ The answer is yes. The American military has successfully sent some of itsmilitary personnel who volunteered for the experiment and were sent through avortex tunnel to this other dimension and brought back.Within close circles it is also referred to as the “TTT” or the “Tag TeamTunnel”This team of six were sent through the vortex and were supposed to have returnedwithin a matter of ten to fifteen seconds, but ended up gone for fifteenminutes.When they asked the Gray personnel working with them on this project why the menhad not immediately returned , the Gray scientist laughed at them. At whichpoint they demanded he goes through the tunnel himself to retrieve the men.Within a few seconds, all six men and the Gray were back.In the debriefing that followed, the six volunteers said that the dimension theywere in was so close to ours, as to be able to see and hear one Major put a gunto the head of the Gray, saying “You better go in there right now buddy and getmy men back!” The Gray laughed at him but returned with the six.Apparently all Gray aliens are known to play tricks and games like these withthe military, within many of these joint projects.What did the men see, hear and feel in this other dimension so close to ours?According to the men, they saw a labyrinth of corridors before them, and theonly colors they saw everything in were blue, light blue and light gray. Noother colors seemed to exist in this other dimension. There was no sound orbreeze or any kind of feeling in this dimension, and it felt like a void filledwith corridors. The only sounds they could hear were those of the militaryofficers and camera men behind them who were observing and filming thisexperiment.Turning around to return to the room, the six volunteers said they encounteredthe most unusual invisible, intangible wall that would not let them come throughto the physical world and dimension we live in. Try as they might, and as closeas they were to the others, within inches of them in fact – and yelling andscreaming to be let back in, none of the observing officers heard or saw them.The Vortex Tunnel_________________________________________________ When the Gray went in to retrieve the six from that dimension, he had a deviceon his wrist that he had withheld from the military would be necessary for themen to return.Upon stepping in, he grabbed a hold of the first man, and placed his other handup to the invisible intangible wall of this dimension. The device on his wristrevealed a knob on the wall, which he turned and then told the men they couldmove forward. As the first man went through, to the second man standing rightbehind, it was as if he dematerialized to the width of a page in a book wasflipped over.The wall of this dimension now became foggy, and the other men were terrified ofgoing through it, not knowing whether they too would be turned into sheets ofpaper that could be turned over as if flipping from one page to the next in abook. The Gray assured the men it was perfectly safe, and was their only back toour world, so the men had no choice but to go through. IV. What are the military implications and applications of this technology?Imagine being able to transport an enemy unit of troops, or even one of theirmilitary bases, to this dimension. Within the void of this dimension, therewould be no food, no water, no stimuli of any kind that the human body and mindis used to.Whoever is sent here would go insane from sensory deprivation, whilst starvingto death from hunger and thirst.This technology is still in development, and the Philadelphia experiment was aprecursor to this kind of vortex tunnel technology. *** *** ***  Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Part Six:Aliens/Grays-US Dulce Base War and Altercations > • Introduction…189> • II-The Dulce laboratory incident, and MJ-12 stand…189> • a- 66 American soldiers were killed…189> • b- The extraterrestrials are not benevolent at all…190> • c- MJ-12 members wanted to confess the whole scheme and go public…190> • d- Dr. Edward Teller, inside the tests tunnels…191> • My comment…191> • III- The Anbar Anati’s incident and account…192> • Anati in her own words …192> • Anati: I met the military, NSA, and CIA people at the Four Seasons hotel in> Georgetown, Washington, DC. …193> • The Grays cannot turn their heads independently of their body …193> • Holographic pictures showing the entire sequence of the Roswell crash …194> • Radio plasma belt around earth to isolate earth from the universe…195> • I multiplied myse lf into thirty copies of myself…196> • The Grays are an immediate threat …196> • My visit to the Dulce underground base …197> • Dulce Base lies under Archuleta Mesa on the Jicarilla Apache Indian> Reservation, near the town of Dulce …197> • Heavy spaceship activities…198> • The elevators were controlled magnetically, using alien technology …199> • Hospital-like environment used fo r impregnation of female humans…199Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ > • Genetic labs that created half human/ half animals …200> • Aliens live on levels five, six, and se ven…200> • Aliens experimented with man ipulation of the nervous system…201> • Storage of fully grown creatures and tissues …201> • Level ten was devoted to human aura research…201> • The Grays have reached almost total control over humanity…202> • Everywhere I went I saw Grays in shape-shifted form…202> • Powerful politicians and businessmen wanted to make billions and keep it> secret within a tiny group of the financial elite…203> • Blowing up the base…204> • The government allowed the Grays to go on with the atrocities and the> abductions of human beings…205> • The Grays suffer from Progeria…206> • The later threat will come from the Anunnaki…206> • Gravity will become twelve hundred times greater…207> • The Anunnaki will bring on huge tsunamis…207> • The United States want to have complete military control over the earth…207> • The Anunnaki are not particularly interested in the Americans…208> • Humans are pure evil.

Introduction:These altercations refer to:> • a-The famous “Dulce War” between extraterrestrials and US military;> • b-Several altercation incidents between the United States military/civilian> workers at underground secret bases and the aliens Grays;> • c-Military mass execution at the Dulce laboratory;> • d-Ambar Anati’s blowing up a US Military base. I am quite sure that many of the ufologists’ reports on the altercations arewithout substance, simply because they are “outsiders”, and their writings werebased upon accounts from people who have claimed that they worked at the DulceBase. My confidential sources tell me that 98% of their reports and claims –forthese particular incidents- are false. II-The Dulce laboratory incident, and MJ-12 stand:a- 66 American soldiers were killed.The following presentation is NOT mine. It is reproduced from various claims.Presentation: According to so-called insiders, “ there was a series ofaltercation between the United States military and the aliens at the Dulcelaboratory.A special armed forces unit was called in to try and free a number of militarypersonnel and scientists trapped in the facility who had become aware of whatwas really going on.According to one source, 66 of the soldiers were killed in the effort, and thescientists were not freed.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Apparently, an agreement has been reached between the United States and alienswho co-shared a secret military base, giving the aliens absolute freedom inconducting their own business in the base. The American soldiers and scientistswere restricted from interfering in any activity and the genetic operationsconducted by the alien Greys.In addition, it was allegedly agreed upon by both parties, that the Americansoldiers shall not bear arms in the areas under the direct control of thealiens.”- End of claim. My comment: The clash did happen, but not as described by outsiders andufologists. b- The extraterrestrials are not benevolent at all.For some reasons, sources said, armed military men entered two Grays areaswithin the base, carrying sophisticated weapons and laser-beam guns. A suddenclash occured between them and the Grays. Many were killed. None of the Grayswas injured.Always according to some ufologists and circulated reports in the ufology’smilieu, insiders sources stated that the committee of MJ-12 realized that theywere duped by the Grays, and the United States government made a huge mistake,when it signed a treaty with the Grays, referred to as EBE, an acronym forExtraterrestrial Biological Entities. c- MJ-12 members wanted to confess the whole scheme and go public.Insiders who have worked in various capacities, such as security guards, storagepersonnel, assistant scientists, etc., for a short period of time claimed thatthree members from the MJ-12 committee who have visited the base on numerousoccasions, and learned what it was going on in the base and in the Grayssections, were appalled, and now want to tell the whole story of the horrors,abductions, and freethinking genetic experiments. A few members of the committeeargued that the general public will go berserk, a mass hysteria will destroy thefabric of our society, etc., etc., Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Instead, it would be better and safer to develop sophisticated weapons systemsthat could be effectively used against the Grays.Consequently, the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) was created, and it hadnothing to do with a missiles defense system against the Russian nuclearmissiles. d- Dr. Edward Teller, inside the tests tunnels.Dr. Edward Teller, \"father\" of the H-bomb, was seen in the nuclear test tunnelsof the Nevada Test Site. One insider has claimed that “Teller was driving hisworkers and associates like a man possessed…and well he should be for Dr. Telleris a member of MJ-12 along with Dr. Kissinger, Admiral Bobby Inman, Lew Allen -to name a few members of MJ-12.”My comment: True! Notes:One report said:a-“Security guards who worked at secret underground military bases and for MJ-12were regularly transferred to other units, their names and serial numbersaltered, so to hide all evidences and to prevent any possible leak.b-Nowadays, many believe, including a great number of ufologists, that MJ-12 isa myth, a story fabricated by W. Moore and associates, and publicized by StantonFriedman et al.” My comment: I agree. Although the MJ-12 committee existed for a while, documentspertaining to its mode of operation, and signature of the President of theUnited States on Above Top Secret memoranda, related to its purposes andoperations are FAKE!95% of what you hear and read about UFOs and aliens is false. And out of theremaining 5%, only 3% was documented. In conclusion, 98% of ufologists are stillin the dark, and will never learn about the truth, the whole truth before 2021.This is an absolute fact! I guarantee it! Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ III- The Anbar Anati’s incident and account:It was reported by Ambar Anati, a hybrid-alien, of an Anunnaki origin, that shespent many years in the United States, and attended NYU. The incident/clash story was described in a book “Anunnaki Ultimatum”, Ico-authored with Dr. I. Abel. It is a biography of Anati in her own words.To many, Anati’s account on how she met with the CIA and NSA agents inWashington, DC, her flight to a US Air Force base, her visit to Dulceunderground base, her meetings with the Grays, and how she burned down the baseis a pure fantasy.To others, a possibility.And to a few, the real McCoy. You will be the judge. Excerpts from Anati’account, taken directly from my book. *** *** *** Anati in her own words : I went to a hotel in New York. I had with me a special device, an ingeniousthing that had on it the special telephone numbers of top members of theNational Security Agency, or NSA as everyone refers to them.Only two or three people in the world have these numbers, not even the presidentof the United States has access to them.They are used only for matters related to extra terrestrial reverse engineering.The device makes sure the phones will be promptly answered, and when I called, Igave them data that the y recognized as their own extraterrestrial material.They were shocked, but nevertheless they agree to meet with me. I suppose theyrealized they had no choice. Rather politely, they offered to fly me toWashington DC, where they wanted to have the meeting, but I informed them thatit was not necessary. *** *** ***Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Anati: I met the military , NSA, and CIA people at the Four Seasons hotel inGeorgetown, Washington, DC. It was easy for me to simply materialize in DC, and I did not want them to knowmy current address, if this could be prevented. They directed me to come to theFour Seasons hotel in Georgetown, where they were to meet me at the lobby.I was to know, if questioned at the hotel, that I was heading for the suite thatwas reserved under the name of a Middle Eastern gentleman who owned a limousineservice in DC, and had often used the hotel for similar purposes.I materialized a little distance away from the hotel, and walked there on MStreet. Three members of the NSA were waiting for me, and they took me to thereserved suite, where fifteen more people were sitting around a huge table. Theyrose and greeted me politely, but I could clearly see the suspicion in theireyes and in their thoughts.I noticed that the shades of all the windows were closed, and I saw notelephones. However, they all had gadgets in their hands which I have recognizedimmediately.They were navigation devices, which at the time were known only toextraterrestrials, not to any humans. The Grays cannot turn their heads independently of their body. For a moment I assumed that they got it from the Grays, for communicationpurposes, and then noticed that quite a few of these people were really Grayswho had shape-shifted to resemble humans.I can easily identify them, because even while shape-shifting, the Grays cannotturn their heads independently of their body.They have to turn the entire body if they wish to look to the sides. As theyturn, their eyes cannot follow their heads quickly, like humans’ eyes, but theyhave to refocus.All that is done rather discretely, but after living with the Hybrids and theGrays, I could not miss that.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ In addition, humans usually fidget, move around. The Grays never do. Whenseated, they sit quietly, immobile. When standing, they are straight andimmobile as well. In addition to that, I had more instructions from Nibiru as tohow to recognize all shape-shifters, which I cannot explain because it involvesusing the Conduit.One of the Grays at the end of the table was tapping nervously on the edge ofthe table with something that looked like a pen, and from time to time pointedit towards me. I recognized this gadget as a scanning device, such as we use onNibiru.It was not held by any of the humans, because this fiber/scanning device was notknown to the humans’ scientific community until much later, 2006 or 2007. Isupposed the Grays kept it to themselves for a while.I did my best to ignore the fact that half the people there were Grays, andproceeded as if I had no idea and was talking only to humans.I had nothing to fear, really, since I could annihilate the Grays with onethought, and I decided that discretion was the best approach.The Grays maintained their pretence throughout it, and I said nothing at all.Come to think of it, I was used to the treachery of the Grays, but I have toadmit I was a little distressed by the humans’ duplicity and stupidity. Did theyreally think I won’t recognize the Grays? Holographic pictures showing the entire sequence of the Roswell crash. I have explained to them who I was, telling the absolute truth, and giving myname as Ambar Anati. Naturally they did not believe me. To help persuade them, Ifirst of all, projected certain images on one of the walls.These were holographic pictures that showed them the entire sequence of theRoswell crash, where the Gray was held, and data pertaining to their research.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ They still were not persuaded that I was who I claimed to be, but the fact thatthe projections were done without any equipment made them uneasy and less sureof themselves. They were at least ready to listen. I told them quite a lot aboutthe Grays and their agenda. “By now,” I said, “you must be aware that they donot tell the truth, that they are not to be trusted.”“Business is business,” said one of them. “They have given us more than theypromised, too, so we have gained additional knowledge. It’s not really a bigdeal if they abduct a few more people.”“First of all, it is not a few people. It’s thousands that are tortured andkilled.”“What can we say?” answered another. “Sometimes harsh measures cannot beavoided.” I did my best to hide my feelings about such a statement, and went on.“Are you aware of the fact that they are trying to take over earth?”“No, we were not informed about such intent,” said another. R adio plasma belt around earth to isolate earth from the universe. “And are you aware of the invisible radio plasma belt around earth? They want toisolate earth from the universe. This belt can expand up or down, and can affectmissiles, rockets, or airplanes, and blow them up. It explains what has happenedto various airplanes in Vietnam, and also to human spacecrafts and spacemissions.”“We don’t understand what you want us to do,” said one of them.“I want you to trust the Anunnaki. They intend to help you get rid of the Grays.This is really very simple. Either you go with the Anunnaki, in which case muchcan be done, or you stay with the Grays. If you choose to stay with the Grays,the Anunnaki will return and clean up the earth, in a way that you will notlike. They are perfectly capable of annihilating the entire population if theatrocities do not stop.”Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ “Are you threatening us?” asked one of them. The rest stared at me, impassive.“I would not call it a threat,” I said. “I would call it a fair warning.Remember, the Anunnaki are stronger than both humans and Grays.They did not have to send me, they could do what they wanted without warning.But they prefer to save as many humans as possible.” I multiplied myself into thirty copies of myself. “How do we know how strong the Anunnaki really are?” said one of them. “Afterall, they have been away for so long. They don’t seem to have much of aninterest in us.”“Let me show you a small example of what the Anunnaki can do,” I said.In a blink, I multiplied myself into thirty copies of Victoria; we arrangedourselves around the table, behind the sitting people. They jumped off theirseats, shocked.“It’s a trick,” cried some of them. “Grab her!”“Please, do grab,” I said. “Touch all thirty of me, and see that this is not anidle trick. We can become billions, if we wish.” Hesitantly, they touched someof the multiples. A few multiples offered to shake hands, which the humans did,trembling. They could not deny the multiple’s tangible presence .I contracted myself into one person again, and sat down. “Please,” I said.“I have no desire to frighten you. Sit down and let’s be reasonable.” The Grays are an immediate threat . “Truth is, Ms. Anati,” said one of them, “The Grays are an immediate threat.They are right here and we cannot control them. The Anunnaki are far away. Butstill, we can see that you wish to help us, and it should be considered. Whatwould you want us to do?”Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ My visi t to the Dulce underground base. “I want to start by going into some of the more important places where humansand Grays interact,” I said. “I need much data to deliver to the High Council ofNibiru and receive instructions before I meet the President of the UnitedStates, among others.”“I think the best thing to do is to go to Dulce, in New Mexico. It is the mostimportant joint laboratory of the Grays and the U.S. Government,” said one ofthem.The others nodded in agreement. “There are bases in Nevada, Arizona, andColorado, among others, but Dulce is the most important.”“Very well. Would you assign one of the members to come with me, act as myescort?” I asked.“Yes, Colonel X— will go with you.” The colonel rose. He seemed to be arespectable, middle-aged man. In reality, he was certainly a Gray. As before, Ipretended not to notice.“Would you like me to materialize you there?” I asked.“No, I think it’s best if we go in a more traditional way,” said the colonel.“We don’t want to startle the People in Dulce too much. It’s best if they don’tpanic.” I agreed and we decided to go the next day, in a military plane. Dulce Base lies under Archuleta Mesa on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation,near the town of Dulce. On the plane, the colonel, who had become reasonably friendly, gave me someinformation about Dulce.“It’s all underground, you know” he said. “People know about seven layers, butin truth, there are nine I am aware of, perhaps more I don’t even know about.It’s really a very large compound.”“Where exactly is it?” I asked.“It lies under Archuleta Mesa on the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, nearthe town of Dulce. Very easy to keep it a secret, the way it is constructed,” hesaid. “And they are very careful about security. You will see.”Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ We finally landed at the small air field. A not medium sized building, guardedand surrounded with a high wire fence, stood in the desert.We entered a normal room. I noticed the cameras in the entrance, and a woman inmilitary uniform looked at some papers Colonel Jones presented to her, but thesecurity was not impressive.I realized later that the deeper you went into the compound, the stricter wasthe security. She pressed a button, and a man came to escort us through a doorthat led to an escalator.From then on, it seemed we were descending into Hell.Everything was clean, shiny, and metallic, much like I remembered from myunpleasant stay with the Hybrids. No matter where you looked, you saw a securitycamera. There were side doors everywhere.Apparently, many secret exits and entrances existed, and each was loaded withsecurity features, some seen, some invisible.On the first level we were joined by a Gray. He was polite and distant, andshowed us into various offices without much comment. Heavy spaceship activities. The offices were normal, military, and stark. Maps hung on walls, with manypushpins in various colors stuck into them. The individual colors, the Grayexplained, showed sites of high activity of different subjects.Green, for example, showed sites of heavy spaceship activities, including thoseof extraterrestrials that were not Grays, and were considered enemies by them.Red were for areas of cattle mutilation and collection of animal blood. Blueindicated underground activities and caverns. I do not remember all the othercolors and sites, but the arrangement was quite elaborate.The offices were monitored constantly by humans, who wore military-likejumpsuits. Each carried a gun, quite visibly.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ All the uniforms were decorated with the symbol of the Triangle, much like thePhoenician symbol.They had various letters in each triangle, supposedly signifying rank, but Inever found out if this was true. When they saw that we were accompanied by theGray, they simply ignored us.The second level was exactly the same, full of offices, but after the firstlevel, which we reached by the escalator, we used only elevators. The elevators were controlled magnetically, using alien technology . I was told that the elevators had no cables in them, and were controlledmagnetically, using alien technology. Magnetism also supplied light, which camefrom flat, round objects, and there were no regular light bulbs in sight. Hospital-like environment used for impregnation of female humans. The third level was devoted to hospital-like environment used for impregnationof female humans.I was not allowed into the surgical ward itself, but the Gray explained that theexperimenters removed the fetus, and placed it for speeded-up growth in anincubator, creating Hybrids. In this facility, more than in the one I visited during my previous time withthe hybrids, they tended to experiment with genetic manipulation during the veryearly time in the incubator. The results were quite monstrous sometimes. Through windows in the walls, I saw cribs, or really a sort of cages, with someof the results. Deformed humans were the norm – extra arms and legs, small orvery large heads, and creatures that did not really look humans. “What do you dowith these?” I asked.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ “We harvest certain tissues and then kill them,” said the Gray. “We learn quitea lot from them about genetics. We apply them to our own research.” Genetic labs that created half human/ half animals. On level four, there were genetic labs that created half human/ half animals.Their shapes, as I saw them sitting in their cages, were so horrific, that I hadto avert my eyes.Some of them had a reptilian look, some had fur, and others looked likegargoyles. “Do you harvest tissues here too?” I asked.“Yes, we combine this research with the materials we get from the cows. Theresearch is extremely interesting and useful,” said the Gray. Aliens live on levels five, six, and seven. The aliens had their living quarters on levels five, six, and seven. Theselooked much like military barracks, as we passed the corridors and peeked intothe rooms, but I saw no reason to enter. I asked the Gray if it was true that there were additional levels. This did notseem to phase him at all, and he said, in his perfect English that seemed sounpleasant, coupled with his scratchy alien voice, that yes, of course.Apparently, they took advantage of the huge natural caverns under Dulce, andcreated additional levels.They carried even more security there, and the Gray said that if we wanted to gothere, he would have to call two more Grays to accompany us, and we would needto use an eye identification system.These details were quickly accomplished, and we used a side elevator to theeighth level. *** *** *** Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Aliens experimented with manipulation of the nervous system. Here they also experimented with manipulation of the nervous system by variousmeans. It allowed them to cause disease and even death from a distance.“I am afraid you cannot enter the place where the subjects are kept,” said theGray. “These subjects are mostly insane, dangerous, and very susceptible tochanges in the routine. If we enter, we might destroy some of the experiments.” Storage of fully grown creatures and tissues. Level nine, where we were invited to enter, contained storage of fully growncreatures and tissues in vats, all dead. This included tanks full of embryos invarious stages of development, weighting for use.The place was kept as clean as the rest of the compound, but the smell of thechemicals was overwhelming. I simply could not stay there long, and ColonelJones, who until that time showed no emotion, suddenly shape-shifted andappeared in his real, Gray form.“You knew all along, Ms. Anati,” he said, his voice turning scratchy. “I neverthought we could trick you, and would have preferred to appear in my true formin the first place, but my group insisted.”“It does not signify,” I said. “Of course I knew.” The other Gray did not paymuch attention to the shifting, being used to such practices. Level ten was devoted to human aura research . Level ten, the most secret of them all, was devoted to human aura research, andother extra sensory abilities, including dreams, hypnosis, etc. The researcherswere able to record dreams on specialized machines; the dreams were studied aspart of the major advanced study of psychic power and phenomena.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ “Once we are more advanced in this research,” said the Gray, “we will have totalpower over other races. Of course, we mean no harm to humans nor to theAnunnaki. We are merely concerned with the Reptilian races.” I almost laughed.No harm to humans? Was the Gray trying to be a PR person? The Grays have reached almost total control over humanity. When we finished our tour, we were escorted out of the complex. The plane waitedfor us outside. I said nothing about my disgust, horror, and disbelief toanyone.But I have seen enough, and I knew that this was just the tip of the iceberg.Such treaties must have been entered into by more than the United Statesgovernment. The Grays have reached almost total control over humanity. After materializing myself back to New York, I knew I will always be watched,but I also knew how to handle it and avoid my watchers. I needed time. Everywhere I went I saw Grays in shape-shifted form. First, I spent a few days just digesting what I saw. I made myself invisible,and left the hotel for hours of exploration.I walked the streets, took the subway, went on buses, visited museums, stores,offices, hospitals, senior citizens home, schools, and more.Everywhere I went I saw Grays in shape-shifted form. Obviously, they did notonly infiltrate the military, but spread out much more.They flooded the city. Some worked in offices, some in restaurants, obviouslydoing it as part of their agenda.They were nurses, teachers, officials, sanitation engineers. They were probablydoing the same in other cities, urban areas, towns, and even other countries.For me, as I mentioned before, it is easy to recognize a shape-shifter.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ I was taught how to do it by the best teachers on Nibiru. But a human cannot doso very easily. Your doctor could be one. The nice lady in the department storecould be one.The teacher of your young child could be one. In addition, I saw many hybrids.Vicious, unfeeling, and manipulative, they flocked mostly into the entertainmentindustry, the financial world, and the advertising field. It seemed they likedglamour. The Grays and their slaves, the Hybrids, have invaded the world. After a few days I got to work. Using the same device that had gotten me thetelephone numbers of the NSA members, I spent my time contacting and negotiatingwith hundreds of people from a number of governments on earth.I also visited other laboratories, bases, and Air Force fields. Each time Inegotiated, I have encountered the same road blocks.Every government on earth was in terror of the Grays. The Anunnaki were feared,too, and the knowledge that they will very likely attempt to clean the earth,terrified the humans, but not enough to get them out of their fearful paralysisregarding the Grays. Powerful politicians and businessmen wanted to make billions and keep it secretwithin a tiny group of the financial elite. But that was not the worst. Unbelievably, many individuals in power simply didnot care. All they wanted was to keep their power, to control, to wage war. Theywanted to make billions and keep it within a tiny group of the financial elite,while the rest of the world was permitted to go to the devil. This was a long mission. For years I went from country to country, getting intouch with the people in power, acquiring knowledge, collecting data andtransferring it, every night, to Nibiru.The High Council took it all very calmly, and when I despaired, reminded me thatmy services were invaluable despite the seemingly unachievable goal ofconverting humanity.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ The only bright points of my day were my evening conversations with my daughterand my husband, who were always supportive and loving. I drudged on and on,until I thought that nothing more could be achieved.I stayed until late 2007, and then I made the call and requested permission togo back to Nibiru and make my final report. As always, Marduchk was there for meand I left an earth I no longer loved. I was going home. Blowing up the base. One last time, I said to myself. This is their only chance. If they agree toaccept the final option of changing their ways, good.If not, I would not stand in the way of the Council’s plan of cleansing theearth. It would hurt me a great deal to think of the millions that were about todie. But there will be no more opposition on my part. I would obey the Council,no matter how badly I will feel. With the weariness of an act that was performedhundreds of times over the past seventeen years, I contacted the highest levelmilitary personnel in an important air base which I will call North X, since ofcourse, I cannot reveal the real name. As always, they had no choice but to meetme.At this time, anyway, after all these years of negotiations with everyone,including some presidents of the United States and Europe, I was pretty wellknown – and highly disliked. Perhaps I was even a little feared. The individualI spoke to was very agreeable, and proceeded to arrange the details for themeeting with me. “By the way,” I said, after all was decided upon.“If a single shape-shifting Gray will be at the meeting, I will leaveimmediately. And believe me, I always recognize a shape-shifter. You see, thisis the last meeting I plan to have with any human, and the presence of a Graywill defeat the purpose of it.”“There will be no Grays at the meeting, Ms. Anati,” said my contact. “I canpromise you that. My colleagues and I have already discussed the issue beforeyou and I came to arrange the meeting. They feel the same way as you do.” Well,that was a good sign, I thought. We shall see.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ Arriving at the air base, I was immediately taken to a small, ordinaryconference room. A few people rose from their seats at the conference table as Icame in.There were two generals in military uniform, one retired admiral, who worked forthe NSA as a consultant and was a co-proprietor of a major civilian jetpropulsion company, a colonel who worked as test pilot for Douglas and Boeingcompanies, and a person that I guessed represented the White House.As always, they were extremely polite, and indeed, none of them was a Gray.Perhaps by that time they finally believed that I could recognize ashape-shifter, or perhaps they had their own agenda.I think, in light of what took place later, that the second option was thecorrect one. They wanted to hide the meeting from the Grays. The government allowed the Grays to go on with the atrocities and the abductionsof human beings. We sat around the table, and they turned to me, ready to hear my offer. Theythought that I still was ready to negotiate. Of course, the time fornegotiations was over, but they did not realize that.“Allow me to summarize the current situation for you, gentlemen, I said.“Whether you take action now or later, you will be facing an extraterrestrialthreat. The threat you have now comes from the Grays who are controlling yourscience and space program, and dominating a major part of the earth.The Grays know that you have tried, for many years, to find a weapon system tocounter attack them. And they know very well that you have started this programwhen President Reagan took office.They also know that you failed to develop such a weapon system on your own. Thatmeans that you are defenseless. You know it, and they are aware of it.This is why you allow the Grays to go on with the atrocities and the abductionsof human beings. It makes you feel safer with them.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ However, what you don’t understand is that the Grays will not be satisfied byonly kidnapping people and going on with their abominable experiments. The Grays suffer from Progeria All their experiments were aimed toward saving their own doomed race, which isdying slowly from an epidemic of Progeria which they cannot control. By andlarge, they failed. So now they want permanent visible bases on the surface ofthe earth, and much more scope for further experiments on a larger scale.”“They have never mentioned this plan to us,” said the White Houserepresentative.“Of course not. This is top secret. They know you will feel like cornered ratsand fight back.”“So what will happen when they take over?” asked the Admiral.“They will kill many humans. The rest will be put in concentration camps, to beavailable for use whenever needed. In other words, you will be taken over, andthis, to all intents and purposes, will be the end of the human race.” The later threat will come from the Anunnaki. “I see,” answered the Admiral, in a low voice. He was clearly thoughtful.“What is the later threat you have mentioned?” asked one of the generals.“It will come from the Anunnaki. You don’t feel it now, not quite yet, but it isjust as real. However, it is very different from the threat of the Grays.The Anunnaki are not interested in establishing any bases on the surface of theearth or in the oceans, nor do they wish to experiment on you.They want, quite simply, the complete destruction of your military systems,submarines, carriers, and satellites.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ They will throw an electro-plasmic shield over the earth, which will preventairplanes from taking off. Gravity will become twelve hundred times greater. This will apply to every airplane, no matter how big or small, military,commercial, or private.Gravity will become twelve hundred times greater than the way it is now,preventing everything on earth from moving, including human beings. Then, a kindof artificial lava will finish off the biosystem of the earth. The Anunnaki will bring on huge tsunamis. You will not be able to fight it, for the simple reason that you don’t know whatit is made off. In addition, the Anunnaki will bring on huge tsunamis.However, the worst part will be the issue of magnetism. Positive and negativemagnetism will be distorted, and this will alter the laws of physics on earth.This scenario may sound like science fiction, but you know better than that. Itwill start around the end of 2021.You will suddenly be confronted by confusion, when all clocks and watches willstop, and ships in the sea will collide with each other without knowing thereason, among other results of the changed polar magnetism.”“We would consider severing all relations with the Grays,” said therepresentative of the White House. “That is, on one condition.”“I don’t think the Anunnaki will be willing to negotiate conditions,” I said,“but do tell me anyway. Perhaps something can be done.” The United States want to have complete military control over the earth. “If the Anunnaki will send an official military delegation from Nibiru rightaway, bringing with them scientists to developDulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ a system like the plasmic belt and the Star Wars program, and guarantee to usthat the United States can have complete military control over the earth, wewill be willing to cooperate with them.Also, we want a system that will allow us to cause major ecological catastrophesto North Korea, Iran, China, Afghanistan, and parts of Russia. Naturally, itshould look like a natural catastrophe, not anything man-made,” said the WhiteHouse representative.“The Anunnaki will not give you such programs,” I said resolutely. “It is not atall within their plans.”“So you are refusing to protect us! If you don’t protect us, why should we breakour agreement with the Grays?After all, how do we know you are really coming back, or even if you are tellingthe truth about the Grays’ plans?And quite frankly, why such a sudden interest in human affairs on the part ofthe Anunnaki, and in Americans in particular? The Anunnaki are not particularly interested in the Americans. “Nonsense,” I said. “They are not particularly interested in the Americans, youare not more important than anyone else on earth.The only reason for contacting you in particular is the fact that the Grays havetheir bases in America. All the star gates, the genetic laboratory facilitiesand installations are either underground in America or in the American militarybases. In short, the Grays are contaminating the human DNA from right here.”I could see that they believed me. But they were still naïve enough to believethat the Grays will eventually help them develop the Star Weapon system theyhave promised but failed to deliver.The American still wanted to buy some time, and they were not really sure how todo that. I could feel their confusion.“Ms. Anati,” said the Admiral. “We would like a little time to confer beforegiving you our final answer. If you don’t mind, allow me to escort you to one ofour private guest lounges.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ They are quite comfortable, I’ll arrange for coffee and some refreshments, andwe will come back for you in an hour to finalize our plan. Would that be allright?” Humans are pure evil. They are treacherous creatures. It would have been just fine, had this been the real plan. Very natural andappropriate. But my Conduit was open all along, and I read their thoughtsfreely.I knew what they meant to do to me, and it did not include coffee orrefreshments, nor did it take place in a guest lounge. But I decided to playtheir game, and went quietly with the Admiral, who chatted pleasantly whileescorting me to an elevator. The ride on the elevator was long. Very long. We went down, obviously into someunderground facility. I said nothing about it and pretended all was well.Eventually, the elevator stopped, the door opened, and at the door, three orfour soldiers waited for me. I was grabbed unceremoniously, while the Admiralwent back into the elevator, not even giving me a glance.I was shoved into a cell, they locked the door behind me, and I was left alonein their underground prison.As I said, I knew this was coming, but having my resources, I had no reason tofear these people. I could, of course, dematerialize myself and get out any timeI wanted.So I sat on the narrow bed, directed my Conduit, and listened to theirconversation. I must admit that I experienced a slight feeling ofclaustrophobia. I have come so close to being an extraterrestrial that it was inevitable. But Irepressed it, reminded myself that I could leave any time I wanted, and listenedcarefully to the conversation in the conference room.“It won’t take long, they are all terribly claustrophobic,” said the Admiral.“Her energy will drain away, like a battery, very soon.”Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ “Will she die?” asked the White House representative anxiously. “I am not surethis is a good strategy, we may be held accountable for any issues that mayarise from her arrest.”“She won’t die so quickly. She will go insane first,” said the Admiral.“Well, so what do we do now?” asked the retired pilot.“We have all sort of options, but what is clear to me is that we must confusethe Anunnaki and get them off our trail,” said one of the generals.“But she may contact the Anunnaki first,” said the other general.“This will be a good thing,” said the Admiral. “At the same time she contactsthem, we will send signals that will confuse them. They won’t be able to decidewhere to go to get her. In the meantime, she will go mad.”“Are you sure they drain away like the Grays?” asked the first general.“Oh, yes, they are all the same, these filthy aliens,” said the Admiral. “Lether rot here, and we will have the Anunnaki and the Grays so confused, they willfight each other, and that will take care of all our problems.”At this moment, something happened in my own mind. I realized that I no longerwanted to save these people. They were pure evil, and the Anunnaki do nottolerate evil.I felt, to my own amazement, that I no longer cared about how many contaminatedhumans would die in the cleansing. I knew the Anunnaki will save the clean ones.Let the others go. I grinned. Yes, I finally started thinking like a fullAnunnaki. What’s more, I felt that I was quite capable of killing them myself.I remembered how shocked I was when my dear, kind, loving husband killed withoutbatting an eyelash. I was even more shocked when my beloved sister-in-law toldme that she had killed too, on various missions she had undertaken. Now Iunderstood.I was not angry with these treacherous creatures. A cold, determined feelingwent through my mind instead. It was all so simple. They were evil, and so theyhad to die.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ I created a plasmic shield around me. Calmly, I created a plasmic shield around me. Nothing in the known universecould penetrate it. Wearing it, I could pass through an exploding star andsurvive.Then, I made some calculations, figuring out how much energy was needed to blowup the entire base, killing everyone inside it in an instant. The plasmic shieldwas invisible and I could hear perfectly well through it until I chose to switchthe audio off.I materialized myself back into the conference room. The look on their faceswhen they saw me was so priceless, I had to laugh.“Well, gentlemen,” I said quite politely, “this is the end. I could haveexploded the air base from anywhere on the face of the earth, but I wanted togive you the news personally.”They must have communicated quickly with some of the personnel, because aboutfifteen soldiers, well-armed with all sorts of paraphernalia, burst into theroom and rushed to grab me. The plasmic shield made them fly backwards, and somehit the wall. One or two fainted from the blow. It’s time to blow the air base, and say goodbye. “I would not bother, if I were you, gentlemen,” I said. “Believe me, there isabsolutely nothing you can do. Well, it’s time to blow the air base, and saygood bye.”“Please, Ms. Anati, we will do what the Anunnaki ask us!” cried the White Houserepresentative. “Yes, yes, tell the Anunnaki we have no conditions! We will obeythem implicitly!” said the Admiral. The others just stood there, terrorized.A few years ago, perhaps I would have taken pity on them. I would have thoughtof their wives, children, pets…by now I knew this was stupid sentimentality thatmade me less than an Anunnaki.That was over now.“Too late, gentlemen,” I said. “Good bye.” I turned down the audio, andactivated the explosion.Dulce Base, Grays, altercations with aliens, Anati an Anunnaki_________________________________________________ It looked like a nuclear bomb. It sounded like one, even through the plasmicshield. And it worked like one, too.Nothing was left of building; I was now standing alone in a huge, black, gapinghole in the ground.From other buildings, people came out, screaming, running wildly.I ignored them, nodded with satisfaction at the cleanliness of the job, turnedaway, and proceeded to materialize myself in another continent.I did not want the CIA agents hunting and bothering me like flies and gnats. Ofcourse, I could kill them. But what is the point of doing the Anunnaki cleansingjob for them all by myself? Well, it was time to leave earth. If I ever came back to it, after it wascleansed, I would no longer be the same woman. I have changed, and my place nowwas on Nibiru.However, I could not just call on Marduchk and ask him to pick me up as usual.Ahead of me was another task, the most important task of all. This task will bedangerous, tremendously risky, but unavoidable, and I will have to do it alone. Somehow or other, I will have to leave everything of me that was human righthere on earth.Only then will I be able to place my mind into the clean, perfect Anunnaki bodythat was prepared for me some years ago.I will have to do that with no traces of humanity, or of any possiblecontamination.For that, I would have to shed my old body like the skin of a snake, leave it onearth, and go home not in a space ship, but rather, send my mind through amultidimensional ba’ab, which meant, in human terms, that I simply had to die.” Note:Ambar Anati’s account was given to me during my visit to New York City.

Time: 1:52 PM. Eastern Daylight Time.E-mail address: warrior007@speakeasy.net As is, word for word, and unedited: “Dear Mr. de Lafayette, Here is part of my story... Five and a half years ago, my mind waselectronically attacked by way of microwaves, elf waves, andelectroencephalography.I became a target of harassment, gaslighting, gangstalking, etc. It was morelaughable than scary. No one knew what they were doing, fortunately for me.The attack involved transmitting their voices into my head by way of microwavehearing or voice-to-skull technology, which enables one to bypass the ears andtalk directly into the auditory neuro-receptors of the brain.I was also being given the shared dream experience, somewhat like in the movie,\"Inception.\"Well this attack opened a dimensional doorway into my brain and I started tocommunicate with people that weren't human.Suddenly my shared dream experiences were more of extraterrestrial andunderground kingdom origin. They made me part of their collective. They told methat I was indigo and that they needed to do things with me.Now regarding the less benevolent ET aspect to this, the Gray involvement.It turns out that the Grays, Draconian, and Reptilians are running thisoperation by way of their disembodied and embodied white supremacists, mafia,and gangster minions. Their are also CIA and NSA aspects to this as well.Part Seven: Stories and reports_________________________________________________ I don't know if abduction was part of my experience or not, since it couldeasily be \"memory-wiped\", but the Grays tell me that I am not a part of thatbecause as they say and I quote, \"We don't do anything to people like you,because you know what you are.\"That translates to myself being a higher awareness.They use lower awareness beings for manipulation and behavior modification amongother things.They have used my libidinal energy though.Now my experience has been vast. I've seen Grays walking through my home, mostlyin apparition form.While some of these beings can give you chills, other times the experience hasbeen quite amusing, since I hear their voices all of the time. They have been inthe United States since at least the 1930's or 40's and they are well adapted toAmerican culture, so to hear them swear like sailors or make a reference tosomething in pop culture, like a tv show or movie is quite funny. It's none ofthis, \"Take me to your leader.\" or anything else that are given stereotypes.They sound like everyday people.My brain has connected to all sorts of types of extraterrestrials,extradimensionals, people of the underground kingdoms, and unfortunately somehumans for five years and the experience has been exceptional. Now I also havemuch contact with hybrids. The hybrids have more human qualities and they don'treally care for the full on Grays. Some of them live in the underground kingdom,where they escaped to or just left.Some live at Area 51.Those ones at Area 51 said that if I had a way to be there, my attackers \"wouldget their asses kicked.\"There are so many different things going on that I wonder if you would have anyspecific question that you would like me to answer. I have beings connected tome 24 hours a day. Maybe I could get a hybrid to answer any questions as well.My truth is stranger that most people's fictions. In the meantime, all the bestto you!-Sam Bryar *** *** ***Part Seven: Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Q&A:I had a brief interview with Mr. Bryar. Here are my questions and his answers: Question: What did you mean by “I was also being given the shared dreamexperience”?Sam: When I was first electronically attacked I was experiencing bothvisitations and manipulations in my dreams. I was put in certain types of scenesand situations.Initially these dreams were simulated nightmares and human harassment.Later they became visitations from women and then ultimately extraterrestrialand extradimensional experiences. I haven't had a single dream or privatethought to myself since May 2005.Humans have the technology electronically to manipulate and share in dreamexperiences. However many different beings exist on astral and extradimensionallevels and when this door into my mind was opened these beings began to pursueme in large numbers. Question: Could you please explain this to me “I started to communicate withpeople that weren't human”?Sam: As this electronic harassment experience got started, the only peopletalking into my brain were humans. But soon later people were speaking to me inEnglish, but their terminology was entirely different.Certain communications were not conventionally making much sense. I knew that Ihad been no longer speaking to anyone human. They used terminology such as\"house\" for the word \"body\", which is the housing unit of the soul, rather thanidentify the body with who you are. Question: What did you mean by “Suddenly my shared dream experiences were moreof extraterrestrial and underground kingdom origin”? What underground kingdomare you referring to?Sam: I was initially experiencing dream manipulation from human factionselectronically.Part Seven: Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Not long after that I started dreaming with communication in very fastdisjointed English who would repetitively show me something a streaking fireballor meteor going across a vivid blue sky and then they would try to talk to meabout it. Other times I would find myself somewhere like Telos, Shamballa, orAgharta with someone attempting to tell me something. Question: You wrote, “They told me that I was indigo and that they needed to dothings with me.” What things? And who are they?Sam: They are a collective of beings from both underground, other planets, andother dimensions. They are of a benevolent nature. They told me that I was anadvanced spiritual incarnate soul and that such evolution could make my ownpersonal merkaba beneficial to many beings as we approach the end of an upcomingcycle of transformation for this third dimensional earth. Some of them come tolearn how to raise their vibrational frequency for such a transformation.Other more advanced ones want to show me the right way to things so that I maybe of such assistance. Question: Can you elaborate on your statement, “It turns out that the Grays,Draconian, and Reptilians are running this operation by way of their disembodiedand embodied white supremacists, mafia, and gangster minions.Their are also CIA and NSA aspects to this as well.”How do you know this?Sam: Personal experience and lots of literature. They will even verify suchthings to me through my mind link.They don't care. You may reference such things with Val Valerian's MatrixSeries, Volumes 1 through 4, my electronic harassment website, www.emhdf.com,including a book by Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler atwww.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf[http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf] , Commander X's books -\"The Controllers\", \"Mindstalkers\", and \"The Cosmic PatriotFiles\" Part Seven: Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Question: Explain what do you mean by, “the Grays tell me that I am not a partof that because as they say and I quote, \"We don't do anything to people likeyou, because you know what you are.\"Where did you encounter the Grays? What did they mean by “you know what youare”?Sam: I encounter them every day. Mostly all contact with Grays are auditory inmy experience, with visual contact from time to time.The Grays came with the white supremacist, mafia, gangster, and CIA aggressors,so when I became linked, they became linked. Now I have to hear Grays just aboutevery day. As far as what, \"You know what you are.\" means.Everyone non-human that I have encountered uses this terminology. They think onlevels of awareness.\"You don’t know what you are.\" means that you are an infant, a child, or anunderdeveloped adult. There is a universal law that states that\"awareness-of-an-awareness units\"' free will must be respected and allowed toevolve. However, Reptilians and Grays found a loop-hole in that clause where they canpersuade an \"awareness-of-an-awareness unit\" to consent to giving up theirsoul-mind-body complex for harvesting. The Grays want lower awareness for mindcontrol, body manipulation, behavior modification, etc. Question: You wrote, “They have used my libidinal energy though.” How did theyuse your libidinal energy? Can you give me an example or two?Sam: I really don't have an example for you. I don't know the process involved.The Grays are sensation deprived and if you have strong libidinal energy like Ido they will feed off of it.The human loses all sexual interest, stimulation and sensations. The grays willoften flock to places of pornographic film making and prostitution, I havelearned. Question: You wrote, “While some of these beings can give you chills, othertimes the experience has been quite amusing, since I hear their voices all ofthe time.”Part Seven: Stories and reports_________________________________________________ What do you hear exactly? Do you receive messages from them? What did they tellyou?Sam: Since I hear them everyday I hear a vast array of things. Maybe at somepoint you may ask me something and I will them. Question: You wrote, “Now I also have much contact with hybrids.” What kind ofcontact?Physical? Mental? Telepathic?And what did you get out of this contact?Sam: Mental, telepathic, and from the shared dream state. I get that they wantmore contact with humanity. That they want to embrace their human side more thantheir gray side. They want some sort of love-based union with the human race. *** *** ***"},{"pageContent":" Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Recent E-mails: People talking about their experience and encountersStories and Reports I received via E-mails.______________ As is, word for word, and unedited.From Chris Smiley [http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000844707737] ,Rescue Diver/USCG Lic. Captain.Captain Smiley authorized us in writing to publish the following on October 12,2010, at 7:53 pm. *** *** *** George and I’s Close Encounter .I have see n some kind of hovering craft about 200 yards long hovering, w nowind or sound with a lull in the rain, we went out to watch the creek washingout the road we had just built and saw it when the lightning struck behind itseveral times. An amber smaller rover looking craft or car or something crossed and circled thefield and appeared to be traveling very smoothly across this mud pit of about400-500 acre wheat field freshly plowed! It had to have been summer because thiswould have been the only time we worked down there.There was phosphorous on the fence where we had seen the smaller object on theground and had crossed the fence. Then we laid our .22 rifles down at the fenceleaning them up against a cedar post by the two rungs of wire that were glowingwith a green phosphorous glow very slightly in two pretty small spots andstarted in the direction of the object.Well, we didn't get very far maybe two or three steps and we looked at eachother without saying a word and backed out!We weren't scared at all, but we weren't gonna get stuck out there in that mudeither and especially without our rifles! We didn't want to get ourselves shotand we didn't know what this thing was so we couldn't shoot at it and wewouldn't have unle ss it jumped something or us.Stories and reports_________________________________________________ The smaller object was separate from the very large hovering craft a few minutesbefore we approached the fence in fact it was what we saw first. We couldn'timagine the neighbor’s truck could be out in that field. This was back in thesummer of 1978-'80 or so, with a friend I grew up with and still keep in touchwith during and at the dead calm of an 11-inch in one-hour rainstorm frontpassing through one night in Hamilton, TX. The lightning was thick and fromcloud to cloud with long spidery rips and once in a while from ground to groundoff o the East where it was heading off to, but the rain part had just passed usmaybe five clicks to the East and the rain had stopped and there was, like, nowind, but the clouds above looked like they were churning and low like 500-1000feet low and oppressive and dark, thick and black looking.When we jumped the fence and began walking across the deep black double chiseledand double tandomed plowed field we sank to our knees in a few steps and bothdecided to move back and approach from the perimeter along the Southern creekside even though the water was raging and we decided this might be a real quickexit strategy too if this got any weirder.The rover thing was about 450 yards away on the far side and just blinked outand then lightning stuck again behind the object. We saw it was huge and aboutmid field and sloped to the tree line like it was masking its silhouette parkedtangent to the edge of the creek that headed due East and the hovering silentobject with no wind or sound ran 300 yard sloping downward to the North andlooked black and utterly non-reflectiv e like flat \"Black-hawk Black\" but itdidn't really look like a helicopter at all. It looked like a disc with a heightof about 50 ft. at the center and tapered about the same on both ends. It looked like it absorbed the light in contrast to the tree silhouette in thelightning compared to the bright flashed exposed behind it and there was notransparent views between the outside edges inside of the silhouette of hehovering object! It then had what looked like a line of low glowing red and Bluelights running along the leading 300 yard edge and was tilted slightly to blendwith the terain in behind it as we aproached.Stories and reports_________________________________________________ The two edged led looking line of lights looked like separate arms or somethinggoing down and up hinged at the outer edges and split down the middle. He and Igot within say 45-50 yards and were staying down in the gully in an ox-bow ofthe upper creek bed above the rushing water with a hump between us and the soundof the water, but no wind above the edge or any more rain. The air was so thickyou could cut it and the clouds seemed like the mu ffled all the sound aroundus, the lightning spiders were still going on but the ground lightning wasfading to the East pretty fat and getting further and further between intervalsand the sound of the thunder was fading it was probably 15-20 miles off by now,the rain.We could hear nothing and feel nothing coming from the direction of the largeobject and as we peered over the edge into the field we saw its edges flex intwo separate sections outlined by the low glow of the lights at the edges andthe next time the lightning flashed within seconds it was gone, the both ofthem. We waited for a little bit, but we didn't want to get caught again if itstarted raining again so we took off for our rifles at the fence and the houseabout 1/4 mile from the vantage point. When we got back it was about 3 hourslater than we both remembered it should have been, but we were just kids.We didn't tell anyone about it when we got back to the house maybe a 1/5 a mileaway and didn't talk to anyone else in the house about it to this day, butbriefly some years later me and my friend brushed about it very briefly. Wejoked that maybe they picked us up and that was what was wrong with us \"Dar HeHe\" but all in all it was just some kind of joke.We never spoke about it again. Well, I'm a hell of a tracker and so we went backto the cabin and went to bed. The clouds were black dark and ominous, but itdidn't rain any more that night. The next day we went looking for a trail andanything on the ground would have left a major one.All we found was our tracks in the grass, on the barbwire and where we set ourrifles down and in and backing out. It hadn't rained at all after we left andfrom the look of those clouds it sure should have even after raining 11 inchesin the one hour! That was it.Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Zip! Nada! No trail, tracks or anything and my eyes weren't lying! So I easilyexplained the glowing phosphorous by the fact that we messed up our own trailand one of us may have crossed the fence first and might have stepped on a earthworm or some kind of bug. The rest I assumed came from Fort Hood. I know of nopilot save the USCG helicopter guys or the Rangers that would even attempt thatand I always wondered if they controlled that weather.It was very odd. I am sure I could find that night on the weather reports! Itshouldn't be to hard to find a drop I calculated some where in the neighborhoodof around of 150 million gallons of water/ sq. mi. in an hour! It took us acouple of days to find the 8' X 25' covert pipe which swished down two miles ofwate r gaps and fence.

My abduction (Orange sphere) I am now 33 and the time of this event happened when I was 20 but have beenafraid to talk about it due to the idea that maybe I was crazy or that no onewould believe me I have only told my wife in more recent years. This happened inthe fall of 1996I was 20 years old and a friend of mine and I had hitched hiked out to anotherfriend of ours house who live outside Ferndale Montana as I didn't have a car atthe time. It was fifteen miles from from Kalispell Montana.It was an overcast evening in the early fall and by the time we got out to myfriends house it was starting to get quite dark outside and as we walked up thedirt road in the woods we noticed that the dogs were not barking which wasactually pretty odd as we could always here them bark as we approached thedriveway. we kept walking up the road and Rob says to me \"its too quite\"thinking nothing of it kind of chuckled to myself saying \"yeah\" and lit acigarette.We walked up on the porch and just as I began to knock on the door I actuallyfelt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up before that time I only thoughtthis was a form of expression but its not this actually happened I stopped justbefore my hand made contact with the door.Stories and reports_________________________________________________ And I looked over at Rob and Rob looked at me and I could see the expression onhis face and knew instantly he felt the same way I was feeling. At the same timewe slowly turned around and there before us not anymore then 2 feet above thepine trees was a huge orange sphere glowing like molten metal as big as a houseand completely silent!I remember being so scared my nose began to tingle and I felt tears welling upin my eyes after that I must have zoned out for a long time I don't know exactlyhow long we hand been standing there 20 minutes?An hour? Two hours?I don't really know but I came out of what seemed to me like a trance like stateand I no longer was smoking the cigarette I had lit was what seemed to be a fewminutes before that, I had the lighter from my pocket and was holding it outtowards this Orange Sphere flicking it I didn't even know I was doing it! Myfriend Rob must have come to his senses just then too because at that samemoment he grabbed my arm and says in a harsh whisper too me \"KNOCK IT OFF!!\"I looked at Rob and could see the fear in his eyes he looked like he was goingto cry and I felt the same I told him \"we can’t just stand here\" and that weneeded to find cover! Realizing our friend whom we came to see was not home andthere was no place to go.In the driveway was my friend old Subaru brat with no windows, we bolted for thecar and each jumped in a door, Rob on the drivers side and me on the passengersside we sat there for a while and watched this thing which seemed to us to havea feeling of malevolence about it.It sat there motionless for a long time and then through the overcast clouds weheard a small airplane thinking surly when it gets close enough it is gonna seethis thing! As the plane got closer the Sphere seemed to shrink in size down tothe size of a flashlight I though to myself how is that possible? As the planepassed out of site it seemed to just zip right back to its original size and Ireally studied it this time it was a solid object for sure! I though to my selfI could throw a rock and hit it and the noise that it would make would probablysound like a loud DONGG!Stories and reports_________________________________________________ Like if I were to take a rock and throw it at a battleship was what I picturedin my head. It was solid! I could see it. I knew it wasn't a trick of the eye itwas there!! We watched it not knowing what to do or where to go for probablyanother 10 minutes right after this a huge beam of light came off it and hit theground and started a sweeping motion back and forth as if it were looking forsomething at that point I was so scared I could barley move the feeling couldonly be described as horrifying as I realized something must be down here on theground not far from us I said \"Rob we gotta get inside that house!\"He looked at me and says to me \"on the count of 3. 1.2.3 and we jumped outleaving the car doors open and bolted for the door with all my might I kickedthe front door in and we bolted inside I took one of the kitchen chairs andpropped it against the door handle.I called the police in Kalispell first thing and told them my name and how old Iwas that I had not been drinking or doing drugs and that I wanted to report aU.F.O and would someone please come out here and see this thing, the policeofficer just laughed and said I can give you a 1-800 number to call and reportU.F.Os if you would like?I hung up the phone in frustration I was feeling pretty helpless and looking outthe window could see that thing still out there like it was looking forsomething I'm guessing it must have been about 3 in the morning and wasexhausted Rob and I both fell asleep on the kitchen floor.When I woke up the sun was out and the was no sign of that thing out side butlooking out the window and seeing the car doors still open gave me a veryunsettling feeling about the events that happened just hours before.I finally was able to track down my friend using his house phone and explainingto him what happened that night even now I don't think he trusts me about whathappened as if maybe we were up to no good and trying to steal from him orsomething of that nature.About a month after that I became obsessed with U.F.Os being a non-believerpreviously I was now fully obsessed. Stories and reports_________________________________________________ My sleep patterns had changed I couldn't sleep at night almost out of fear andwould stay up reading about U.F.O reports and abduction stories trying to weedout what was most likely a real one from someone just made up bullshit.Then it happened one night I was laying in bed and had fallen a sleep when Irecall waking up with these shadowy figures around my bed home alone and wasterrified thinking this has got to be a dream but I knew it wasn't I was fullyawake and I couldn't move I couldn't scream and then I don't recall whathappened because I must have blacked out I woke up in my bed and it was morning.I told Rob about this and he looked at me once again with a terrified look andsaid \"shut up I don't want to ever talk about this again!\"I’ve tried to get him to talk to me but he just wont at least not about thatnight or if he had the same experience with the so called \"shadow people\" Iguess I will never know. I do know what happened to me was real.” *** *** *** Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ From Experts, Authors, and Researchers P[Image00011.gif] hoto: Author, Eugenia Macer-Story.

E-mail address: Eugenia Macer-Sto rye.macer-story@att.net [e.macer-story@att.net] Reference: Talismanic Materialism\"article & author's photo attached. Date: October 15, 2010.Note: Eugenia Macer-Story is a world-class writer, a poet-playwright, and amember of the U.S. Dramatists Guild, whose paintings in interdimensionaliststyle have been exhibited internationally.She has written numerous books on the supernatural, most recently \"Pulse Of TheDragon: The Secret Knowledge Of The Pirates\". Her website is: e-macer-story.com Talismanic Materialism This work deals with talismanic practice as a reality. We are familiar withseveral different forms of materialism, among them: measurement by materialgauge, dialectical materialism, and financial materialism—whether this besocialist or free enterprise.It is well-known in traditional yoga systems that the material cosmos isinterpenetrated by an integrative structural energy both in the organic andnon-organic realms. The term “jyoti” is used to signify this energyinterpenetration as a god/ goddess of light responsible for the functionalinteraction and co-ordination of events in the palpably perceived materialcosmos.There is an obvious cognate here between the word “jyoti” and “joy”. The yogause of this “divine” energy is often translated as “bliss”.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ But is sheer delight the only manifestation or use of this energy? In yogateaching, hatha yoga is comprised of jyoti (light) and mantra (sound).The living manifestation is an actual intermeshing of the “upper sphere ofvibration” (light, the head of the snake) and the lower sphere of vibration(sound, the tail of the snake) from supersonic sound down to the lower plane.“Light” in these yoga teachings is also visualized as extending “from the cosmicether rays through the ultra colors to infrared.”In modern texts on yoga, the method of awakening the “kundalini” or serpentpower is given in outline with the clear provision that an initiation by aninstructor is necessary for understanding the texts. It is true that yourpresent correspondent did not really understand such books as “The Yoga OfLight” by Hans Ulrich Rieker (1971) a translation from a German translation ofthe “Hatha Yoga Pradipika” when she originally read these texts intellectually.It was only after initiation by a martial arts practitioner and years ofexperience in practical use of talismanic energy that she became able tounderstand these texts, which are written symbolically.It is important to understand that, like spell-binding and talismanic magick,the “yoga of light” can be used destructively. In fact, the force of “Siva”, thelord of destruction and change, is seen as the guide of the “raja yoga”practitioner in passive use of “bindu”, sense or intelligence, to integrate theactive and palpable forces of “hatha yoga”. In other words, Siva is theimplement of intelligent change of the individual and/or cosmic or universaldestiny.Intelligent change is different from the more restrictive concept of“intelligent design”.For the concept of design as in architecture or visual art implies control ofthe entire pattern, as in the composition of a musical score. However,intelligent change involves some alteration of circumstances and/or thoughtpatterns which deliberately shifts the flow or accustomed expectation ofmaterial events—but also affects events within the many dimensions attached tothe material. Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ So, in the case of “talismanic materialism” the transformative action of “Siva”may involve a very small item. It can be assumed that the proper construction ofa talisman—involving the full energetic attention of the individual—will serveto shift events by changing via the palpable material object also the attached“etheric” patterning. This energetic shift by no means controls the way theseetheric triggers will play out in the sense of perceived destiny.After contemplation of the practice (and anecdotes about the practice) of anumber of shamans who have been observed to ‘cause’ events, the example ofRolling Thunder, a Native American medicine man from the Southwest U.S. standsout as a whimsical illustration. This person could make the weather shift bytickling the belly of a beetle with a straw. In this situation, it is wise torealize that the attention of the shaman—male or female—may like the lightningstorm fork off in a multitude of directions, causing electrical power outages orfires as well as bringing needed rain. Into the Direction of “Atlantean” Claims A PR agent, based in New York City, has been in his apartment for forty years.It used to be an early twentieth century speakeasy. He has experienced many pkevents there involving electric light slowly dimming in and out, a quartz-tippedwand spinning as a friend reached to touch it and a large steel kitchen cabinetfalling suddenly as all metal bolts released at the same time. These pk eventsseem to connect with circus posters of a magician “Kar-Mi” aka Joseph Hallworthwhich he has on his wall. I connect this with my Uncle Art’s adventures as ayoung man running liquor during prohibition and perhaps even being in the sameapartment when it was a speakeasy…Art Goff knew Blackstone, the magician.Perhaps “Kar-Mi” and other magicians of his era had also visited the samelocation as entertainers so that when the PR agent put up ‘Kar-Mi”’s. posters hemight have activated a remnance-like spirit of the actual magician. Thus theposters might be said to be “talismanic”. Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ There were odd electrical malfunctions in my house in Woodstock while I wasconsidering a business association with this PR agent—which ceased when Idecided not to hire him for business reasons, and realized that perhaps hisplacing an article about Von Kivitsky’s metal fragment in a tabloid had been amistake. For the very ancient dating described in “ Hexing and Healing: TheWhole Shebang ” 1 [text00003.html#sdfootnote1sym] was real and tabloid coveragemight have tended to discredit the situation. Another encounter with this PRagent which was similar will be discussed later in this paper. Beyond theoretical uncertainty: The importance of place.According to the well-known Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in 20 th Centuryphysics, on the nano mass level it is impossible to measure small particleposition and momentum at the same time. So in talismanic materialism one setsposition, as in Feng Shui, and disregards the strictures of linear time. The“earth chakras”, or “portals” are constant geo-space coupled with the “darkenergy” situation manifesting as a “dark flow” indicating actual unknown“structures” streaming in a way unaccounted for by current models of massdistribution in the universe. And indicating a “multiverse” beyond our familiaruniverse. RustHeavy rust found on an iron piping joint discovered in the cellar office spacenear Tompkins Square Park, as mentioned in my book “Pulse Of The Dragon: TheSecret Knowledge Of The Pirates” is of interest in two areas: time research andresearch into anomalous oxidation in areas of” high strangeness” and anomalousactivity.The iron pipe joining, intact as found in 2007, was used as a candle holder forprotective meditations in the area. When moving from the office several yearslater, it was noticed that the pipe joining had accumulated an unusual amount ofrust, which flaked off at the touch. For this reason, the iron piping was put inPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ the garbage at the space and the meditation candle was destroyed. The areaitself is not positively aspected and the destruction of the literal, materialconnection allows the item to be discussed without exactly invoking the “rust”to follow. However, the image remains in the historical matrix as an example.[Image00012.jpg]Figure One Two questions arise: a) Why was the old iron joining not heavily rusted whenfound? B) Why was the rusting apparently accelerated from the time it wasinitially used as a convenient candle holder? Was this due to a combination offlame/ hot wax and iron without modern alloy or had the joining been placed inthe area only shortly before “Magick Mirror Communications” took the space? Theroom was in disarray at the time of entry, so it’s hard to say for sure.There were odd plumbing problems in the cellar which might have been poltergeistphenomena. Did the iron joining, which seemed antique, actually appear in thecellar office (to become the candle holder!) for some unknown reason?When dealing with “causes” in matching puzzle pieces embedded in the future,items will occur in the future/present which seem to pull the future/past “intoplace”. Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ It is wise therefore to exercise caution in recording the present. When the E.Macer-Story paper “ Quasi Quantum Material Shift:Unexpected Synchronous Effect To Battery Cells ” 2[text00003.html#sdfootnote2sym] was presented in 2004 as part of a WSEAS (WorldScience) conference in Athens, Greece there seemed to be a palpable force ofinertia or resistance in the situation. Yet the paper itself was approved byunknown referees and published by WSEAS. Details of the resistance at the conference have subsequently emerged assignificant although at the time these incidents were minimized in favor of theactual presentation and publication of the paper itself. In 2004, a large group of presenters, mainly Chinese, got up and left the roomjust as I was preparing to present the initial talk about concepts ofparamagnetic/ kinetic nano reaction rather than photon based energy transfer inthe case of time anomaly and material apports (materializations anddematerializations of apparently solid objects). At the time, the chair personof the session and E.Macer-Story did bring this to the attention of themanagement of the conference. But the consensus was that the impolite Chineseexodus from the room was due to a linguistic cultural misunderstanding tootrivial to detail here.E. Macer-Story, did chair a large group right after the incident, and presentthe abstract of the paper for this group, while at the same time feelingstrangely reluctant to present the entire documentation with projectedtransparencies, some of which included reference to Tibetan meditationpractices.I now understand that there were scientists from other countries at theconference who may have been working on similar concepts and/or might have had astrong reaction to the traditional belief systems concerning “mental powers” and“spirits” cited in the presentation.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ Perhaps, as in the case of the anomalous metal fragment encountered in the early1990’s, as mentioned in “ Healing and Hexing: The Whole Shebang ” , there wasactually research into similar concepts going on under the guise of paperspresenting “toy models” of space vehicles and automatic, robotic vacuumcleaners. Indeed, there was a flash of anomalous visual light during thepresentation of an Iranian scientist on concepts of the “Josephson Junction, atechnical concept involving nano-magnetic effects on superconductors utilizinginducted oscillation of high frequencies, as formulated in 1973 by physicistBrian David Josephson. Anomalous effects to electrical devices, which may be dueto a similar causality, are mentioned in E. Macer-Story’s controversial paper “Quasi Quantum Material Shift: Unexpected Synchronous Effect To Battery Cells ”In traditions of sorcery worldwide, there is a belief in “spirits” with avariety of names, some of which reside in diagrams resembling the diagrams ofelectrical circuitry. [Image00013.jpg]Figure TwoPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ Sorcery Sigil 3 [text00003.html#sdfootnote3sym] . In Richard Cavendish’s book “ The Black Arts” 4 [text00003.html#sdfootnote4sym], he describes a goodly number of rituals for summoning these spirits, alwayscommenting: as is fashionable, that the spirit summoned is “from the innerenergy of the magician” although Cavendish does discuss this energy supposedlyactivated from within the human mechanism as a “real force”. “ The spirit may show itself in a form created for it by the magician’simagination, but it is a real force. It may be a force or intelligence whichexists independently of the magician, and if so it is no more imaginary than theforces of electricity or gravity, or it may come from within the magicianhimself, in which case it is no less real than the forces of ambition or prideor desire which we recognize in ourselves.Behind all this, of course, is the perplexing question of what reality consistsof and whether it is sensible to regard those things which we seem to perceivein ‘normal’ conditions as real, but those which we seem to perceive in‘abnormal’ states of mind as unreal.” This modern interpretation, perhaps introduced to make the book moreintellectually fashionable, may actually be incorrect in emphasis althoughCavendish does mention the possibility of a “force of intelligence” existingindependently of the magician in a way similar to electricity or gravity. In some instances, of course, the magician/ sorcerer may be bringing to lifeinner phantasms but not in all cases. The warning against failing to dismiss theconjured spirit, common to most traditional grimoires, indicates that theconjured spirit entity isPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ independent of the sorcerer’s volition and may act independently for good orill. In fact, in ancient grimoires there is the caution that a spirit whichseems not to appear may be hiding. One presumes these traditional practices arebased on actual conjuration experiences and observation of effect.We now know that the “dark energy/ mass” composing a large portion of the knownuniverse is “hiding” also within traditionally-accepted electromagneticstructures and that in addition to this “dark energy/ mass” on a small scalethere is a “dark flow” of galactic structure which may involve a multiverse. 5[text00003.html#sdfootnote5sym]Traditionally, the beings conjured by sorcerers and shamans do come from “otherworlds”. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, these are the “hell worlds”. Beingsfrom the hell worlds do not, in natural form, look or behave like human beings.But, according to a number of accounts they can impersonate human beings. It isprobable that modern attempts to update or change ancient formulae found inreligious carvings or manuscripts might have bizarre consequences if thetranslator imposes a strictly anthropomorphic form onto the deities beingsummoned.According to Richard Cavendish in “ The Black Arts ” 6[text00003.html#sdfootnote6sym] infamous magician Aleister Crowley changed theoriginal adjective in one of his Egyptian conjurations from “headless” to“bornless”. In his book on the excavation of Tutankhamen’s tomb 7[text00003.html#sdfootnote7sym] Howard Carter describes “ At the Eastern end ofthe shrine were two massive folding doors, closed with ebony bolts shot intocopper staples, their panels decorated with strange figures—headless demonguardians of the caverns of the Underworld.”The idea of a being which is from another realm entirely and was never born isquite different from the idea of a being which has no head. The “Headless One”might actually refer to the octopoid aerial entities summoned by T.J. Constableand Wilhelm Reich and similar orb like forms.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ According to urban legend, during one conjuration by Crowley of a “Bornless”entity a demon impersonating the instigating magician was seen to appear outsidethe protective magic circle and attacked his assistant, Victor Neuberg.I have never had such a thing happen because I have never invited such a shapeshifter into an elaborately pre-crafted “magic circle”. I have experienced thesemi-materialization of an entity calling itself “Prince Ali”in digital photosof a small stone which materialized seemingly “out of nowhere”, falling on thefloor in front of me in my living room. The actual small size of this stone canbe seen beside a small paperclip. [Image00014.jpg] [Image00015.jpg] Figure Three Shortly after drafting the preceding section about “Prince Ali” I came across abook about the “Satanic Rituals” of Anton Szandor LaVey, an original editionpublished in 1972. which had never been read 8 [text00003.html#sdfootnote8sym] .The spine of the book was tightly perfect-a virgin volume! This book was locatedin a used book store in Old Kingston, N.Y. and I do not recall seeing it on theshelf when I browsed the store a few weeks previous.That night I heard the presence of “Old Scratch” within the interior bedroomwalls of my house in upstate New York. Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ After a few loud episodes, “Old Scratch” became silent when addressed as aspirit rather than an invading animal.The following night there was slight scratching in the same wall which ceasedwith a sharp rap as I thought about masquerades of the “devil” in medievalEurope as described in a chapter on witchcraft I had been reading in RichardCavendish’s “ The Black Arts” . It grows very difficult to discern, because ofthe torture and witch hysteria at the time, whether or not these “devil priests”were phantasms of spirits or people in shamanic disguise. In fact, Anton LaVey’sbook on ritual magic stresses the importance of stagecraft and design in theritual situation, with specifics somewhat like the traditional practice of FengShui or Shinto wherein the physical arrangement of circumstances is of maximumimportance in actualizing the mentally formulated goals.One thinks of the alchemical motto “as above-so below” in trying to understandthe effects of “Old Scratch” . The action/ intent “above” might be a mentalalert or intent which manifests as the sound of scratching in the wall.But how does this happen? Obviously, there is a kinetic molecular action in thesubstance of the wall which interacts with the atmosphere and causes a soundreaching the ear. How does this sound begin in the plasterboard if there is noconventional source, such as an animal exploring a hollow wall?In order to consider this question, we must get past the contemporaryindoctrination that —for example— Urban Grandier in the 17 th Century , theinfamous priest sorcerer memorialized by Aldous Huxley in his book “ The DevilsOf Loudoun” , was actually only a perverse person (in the psychoanalyticalsense) inducing sexual hysteria in celibate nuns. Documents, both a contractwith the Devil written and signed by Grandier and a pledge of assistance by theDevil written from right to left and spelled backward, do exist in historicalrecords Unfortunately, this pledge was for only twenty years of assistance afterwhich Grandier would curse God from hell. Ultimately, the priest-sorcerer wastortured and burned alive. I believe we make a mistake in assuming “the devil”was simply part of the wicked imagination of this man.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ Recall the doppelganger of Aliester Crowley supposedly seen by his assistantstanding outside the magic circle. What was that? What is the image of “PrinceAli” visible in the zoomed photo?The staged rituals in the “Satanic Rituals” by LaVey may be a significant cluein understanding technically how to actualize “as above/ so below” in alchemicalstyle. However, when we get to the “Ritual Of The Nine Angles” the processbecomes a bit obscure. LaVey seems to be dealing with a personified version ofwhat Rupert Sheldrake called “the morphogenetic field”., a shadowy invisiblepersonality from the realm of spirits which is said to change from generation togeneration. “ Every age has its own manager, who directs affairs according to mydecrees. This office is changeable from generation to generation, that the rulerof this world and his chiefs may discharge the duties of their respectiveoffices, every one in his own turn.” 9 [text00003.html#sdfootnote9sym] and togive instruction not by the book but by “unseen means”. “ I lead to the straightpath without a revealed book. I direct aright my beloved and my chosen ones byunseen means. All my teachings are easily applicable to all times and allconditions.” 10 [text00003.html#sdfootnote10sym] William Seabrook, famous forhis writing on Haitian voodoo, also investigated the mountainous area said to bethe original location of the Yesidi tribe, referred to by LaVey as the origin ofthe original worship of the god Shaitan. 11 [text00003.html#sdfootnote11sym]Although we can take the diabolism of socialites and carnival musicians with agrain of salt, there is indication that the natural effects of “invisibleintelligence” do not actualize by electrical process, which is sequential (asine wave) but by kinetic means analogous to the action of an applied, movingmagnetic field. The ritual action taking place in 4d spacetime is accompanied bymental action limited to certain pre-determined techniques and objectives.Add to this the possibility that “intelligence” on the nano level may interactwith this kinetic drama to produce molecular effectsPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ which then register with macro-cognition as sounds, images or even the simulacraof material objects. The basic concept is that the “will” or intent is notacting directly with the macro mass shapes but with the micro, nano- fabric ofintelligent templates which “push” the larger molecular arrangement, as in amagnet moving metal fragments from beneath a neutral surface or a sound from atuning fork creating specific patterns of sand on a level surface.Thus a device which has been prepared or “actualized” magnetically and/oracoustically might provide a better templating situation as in the ritual use ofconducive lighting/ sound arrangements combined with active combustion as in theburning of a candle flame or incense.Fire is used in a number of traditional rituals during which images, writtenrequests or questions are burned. Perhaps this is not simply a symbolic gesturebut , combined with the right mental state, does cause a literal catalysis onthe fundamental level. Yet , in the case of the unusual rust on an iron pipefitting as mentioned earlier there does not seem to have been any particularmental effort directed toward the process of oxidation and formation of rustunless the simple action of using the “found” iron fitting for a meditationcandle holder was enough in that cellar location to accelerate the rust/oxidation process. It should be stressed once again that the older pipe fittingwas smooth and in adequate condition when originally noticed in the partlyrenovated basement. Rituals to Open the Mind’s Eye In an exploratory spirit meditation done prior to leaving the challengingsubterranean office space, a non-human intelligence manifested to the mind’s eyein the form of an octopus or jellyfish-like image with trailing tentacles.Whatever one might think about this image “rationally” in the modern day, thejellyfish or octopus prototype is found on the temples and secular buildings ofMinoan and other ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean area. Some of thesetemples are in natural caves or underground tunnels.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ The possibility occurs that a facilitation chamber might be built underground inthe presence of an ionic-magnetic array and salt water. The cellar office inlower Manhattan is known to be adjacent to a salt water aquifer which extendsfrom the older harbor area beneath an older residential area of the city.In this context it is worth noting that Howard Carter, who successfullyexcavated the Tomb of Tutankhamen in Egypt at the beginning of the twentiethcentury, made special note in his book on this project of the presence of waterin the tomb, which is actually an enhanced cave structure. King Tut’s tomb isdistinctive for archeologists because most major art objects, statuary and theelaborate sarcophagus of the King were actually still intact inside the tombwhen it was opened. Most similar tombs of the 18 th and 19 th dynasties ofancient Egypt were stripped of valuables and even of the royal mummies (whichwere buried with jewelry) before archeologists thought to investigate them.An archeological excavation in the UK at “Star Carr” dated to 8, 500 B.C., about6000 years before the date of King Tutankhamen’s tomb- also revealed arelatively well-preserved site near water, an ancient lake near Scarborough N.Yorkshire. In this site were found antler headdresses and red deer skull bonesworn as masks. in ritual ceremonies. Along with these were found a quantity ofwooden artifacts which the archeologists (as according to his notes did HowardCarter in Tutankhamen’s tomb) are now rushing to preserve against decay 12[text00003.html#sdfootnote12sym]In the close, humid atmosphere of the underground chambers the wood artifactsfound in King Tut’s tomb ( remember these are 3, 500 years old) remained pliablefor transport but in the desert air became dry and brittle./ According toCarter, the finely wrought jewelry found in the tomb of the young pharaoh wasthought to have magic powers, and seven ritual oars placed between the innersepulchral shrine and the North wall of the Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ chamber containing the sepulcher were thought to assist the king in his journeythrough the underworld. 13 [text00003.html#sdfootnote13sym]In the entire narration of the excavation of King Tut’s tomb Howard Carter seemsvery aware of the actuality of ancient rituals. He cites a “zealous student ofthe occult” who advised by letter:” In the case of further trouble, pour milk,wine and honey on the threshold. ” Although Carter writes in his book that hedid not have the exact ingredients, on site, he seems open to a spell ofprotection perhaps put in place from afar by an absent expert.Recalling the “Satanic Rituals” of Anton LaVey with trapezoids, “Nine Angles”and various other geometric stipulations, it’s interesting to note thedirectional orientation of King Tut’s tomb (which also might have played a rolein preservation of artifacts within the subterranean chambers). The long axis ofthe rectangular burial chamber (East to West) is at right angles to theantechamber, with the actual sepulcher room to the North of the entrance to theantechamber.As previously mentioned, “ headless demon guardians of the caverns of theunderworld ” are painted onto large double doors at the Eastern end of thesepulchral chamber. Recall the “ bornless/ headless” confounding of these typesof Egyptian images by the 20 th century would-be adept A leister Crowley.Plentiful ceremonial sticks and batons found in King Tit’s tomb of course alsosuggest the legendary magic wand, manifesting both as a simple reed and heavilybe-jeweled baton. Spontaneous Combustion Howard Carter notes the “spontaneous combustion” of certain fabrics near thebody of King Tut’s mummy. As he writes:” The oxidation of the resin [poured intothe mummy case as part of funeral ceremonies] has given rise to a kind of slowspontaneous combustion, resulting in the carbonization of thelinen fabric and, to a lesser degree, of the tissues and even of the bones ofthe mommy.” 14 [text00003.html#sdfootnote14sym]Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ The archeologist finds this effect, which may have been a deliberate safeguardby the priests of Osiris, an irritating obstacle to the removal of the mummyfrom its close-fitting coffin. He also comments on fragments of a papyrus foundupon the body of King Tut along with a number of amulets as perhaps being aspell or charm after the fashion of the written spells described in the originalEgyptian “Book Of The Dead”.Howard Carter states about one amulet found on the mummy:” The older orb growingout of the younger crescent symbolizes the god Thoth who personifies the moon”This is an interesting observation as Thoth is commonly represented as abird-headed deity. Maybe Carter is unaware of an older tradition linking thegoddess Isis and/or an even more ancient female deity to the phases of the moon.A Y-shaped amulet of sheet gold found on the abdomen of King Tut’s mummydescribed by Carter as an object whose “ meaning was not clear” may have been anancient dowsing rod. 15 [text00003.html#sdfootnote15sym]Thus it may be that archeologist Howard Carter, unaware of the actualsignificance of these talismans, may also have overlooked the functional meaningof the situation of this and other Egyptian tombs near subterranean limestonedeposits which channel and retain water. But perhaps: not exactly. Perhaps whenwe study only the geometric and/or symbolic structure of the ancient pyramidsand tombs we are not getting the whole picture. Ancient Egyptian murals andcarvings show pharaohs with evident dowsing equipment. 16[text00003.html#sdfootnote16sym] After all, these people lived full lives beforethey died and were enshrined amid amulets and spells. The actual inspiration forthese talismanic charms is not archaic. Natural Magic and/or the Forces of Darkness?Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ In July of 2010, the automatic snapshot editing function first called myattention to the “face” in the glass window frame left of the open window screenin which the rabbit being photographed was seen in the yard quite clearly at adistance from the screen. The auto-edit for tourist snapshots “recognized” ablurry face before I did! The window to the left in the snapshot is the glassdoor panel which had not been slid back to show the screen. On the first photoof the small rabbit standing still in profile in the yard with a large dark eyewhich attracted my attention I was situated close to the screened window, whichshows wire grid divisions on that photo. For the second snapshot, which showsthe face-like form in the glass door panel. I had been relaxing in a chair withmy morning coffee and then quickly captured the returning rabbit from adistance. So the screen grids were not as close to the camera. When the auto-detect software zeroed in on the face-like form in the window Ibecame aware that there might be much more to the rabbit visitation than asimple nature spirit saying hello. In deciding to deal with this level ofinquiry it is necessary to work with Interdimensional Intelligenceprofessionally , as one might work with an ordinary co-worker on the job or aperson who is being interviewed for an article on a more mundane topic.[Image00016.jpg]Figure FourPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ Advanced Intelligence which opts to appear in the window is evidently the“supervisor” in the situation. In ordinary work situations, the supervisorsignals the employee not the employee the boss unless some worker is designatedto provide an alert to the supervisor. Usually emergency action office channelswill not go through the boss exclusively. Maybe this seems like a description ofthe fashionably dreaded “hive mentality” of advanced intelligence alluded to bymodern UFO researchers; but this is the way it began, as a low key encounterwith a rabbit who came into my yard and attracted my attention.On the other hand, the experience with the small hare and face-like form in thewindow might be part of a different pattern of interdimensional contact whichpre-dates by thousands of years the modern “ufo” sightings. When I web-searchedthe term “ancient Egyptian hare” I came up with references to the goddess “Unut”who is shown in profile in a sketch from an ancient carving looking exactly asthe rabbit in the snapshots appeared to me in my yard. 17[text00003.html#sdfootnote17sym]On Wednesday July 28, 2010 at about 10:30 p.m. I was sitting on the backscreened porch, site of the previous “rabbit” encounter, when I saw at adistance two twinkling orange lights which merged behind the trees.. I rose fromthe porch chair and went over to the window screen. The orange disk now seemed alarge orange moon. I sat down again. Then the “moon” became very small anddisappeared. As I watched, the orange twinkling lights again appeared and thenthe larger orange “moon” reappeared. I stepped out onto the porch steps to takea photo of the large orange disk, using my cell phone camera (the same camera Ihad used in daylight to snap the rabbit).On the digital viewer, the photo is of a bright, white distant orb on all threeshots. Possibly this is actually the full moon sans atmospheric refraction. Butwhy would the refraction effect be different for the camera mechanism than forthe human eye?Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ And why were the near tree branches partly obscuring the large orange disk notvisible in the photo of a distant orb in the night sky? Possibly this is becausethe automatic focus of the tiny camera detected light at a distance and the neartree branches were initially reflecting no light. But the auto flash of thecamera did not illumine the edges of these dark branches-if it functioned at allfor the quick series of photos. Looking at the site the next morning indaylight, it was easy to see trees and power lines in the direct path of anyview taken of the sky.When I later viewed the photos on the computer in digital zoom, the bright whitedistant orb in all three photos was seen to have a bright rim, dull center andinternal bright circular dots. In the initial distant orb photo the shape whichwas initially seen as an elongated orb or two orbs merging is seen under zoom asa rimmed amoeboid shape with an arrangement of bright dots within the dull innerportion. [Image00017.jpg]Figure Five—Amoeboid Orb Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ There is also an arrangement of bright dots as part of the “face” found by thecomputer’s auto-edit function in the shots of the rabbit in daylight previous tothe experience with the merging orange lights. Perhaps the amoeboid orb with abright ring and bright dots on the dull center portion is a version of the rarebut distinctive symbol of the god Thoth “ the lunar disk, the older orb growingout of the younger crescent ” alluded to by archeologist Howard Carter as foundin the excavation of King Tut’s tomb. 18 [text00003.html#sdfootnote18sym]Throughout the experience with the merging orange lights, whether or not thesmall “orbs” showing on the digital photos were actually the moon, there was ashifting perspective problem which was continually happening. In this case, thecamera mechanism (an extraordinarily good device in my Samsung cell phone) wasrecording items which my human eyes did not immediately perceive.The digital frames show two anomalies different from eyesight. Most importantly,the close , circular disk of light which was photographed outside slightlyobstructed by trees shows as a smaller, distant bright “orb” unobstructed bytrees or power lines..Also, the “face”-like form at first indiscernible in the entire digital frameshowing an indoor view looking out from the partially screened porch at thesmall rabbit was automatically selected initially by the HP jpg “editing”function which is designed to find images of people in a blurred background.This face-like form was later observed not to be present on the solid glass asan artifact of dust or accumulated film on the glass surface.So it’s a paradoxical situation Whereas the camera picked up a distant orb notseen closely, the camera also registered a close form seemingly outside theglass door which was not noticed by the photographer focusing on the nearbyrabbit seen through the screen of an opened glass window panel. Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ In understanding what may have triggered the camera mechanism, consideration nowturns to the quadratic formula currently used to calculate distance and relativespeed for mundane purposes. This quadratic shows X (the quantity being figured)as a form of solid geometric notation..F[Image00018.gif] igure SixPart Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ This quadratic has both a positive and a negative root. In basic instruction inuse of the quadratic formula, students are told to disregard the negative rootbecause it does not work in practical 3d calculations. According to onetutorial: “From the standpoint of needing the dimensions of a farmer’s field,the negative solution doesn’t make any sense so we will ignore it.” 19[text00003.html#sdfootnote19sym] This may be good practical advice for asurveyor, but it’s not good science. When considering the negative quadraticroot, it can be observed that the length of the X-dimension sought as “unknown”is different for the negative as versus the positive square root. But thenegative root of a variant length has existence nonetheless. Perhaps the difference between the images in the digital frames underconsideration and the images perceived by the local human eye in this case andthe case of a variety of anomalous “spirit orb” or “ufo” images which appear onboth digital and 35mm film (as well as Polaroid) relate to the negativequadratic root engineers and surveyors are told to discard for convenience.In fact, the negative quadratic root in the very basic sense may relate to themap dowsing and on site field dowsing experience mentioned earlier in this paperin archeological context. This use of the function represented by the negative quadratic root may occurwhen people are able to discern the geo-location of a target by other than3-dimensionally measured means; but evidently by a process attached to the 3-dlocation or object they may be seeking.It is important to stress that the negative quadratic root is not an “imaginarynumber” (The square root of a minus number as known to mathematicians.) but isan item of real number geometry which has been overlooked for engineeringconvenience.The negative quadratic applied on the nano level as mentioned with regard tooxidation and combustion earlier in this paper creates an interesting realgeometric situation.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ It is possible that the actual connection to the living energy used intalismanic practice is detectable in the geometric formation of the bloodplatelets 20 [text00003.html#sdfootnote20sym] and action of the chlorophyllcatalyst 21 [text00003.html#sdfootnote21sym] , within molecular configuration ifapplied using nano quadratics.But where is the real connection in non-organic matter, the manufacturedenergy-charged piece of mass which provides the portal or contact forinterdimensional action?It seems that this must be via the living energy which certain mysticaltraditions call “light”. But one must ask: what sort of living “light”? Theremay be different sources of “living light” depending on whether the geometricshape is moving clockwise or counterclockwise.Thus the “fictive fluid” of mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912): “ Poincaré assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each pointof space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which alsocarries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the centerof mass remains uniform. Poincaré said that one should not be too surprised bythese assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions .” 22[text00003.html#sdfootnote22sym] (speculatively attached to each electromagneticmass point) can be actually rotated in either direction in the plane or ineither direction as within a plane 90 degrees perpendicular to the original 2dplane.As regards, Poincare's \" fictive fluid \" the missing link which transformsspeculation into real results is simply the sixth dimension of the Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ fluidice matrix 23 [text00003.html#sdfootnote23sym] as this acts upon thefictive fluid of the fifth dimension.Conceptually, this sixth dimension can be understood as a \"mind pilot field\"structurally guiding electromagnetic mass manifestation though it's not thatsimple.Prior to experiencing the merging ufo lights discussed earlier in this paper,and after photographing the single rabbit observed in the previously describedincidents of late July 2010 I had spotted (at different times) both twin spottedfauns and twin rabbits in the yard .I shared the experience with an Internetfriend but had not photographed them. On Tuesday July 17, I once again sightedthe twin spotted fauns with their mother which I had seen in late July but thistime in a different location, farther from the house. The sighting of these twinanimals in context of the merging two “ufo lights” in the same time periodactually alerted me to the possible meaning of the behavior of the lights.Returning here to the initial topics of strangely-aspected geo-areas and the“talismanic” quality of the small 3d area of a “sacred” and/or valued object,one can easily see that the variable size or length of the negative square rootmay be related to the observed variables in visual perception, such as the closemerging orange lights which became an orange disk registering within the digitalcell phone camera as a distant ameboid orb, perhaps the moon.There are also within this subtle mental process evaluative as well as strictlygeometric considerations such as the ethical decision to tithe when thetalismanic action links in to a shared destiny perspective. In a secondencounter with the PR agent mentioned in the opening section of “TalismanicMaterialism” who had in the meantime lost touch with the puzzling metal fragmentdescribed in “ Hexing and Healing: The Whole Shebang” . 24[text00003.html#sdfootnote24sym]Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ I agreed to pay him a reduced amount for publicity services, while knowing thathe could not come through with the exact services he promised since he had justcome out of the hospital after extended medical treatment for a difficultillness.I wanted photos of the “Kar-Mi” poster situation in his apartment, which Iobtained after hiring the PR agent. On two of the photos a deceptive “whitewolf” appears. But one must be careful when evaluating the masks or imagespresented by spirit entities, as mentioned earlier in this paper (p.6) withregard to the entry of 5th dimensional energy literally into the 3d massstructure. Actually, the “white wolf”; figure 7] manifested as white light uponand/ welling up through the plastic sculpture of a large gold eyed cat behindthe elbow of the PR agent sitting in an armchair. The wolf spirit was perhapsbeing educationally deceptive, as in the classic “trickster” represented in manytraditions as being a fox, lynx, coyote or dog. One of the ‘Kar-Mi’ posters doesshow the magician shooting a cracker off the head of an assistant from theloaded battle of a gun he has partly swallowed. [Image00019.jpg]Figure Seven Let us now refer back to the section of this paper involving “Satanic Rituals”described by technical concepts and geometrics. The ‘off the 2d page” componentof the “fictive fluid” utilization involves the burning (combustion) of a modelof the six dimensions of mass basic to the “Fluidice Matrix” formulations.Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ These six dimensions are obviously connected to the larger dimensional matrixand by manipulation of the 6d model will enter and trigger the largern-dimensional matrix, irrespective of linear time.The paper model can be constructed of index cards of three sizes. The largercards which form the 4d membranes (‘branes” for short) between instant points oflinear time serve as the floor and ceiling of the mid-sized card representingthe sixth dimension which is folded in accordion zig zag perpendicular to the 4dbranes and containing through a slit the small card representing the fifthdimension, which is also perpendicular to the 4d branes but unattached to them.Supported within the tangential 6d brane sandwich filling, the 5d strip can movethrough the slit in a positive or negative direction or remain at situationalequilibrium.An Observer on the 5d brane would thus (by an act of will or destiny) be able toperceive both the 6d shifting context and the tangential 4d branes which areaffected by shadow pressure from the varying positions of the unattachedperpendicular 5d moving into past or future or maintaining a steady “now”balance. All of this takes place within mass structure. Deliberate Combustion of Destiny Once this model has been constructed, it should be placed in a metal bowl andentirely burnt with ordinary matches.As the model is burning, a simple situational goal should be assumed by themental magician. Ashes from this ritual should be earthed in water and flusheddown a drain. *** *** *** Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ [Image00020.jpg] Figure Eight Part Six: From experts and researchers/Eugenia Macer-Story_________________________________________________ A[Image00021.jpg] ssembly of Fluidice Matrix Talismanic Model Figure Nine __________________________________ Article by Eugenia Macer-Story.
