Theypracticed his gait, his manner of speech and his modus operandi – what he didduring the day and night.\"Using a double is not a novelty, or something unusual. On April 19, 1945, theNew York Times wrote, “He (The double) was supposed to be a total look-alike,and he was trained to be Hitler and was supposedly going to die a martyr’sdeath…”A top-secret military report based upon military interrogations proved beyondthe shadow of a doubt that “Martin Bormann has selected at least one double forAdolf Hitler, and Minister of Propaganda of the Third Reich, Josef Goebbels haspersonally trained six doubles to impersonate Adolf Hitler.”The Double of Field Marshal Montgomery:Monty had numerous certified doubles, to name a few:1-Keith Deamer Banwell.2-Edward Clifton James.3-Miles Mander.Meyrick Edward Clifton James on numerous occasions impersonated Montgomery.

It is marked 'BBC, Churchill:Speech. Artist Norman Shelley' and stamped 'September 7, 1942'. The recordingwill also help to sort out the confusion about the authenticity of many of theChurchill tapes in circulation.Shelley, a well-known radio actor before his death in 1980, first claimed in thelate Seventies that the British Council had confidentially asked him to stand infor Churchill. Biographers and historians have argued ever since about whethersome of the key morale-boosting speeches of the era - including the 'We shallfight them on the beaches' Dunkirk speech of 4 June 1940 and the 'Their finesthour' speech of 18 June in the same year - could have been made by an actor.Both speeches were originally delivered by Churchill in the House of Commonswhich, at that time, was not wired for sound recording. According to Shelley,Churchill was too busy to come into a studio to record his words and so agreedthat, as long as he had final approval of the voice, an actor might take hisplace.Later, the provenance of recordings of these speeches was further muddled by thefact that Churchill agreed to record some of his most memorable lines for theBBC archives after the war was over.Last week the late actor’s son, Anthony Shelley, found the crucial record amonghis father’s possessions in his home near Chepstow, South Wales.He had always believed his father’s story, he told The Observer, but is pleasedto see him vindicated with some hard evidence. ‘I knew my father was not thesort to have been pulling people’s legs about something like this,’ he said.“There is absolutely no way he would have made this up, and a BBC recordingwould not exist unless they had intended to use it.The trouble is that, like a computer virus, once there is a recording out therethat sounds right it will get around.”According to Shelley’s great friend, former BBC radio and TV producer andpresenter, Trevor Hill, Shelley did indeed stand in for Churchill on at leastthree occasions, specifically when Churchill was ill or out of the country.This would never have been divulged at the time. Shelley’s party piece, oftenrequested apparently, was for everyone to close their eyes while he impersonatedChurchill when, according to Hill, it was impossible to tell the difference.From the BBC, Tuesday 11 September: 2007:“Historical documentary series based on the memoirs of Walter Thompson who, aswell as being Churchill’s personal bodyguard for over 20 years, was the PrimeMinister’s close friend, confidant and companion.The Germans become more determined to shoot down Churchill’s aircraft. Walterfoils one assassination attempt but the Prime Minister’s double is not solucky.”*** *** ***The Double of Stalin.Joseph Stalin too had a double known to insiders as Rashid (Rash), real name:Felix Dadaev, who was trained by the Russian actor Alexei Dikkiy at the KGB’sheadquarters in Moscow. The double was used to replace Stalin in state andpublic functions.Rashid died in 1991, at the age of 93.In 2008, Alexei Dikkiy claimed that he was the principal “decoy of Stalin”. Heappeared on German Television and told his story as Stalin’s double.In his autobiography, he stated that Stalin had in fact 4 doubles, and some haveappeared as Stalin in newsreels and official rallies.*** *** ***A close up of a person Description generated with very high confidence[image423.jpg]The double of Boris Yeltsin:According to Aleksandr Salii, a member of the Russian Duma, an unknownindividual impersonated Boris Yeltsin on many occasions, and especially duringand after the period of Yeltsin’s open-heart surgery.The double of President Harry S. Truman:Edwin Wright who served under President Truman in various capacities has gone onthe record with claims that an unknown person impersonated the voice ofPresident Truman on the telephone on more than two occasions while talking toforeign ambassadors and delegates to the United Nations. This claim isdocumented by the archives of the Truman Presidential Library.The double of Henry Kissinger:According to a former aide to Secretary Kissinger, an unknown personimpersonated Henry Kissinger during a secret visit he made to China in 1971.The doubles of Saddam Hussein:According to Jerald Post, the brain behind the CIA's Psychological Profile Unit,Saddam Hussein was quite often replaced with doubles he picked himself.Thus, using a double, multiple doubles or a decoy is not a novelty or somethingunusual. Consequently, the possibility or veracity of Hitler’s doubles is notunconceivable!However, I did not propose this possibility based upon rhetoric and conspiracy’sliterature, for I have gathered tangible proofs, numerous pieces of evidence(Verbally and in writing), conducted a meticulous investigation, and above all,I talked to individuals who knew very well Hitler, such as Zarah Leander, AdolfHitler’s friend and favorite singer, and the legendary Leni Riefenstahl.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IOfficial statements about Hitler’s doubles.______________________________[image447.jpg]SS General Johann (Hans) Rattemhuber:Head of Hitler’s personal bodyguard from 1933 to 1945.

And from Hoerching, he boarded an airplane type JU290A en route to Barcelona on April 26, around 8.00 PM. The airplane landed inBarcelona on April 27, 1945. He added, “I learned from Admiral Doenitz thatHitler arrived safely to Spain.”German helicopter, Focke Achgelis, type FA 223.According to General Muller, Dr. Josef Goebbels trained Hitler’s double for anextended period of time. With the help of a cinema director from UFA, Dr.Goebbels gave the doubles lessons and extensive training on Hitler’s mannerism,voice, and demeanor, with a strong emphasis on how to walk, how to answerquestions and how to avoid answering questions. Two out of five doubles werefinally chosen by Goebbels.Eva Braun’s double.Eva Braun’s double was not so difficult to find and train. General Muller said,“Goebbels was having lots of fun training this wanna-be an actress. She wasattractive but not beautiful. And she had to be stupid. Eva Braun was not abright woman…”Muller added, “Goebbels had already decided what to do with the doubles, afterthe escape of Hitler. I did not approve. But he was in charge. Yes, I did talkto Hitler in the Chancellery’s garden about the fate of his double, he laughedand said, this would confuse Stalin…It was not my idea to eliminate the doubles.Dr. Goebbels insisted that all the doubles must die including those we did notuse. Borman approved. Goebbels was concerned with two things, the faces and theteeth of the doubles.He wanted everything to be perfect and remove any suspicions from the heads ofthe Russians.He knew the Russians will try to identify the dead bodies from dental records,so he decided to fake dental records, replace some records with other records hecould obtain from SS military clinics…even break apart their spines, exactlywhere the spine of Hitler was broken when he was injured in World War One.”Muller continues, “We did not tell the doubles that they will be sacrificed. Wejust told them it is a temporary assignment, and they had nothing to fear atall. And they believed us…one minor problem was left to be solved; the height ofthe doubles. Goebbels said, let’s work now on one double, he meant Weller,Gustave Weller. Heinz Linge took the measurement of his height. He was fivecentimeters shorter than Hitler.So, we decided to give him built-up shoes to compensate for the difference inheight. The built-in high heels were made from ceramics. Then Bormann said thatWeller needed a minor plastic surgery on his ears, nose and lower lip.So, we brought in Dr. Zeitfeld, a plastic surgeon to see what he can do…He did amagnificent job. It took him only 4 weeks to create an almost perfect double.Short after, Bormann sent his men to kill Zeitfeld and burn his clinic.The statements of General Muller were not always consistent. For example, in oneof his testimonies, General Muller said that it was him who found Hitler’sdouble and not Dr. Goebbels. He stated verbatim, “I found him (Hitler’s double)in mid-1941.He was a SA’s member…and loyal. He did look like Hitler but was shorter…and hisears were different from Hitler’s ears…”This statement seems to corroborate what Leni Riefenstahl told me about Hitler’sears. Please refer to my interview with Leni.General Mueller also told his interrogators: “The new Hitler (The double) wasdrugged by Dr. Haase, and fully controlled by Goebbels and Bormann.”*** *** ***A vintage photo of a group of people posing for the camera Description generatedwith high confidence [image498.jpg]Zarah Leander.Zarah Leander, Adolf Hitler’s friend and favorite singer, told me verbatim,“Yes, Hitler had doubles, and Eva Braun had her double too, no question aboutit.

We spoke about so many things; the Third Reich in general, andHitler, Eva Braun, Josef Goebbels, his wife Magda and the rumors surrounding theescape of Hitler, and of course her “Triumph des Willens”, and her two favoritefilms “Das Blaue Licht”, and “Die weiße Hölle vom Piz Palü” a film sheco-directed with G W Pabst.And what she told me was mind-bending. For instance:a-Hitler had a lot of respect for women.He thought women were more creative than men on an artistic level. Adolf Hitleradmired few people in his life, mostly women…Zarah Leander, he called her the“Divine Zarah”, which made Josef Goebbels a little bit jealous…Hitler had a veryspecial affection for Magda Goebbels who thought of her as the “Most perfectGerman woman”, Eva (Eva Braun) of course, Hanna Reitsch, Princess StephanieMarie von Hohenlohe’s (She was Jewish), who gave her so many gifts and acastle…and me (Leni) to a certain degree. b-Josef Goebbels was not a “pure Aryan”; he was a half-Jew.c-Hitler himself had something Jewish in him…in his blood, and he created a newfamily tree to hide that secret that haunted him all his life. His nephew,William Patrick Hitler knew about it and he was constantly blackmailing him.d-Hitler and Eva did not die in the bunker in Berlin; they escape with MartinBormann, two days before the Russians entered the bunker. I know that for sure.I don’t know all the details, nobody does.

She saw nothing.-But she was in the bunker with Hitler.Leni: She was in the bunker, I know that, but she saw nothing. When the gun-shotwas heard, and I don’t believe that either, Junge was probably typing somethingin her room…far from Hitler and Eva’s room. She said it herself, “I did not heara shot, and I did not see the Fuhrer’s body.” Linge told her that Hitlercommitted suicide.Besides how could anybody hear a shot coming from Hitler room when the room issound-proof? It is impossible.-You had some sort of a heated discussion with Traudl Junge…(Interrupted)Leni: She wanted to write her memoirs…a book. She asked me if I could contributesomething to the book, some stories or what I have talked about with Hitler andGoebbels.I told her I am not interested.And one thing led to other thing, and we ended shouting at each other. I thinkyes you could call it a heated talk, but she started it, not me. You see I don’twant to be part of any of this. I rather focus on what I am going to do next…inmy life.-Like what for instance?Leni: Documentaries, may be a series of a few photo-albums, something like that.Let me tell you something. No one, nobody who is still alive will ever dare totell the truth. Some tried and were killed. I can assure you that almost 90% ofwhat it has been said about the war is either grossly fabricated or false. Afterall, who writes history books? The winners, the victorious, not the losers, notthe defeated.Leni: Did you talk to her?-I did.Leni: So what do you think?-Think about what?Leni: Traudl Junge.-I don’t know Leni. It is too early. So 90% is false! Hitler’s suicide wasstaged. Stories about Hitler and especially his psychological profile isnonsense, as you have once said. Do you mean what was said about Hitler, and hiscruelty was not true?Leni: You are putting words in my mouth.She added, If the American government was either misled or intended on spreadingfalse information about Hitler, then I am not surprised at all that they didn’tknow a thing about his escape and the remaining years he spent in Argentina.I must admit, few in America knew about Hitler’s escape, most certainly generalswho were from the high military hierarchy, but they kept their mouths shut…theywere desperate to acquire German technology.[image965.jpg] Adolf Hitler awarding Hanna Reitsch the Iron Cross 2nd Class inMarch 1941.__________________________________"},{"pageContent":"[image976.jpg] The fuhrerbunker__________________________________"},{"pageContent":"[image986.jpg]Leni Riefenstahl with Josef Goebbels at the Berlin Olympics._____________________________________The “Double” scenario started with Goebbels.Goebbels created a special department on American films which were considered tobe either pro-Jewish or anti-Jewish. He asked me to help him in selecting someof those films and I refused.I told him I am a filmmaker and not a film historian.Then he asked me if I would go to America and meet with cinema directors inHollywood and find out what kind of films they were making about Hitler andGermany. And I said no.Finally, Georg Gyssling (Germany’s Consul in Los Angeles) was chosen to do that.Gyssling would choose American films and send them to Goebbels.You know, Goebbels was in charge of German cinema during the Third Reich and heknew lots of actresses, but he did not show any interest in men actors…and onequestion will lead to another question. He also asked me about what was specialabout Hitler’s face? Did I like his mustaches?Did I like his facial expressions? Was Adolf Hitler over acting or seems to actdramatically while delivering his speeches?And finally, he asked me if with my cinema techniques I can duplicate his face,meaning using cinema maquillage (make-up) on somebody to make him look likeHitler?I was very surprised to hear this kind of questions, and especially when heasked me whether I could make a person look like Adolf Hitler!Very candidly, I asked him if he was planning on producing a special documentaryon Adolf Hitler, or was he thinking about presenting a stage play, in which aperson should look like Adolf Hitler. And he said yes. And I believed him.Then he asked him if among the extras I used in my films, if there is a personwho could act very well and look like Hitler…to a certain degree? I said no.Then he asked if I knew any actress who looked like Eva Braun?And I said no.But without thinking or having any suspicions I said to him, Eva Braun’s face isnot difficult to duplicate. With a professional cinema or stage maquillage(make-up) I can make an actress look like Eva Braun. He smiled and saidexcellent.I asked him who is writing the scenario (The script) and the play, and hereplied: “Me! I want to surprise the Fuhrer. It is going to be a good surprise.Don’t tell anybody. It is a secret.You promise?”And I replied of course. Before leaving, I asked if I could read the script, incase if he is considering me to be the director of the film.And he replied, “I will let you know. But remember, it is a secret. Do not spoilthe surprise.” He never called me again.And I totally forgot about the whole thing, until I was arrested andinterrogated by the Americans and was asked during hideous and never-endinginterrogatories whether Hitler used a double or not.And suddenly something back-flashed in my head! Something hit me. And I knewwhat it was!!!And in seconds, I remembered all the questions Goebbels have asked me…just likethat….and especially his questions about face maquillage, and how to make aperson look like Adolf Hitler. I will never forget that moment.The military interrogator asked me again, “Did Adolf Hitler use a double?” Ithink they repeated the same question twice or three times. But I was somewhereelse.

Did she tellthe truth, the whole truth? I don’t know. Probably I will never know.But when Leni’s eyes were soaked in tears, and leaned toward me and said, “Ihave been victimized…I made lots of mistakes in my life, but I was never a Nazi,I never joined the party…. lived only for my art.” When she said that, I knewshe was telling the truth.

No, he didn’t.He was always spontaneous and fast, nothing was pre-prepared, or written down.He didn’t need to.-So why this time he did it differently?Junge: Because it was an exceptionally important document.

No, Ishould not say confused…he was rather tired, and he seemed to me as if he wasreading something he did not put all his thoughts and brilliant mind in it…hewas reading the papers with some difficulty. You have to understand everybody inthe bunker was in state of fear and shock.-Didn’t Josef Goebbels interrupt Adolf Hitler while he was dictating to you,every time Hitler seemed to read the pre-written pages with some difficulty?Junge: Yes.

Nobody would dare.-So how come Goebbels did this time?Junge: I don’t know.-Was Martin Bormann present in the room when Hitler was dictating to you?Junge: Yes.-Did he make any comment? Did he say anything to you?Junge: No, but he did add some remarks…notes…-Does Hitler usually dictate to you from written notes?Junge: No. He never did. He hated notes.-Didn’t you find it odd that he was dictating to you his will from notes?Junge: Yes and no.-How could you work for a man who murdered millions of people, and I am nottalking only about Jews, and…Junge (Interrupting): Adolf Hitler never talked to me about Jews. It was none ofmy business. I was simply a secretary.-But you did know about his mass slaughters?Junge: Only after the war.

What do you think?_________________________________________________-Did Adolf Hitler commit suicide?-No!-Did Eva Braun commit suicide?-No!-But many of those who remained in Hitler’s bunker till the last minute on April30, 1945, have confirmed that Hitler shot himself in his room on that day.Rochus Misch, the bunker’s telephone operator and one of Hitler’s bodyguardstold the media that Adolf Hitler entered his personal room, and 45 minuteslater, a shot was heard. In other words, Hitler committed suicide. Not true?-On the surface, it is true, if you focus on the shot. And it is not true, ifyou link the suicide-shot to Hitler.Rochus Misch.Some of those who stayed in the Bunker honestly believed that their fuehrer andEva Braun committed suicide, because they were not aware of the existence of twodoubles (One for Hitler and one for Eva Braun) brought to the bunker by GeneralMueller, Martin Bormann and Josef Goebbels.hitler 6 shots [image1527.jpg]Six Photos of Adolf Hitler found in the United States National Archives.

He greeted us with affection and a sad smile.He shook the hands of the women and thanked them for their loyalty and what theyhave given to Germany. A few seconds later, he told us the war is lost. It isover. And we should go home, because there is nothing anymore we can do… Thewomen did not want to leave the bunker…”Misch adds, “On April 22, 1945, Hitler said, ‘The war is lost. No one is obligedto do anything any more…And after he said farewell to all of us, he entered hisprivate room with Eva Braun. Forty five minutes later, we heard a shot. It wasover. I opened the door and saw Hitler slumped by the table. But I did not seeblood on his face.He added, “Yes, I saw with his my own eyes the dead body of Hitler, secondsafter he committed suicide. Bormann ordered 2 SS to wrap Hitler in a blanket.Afterward, he was taken outside and burned. That was the end…”On May 1, 1945, Misch asked Dr. Joseph Goebbels if there was something, anything“he could do or anything left for him to do.” Goebbels replied: “We haveunderstood how to live, and now we will also understand how to die.” Mischcontinues, “On May 2, 1945, at 6 AM, I disabled the telephone system in theFuehrer’s bunker, and afterward I left through a window in the cellar. I wascaught and taken prisoner by a Russian soldier.Misch said that he was the first to enter Hitler’s private room. And who wasthe last person to enter Hitler’s room?Martin Bormann of course.Why?Because Bormann was already inside the room. He was the one who fired the blankshot. So, he had to get out of the room from the back without being seen, turnaround the bunker and re-enter the bunker…Misch said that on April 22, he saw with his own eyes the dead body of Hitler,seconds after he committed suicide. Others, who were fanatic Nazis lied to themilitary investigators and intel agents for obvious reasons. Martin Bormann andJosef Goebbels instructed/ordered them to tell the Russians and the Americansthat de facto, Hitler committed suicide.The gun-shot.An act of suicide was committed, but in reality it was a homicide, for first,the person who committed suicide was not Hitler at all; he was a double, andsecond, he was murdered either by Martin Bormann or one of his Nazi thugs.Inside the bunker, civilians and military men heard a gun-shot alright, but noneof them knew that Hitler and Eva Braun have already left the bunker, accordingto the escape pre-planned by Bormann and Goebbels.Bormann and Goebbels needed such witnesses to the suicide of their “fake” fuhrer(The double) to cover-up the escape of Hitler.According to an author who wrote a book on Hitler’s escape, Rochus Misch toldhim “I saw Hitler slumped by the table. I did not see any blood on his head.And I saw Eva lying next to him on the sofa, with her knees drawn up. Hitler wastaken outside to be burnt.

According to an article published in The Washington Post,”Margaret Thatcher herself once made fun of Hugh Trevor-Roper.After she asked him in front of others when she could expect his next book, hesaid he actually had one “on the stocks.”She replied, “On the stocks? On the stocks? A fat lot of good that is!

(To insiders and to thewell-informed, until the last act of his planned and staged suicide and escapefrom the bunker.)Those Nazis claimed to be the witnesses of the events that occurred inside thebunker right before it was captured by the Russians (The Red Amy).In other words, they are the first and only Nazis who saw with their own eyes“everything”, including what has happened to Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun in thebunker. Many of those witnesses were not accessible to Major Ropert (Thesewitnesses are the essential ones); he could not interview the essentialwitnesses because they were in Russian custody, such as: * Gestapo Chief, General Mueller, * SS Obergruppenfuhrer Johann (Hans) Rattenhuber, * SS Obersturmbannfuhrer Harry Mengershausen, * SS Sturmbannfuhrer Otto Gunsche.Nota Bene: Years after the end of the war, we learned that the most vital andimportant testimonies and accounts about Adolf Hitler’s alleged suicide weregiven by General Mueller, General Rattenhuber, Harry Mengershausen (Member ofAdolf Hitler’s personal guard), and Gunsche to their Russian interrogatorsbetween 13 May and 20 May 1945, and Ropert had no access to the Russianinterrogations files and dossiers.In addition, none of the assumed major players in the cover-up such as Dr.Goebbels, Martin Bormann, General Krebs, General Wilhelm Emanuel Burgdorf, Lt.Colonel Franz Schadle, and Ewald Lindloff, were interviewed by Major Ropertbecause they did not survive the war.[image1738.jpg]General Burgdorf______________________________Thus, Ropert’s interviews with Else Krueger, Gerda Christian, and Erich Kempkaand the information he obtained from those interviews are neither complete norauthoritative, because these three witnesses, practically and basically knewnothing about what went on inside Hitler’s room.

I knew then that I have to cooperate even if I have to lie.And I said to him, yes, I was in the bunker. Then he added, and you heard theshot, right? I replied yes. And he added, and you entered the room immediatelyand saw Hitler dead, correct? I said yes, correct. The man in civilian clothessaid to me, “Bormann was not in the room of Adolf Hitler when you discovered thebody of Hitler, right?Without thinking I replied yes.The interrogator added, “Bormann was already dead…we know, we found his deadbody near a bridge. He was shot in the head, shoulders and legs. You will saythat! Wouldn’t you?” Yes, I will say that, what else you want to me say, I askedhim.He replied, “That would be sufficient.” It was obvious to me that that somesort of a cover-up was in the making…” But I had to cooperate; my life was onthe line. “For the record: * 1-Major Trevor-Ropert never conducted a forensic investigation to confirm the suicide of Hitler and determine the cause of death of Hitler and Eva Braun, simply because the bodies of Hilter and Eva Braun were never found. Major Hugh Trevor-Ropert had no physical evidence! * 2-Major Trevor-Ropert’s report was based upon statements from Nazis who were extremely loyal to Adolf Hitler, and who took part in the cover-up of the suicide and escape of Hitler. * 3-The statements of those Nazi and so-called witnesses of the suicide of Hitler were filled with contradictions and discrepancies. * 4-Major Trevor-Ropert put a strong emphasis on testimonies and accounts of witnesses and occupants of the bunker, rotating specifically around what went on inside the room of Hitler, the “crime scene”! None of them was inside Hitler’s room when he allegedly shot himself. Consequently, none of them could have known what de facto went on inside Hitler’s room at the time of the shooting. * 5-Major Hugh Trevor-Ropert interviewed the wrong “so-called” witnesses of Hitler’s suicide, because all of them stated publicly that they were neither inside Hitler’s room nor near the room at the time of the shooting. For instance, he interviewed Gerda Christian, Hitler’s secretary about the suicide of Hitler, who made it clear to him that she was neither inside the room nor nearby the room. Borman’s secretary, Else Krueger said the very same thing. In fact, both secretaries testified that they heard about Hitler’s suicide from other occupants of the bunker, and Hilter’s aides such as Otto Guensche and Heinz Linge. * 6-Major Trevor-Ropert never tried –or possibly never wanted– to discern, to verify and to explain events lack of veracity, events’ correct time-occurrences, events’ wrong time-occurrences, and the testimony/statement of Erich Kempka, especially contradictions in testimonies by witnesses he interrogated, and pertaining to the same events(s) and the date(s) of those events.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"Chapter XForensic Evidenceaa [image1792.jpg]The remaining fragments from the skull of Adolf Hitler, according to theRussians._______________________________Death of Hitler based upon his skull with a bullet hole in it.Fragments from the skull of Hitler?Really? Impossible!This skull belongs to a young Russian woman, according to recent DNA analysis.The Russians claimed that what you see above are the remaining fragments fromthe skull of Adolf Hitler. They kept these remains for almost 60 years in a cardbox, in their state archives.[image1803.jpg]The alleged skull of Adolf Hitler, according to the Russians.________________________________It is ironic and puzzling, for Stalin kept on claiming ad infinitum that Hitlerhas escaped from Germany.How an intelligent person could possibly explain the Russian multiple versionsand the denial of Stalin. Is it the skull of Hitler as claimed by the KGB andNKVD, or it is not, since Stalin have said so many times that Hitler has escapedfrom the bunker, either to Spain or Argentina?The Russians can’t have it both ways!!The Russians never ever produced or released photos of the alleged dead andburned bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun! So where is the proof that Hitlercommitted suicide?None whatsoever!History or legend has it that Adolf Hitler committed suicide by gunshot onMonday, April 30, 1945 in his führerbunker in Berlin. A small fragment from hisskull with a bullet hole in it, which was kept in the Russian KGB and NKBDsecret archives, seems to convince many military historians that de facto,Hitler shot himself.For years everybody believed that Hitler was 6 foot under. But, recent DNAmeticulous study of the alleged skull revealed that it couldn’t be Hitler’sskull, simply because it belonged to a young Russian woman!!From the Guardian and the Observer:The Guardian and the Observer stated (A Headline): “Tests on skull fragment castdoubt on Adolf Hitler suicide story. Bone with bullet hole found by Russians in1946 came from an unknown woman, not the German leader.”The Guardian added, “Some historians expressed doubt that the Führer had shothimself, speculating that accounts of Hitler’s death had been embellished topresent his suicide in a suitably heroic light.But a fragment of skull, complete with bullet hole, which was taken from thebunker by the Russians and displayed in Moscow in 2000, appeared to settle theargument. American researchers claim to have demonstrated that the skullfragment, secretly preserved for decades by Soviet intelligence, belonged to awoman under 40, whose identity is unknown.DNA analyses performed on the bone, now held by the Russian State Archive inMoscow, have been processed at the genetics lab of the University ofConnecticut. The results, broadcast in the US by a History Channel documentary,Hitler’s Escape , astonished scientists.” According to Connecticut archaeologistand bone specialist Nick Bellantoni, it was clear from the outset that somethingwas amiss.The bone seemed very thin; male bone tends to be more robust,” he said. “And thesutures where the skull plates come together seemed to correspond to someoneunder 40.”*** *** ***Excerpts from the Associated Press by Pat Eaton-Robb.Headline: Scientists: Skull piece that Russian officials say came from Hitler'sbody actually from woman.A piece of skull with a bullet hole through it that Russian officials claimedbelonged to Adolf Hitler actually came from a woman, scientists at theUniversity of Connecticut concluded.Connecticut archaeologist Nick Bellantoni was asked to examine the skull andblood samples for a History Channel documentary on Hitler's death that airedthis month. Bellantoni said his initial forensic exam of the skull fragment showed it didn'tmatch what he knew of Hitler's biology. “The bone was very small and thin, andnormally male bones are much more robust in our species,” Bellantoni saidTuesday. “I thought it probably came from a woman or a younger man.” Bellantonithen took several pinhead-size pieces of the skull fragment and swabs of theblood stains back to the university for analysis.Linda Strausbaugh, a professor of molecular and cell biology, got help from twoformer students who work in the New York City medical examiner's office. Theformer students, Craig O'Connor and Heather Nelson, are experts in working withchallenging DNA samples and were able to extract enough DNA from the bone piecesto do a forensic study, Strausbaugh said.She said they determined that the DNA came from a 20-to 40-year-old woman. Theskull fragment could have come from Braun, but to know that, the lab would needsamples of her DNA, she said. Also, the DNA samples were very degraded, makingidentification unlikely, Strausbaugh said.Witnesses never reported Braun being shot in the head, Bellantoni said, and sheis thought to have died of cyanide poisoning. “This person, with a bullet holecoming out the back of the head, would have been shot in the face, in the mouthor underneath the chin,” he said. “It would have been hard for them to missthat.”*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"Hitler’s Corpse False Teeth.[image1840.jpg] _____________________________Part from Adolf Hitler's upper teeth in 1945, as produced to the world by theRussians.

Goebbels was concerned with two things, the faces and theteeth of the doubles.He wanted everything to be perfect and remove any suspicions from the heads ofthe Russians.He knew the Russians will try to identify the dead bodies from dental records,so he decided to fake dental records, replace some records with other records hecould obtain from SS military clinics…even break their spines, exactly where thespine of Hitler was broken when he was injured in World War One.”[image1850.jpg]Dr. Heusermann’s sketch of Adolf Hitler’s teeth, on May 11, 1945._______________________________________"},{"pageContent":"[image1862.jpg] [image1866.jpg] [image1870.jpg] Five X-ray plates of AdolfHitler found in the records ofDr. Morell, Hitler’s personal physician._________________________________________Upon an order from the Americans, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, Hitler’s dentist prepareddescriptions and diagrams of the dental condition of Adolf Hitler, whichincluded teeth that were present, restored, decayed, extracted, replaced, andlost, including all porcelain fillings, as well as diagrammatic profile of theteeth from the buccal and the labial aspects of both the upper and lower jaws.He did, but he wrote his notes from memory.See on the next page:Copy of page 1 summarizing the notes written by Dr. Hugo Blaschke on Hitler’steeth.

Despite thischarade and lack of any forensic evidence, the Russians tried to find“something”, by examining the teeth of the burned body. They hoped against allodds that the teeth could or would identify the body of Hitler. But they werefacing a major problem. They did not have any pertinent dental record (s).Besides, they were unable to find Dr. Hugo Blaschke.So what they did was the following, in a chronological order:a-They removed the lower jaw and what was left from the bridge.b-They began to look for Hitler’s dentist, whom they discovered was Dr. HugoBlaschke, but could not interrogate him, for he was already in the Americans’custody.(He was captured in Salzburg on May 28, 1945).c-They raided on Dr. Blaschke’s clinic, hoping to find Hitler’s dental records,and again, no records were found, simply because Adolf Hitler, from his firstvisit to his dentist, issued an order to confiscate all his medical and dentalrecords and to keep them in his personal files at the Chancellery.*** *** ***[image1894.jpg]Report of Dr. Hugo Johannes Blaschke on the teeth of Hitler.This is a fact which was later documented by General Mueller.Destroying Hitler’s personal papers and files is a historical fact; SS CaptainSchwaegermann burned the room/study of Hitler in his bunker and destroyedHitler’s files according to Hitler’s bunker technician Hentschel, and upon adirect order from SS General Mohnke. And Julius Schaub, Hitler’s adjutant andchief aide was ordered by Hitler to burn all his personal papers and personalbelongings from the bunker and the Reichskanzlei.As to hiding or destroying medical records, this was a “standard practice”, aHitler’s typical habit to remove his medical records and pertinent documentsfrom all the clinics and hospitals he visited.On the Canadian CBC television show “As It Happens”.On September 17, 1974, on the Canadian CBC television show “As It Happens” Dr.Ryder Saguenay, oral surgeon and professor at the University of California atLos Angeles, said, “Adolf Hitler ordered a special plane to leave from Berlincarrying all the medical and dental records, and especially the X-rays of allthe top Nazis to an unknown destination.”In one of his statements, Dr. Ryder Saguenay said that “The dental records usedto identify Hitler's corpse were drawn from memory by Dr. Hugo Blaschke’s dentalassistant, who was pressured by the Russians to identify the corpse’s teeth andjaws, and this assistant was later killed by the Russians.”Dr. Hugo Blaschke, Hitler’s dentist told his military interrogators in 1945,“This plane never arrived at Salzburg, and from the Obersalzberg it could neverbe ascertained what had become of it.” Hitler’s personal physician, Dr. TheodorMorell confirmed the story of Dr. Hugo Blaschke. More on this on the followingpages.d-Upon learning that Dr. Hugo Blaschke was in the custody of the Americans, theRussians began to search for his assistants, who apparently did some minor workon Hitler’s teeth. And they found two: Kate (Kaethe) Hausermann and FritzEchtmann.3-The Russians ordered Kaethe Hausermann to identify the teeth and jaws of thecorpse, and to sketch Hitler’s dental work (Teeth) from memory, and which theydid. But her sketches were very different from the notes and sketches of Dr.Blaschke, the dentist she worked for.[image1908.jpg]Dr. Theodor Morell, Hitler’s physician.[image1913.jpg]Kate (Kaethe) Hausermann.4-Upon the completion of Kaethe Hausermann’s sketches of the assumed Hitler’steeth and dental work, the Russians falsely claimed that they have foundHitler’s dental records in Dr. Hugo Blaschke’s clinic, despite the fact that nodental records were ever found, and their knowledge of General Mueller’sdestruction of Hitler’s medical and dental records.Part of the Russian claim was based upon a telegram they received from GeneralDonovan, then head of the OSS, dated July 28, 1945, which contained Dr. HugoBlaschke’s notes and description of Adolf Hitler’s teeth.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"The big problem with the teeth/jaws identification.________________________________Both Americans and Russians faced un fait accompli ; no solid forensic evidence(s).●1-The Russians got the body (and the teeth) and captured two technicalassistants who worked at Dr. H. Blaschke’s clinic, but did not have the dentalrecords of Hitler. The Americans got Dr. H. Blaschke, but no dental records wereever found, because they were already destroyed.●2-Dr. Hugo Blaschke on the American side reconstructed Hitler’s dental recordsfrom memory, and on the Russian side, Dr. Hugo Blaschke’s assistants alsoreconstructed Hitler’s dental records from memory.The Americans and the Russians had no postmortem and ante-mortem data for dentalcomparison. The 1945 Russian autopsy of the burned body (Assumingly Hitler’sbody) lacked ante-mortem dental evidence and scientific-forensic comparison datarelated to an absolute and irrefutable postmortem identification of AdolfHitler.Some have claimed that the United States files on the 1945 interrogations of Dr.Hugo Blaschke, which can be found in the Captured Records Branch of the UnitedStates National Archives and Records Service in Washington, D.C., and the fiveauthenticated X Ray plates of Hitler’s head and jaws taken right after theassassination attempt of Hitler in 1944, proved beyond the shadow of a doubtthat the skull, the jaws and the teeth believed to be those of Hitler are Notthe remains of Adolf Hitler. This could be factual to a certain degree, butaccording to Dr. Hugo Blaschke, the dental records of Hitler have disappearedfrom the face of the Earth before the end of World War Two. He is convinced thatGeneral Mueller got hold of the dental records, as well as other medical recordspertaining to Adolf Hitler.In his interrogations by the Americans, Dr. Blaschke stated that on April 20 or21, 1945, in the Chancellery in Berlin, he was ordered to pack and leave with“minimum baggage” in less than one hour.[image1936.jpg] American war correspondents are shown the place where AdolfHitler's alleged burned body was buried and found by the Red Army, right behindthe Chancellery in Berlin.__________________________________________He told his interrogators, “I was helped in packing the little portable dentalstation which I wanted to take with me by my dental helper Mrs. KaetheHeusermann and my assistant Dr. Rohkamm…my baggage was then supposed to be sentfrom Tempelfof field to Salzburg in a transport plane carrying baggageexclusively.This plane never arrived at Salzburg, and from the Obersalzberg it could neverbe ascertained what had become of it.”Hitler’s personal physician, Dr. Theodor Morell confirmed the story of Dr. HugoBlaschke during his interrogations by the Americans.In a top-secret addendum to OI FIR (Final Interrogation Report) 31 and 32, whichwas still available in 1945 and 1946, and which disappeared in late 1946, Dr.Blaschke told his military interrogators, “I can’t for sure identify the teethof Hitler from other medical reports. I am sure the Russians don’t have theteeth and jaws of Hitler.First, they don’t match my recollection (Note: Here the lines are not clear) of…and second, it would be impossible for my assistants to identify and match whatthe Russians claim to have, simply because they did not work on Hitler’s teeth…”Dr. Robert Dorian’s report:According to Dr. Robert Dorian, an authority in the field, and Director ofForensic Dentistry for the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Quebec, inMontreal, Canada, who examined the notes of Blaschke and his assistants, andmeticulously compared the photos of Hitler corpse’s teeth and jaw withnumerous close-up open-mouthed photos of Hitler’s taken throughout his life,concluded that there are enormous differences between the photos of the corpse’steeth/jaws and previous open-mouthed photos of Hitler.Dr. R. Dorian confirmed that Adolf Hitler had a root canal and porcelain tooth.The photos of the corpse’s teeth/jaws found in the Russian files did not show upa root canal and a porcelain tooth. He also noticed that the corpse had a lowerbridge work very different from the bridge work Hitler had before his allegedsuicide.Thus, he concluded that the jaws and teeth of the corpse did not match AdolfHitler’s previous photos he carefully examined. This statement was confirmed byDr. Hugo Blaschke when he told his military interrogators that he did notinstall (Himself) the two lowers bridges. Dr. Blaschke added that he performed aroot canal, while the Russian photo of the corpse did not reveal any root canal.Dr. Erwin Giesing’s report:In November 1971, Dr. Erwin Giesing who treated Adolf Hitler’s shatteredeardrums caused by the bomb plot, stated publicly that Hitler’s teeth X-raypictures were totally and entirely different from the X ray plates allegedlytaken by the Russians during the autopsy of Hitler’s corpse in Moscow.And he concluded that the medical reports, the X ray plates and the findings ofthe corpse’s autopsy were a fake! In other words, Dr. Giesing denounced theSoviet odontology report of Hitler's teeth.*** *** ***"},{"pageContent":"FROM THE ALBUM[image1961.jpg]Admiral Karl Doenitz with Hitler in Hitler’s bunker in 1945._____________________________[image1968.jpg] Hitler’s bunker after it was demolished in 1947._____________________________"},{"pageContent":"[image1979.jpg] The Reichstag after its capture by the Red Army on June 3, 1945.____________________________________"},{"pageContent":"Hitler’s apartment.___________________________________________The building housing Hitler’s apartment at No. 16, Prinzregentenstrasse.Traudl Junge [image1992.jpg]*** *** ***Traudl Junge in 2002.In 2002, Mrs. Junge told me: “We did receive a message from Maria Orsic, and itwas delivered to Mrs. Goebbels by Inge Schulz… Bormann read it first…”____________________________________________________[image2002.jpg]From left to right: Magda Goebbels, Adolf Hitler, Minister of propaganda, Dr.Josef Goebbels, and three of their children in the Bavarian Alps.______________________________________"},{"pageContent":"[image2014.jpg] Soldiers of the Red Army displaying the dead bodies of thedaughters of Josef Goebbels, poisoned by Dr. Helmut Kunz.

There is no way in the world would you be able to summon andcommunicate with spirits, Djinns, Afarit, demons and even Noble Souls if you arenot familiar with the terminology, vocabulary and phraseology of their languagesand the Sihr language. This book will teach you all of the above, and provideyou with most useful phrases needed in your conversation with summoned spiritsand entities. It is easy, fun, and fast!Almost 90% of the words, expressions and sentences found in thisglossary/vocabulary are commonly, frequently and jointly used by Al Sahiriin(Sorcerers), Al Rouhaniyiin (Spiritists), Mounawariin (Enlightened), andpractitioners of witchcraft in the Middle East, the Near East, and North Africa,to summon and to communicate with Arwaah (Spirits), Mawtah (Dead people), Djinn,Afarit, Shayatiin (Demons or Evil Entities), and various non-physical entitieswhich have not departed yet, crossed over, and which are still trapped in Bilaya(Doomed Zones of trapped spirits of dead people, and even our beloved pets). Itis extremely important and paramount to understand that in this context, we areexclusively referring to old spirits (Arwaah) and entities which existed andstill exist in the archaic spiritist realm of the ancient world of theMiddle/Near East, Pre-Islam, and Islam.Those who are familiar with dead languages and languages of the ancient world ofthe Middle East, Near East and Anatolia will immediately notice that many wordsin the spirits and etheric multi-dimensional entities' languages are frequentlyfound in various languages and scriptures of the ancient world, such asAkkadian, Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Ugaritic, Byblos Script of Phoenicia,Ana'kh (Anunnaki's language), Aramaic, Hebrew and Arabic.Those Arwaah and entities could be summoned only if they are contacted in theirancient languages, some of which were written down and preserved in Arabic andSahiriin texts, and shrouded in secrecy for centuries. However, our departedrelatives, parents, friends and even pets could be contacted, and/or reachedwithout using any of the Sahiriin's languages. It is very logical, since ourdeparted ones did not speak the archaic languages of the Arwaah of the ancientworld. If your departed ones spoke English, French or Spanish for instance, youcan contact them in any of these languages, as long as they did not traverse yetthe \"40 Day Period\" after they passed away. Once they have left the zone of the40 day period to another dimension, no one, no psychic, no medium, and nopractitioner of the black or white arts can contact them. In other words, if youwant to contact John Doe who spoke English, in English, go ahead withouthesitation, because you are using a language he perfectly understands. You can'tcontact him in a language he is not familiar with. Remember there are no foreignlanguages schools and tapes for learning a foreign language in the afterlife. Ifyou want to contact Mr. Ahmad X or Y, who spoke only Arabic, then you must tryto reach him in Arabic. And if you want to contact an ancient spirit fromBabylon or Sidon, then you must communicate with that spirit in Babylonian orPhoenician. And if you want to contact a Djinn or an Afarit, then you mustcontact them in one of their own languages which we have included in this book.[image2160.jpg]5th Edition.

Many students and friends have asked me if thereis an immediate way to solve the harsh financial problems they are facing; somesort of an Anunnaki Ulema relief-technique to bring them wealth, make themsucceed in business, get rid of their troubles, and reach their goals. The enlightened masters told us that there is only one way, one technique, onemethod to reach Alsoudk (Truth) and Iftirach (Happiness), which are the mostimportant reasons, cause and effect of our intellectual and spiritual ascension.And through this ascension, our eyes will open up, our mind will develop, ourheart will expand, and our being, physically, spiritually and mentally willenter the zone of ultimate knowledge; a knowledge which is an intricate part ofthe state of “Oneness”, reachable only through our “Conduit” and “SupersymnetricMind”. Yes, of course, enlightenment could be achieved differently, usingalternative methods and paths, as explained by Brahmans, Lamas, Gurus, Swamis,Senseis, spiritual guides, and others. But no path and no alternative method areas sublime and flawless as the Anunnaki Ulema’s Tarika (Road or Way ofKnowledge). And yes, you can walk on that road, and reach the hill of light, ifyou get rid of the Tabi’a, the lowest level of your mind, where the human natureis stained by weaknesses, nourished with vanity and greed, and solely breeds onattachment to materialistic values. When you confer with your “SupersymetricMind”, and when you activate your “Conduit”, even partially, you will be able toaccomplish the quasi-impossible. This book is not the ultimate and entire mental and esoteric arsenal you need inyour fight against ignorance, nor the Alpha and Omega of the enlightenmentTarika, but it could help you a lot in finding and developing extraordinarymental and supernatural powers you had within you since you were born, but younever knew that you had them, or you could have used them when you needed animmediate relief, a helping hand, and a strong shoulder to lean on. This book will show you a few techniques that could activate part of your“Conduit”, and teach you how to converse with your “Supersymetric Mind”, whichis the original blueprints of your intelligence (Hidden and known), and theamazingly vast depot of knowledge and know-how, which were given to you, but youhave never used, simply because you didn’t know that such depot did exist, andyou were rightfully entitled to have access to. Your mind is a magnificent tool,a superb machine, an unimaginable instrument you can use to solve lots ofproblems on so many levels, to strengthen your faith in yourself, and to reachfor the stars. Those stars are not very far away from you, for you can reachthem, for you can touch them, if you use your Conduit and “Supersymetric Mind”. *** *** ***[image2242.jpg]23 rd Edition (Condensed & Revised): THE BOOK OF RAMADOSH. 13 Anunnaki UlemaTechniques To Live Longer, Happier, Healthier, Wealthier\"Book of Ramnadosh\" is the ULTIMATE Book of the ANUNNAKI ULEMA and AscendedMasters.

[image2273.jpg]The origin of the name of God and his true identity. Synopsis and Translation ofthe Phoenician, Ugaritic, Canaanite, Sumerian, Akkadian, and Assyrian Tablets.The name of God \"Yahweh\", his attributes and extraordinary (Supernatural) powersand deeds were borrowed from pagans' gods; gods the Israelites worshiped beforethey \"created\" their own god \"Yahweh\", who centuries later, became the God ofthe Christians and the Muslims. So is it fair and logical to assume that we areworshiping a \"Pagans' God\" or more precisely an amalgam of mythical gods? Youbet! And this is exactly, the delicate, fragile and controversial topic we willbe exploring, discussing and explaining in this treatise. If you are fanaticallyreligious and you believe every word in the Bible, and all the stories rabbis,sheiks, Imams, bishops and priests tell you, then, do not read this treatise,because it could disturb you, and lead you to believe that it was written todiscredit your faith and your beliefs in the Jewish Bible, the Torah, Talmud,the Christian Bible (New Testament), Jesus, the Christian Church, the Koran, andthe Prophets. And this is not the case at all. The conclusions are based uponlinguistic, historical, geographical, and archaeological facts and irrefutablefindings, scrolls and inscriptions written centuries before any organizedreligion was established on Earth, and the word \"GOD\" was ever pronounced by orknown to mankind.[image2279.jpg]How the Babylonian Story of the Flood Became the Story of the Great Deluge inthe Bible.
