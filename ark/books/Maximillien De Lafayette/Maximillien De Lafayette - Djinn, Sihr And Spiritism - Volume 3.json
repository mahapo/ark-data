The 4th Dimension is where the mindnavigates freely. Your physical body cannot enter the 4 th dimension. However, the righteous Ulema can physically enter the 4 th Dimension for a very short time.

In the 4th Dimension, there is a real reflection of everything that exists on earth. A real reflection means an identical presence in substance and properties of all physical things on Earth. But they exist at a different vibrational level. A vibrational level is what constitutes the substance of any object or matter in the universe, including thoughts, intentions, and events that did not happen yet. The vibrations on Earth can be detected, but not all of them. The mind vibrations and waves’ frequencies can be detected on Earth. But the vibrations that have created the mind in the first place are undetectable by humans. If for some unknown reasons, you were able to enter the 4th Dimension, and if you were not guided by a higher presence (Supreme entities, highly advanced non –terrestrial beings, etc.) your body will be exposed to tremendous physical and non-physical pressures."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"This could cause loss of memory and blindness. It did happen, and we are mentioning it here for additional learning, but it is not useful to elaborate further on this situation. Now, if you were brought to the 4th Dimension (The Rabiiya) by non- terrestrial benevolent beings, your journey will be very pleasant and enlightening. This could happen in two ways, and only two ways: a-Via a galactic multi-dimensional Markabah. This spaceship does not travel or traverse distances and dimensions. It “jumps” from one time pocket to another time pocket on the map of the universe. In front of the spaceship, time and space as two separate physical dimensions cease to exist. They cancel each other. This allows the spaceship to reach higher spheres at an incredible speed way beyond the comprehension of human beings. Behind the spaceship, time and space open and close up as soon as the spaceship exits from the time-space tunnel that allowed the spaceship to reach the 4th Dimension, or the parallel one."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"b-Via Tay Al Ard technique or the projection of the mind. Only Ulema and the enlightened ones who learned these techniques from non-terrestrial beings can do that. The 4th Dimension is incomprehensible, because it has a semi start-line, but not a finish-line. Beyond the 4th Dimension exists the 5th Dimension which is the realm of the purified entities. No physical substances exist in the 5th Dimension, only their codes. Yet, in the 4th Dimension, many physical forms retain their physical properties. Humans will spend many many years in the 4th Dimension before they reach a higher one. Many humans (Minds or Souls) could get lost around the perimeter of the 4th Dimension. Humans who just arrive in spirit or in mind to the 4th Dimension have two choices and decisions to make within 40 days: a- To stay in the 4th Dimension and evolve, b- To return to Earth."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Those who decide to stay in the 4th Dimension will be taken to an area similar to the Anunnaki’s Miraya Hall. They will receive orientation and guidance from supreme beings (from much higher dimensions) who come to visit them and lecture them. Those who began to progress and evolve spiritually in the 4 th Dimension will be acknowledged. Their spiritual/etheric progress will elevate their mental vibrations, thus allowing them to see loved ones, and to enjoy the company of delightful higher beings. It could take a person thousands of years (in terrestrial term) to evolve. But time does not exist in higher dimensions, not even the perception of time. Some could evolve rapidly and elevate themselves to the 5 th Dimension; the sphere of absolute beauty and happiness.

The Chavad-nitrin, as well as Mah’rit were frequently used by athletes and pugilists in Ugarit, Amrit, and Arwad. From Chavad-nitrin, derived the Greek word Natron or Natrin, a substance used in the embalming process. Because of the amazing results of Anunnaki- Phoenician Chavadnitrin, and its effects on both the dead and the living, the Egyptians associated the words Neter, Netjer and Netjet with the immortality of the gods.

According to Ulema Al Badr, Chavad-nitrin was also called “Nitra-elim”, and “Mayii-nitra- elim”which means the water of the gods, given by the Primordial Angels and Beings of Light (Noble Spirits) to the Ascended Master and the Enlightened Ones.

This technique eliminates stress, through one’s “Self-energy”, by concentrating on the circle you create in your mind, during the first stage of your exercise. In other words, it is an Anunnaki-Ulema technique used to energize one’s mind and body, and to eliminate worries and fear that are preventing an individual from focusing, concentrating, and functioning properly everywhere, including the office, home, social gatherings, etc. This technique is used by Sahirrin, Spiritualists, and Rouhaniyiin in order to intensify and strengthen their communication with particular Arwaah (Spirits)."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Dha-kiliyan: Name for the early quasi-humans who were genetically created by the Anunnaki goddesses (Aruru’s clan) as “Experimental Beings”.

Your Double that co-existed with you in your physical dimension was never physically attached to your body. In many instances, and for a very long period, your “Double” has remained distant from your physical body for many reasons. But in general, your “Double” stays very close to you. The distance separating your Double from your physical body depends on your health condition. It is very healthy and even necessary to keep your Double at a close proximity of your body.

It is like recharging a dead battery. Your Double knows very well how your body functions, far more and better than any physician. People who die in a brutal accident or commit suicide, their Double becomes instantly impaired and dysfunctional at the time of their death. Suicide is wrong. Tragic death and suicide confuse and disorient your Double. Disorienting your Double is harmful to your mind. And because your mind is your vehicle to the other world, you should avoid anything or anyone that could cause you a tragic, painful and sudden death."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The body has its wounds. The mind has wounds too, but you can’t see them. Your Double does. If you have not caused your own death, but suffered a lot at the time of your death, and your Double was far away from you, your passage to the other world will not be pleasant at all. In normal situation such as death of a natural cause, the passage to the other world takes its normal course, at the end of the Double’s self-judgment and assessment of deeds, actions and thoughts of the deceased. When a bad person dies, he/she immediately faces his/her Double. In this instance, the Double acts as a conscience and as a judge. The Double is the real persona of the human being. Everything we have in our body and mind came from our Double. Even though, some of our mental and physical faculties and properties are usually damaged on Earth for various reasons, such as illness, malnutrition, fear, prejudices, tortures, confusion,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"etc., the original faculties in our Double are immune, because the physical cannot affect the non-physical, nor reach any dimension beyond the “Zinar” (Belt of Earth).

It is also a reference made to “Lost Souls”, and/or “Trapped Souls”, in ancient Middle Eastern civilizations. It is most certain, that the Anunnaki’s depiction of Dybukur has influenced the writings of the early Hebrew scribes. From the Anunnaki’s word Dybukur, derived the Hebrew word Dybbuk, which is the name of a vicious possessing spirit.

From Eido-Rah, derived the Greek word Eidolon (A phantom). According to the “Book of Rama- Dosh”, after we die, the primordial source of energy in our body leaves our body.

The first places, the mind (Or the new form- substance of the deceased one) searches for, and/or tries to return to, are the familiar places such as home, office, recreation center, church, mosque, synagogue, temple, etc...but the most sought place is usually home.

Some deceased people will keep on trying to contact their beloved ones left behind for a period of 40 days. After that, the deceased dissipates, and no further attempts to establish contact are made. In another passage of the Book of Ramadosh, we read (Verbatim): “Although, it is impossible to reach the deceased one as soon as he/she leaves the body, and/or during the Arba’iin (The 40 days period following his or her death), sometimes, if we are lucky, and/or were extremely attached to the person we lost, a short contact with him or with her is still possible if we pay attention to unusual things happening around us; those unusual things are difficult to notice, unless we pay a great attention.

Many linguists define Elohim as a plural of majesty. Ethiopic literature considered it as a rank and referred to it as Amlak, which later became the proper name of God.

This can be done through seeing the information/data stored on the two lines of the person’s Khateyn Tarika. According to the doctrine and Kira’at of the Ulema, the soul is an invention of early humans, who needed to believe in a next life. It was through the soul that mortals could and would hope to continue to live after death. Soul as an element or a substance does not exist anywhere inside the human body. Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes the brain function, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul. The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the time they created the final form of the human race. Fik’r was not used in the early seven prototypes of the creation of mankind according to the Sumerian texts. Although the “Fik’r” is the primordial source of life for our physical body, it is not to be considered as DNA, because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is the physical description of our"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"genes, a sort of a series of formulas, numbers and sequences of what there in our body, the data and history of our genes, genetic origin, ethnicity, race, so on. Thus Fik’r includes DNA. The Honorable Ulema said: “Consider Fik’r as a cosmic-sub-atomicintellectual-extraterrestrial (Meaning non-physical, non-earthly) depot of all what it constituted, constitutes and shall continue to constitute everything about you. And it is infinitesimally small. However, it can expand to an unimaginable dimension, size and proportions. It stays alive and continues to grow after we pass away, if it is still linked to the origin of its creation, in our case the Anunnaki. The Fik’r is linked to our creators the Anunnaki through a “Conduit” found in the cells of the brain. For now, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble. After death, this bubble leaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as the bubble leaves the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"body. The body dies because the bubble leaves the body. Immediately, with one tenth of one million of a second, the molecule or the bubble frees itself from any and everything physical, including the atmosphere, the air, and the light; absolutely everything we can measure, and everything related to Earth, including its orbit. The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to stand judgment and await the decision of God -whether you have to go to heaven or hell– because there is no hell and there is no heaven the way we understand hell and heaven. So it does not matter whether you are a Muslim, a Christian, a Jew, a Buddhist or a believer in any other religion. The molecule (Bubble) enters the original blueprint of “YOU”; meaning the first copy, the first sketch, the first formula that created you. Humans came from a blueprint, and each one of us has a Double. Your double is a copy stored in the “Rouh Plasma”."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Rouh-Plasma is an enormous compartment under the control of the Anunnaki, and can be transported to another star. And this double is immortal. In this context, the human being is also immortal, because its Double never dies. Once the molecule re-enters your original copy (Which is the original You), you come back to life with all your faculties, including your memory, but without physical, emotional and sensorial properties (The properties you had on earth), because they are not perfect.” Ulema Sadiq said: “At that time, and only at that time, will you decide whether you want to stay in your Double or go somewhere else, the universe is yours. If your past life on earth accumulated enough good deeds such as charity, generosity, compassion, forgiveness, goodness, mercy, love for animals, respect for nature, gratitude, fairness, honesty, loyalty, then your Double will have all the opportunities and reasons to decide and select what shape, format, condition you will be in, and where you will continue to live.”"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":" In other words, you will have everything, absolutely everything and you can have any shape you want including a brand new corporal form.

To fully understand what Kikrama “Fikr-Rama” means, we must first comprehend what An- zalubirach is, and how it works. Anzalubirach is an Ana’kh/Ulemite term meaning the following: a-Collecting thoughts, receiving and sending multiple mental images via brain wave synchronization, to improve mental and physical health; b-Using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phases and practices of Tarkiz. Tarkiz means a deep mental or intellectual concentration that produces telekinesis and teleportation phenomena.

The brain is constantly producing different types of frequencies, waves, and vibrations, and transmitting messages reflecting our mental activity, feelings, thoughts, and state of consciousness or mind. Thus, the brain waves are divided in four states or categories called: 1-Beta, 2-Alpha,"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"3-Theta, 4-Delta. In addition to Betha, Alpha, Theta, and Delta waves, the Anunnaki Ulema developed a sixth wave called Fikr-Rama. It is neither measurable nor detectable, because it does not emanate from the physical brain. It is triggered by the Conduit situated in the brain’s cells. No science on Earth can direct us to the exact position of the Conduit. The Ulema said: 1- Through the mechanism of the Conduit, the enlightened ones regulate mind’s waves and frequencies. 2- The Fikr-Rama allows them to enter other dimensions, solid substances and matter. 3- The Fikr-Rama is a sort of a beam much lighter than laser.

Filfila is no exception. Perhaps the following excerpt from the Anunnaki-Ulema Kira’at- Dirassat, could elucidate the matter: “The meaning of the name of the great Perseus, founder of the Perseid Dynasty, and builder of the citadel of Mycenae is: “The Place of the Mushroom”, and various illustrations of the mushroom appeared abundantly on churches’ columns and inside the magical square of mediums and psychics. Another striking example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedek that appeared on a façade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding a chalice in the shape of a mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the Holy Grail, as interpreted in the literature of the Cathars, the Knights Templar,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"and many enlightened eastern secret societies. It was also interpreted as the “Divine-Human Vessel”, meaning the womb of Virgin Mary; the very womb that gave birth to Jesus. In ancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to the Anunnaki, the mushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of the female. More precisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of life and all living creatures. This fecundity source came in the form of a mitochondrial DNA. The secret extracted liquid of the mushroom represented the “Light Liquid” known also as Elixir of Life, often called in the ancient Middle East as the “Shiraab al Sahiriin” (Juice or Syrup of the sorcerers and lightworkers). Like the Zaafaran, the Shiraab was used by Sahiriin and Noble Lightworkers to write magical talismans, and the secret powerful names of the Supreme Beings on the Burqah, and inside the “Magical Square”."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"By using the invisible light liquid, only the spirit could read the Talabaat and the Istibabaat, and thus communicating with spirits, angels and entities was channeled through magical words and sentences invisible to the naked eyes.

These three words (Meaning a rose, or a flower) in ancient linguistic context, symbolized the blooming of life, and the flux of supernatural power. At one point in history, the mushroom’s figure was used by the Templiers de Saint Jean (Templar Order of St. John of Malta) as the symbol of the Holy Grail.

This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not end when pets die. II. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets? Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility of contacting deceased people or animals, they have explained to us that contacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, and only during the 40 days period following their death.

This happened some sixty years ago. Here is the story. My loving teacher asked the little Murad (Name of the novice): When did your dog die? Murad: This morning Master, please bring him back to me!

If you touch him, Poof, he will disappear. Note: By then, many students were alerted to what was going on and rushed to sit on the floor at the feet of the Master, excited and curious, they kept looking at the Master and I could hear them saying Master, please one more miracle, because they were accustomed to see the Master doing extraordinary things. An indescribable deep silence threw its heavy coat over the little students... and we were waiting... And all of a sudden, Murad screamed: Ahhhh...he is scratching my legs...he is licking my right foot...he is here...I feel him...Where is Master? Where is he, please tell me...I want to see him.

And suddenly the dust was transformed into a substance like fluffy white cotton, and finally the face of a small dog began to appear, and seconds later, his whole body became visible to all of us. Murad got so excited and so happy...and not remembering what the Master has told him, rushed to hug his dog. And this was a grave mistake. Because as soon as he touched the face of his dog, the dog vanished in thin air. What Murad did upset everybody, and we hated him for that! Obviously Murad is in state of shock now. He did not know what to do or what to say. He dropped on the ground, and almost fell in a coma. The dog never returned again. With an austere serenity, the Master was watching everything, and everybody. Then, almost in a perfect synchronization, the students shouted: Master! What happened? And very calmly, the Master said: “You never touch the body of the dead before he rises to a higher dimension.” None of us understood what he"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"meant. We kept on asking more and more questions, but the Master in a firm voice said: “The Dirasa did not start yet!” (Dirasa means the lesson or the study.) Two months later, the Master nicely surprised us with a lesson on Gensi-uzuru. Obviously, he did not forget how interested we were in learning more about what has happened to Murad’s dog. Everybody was excited beyond belief. And this is what the Master had to say: IV. Excerpts from Master Li’s Kira’at on Gensi- uzuru: The Anunnaki love their pets very much. They treat them with love and respect. They do not consider them animals, but friends who just look different. You too, all of you, should love and care for you pets. Your pets feel with you, and know if you love them or you don’t."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Your pets can even protect your health and some other time, I will tell you more about it. When your pets die, they don’t forget you. Like all of us, they remember their good friends. And believe me when I tell you, they will try to come back, because they want so much to be with you again. Unfortunately, this is not possible. However, and because of the great love you had for your pets, they will keep on trying and trying. Pets are like humans...after they die, they don’t understand what is happening to them. They become very confused. But this happens to your pets during two weeks only. The two weeks after they have died. After these two weeks, their essence is no longer trapped in the thin sphere separating Earth (More exactly, previous life) from the next dimension. So after two weeks, they are gone for good."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"For humans, it is 40 days. After 40 days, we are no longer here. We enter the next dimension, and we never come back. So, during these two weeks (Two weeks after they die), your pets can return to see you for a very very short moment. It could last up to 4 seconds. Now, it is up to you to feel their presence. It is not difficult if you pay attention. I am going to explain to you. First, what they do is this: Because they are no longer in a physical substance,(Physical form), and because they don’t know what is happening them, they approach you very slowly. They are confused, but they recognize you. They still remember where they were before. They remember your home, you, and the toys they played with; the ones you gave them. So, they come toward you slowly slowly, and gently will lean against your legs, or touch your legs like a whisper, like a child’s"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"caress. Unfortunately, very very very few people notice that. And sadly enough, your pets’ desperate efforts to contact you and let you know that they here around you are almost never felt. So, they dissipate, because they run out of energy. Remember, they can’t last for more than 4 seconds. But they don’t give up. They will try one more time. Only one more time. After that, they are gone for ever. Now listen to me carefully. While you are not aware of their invisible existence around you, things are still happening, and you can be part of it. You can still make some small arrangements, and mentally and emotionally prepare yourself to feel them when they return. And you will succeed. So what you have to do is this: Go fetch their toys. All of them if possible."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Put them in their favorite area, where they used to play with their toys or preferred to lay down. Sit on the floor around the toys. Remember, you can’t call your dead pets. You can’t communicate with them. But they will communicate with you and will return to see you for the last time. Bring their food and water bowls, and put them next to their toys, as if they were still alive. Don’t ask why, just do it. Stay there for sometime. Twenty minutes should suffice. You can leave the room, but it is imperative that every ten minutes you go back, and sit there for few more minutes. Keep on doing this for two days. Is it time consuming? Not really, if you want to see your pets again. And before you know it, they will come back, and they will rub against you, and you are going to feel it, and you will never ever forget that feeling.

I decided I had to build them more houses, give them decent living conditions. Luckily, there was a piece of land in the vicinity that did not belong to anyone. I went to look at it, make sure there was water around so we could dig a good well. I found plenty of water, decided it was the right place, and then, boom! Overnight, I built them ten houses.

The four individuals did not wish to be observed as they were building the houses.”  I sat there, watching him a bit suspiciously.

Rabbi Mordechai, he said, was an alchemist. It had little to do with building houses, but still, as an alchemist, he had powers. And then something else connected to it in my mind.

In Medieval Christianity, they symbolize the horns of the devil. If the sign is ascendant, then and only then, positive energy emanates from the star or the Anunnaki’s Delta.

He lived a long life, 1513-1609, and defended his people valiantly against their enemies. His followers loved him so much they called him \"The Exalted One.\" Even to a holy man, or a great mystic, creating life is forbidden. It can only be justified if many lives would be saved by doing so, and not always even then. But Rabbi Loeb was instructed to try the horrifying task.

His son-in- law, a Kohen (a Jew descended from the ancient order of priests) and his pupil, a Levite (a Jew descended from the servants of the Temple).

This happens quite often in the vast literature and history of ancient civilizations. Especially, when the inscriptions on or under the pictures or illustrations are written in a language we do not understand, such as Cuneiform, Ugaritic, Akkadian, Sumerian, Phoenician, and similar writing systems of the ancient Middle and Near East.
