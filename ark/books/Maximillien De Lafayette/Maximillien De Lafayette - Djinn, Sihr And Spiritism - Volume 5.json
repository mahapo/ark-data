Definition and introduction: A rectangular glass table, that resonates, when metallic cards are placed upon its surface."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The word “glass” is hereby used for lack of proper terminology. The material is transparent like glass, but the substance is very different, and cannot be described, using our Earth’s vocabularies. The “metallic cards” represent thin and encoded boards. The word “metallic” is hereby used, for lack of proper terminology. Each card contains sequences of numbers and dots, perforated on one side of each card. Misinformed researchers nicknamed the cards “Galactic Tarot”. It is incorrect. The cards project and interpret sequences and passages from an individual’s life in one particular dimension; one space-time sphere at the time. Duplicate, and/or multiple projections of different lives in different dimensions are"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"also possible. However, the projection of any of a person’s multiple lives existing in separate universes has no bearing or any effect on the current existence in the third dimension. Alteration of past events in a different dimension does not categorically alter current events in the third dimension. However, the results and direct consequences of such alteration could and would change the course of life, and events to occur in the present and the near future of an individual, if the person’s “Conduit” (Brain cell Conduit) is activated. On Earth, a person could be an illustrious writer, while in a second or a parallel dimension; the very same person is totally illiterate. People live different lives in different dimensions. On Earth, a person for instance is a distinguished judge, while in another dimension; the very same person is an outlaw."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Removing, altering and/or erasing a crime committed by a person in another dimension does not categorically “clean”, and/or delete the “Galactic Record” of that person on the “Conscience-Cosmic-Net”. That person is still held liable for his/her action, and will be punished for his/her crime. For instance, on Earth (Third dimension), you are 40 year old, while in the same time, you could be 60 year old, or not even born, in another dimension (Universe). In some dimensions, Alexander the Great is still on his way to ancient Persia, and Jesus is not yet crucified. The sequences constitute the code. The code is the key to a wide variety of information and data about individuals. In other words, each card could be interpreted as a microchip. The microchip stores every single event (Past, present and future) in the life of a person, including, duplications of similar or different occurrences on other planes."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"“Other planes” mean a separate form of existence in a parallel dimension. “Resonate” means responding to the placement of the card upon the surface of the glass table. “Responding” means, reading and/or deciphering the code (Key to information) of the data and information stored in each card. 2. Synopsis of mode of operation: La abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”, functions like “Miraya”, “Minzar”, and “Mnaizar”. However, the use of the La-abrida is limited to reading past, present, and future events in the life of one single person. When a card is placed on the top of the glass table, the card changes properties, shape and form. The “metallic” structural substance of the card becomes translucent, and merges with the glass surface. To the naked eye, it appears as if the card was totally absorbed by the glass surface."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"However, the size of the card remains intact. The shape of the card becomes circular, but retains its original size, meaning, each card occupies the same space, before the shape was changed. Thus, the form of the card becomes either circular or conical. Almost instantly, conic pages open up on the glass surface of the table. Usually, three to four pages, aligned horizontally. Each page has a distinct color, ranging from light green to almost transparent blue. Words, geometric symbols, dots, and numbers appear on each page. They are the data and information pertaining to the “existence” of one person in multiple spheres (Separate existences in multiple life-form universes.) This means, that individuals (Humans and animals alike) do live separately and independently as 4 distinct living persons in 4 distinct dimensions, or more. Contemporary quantum physics theorists"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"totally accept this reality. Many books and articles discussed this incomprehensible phenomenon. The multiple and separate existences (In our case, 4) are called in quantum physics membranes, or simply branes. Each membrane represents a separate world, called dimension in contemporary quantum physics. In other words, that dimension refers to “another universe”. So far, quantum physics theorists have accepted the notion that, there are 11 dimensions in our universe. On the glass surface of the La abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”, the adept will be able to see (In miniature) four different dimensions. Each one of them, containing a duplicate (Identical or totally different) of himself or herself, his or her total life, habitat, physical appearance, preoccupations, and environment. In other words, the adept is watching simultaneously his/her other four"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"existences/lives in four separate universes. And this concept has become a major part of the modern study and research of cosmology, and quantum physics, usually discussed under various theories, such as the “Multiverse”, the “M Theory”, the “String Theory”, the “Membranes Theory,” so on. 3. The beginning of everything: Multiple existences and “God’s Particle”. Ulema Haroon Bakri bin Rached Al Ansari, and Ulema Mordechai ben Zvi provided the following explanation. Herewith reproduced verbatim, word for word, and unedited. Taken from their Kira’at (Readings), Kiramat Ketab (Book of the good deeds), Hadith (Speech; dialogue) and Rou’ya (Visions; insight): Time is not linear. Thus, the landscape of so called time and space is not the same in other worlds. In multiple universes, the past, the present, and the future are all contained in one particle."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"This particle is the “Cell of Everything”. This means, everything that has existed before, and shall exist afterward. It is the origin of the creation. The particle is the beginning of everything that is everlasting. Quantum physics theorists call this cell or particle the “God’s Particle”. In this cell, you will find all the “Bubbles” (Term used by modern cosmologists) that collided together to create all the universes, galaxies, and planets in the cosmos. Who created the God’s Particle? Who created the universe? Who created time? Who created “God”? Is there one single Creator who created everything in the universe, including humans and non-humans? The God’s particle was at the beginning of everything. And everything was not in existence. Thus, before the particle, time did not exist, space did not exist, the past did not"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"exist, the future did not exist, humans did not exist, and religions did not exist; in brief nothing existed. The Universe was not created by one single creator. The universe was not created by a “Big Bang.” The universe emerged from itself, from within. And when, the nothingness of existence of all forms and substances suddenly collided with itself, the whole universe exploded into billions and billions of stars, galaxies, planets, and layers of dimensions. In some universes, the coagulation of time with the landscape of space created time. When time was created by the collision of universes (Bubbles), galaxies and universes took shape and place in the cosmos. On some planets, and in some galaxies, photosynthesis, metabolism, followed by micro-biological evolution created multiple life-forms everywhere. Some of these life-forms produced all kinds"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"and shapes of organic and botanic substances, stones, mountains, gases, waters, atmospheres. In some dimensions, different intelligent life forms were created. We call this intelligent life-form “Kir-Ra- Ibra”, meaning the faculty of reasoning and creating. The primordial intelligent life-form belonged to very advanced galactic races inhabiting billions of stars and planets. Billions of years later, the human race was genetically created by some of these very advanced intelligent life-forms, such as the Anunnaki, Igigi, and Lyrans. When pre-humans, proto-humans, and quasi- human began to populate the Earth, time did not exist at that point in history. Later, much later, when the Lyrans, Igigi, and the Anunnaki commenced to experiment with the archaic human species (They were 47 different categories), they installed in the brain of the human beings, some form of intelligence."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Some early humans were fortunate to receive the “Conduit”, the invisible cell in the brain that produces all sorts of human activities and thoughts. When the early human beings began to reason, the notion of time was conceived. Thus, “Time” became the invention of humans. Time exists on Earth, not on other dimensions. La-abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu”: Is it a tool to go back in time or jump into the future? Is it physical or ethereal? The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin explain: No. Because, if you want to go back in time, and/or visit the future, you have to depart from this dimension (Earth), where you currently live. Once, you are outside the perimeter of the third dimension (Earth), time bends on itself. Space bends on itself."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"And you are caught in the middle. However, you can escape this dilemma, and realign yourself, following the cadence/rhythm of all dimensions beyond the third one. How, will you accomplish this? We will elaborate on this, when we study the “Parallel Synchronization.” Since time does not exist, the enlightened ones (Many of you are enlightened) will be able to watch themselves living separately in different worlds. This is what La abrida “Bzi’ra-irdu” does. It allows you to “see” not to revisit the past or jump into the future, unless your “Conduit” is fully activated. Once you are outside the physical realm (Earth), you immediately connect with the beginning of everything in the universe. You become part of “God’s Particle.” However, and as we have explained before, revisiting the so-called past is possible if you use the Gomatirach Minzari."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"But bear in mind, you are not visiting, but transposing yourself, unless your “Conduit” is fully activated. 5. Can I use the “La-abrida” to ameliorate my life, and change my destiny? “Yes,” said Ulema Kanazawa. He added, verbatim: “However, you cannot alter the laws of cause and effect; something similar to what you call Karma, but in reality, it is quite different from Karma, because there is no place for reincarnation in the world of the Anunnaki. There are Anunnaki’s norms that remain universal wherever you go, although they are norms per se, but not necessary cosmic laws. On Earth, you are accountable for all your actions. The same applies in all the dimensions, realms, and spheres of time, and space. However, in a different form of existence, or dimension, the nature and understanding of certain moral and ethical laws might change considerably."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Such change has a paramount effect on the level of enlightenment and happiness you wish to reach. On Earth, we have what we call the human law, the natural law, and dogma establishing acceptable behavior in societies and communities. These laws quite often change in virtue of our understanding of what is right, and what is wrong. They also change, as time changes, as our form of government changes, as a majority’s power and influence change, regionally and nationally. Nothing is truthfully permanent on Earth. In the galactic perimeter of advanced and “spiritual” communities, values do not change. They are permanent and universal, and they govern the general conduct of life- forms and intelligent entities, in the entire universe. If you enter a particular dimension, far away from Earth, or too close to Earth, you might encounter social rules that are in sharp"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"contrast with laws on Earth. This could confuse your mind, and prevent you from understanding and/or recognizing what is right, and what is wrong. If this should happen to you, you will not be able to ameliorate your life, and change your destiny, when you return to Earth, and/or to the present. Something else you should take into consideration. What kind of destiny, success, happiness, prosperity and advancement are you talking about? Are they those your are aiming at, upon returning to Earth, or those you are seeking after death? Or, possibly those that exist in a dimension close to Earth? The Anunnaki-Ulema can simultaneously live in two or three different dimensions, and coordinate their actions via the “Conduit”. We call this, the “Universal Conduit”. Humans have not yet reached a level of"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"morality and “spirituality” that allows them to live and relive in separate dimensions at the same time. Although, some humans might be invited to visit another dimension and acquire a great deal of knowledge, wisdom, and even supernatural powers, upon their return to Earth, they will instantly forget whatever they have learned, heard and seen, unless they are spiritually developed, and guided by the enlightened ones. Thus, in order to ameliorate you destiny, prosper in your endeavors, and preserve a good health, you must be able to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, at a galactic level. You must become acquainted with the universal truth; the galactic harmony of things. Truth in the “outer cosmos” is quite different from the truth you find on Earth. Only your activated “Conduit” will allow you to do so."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"There also certain measures and requirements you must consider and comply with, before you leave Earth and enter another dimension, and/or time-space sphere. For instance, selecting the correct time to revisit the past, and/or another dimension is paramount. What “Ba’ab” (Door or entrance to the other world) shall you enter? How shall you adapt, correct or adjust your vision in a new dimension? How would you differentiate between an astral travel, imagination, fantasy of your mind, and reality? Even in highly developed dimensions, and in many different time/space spheres, you will encounter fantasy, tricks of the mind, hallucinations, and fake apparitions. Many of the other dimensions (Plans) and time-space spheres are similar to Earth, even though the structural composition and their properties are enormously different."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"All these encounters, images and feelings will prevent your mind from understanding what you are seeing. You will be totally confused. For example, and let’s assume for now, that you have managed to go back in time, and visit with people and societies from the 18 th century. First, how would you know, that the people you will see there are indeed from the 18 th century, and not people just like you, visiting the past for the first time? Second, how would you guide yourself, direct yourself, and reach your destination, without getting lost? Bear in mind, that in a different dimension, you will not have enough time to find your way around, if you don’t have the map of the afterlife, and parallel dimensions. Third, you will not be able to last long over there, because your mind and your body will run out of energy. Besides, do you know how to charge and/or"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"recharge yourself? You will be facing incomprehensible situations similar to ectoplasmic apparitions. Quite often, these ectoplasmic apparitions and/or projections (Complete or partial) dissipate because the entity has rapidly consumed its “apparition and manifestation energy.” Once you have completed your orientation program, and the master has activated your “Conduit”, your trip to the past or to another dimension will be successful and very beneficial. 6. Revisiting your childhood in another dimension, in another time: Master Kanazawa explained this in one of his Kira’at (Readings). Here is what he said to his students, verbatim, word for word, and unedited: Copy of your childhood is still real and vivid in another dimension."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"This image is still there. It is your image when you were a child. It is physical and real. Even the toys and candies you loved are still there, and they are real too. You can even touch those toys and play with them if you want. You can grab your favorite candies from the jar and eat one. Everything you see and taste is real. You are not hallucinating, and your mind is not playing tricks on you. How can you be so sure? It is simple, and very convincing, because upon meeting people you knew while you were child, you will be able to tell them how did they live and what they did when they were young like you, in the same town, around the same corner, and even describe to them the kind of games you played with them in the streets, in the school yard, and on the streets sidewalks. You will be able to tell them what they did"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"on that particular Sunday day, after the church service. But you will see it and enjoy it only once, because you might not be able to return once again to that dimension. Sometime, it is so easy to enter the extra- dimension of your youth, without training. Sometime, it happens, just like that, because you have escaped the gravity of time on Earth. It is a sudden opening into your past. A past you have lived here on Earth, and was duplicated somewhere else. Now, you are revising that “somewhere else”, and nobody is going to recognize it, except you. You will recognize all the people you will be seeing and meeting in that “somewhere elsewhere” dimension. But, they will not recognize you. Even though, you give them very particular and personal details about their lives, their habits, the place where they grew up, the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"name of that school teacher they like, of that math teacher they hated. Still, they will not believe that you are the one you claim or pretend to be; a friend from their youth, a real friend from your past, or their past; a past you really shared with them. But remember, there is always one person who will believe you. And he is always around you. Perhaps, it is the other copy of yourself, or your guardian angel? You will have the chance to meet that “other copy of yourself” in some other time, and somewhere else...in another dimension. The name of the store you are revisiting now in that dimension has not changed. Perhaps, only the name of the proprietor did. Because the former owner was already too old, and he passed away some twenty years ago. You used to come to that store, sit on the stool, and talk to Mr. Ted, the old owner of"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"the store. “Mr. Ted passed away long time ago,” will tell you the man standing behind the counter in the store. But the truth is, Mr. Ted is somewhere else now, exactly as you are somewhere else, in other dimension. Something very strange will happen to you in that dimension. You could see yourself as a child riding that beautiful old carousel. Or perhaps chasing an old car. Those images are real. Because you will recognize them in their most intimate details. Some other people will agree with you when you describe to them the carousel you loved, the kind of cars people drove in that small town, and the name of those teachers you have mentioned. Yet, they will never believe you when you tell them, that you grew up here, how you used to chase that old Impala Chevrolet of Mr. Evans, and those treasured comics books you bought from Mrs. Adams, who"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"used to own the little bookstore around the corner. It is up to you to believe what you are seeing or to totally reject it. But if you reject it, you will never be able to revisit your youth, and other worlds, small towns, and cities you lived in before. You begin to ask yourself, how did you get there? How did you get here in the other dimension? You start to question your sanity. But you know deep down, you are not dreaming, and you are not hallucinating, because the people you see are real, and they walk and they talk like real people. Only their hairdo has changed, the fashion of their clothes is old, old enough to send you back in time. The cars you see are old too, they are 1930’s model. And the calligraphy style of the names of the shops on windows and doors is old too. So what are you going to do in that strange"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"place? You put your hands in your pockets, and you will find dimes and nickels. Because that was all what you needed to buy an ice cream or a candy. Then you begin to wonder why people do not believe you. You have told them true stories about people they knew, stories about you and your parents, and about everything you saw and you did when you were a child in that town. It is very likely, you will meet your parents before they were married. You will recognize your mother, or at least your mother to be. You call her by her name, her maiden name and her married name. You will scare her, and she will think you are insane. How would you or could you convince her you are her child? How would you convince her that she was the mother who fed you, who clothed you and took you to the movie house “Rex” with"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"your sisters, and kept on telling you to keep quiet while watching the movie, because you talked too much. You tell her all this, yet, she will not believe you. But just before you leave her, she feels something she can’t explain. These encounters and deja vu experiences happened to many people before. If you anchor them in your mind, in your “Conduit”, you will be able to return and visit with them once again, but it will happen in a different dimension. A dimension, where your mother is no longer your mother, but possibly your date, or just another woman? Confusing? You bet. But this is what constitutes the fabric of time and space in other dimensions. A time and a space that cease to exist in that dimension. A dimension not very far from where you currently live. "},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"7. The invisible quantum line dividing two space- time dimensions: The Honorable Anunnaki-Ulema Master said: The invisible thin quantum line dividing two times capsules, both located on the same plane, is usually the outer limit of two dimensions. These two time-space dimensions are usually found in isolated areas, such as distant valleys, fields, and spots on Earth, rarely visited by the public. The two time-capsules represent two different time intervals and all past events that occurred separately in each one of them. Even sounds from past eras can be heard separately, coming from each one of them. You can’t see the diving line. It is not visible to the naked eye. If you cross that line, you leave the time you are living in, and you enter a different time- space. This is the time and space where you can change the past, but rarely does it happen,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"unless in previous times, you were part of the past, and/or have witnessed these events from the past. For instance, you are in 1974, on one time- capsule section of the land (Field, desert, spot). You cross the line separating 1974 and another year, perhaps hundreds of years. You cross the line and you enter another time without knowing it. Once in, you become part of the past, and a real person from the past. You are as real as all the physical things you see before your eyes. The events or scenes you will see are usually memorable, meaningful, historical, or important events known to you. You are very familiar with what you are currently seeing. They appear from nowhere, and since you have become part of the past, these events become factual. Part of your mind will tell you that you know"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"a lot about these events, because you have read about these events, but you can’t remember where and when. Another part of your mind convinces you that you are seeing the true events as they have happened, or you are seeing the events for the first time. This is a moment of confusion for you. But eventually you will sort it out. Is it a mirage? A hallucination? A fantasy? Or the real thing? Well, if you have stepped in the true time-capsule sphere, then, what you are seeing is real, and what you are feeling is not psychosomatic but truly physical. Many people have reported that some of their friends have vanished walking this dividing line. And the missing persons were never found, because they have entered another dimension, never to return again. In the Anunnaki’s “Donia” (Spheres; world), there is no hallucination, coincidence, fantasy, or psychosomatic effects. Everything"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"is tested and real. If for some reasons, the “Ba’ab” (Door; stargate) of time-space opens up before you, and you were instantly transported or absorbed into its dimension, you instantly become an inseparable part of that dimension. You will relive the events and time of that dimension. If at the time, when you were transported, a battle was going on, you become one of those men who are fighting in this battle. Each scene that appears before your eyes will blend you in its fabric and time-reality, and you will not be able to escape its boundaries. How real are these events? They are real 100%. Are you really seeing a real battle? Affirmative. What if for some reasons you took part in this battle, is there a possibility that you could get killed? Really killed? Absolutely."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Because in that dimension, you are not a spectator, or a visitor, but a real person transposed and transported to a real battle field. It is hard, even impossible for humans to understand this mystery. But it is happening for real in another dimension. Yes, you could die in that dimension, but you are still alive in another one, because all of us live simultaneously in different dimensions. Probably now you are asking whether the person who died in that battle is in fact the same person who is still alive in 1978 or 1979 or even in the future. And my answer is yes. You are all these persons in all these capsule-time spheres. You are the same person, but the properties of your body are different, as dictated by each dimension respectively. Another time-scene might open before you, for example, an old city market or bazaar. The shoppers, the stores, the goods, and"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"everything you see is real. You look at yourself and you realize that you are wearing clothes of the era. Yet, part of your mind that has retained space-time memory will tell you that you are living real events and real time, but you are just visiting another time and space in history. Then, if this is the scenario, can you go back to where you came from? Yes, you can. One way to do it is by using the Gomatirach- minzari, and similar techniques. (Note: See Gomatirach-minzari, on page 83 in the book “Ramadosh Book; 13 Anunnaki-Ulema Mind Power Techniques to Live Longer, Happier, Healthier, Wealthier.) 8: Q&A: At the end of Master Kanazawa’ Kira’at (Reading/Lecture), a young student asked the Master: “Master, it is possible to bring with me, something from that dimension I have visited, so when I tell my friends about it they would believe me?” “Of course you can,” replied the Master. “And this"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"is how many ancient artifacts were brought back to the present. Some ended in the basements of museums, others dissipated in the doubtful minds of humans who could live only once.” Another young student asked Honorable Master Kanazawa: “Master, you told us that sometimes, we enter a different dimension without knowing how to do it. You said, it happens just like that. Why? And if this happens just like that, then our “Conduit” does not need to be activated to visit other worlds?” The perplexed student paused for a short moment, and asked again: “Master, when we get there, do we go to different levels in the same dimension, or is it one single dimension we see all the time? And how many different worlds can we visit in a single trip to the past or to other dimensions?” The Honorable Master replied (As is, verbatim, word for word, and unedited): Everything depends on how your brain is wired. If your “Conduit” has been activated, then,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"you will know and understand what is happening to you, and all the things you will see in the other world(s) will be assimilated gradually by your brain. To understand what it is actually happening there, and how you got there, you have to visualize your mind as a tall building with many floors. Inside the building, there is an elevator that goes all the way to the highest floor. There is only one single elevator for all the people who enter the building. Each floor represents one layer of that dimension (The other world). This does not mean that the dimension you have entered has sub-divisions or additional dimensions. Simply put, the dimension is divided into multiple spheres, called layers. Each sphere gathers different kinds of people, eras, knowledge, events, memories, sensations, cars, shops, streets, so on. One floor could be the past universe and past time of the 18 th century. Another floor"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"could be the 12 th century. And another floor could be the future. But for now, do not worry about all these centuries and the future. Instead, let’s go back to the place on Earth, from which you entered another dimension. There are two kinds of entrances to another world. The first one occurs through the activation of your “Conduit”. And you know already how this happens. The second kind of entrance to another world is the accidental one, which is the current situation you are in. Usually, the coincidental or accidental entrance to another world occurs from spots and areas on Earth, that are not heavily visited or frequented. So, let’s assume that you are in a distant field, a valley, a prairie, whatever. And you are just walking in that field. For reasons, your mind cannot understand yet, time-space pockets open up before you."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Some scientists call these pockets vortices. In our Ana’kh language, we call them “Ba’abs” (Doors, entrances, time tunnels, etc.) When the “Ba’ab” accidentally opens up, a huge but narrow tunnel appears before you. This tunnel takes the form of a spiral-wind; a sort of an atmospheric turbulence. You will see it. You will feel its electro-magnetic field, and before you know it, you are sucked up by its current. Once inside the tunnel, your will start to feel as if your body is shrinking. Sometime, just the opposite. You will feel as if your body is stretching out intensely. Everything depends on the intensity of the tunnel’s vacuum power. In all cases, you will be transported immediately, to another dimension that resembles the building I told you about before. The vacuum power, the tunnel’s magnetic"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"field, and the opening of the “Ba’ab”, all these phenomena are caused by atmospheric anomalies conditioned and created by the collision of time-space plates. For now, consider these time-space plates as the tectonic plates of the Earth, that have caused the Earth to shift so many times throughout the centuries, and to change the superficies, shapes, and locations of continents, oceans, mountains, so on. The time-space plates, although invisible to the naked eye, exist at the entrance and borders of all dimensions existing in the universe. You can consider them as the landmark(s) of multiple universes. When the plates collide, or bump into each other, a time/space-vacuum tunnel opens up immediately. In this very particular time/space-vacuum tunnel, all things, physical and non-physical lose their original and primordial properties."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This means, that your body entering this vacuum is no longer the same body you had on Earth. The molecules change. Your Nahpsiya (DNA in modern scientific language) is altered. The weight and size of your body change instantly. In brief, what you retain in you, is only a spatial memory, a sort of a small recollection of things and events that happened to you on Earth. Now, you are inside the tunnel. Your body zooms inside the tunnel at the speed of light. This incomprehensible speed allows you to travel to the edge of the universe. And this travel includes all the dimensions and other worlds that have existed and/or shall exist in the future. You might land in a world that has existed in the past. Once you land there, you will not be able to understand everything you see."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"But you will realize very clearly, that you are now in a different and a real world. Now, we go back to the tall building I told you about before. It is very important to remember that building, because we are going to use it as a representation of the other world you are facing now. Very good. Now you are right in front of the tall building. If you stay in the street, outside the building, you will see only one dimension. This dimension could be Egypt in the 3 rd century B.C., or Paris in the 18 th century. It does not matter. Now, you decide to enter the building. You go straight to the elevator and you push the second floor button. Very good. The door of the elevator opens up, you step out, and you enter the second floor.

What are you going to see on the 1oth floor? Certainly, neither Egypt or Paris, or anything else you saw on other floors. It is going to be another country.

The most common one is the Gregorian Calendar, which is a reflection of the Christian faith. It is younger than the Muslim calendar, which in turn, is younger than the Jewish calendar. All of these are considerably younger than the Anunnaki calendar, which is the only one used by the Anunnaki-Ulema. The Anunnaki-Ulema and Rouhaniyiin reject the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"idea that the week consists of seven days. Their week consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of our week. These are the only days to use in this technique, and the other three days in our week should not be calculated upon. The Ulema-Anunnaki and Mounawariin’s days are: Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday) Day 2: Araba (Wednesday) Day 3: Jema (Friday) Day 4: Saba (Saturday). The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and the hours in each day. Using the calendar of the Anunnaki-Ulema, each person can find the luckiest hour of his or her week, according to the Book of Ramadosh (Rama- Dosh). Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week is not sufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at work if it occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday. This predicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique, Time"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Manipulation, on that exact hour. The time that will be added to your life under such circumstances will be as lucky as the original hour, and your chances of success will be vastly improved.” The Rouhaniyiin and Mounawariin teachers highly recommend performing a combination of techniques, since each enhances the other considerably. The calendars’ grids: A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, are all people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour? Yes, indeed they would. There are only sixteen grid lines to represent millions of people each. And this leads to an interesting discovery. The numbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony that exists between them. For example, if you wish to approach someone in high places for a favor, finding that he or she shares the number of letters and the lucky hour will enhance your chances. Always send your request to him or her during the"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"lucky hour, either by calling on the phone, using your e-mail, or placing a written letter in the mailbox. The use of a language: Another question is the issue of languages. What if your name is written with four letters in America, where you live, but with five letters in your native language? The answer is simple. Always use your native language, the language that you were first aware of your name in, in your grid. It will be much more accurate and certainly more powerful. An important fact to add is that this technique is simple, but it can be enhanced in many ways by subtle variations. Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space is related to luck and success, and how to fine tune the process. But even in this straightforward version, the technique is incredibly powerful, so much so that it may change your life completely, always for the better."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":" Tip: If any added numbers are higher than one digit, always add the numbers and use the result.

Wasila: Term referring to uninvited bad spirits. Spirits are found everywhere. Some live in confined areas, others, right here, on Earth, around us, wherever we go, and lots of them follow us. Allamah Sadek bin Jaafar Al Kouraychi said, “Hawa lil Al Arwaah, Arwaah al Hawa”, meaning, “Air for the spirits, the spirits of the air.” He meant that the air we breathe, the atmosphere we live in are full of spirits and entities. The unseen world is their habitat, and it is an immense world full with spirits and entities. Some entities want to enter the world of the living and create a rapport with us. They have their own agenda. One way to do it is to invade our zone, the space defined by the Khateyn Tarika. This zone is their gateway and passage to our bodies and mental faculties. As soon as our mind is weakened for a variety of reasons, particularly financial and emotional reasons, the Khateyn Tarika weaken considerably, and our Double becomes agitated."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"If the situation worsens, the two lines of the Khateyn Tarika begin to distance themselves from our physical body. And when these two lines cross over the distance of 6 feet, which is normally our safe zone, the Double is instantly displaced, and pushed out of the two lines. This is a very dangerous situation, because we have lost the Double as a guardian, and we have lost the two lines as our protective shield. This is the moment bad spirits would invade our zone. And the door becomes wide open to a fleet of uninvited bad spirits. They enter one after another, unchallenged and head towards our bodies. You can call this possession. Once inside our bodies, our brain (Mind) is instantly perturbed, and the possessed individuals begin to lose their reasoning and mental stability. Some entities will anchor themselves deep within our physical body, and the very fabric of our psyche and emotions. This unquestionably would create mental illness."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Possessed people begin to hear voices, and act under the influence of these voices. Some entities move in and outside of our bodies at will. A few of them would manifest in the flesh right in front of us, and this manifestation is terrifying. Quite often when a possessed person tells us stories about these apparitions, we rush to say “You are seeing things”. Well yes! He/she is seeing things. These things are the very disturbing manifestations of the entities. Financial worries, fear, constant failures, addiction to drugs, and emotional suffering disrupt the peace in our body’s zone. They register on the 2 lines of Khateyn Tarika. The healthy colors of the two lines begin to deteriorate, to weaken, and finally they distance themselves from our bodies. When the two lines are no longer close to our body, our Double is immediately kicked out from our zone. The bad entities see this. They even smell our emotional problems and fear.

And here we have two scenarios: Scenario one pertains to a case when we have summoned an entity not knowing that this entity is from the lower level. Entities from the lower dimensions move in groups. They are never alone. They jointly prey on people. As soon as one of them invades our weakened zone, all the other entities follow. The Bible, several religious scriptures, the Prophet Mohammad, and even Jesus Christ talked about a bunch of bad entities who simultaneously and jointly entered human bodies, and refused to leave. So, as you see, one bad entity always brings along several other entities.

Answer : The Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin have lots of powerful commands to dispose of the bad entities. You will find plenty of commands to repel and/or send away Afarit, and bad entities in volume one and volume two of this series. The Taaleb must memorize these commands. Some commands deal specifically with this or that entity. This is a very difficult and threatening situation. You can’t tell the bad entities “Hey buddy wait a minute, let me find the command in the book, so I can command and kick your ass out!!” This would be a big mistake. This is why I have insisted that beginners and adepts should and must know all these commands by heart. You will have no time at all to regain control of the situation, while making the entities wait, until you find the proper command. It would be too late. And as soon as one bad entity squeezes in, expect to see more malevolent spirits doing the same. Usuallu, such intrusion is accompanied by a horrible sulphuric odor."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"This is how we sense their presence when they do not manifest in the flesh. Ironically, the malevolent spirits enjoy this intoxicating smell. In fact, it is through this sulphuric odor that they follow each other. Of course, they do not need to smell each other to recognize each other, since they come from the same Kirba, meaning habitat. But the odor of one “squeezed in” Afrit or bad entity, is an open invitation to other entities to invade our weakened zone and possess our body. The awfully bad odor marks their territory. In this particular case, the territory is our weakened zone.

Gensi-uzuruis is associated with apparition of dead pets, and our communication with them during a very specific time period. The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin are very fond of animals. Extensive passages in the Book of Rama- Dosh speak about the important role animals play in the life of humans, especially at emotional and therapeutic levels. The Ulema believe that pets understand very well their human-friends (Instead of using the word “owners”). And also, pets communicate with those who show them love and affection. This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not end when pets die. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets? Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility of contacting deceased people or animals ad infinitum, they have explained to us that contacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, and only during the 40 days period following their death."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"In other words, we can contact our pets, deceased parents and dear ones, or more accurately enter in contact with them if: a-They contact us short after their death; b-They must initiate the contact; c-This should happen during a 40 days period following their departure; d-Their contact (Physical or non-physical) must be noticed by us. This means that we should and must pay an extra attention to “something” quite irregular or unusual happening around us. Because our departed pets will try to send us messages, and in many instances, they do. e-We must expect their messages, and strongly believe in those messages.

Zoohoor and Baa rada hiwan: Baa rada means the company of, or being in the presence of. Hiwan means animals, more precisely domesticated animals; pets, such as dogs and cats. In the Sahiriin’s literature and esoteric practices, cats play a major role; a role that rotates around prediction of events to occur within a short period of time, and sensing danger. Cats are also considered a “Psychic Conduit” by Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. In fact, in some of their black magic Jalasaat (Séances), Sahiriin would bring in a cat to help sense, receive and send messages and predictions. The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions or"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Predictions of the Cat) was very active in ancient Egypt and the Near East. On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin strongly recommend to adopt cats, and care for them, for they could be very useful to their owners; they are capable of sensing imminent dangers, catastrophes, mishaps, and above all, their instinctive nature leads them to warn their owners, little children, and people who love them against danger. Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A cat in the house is blessing.” Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if they bother to watch, study and understand their behavior. Quite often, cats stare at something the human eye can’t see. And in some instance, and for a few seconds, cats remain frozen in their attention upon looking at the unknown which seems to appear to them in etheric forms. The Sahiriin told us that these etheric forms could be spirits, the souls of dead people who are interested in the occupants of the house, dead little"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"girls and boys who can’t realize that they are dead now, and keep on playing with their toys and running right and left in particular parts of the house they used to live in; in our case, the current house of the cat who is staring at them. The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attention to the observing cat, to remain calm and patient, and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat is staring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat, and to take notes of the reaction of the cat. This exercise of ours should not stop there. We should keep on observing our cat, and taking notes, and above all to draw a map of the places in our home which seem to interest the cat and/or provoke the cat to sense the unseen; a map which could include more than one place in our home and locate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a web of openings, a sort of time-space vortices, or simply a “playground” for spirits. How do pet psychics communicate with animals? Jennifer Wallens, the world’s #1 pet psychic and animal communicator said, “I can say that I mostly use telepathy to communicate with the animals and"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"to tap into their world. Telepathy is the sending and receiving of information by way of words, feelings and images. I also use my ability to tune in psychically and hear words sometimes transmitted, as well as feel their emotions and pick up colors, medical conditions, and other issues. I do look at them physically and pick up on the body language as well. So for me it is a combination of using every ability and tool I have. Animals will sometimes first flash an image to me, and allow me to tune in to them and feel where their pain is, or what problem they are having, or if there is something they want, and they will show that item or activity as an image.” She added, “A funny example the other night happened when my little 10 year old toy poodle Tinkerbell, sat up in the bed looked straight at me after we got into bed, staring deeply at me, I looked at her, cleared my mind, and immediately saw a vanilla wafer in an image!

Well, needless to say I went back to the kitchen and brought back the special requested treat, much to their delight. It truly amazes me how incredibly intelligent they are and they are just waiting for us to catch up and realize they are communicating all the time, in their own way. I have developed my own technique which I may adjust according to the animal I am working with or whether I am with them in person. If I am there with the animal, I look at their reactions, and I always first lay a hand on them to comfort them and look into their eyes with out saying anything. I smile and send out loving energy to them and then ask telepathically what they would like to convey to me that I may tell their owner/family. If there is a problem I am aware of, I focus on the awareness of this issue and the solution to the problem, not just the problem. It is important to view everything from the same perspective of the animal to truly"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"understand them. I wait for an image, feeling, emotion, or clairaudiently, words or phrases to begin the telepathic exchange. If I am not able to meet directly with the animal, then I can do this with photos of the animal and communication with their owner over the phone or SKYPE. It does not seem to make a difference in outcomes or results, as it seems I receive the same relevant helpful information in one way or another. I believe my guides are always helping me to connect with the animals. It doesn't hurt to call on St. Francis of Asissi for assistance as well. Asking Jennifer Wallens believes all animals have a soul, a spirit that as I have been told remains with us even into the afterlife. This \"soul\" is like our own, it retains its personality after death. I do believe in reincarnation and that this soul will come back again in another animal form.
