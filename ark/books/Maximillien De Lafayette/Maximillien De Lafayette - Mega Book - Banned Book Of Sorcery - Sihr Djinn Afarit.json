I haven’t seen yet agenuine Sihr’s practitioner in the United States, nor heard of one.In Europe, I met with five individuals from Morocco, Libya, Adan andAlgeria who practiced some form of Sihr, and who have learned certaintechniques and a few “tricks” from traditional Sihr’s practitioners backhome.However, in the Middle East and the Near East, I met plenty.Some practitioners were extraordinary, but were rare. Out of 27practitioners I talked to, and witnessed their “magic-sorcery” work, only 5made my head spin. Per contra, zillions of people in the West claim to bewitches and magicians practicing Wicca and/or similar arts and disciplines.I did meet a few of them on several occasions, and discussed their work atlength; out of 46 Wicca’s practitioners I met in Europe and the United States,only 2 revealed certain talent or a “gift” to a certain degree.The only practitioner who was able to demonstrate and produce captivatingresults was psychic-medium-witch Patti Negri in Los Angeles, California. 5-The two sides or partners of Sihr:The world of Sihr consists of two partners:a-People like you and me who are interested in the occult.b-Invisible entities from a physical world and a non-physical world (OrDimensions) we refer to as:AfaritDjinnsGhoolShayatiinGalas, so on. 6-Protocol and Etiquette:Yes! Sihr has its own protocol, and summoning entities must meet certainrules, norms and a delicate etiquette known as the Ousoul and the Nizam. 7-Language (s):32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Afarit, Djinns, Arwaah, Ghools, and other entities have their ownlanguages, which I have outlined in this book. It is easy to learn some ofthose languages.To establish a successful rapport with them, you must talk to them in theirown language(s).This does not mean that you can’t communicate with the Spirit world, sincean infinite part of it is inhabited by our departed loved ones, siblings,friends, and people who speak our own languages and/or foreign languageswe know. 8-Sihr’s domain and subjects:Ad infinitum. Unlimited. Unrestricted. Limitless.This book sheds lights on its topics and subjects. Sihr deals with all sorts ofsituations, cases and conditions that shape and regulate our daily life, fromlove to hate, from success to failure, from wealth to poverty, and from youto me and vice versa. 9-Are Afarit and Djinns friendly or hostile?Is it safe to summon them?Some are extremely friendly and supportive.Others are hostile and dangerous.You will be safe if you follow the Ousoul and Nizam of Afarit and Djinns. 10-Is it easy to learn and practice Sihr?Easier than you think.

And the Djinns did He create from a smokeless flame offire.”Ibliis (Iblis) is the most noted Djinn in Islamic and Arabic mythology.

Islamic scholar Ibn Abbas said, “Two thousand years before man wascreated, Djinns and Afarit lived on Earth...”According to the Anunnaki Ulema, Djinns, Afarit and humans were createdat the same time for similar purposes to a certain degree.The Koran told us that, short after they were created, the Djinns and Afaritbecame troublemakers, and began to commit atrocious crimes, so Allahdecided to punish them, so he sent his angels-army to capture them and exilethem to remote islands in the sea.According to the Babylonian cuneiform clay tablets, after their creation,humans became very noisy and start to disturb the sleep of the gods andgoddesses (Anunnaki), so the Anunnaki decided to get rid of them(Annihilate them) by sending the great flood.37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":" Djinns and Afarit as depicted in an ancient Persian manuscript. ________________________________Nature and form:According to Islam, Djinns and Afarit are made/created from smokeless fireor flames.Citations from the Koran:Surat Al-Hijr, 27: “We created the Djinn before out of the fire of a searingwind.”Surat Al-Hijr 15:27: “And the Jinn, We created aforetime from thesmokeless flame of fire.”Al-Rahmaan 55:15, 15: “He created man from sounding clay like the clay ofpottery.

The Koran and Islamic scholarstold us that the Djinns and Afarit shapeshift at will.They have the capability and power of appearing to us in a human form, andin an animal form, such as snakes, black dogs, dragons and monsters. Thisbelief is shared by the Allamah and Anunnaki Ulema. Like us, Djinns andAfarit have families, spouses, and children. And they share with us many ofour feelings and sensations such as hate, revenge, affection, love andcommitment to their families and social groups. And like us, they grow up,and die. Categories/Classes/Types:According to Islamic and pre-Islamic mythologies, there are three distinctcategories of Djinns:1-Category one: Air-Creatures which fly at an enormous speed.2-Category two: Black dogs and snakes.3-Category three: Traveling-Spirits (Traveler-Spirits) who reside in aconfined area.According to the Anunnaki Ulema there is only one type of Djinns-Afaritwho inhabit places known to human, as well as in invisible dimensions.(Note: See Habitat).39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" Djinns and Afrit in their habitat as depicted in an ancient Islamic manuscript.___________________________Character:According to Islam, there are good Afarit and Djinns who are extremelybenevolent, and groups of Djinns and Afarit who are bad, and extremelydestructive. Both categories possess mind-bending supernatural powerswhich can be solicited by humans to accomplish extraordinary deeds. Favors, protection, and loyalty:Ironically, in many instances, Djinns and Afarit refuse to grant the Taalebiin(Plural of Taaleb) any favor, when the Talabaat (Requests, Demands,Incantations) are aimed at harming some people; this happens when thosepeople are respected or liked by the Djinns and Afarit.40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Yes, those creatures are known to be loyal to their friends.In fact, the Djinns and Afarit protect them and create “Houdoud” (A barrier,a Fence) around them to shield them from danger and threats. Interaction with humans:Djinns and Afarit play an active role in the life of humans, and are able ofinfluencing and/or altering major events.According to Islam (The Prophet and the Koran), all of us have a Djinn-Sharik, a “Partner-Djinn”.In Hadith Sharif, the Islamic scholars and companions of the ProphetMohammad mentioned Djinns and Afarit as “Constant partners orcompanions of people.”They wrote extensively on the interaction of Djinns/Afarit with people, andhow occasionally they steal things from them, and move objects around ormake them disappear.In Bukari’s Hadith we read:“Close your doors and keep your children close to you at night, because theDjinns moved around during the night, and snatch things.”The Hadith even warned the believers against Djinns and Afarit’s dangers,threats and even burning down houses.The Hadith stated, “When you go to bed, make sure to put out your lights,because the evildoer could drag away the wick of the candle and burn yourhouse and those who live in your house...” 41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Djinns and Afarit’s shapeshifting.___________________________________ 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Iblis (Ibliis) shapeshifting according to an ancient Islamic manuscript.43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"An ancient Persian drawing of angels bowing before Adam at the time he wascreated by Allah, except Ibliis who refuses to do so according to the Koran. _____________________________44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Djinn Malak Al Ahmar.________________________________45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Persian Djinns.46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Aladdin transported (Lifted) by a Djinn.

However, their favorite drink is beer, and their favorite meal iswell-cooked meat, like their creators the Anunnaki gods and goddesses wholived in Mesopotamia.

Infact, according to Hadith Sharif, the Prophet Mohammad advised one of hiscompanions not to be the first person to enter the Souk (Market), or the lastperson to leave the Souk, because the Souk is the devil, Afarit and Djinns’favorite hangout. *** *** ***49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Djinns and Afarit watching the arrival of King Solomon.An illustration from the 17th century._________________________________ Solomon and the Djinns/Afarit.

Iwant to share it with you because it is based upon my personal experience, andespecially because it sheds light on the nature of these creatures, which is rarelydiscussed in western literature.The second story is based upon what my Teacher Honorable Master RabbiMordachai told me about a very special kind of Afarit and Djinns whoaccomplished extraordinary things in Eastern Europe, and which will take yourbreath away. First story: Beit al Jin in Baalbeck (Baa’laback):At one time, a large community of lower entities called “Beit al Jin” (Houseof the Djinns) strived underground near the ruins of the Roman temples ofBaalbeck. The Beit was guarded by three principal djinns who shape-shifted constantly, during their first contact (Apparition) with human beings.According to a local legend, some of these lower entities were the remnantsof the Afarit who have served King Solomon. One of the entrances leading59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"to their Beit, was situated under the massive stone of “Hajarat Al Houblah.”I graduated from high school at seventeen, and was free for a while. Muchthought had to be given to the decision and preparations for my universitystudies. I expressed a desire to go to Paris for that purpose, and wasconsidering various fields, but nothing was final. I did not mind a little timeoff, though, and enjoyed my temporary idleness very much.At that time, Master Li was visiting us, and as usual, had an incrediblyexciting plan for me.“Have you ever been to Baalbeck?” he asked.“No, never.”“It’s an interesting city, very old.There is a lot of controversy as to who built it, though.”“Isn’t there some historical evidence?”“Plenty, but there are four interpretations.The Christian Lebanese say it was built by the Phoenicians. The MuslimLebanese prefer a theory claiming it was built by Djinn and Afrit. Someimportant occult leaders say it was built by Adam, after he was kicked outof Paradise. Well...”“And the Ulema, what do they think?” I asked, knowing that this was thetheory I would trust.“The Ulema say it was built by the Anunnaki and the proto-Phoenicians wholived on the island of Arwad and in Tyre. There is a lot of evidence in thisdirection.”“So will I see the ancient parts?”“Of course. I would like to take you to a very special part of the city, wherethe Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to meet thousands of years ago.Unfortunately, we no longer meet there, because it became a touristattraction and a state-controlled center of music and dance festivals. It willbe fun for you, though, to mingle with all these tourists, it’s a nice place.”“But surely that is not the reason for going,” I said.“No, it is not. I plan to take you to a secret underground city underBaalbeck, and show you where the Anunnaki landed for the first time onearth. Very few people know what is going on under the modern city ofBaalbeck.The first Anunnaki landing took place before the Deluge, though they cameagain and again after the Deluge as well.”“Before the Deluge? When was that, exactly?” I asked.“About 450,000 years ago, perhaps a bit longer. At that time, the Anunnakicreated the humans.”“And what about God?” I asked. Even though I was taught much of the60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Ulema traditions and world view, I never heard about the creation of thehuman race.“No one ever heard of God 450,000 years ago. You start to hear about Godonly around 6,000 years ago,” said the Master. I knew enough about theAnunnaki at that time to accept this without much trouble, so I went to findMama and Sylvie and tell them about the upcoming trip.The trip from Damascus to the old city of Baalbeck could be accomplishedin about two hours, at least you could do that if you traveled in a decent car.We took a bit longer to get there, since the car, borrowed from a friend ofthe Master who was also to drive us there, was an ancient Mercedes thatdid not use normal gasoline but rather employed mazut, or diesel fuel, andmade such a racket it was impossible to hear yourself think.To my surprise, I saw a mysterious Sudanese man sitting in the back seat,dressed in ill matching jacket and pants and scowling at us.At the Master’s request, he started to get out of the car to introduce himself.I watched the process in fascination, since he was not doing it quickly like anormal person, but instead was slowly extricating himself in stages,gradually disentangling himself, like a huge snake. I have never seen such atall man, or anyone as strange.He was about seven feet tall, very thin, and his face did not look quitehuman to me, but like a giant from outer space.This bizarre apparition just stood there, looked fierce, and played with astring of amber beads. The Master ignored his uncouth behavior andintroduced us.“This is Taj,” he said. “His name means ‘Crown.’ He is joining us becausehe has the key to the gate of the secret city underground. He is also able topersuade the Djinn and the Afrit to open certain doors, which is quite atalent.”I was not sure if the Master was joking about the Djinn and the Afrit, so Ikept quiet, nodded to the Sudanese, and got in the back seat.Taj folded himself back into the car and sat beside me, the Master went intothe front seat, and the driver, who seemed to be normal and cheerful, greetedthe Master and me in a friendly way.The car started making a noise that was worthy of demons, but I did not carebecause I was thinking about the real devils, the Djinn and the Afarit.I leaned forward and asked the Master, “Would I be able to see the Djinnand Afrit?”“Yes, of course,” said the Master casually. “You can even try to talk to them,if you like. The underground city is actually called the City of the Djinn andthe Afrit; plenty of devils are there.”61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Since these devils did not seem to frighten the Master, I assumed he knewwhat he was doing, and sat thinking about what my part could be in thisunbelievable adventure. However, I was aware of increasing irritation bywhat Taj was doing.He constantly played with his amber beads, clicking away on and on. Iasked, “Why do you have to click these things all the time?”Taj seemed annoyed by my question. “Try them yourself,” he said curtly, andhanded them to me. I grabbed at them, and instantly, a horrible electric shock went through myentire body, quite painfully, and I cried out and threw the beads on the floorof the car. The Master screamed at Taj, “How dare you? How many timesdid I tell you never to do that? Give me the beads immediately!”Taj handed him the beads, meekly enough, and had the grace to lookembarrassed. The Master rubbed the beads, seemingly absorbing andremoving the energy, and then returned them to me. “You can try them now,”he said.“And don’t give them back to Taj until I tell you to.”Taj said nothing. He seemed unhappy in the car, constantly fidgeting, andcould not sit still.Perhaps he was claustrophobic, I thought, and the confined space botheredhim. We drove on.Finally we arrived in Baalbeck. “Where now?” said the driver.“We are going to the Athar, the ruins,” said the Master.“I don’t know how to get there,” said the driver. “Shall I ask fordirections?” He parked the car. There were many people around, someArabs in traditional garb, some Europeans in every kind of attire andcarrying backpacks and cameras. It seemed to be such a normal, cheerfulplace. I thought of the festivals and the music; how could there be Afrit andDjinn and all sorts of underground labyrinths in a place like that? It was asmodern as can be.“When you are with Taj, you do not ask for directions,” said the Sudanesewith a superior air. The driver shrugged, not quite convinced.Taj winked at me and stared at the driver’s neck, concentrating. The driversuddenly started to beat his own neck, complaining how much he hatedmosquitoes. I was certain there were no mosquitoes in the car, and I wassure that Taj created the imaginary insects that were tormenting the driver.The driver’s neck became really red.“Taj, stop this nonsense immediately!” said the Master severely. Apparently,Taj could send certain energy rays that had the capacity of annoying people.Taj stopped, gave the driver the necessary directions, and we went to the62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Athar.“First, let’s go to the world biggest stone,” said Taj. We drove further, andas we turned a road toward the Temple of Jupiter, I was shocked by the sightthat met my eyes. It was a huge gray slab, partially buried in the sand,perfectly cut and smooth.It was unquestionably man made, not a natural formation, a short distancefrom the Temple. How in the world could such a stone get there?Who could have carried it?This stone was so immense that the stones of the Egyptian pyramids wouldbe infinitely small, completely dwarfed, if put next to it.The Stonehenge monoliths would be insignificant if they were placed next toit. In addition, it was immensely old, and even modern equipment couldhardly cope with such a giant, let alone ancient technology.“How big is this stone?” I asked, truly awed by the sight.“Seventeen hundred tons,” said the Master.“It is hand made, isn’t it?” I said. “It is too straight to be natural. It simplycan’t be natural. And yet, how could it get here, if it is artificial? It justcan’t!”Taj grinned and said, “Hand made, yes, but not by human hands.”I was beginning to get the idea. “Then who made it?” I asked.“It was part of the landing area used by the Anunnaki,” said the Master.“There are six stones like it. Only the Anunnaki could move such a slab.”“Ah, but I can make it fly,” boasted Taj.“You must be crazy,” I said, disgusted with him.“You want to see?” He said.“Sure,” I said. “I would like to see you do that.”“Very well, but not when so many people are around. We will be backaround nine o’clock, no one is around, I will show you.”Since it was around four o’clock in the afternoon, I was wondering how wewould spend the time, but the Master had his own plan.“We have plenty of time to do what needs to be done,” he said. “I wouldlike you to meet Cheik Al Huseini.” This was the first time I met the greatman, who later contributed greatly to my studies.We went back into the car, and drove to the Cheik’s house. The house wassmall and modest, built sturdily of stone, with thick walls. The door waslow, as was normal for middle class Arab houses. This style was followedfor many years, for the sake of safety and security.Apparently, the conquering Ottomans used to sweep into houses that hadlarge entrances while riding on their horses, and thus be able to kill anddestroy anyone and everything inside. The low entrances forced the rider to63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"get off his horse first, making him much less dangerous to the inhabitants. In the big living room, which they called the Dar, many sofas were placedagainst the walls, arranged next to each other. About twenty to thirty menwere present, dressed in Arab robes and turbans. All were elderly, withlong white beards. The Cheik was sitting in the place of honor.When the Master arrived, everyone stood up, repeating the word “oustaz,oustaz,” to each other, meaning “teacher.” Someone pointed at Taj, and said,“The Afrit is already here.”I thought this description fitted Taj perfectly, but expected him to be angry.To my surprise, he seemed pleased by being called that name, and grinned atme like a delighted child.We sat down, and the men came to kiss the hand of the Master. The light waslow, only one lamp was turned on, but I could see that one person did notget up from his seat. Since this was strange behavior, I looked at himcarefully, and to my amazement recognized the old Tuareg, whom I had metyears ago in the suk in Damascus, the man who was cut in half.He recognized me as well, smiled, and motioned to me to come and sit byhim. I came, and he said jokingly, “Don’t start searching for the rest of mybody...”I laughed, a little guilty, because that was exactly what I was planning to do.At any rate I could see nothing, since the long robe he wore coveredeverything.Everyone conversed in Arabic, which by now I spoke very well, and after awhile the Cheik motioned most people out. Eight of us remained in theroom.The Master, Taj, and myself, were the only outsiders.The Cheik, the Tuareg, and three other elderly Arabs completed the numberof the people who were permitted to attend.At that moment, a man came from an inside room, carrying a big copper pot,full of steaming hot water. He put the pot on a table in front of the Cheik,addressing him by the title Mawlana.This title meant “you are a ruler over me,” and was used only to addresskings, sultans, or prophets. I was surprised. This title belonged to veryimportant people, but the house and everything in it spoke of middle class.So what could this mean? The Cheik must have been a very importantperson, somehow. I planned to ask the Master about it later, not wishing todisturb him with questions at the moment, since I was sure strange thingswere about to begin to occur.I was sitting near enough to the Cheik to see everything very clearly, and64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"waited breathlessly for the events that were to come. The Cheik took threepieces of blank paper, and threw them into the hot water in the coppercontainer.The room was completely silent, no one moved, except Taj, who whisperedto me, “You are going to like what you see, it’s fun, but don’t move nomatter what happens.” I nodded, and concentrated on the pot, lookingoccasionally at Taj for clarification.Somehow he assumed the role of my guide to the occult world, and Irealized he knew exactly what was taking place. “Shush, just look at thecontainer, something is about to happen,” he said. I went on staring at thepot.Suddenly, in a blink of an eye, the water in the container disappeared, andthe three pieces of paper burst out of the container. They lined up in the air,without any support, one after the other. They waved about for a fewseconds, then merged and became one larger piece.The piece of paper started swirling in the air, rotating around itself, quickerand quicker, and suddenly stopped in mid motion. It was suspended in theair, completely still, and in a flash, letters appeared on it, printed clear,black, and easily visible from where I was sitting, though I could not makeout the words. The Cheik got up, approached the paper, read the words, and then asked oneof the people attending to close the shutters on all the windows. The roombecame very dark, and the words, seemingly separated from the paper,glowed in air like a bright hologram.The Cheik called Taj, and asked him to read the words. I could not hearwhat they said to each other, but they seemed to agree on something, as theystood there, nodding their heads.Then Taj came back to me.I asked him, “What was that?” He stepped on my foot to quiet me. His largefoot’s imprint was painful, so I shut up. Everyone else seemed to accept thephenomenon without trouble, and gazed at the Cheik as he began to move ina strange manner.He looked to the left, mumbling something incoherent, then to the right,saying the same incomprehensible things, repeating the sequence twice.Then he lifted his hands as if in prayer, in the manner shared by both Jewsand Muslims. Touching his chest and pushing his hands in front of him, hesaid, “Ahlan, ahalan, ahlan, ahalan, bee salamah.”The letters were still glowing in front of him in the air, and he added,“Asma’ oo hoosmah ath sab’ha.”65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"I turned and pinched Taj, whispering feverishly, “Explain!”“Don’t you know anything?” said Taj. “These are the names of seven Afrits.They are going to open the gate of the underworld for us.”“But...” He stomped on my foot again to shut me up, and it really hurt and Ikept quiet.The Cheik said, rather loudly: “Bakhooor, bakhooor!” A man appeared outof nowhere and brought an incense holder. The Cheik moved it back andforth, the room filled with smoke, and everyone started to chant and mumblevery loudly.I understood nothing at all of what they said.It seemed they were speaking in tongues, and the effect was frightening.They went on for a couple of minutes, then stopped abruptly.At that instant, the letters pulled together, became one shining ball of light ofintense silver color, and zoomed out of the room into thin air.One of the people opened the shutters and the late afternoon light streamedin. The Cheik put his right hand on his heart and said “Thank you” threetimes.I was wondering who exactly he was thanking, and who, originally, was hepraying for, since he never used the words God, Allah, or any otherrecognizable deity name. I did not realize at the time that the Ulema, evenwhen they were Arabs, where not Muslims, and had their own, verydifferent, world view.The Master got up. Everyone rose with him, their robes swishing andmaking a faint sound in the quiet room. The Tuareg floated in the air. Ilooked at him, doing my best to control my discomfort.His upper body was solid, but the bottom half of the robe was obviouslyempty as it swirled around him, making the absence of his lower bodyextremely and disturbingly clear. He seemed like an apparition, a ghost.Everyone came to the Master, bowed to him, and then grabbed his hand withboth of theirs, in a way that was clearly ceremonial.The right hand’s thumb was hitting the spot between the thumb and firstfinger of the left hand, and then the left hand covered the right hand.The Tuareg floated near the master and did the same thing. Everyone lookedat each other and thanked each other a few times, following their thanks withthe words “Rama Ahaab.” I did not know this word, and was not aware thatthey were speaking Ana’kh, the language that was shared by the Anunnakiand the Ulema.And yet I sensed that there was something very special about the way theyspoke, as if by instinct. I was staring at the people and trying to understandtheir words until the Master tapped me on the shoulder and told me to come66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"out. Taj left with me, and said, “You talk too much. You should be payingmore attention, such an occasion is not likely to happen again!” I shrugged,but I had to admit to myself that he was right, these events were probablyunique.To my surprise, I was beginning to like the Sudanese, and no longer feltthreatened by his strange appearance and bizarre behavior.“Won’t you tell me a bit about the Afrit?” I asked, licking my lollipop. “I amnot sure why we need to call them. Why can’t we just go into theunderground city? I don’t quite understand anything that is going on here.”“In your home, in France, do you have a Jaras, a bell, on your door?” heasked.“Yes, of course,” I said, surprised at the question.“Well, you see, the underground city do not have a Jaras, and it is locked. Ifyou want to come in, someone must let you in. The Afrit can help you, butyou have to call them in a special way. Otherwise, they don’t know youwant them to open the door. How would they know? They are not tooclever.”“Where is the door?” I said.He pointed to the ground. “Under you, under the house, there is a door. Rightunder the Cheik’s house. A door to the Aboo, the deep abyss. It is alsocalled Dahleeth, meaning an underground labyrinth.”“Are there other doors?”“Very likely, but I only know this one.”As if reading my mind, he put his hand in the inner pocket of his ill fittingand flashy jacket, pulled out two lollipops, and handed me one.One of the people came out of the house, motioned to us to come in, andsaid, “We are ready.” In the house, everyone was wearing a white robe, andto my surprise, their heads were covered with the type of head scarf Jewssometimes wore in the synagogue. To confuse the issue even further, onewas holding a scroll that resembled a Torah.I felt desperate. Were they going to delay our journey again and startpraying? I really wanted move on, see the Afrit, have the adventure. I wastired of the delays. Thankfully, one of them handed me a robe andcommanded me to go change my clothes, which I did, but Taj did not changehis attire.I asked him why he was not required to do so, and he explained that he wasnot one of the Al Moomawariin, or the enlightened ones, so he was notrequired to wear the special outfit.This did not really clarify the matter, since I was not one of the enlightenedones either, but I decided to let it pass.67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Taj seemed to be right about the door being under the Cheik’s house,because we started to descend the steps to the basement. The basement waslong and narrow, and had a very high ceiling, perhaps the height of twostories.Everything, floor, walls, ceiling, were made entirely of gray cement. Itsmelled of dampness, and was very cold.We went through a one room after another, all narrow and long, eventuallyreaching a small room that had an iron gate by its far wall. The Cheikopened the gate with a large key, and behind it was a second door, made ofthick wood. A second key opened this one. Suddenly a thought struck me.Why did he need a key?Why couldn’t a man who had such supernatural powers simply command thedoors to open? Or pass through them like a ghost, for that matter?I expressed my thought to Taj. “It won’t work,” said Taj. “Yes, of course theCheik could pass through doors, but how would he take you with him?”“What do you mean?” I asked, bewildered.“You are not enlightened as yet.You cannot use supernatural means of transportation at this stage, so if hewants you, or me, for that matter, to pass through these doors, he must takeyou inside in a normal way.If he tried, you will just bang against the doors and hurt yourself, while hewould be on the other side.”I began to see that Taj was not stupid at all. Childish, and sometimespretending to be silly and play silly games, but deep down, he wasextremely knowledgeable.We stood together in the small room, exactly like all the other rooms in thebasement. The Cheik said, “Let the boy be the last one. He needs protection.Taj, come here.”Taj joined him at the front of the line, and we entered a long corridor. As wewere walking, the corridor began to shift its shape.I felt seasick, nauseated, my balance was lost. The floor, and walls,everything was moving, rolling, undulating.I did not see clearly, and wondered how long this torment would last, whensuddenly all movement stopped.I looked around and nearly jumped with terror. The simple corridor becamea cave!A natural cave, not a man made structure.Stone, dirt, and natural formations were all around me. It smelled damp andfilthy, water were oozing from some of the walls, and the light was dim. Idid not like the place.68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":" The Master told everyone except me to stand in a crescent shaped row, andhold hands.

I felt neglected, as if I were not part of the group, untilone of the people turned to me and said kindly, “Don’t be upset, my boy.This is for your protection.”So I just stood there behind the people, feeling silly in my long white robe,but not unhappy anymore.At that moment, Taj made a sweeping motion with his hands and body, andscreamed a few words. The horrible sound he emitted was not human. Itwas very likely the loudest sound I had ever heard.He continued to move his hands violently, grabbed some dirt from theground, and threw it up in the air. He pronounced a word that to me soundedlike a name, and followed it by the word “Eehdar!” three times.Then he said, “Oodkhool,” three times. Immediately, a rubbery kind of formmoved to the left, changed to a paste-like substance, and attached itself likeglue to the wall. The sticky, pale mess looked like ectoplasm.Taj repeated his actions a few times, manifesting a new ectoplasmicmanifestation on the wall with each call. Then, he looked at the Cheik andsaid, “Tamam!” The Cheik and Taj were engaged in a conversation in low voices. Theyseemed to be in agreement, since the Cheik said, “Yes, go ahead.” Tajadvanced toward the ectoplasmic forms, put his hand in his jacket’s pocketand took something out, and gave some to each of them.At this moment, the Cheik stepped forward, ready to take over, and said“Iibriiz!” The forms burst into flame, which burned the ectoplasm andproduced a thick fog. From the fog appeared human forms, but there wereonly six of them.The Cheik said “Wawsabeh!” The Master came forward, stood by theCheik, and the Cheik repeated the word, adding, “Anna a’mooree khum!”and the seventh creature came.Later Taj told me that these Afrit were originally created by the Cheik for areason, as they usually are, and in the normal state of events were supposedto become the Cheik’s loyal servants.However, the Cheik made a mistake and did not perform the exactrequirements needed in the procedure of the creation, and therefore he lostcontrol over the Afrit.The result was disturbing.The seven Afrit developed independent and rather evil habits, and did not69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"quite obey the Cheik as they should. For some reason, the only one whocould call them to appear was Taj.However, that is all he could do. Since Taj was not an Enlightened One, hecould not control them once they came, and to a certain extent was at theirmercy and had to have an Ulema present if he were to avoid potential harm.As for another Ulema controlling them instead of Taj and the Cheik, that wasnot possible. The Ulema have four categories, based on their form ofexistence. Some Ulema are physical and live as humans, like the Master andthe Cheik. Some used to be physical, but were no longer so.Some, like the Tuareg, straddled both forms. Others have never occupied ahuman form. All four versions of the Ulema can exercise immense powers,no matter if they are physical or non physical, but a physical Ulema can onlycontrol non physical entities, such as these Afrits, if he was their creator. I shuddered as I watched the Afrit. At this point of my studies, I had myshare of supernatural incidences, but I have never been so shaken before. Inthe semi darkness of this miserable, damp place, the Afrits were trulyterrifying.Each had a more or less human face, but in this almost normal face the eyeswere not at all normal. Instead, each Afrit had two circular orbs, with whitebackground and a black pupil that stood out as if painted. The eyes did notmove.If the Afrit wanted to look to the side, it had to move its whole head. Thehead was not connected to the body. Instead, it floated in a disconcerting,eerie fashion, just above the body. When the Afrit manifest, their bodiesoften appear first and for a few minutes appears headless, until they chooseto manifest the head.This fact, coupled by their appalling ugliness, can frighten a human being tothe point of death. There had been recorded incidents of people dying ofheart attack or stroke caused by such events.I kept myself as calm as possible and continued to study the Afrit. The headswere bad enough, but the bodies were even worse.They were tinted a shadowy, ugly, dark color. The torso resembled theshape of a bat. Their arms were attached to the back of the body, and thehands had extremely long fingers. Since the Afrit don’t eat or breathe, theydon’t need a stomach and a diaphragm.Therefore, the body had a sort of visible cavity in the front, where theseorgans would have been.The legs were twisted, like entangled wires, which must help the Afrit asthey jump. They rarely stay in one place for long, and keep shaking and70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"moving and twitching.They looked back at us, their ugly faces twisted in a devilish, vicious smile.They kept chattering among themselves and pointing at us with their longfingers.But Taj told me that despite their apparent boldness, they were afraid of theEnlightened Ones. Any Afrit can see the shining auras of the Ulema, and forsome reason they are terrified of these auras.The Cheik commanded the Afrit to open the door. I did not understand thelanguage he spoke, but I figured it out because he used the word “Babu,”which is so similar to the word Ba’ab.Babu is really a door, though, while ba’ab is a gate, but the words wereclose enough to make it clear to me that they were going to open the door tothe underground world.I was speechless with anticipation. Everyone stood still, looking at the farwall of the cave, so I stared at it too, not knowing what to expect.The far wall of the cave suddenly collapsed, in total silence. It felt like asilent movie, because there was no dust and no sound of falling stonesduring the procedure. The stones tumbled down quietly, one by one,disappearing altogether rather than forming a solid pile.The wall was replaced by dark, hazy fog, that allowed us a glimpse of somefar away buildings. “Now,” said the Cheik to Taj, “Let’s follow the Afrit,but don’t let them play tricks on you.”Taj nodded. We went through the fog, following another corridor andcrossing identical rooms that seemed to follow each other in succession, allthe while seeing the far off buildings in the distance.The Cheik started reciting something.The Afrit were jumping up and down like carousel horses, while pushingforward with great speed, and were already a good distance away from us,going on their own mysterious errands.Taj said to me, “You can now move to the front, it’s safe now, the Afritwon’t pay much attention to us anymore.” I quickly moved near the Masterat the head of the line, and no one took notice of what I was doing. We didnot move on yet.The Cheik asked Taj to show him a piece of paper he was holding, probablya kind of a map, and asked, “Do you know which room we need?”“Yes,” said Taj. “I know exactly where it is, it’s very near us. I will go in,and if I find something, I will bring some pieces back to you so you can seethem, and then we can all go in and bring everything.”Taj left for about five minutes, and returned with a beautiful pearl necklace,a few diamonds, and some Phoenician coins.71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"He told the Cheik and the Master, “We can go in now, but remember, youpromised that all the gold belongs to Taj.”“Of course,” said the Cheik casually. “But remember,” said the Master, “Weare not just going into the treasure room. You will also take us to the otherroom, as you promised.”It was clear to me that the Ulema were not in the least interested in thetreasure, but there was something else in this underground cavern that meantmuch more to them than any gold or diamonds.The Ulema do not need gold. They can manufacture whatever wealth theyneed, and they never manufacture or acquire more than they need. Riches areof no interest to them at all.“Certainly I will take you to the other room,” said Taj. “I know exactlywhere it is.” He seemed quite pleased by the bargain.We followed Taj into a small, closed room. It had no windows but wasbrightly lit, allowing us to see gold, gems, diamonds, and pearls stashed inboxes, jars, or simply thrown on the floor in heaps. However, I was not veryinterested in gold either.What I wondered about was the source of the mysterious illumination. Nowindows, no lamps, no candles, but bright light in every corner of the room.What could cause this?Suddenly I realized it had to be the same type of light that was discovered inthe Pharaonic tombs and catacombs of ancient Egypt.Originally, the archaeologists who went there were baffled by the light inthe Egyptian tunnels, until they discovered the contraption that the ancientEgyptians had created.They found conical objects that functioned like modern batteries, producinglight that was so much like normal electrical light that there was hardly adifference.The batteries had to be placed in a certain way against each other, or theywould not light, and worse, could burn the user since they packed a lot ofenergy in their structure. I suspected this had to be the same type ofillumination.Taj pointed the door that would take us to the room the Master wished tovisit. The Master asked him, “Do you want to come with us?”“I will follow you as soon as I am finished here,” said Taj, grinning. Hepulled some linen bags from under his jacket, and busily started filling themwith the treasure.The Master smiled indulgently at him, as if Taj was a child playing withsome toys that meant little to adults but pleased the child a great deal. Hesaid to the rest of us, “Well then, let’s go to the next room.”72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"We opened the door. Inside it was pitch black, but the Master stepped inwithout the slightest hesitation, and we followed. I envied his confidence.As far as I was concerned, how did we know an angry Afrit was not waitingfor us?But since no one else showed any fear, I went with them. We could seenothing, but the Master kept talking to us and so we were able to followhim. All of sudden, bright light filled the room.I blinked a few times, and then saw the Master standing by one of the walls,holding two conical, golden objects in each hand, positioned against eachother. I was right, here were the ancient batteries.The room was empty of furniture other than a beautiful wooden table,carved into arabesques, much like Moroccan furniture.The Master placed the batteries carefully on the table, making sure thealignment allowed them to continue to produce light. I looked around. Otherthan the batteries and the table, the only object in the room was a largePhoenician urn, standing in one of the corners.“We are going to leave you here for a short while,” said the Master to thegroup. “The Cheik and I are going to get the materials we need for ourproject.”“We’ll be right back,” added the Cheik with what seemed to me rathermisguided optimism. There were Djinn and Afrit here! Wasn’t anyoneconcerned about these devils?The Master and the Cheik walked to the end of the room, very slowly, withmeasured, matching steps, as if choreographed.Then they reached the far wall, and literally went through the wall to theother side.I was not exactly shocked, since I have seen the Master go through wallsbefore. It is an interesting phenomenon, but not as mysterious as one mightthink.To put it simply, the Ulema know how to control molecules; the Master hadexplained it to me thoroughly. Everyone knows that there is plenty of emptyspace between the molecules of any matter, and the Ulema make use of thatfact with a specialized procedure.As the person who wishes to cross approaches the wall, the wall graduallybecomes soft, as if its molecules fragment themselves, and the human bodysimultaneously does the same.The spaces between the molecules of both grow and readjust. The personand the wall keep their shapes for an instant, then their molecules mingleand allow the passage.At that moment, the person passes to the other side, the molecules separate,73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"and both wall and person become solid and normal again.The rest of us waited for about half an hour.I was beginning to worry. The Cheik said they would be right back!Something must have prevented them from doing so. Perhaps the Afrit, whohas by now completely disappeared, took them away, kidnapped them, andled them somewhere horrible?I asked some of the other people if they knew what was going on, but theyhad no idea where the Cheik and the Master went.However, they did not seem worried, making it clear to me that they trustedthese two to know what to do. “Don’t worry,” one of them said to me. “Theycan handle a lot worse than those stupid Afrits.”“I don’t wish to contradict, Sir,” I said, “but these Afrit seem prettydangerous to me. The way they were pointing and smiling...” The otherslaughed.“I have seen the Cheik and the Master handle much worse entities,” said theman who spoke to me, very kindly. “Remember, the Afrist are cowards.They are mortally afraid of the auras of the Ulema.”“But I understand the Cheik needs some help because of the way he handledtheir creation,” I said.“Yes, this is true,” said the man. “These Afrit did turn out a bit wild. Butwith the Master there, they will never dare to harm them.” I had to becontent with that. So I went in search of Taj, to see how he was doing withthe treasure, perhaps help him finish filling his bags.I called him and was about to reenter the room, but I heard him scream,“Don’t come here!” and he tumbled out of the room, bleeding, and slammedthe door behind him. “The Afrit beat me,” he gasped. “Beat me very badly.”“But Taj, you could handle those seven Afrit so well! What happened togive them power over you?”“Seven? Are you joking? There is a colony here, something like forty offifty Afrit, and they all rushed at me and would not let me take the gold.”“Is it their gold?” I asked. “What do they want it for, anyway? They don’tneed money.”“No, it’s not their gold. It used to belong to the Phoenicians, and now itbelongs to no one in particular. But the Afrit like to play with it. They likeshining things.”“But you are holding one bag, I see.”“Yes, I managed to save one bag. They got all the others, those slimydevils.” He smiled, regaining his composure. “Never mind, though. Afterall, I will be a very wealthy man even with just one bag. This treasure isamazing... Anyway, we must secure the door. Hold the bag for a minute.”74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"He pushed the bag in my hands, turned, and repeated the same words heused when he originally called the Afrit, and gestured in the same way.While he was doing that, I heard shrieks and screams, which he laterexplained was the way the Afrit spoke as they were chased away. “That isthat,” he said, surveying the door with satisfaction. “They won’t bother usagain.” He took the bag and smiled at me through the caked blood and filthon his face.“A successful treasure hunt, ah, Germain? And some day I’ll come back formore.”Back in the other room, I saw, to my considerable relief, that the Cheik andthe Master have returned. The Cheik was holding a stack of forty or fiftysheets made of shiny plastic, or plasma, or glass, and the Master had thesame size stack, but of a different type of material, brownish yellow likecorn.“What is that?” I asked Taj.“I have no idea,” said Taj. “They only told me which room I was supposedto take them to, but they did not tell me what project they were engaged in. Imust say I have a hunch it is something terribly important.” I thought so too, since theCheik and the Master seemed to be extremely solemn, and everyone elsewas completely silent. There was a strong feeling of expectation in theroom.They each put his stack on the table, the Cheik on the right, the Master on theleft, leaving a space between the stacks, and I noticed that the spacematched the size of the stacks.The Master brought the urn from the corner to the table, and made a motionof pouring something out of the urn into the space between the stacks. I sawnothing coming out of the jar, but I figured that it might be an invisiblesubstance.This went on for about twenty seconds, then the Master returned the urn tothe corner. The Cheik took one sheet from his stack, and put it in the spacebetween the stacks. The Master then took a sheet from his own stack, put iton the Cheik’s sheet, and waited a couple of seconds.Then the Master flipped his sheet back side up, and to my absoluteamazement, there was print on the sheet, strong and black, consisting ofstrange symbols and letters I did not recognize.Piling the sheets on top of each other, they did the same to all of them.Surprisingly, the stack, when finished, was reduced in size to about a half ofthe original sheets, even though I could not see it reducing itself while it75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"was worked on. I think that the plasma sheets were absorbed into the corn-like paper as the print was produced, but I am not sure.The Cheik pulled out a silk scarf from his robe, put the stack on the scarf,rolled it, lifted the ends of the scarf and tied them together, all in a ritualisticway. Then he said, “Al Hamdu” twice.They turned to go, and we left the room.The Master, throughout the entire time, paid hardly any attention to me,which bothered me a little. I felt neglected, even abandoned. He must havenoticed my unhappy face, because he put his hand on my shoulder, took meback into the room, and said, “Look!” To my amazement, the room wasentirely empty. The table and the urn had disappeared.I was confused and uncomfortable.I could not understand why all that was necessary.Why Afrit? Why those doors?Where did the table go?What was this document and why was it worth all this effort? He laughed atmy questions and said, “Look at the wall.” The light was dimming as wespoke, and finally disappeared. It seemed this adventure was over, and Isaid, rebelliously, that I wish things were made clear to me, becauseotherwise, I have learned nothing.I will explain everything later, Germain. I promise”“But what about the city you said we are about to see?The city where the Founding Fathers of the Ulema used to come to?The city from before the Deluge?”“So you want to see more? This was not enough?”“Yes,” I said. “Basically, all I saw was you and the Cheik going through awall and Taj fighting with the Afrit, which I admit were scary but were nottoo significant, I believe. I did not see anything remotely connected to theancient city.”“Well,” he said, “in this case, turn, and walk with me. You are alreadywalking in this city.”I looked around, and saw nothing, but he said, “Keep walking, it willcome.”I should have trusted him more fully. After all, when did he ever disappointme? I felt remorseful as the miracle began to enfold in front of my eyes, butthankfully, he did not hold my short term rebellion against me, and went oncheerfully enough.Slowly, the ancient city started to appear like a Polaroid picture in front ofme. The colors of the city were such as I have never seen before, glowingcolors of incredible beauty.76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Master explained that this was because the city was located in a spacethat had the same temperature everywhere, and no pressure on any object.Unlike earth.“What do you mean, Master, when you say ‘unlike earth’ like that? Are wenot on earth?”“No, we have left earth when the Afrit opened the door and made the cavewall collapse. We are now in another dimension,” said the Master.“Everything looks a little different here.” The city became clearer, and Ithought it looked like a holographic projection, either from the past, or fromthe future.The buildings, though beautiful, had a sense of alien, remote places.We were now walking in a well-illuminated street, the windows of thebuildings shining with lights as well. The air was soft and fragrant.“I see buildings and streets,” I said. “But where are the people?”“They are here, but they are invisible to you. Your eyes are not constructedto see them, not yet,” he said.“Well, it is time to leave. Let’s go up these stairs.” We started climbing avery high, stone stairway that led from the street into a destination that wasnot quite visible.I was surprised that we were not retracing out steps into the Cheik’s house,but the Master said there was no need for that, and that exits were availablein various locations, and not as difficult to achieve as entrances.So we climbed the stairs, and when we reached the top, I saw a huge graywall on my left, and noticed that the pavement turned into sand.The huge gray wall was the side of the Anunnaki stone.I understood that we exited from a hole under the big stone, were out of thestrange dimension, and back on earth.“So that is what Taj meant when he said he would make the stone fly?” Isaid.“Yes, a rather poetic way of describing our trip,” said the Master.“Master, I am not wearing the white robe! I am wearing the normal clothes Ileft at the Cheik’s house.”“Indeed, and so is everyone else,” he said, pointing to the rest of thecompany, who were already standing near the giant stone, and wearingnormal clothes.“So what did we come here for? Surely not just to give Taj his treasure?”“We came for the book. Everything we did was much worth it, even theencounter with the unpleasant and stupid Afrit.We have recently heard that the book was here, in this dimension, afterhaving searched for it unsuccessfully for generations. And now we have77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"recovered a copy of the most important book in the world.”“The strange book you printed from the stacks? What is it?”“It is one of the very few copies in existence of what is probably the oldestbook to have ever been written. A book the Anunnaki had valued very much.It is called The Book of Rama Dosh.”I didn’t know why, but a shiver went through my spine when I heard thename of the Ancient book; the sound of the name triggered a reaction in mymind.For a second I had a feeling of tottering on the brink of a dark, warm abyssthat contained something older than the universe, and glowed with endlessstars. It passed quickly, and the Master continued.“In the future, you will have the privilege of studying it. It contains theknowledge that may, some day, save humanity from its own folly. At least Ihope so with all my heart. *** *** *** Second story: Helama-Gooliim Djinns, builders extraordinaires.Helama-Gooliim is the name of a very special and particular Djinns-Afaritentities who were created by Anunnaki-Ulema for the sole purpose ofperforming a good deed. They are part animal, part human, part Golem, partGhoul. A hybrid race.They are made of clay, or earth materials, much like all of us, but they havecertain physical differences from both humans and animals.They look exactly like normal people; they have eyes, hands, feet, etc.“They are not at all like machines or robots. You will not think themanything but human if you saw them...”said Ulema Mordechai.They are born full adult. They are sensitive to light, so they work only bynight, but they are nevertheless great engineers.Ulema Mordechai stated that when the Ulema, and some Kabbalists, reachthe holy level of Kadash Daraja, they can create life. Real life.The creatures would function much like human beings, but they have threedeep fundamental differences: 1-They don’t have a soul,2-They don’t have a physical heart that functions like a bloodpump,3-They don’t have a wired brain. Their essence comes from another dimension, to which they return after78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"their task is done. They are created for that task, and that is their onlypurpose. The creator tells them what to do, and they do it right away. Rabbi Modachai told me: In my case, I have created four of them to buildhouses for poor people in Estonia, and they did it very nicely, overnight.The creation process of these entities:Ulema Mordechai continued: “I create each of them separately. For each, Ibring with me seven pieces of papers on which I write certain codes, and Ihave to have my cane with me.Then I take soil, earth, or clay, and pour water on it to make it pliable. Onceit’s the right consistency, I mold it into a ball. I turn off most of the lights,leaving a very low illumination, maybe one candle or a small lamp, and pullback about four to five feet.I then read a certain text that would encourage the ball to take the next step,which is to shape itself into an oblong of about four feet, and be ready tofollow my special design. At that point I take my cane, walk to the otherside of the oblong, dip the cane into the oblong, and stretch it.I command the oblong to duplicate a human form, and it becomes a statue,lifeless, but similar in every way to the human form. I take the seven piecesof paper, and put two in the eyes, two in the ears, one in the mouth, and oneon the breast, over the heart.I roll the seventh piece as if it were a homemade cigarette, go to the otherside of the statue, and throw the rolled paper at it. It always lands either inthe nose or between the feet, and either position is correct.The statue starts to move and attempts to stand up. At this time I turn aroundand leave the room for a few minutes, so as not to look at the statue as itcomes to life. Seeing the actual transformation is forbidden by the Code ofthe Ulema, as stated in the Book of Rama Dosh.I stand behind the door of the room, and wait until I hear the creature make asound, which tells me that the procedure is complete.I go back into the room, welcome the creature, give it clothes to wear, andpull out all the papers, to keep safely until such time as they are needed todisassemble the creature and send its essence back to its original dimension.I create them to do one single task.When the task is accomplished, I ask them to lie on the floor, next to eachother, return the pieces of paper with the codes to the correct places, andpour water over their bodies.The bodies disappear, leaving earth on the floor, and the essence goes backto where it came from.”Asking the Ulema: “Do they always go away peacefully?” he replied: “No,79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"sometimes they develop a personality, if the task is a bit longer, and theyhave the delusion of being human and want to stay in our dimension.Of course it would be cruel and inhuman to let them stay, not to mentiondangerous, but they do become tricky. So the Ulema or Kabbalist must beeven trickier, and hypnotize the creature into deep sleep. We then put thepapers where they belong and set the paper on fire, and the body startssmouldering.At that time, we pour the water over them and they disappear...they built forme nice houses...The next morning, very early, I went to inspect the houses,and removed the great blanket that covered the area.The blanket is a large plasmic sheet that can create a shield of invisibilityover the entire area. We just refer to it as a ‘blanket’ because it’s a short andeasy name...”Settling comfortably in his chair and sipping his coffee, Rabbi Mordechaisaid, “And now, I promised to tell you the story of the houses I built. Do youwant to hear it?”“Oh, yes, I do,” I said. “I am not sure what you mean by building houses. Ihad no idea you worked in this line.”“Well, I built houses, but I never laid my hands on a stone or a brick,” hesaid, his bright eyes twinkling with amusement.“So you supervised their construction?Like an architect?”“Well, maybe it could be described this way... You will be the judge. Yousee, the people I wanted to help were poor peasants. They had no money atall, they ate meat once a year, maybe, and some of them lived in groups ofeight to ten in one small shack. I decided I had to build them more houses,give them decent living conditions. Luckily, there was a piece of land in the vicinity that did not belong toanyone. I went to look at it, make sure there was water around so we coulddig a good well. I found plenty of water, decided it was the right place, andthen, boom! Overnight, I built them ten houses. Come to think of it, I hadsome preliminary preparations to do, so it really was not exactly overnight,but more like twenty-four hours.”“But it takes more than twenty-four hours to build even a single room, letalone ten houses! Did you have hundreds of people to help you?”“The work was done by four individuals and one enormous blanket,” saidRabbi Mordechai. “Getting them was what I referred to as preliminarypreparations.”“Did you say blanket, Rabbi Mordechai, or did I misunderstand you? What80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"does a blanket have to do with building houses?”“No, you heard me right. The four individuals did not wish to be observedas they were building the houses.”I sat there, watching him a bit suspiciously.Was he trying to confuse me, see how I would react to this fairytale? Orperhaps it was some sort of a test? Or maybe I was just so stupid that I didnot understand?Rabbi Mordechai looked at me and said, “I can see that you feel that fourare not enough to build ten houses overnight, right?”“No way,” I said.“For a really important good cause, Germain, I can use one individual tobuild something bigger than the Eiffel Tower, and in seconds.”Rabbi Mordechai was never drunk. My mother told me that he was a real“Russian bear” and could polish a whole bottle without any effects. Soobviously he could not be drunk now, when all I saw him take was Turkishcoffee.But for a few moments I seriously suspected that he was.Nor was he crazy.So what nonsense was he telling me? And then I suddenly rememberedsomething that Mr. Markowitch said. Rabbi Mordechai, he said, was analchemist. It had little to do with building houses, but still, as an alchemist,he had powers. And then something else connected to it in my mind. Henever said his helpers were four people. He said they were fourindividuals. Could these individuals be like the Afrit I saw in Baalbeck?The thought was so sudden, so disturbing, that I was startled and looked athim with apprehension, and I think he read my mind because he said, “No,they are not what you think. Not like those you saw in Baalbeck, anyway.There are other sorts, you know.”“I had no idea that you knew about my meeting with the Afrit,” I said. “Howdid you know I was thinking about them, anyway? Do you read my mind?”“No, no. I don’t read your mind, but what you thought was very clear andshowed on your face. The Master told me all about your education,remember? And I know that the first meeting with the Afrit would make astrong impression on anyone. Anyway, my individuals were much betterthan the Afrit you met. All Afrit are basically stupid, but mine, at least,listened and obeyed.”“Are they spirits, are they humans, part human? What are they?” I asked.“Mine are called Ghooliim.”“This strange name sounds somewhat familiar,” I said, “but I can’t quiteplace it.”81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"“Yes, you are right, and this is a very good observation!

They are sensitive to light, by the way, so they work only bynight, but they are nevertheless great engineers.”“Where do you find them?” I asked.“I make them,” said Rabbi Mordechai.“You make them? Really? So they are like machines?Robots?”“They look exactly like you and me, they have eyes, hands, feet, etc. Theyare not at all like machines or robots. You will not think them anything buthuman if you saw them.” I leaned forward in my chair, shaken by what I was beginning to understand.Can he do the impossible, can he be playing God? “So you actually createliving, breathing, thinking creatures? The Afrit I met where merely conjuredspirits, but you are talking about something else, I think. A different level ofbeings.” “When the Ulema, and some Kabbalists, reach the holy level of KadashDaraja, they can create life.Real life. The creatures would function much like human beings, but theyhave three deep fundamental differences.

I command the oblong to duplicate ahuman form, and it becomes a statue, lifeless, but similar in every way to thehuman form.I take the seven pieces of paper, and put two in the eyes, two in the ears, onein the mouth, and one on the breast, over the heart. I roll the seventh piece asif it were a homemade cigarette, go to the other side of the statue, and throwthe rolled paper at it. It always lands either in the nose or between the feet,and either position is correct.The statue starts to move and attempts to stand up. At this time I turn aroundand leave the room for a few minutes, so as not to look at the statue as itcomes to life. Seeing the actual transformation is forbidden by the Code ofthe Ulema, as stated in the Book of Rama Dosh.I stand behind the door of the room, and wait until I hear the creature make asound, which tells me that the procedure is complete. I go back into theroom, welcome the creature, give it clothes to wear, and pull out all thepapers, to keep safely until such time as they are needed to disassemble thecreature and send its essence back to its original dimension.”“And you do that after the task is done.”“Right, since the Ghooliim are created to perform a single task. When thetask is accomplished, I ask the Ghooliim to lie on the floor, next to eachother, return the pieces of paper with the codes to the correct places, andpour water over the bodies of the Ghooliim. The bodies disappear, leavingearth on the floor, and the essence goes back to where it came from.”“Do they always go away peacefully?” I asked.“No, sometimes they develop a personality, if the task is a bit longer, andthey have the delusion of being human and want to stay in our dimension. Ofcourse it would be cruel and inhuman to let them stay, not to mentiondangerous, but they do become tricky.So the Ulema or Kabbalist must be even trickier, and hypnotize the creatureinto deep sleep. We then put the papers where they belong and set the paperon fire, and the body start smouldering. At that time, we pour the water overthe Ghooliim and they disappear.”“Fascinating,” I said. “I would love to witness the procedure, though I admit some of it would beterrifying. Thinking of the creature stumbling to its feet, trying to get up, in adark room... still, I wish I could witness that.“You will do better than just witnessing. At the right time I will teach youthe whole process, including the codes and the text that needs to be said,”promised Rabbi Mordechai.83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"“I will know how to create life? Really?”I said incredulously.“Why not? Once initiated, you will advance. I tell you, think big! Expecteverything! Grow! That is what I hope you will do. Anyway, the houseswere built very nicely by these obliging Ghooliim.”“And then?”“The next morning, very early, I went to inspect the houses, and removed thegreat blanket that covered the area.”“What is this blanket?” I asked. “We are not talking about a real blanket,right?”“No, it is a large plasmic sheet that can create a shield of invisibility overthe entire area.We just refer to it as a ‘blanket’ because it’s a short and easy name. Anyway,someone saw the houses and informed the police, and soon enough I sawthem advancing on me. Luckily, the captain was an old friend, Sergei, and hehad two policemen with him.“‘What is this?’ he asked me, surprised. He knew the area well and thesehouses did not exist the day before.‘These are houses,’ I said.‘Well, I see that, but how come?How did you occupy the land, how did you build, and what about a license?Surely you don’t have one? And who did you build it for? You know verywell that you will have to abandon this property right away, you have noright to it,’ said Sergei.‘Sergei, my friend, you are asking too many questions...’ I said. ‘When yourwife was dying, and the doctors gave up on her, do you remember whosaved her life?’‘Why, it was you, Rabbi Mordechai,’ said Sergei. ‘Do you think I wouldever forget that? Or my wife, for that matter? She never stops praising yourname.’‘And did you ask any questions then? No, you were too happy to see herwell. And anyway, if you had asked, I would not know how to explain it toyou.’‘You just touched her, and she stood up,’ said Sergei. ‘It looked like amiracle, so I did not want to interfere...’”That rang a bell. I remembered something. “Wait!’ I said to RabbiMordechai, interrupting his narrative. ‘That is exactly what the Master didfor the sick nun, Sister Marie-Ange Gabrielle, who stayed in our housemany years ago, before we went to Damascus...’“Very likely,” said Rabbi Mordechai. “I am sure no one asked too many84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"questions then, either. Anyway, I told Sergei that I have done much morethan just touch his wife, and I put my hand on his shoulder, and explainedsomething very important to him.‘Sergei, everything and anyone I touch, I only do it for humanity’s good.These houses are for poor old people who have no place to live properly.And if I tried to explain to you how I built them in one day, you would notbelieve me.’‘Problem is, Rabbi Mordechai, is that after what happened with my wife, Iwould believe you... I don’t know what to do,’ said Sergei.‘You know that sometimes my methods cannot be explained.Remember when your daughter Irina was having trouble getting into theUniversity?Remember how I transferred the money and got her registered from adistance, and when she got back to the University the next day the secretarywas amazed to see that all was written properly in her log and Irina was aregistered student who had paid her bills, overnight?So I say, don’t ask questions, Sergei. What does it matter?The houses are here now. But you have no reason to worry. If needed, I canmake the houses disappear. Close your eyes for just a minute.’Sergei closed his eyes, and I restored the blanket. ‘Open them now, Sergei.’He did, and practically jumped, so surprised he was. The houses were not there.The two policemen were so scared by this phenomenon that they droppedtheir guns and ran away. Sergei stepped over and picked up the guns,automatically, staring at the direction of the houses that were not there. ‘Thefools,’ he said, almost to himself.‘They probably think it’s the Devil’s work... But Rabbi Mordechai, all yourwork! Making it disappear like that. How? Why?’‘I can bring them back,’ I said. ‘If you close your eyes again, I will do so.’He did, and the houses returned. Sergei was shaken.‘You are playing with my head, Rabbi Mordechai. Are you trying to scareme?’ said Sergei. ‘I know you are not the Devil, but honestly... So you canmake them disappear and appear at will? Won’t it be dangerous to thepeople inside?’‘No, I can get them out first,’ I said.‘But what if my supervisors hear about it and come to inspect?’‘You will give me warning, and I’ll make the houses disappear.’‘Ah, well,’ said Sergei, giving up. ‘I’ll close my eyes to the whole thing andtell my policemen that if they don’t shut up the Devil will get them.’”85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"“What a story,” I said. “And did any trouble follow these events”“No. Strangely enough, nothing ever happened to disturb the people I movedinto these houses. Somehow, the police never talked, and the occupantswere safe. Of course, such houses, built by supernatural phenomena, are notpermanent. They last ten, fifteen years, no more.But when they disappear, I will find another solution. *** *** *** The Afarit.

Why it is so important to know the identity of the “Entity” we are talking toduring a Sihr’s séance?For many reasons will tell you the Rouhaniyiin (Spiritists) and Al-Sahiriin(Sorcerers, magicians) of the Eastern world, who are the earliestpractitioners and fathers of Sihr (Magic, sorcery). Magic and sorcery werenot created in America or Medieval Europe; they were created in North127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"PLPAfrica, Arab Penninsula, the Middle East, The Near East, ancientMesopotamia and Iran, thousands of years ago. In fact, the priests of the earliest royal courts of the Eastern world, and muchlater, caves’ oracles readers in Greece and Anatolia (Asia Minor)established the primordial protocol of communication with all sorts ofentities, Arwaah, souls and spirits.Thus, learning about the Shaksiyah (Identity) and Tabi’ha (Nature) ofsummoned or contacted spirits and entities will facilitate our Itisal (Contact,communication, rapport) with them, for we will know: rotocol:What Nizam (Protocol) and Ousoul (Rules, etiquette) to follow,because each category of those entities has its own Nizam andOusoul. anguage:What Lougha (Language) to use, because each category of thoseentities has its own Lougha. Learning Loughaat (Languages) ofArwaah (Spirits), Djinns, Afarit, Ghouls, and similar entities is a must, forthese entities do not respond to other languages. King Solomon talked toDjinns in their own languages, the Sawda and Rouhaniya. The priests of Melkart spoke to Arwaah and Noble Spirits of Phoenicia inUgaritic, Phoenician and Tahira languages.The contemporary Sahiriin (Sorcercers, magicians) of the Middle East,Arab Peninsula, and North Africa summon Afarit and Djinns in Rouhaniya,Nouraniya, and other local dialects. The Honorable Ulema communicatewith Arwaah and Ascended Masters in Ana’kh, etc.Of course, in this context we are referring solely to the old Arwaah andentities. In other words, we do not need to be fluent in ancient Arwaah’slanguages to communicate with the souls and spirits of our departed ones,and/or dead people from our modern time. rotection:What Difayah and Himaya (Measures of prevention and protection) touse during the Jalsa (Séance), because some of those entities could bevery hostile and dangerous. Many Talabiin (Plural of Taleeb) were hurt byvarious kinds of Arwaah (Spirits). 128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"PCower:Ancient Arwaah and entities of the world of Sihr (Magic, sorcery)have tremendous Idarat (Capabilities) and Kuwaat (Power, influence)which can be solicited and/or obtained by using very particular and precisecommands and spells.Without knowing the true nature and identity of those entities, we will neverknow what kind of commands and Talabaat (Demands, orders) we must useto control them, order them to grant us favors, and be at our total service. You have to keep in mind that there is an enormous difference between thesouls of dead neighbors, relatives and friends and Arwaah, when it comesto magical powers.Our departed ones don’t acquire magical or supernatural powers when theyenter the world beyond. They remain the same, even though many progressthrough the light. Per contra, Arwaah possess enormous supernaturalpowers in virtue of their Shaksiyah (Identity) and Tabi’ha (Nature). alendar:Numerous Arwaah respond to Taaleb and Saher according toRizmana’s (Calendar) pre-requisites, meaning, some Arwaah andentities can be summoned only on this day or that day, on this hour or thathour; they are not like the archangels of psychics and mediums who claim tobe able to call upon the angels and talk to them “on the spot”!There are different categories and identities of spirits and entities which donot respond to our Talabaat (Requests, demands, spells, orders, magicalwritings) if called upon or summomed Ghaltiya (Wrong time to contactthem).Knowing their identity will ipso facto refer us to the Rizmana; the right timeto contact them. This book is unique and extremely useful on so many levels for manyreasons. Mainly because it provides both the beginner and experiencedpractitioner with necessary guidance, methods and techniques tocommunicate with various kinds and categories of entities from the realm ofArwaah, Djinns and Afarit, as suggested and as practiced by the Al-Sahiriin(Sorcerers, Magicians), the Rouhaniyiin (Spiritists) and Al-Mounawariin(Illuminated) in the Near East and the Middle East. It is my strong belief that only Rijal al Arwaah (People of Souls, or People129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"of the Spirits) which encompasse the three previously mentioned “Spirits-Djinn-Afarit” practitioners, and those who have learned the Nizam andOusoul of Al-Arwaah can de facto communicate with the Djinns and Afarit.You, the reader in the Western Hemisphere could join the sphere of theIlluminated Eastern Masters (Mounawariin), and succeed in communicatingwith Djinns and Afarit if you study the Nizam and Ousoul of Al-Arwaah(Protocol, Law and Rules of Spirits), which are explained step-by-step inthis work.And before you commence to study and practice Ilmu Al Arwaah, Al JinnWa Al Afarit (Science or Study of the World of the Spirits, Djinn andAfarit), you have to bear in mind that only those who are pure at heart, andhonorable in their intentions and deeds will succeed in entering the DouniaAl Awaah Al Sharifa, which means entering (or establishing a rapport with)the realm of spirits and entities from another dimension.Goodness of the heart is a prerequisite.And always remember that generosity and compassion are your one wayticket to immortality, and every time you give from your heart, you willgrow one inch taller, and the sky is the limit. Communicating with the SpiritWorld is a spiritual affaire.Put aside your materialistic values and principles, and enter their worldwith pure intent and humility. Failing to communicate with the Spirit-World and/or Djinn and Afarit.__________________________ I have never seen, met and/or witnessed any practitioner in the WesternHemisphere who was engaged in any form of spiritism or magic, or hasclaimed to be able to call upon the spirits, to perform any act or techniquewhich led to spirits’ manifestation, and/or direct communication with Djinnand Afarit.I should know that because I have spent over 55 years in these fields, wrotemore than 200 books on these topics, worked with Ulema, Allamah andRijal al Arwaah, and currently serving as President of the AmericanFederation of Certified Psychics and Mediums. Without any exception, allof them failed in communicating with Djinn and Afarit, for obvious reasons,and mainly because they could not call upon these entities of any level orcategory in their Loughaat (Languages), and command them, using the properterminology and pertinent Talabaat (Demands).130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Yes, Djinn and Afarit have their own language, which were studied andwritten about by Islamic Rouhaniyiin, and spiritists, and which appeared invarious Koutoub Al Arwaah (Books of the Spirits) throughout the centuriesin the Middle East and the Near East, in Arabic (Pre-Islamic and Islamic)and secret texts known only to few Sihr practitioners.Djinn and Afarit are not the souls of your departed loved ones. They are nothumans.They live in a dimension, regular psychics and mediums can’t reach. And ifany of them did, no Djinn or Afarit apparition had ever occurred, simplybecause the psychic or the medium could not communicate with them in theirown language.Djinn and Afarit are not dead people, souls, or spirits; they are livingcreatures like you and me, thus we must talk to them in a language they canunderstand. Communicating with departed persons, and according to western mediumsis possible, and does not require the learning of any particular language;meaning you can consult a psychic/medium like Madame Rozanna RositaEsperanza de Rosario, who speaks only Spanish, and ask her tocommunicate with the spirit of your dead grandpa who spoke only Germanor English, and Madame Rosa Rosita Rozano etc., will communicate withyour grandpa without speaking a single word in German or English!And you ask Madame Rosa Rosita, where is grandpa?Are you really talking to him? In Spanish?What is he saying? (Remember your grandpa never spoke a word inSpanish)?Do you understand what he is saying?Oh Yes! Rosa Rosita understands what your grandpa is saying to her. In fact,Rosa Rositttttttta can understand messages coming from dead people in anylanguage on the planet!And where is your grandpa standing now?You can’t see him.Madame Rosita would tell you, “He is here...I can see him...I feel him, Ihear him, he has a message for you”, etc. etc.A message?Good! Is it in German or English?Because grandpa did not speak Spanish.Oh don’t worry, Madame Rosita in her mediumistic state can understand allthe languages of the world, and interpret all the messages of dead people131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"who spoke in more than 1,000 tongues! Ironically, and surprisingly, suchmediumistic communication between mediums and dead people did happenaccording to people who sought the services and guidance of psychics andmediums! The situation is less complicated when your psychic or medium inMalibu, Los Angeles or on Bourbon Street in New Orleans is American andyou ask him/her to communicate with your dead grandpa who is alsoAmerican. Boom vavoom clean the room, the spiritual communication is adone deal, there are no languages’ barriers here, because both your grandpaand you medium speak the same language, and spiritual communicationbecomes a piece of cake.Really?It is rare but possible, and only if your grandpa is still hanging around in the“40 Day Period Zone”.Nothing like that will ever happen when a true Rouhaniyiin or Sahiriin is inaction. Communication between the two, the Djinn or Afarit and the SihrPractitioner is totally different on so many levels.First, a particular Djinn/Afarit language is used.And second, the apparition or manifestation of the entity (entities) are real.Actually, you will be able to see the Afrit or Djin in the flesh!

In addition, this book instructs the seeker on how to comply with the rulesand pre-requisites necessary during a séance.A strong emphasis is placed upon:1-The structure, alphabet, letters, sentences and meaning of thelanguage of the spirits, Afarit, Djinn, and Arwaah. Thus, the Taaleb(Seeker) will know what to do when he or she hears the voices ofentities during a séance.2-The most powerful commands you can use during a séance, andhow to order the summoned entities to grant you mostneeded/important favors, and assistance in urgent matters, as wellas general commands pertaining to health, the removal ofdifficulties in getting a job, the protection of your home from evilspirits, obtaining an immediate financial relief, and so on.

This book contains a sufficient number of Arwaah phrases, words, andcommands which will help you to summon and command Arwaah andvarious entities.Some entities and spirits will only respond to particular commands and veryprecise words and Talabaat.Thus, you should use the proper words and commands that they understand.There is no way in the world would you be able to summon andcommunicate with spirits, Djinns, Afarit, demons and even Noble Souls(Arwaah Tahira) if you are not familiar with the terminology, vocabularyand phraseology of their languages and the Sihr language.This book will teach you all of the above, and provide you with most usefulphrases needed in your conversation with summoned spirits and entities.It is easy, fun, and fast!

It is extremely important and paramount to understand that in this context,we are exclusively referring to old spirits (Arwaah) and entities whichexisted and still exist in the archaic spiritist realm of the ancient world ofthe Middle/Near East, Pre-Islam, and Islam.Those who are familiar with dead languages and languages of the ancientworld of the Middle East, Near East and Anatolia will immediately noticethat many words in the spirits and entities languages are frequently found invarious languages and scriptures of the ancient world, such as Akkadian,Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Ugaritic, Byblos Script of Phoenicia,Ana’kh (Anunnaki’s language), Aramaic, Hebrew and Arabic. Those Arwaah and entities could be summoned only if they are contacted intheir ancient languages, some of which were written down and preserved inArabic and Sahiriin texts, and shrouded in secrey for centuries. This is whythe practitioners of Sihr (Magic and witchcraft) refer to them as “Entities”and “Arawaah.”However, our departed relatives, parents, friends and even pets could becontacted, and/or reached without using any of the Sahiriin’s languages.It is verly logical, since our departed ones did not speak the archaiclanguages of the Arwaah of the ancient world.If your departed ones spoke English, French or Spanish for instance, you cancontact them in any of these languages, as long as they did not traverse the“40 Day Period” after they passed away.Once they have left the zone of the 40 day period to another dimension, noone, no psychic, no medium, and no practitioner of the black or white artscan contact them.In other words, if you want to contact John Doe who spoke English, inEnglish, go ahead without hesitation, because you are using a language heperfectly understands.You can’t contact him in a language he is not familiar with.Remember there are no foreign languages schools and tapes for learning aforeign language in the afterlife.If you want to contact Mr. Ahmad X or Y, who spoke only Arabic, then youmust try to reach him in Arabic.And if you want to contact an ancient spirit from Babylon or Sidon, then youmust communicate with that spirit in Babylonian or Phoenician.And if you want to contact a Djinn or an Afrit, then you must contact them inone of their own languages which I have included in this book.136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"You can’t summon Al Maymoun or Al Hanoun in English.You can’t reach Maroush in Spanish.You must use one of their archaic languages, for they don’t understandEnglish or Spanish.The same criteria and prerequisites apply to angels and demons.All spirits and entities, including angels and demons have very preciselanguages, and very particular words, phrases, Istijabaat, Talaabat andcommands.And the Talsam (Talismans, amulets), and Kitabaat (Magical writings) arewritten in their own languages, and not in French, English or Spanish!It is very amusing and entertaining –to me- to hear so many mediums tellingtheir customers that they are able to talk to angels and to hear their messagesby simply using telepathy and sensing their vibrational presense, or just bytalking to them in plain English!Nonsense! *** *** *** Languages of the spirits and lightworkers of Sihr.

You can’t summon an entity(Old Spirits) in English, French or in any other language.You must call upon the entities and summon spirits in Rouhaniya (TheSahiriin language), or by using Nouraniya (The Mounawariin’s language),and especially the Ulemite-Ana’kh language.The Sahiriin language is not complicated at all.Essentially, it consists of a few words and a limited number of sentences,commands, Talabaat and spells.You don’t need elaborate expressions and an extensive vocabulary tocommunicate with spirits and entities if you learn the Sahiriin language. Andyou will be able to learn the Sahiriin language in no time.Basically, it was developed by the Sahiriin (Masters of Sih’r “Magic” andwitchcraft) who lived in Persia, Anatolia, the Arab Peninsula, Palestine-Israel, North Africa, and Medieval Europe.The spirits and entities do not speak English, French or any other language,except their own. Worth mentioning here that the spirits and entities we arereferring to are NOT the deceased people and departed loved ones wholived with us on Earth, or the angels you read about in the Bible, and HolyScriptures. The entities described in several parts of this book are totally different fromdeceased people, Muslim, Christian or Jewish celestial beings, andmessengers.And because they are so different from us, they do not understand ourlanguages, nor do they obey to commands given in a language made byhumans. 140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"*** *** ***Origin of the Sahiriin language:The Sahiriin language contains words, terms, names and phrases written inthe archaic Arwaah (Spirits) language. It is Not a human language.Although, numerous Sahiriin words appeared in Kabala, in the Testament ofSolomon, in the secret ritual séances of Melkart, in the ancient Arabic, pre-dating Islam, in the Sufism’s literature, the Dervish’s chants, and other blackmagic chants and spells, they should not be considered as of an Earth’sorigin, or derivations from ancient Near Eastern and Middle Easternterminology. Why should we learn the language of the old spirits?For many reasons, but mainly because:1-By using their language, you will be able to reach and summon themendlessly and indefinitely. You have to remember that you can communicatewith old spirits ad infinitum, because they live simultaneously in multipledimensions, and there is no time limit for contacting them, as it is the casewith our departed loved ones, and other human souls who can be reachedonly, during the 40 day period following their death and right before theycross over, and those who are trapped in the Bilaya zone and MarashMawta (Doomed Zone).2-Communication with old spirits in their particular languages facilitates theprocess of granting and receiving extraordinary favors. Do we need to learn the languages of the old spirits (of any dimension)to be able to communicate with our departed ones?Answer: No.And what if we wish to contact human “souls” or spirits who don’t speakour language?Answer: It is tricky, because human “souls” or spirits do not learn foreignlanguages in the afterlife during the 40 day period following their death andright before they cross over to a higher dimension, and in the Doomed Zone. Consequently, the presence of a translator or an interpreter becomesnecessary.The Sahiriin call the translator “Mitarjam”, who is usually a spiritualmaster.It is derived from the Arabic word “Moutarjem”. ________________________________________141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Chapter FourContacting the Dead and Communicating with Entities.153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"________________________ I. Introduction:No doubt in my mind, you will succeed in summoning some of the entities,spirits and presences, if you diligently comply with the rules, and follow theinstructions of the Sahiriin and the Honorable Allamah.But you have to keep in mind, that no one, nobody on Earth can summon thespirit or the soul of a dead person, once he/she has crossed over to theastral world.“Maat...Maat L’il Abd”, meaning “Once dead, is dead for good andforever...” said word for word, the Honorable Allamah Saleh Sharif AlKuraychi Al Ansari. The 40 day period:He meant that, we, the human beings who are still alive CANNOT contactthe dead, and we will never be able to do so, because humans live in aphysical zone, while the dead live in another zone, far beyond our reach. Inother words, dead people are unreachable, once they cross the bridge oflife, and enter another dimension that follows our third dimension; once the40 day period following their death has expired.So, all those who claim to be able to communicate with the dead are foolingus. However, the Allamah, and some of you, who have assimilated themessages and techniques of the Allamah --which are explained in this bookin utmost simplicity-- will be able to reach spirits and entities who did notyet depart from Marash Mawta/Bilaya (The doomed zone where souls aretrapped).They are still alive, but they do exist in a different form.These entities include the spirits of dead people (Human beings) who arestill trapped in the doomed zone. Some of them have stayed in this macabreand disturbing zone for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.Other entities were never dead; they were created from formulae andgenetic experiments, our mind will never understand or accept. Yet, they doexist. *** *** *** II. Communication with some entities.154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"You will be able to communicate with some of these entities, summon them,ask them favors, and even command them.But who are these entities, if they are not the souls of the departed ones, thesouls of dear friends, siblings, parents, and relatives, we once knew, here,on Earth? These entities and souls (Arwaah) are divided into two groups orclasses: 1-Class one, called Moo-Aa-Zabeen:Can we communicate with them?Yes, we can.Moo-Aa-Zabeen live in Marach-mawta (The doomed zone). Moo-Aa-Zabeen means those who are suffering.It derived from the Ulemite word “Azaab”, which means pain, suffering.Azaab exists in the Arabic language, and means the very same thing.The Moo-Aa-Zabeen suffer because their souls, or spirits (Anunnaki-Ulemause the word Mind) are trapped in the doomed zone, and can’t get out.The Sahiriin do not considered them as “Fully Dead”.Thus, we can communicate with them, and summon some, using techniquesand Itisal summons as provided by the Sahiriin.Moo-Aa-Zabeen were once humans. Do not confuse “Noufous” with Moo-Aa-Zabeen. Noufous is the plural of“Nafs”, which means “Soul” of dead people. Nafs or Nafsiya in Arabic.Nefesh in Hebrew.Those Noufous do not live in the doomed zone, but in the world beyond, therealm of souls (Human souls).We cannot communicate with the Noufous, and therefore, we cannot summonthem. 2-Class two: Haadeeraat, and sometimes, Arwaah:Can we communicate with them?Yes, we can.Haadeeraat, and Arwaah live here on Earth, as well as in multiple layers ofnon-physical-astral-etheric dimensions, incomprehensible to many of us.Haadeeraat means “Presences”; presences of all sorts, kinds and forms ofapparitions and manifestations, such as:EzraelimGaffarimDjinns (Jinns.

But basically, the word Arwaah refers to the souls of angels,demons and afarit. *** *** ***IV. Is there an eternal life after death?Absolutely!But this after-death sort of life is incomprehensible to many of us. I havewritten on this subject, and describe life after death, and differentdimensions of life after death, the realm of spirits and Arwaah, and theworld beyond, in my books on the Anunnaki and Anunnaki-Ulema.I am not going to repeat myself in this book.I advise you, if you are still interested in these subjects, to read my previousbooks and lectures. *** *** *** V. Can we befriend Arwaah and spirits?Absolutely!The Sahiriin have provided us with a list of friendly Arwaah and spirits.They called them:a-Moustajabiin (Those who respond)b-Al Muhibiin (The affectionate ones) However, you have to keep in mind, that many Arwaah are playful andtricky. They love to play tricks on you, and disorient you. This happens formany reasons, as I have explained in my prior work.In some instances, some of these friendly Arwaah and spirits can turn onyou, and possibly hurt you, if you disrespect them, and/or infuriate them by156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"insisting on obtaining favors that they have ignored in the past.The Arwaah and spirits have their own reasons for not responding to this orthat Talabaat, and you must respect this. If you don’t, you could be hurt.Don’t ever think that you have full authority and absolute power over them.You don’t! Keep the Arwaah happy.If you do, you will befriend them forever.And some, will stay with you for the rest of your life, to help you, to guideyou, and to grant you endless favors. *** *** *** VI. Any hostile and dangerous Arwaah and spirits out there?You bet! Plenty! And they are called Shirririin.The Shirririin are divided into four categories: a-Kaabihiin:It is derived from the word “Kaabeeh”, which means bad, baddeed, awful action and awful thoughts. Thus, Kaabihiin becomesthe bad spirits.b-Sharrariin:They are the worst. Derived from the word “Sharr”, which meansevil or from the devil. Thus, Sharrariin becomes the evil spirits.c-Aatiliin:They are the “Devious Spirits”, who respond only to black magic,and are usually summoned to hurt others.d-Fasidiin:Literarily translated, the word Fasidiin means the “Rotten Spirits”who respond to summons intended to disrupt the lives of otherpeople, and bring them all sorts of catastrophes, includingdiseases, illness, and death. Note: Turkey and the Arab Peninsula’s Afarit are extremely disturbing. Forsome reasons not fully explained by the Allamah, these Afarit find a greatsatisfaction in annoying Turkish women.It looks silly to people in the Western Hemisphere, but ask those womenwho have felt their presence, and how they have disrupted their lives foryears, and you will hear an avalanche of incredible stories and testimonies.No! These women are not lunatics.Many of them are highly educated and cultured, and some are universityprofessors, scientists, and even psychiatrists.157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":" *** *** *** VII. Where and how to sit during a séance?a-Any particular locale to set up the séance?Not really.You can open and conduct your séances anywhere, as long as you are alone,and you have all the materials and accessories you need to open a séance,and summon Arwaah, spirits and entities. b-Any particular time to summon the entities and spirits?Absolutely.There are good hours and bad hours to summon the entities. There are alsospecial hours to call upon the Arwaah and angels.I have explained this, at length, and provided “Arwaah Calendars” in myprevious books on the subject. The Sahiriin Shir techniques were never recorded, and written down in asystematic manner.The esoteric techniques were never compiled and classified as a manual,but rather as Dirasaat and Kiraat. They were shrouded in secrecy forcenturies, for almost 1,600 years, and were transmitted from Allamah toadepts and students. Thus, this book becomes the world’s first work of itskind.All the techniques, instructions, Talabaat, commands, and séancessummoning protocol (s) as provided and described in this book are inconformity with the Kiraat and Dirasaat of the Sahiriin, and especially theirsecret Ahaadeeth. I have spent more than 50 years researching and collecting Sahiriinmaterials and work. And I was fortunate enough to study under the wings ofthe most honorable masters in Ethiopia, Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon,Yemen, the Arab Peninsula and other countries.And I have witnessed Sihr extraordinary events, and participated in séancesthat are out of this world; séances, my mind at the time, could and would notunderstand or accept, but finally, I became a believer, because I was there,and I saw what has happened during the Jalasaat, Kiraat and Dirasaat withmy own eyes.The Sahiriin’s techniques work!VIII.

First, “the bad spirits could steal a part of your Nefs, and control it for avery long time.This happens when the Taaleb is a beginner.The Sahiriin masters can control and fully command the bad spirits withoutrisk.But could you?” said the Honorable master Suleiman Tarek bin Ziyad.He added, “Secondly, once your Talaabat are granted, you create an alliancewith the Fasidiin and the lower level of Arwaah.This means, that the bad Arwaah will also be entitled to ask you favors inreturn, such as entering the bodies of other people, usually innocent peopleand frightened souls (Human souls).” *** *** *** II.

You can ask as many favors as you wish. But one favor at a time. Beprecise and brief.9. Usually, the spirits appear in the flesh.But in some instances, they don’t. Instead, they manifest themselves bymoving objects around you. This is an indication of their presence.10. If you are familiar with the “Triangular Paper”, make use of it. This isan excellent way of communicating with the spirits.I have explained this in my book “How to Summon and Command Spirits,Angels, Demons, Afarit, Djinns” Vol 1 on pages 66, 67, 68. Triangular Paper technique:Note: In some summoning séances, you need a stack of papers tocommunicate with entities and spirits. I am taking the liberty of includinghere a synopsis of the “Triangular Paper” technique, taken from theaforesaid book: In some séances, you might need to use papers as Majda. For some reason,sometimes, the entity refuses to talk to you. But you still have another optionto make it/her/him converse with you. How to use it.Follow these instructions:a. Fold a piece of paper in the shape of a triangle and place it onthe ground (Burqua’h, sand, working zone). No particular place isrequired.You can even place the triangular paper outside the Burqua’h. It does notmatter, really. But keep the paper far from the candle. Avoid fire accidents.Expect to witness a most unusual magical display, because the paper isgoing to move in all directions, even jump.b. Now, you are going to engage the entity in a dialogue, a sort of“questions and answers” in motion, meaning that the entity willanswer your questions by either lifting up the paper, or shaking itone time, twice or several times, as per your request.I am going to explain this phenomenon, because I am very familiar with it. Isaw it several times with my own eyes. It is spectacular!!c. Keep in mind you are now conversing with the entity, eventhough the entity is not talking to you.You tell the entity that you are going to ask it/her/him a few questions. If the231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"answer is yes, ask the entity to shake the paper once. If the answer is no, askthe entity to shake the paper twice.d.

Do not worry, if the paper triangle sometimes flies high and fallsback to the ground, or in another area.2. Pick it up and place it again in its original place.3. From now on, you don’t need to repeat the whole questionanymore.For Yes, ask the entity this: Iza Naam Hariki mara waheeda.Translation: If yes move it (Shake it) once.For No, ask the entity this: Iza La, Hariki marateyn.Translation: If no, move it (Shake it) twice. *** *** ***233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"8.

Moutaba’aa means continued. Literarily, it means followed by. It refers tothe “constant changing of people’s decisions and courses of action,” asexplained by Allamah Al Nabati.Tasiir appeared in both Arabic and Persian Rouhaniyaat, but wasinterpreted differently for unknown reasons.It is usually used in spirits and entities summoning séances.234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":" Both black magic and white magic made use of the Tasiir Daa-iratmoutaba’aa to influence people, and make them do whatever the Saherwishes or requests.

Andeverything also depends on who has been summoned.Are they Angels?Demons?Afarit?Or souls trapped in the doomed zone?” In the old days, it was used by the Sahiriin in Baghdad, Mosul, Damascus,and many parts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to influence judges and rulers.Many have claimed they were set free and/or acquitted, because a Saheropened up for them the magical circle of Tasiir.This technique was banned by Prophet Mohammad, and later on by hiscompanions.And Fatwahs were issued against all seers and magicians who havepracticed Tasiir. *** *** *** How to use it.Follow these instructions:1.

The preparation and use of the grids _________________ I. Synopsis of the concept:Humans follow certain calendars.The most common one is the Gregorian Calendar, which is a reflection ofthe Christian faith. It is younger than the Muslim calendar, which in turn, isyounger than the Jewish calendar. All of these are considerably younger thanthe Ulema and the Rouhaniyiin calendar, which is the only one used by theRouhaniyiin and Ulema.The Enlightened Masters reject the idea that the week consists of sevendays.Their week consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of ourweek.These are the only days to use in this technique, and the other three days inour week should not be considered. 280"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"II. The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin days are: Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday)Day 2: Araba (Wednesday)Day 3: Jema (Friday)Day 4: Saba (Saturday). The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and thehours in each day. Using the calendar of the Rouhaniyiin and Ulema, eachperson can find the luckiest hour of his or her week, according to the Bookof Ramadosh (Rama-Dosh). Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week is notsufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at work ifit occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday.This predicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique,Time Manipulation, on that exact hour.The time that will be added to your life under such circumstances will be aslucky as the original hour, and your chances of success will be vastlyimproved.”The Rouhaniyiin and Ulema teachers highly recommend performing acombination of techniques, since each enhances the other considerably. *** *** *** III. The calendars’ grids:A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, doall people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour?Yes, indeed they would.There are only sixteen grid lines to represent millions of people each. Andthis leads to an interesting discovery.The numbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony thatexists between them.For example, if you wish to approach someone in high places for a favor,then, finding that he or she shares with you the same number of letters andthe same lucky hour(s) will enhance your chances in getting that favor.Thus, you should always send your request to him or to her during the luckyhour, either by calling on the phone, using your e-mail, or placing a writtenletter in the mailbox. 281"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"*** *** *** IV. The use of a language:Another question is the issue of languages.What if your name is written with four letters in America, or where youlive, but with five letters in your native language? The answer is simple.Always use your native language. It will be much more accurate andcertainly more powerful. An important fact to add is that this technique issimple, but it can be enhanced in many ways by subtle variations.Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space isrelated to luck and success, and how to fine tune the process.But even in this straightforward version, the technique is incrediblypowerful, so much so that it may change your life completely, always for thebetter. Tip: If any added numbers are higher than one digit, always add the numbersand use the result. For example, if instead of 3+1+1+1= 6 you will findyourself with, say, 4+7+7+7=25, add 2+5 and use the result, namely 7.If you have 40+41+42+43=126, add 1+2+6=9. *** *** ***282"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"V.

During those years (Called Mah’Zu-Zah”) the doors of luck, fortune anddevelopment at many levels will open up, and opportunities forextraordinary success shall be freely given to us.This is how the phrase “17 Lucky Years of Your Life” came to exist. Andfor the period of 17 years, there is a calendar, well structured and dividedin a sequence of 77 by 7.This brings us to the Anunnaki-Ulema magical-esoteric number of 777,considered to be the Alpha and Omega of all knowledge and “Tana-Wur”(Enlightenment), similar to the Bodhisattva.At one point during the lucky years, a person will acquire two extraordinaryfaculties:1- Rou’h Ya (Prohetic Visions)2- Firasa (Reading People, just by looking at their faces). These two faculties will positively influence your life and guide youeffortlessly toward reaching the highest level of mental and physicalstrength, as well success in business and varied endeavors. Some of these endeavors for instance, is an astonishing power or capabilityof producing, writing or composing in an exceptional prolific and fastmanner.334"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"It also encompass the ability of learning many languages in no time, andreading manuscripts written in secret languages, such as the first secret andhidden alphabet (Characters) of the Hindu language.Applied in modern times, reading the secret symbols and alphabets becomeforecasting events and predicting the rise and fall of world’s markets.It was also said, that this 17 year period can alter a DNA sequence, thuspreventing time from succumbing the blessed one to aging, and thedeterioration of their cells. One of the last Mounawirin (Enlightened) known to have discovered thesecret of the 17 lucky years was Alan Cardec “Allan Cardec” (October 3,1804- March 31, 1869). Cardec’s real name was Hippolyte Léon DenizardRivail.And his Ulema name was Asha-Kar-Da-Ki. His mentor was the legendaryJohann Heinrich Pestalozzi, also knows as “Mirdach Kadoshi Sirah” in theAnunnaki-Ulema circle.His incarnated guiding master (Second high level of Anunnaki-Ulema) wasAl Zafiru, called Sefiro or Zefiro in mediumship and spiritism literature.In fact, the word or term “Spiritism” was coined by Cardec.He was the first to use it and explain its application during a contact with ahigher entity and other rapports with dead people (Trapped deceasedpersons) who asked for his help. Sometimes, it was the way around; Cardecasked for their guidance on matter related to life after death, and the realmof the next life. Cardec was the father of the French movement of Spiritism, andcommunications with entities trapped between the next dimension andEarth’s boundaries.They are called “Les retenus”, meaning those who were trapped in theafterlife dimension, or more precisely, those who were detained.Cardec was burried at the historical French cemetry Cimetiere du PereLachaise.

And as aresult, the daughter in-law begins to gain weight considerably for noapparent reasons, while the son in-law starts to lose weight considerably inan alarming manner.To prevent these metaphysical apparitions from occurring in the presentand/or in the future, the person concerned must use the A’afiza technique andpertinent Talaabat or Istijabaat, which briefly consists of placing two smallstones on a white blank paper; a small black stone on the left side of thepaper, and a white stone on the right side of the paper, separated by a thinline drawn exactly in the center of the paper.

A’atee: Give (As an order or a command). A very common word used by aTaaleb during a séance, and addressed to an entity, except the category ofangels, for angels can’t be ordered by humans.The angels are considered by Sahiriin as superior to human beings, and acategory placed between God and the “Rank of Humans.” A’atee is used,when the Saher (Sorcerer) or the practitioner commands an entity to grantany kind of favors, a temporary relief, or make things happen. Aatiliin: They are the “Devious Spirits”, who respond only to black magic,and are usually summoned to hurt others. A’shasha: A screen. In some particular séances, A’shasha was used as aSihr’s tool to project physical manifestation of summoned spirits.The screen is a quasi-holographic projection which makes entitiesmaterialize their essence during a séance.In the Western Hemisphere, and especially in the United States and GreatBritain, spirits’ physical manifestation is commonly called ectoplasma bysome practitioners. In the East, the Sahiriin refer to a spirit’s physicalmanifestation as Houdoor, which means presence in the flesh. Evidently, weare talking here about the physical presence of a Djinn or an Afrit, and notthe body of a dead human being. And this defines the thin line between realmanifestation of an entity and a hoax. No medium on the planet can bring back to life or to a séance, the body of adead person, not even partially.

When thespirit runs out of energy, it dissipates suddenly.Some Eastern practitioners compared it to an instrument which runs onbatteries, such as a flashlight.When the batteries are fully charged, the light’s projection is quite intense.When the batteries began to weaken, the light becomes dimmer and weaker.The spirit of the decease functions on the same principle.Nor the Saher or the Taaleb can recharge the “Batteries” of the manifestedspirit (soul) of a dead person, when it starts to weaken, and consequently,the spirit departs suddenly.However on A’shasha kahraba (TV’s screen for instance), the spirit couldlast much longer, for it recharges itself via electricity.Some of the Ulema and Sahiriin’s techniques could/would allow thepractitioner to communicate with spirits via their electronic gadgets,television sets, and computers’ screens.Aabaad: Syriac/Assyrian/Akkadian/Aramaic/Chaldean.Noun.

Tay Al Ard isessentially a metaphysical experience that produces a teleportationphenomenon; a secret esoteric practice of the Sihr of Ulema and Allamah.When Islam became a major religion in the Near East, and the Middle East,Tay Al Ard was banned by Prophet Muhammad, who called its practitioners“Min Ahl Al Nar”, meaning verbatim: Those who are from fire.Fire meant hell, or the kingdom of Al Shaytan (Satan, the devil).The Arabic pre-Islamic word Ulema was replaced by the Arabic Islamicword Allamah or Ulema’ah.However, the Ulema and the Allamah were very different from each other inmany ways.The Ulema remained the custodians of the Anunnaki’s secret knowledge andesoteric powers, while the Allamah were considered as the “Alamin”, thelearned ones and leading figures of letters, literature, science and religion.Nevertheless, many Muslim teachers and spiritualists remain Ulema atheart.Many - secretly of course - joined the circle of the non-Muslim Ulema tolearn the ultimate knowledge acquired from non-terrestrial beings. The Suphists were the first to join the Non-Muslim Ulema.Worth mentioning, that around, 850 A.D., Ulema and Allamah weresemantically overlapping each other. And both words came to mean orexpress the same thing – in the eye of Arab scholars – in the Islamic andArab world.Many Soufiyyin (Sufis) by joining the Ulema learned some of the secrets ofTay Al-Ard. They called it: “Tay Al Makan”, meaning the folding of space.It is composed of two Arabic words:a-Tay, which means folding or to fold;b-Al Makan, which means a space, a location. The Sufis replaced the word Al Makan with the word Al Ard. The generalmeaning of Tay Al Ard or Tay Al Makan is to traverse the earth withoutmoving. Al Munawarin claim that instead of physically moving from oneplace to another, an enlightened person can bring to himself, to where he isstanding, the place he wanted to reach. In other words, the earth of the placeto reach has been displaced under the enlightened one’s feet.Ironically, this pre-Islamic concept is now fully accepted by Muslim clerks,Cheiks and teachers of the Islamic Shari’a and Fuk’h, grouped togetherunder the umbrella of Al Allamah. 357"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Ulema Qadhi, previously one of the leading figures of Allameh Tabatabaeiexplained Tay Al Ard as the termination of matter itself in the originallocation, and its re-appearance, manifestation, and re-creation in its finallocation, the place one wished to reach.The Iranian Dehkhoda dictionary defined Tay Al Ard as: “An aspect ofKeramat “Kiramat” (Extraordinary deeds of saints and holy people) inwhich instead of going toward a destination by taking a step forward, theearth turns itself toward the traverser rapidly, in a blink of an eye,regardless of how far the destination is.\" Ulema Ibn Al Nadim bin Ishaq al-Nadim (a.k.a. Al Warrak died onSeptember 17, 995. He wrote the Kitab al-Fihrist) explained thisphenomenon by citing verses from the Quran, taken from Chapter Al Naml;Verse: 27:38: Solomon said to his men: “O Chiefs, which of youcan bring me the throne of Queen of Sheba before she and herenvoys come to me in submission?”Verse 27: 39: \"Said an 'Ifrit of Al Jinns: “I will bring it to theebefore thou rise from thy council. In fact, I have full power for thispurpose, and may be trusted.”Verse 27:40: “Said one who had knowledge of the Book: “I willbring it to thee within a blink of any eye!” Then when the sage Solomon saw it placed right before him, he said: “Thiswas done by the authority of God all mighty, my Lord.”Some Middle Eastern sages and teachers of religious esoteric dogmassuggested that according to these verses, the Ulema Asif ibn Al Birkhiateleported the throne of Queen Sheba almost instantaneously, in a blink of aneye.This was confirmed in a Hadith (Dialogue, a chat, or a discourse) by JaafarAl Sadiq. Esoteric Allamah explained this teleportation phenomenon very differently.They claimed that the teleportation occurred because Ulema Asif ibnBirkhia used one of the secret “Asma Al Allah Al Sab’a Al Husma.” (Oneof the seven secret names of God.)The knowledge and use of one of the secret holy and lovely names of Godallowed Ulema Asif ibn Birkhia to teleport the throne.The Ulema, students of the Anunnaki, briefly explained this phenomenon.Ulema Cheik Al Kabir said (Verbatim): “Time is represented with 2 linesnot perfectly aligned; one for you, the other for what is not you. Space is358"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"represented with two circles; one for you, the other for what is not you.If you manage to place yourself between one of the two lines and one of thetwo circles without touching the other line and the other circle, you willconquer time-space.” Basically, Tay Al Ard means folding the space:The phenomenon was explained to me by my mentor the HonorableAnunnaki Ulema Rabbi Mordachai. Here is an excerpt from a dialogue on the subject, I had with my mentor andtutor, years ago in Budapest, Hungary.-“Tay Al Ard,” said the Master, “is the metaphysical experience thatproduces a teleportation phenomenon.”-“Would I be able to do it?” I asked. I envisioned myself hopping at will toevery corner of the earth, not even bothering to pack.-Rabbi Mordachai: “Perhaps some day. It is extremely complicated andsometimes even dangerous. For the moment, I just want you to understandthe concept.”“Were did the teachings come from?”-Rabbi Mordachai: “The Ulema learned it from Rou-hi-yin, who aresupreme beings that dwell in the fifth dimension. For many years, theypracticed peacefully all over the world. When Islam came to the MiddleEast, the Prophet Muhammad banned Tay Al Ard, and many of the Ulemateachers became Allamah, prominent figures in letters, literature, science,and religion. However, not all of them renounced their Ulema identity.Those who chose to remain Ulema, remained the custodians of theAnunnakis’ secret knowledge and esoteric powers.They joined the circle of Non-Muslim Ulema and the groups shared theirknowledge. This was common particularly among the Sufis.”-“What do the words Tay Al Ard mean?” I asked.-Rabbi Mordachai: “The words mean ‘the folding of space.’ To put itsimply, you traverse the earth without moving. Instead of physically movingfrom one place to another, the enlightened persons do the exact opposite.They bring the place they want to reach to where they stand. The very earthof the place that they wanted to reach actually moves, and is placed undertheir feet.”-“Can you see the earth as it moves?”-Rabbi Mordachai: “Never. It happens in a blink of an eye, no matter howfar the destination is.”-“And only the Ulema know how to do it, Master?”359"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"-Rabbi Mordachai: “That depends how you look at it. Under other names,the phenomenon manifests itself in many other cultures. But some say that allof the great people who practiced Tay Al Ard, such as the great kingSolomon from Judea, were secret Ulema anyway. It is well known that KingSolomon moved the throne of the Queen of Sheba to his own palace so thatshe would feel at home during her visit with him. The event was recordedby both Islamic and Jewish teachings.”-“Are there any scientific explanations as to how it works?” I asked.The Master smiled. He saw I was already going in the right direction, and itpleased him.-Rabbi Mordachai: “This is a very good question,” He said. “It was oncewell put by the Ulema Cheik Al Kabir. His exact words were: Time isrepresented with two lines not perfectly aligned; one for you, the other forwhat is not you. Space is represented with two circles, one for you, theother for what is not you.If you manage to place yourself between one of the two lines and one of thetwo circles without touching the other line and the other circle, you willconquer time-space.”I considered this.-“But time is not going in two lines, Master. It goes straight from yesterdayto tomorrow, through today, in one line.”-Rabbi Mordachai: “That is what most people think, but they are wrong, andgreat thinkers understand the malleability of time and space.Sufis, Gnostics, pre-Islamic, Islamic, and Jewish scholars, all wrote aboutit. The Jewish Kabbalists, in particular, engaged themselves in the study ofTay Al Ard, but had a different name for it, in Hebrew.They called it Kefitzat Haderach, meaning, word by word, ‘the jumping ofthe road,’ but translated as the ability to jump instantaneously from oneplace to another or travel with unnatural speed. It was widely documentedby them.”-“What about modern scientists?” I asked.-Rabbi Mordachai: “Einstein discussed it in a number of his papers, and itwas a component of his General Relativity Theory, relating to the warpingof space-time enabled by the effects of gravity.”-“I read fairy tales and science fiction stories about such things,” I said.-Rabbi Mordachai: “Of course you did. Fiction writers have been using itfor many years,” said the Master. “But it is based on truth.”-“But I still don’t understand the principle of it,” I said. “How does theearth jump?”-Rabbi Mordachai: “There are many explanations,” said the Master, “none360"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"of them complete, since mysteries are sometimes only partially understood.Look at it this way. Newtonian physics, which did not allow suchoccurrences, were replaced long ago. Such things as wormholes, darkmatter, and space-time fluidity allow much more flexibility in investigatingteleportation. It is complicated.For example, Quantum physics has proven that particles, such as photonsand atoms, can appear instantaneously at a new place without travelingthrough space in any visible manner.Perhaps this phenomenon is possible by encoding information about anobject, transmitting the information to another place, and creating a copy ofthe original in the new location.”-“In this solution, then, the earth does not jump.”-Rabbi Mordachai: “This is correct. But in both explanations the physicalphenomenon is similar, as it is based on the disintegration of the atoms,those of the earth or those of the person, and their reassembly at the place ofdestination. I see no true conflict here.”-“In the stories I read, the person just wishes to go somewhere, and there hegoes,” I said.-Rabbi Mordachai: “Again, this is not a contradiction,” said the Master. “InWestern science it is now assumed that space does not have an objectivereality, and reality itself is thought of as observer-based and subjectiveentity.If so, then ideas such as traveling in space without actually physicallymoving are no longer so strange. In this way, Tay Al Ard is viewed as themanipulation of reality by the person who wishes to travel from point one topoint two in an environment that is subject to the traveler’s will.”-“And so,” I said, “the idea is everywhere, stories, science, differentcultures, and you know many people who have done it. I suppose you havedone it too.”-Rabbi Mordachai: “Yes, I have.”“Well, then,” I said, “why can’t I learn to do it right away?”-Rabbi Mordachai: “Because a child might be hurt in some of the places youmight want to jump to.If the environment is not safe, and you are even a little bit confused by it,you won’t be able to find your way out and may even be killed. Let’s waituntil you are an adult.”“Ah, well,” I said resignedly.“I guess the trip I was planning to the South Pole, to visit the penguins, mustbe postponed.”“Just a few years,” said the Master.361"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":" Arfood: I refuse.

Cats are also considered a “Psychic Conduit”by Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin.In fact, in some of their black magic Jalasaat (Séances), Sahiriin wouldbring in a cat to help sense, receive and send messages and predictions.The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions or Predictions of the Cat)was very active in ancient Egypt and the Near East.On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin strongly recommend toadopt cats, and care for them, for they could be very useful to their owners;they are capable of sensing imminent dangers, catastrophes, mishaps, andabove all, their instinctive nature leads them to warn their owners, littlechildren, and people who love them against danger.Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A cat in the house is blessing.”Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if they bother to watch, study andunderstand their behavior. Quite often, cats stare at something the human eyecan’t see. And in some instance, and for a few seconds, cats remain frozenin their attention upon looking at the unknown which seems to appear tothem in etheric forms. The Sahiriin told us that these etheric forms could be spirits, the souls ofdead people who are interested in the occupants of the house, dead littlegirls and boys who can’t realize that they are dead now, and keep on playingwith their toys and running right and left in particular parts of the house theyused to live in; in our case, the current house of the cat who is staring atthem.The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attention to the observing cat, toremain calm and patient, and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat isstaring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat, and to take notes of thereaction of the cat.This exercise of ours should not stop there. We should keep on observingour cat, and taking notes, and above all to draw a map of the places in ourhome which seem to interest the cat and/or provoke the cat to sense theunseen; a map which could include more than one place in our home andlocate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a web of openings, a sort of time-space vortices, or simply a “playground” for spirits.Baa rara kaat wa duu’aat: A set of prayers or chants to be recited to theNoble Spirits, called “Arwaah Nabila”.

If in thepast you succeeded in summoning one of them, that particular spirit willremain with you for the rest of your life. He/she becomes your protector,and your friend. The Sahiriin stated that in order to Ih’yaah (Intensify or nourish) a constantand fruitful relationship with a noble spirit, the Taaleb (You) must include inthe prayer the name of a noble spirit. This can be achieved by including thename of the spirit in your prayer.For instance, “Ayatooha Al Arwaah Nabila, ihmeemee” becomes “AlMaymoun (Name of the spirit) Ayatooha Al Rouh (Singular of Arwaah)Nabila, ihmeemee.”371"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"It is a plus, if you write down this prayer on a piece of paper –preferably alinen– and carry it with you wherever you go.b-A longer version of a prayer, as shown below.

You should know who, fromprevious experience (s).The Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin have suggested that this prayer be writtenon a small piece of paper with red ink, and protected by a piece of linen,and covered with a thin piece of leather.This prayer should be on you wherever you go; it will protect you, it willprevent danger and harm, and above all, it will open doors for you,assuming that you are a good person with good intentions. This prayer could/should also be recited before facing a difficult situation,an investigation wrongly involving you, a meeting with your employerconcerning termination of your employment, etc.Because it is very long, and difficult to memorize, you should instead carryit with you wherever you go.

Legend has it thatthose Djinn and Afarit are the custodians and guardians of the Book ofRamadosh. Baada bakra (Baa’dah Bakrah): Translated verbatim: After tomorrow.The Sih’r meaning: 40 days. It refers to the 40 day period after the death ofa person. This period is very critical in spiritism and Sih’r’s study becausemediums can contact the dead only during this very precise period.On the 41st day, the spirit of the deceased (Soul to others) departs to anotherdimension, if the dead person has decided to do so. This happens when adead person realizes that he/she is no longer among the “Living”, for manydead people become confused after death and don’t know what it ishappening to them. Once the mind of the dead person understands that he/she has left Earth forgood, and is currently a dead person, his/her mind offers him/her twopossibilities:First possibility: To accept this fact and moves on to a higher dimension, orto another dimension.Second possibility: To remain in this state of nothingness and to wanderforever, because the deceased is either confused, unwilling to accept thefact that he/she is dead, or simply because he/she remains deeply attached tothe physical world (Earth) he/she lived in. Since time stops to progress in the afterlife, and since there are no moredays, no more weeks, no more months, and no more years to count, thecalendar of dead people freezes immediately on the following day of theirdeath; this is why and how we got the expression “After tomorrow” Baadabkara, meaning the next day (After tomorrow) following our death. After ourdeath we age only by one day!In the afterlife, people stop to age and stop to feel pain, however, some ofthem retain some sort of space-time memory; an etheric memory.This spatial memory retains some images and feelings, a dead person hasexperienced when he/she was still alive. And those images and feelings378"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"remain very dear and extremely important to him/her, and make him/herdeeply attached to physical values and substances. Some Sahiriin use this“Physical Attachment” as a tool, or as a conduit to communicate with thedead. The Sahiriin, Rouhaniyiin, and especially the group of the Anunnaki-Ulemahave developed a technique to contact dead persons, or more precisely toremain in touch with them. This technique is called “Baada bakra ittisaal”.To them, there is no reason at all to lose touch with the departed ones.

Hesymbolized the renewal and revival of the earth's vegetation each spring. His name derived from Ba’al, and the Anunnaki word “Ba-El”, meaning thechief lord, and an \"owner\". The term lord meant the lord of the land. Histemple in Nippur was called E-Kur. He was mentioned in the Bible, inExodus and was called Ba’al-Tsephon, (Baal zephon) meaning the god ofthe crypt.The worship of Ba’al was introduced into Israel by Ahab, the king of Tyre,in Phoenicia, and his wife, Princess Jezebel.Jezebel was of an Anunnaki’s offspring. In the Bible, Baal is also calledBaalzebub, considered by the early Hebrews as one of the fallen angels.Ulema Govinda explained that the “Fallen Angels” were in fact, a categoryof the early Anunnaki who rebelled against Anu and Baalshamroot, andwere not the angels of Satan.The Eastern lightworkers summon Baal to ask his help in protectinghabitats, as well as in building immense shrines and altars.

Baal of Mount Sapan (Baal-Zaphon) in NorthernSyria, was the equivalent of the Amorite god Adad (Hadad), and one of themost important deities of the Canaanites.The early Hebrews (Habiru and Israelites) worshiped him as their own god,until their prophets waged a “hysterical” war against him, and against all thePhoenician gods (Lebanon, Syria and the rest of the Canaanite lands). Baalbecame associated with deities from several parts/regions of the Near East,such as Baal Hazor in Palestine, Baal-Sidon and Baal of Tyre (Melkart) inPhoenicia (Modern day Lebanon.)Worth mentioning here, that King Solomon has officially worshiped Baal,since he was introduced to the Israelites’ land by the Phoenician princessJezebel and Hiram.Jezebel was the daughter of Ethbaal, the King of Tyre (Modern day Sour,South of Lebanon) in Phoenicia (Modern day Lebanon), and the wife of380"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"King Ahab.

After that, the deceased dissipates, and nofurther attempts to establish contact are made.In another passage of the Book of Ramadosh, we read (Verbatim):“Although, it is impossible to reach the deceased one as soon as he/sheleaves the body, and/or during the Arba’iin (The 40 days period followinghis or her death), sometimes, if we are lucky, and/or were extremelyattached to the person we lost, a short contact with him or with her is stillpossible if we pay attention to unusual things happening around us; thoseunusual things are difficult to notice, unless we pay a great attention. Theyhappen only once, sometimes twice, but this is very rare.” The bookprovides techniques and methods pertaining to all forms and means of suchcontact. 403"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Ekimu: Name of a fallen angel.Same word and same meaning in Chaldean.Ekimu is one of the Anunnaki Sinhars who fathered sons of Man by marryingone of the Earth-Link women who lived quarantined in the “Shabha Ardi”,the isolated region in the Middle East, inaccessible to human beings.

The term “Fallen Angels” is a product of Biblical scribes, and the early Hebrews. Ulema Bukhtiar said, “The FallenAngels were Anunnaki warriors who lost their status, because they havedisobeyed the Anunnaki Council, by mating with women from Earth. Their offspring were also giants and extremely resourceful. They producedhalf Anunnaki-half human breed.

F Fabir “Fa-Birim”: Name of a female “Primordial Angel”, created by theAnunnaki who manifested herself to Ulema in a lodge’s meeting in AdisAbaba, Ethiopia; it was during a 1340’s reunion of Mounawariin(Enlightened Ones) to discuss the prime elements in the universe. AngelFabir revealed information about metals’ transmutation, and the three phasesof materialization-dematerialization of living forms in the Dounia“Universe.” In an Anunnaki Ulema’s case, the materialization-dematerialization is referred to as shape shifting. Later on, in history, theKabbalists and the Theosophists will develop the concept of “PartzupheemFaces” based upon this belief. Falak: The universe. Same word in Arabic. Falak Kitbah: Akashic Records. Falta: Escape. Faltaaniin: Entities/spirits who run free, and/or spirits who have escaped.In other words, spirits out of control, and who are not contained.

The Anunnaki and theAnunnaki-Ulema substitute the “Soul” with the “Mind”, while the soul inPersian philosophy and literature, as well as in other religious beliefs, is thesource of energy and life. Worth mentioning here, that Buddhism believes inthe Anunnaki-Ulema concept of the “Mind”.b-A divine winged disk that protects kings and rulers.Basically, the wing was one of the symbols/logos of the Anunnaki, and itappears in numerous literatures and mythologies of the ancient world.

Fath: Opening up the pockets of Zaman /Time. Fatihah: The opening or the beginning of a séance. Fik’r: The primordial source of life for our physical body.Some have depicted it as the primordial source of energy that makes thebody function and maintain its equilibrium.The Anunnaki did not create “Souls” in the human body, but a primordialenergy called “Fikr”. And this energy can last for thousands of years iftrapped in a zone called “Bilaya”, which means the “Doomed Zone.”This energy is what defines the substance of dead people in the afterlife.The Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin are known for their ability of contacting thissubstance. Fik’r and Double: Fik’r is the ability of reading future events and others’thoughts.Derived from the Anakh words Fik-R’r, and Fik.Ra.Sa. The esoteric Arabicword “Firasa” is derived from Fik.Ra.Sa.

It was through thesoul that mortals could and would hope to continue to live after death. Soulas an element or a substance does not exist anywhere inside the human body.Instead, there is a non-physical substance called “Fik’r” that makes thebrain function, and it is the brain that keeps the body working, not the soul.The “Fik’r” was the primordial element used by the Anunnaki at the timethey created the final form of the human race.Fik’r was not used in the early seven prototypes of the creation of mankindaccording to the Sumerian texts. Although the “Fik’r” is the primordialsource of life for our physical body, it is not to be considered as DNA,because DNA is a part of “Fik’r”; DNA is the physical description of ourgenes, a sort of a series of formulae, numbers and sequences of what therein our body, the data and history of our genes, genetic origin, ethnicity, race,so on.Thus Fik’r includes DNA. The Honorable Ulema said: “Consider Fik’r as a cosmic-sub-atomic-intellectual-extraterrestrial (Meaning non-physical, non-earthly) depot of all what itconstituted, constitutes and shall continue to constitute everything about you.And it is infinitesimally small.However, it can expand to an unimaginable dimension, size and proportions.It stays alive and continues to grow after we pass away, if it is still linked tothe origin of its creation, in our case the Anunnaki.The Fik’r is linked to our creators the Anunnaki through a “Conduit” foundin the cells of the brain.For now, consider Fik’r as a small molecule, a bubble. After death, thisbubble leaves the body. In fact, the body dies as soon as the bubble leavesthe body.The body dies because the bubble leaves the body.Immediately, with one tenth of one million of a second, the molecule or thebubble frees itself from any and everything physical, including theatmosphere, the air, and the light; absolutely everything we can measure, andeverything related to Earth, including its orbit.The molecule does not go before St. Paul, St. Peter or God to standjudgment and await the decision of God -whether you have to go to heavenor hell– because there is no hell and there is no heaven the way we412"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"understand hell and heaven.

Anzalubirach is anAna’kh/Ulemite term meaning the following:a-Collecting thoughts, receiving and sending multiple mental images viabrain wave synchronization, to improve mental and physical health;b-Using mental energy to move or teleport things. This is one of the phasesand practices of Tarkiz.Tarkiz means a deep mental or intellectual concentration that producestelekinesis and teleportation phenomena.Sahiriin and Ulema’s students learn this technique in various forms.Basically it works like this:a-The students use their Conduit (Which is located in the brain’s cells) tocontrol the waves of their brains (First level of learning).b-The students concentrate on an object hidden behind a screen or a dividermade from thin rice paper. (Second level of learning).By synchronizing the frequency of their Conduit and an absolute state ofintrospection, the students attempt to move the hidden object from one placeto another without even touching it.c-In a more advanced stage, the students attempt to alter the properties of theobject by lowering or increasing the frequencies and vibrations of the objectitself. The brain is constantly producing different types of frequencies, waves, andvibrations, and transmitting messages reflecting our mental activity, feelings,thoughts, and state of consciousness or mind. Thus, the brain waves aredivided in four states or categories called:1-Beta,2-Alpha,3-Theta,4-Delta. In addition to Betha, Alpha, Theta, and Delta waves, the Anunnaki Ulemadeveloped a sixth wave called Fikr-Rama.It is neither measurable nor detectable, because it does notemanate from the physical brain.

Another striking example is the figure of the Biblical Melchizedek thatappeared on a façade of the Cathedral de Chartre in France, holding achalice in the shape of a mushroom, symbolizing life, and perhaps the HolyGrail, as interpreted in the literature of the Cathars, the Knights Templar,and many enlightened eastern secret societies.It was also interpreted as the “Divine-Human Vessel”, meaning the womb ofVirgin Mary; the very womb that gave birth to Jesus.In ancient Phoenician and Akkadian traditions closely related to theAnunnaki, the mushroom as a chalice represents the creative power of thefemale.More precisely, the fecundity of a female Anunnaki goddess, giver of lifeand all living creatures. This fecundity source came in the form of amitochondrial DNA. The secret extracted liquid of the mushroomrepresented the “Light Liquid” known also as Elixir of Life, often called inthe ancient Middle East as the “Shiraab al Sahiriin” (Juice or Syrup of thesorcerers and lightworkers).Like the Zaafaran, the Shiraab was used by Sahiriin and NobleLightworkers to write magical talismans, and the secret powerful names ofthe Supreme Beings on the Burqah, and inside the “Magical Square”.By using the invisible light liquid, only the spirit could read the Talabaatand the Istibabaat, and thus communicating with spirits, angels and entitieswas channeled through magical words and sentences invisible to the nakedeyes.On many Templars’ pillars and Bourj (Upper part of a medieval fortress ora castle) in Syria, Malta and Lebanon, the mushroom is carefully illustratedas a “Flower of Life” known to the Phoenicians, Habiru (Hebrew), earlyArabs, Sumerians and Anunnaki as:a-Wardah,b-Ward,c-Vardeh.419"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"These three words (Meaning a rose, or a flower) in ancient linguisticcontext, symbolized the blooming of life, and the flux of supernatural power.At one point in history, the mushroom’s figure was used by the Templiers deSaint Jean (Templar Order of St. John of Malta) as the symbol of the HolyGrail.And in other passages, the mushroom represented a head; the head of aSinhar “A leader”, or an enlightened lightworker.Some historians thought that the leader was Baphomet, while othersbelieved it was Noah, and another group believed it was the ProphetMohammed, and finally, there is a group of learned masters who claimedthat is was the Khalek of Markabah.Khalek is one of the seventy two names/attributes of God in Arabic (Now,99), and Markabah or Merkabah means a chariot in Sumerian and Akkadian.Mercavah in Hebrew, and Markaba in Arabic.The secret esoteric meaning of the word Markabah is this: The EnlightenedMasters (Nouraniyiin), the Sahiriin, and Noble Lightworkers reach theHigher Dimmension (Sphere of the noble spirits) through a chariot madefrom light. Firasa or “Firasa-Basira”: Usually associated with Basira. Literally,Firasa means perception, intelligence, supernatural powers, mediumship,evidence, and insight, used by Middle Eastern and Near Easternlightworkers. In addition, it is understood and depicted as having a thirdeye, deep perception, an ability to see consequences just at the beginning ofan act, or foresight.Firasa and the paranormal: Almost all rulers in ancient Persia,Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, and later in Egypt employed in their royal courts,“People of Firasa”.They consulted with them during visits of dignitaries and officials fromforeign countries. It was the secret science of learning about the personalityof people through the study of physiognomy, guided by a noble spirit. Thisscience was called “Firasa”.One of the greatest Ulema masters and lightworkers (Sahiriin) and expertsin the field was Fakher Addiin Al Razi. His noted treatise on Firasa “TheScience of Psycho-physiognomy” was inspired by the teachings of the eldernon-physical Ulema. In the unpublished original edition of his treatise,several MysticUlema, Sahiriin, Mouwariin, and magic-lightworkers (Psychics, mediums)syllables and geometric forms were included in “Al Moukamma”, theintroduction of the book dedicated to the “True believers of the higher420"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"knowledge”.

When your departed loved pet returns to see youIV. Excerpts from Master Li’s Kira’at on Gensi-uzuru ____________________ I. Introduction:Gensi-uzuruis is associated with apparition of dead pets, and ourcommunication with them during a very specific time period.The Ulema are very fond of animals. Extensive passages in the Book ofRama-Dosh speak about the important role animals play in the life ofhumans, especially at emotional and therapeutic levels.The Ulema believe that pets understand very well their human-friends(Instead of using the word “owners”). And also, pets communicate withthose who show them love and affection.This loving relationship between pets and their human-friends does not endwhen pets die. II. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets?Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility ofcontacting deceased people or animals, they have explained to us thatcontacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, and onlyduring the 40 days period following their death.424"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"In other words, we can contact our deceased parents and dear ones, ormore accurately enter in contact with them if:a-They contact us short after their death;b-They must initiate the contact;c-This should happen during a 40 days period following theirdeparture;d-Their contact (Physical or non-physical) must be noticed by us.This means that we should and must pay an extra attention to“something” quite irregular or unusual happening around us.Because our departed pets will try to send us messages, and inmany instances, they do.e-We must expect their messages, and strongly believe in thosemessages. The Ulema said that humans cannot contact their dead pets. But pets cancontact us via different ways, that we can sense if we have developed astrong bond with them. Pets know who love them and those who don’t,because pets feel, understand, sense and see our aura.All our feelings and thoughts are imprinted in our aura, and the aura iseasily visible to pets, particularly, cats, dogs, parrots, lionesses, pigs, andhorses. This belief is shared by authors, people of science and therapists inthe West, despite major difference between Westerners and Ulema indefining the nature and limits of pets-humans after death contact. III. When your departed loved pet returns to see you:I remember very vividly what the loving and Honorable Ulema Li has saidto a novice who rushed to him in tears, and begged him to bring back to life,his dog who had died that morning.This happened some sixty years ago. Here is the story.My loving teacher asked the little Murad (Name of the novice):When did your dog die?Murad: This morning Master, please bring him back to me!Master Li: I can’t do that son, but how about if I let you see him one moretime?Murad: Oh Master, I will do anything for you, anything.Master Li: You know son, you dog is not dead. He is somewhere else nowand he is very happy.Murad: Master, I buried him this morning under the tree. He is dead, he isdead!Master Li: Ok then, l will let you see him one more time, but do not touch425"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"him, do you understand? Just look at him, you can talk to him, but do nottouch him. If you touch him, Poof, he will disappear.Note: By then, many students were alerted to what was going on and rushedto sit on the floor at the feet of the Master, excited and curious, they keptlooking at the Master and I could hear them saying Master, please one moremiracle, because they were accustomed to see the Master doingextraordinary things. An indescribable deep silence threw its heavy coatover the little students... and we were waiting...And all of a sudden, Murad screamed: Ahhhh...he is scratching my legs...heis licking my right foot...he is here...I feel him...Where is Master? Whereis he, please tell me...I want to see him.None of the students –including myself– saw or felt anything. Only Murad.Then, a thin layer of white dust began to take shape. And suddenly the dustwas transformed into a substance like fluffy white cotton, and finally theface of a small dog began to appear, and seconds later, his whole bodybecame visible to all of us.Murad got so excited and so happy...and not remembering what the Masterhas told him, rushed to hug his dog. And this was a grave mistake.Because as soon as he touched the face of his dog, the dog vanished in thinair.What Murad did upset everybody, and we hated him for that!Obviously Murad is in state of shock now. He did not know what to do orwhat to say. He dropped on the ground, and almost fell in a coma. The dognever returned again.With an austere serenity, the Master was watching everything, andeverybody.Then, almost in a perfect synchronization, the students shouted: Master!What happened?And very calmly, the Master said: “You never touch the body of the deadbefore he rises to a higher dimension.” None of us understood what hemeant. We kept on asking more and more questions, but the Master in a firm voicesaid: “The Dirasa did not start yet!” (Dirasa means the lesson or the study.)Two months later, the Master nicely surprised us with a lesson on Gensi-uzuru. Obviously, he did not forget how interested we were in learning moreabout what has happened to Murad’s dog. Everybody was excited beyondbelief. And this is what the Master had to say: IV.

They do not consider them animals, but friends whojust look different.You too, all of you, should love and care for you pets.Your pets feel with you, and know if you love them or you don’t.Your pets can even protect your health and some other time, I willtell you more about it.When your pets die, they don’t forget you. Like all of us, theyremember their good friends.And believe me when I tell you, they will try to come back,because they want so much to be with you again. Unfortunately, thisis not possible.However, and because of the great love you had for your pets, theywill keep on trying and trying.Pets are like humans...after they die, they don’t understand what ishappening to them.They become very confused.But this happens to your pets during two weeks only. The twoweeks after they have died. After these two weeks, their essence isno longer trapped in the thin sphere separating Earth (More exactly,previous life) from the next dimension. So after two weeks, theyare gone for good.For humans, it is 40 days. After 40 days, we are no longer here. Weenter the next dimension, and we never come back.So, during these two weeks (Two weeks after they die), your petscan return to see you for a very very short moment. It could last upto 4 seconds.Now, it is up to you to feel their presence. It is not difficult if youpay attention.I am going to explain to you.First, what they do is this: Because they are no longer in a physicalsubstance,(Physical form), and because they don’t know what ishappening them, they approach you very slowly. They areconfused, but they recognize you.They still remember where they were before.They remember your home, you, and the toys they played with; theones you gave them.So, they come toward you slowly slowly, and gently will leanagainst your legs, or touch your legs like a whisper, like a child’scaress.427"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"Unfortunately, very very very few people notice that. And sadlyenough, your pets’ desperate efforts to contact you and let youknow that they here around you are almost never felt.So, they dissipate, because they run out of energy.Remember, they can’t last for more than 4 seconds.But they don’t give up. They will try one more time. Only one moretime. After that, they are gone for ever.Now listen to me carefully. While you are not aware of theirinvisible existence around you, things are still happening, and youcan be part of it.You can still make some small arrangements, and mentally andemotionally prepare yourself to feel them when they return. Andyou will succeed. So what you have to do is this:Go fetch their toys. All of them if possible. Put them in theirfavorite area, where they used to play with their toys or preferredto lay down.Sit on the floor around the toys. Remember, you can’t call yourdead pets. You can’t communicate with them.But they will communicate with you and will return to see you forthe last time.Bring their food and water bowls, and put them next to their toys,as if they were still alive. Don’t ask why, just do it.Stay there for sometime. Twenty minutes should suffice. You canleave the room, but it is imperative that every ten minutes you goback, and sit there for few more minutes.Keep on doing this for two days. Is it time consuming? Not really,if you want to see your pets again.And before you know it, they will come back, and they will rubagainst you, and you are going to feel it, and you will never everforget that feeling.This would be their farewell to you...

His followers loved him so much they called him \"TheExalted One.\"Even to a holy man, or a great mystic, creating life is forbidden. It can onlybe justified if many lives would be saved by doing so, and not always eventhen. But Rabbi Loeb was instructed to try the horrifying task.

His son-in-law, a Kohen (a Jewdescended from the ancient order of priests) and his pupil, a Levite (a Jewdescended from the servants of the Temple). He explained that they neededfour elements -- fire, water, air and earth.The two assistants represented the fire and water, Rabbi Loeb, air, and theGolem, earth.He explained how they had to purify themselves, because unless they werecompletely ready, the Shem Hameforash would destroy them.After a day of purification, they read various chapters from a particularlyholy book, Sefer Yezira (The Book of Creation) and then went to the RiverMoldau.By torchlight, they sculpted a giant body out of river clay. The Golem laybefore them, facing the heaven. They placed themselves at his feet, lookingat the quiet face.The Kohen walked seven times around the body, from right to left, recitingspecial Zirufim. The clay turned bright red, like fire.Then the Levite walked another seven times around the body, from left toright, reciting some more Zirufim.

But this is not limitedonly to animals.Children (when they are little) can also sense and see these entities; in fact,children enjoy watching these entities and conversing with them. Parentsshould not discourage or punish their children when they tell them storiesabout ghosts and “invisible friends”.We can learn a lot from pets and children, just by watching how they react inthe presence of these entities, and by taking notes.At the beginning, this would not make sense to many of us, but if we takenotes, if we are patient, and we start to compare these notes followingseveral events, our mind will open up, and a part of our “Conduit” will beactivated. These entities are not the product of the imagination of a child. They doexist in multiple etheric and even plasmic forms. But our eyes, moreprecisely our brain is unable to perceive them.

Andeach vibration occupies a spot in your Araya, called “Jaba”.Let’s simply things and call Araya now a net. This net has many holes,called “Jabas”. Each Jaba (A hole, so to speak) stores one idea. And eachidea or thought in the Jaba of the net produces a vibration. For example, ifthe net has 70,000 Jabas, your brain will be able to store 70,000 ideas andthoughts.This means, that your Araya hosts 70,000 vibrations. And that is fullcapacity.

Only bad thoughts, and bad ideas, suchas fear, low self-esteem, stubbornness, hate, indecisiveness, laziness,tendency toward violence, badmouthing people, envy, jealousy, betrayal, soon, emit vibrations that overflow the perimeter (Circumference) of the Jaba(Hole or location) that stores your thought or idea. This phenomenon (Overflow) takes over the adjacent Jaba(s) containing agood idea or a good thought. Because the negative energy inside your mindis usually stronger than the positive energy of a good thought, the Jaba on thenet (Location) containing a good thought or a good idea shrinks, getscontaminated, and stops to emit positive and creative energy.This, kills the good thoughts and good ideas in your Araya. If this continues,all good and creative ideas and thoughts in your brain will be damaged andneutralized by your bad thoughts and ideas.

They are governed by the laws of physics thatdefine and regulate the nature, substance and functions of ourplanet.However, the mind can escape from the earthy bondage and earth’sphysical frontiers, and enter different dimensions.The ultimate guide for that journey is the astral body. In the past,we called it the double. In this particular situation, it is wiser tocall it your guide, because during your journey to the other world -not afterlife yet - your physical body will remain on earth, andthere is no body per se to refer to.No physical substance can enter non-physical sphere.No human voice can reach the ear of non-physical entities.No human voice or any sound produced on earth is heard in otherdimensions.However, your guide (Your Double) carries within itselfeverything that constitutes your physical body, including memory,thoughts and introspection. But not physical sensations andcorporal feelings.While your physical body is still quite alive but dormant in thephysical surroundings (It could be your home, your office, your car,etc.), your Double retains all the faculties your brain and bodyreceived at the moment of your birth.Of course, your knowledge will increase considerably throughoutthe ages as you enter school, universities, and as you begin to learnfrom your teachers and tutors. We call this kind of knowledge“Earth’s Knowledge”.What you did not know is, that your “Conduit” which is located inthe cells of your brains contains an enormous amount of knowledgeyou did not tap in yet, because you were not aware of its existence,or because you have never believed in the existence of your“Conduit”.464"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The Conduit consists of ultra-microscopically small tissues andmembranes in your brain’s cells.

It will stay where it is,only your “Other Self” will change.Once, your Conduit is activated - better to say open – your mindbegins to see new things...no, you are not hallucinating at all... youare only experiencing and seeing new things, called “Rou’yah”(Visions).The very first thing you will see is absolutely nothing. It is like ifyou were looking at an empty world without buildings, cars, treesand people.For a few seconds, you will be confused. Your mind is stillworking. But your mind cannot understand yet this emptiness.In fact, it is not emptiness at all.There is no such thing as emptiness or empty space or nothingnessin the world.Everything is part of something else.Because your mind is seeing something very new, or because yourmind is seeing nothing at all, for now, that is, your mind cannotexplain to you what “Is This?” What are you experiencing?

Entering a different dimension after you have passed away:According to the Ulema, life continues after the so-called death, in differentforms and substances.Substances and after-life molecular structures vary from one person toanother, to name a few:a-Plasmicb-Ethericc-Hollographicd-Mentale-Bio-organic467"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"f-Memory organismg-Dual structure: Mental-Physical, so on. The Ulema have explained in their teachings, that human life does not end onearth. Although the physical body decays, the mind continues to live inanother dimension.The Judeo-Christian-Muslim tradition uses “soul” instead of mind.The Ulema believe that the soul is one of the many manifestations of themind, although the soul does not manifest itself in any form or shape, noteven in an etheric or ethereal sense. Buddhism also uses mind instead ofsoul. Excerpts from the readings of the Honorable Sheik Al Mutawalli, verbatim,word for word:At the very moment, your body expires (At the moment of yourdeath), your Double instantly separates itself from the spheresurrounding your body.Your Double that co-existed with you in your physical dimensionwas never physically attached to your body.In many instances, sometimes for a very long period, your“Double” has remained distant from your physical body for manyreasons. But in general, your “Double” stays very close to you.The distance separating your Double from your physical bodydepends on your health condition.It is very healthy and even necessary to keep your Double at aclose proximity of your body.Miraculous recoveries are sometimes attributed to divineintervention.Sudden recoveries are sometimes attributed to a strong will andone’s determination to be healthy again. And of course, there areother inexplicable recoveries which are attributed to otherinexplicable events and phenomena. Everything is possible. But themain reason for a sudden and inexplicable recovery is the suddenre-entry of your healthy Double in your physical body. Itreactivates and energizes everything in your body. It is likerecharging a dead battery.Your Double knows very well how your body functions, far moreand better than any physician.Because the physical condition of your body at the time yourelinquish your last breath is paramount, the passage to another468"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"dimension is henceforth influenced and altered accordingly.For example, people who die in a brutal accident or commitsuicide, their Double becomes instantly impaired and dysfunctionalat the time of their death. Suicide is wrong. No matter howmiserable is your life, you should never commit suicide.Tragic death and suicide confuse and disorient your Double.Disorienting your Double is harmful to your mind. And becauseyour mind is your vehicle to the other world, you should avoidanything or anyone that could cause you a tragic, painful andsudden death.The body has its wounds. The mind has wounds too, but you can’tsee them. Your Double does.If you leave earth in that condition, your mind will not lead youtoward the Ba’ab.You will be disoriented. If you have not caused your own death,but suffered a lot at the time of your death, and your Double wasfar away from you, your passage to the other world will not bepleasant at all. And the Ba’ab will not be open right away to allowyou to enter the other side of the world.Of course, eventually you will pass through, but not before 40tumultuous and painful days you will spend lost and confused in therealm of confusion and loneliness.In normal situation such as a death of a natural cause, the passageto the other world takes its normal course, at the end of theDouble’s self-judgment and assessment of deeds, actions andthoughts of the deceased. Kabari-Nizaam: It is composed of two words:a-Kabari, which means dimension; a sphere of existence.b-Nizaam, which means a cosmic order; a cosmic law; justice.The general meaning is one’s accountability; responsibility at the end of hisor her life on Earth. The concept; explanation: This concept was explained during an Ulema’sKiraat (Readings; lectures), and a Q&A session. During an Ulema’s reading,a student asked the teacher this question:a-What happens to a bad person when he dies and right before he reachesthe Ba’ab? (A sort of stargate; an entrance to another dimension; the otherworld; the afterlife.)The honorable teacher replied:469"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"(Note: Verbatim, word for word. Translated according to the originalreading, and preserving its authentic caché.)The “Nizam” (Cosmic Order and Law) tells us, that nobodyescapes the final judgment.Each one of us is responsible for his/her acts, deeds, thoughts, evenintentions. The principle of accountability is “Da.Em” (Perpetual).Eventually, all people will be saved at the end.There is no such thing as hell where human flesh and bones areburned by an eternal fire.Through the Ba’ab, the good person will be admitted to the graceand beauty of a higher dimension of happiness and peace. The badperson will not be allowed to enter the Ba’ab right away.When a bad person dies, he immediately faces his Double. In thisinstance, the Double acts as a conscience and as a judge.The entire life flashes before his mind as a holographic sequenceof events, deeds and thoughts. It is a large screen of his entire life.Everything he did in his life on earth is projected on this screen.Because he was a bad person, he will not be allowed to enter theMadkhal (Entrance to the other world). His double will stop himright there.He will be punished according to the gravity of his acts andthoughts. This bad person could spend thousands of years in a stateof confusion, loneliness, fear, anguish, mental pain and suffering.The mental pain is as real and as atrocious as a physical pain.There is no escape.The bad person will spend those very long years in a sphereinhabited by chaos, horrific entities and psychosomatic pain, eventhough, he does no longer possess a physical body.All the properties of his physical bodies are transferred to his mindin this new sphere , and as a result, he will suffer physicallythrough his mind.And as a punishment, he will feel the same pain and suffering hecaused to others. As I told you before, there is no physical hell inthe afterlife. But as I see it, this sort of punishment is more painfulthan burning in fire.Because his Double is partially responsible, the Double will suffertoo. Consequently, the deceased bad person will not be united withhis Double.The separation between the deceased bad person and his Doublewill last for many years, as long as it takes to rehabilitate him and470"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"purify his past deeds and thoughts.Once the rehabilitation is complete, and the bad person has beentotally purified, he unites with his Double and loses hispsychological (Psychosomatic) senses of the physical properties ofhis body.Thus the pain ceases.From the Madkhal he reaches the Ba’ab that takes him to a higherdimension; a sphere of tranquility, beauty, and eternal peace.However, this sphere is not perfect, because it is the lowest of theseven other dimensions that constitute the final and eternaldestinations of the human existence.As we progress mentally (Spiritually to others), we reach higherand higher dimensions.The highest sphere we can reach is the Six dimension.The Seventh dimension is the “Malakout” (Almost same word inHebrew, Aramaic, Phoenician, Syriac and Arabic, Ana’kh, and itmeans kingdom or paradise), where the Supreme Energy (God orthe Original Force of Creation) originated, exists, lives, andextends infinitely. Another student asked the honorable teacher this question:b-What happens to a person who is not bad, but not a very good personwhen he dies and right before he reaches the Ba’ab?The honorable teacher replied:(Note: Verbatim, word for word. Translated according to the originalreading, and preserving its authentic caché.)At the moment of death, he will be guided by his Double to aneutral sphere”where he will spend 40 days of purification.During those 40 days, he will receive guidance and orientationfrom his “Double”.Because he was not a bad person, at the end of the 40 days period,and right before going through the Ba’ab, he will be allowed torevisit the living he wishes to see one more time.Also, he will be permitted to hover over places he wishes to visitfor the last time.In some instances, the visited parents of the deceased feel his lastapparition to them.Usually, the deceased appears to them in an ethereal form.It is not totally ectoplasmic, because at that stage, the deceased hasalready lost all the physical properties of his body. So his471"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"apparition is mental holography.The apparition does not last long. It fades way within a fewseconds. And this is the last message (Sort of a Farewell), theparents will receive from him/her.After that last visit, no contact will ever occur again between thedead person and his/her loved ones. His/her mind (Soul to others)will leave earth for ever.Do not be duped by those who claim, that they can contact the deadand communicate with the spirits.Be aware of those fake spirits’ séances and channeling. Unless, themind (Soul or Spirit to others) initiates a contact during particularstages, no living being on earth can communicate with the dead.Contact with dead people is possible, if the enlightened one hasbeen granted the privilege to go through the Al Madkhal and theBa’ab.On the last day of the 40 days period, the deceased is zoomed intohis/her Double, and becomes one with his “Original Form”.The Original Form is what it created him/her. This is why we callit Double.The Double is the real persona of the human being. Everything wehave in our body and mind came from our Double.Even though, some of our mental and physical faculties andproperties are usually damaged on earth for various reasons, suchas illness, malnutrition, fear, prejudices, tortures, confusion, etc.,the original faculties in our Double are immune, because thephysical cannot affect the non-physical, nor reach any dimensionbeyond the “Zinar” (Belt of Earth).As soon as the deceased becomes one with the Double, the mindenters the Ba’ab on its way to the Fourth dimension.The Fourth dimension is a sphere so close to earth.And because the mind of the deceased in this dimension is capableof mental and spatial dilatation, quite often, the mind and theperimeter of the fourth dimension extend like an echo.It is through the extension of that echo, that contacts with the fourthdimension’s inhabitants are possible, but they are so rare. Almost,they never happen.Once, the mind (The deceased or visiting entity) enters the Fourthdimension, the deceased begins to see all sorts of things, shapes,colors, entities, human forms, spiritual forms created by his/hermemory. It is a very pleasant sphere consisting of only good472"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"sensations, a sense of tranquility and safety.From now on, we will never again feel pain, sorrow, fatigue...nomore worries, frustration and anxiety.Yet, the Fourth dimension is not a perfect dimension, even thoughwe are reunited with friends and beloved ones, even our pets, forwe have to progress and reach a higher dimension.The Fifth dimension is better and prettier. And within it, there areso many other worlds of an unimaginable beauty, and so manywonderful things to see and to do. Kaabeeh: Bad deed, awful action and awful thoughts.

Kafat Kamah: Composed of two words:473"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"a-Kafat, which means transport; reduction; distance.b-Kamah, which means the end of a journey.The general meaning is the act of materialization and/or sudden appearanceof a person or an entity in another place, and/or in multiple placessimulteanously. From Kafat Kamah, derived the Hebrew phrase and concept Kefitzat ha-Derekh.Translated literally, Kefitzat ha-Derekh means \"the jumping of the road.\"perform a valuable religious service. Suddenly, he finds himself in thatdistant spot, sometimes without realizing how it happened, sometimes bybeing transported through the air or over water. Such a miracle is assumedto be performed either by God himself, by one of his angels, or by Elijah theProphet. The other approach to kefitzat ha-derekh was accomplisheddeliberately by a group of people called “Baalei Shem.“The term means \"masters of the Name\" and the word \"baalei\" is the pluralof \"baal,\" or master.These people performed what amounts to magic, despite the fact thatJudaism had always objected to any form of it; the Bible even recommendskilling all witches. But this did not stop the practitioners of practicalKabbalah from being wonder makers. The baalei shem maintained that theyhad secret knowledge of the holy Names, and that they could achievesupernatural results using them. The Name, holy Name, or Shem Tov (good Name) may be one of the divineNames, the name of an angel, or a combination of letters in those Names.Most people familiar with Judaism know the name of the Baal Shem Tov,the founder of the Hasidism.His real name was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer. A truly great scholar, hecreated a new philosophy, functioned as a religious leader, and performedmiracles as a wonder-maker.Most of what we know about him is second hand, stories told by hisdisciples and later repeated for generations, much like Rabbi Hillel,Buddha, Socrates, and Jesus. The most famous book about him is Shivheiha-Besht (Besht is the Hebrew acronym for Baal Shem Tov), a collection ofstories that have been used in every book written about him. However, manypeople do not know that he was not the first to be the master of Names.Many of the stories in the book were borrowed from original tales aboutother \"baalei shem\" that had preceded the Baal Shem Tov.Scholars, particularly Gershom Scholem, proved that there was nodifference between the words \"baal shem\" which means, \"master of the474"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"name\" and \"Baal Shem Tov,\" which means \"master of the good name.\" Allnames were good -- the baalei shem would not use them otherwise. Theynever performed anything even remotely negative like sorcery, black magic,or Satanism; the entire purpose of the wonders they performed was positive,and based on deep faith in traditional Judaism.The Names they used could be either spoken, or written on amulets made ofpaper or parchment. Baalei shem are not mentioned in the Bible. Theyappear for the first time in the post-Talmudic period in Babylonia, orpossibly at the beginning of the Geonim period, and the tales developed intothe Middle Ages. The 16th and 17th centuries are extremely rich in stories, in both Israel andEurope. Kefitzat ha-Derekh is only one of the many wonders the “BaaleiShem” performed. They could preserve the bodies of the dead as \"dead-alive\" by placing written amulets in the bodies, to keep them for burial inthe proper time and place.They could create golems exorcize demons and dybbuks protect peopleagainst their enemies on both land and sea, summon beasts from the spiritualrealms, send and interpret dreams, and raise the spirits of the dead.Every process had its own formula and name, and those of kefitzat ha-derekh were different from all the others. The first known text to mentionkefitzat ha-derekh, coupled with the personality of a baal shem, was aquestion sent by a North African community to Rabbi Hai Gaon.It described how a famous baal shem was seen in one place on the Eve onSabbath (Friday). Later on the same Friday night, he was seen in anotherplace, a distance of a few days journey. On Saturday evening, he was againseen back in the original place.There was no logical way to interpret the sightings, and the communitywanted Rabbi Hai Gaon to explain the miracle. In his response, Rabbi HaiGaon categorically denied the possibility of kefitzat ha-derekh; mostrational rabbis did not want anything to do with these fancifulideas.However, the population, greatly encouraged by the baalei shem, didbelieve in kefitzat ha-derekh.The concept appeared in many areas of the world. Southern Italy produced aparticularly famous manuscript, Megillat Ahimaaz (also called MegillatYuhasin). In this tale a most amusing use of the formula is described -- theName was written on the hooves of the horse carrying the baal shem! Thereare tales from Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, and others. Many more areattributed to the Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria), the great kabbalist from Safed,Israel, and to his student, Rabbi Hayim Vital. These wonderful tales475"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"continued to develop until the traveling rabbis abandoned walking andriding in favor of technological progress; they started using fast ways oftransportation, such as trains, to reach important destinations.As miraculous teleportation was no longer urgently needed, the telling ofKefitzat ha-derekh tales dwindled and eventually stopped. The demise of this myth is surprising, since there are such things as derailedtrains, car accidents, and delayed planes. Why not have a miracle in acrowded airport, or while stranded on a lonely road in a stalled car?The stories might have continued to accommodate such issues, and theirorganic growth into modernity would have been of interest.However, perhaps they did not entirely vanish, after all. The idea resemblesteleportation in other world myths and legends, not to mention sciencefiction and fantasy, which freely make use of it in books, movies, andtelevision. If Kefitzat ha-derekh sounds familiar to readers of sciencefiction, it is because Frank Herbert used this term in his book “Dune”,where the concept charmingly, if somewhat inaccurately, refers to a personwhose being represents the shortening of time leading to a certain importantfuture event. But the most famous form of modern science fiction/Kefitzatha-derekh will be familiar to just about everyone: \"Beam me up, Scotty!\"-From the book “Anunnaki Who’s Who”, co-authored by M. de Lafayette and Dr. Anbel.

However,they are not permanent, meaning they appear on Earth, each time a cosmicmolecule or “Bubble” collides with another Bubble.This happens cosmically. However, the Manifestation Squares materializeon Earth, when two distinct yet very close dimension membranes “bump”into each other.Ulema Stanbouli added, “The whole universe was created in this way.”From Kama, derived the Hebrew word Kamea, which means a magicsquare.In esoterica and occult studies, Kama or Kamea are a place, or a zone usedby Kabalists and occultists to communicate with non-human entities in orderto accomplish magical acts.

So bodyguards remain anecessity. They should stay around. Only those who have learned anddeveloped esoteric Ulema techniques can use their Double as a shield. However, a novice or a sincere student who is searching for the ultimateparanormal truth, and who has revealed a high standard of spirituality andgoodness will be able to use the Double, once he/she has completed the481"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"Ulema studies.At your stage, your Double is alive and well, and is fully aware of yourexistence, but YOU are not aware of its existence, because either you do notbelieve in a Double, or you have not established a rapport with yourDouble.Once, a rapport has been established with your Double, your Conduit willthrow an invisible protective shield around you. But was it a shield? Is it aphysical barrage?A protective tool or a device similar to the fibreglass or a metal shieldpolice use in riots?The answer is no.The shield functions in so many different ways your brain cannotcomprehend. However, I will try to explain to you one of the protectivemeasures a shield uses in threatening situations.The Ulema after years of study and practice, and following the instructionsof the Book of Rama-Dosh, became capable of creating a sphere (Or zone)around them that resembles a halo. Some call this halo a “Bubble”.The halo surrounds their physical body. In the halo, exist molecules andparticles charged with high atomic and sub-atomic density (No, not nucleardevices!), i.e. energy.This energy is denser in its composition than any of the molecules andparticles that physically create and constitute any physical action ormovement against an Ulema’s body. Ulema’s energy changes constantly and transmutes itself into higher or lowermolecules/particles density, according to their surroundings andneeds.Because of the Ulema’s denser atomic substance, nothing canpenetrate the halo surrounding them.You have to remember, that everything in the universe is composed frommolecules and particles. For instance, if you throw a punch at an Ulema, youput in your punch a certain amount of energy and physical effort. The energyand the physical effort are composed from molecules.These molecules are denser in their composition than the molecules floatingaround the Ulema, and thus cannot penetrate their halo and reach theirbodies.This is why people can’t go through walls. Our bodies molecules need “toshrink” and “transmute” themselves into thinner vibrations, to allow us to gothrough walls.Secondly, the non-physical entity (Double) you have mentioned is not totallynon-physical. It changes.482"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"It materializes and dematerializes. The Double can project itself as aphysical entity.And it takes on multiple appearances ranging from holographic to multi-dimensional presences. However, the materialistic apparition does not lastvery long in a three-dimensional sphere, because its bio-etco-plasma energyis consumed rapidly.Let’s forget for a moment this complicated language, and explore an easiercharacteristic aspect of the Double, its halo, zone and protective shield. Iwill try to use a simple language, as much as I can. Disregard everything Ihave said before, and follow me now step by step.a-Your Double is extremely intelligent and alert, and it senses things aroundyou. Things currently happening and those en route.b-Your Double knows right away if what is coming at you is safe ordangerous.c-If the Double detects a threatening situation, it sends an alert to yourConduit.d-Your Conduit receives the message from your Double. (Note: Sometimes,it is simultaneously, and/or your Open Conduit understands the situation onits own, without the help of your Double.)e-Your Conduit acts on its own and guides you instantly to a safer position.Call it whatever you want, instinct, an inner feeling, etc...it does not matterwhat you call it.f-At the same time, your Conduit emits vibes aimed at the source of thethreat to bock it.g-At this very moment, your Open Conduit and your Double act in unison.h-In a fraction of a second, the attacker or the negative vibes aimed at you isdiverted.

The “White Head” isthe first Sephira, the Crown, or first active light.” IV. In the modern Egyptian Ruhaniye:Ruhaniye is a modern Egyptian word for magic that rotates around spiritsand angels séances, similar to those described in the “Testament ofSolomon”, which included the names of Anunnaki’s angels and demons,including Afrits and Djinns.

The most509"},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"common one is the Gregorian Calendar, which is a reflection of theChristian faith.It is younger than the Muslim calendar, which in turn, is younger than theJewish calendar.All of these are considerably younger than the Anunnaki calendar, which isthe only one used by the Anunnaki-Ulema.The Anunnaki-Ulema and Rouhaniyiin reject the idea that the week consistsof seven days.Their week consists of four days, corresponding to certain days of ourweek. These are the only days to use in this technique, and the other threedays in our week should not be calculated upon. The Ulema-Anunnaki and Mounawariin’s days are:Day 1: Thilta (Tuesday)Day 2: Araba (Wednesday)Day 3: Jema (Friday)Day 4: Saba (Saturday).The importance of these days is the relationship between the person and thehours in each day. Using the calendar of the Anunnaki-Ulema, each personcan find the luckiest hour of his or her week, according to the Book ofRamadosh (Rama-Dosh).Ulema Rabbi Mordachai said: “You might feel that one hour a week is notsufficient for anyone’s needs. It might also not improve your luck at work ifit occurs, say, at two o’clock in the morning each Saturday. Thispredicament can be easily resolved by performing another technique, TimeManipulation, on that exact hour. The time that will be added to your lifeunder such circumstances will be as lucky as the original hour, and yourchances of success will be vastly improved.” The Rouhaniyiin andMounawariin teachers highly recommend performing a combination oftechniques, since each enhances the other considerably. The calendars’ grids:A couple of questions might arise as you work with this technique. First, areall people with the same number of letters in their name share a lucky hour?Yes, indeed they would. There are only sixteen grid lines to representmillions of people each. And this leads to an interesting discovery. Thenumbers of letters in people’s names represent a certain harmony that existsbetween them. For example, if you wish to approach someone in high placesfor a favor, finding that he or she shares the number of letters and the luckyhour will enhance your chances.510"},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"Always send your request to him or her during the lucky hour, either bycalling on the phone, using your e-mail, or placing a written letter in themailbox. The use of a language:Another question is the issue of languages. What if your name is writtenwith four letters in America, where you live, but with five letters in yournative language?The answer is simple. Always use your native language, the language thatyou were first aware of your name in, in your grid. It will be much moreaccurate and certainly more powerful. An important fact to add is that thistechnique is simple, but it can be enhanced in many ways by subtlevariations.Adding those variations extends the knowledge of how time and space isrelated to luck and success, and how to fine tune the process. But even inthis straightforward version, the technique is incredibly powerful, so muchso that it may change your life completely, always for the better. Rou’yah: Visions.

They rebelled against theAnunnaki and broke the laws of their leader by breeding with the women ofthe Earth. Contrary to the general belief, the Anunnaki were not the firstextraterrestrial race to marry, or the have sexual relations with the womenof earth.The subjects of Sata-na-il were the first to take the Earth’s women as theirwives. But because they were integrated into the Anunnaki’s community,many believed that they were Anunnaki themselves.According to the Sumerian mythology and the Bible, their sin and breakingthe laws of the Anakh caused the Deluge.

Soul: One of the many manifestations of the mind, although the soul does notmanifest itself in any form or shape, not even in an etheric or ethereal sense.Buddhism also uses mind instead of soul.Soul is a metaphysical concept created by Man. Soul is a religious ideacreated by humans to explain and/or to believe in what they don’tunderstand. It is more accurate to use the word Mind instead.The mind thinks and understands. The soul does not, perhaps it feels, if it isto be considered as a vital force and source of feelings in your physicalbody.The difference between Soul and Mind resides in the purpose of each.Although both aim at a higher level of spirituality, the Mind surpasses theSoul, because it contains it. In the afterlife, such source of feelings is non-existent, and in the dimensions of the after world, such source is useless.Because the Anunnaki’s mix to create us did not contain what humans call“Soul”, the soul never entered our bodies.There is another non-physical element called Mind that substitutes for thesoul.

And everything also depends on who has been summoned. Are they Angels?Demons? Afrit? Or souls trapped in the doomed zone?”In the old days, it was used by the Sahiriin in Baghdad, Mosul, Damascus,and many parts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, to influence judges and rulers.Many have claimed they were set free and/or acquitted, because a Saheropened up for them the magical circle of Tasiir.This technique was banned/condemned by Prophet Mohammad, and later onby his companions.

Wasila: Term referring to uninvited bad spirits.Spirits are found everywhere. Some live in confined areas, others, righthere, on Earth, around us, wherever we go, and lots of them follow us.Allamah Sadek bin Jaafar Al Kouraychi said, “Hawa lil Al Arwaah,Arwaah al Hawa”, meaning, “Air for the spirits, the spirits of the air.”He meant that the air we breathe, the atmosphere we live in are full ofspirits and entities. The unseen world is their habitat, and it is an immenseworld full with spirits and entities. Some entities want to enter the world ofthe living and create a rapport with us. They have their own agenda. One way to do it is to invade our zone, thespace defined by the Khateyn Tarika.This zone is their gateway and passage to our bodies and mental faculties.As soon as our mind is weakened for a variety of reasons, particularlyfinancial and emotional reasons, the Khateyn Tarika weaken considerably,and our Double becomes agitated. If the situation worsens, the two lines ofthe Khateyn Tarika begin to distance themselves from our physical body.And when these two lines cross over the distance of 6 feet, which is527"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"normally our safe zone, the Double is instantly displaced, and pushed out ofthe two lines.This is a very dangerous situation, because we have lost the Double as aguardian, and we have lost the two lines as our protective shield.This is the moment bad spirits would invade our zone. And the doorbecomes wide open to a fleet of uninvited bad spirits. They enter one afteranother, unchallenged and head towards our bodies. You can call thispossession.Once inside our bodies, our brain (Mind) is instantly perturbed, and thepossessed individuals begin to lose their reasoning and mental stability.Some entities will anchor themselves deep within our physical body, andthe very fabric of our psyche and emotions.This unquestionably would create mental illness. Possessed people begin tohear voices, and act under the influence of these voices.Some entities move in and outside of our bodies at will. A few of themwould manifest in the flesh right in front of us, and this manifestation isterrifying. Quite often when a possessed person tells us stories about these apparitions,we rush to say “You are seeing things”.Well yes! He/she is seeing things. These things are the very disturbingmanifestations of the entities.Financial worries, fear, constant failures, addiction to drugs, and emotionalsuffering disrupt the peace in our body’s zone. They register on the 2 linesof Khateyn Tarika. The healthy colors of the two lines begin to deteriorate,to weaken, and finally they distance themselves from our bodies.When the two lines are no longer close to our body, our Double isimmediately kicked out from our zone.The bad entities see this. They even smell our emotional problems and fear.Like dogs and cats who smell the odor of the sickness of their owners(Especially when these odors and smells are caused by cancer andthreatening tumors), the bad entities too smell our worries and fears. And here we have two scenarios: Scenario one pertains to a case when wehave summoned an entity not knowing that this entity is from the lower level.Entities from the lower dimensions move in groups. They are never alone.They jointly prey on people.As soon as one of them invades our weakened zone, all the other entitiesfollow.The Bible, religious scriptures, the Prophet Mohammad, and even Jesus528"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"Christ talked about a bunch of bad entities who simultaneously and jointlyentered human bodies, and refused to leave. So, as you see, one bad entityalways brings along several other entities.Malevolent entities are exactly like wild beasts who hunt jointly in a pack(Wolves, lionesses, hyenas, etc.) Dealing with a bunch of bad entities:What should a beginner do if when summoning an entity, findshimself/herself dealing with a whole bunch of them? Answer: The Sahiriin and the Rouhaniyiin have lots of powerful commandsto dispose of the bad entities. You will find plenty of commands to repeland/or send away Afarit, and bad entities in volume one and volume two ofthis series. The Taaleb must memorize these commands. Some commandsdeal specifically with this or that entity. This is a very difficult andthreatening situation. You can’t tell the bad entities “Hey buddy wait aminute, let me find the command in the book, so I can command and kickyour ass out!!” This would be a big mistake.This is why I have insisted that beginners and adepts should and must knowall these commands by heart.You will have no time at all to regain control of the situation, while makingthe entities wait, until you find the proper command. It would be too late.And as soon as one bad entity squeezes in, expect to see more malevolentspirits doing the same. Usually, such intrusion is accompanied by a horriblesulphuric odor.This is how we sense their presence when they do not manifest in the flesh.Ironically, the malevolent spirits enjoy this intoxicating smell.In fact, it is through this sulphuric odor that they follow each other.Of course, they do not need to smell each other to recognize each other,since they come from the same Kirba, meaning habitat. But the odor of one“squeezed in” Afrit or bad entity, is an open invitation to other entities toinvade our weakened zone and possess our body.The awfully bad odor marks their territory.In this particular case, the territory is our weakened zone.

Andfor the period of 17 years, there is a calendar, well structured and dividedin a sequence of 77 by 7.This brings us to the Anunnaki-Ulema magical-esoteric number of 777,considered to be the Alpha and Omega of all knowledge and “Tana-Wur”(Enlightenment), similar to the Bodhisattva.At one point during the lucky years, a person will acquire two extraordinaryfaculties:1- Rou’h Ya (Prohetic Visions)2- Firasa (Reading People, just by looking at their faces).These two faculties will positively influence your life and guide you532"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"effortlessly toward reaching the highest level of mental and physicalstrength, as well success in business and varied endeavors.Some of these endeavors for instance, is an astonishing power or capabilityof producing, writing or composing in an exceptional prolific and fastmanner.It also encompass the ability of learning many languages in no time, andreading manuscripts written in secret languages, such as the first secret andhidden alphabet (Characters) of the Hindu language.

Allan Cardec_______________________________ One of the last Mounawirin (Enlightened) known to have discovered thesecret of the 17 lucky years was Alan Cardec “Allan Cardec” (October 3,1804- March 31, 1869). Cardec’s real name was Hippolyte Léon DenizardRivail.And his Ulema name was Asha-Kar-Da-Ki. His mentor was the legendaryJohann Heinrich Pestalozzi, also known as “Mirdach Kadoshi Sirah” in theAnunnaki-Ulema circle.533"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"His incarnated guiding master (Second high level of Anunnaki-Ulema) wasAl Zafiru, called Sefiro or Zefiro in mediumship and spiritism literature. In fact, the word or term “Spiritism” was coined by Cardec.He was the first to use it and explain its application during a contact with ahigher entity and other rapports with dead people (Trapped deceasedpersons) who asked for his help. Sometimes, it was the way around; Cardecasked for their guidance on matter related to life after death, and the realmof the next life.Master Allan Cardec (Kardec) was the father of the French movement ofSpiritism, and communications with entities trapped between the nextdimension and Earth’s boundaries.They are called “Les retenus”, meaning those who were trapped in theafterlife dimension, or more precisely, those who were detained.Cardec was burried at the historical French cemetry Cimetiere du PereLachaise.The inscription on his tomb stele reads: \"Naitre, mourir, renaitre encore etprogresser sans cesse, telle est la loi.” Translated verbatim: “To be born,die, to be reborn again and to progress unceasingly, such is the law.” Zihaab: Departure.

Communication withour dead pets.Gensi-uzuruis is associated with apparition of dead pets, and ourcommunication with them during a very specific time period.The Ulema and Rouhaniyiin are very fond of animals. Extensive passages inthe Book of Rama-Dosh speak about the important role animals play in thelife of humans, especially at emotional and therapeutic levels.The Ulema believe that pets understand very well their human-friends(Instead of using the word “owners”). And also, pets communicate withthose who show them love and affection. This loving relationship betweenpets and their human-friends does not end when pets die. Is it possible to communicate with our dead pets?Although the Anunnaki-Ulema do not believe in any possibility ofcontacting deceased people or animals ad infinitum, they have explained tous that contacting our departed ones is possible for a very short time, andonly during the 40 days period following their death.In other words, we can contact our pets, deceased parents and dear ones, ormore accurately enter in contact with them if:a-They contact us short after their death;b-They must initiate the contact;c-This should happen during a 40 days period following theirdeparture;d-Their contact (Physical or non-physical) must be noticed by us.This means that we should and must pay an extra attention to“something” quite irregular or unusual happening around us.Because our departed pets will try to send us messages, and inmany instances, they do.e-We must expect their messages, and strongly believe in thosemessages. Communication with our pets:Pets can contact us via different ways that we can sense if we havedeveloped a strong bond with them. Pets know who love them and thosewho don’t, because pets feel, understand, sense and see our aura.All our feelings and thoughts are imprinted in our aura, and the aura iseasily visible to pets, particularly, cats, dogs, parrots, lionesses, pigs, andhorses. This belief is shared by authors, people of science and therapists inthe West, despite major difference between Westerners and Ulema indefining the nature and limits of pets-humans after death contact.537"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":" Zoohoor and Baa rada hiwan: Baa rada means the company of, or being inthe presence of. Hiwan means animals, more precisely domesticatedanimals; pets, such as dogs and cats.In the Sahiriin’s literature and esoteric practices, cats play a major role; arole that rotates around prediction of events to occur within a short periodof time, and sensing danger. Cats are also considered a “Psychic Conduit”by Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin. In fact, in some of their black magic Jalasaat(Séances), Sahiriin would bring in a cat to help sense, receive and sendmessages and predictions.The occultic practice “Nizraat al Kout” (Visions or Predictions of the Cat)was very active in ancient Egypt and the Near East.On a happier note, the Sahiriin and Rouhaniyiin strongly recommend toadopt cats, and care for them, for they could be very useful to their owners;they are capable of sensing imminent dangers, catastrophes, mishaps, andabove all, their instinctive nature leads them to warn their owners, littlechildren, and people who love them against danger.Cheik Tabet Hafiz Al Ansari once told me, “A cat in the house is blessing.”Humans can learn a lot from their cats, if they bother to watch, study andunderstand their behavior. Quite often, cats stare at something the human eyecan’t see. And in some instance, and for a few seconds, cats remain frozenin their attention upon looking at the unknown which seems to appear tothem in etheric forms. The Sahiriin told us that these etheric forms could be spirits, the souls ofdead people who are interested in the occupants of the house, dead littlegirls and boys who can’t realize that they are dead now, and keep on playingwith their toys and running right and left in particular parts of the house theyused to live in; in our case, the current house of the cat who is staring atthem.The Sahiriin taught us that we should pay attention to the observing cat, toremain calm and patient, and watch what the cat is doing, how the cat isstaring at things we can’t see, to not bother the cat, and to take notes of thereaction of the cat.This exercise of ours should not stop there. We should keep on observingour cat, and taking notes, and above all to draw a map of the places in ourhome which seem to interest the cat and/or provoke the cat to sense theunseen; a map which could include more than one place in our home andlocate the etheric zone of spirits, and even a web of openings, a sort of time-space vortices, or simply a “playground” for spirits.538"},{"pageNumber":539,"pageContent":"How do pet psychics communicate with animals?Jennifer Wallens, the world’s #1 pet psychic and animal communicator said,“I can say that I mostly use telepathy to communicate with the animals and totap into their world. Telepathy is the sending and receiving of information by way of words,feelings and images. I also use my ability to tune in psychically and hearwords sometimes transmitted, as well as feel their emotions and pick upcolors, medical conditions, and other issues. I do look at them physicallyand pick up on the body language as well. So for me it is a combination ofusing every ability and tool I have. Animals will sometimes first flash an image to me, and allow me to tune into them and feel where their pain is, or what problem they are having, or ifthere is something they want, and they will show that item or activity as animage.”She added, “A funny example the other night happened when my little 10year old toy poodle Tinkerbell, sat up in the bed looked straight at me afterwe got into bed, staring deeply at me, I looked at her, cleared my mind, andimmediately saw a vanilla wafer in an image! The last two nights I had brought a some Nilla Vanilla wafers with a glassof milk to bed, and each of my poodles had received a treat. Well, needlessto say I went back to the kitchen and brought back the special requestedtreat, much to their delight. It truly amazes me how incredibly intelligentthey are and they are just waiting for us to catch up and realize they arecommunicating all the time, in their own way.I have developed my own technique which I may adjust according to theanimal I am working with or whether I am with them in person. If I am therewith the animal, I look at their reactions, and I always first lay a hand onthem to comfort them and look into their eyes with out saying anything.I smile and send out loving energy to them and then ask telepathically whatthey would like to convey to me that I may tell their owner/family. If there isa problem I am aware of, I focus on the awareness of this issue and thesolution to the problem, not just the problem. It is important to vieweverything from the same perspective of the animal to truly understand them.I wait for an image, feeling, emotion, or clairaudiently, words or phrases tobegin the telepathic exchange. 539"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"The great psychic and medium Jennifer Wallens._____________________________________ If I am not able to meet directly with the animal, then I can do this withphotos of the animal and communication with their owner over the phone orSKYPE.

The process, or at least the abridged version is:1-Challenge them to come forth in the Christed Light.(This is a powerful white light energy that was brought to the planet to be ofservice by Jesus, it is a force to be reckoned with and can be relied upon toserve in these situations quite beautifully.)

Q: Entities who respond to magical practices during Spirits’ Séance andPsychic Readings, are they souls/spirits of dead people, or angels anddemons, or totally different entities such as Djinn, Afarit, Ghouls and othermulti-dimensional entities?Answer: The only way I can answer this question is to say \"Yes!\" They areall of the above, however in a traditional, or dare I say typical seance, theyare more apt to be souls/spirits of those who are present who have comeforward to share, or maybe a spirit needing assistance crossing over.If you are doing work specifically in the Angelic Realm, then you couldanticipate the presence of Angels and on occassion there can also be awayward demon but this is rare indeed, because generally the protectionwork put in place in the setting up of the seance, or a Reading for thatmatter, would create a barrier disallowing those energies access. This does not mean that one can't work in that realm though and evoke thatenergy, that is possible and there are those who do. Multi dimensional entities tend to come through as a more direct channeland not really within the seance reality sometimes however, as withanything spiritual, it can happen, but in my knowledge and experience this isalso quite rare. These energies are more inclinced to move into a willing vessel who willfunction as a direct channel for them. In readings all aspects can be touched upon and may participate dependingon the situation and what is of highest service to the person being read for,or at least that is my experience. Q: Did you have any encounter and/or experience with malevolent spirits?And how did you deal with them?Answer: I have had an encounter with malevolent spirits on more then oneoccassion. One was in physical form, a possession if you will, that I had toliterally gain the trust of in order to survive, literally. That is a whole othersubject, but I can tell you that physical possession happens and this is whysome people do seemingly unthinkable acts. When I was able to gain thetrust of this entity then I was able to ultimately get away from them. Ultimately I was able to clear the space they had infiltrated and in essencesend them into the void. Or, better said, let the light take care of them.

I endedthe session with the client and called one of my teachers and they guided methrough a very intense healing session where this soul was literallyunlocked from the darker side and sent swiftly to the light. It was a very rewarding experience in the end, however it was bothfrightening and toxic to me until it was properly handled. I learned a lot thatday! There has been some other work I have done here as well, but suffice it tosay, I walk in the light, I serve the light and at this time in my life and work Ihave some amazing Guardians. I will offer this insight to my growth andpower on this level and that is that none of us are alone, nor are we meant toface, or do battle on our own. This is not the way it is meant to be.

It's somethingthat is tangible, a cause and effect, like people reading tarot cards, forexample.Most good readers could read without their cards, but they kind of use themas a crutch, not in the way of them not believing in themselves.More in the way that using something you can see, show to your client yourthought process, it makes it easier to say, \"See this?It means this.\" If your heart and head are in disagreement, it also personallycan give you a visual, tangible compass.I also definitely use various stones in a ritualistic way to \"amplify\" or\"enhance\" my ability, so I guess \"magic\" is a broad term for me, more of asynonym for manifesting or a belief that ritualistic thoughts/behaviours canstrongly effect a desired outcome.Q: Entities who respond to magical practices during Spirits’ Séance andPsychic Readings, are they souls/spirits of dead people, or angels anddemons, or totally different entities such as Djinns, Afarit, Ghouls and othermulti-dimensional entities?Answer: That is another difficult question. I have mostly dealt with lovedones of clients, and not much dark energy, and there's a reason for that.In my opinion the best way to call any spirit of the light or any positivehigher vibrational being, is erethral light.Simply light a candle and speak their name, if you know it. Speak of yourfondest memories, and it will draw the spirit (of most any loved one) near. Jessicca: It matters that it is a wish from your heart.________________________________________ As for Djinn, Afarit, any seriously lower vibrational being/ spirit, Ihaven't dealt with anything like that yet, thank goodness, so I have noexperience to speak on that.I have an excellent spirit guide team, and they are pretty good at keeping575"},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"negative entities from me.I think souls that are trapped in what we humans call purgatory, or just the inbetween, can be easily romanced in a Séance to come forth to prove theirexistance.This especially so if they are stuck there because they are not at rest, theywill want to find peace and will use the spell or invocation or Ouija boardor seance, if they can, to reach out. I think if you're not really careful, andby that I mean, having a strong and positive intention, a good deal ofknowledge in the metaphysical areas of cleansing, grounding, and protectingyour self and your personal space, then you could innocently butinadvertently let some bad energies feel welcome in your space, and youdon't want that. Q: Did you have any encounter and/or experience with malevolent spirits?And how did you deal with them?Answer: As I said previously, I have a pretty good spirit guide team, but weare constantly improving our communication, so there was a time when wehad some... shall we say clarity issues?I had a spirit come to me and show me for about a month randomly over andover the scene of her death.From several different angles and perspectives I saw her murder, a gun shotin the face.Let's just say I was ultimately grossed out, and asked my guides to no longershow me any negative things like that.Nothing unpleasent, to include the graphic parts of the death, morbidly grossthings the soul has endured, etc. After stating it, it became a rule and mynegatives became more symbols or bits of movies rather than the first handaccount.At the same time, though, I also stopped seeing a lot of negative things, likeevery where. In pictures where other people, even other intuitives, felt\"evil\" or \"a bad feeling\" or such, in my personal relationships, every where,I saw nothing \"bad\".As a consequence I slacked off on doing my ritual cleansing techniquesaround the house, not feeling the shifting in the energy. My younger sonbegan having night mares, waking wide eyed, fearfull, squeeling in chokedfear, pointing to a very specific area in their room, claiming to see a bigdark figured man with no eyes. Creeped me out, so, naturally (big flourishhere, ha ha) I got my sage stick, my bell, and my camera, and commenced todo the \"ritual\" we talked about in the beginning.Then I had to discuss with my spirit guide team, not to completely block576"},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"every negative, as I can't protect myself and those I love, from what I can'tfeel. I realize some of the \"bad things\" just have to happen, but they arebetter at not letting in the lower energies when the team determines that Ican't help the lower energy/ entity.So, the man my son saw hasn't returned, and didn't bother him any longerafter the night I cleansed my whole house, (his bedroom twice for goodmeasure) and I learned yet another much needed life lesson.Contact:Facebook: Psychic & Medium Readings by JessiccaTwitter @PsychicJessiccaPsychicJessicca.blogspot.comE-mail: Jessicca8178@gmail.com 577"},{"pageNumber":578,"pageContent":" Reverend Chanda ReavesB.Msc, AAS, CMA (AAMA)___________________________ Do you believe “Bad Spirits” exist? And do they interfere in people’s lives? As a Lightworker, can you get ridof those bad spirits, and how do you do it?Answer: I don’t “believe” bad spirits exist. I “know” bad spirits exist. Tobelieve that something exist may or may not be based in facts. However, to“know” a thing exists, is based in facts. Reverend Reaves: I know that “Bad Spirits” fully havethe capacity to interfere in people’s lives negatively and insome instances tragically. As a Lightworker, I am able to assist in ridding a person or individuals thatare being haunted by “bad spirits”. Through the practice of GuaraniShamanism, I have aided many individuals and families rid themselves,their homes and businesses from malevolent, lost, and confused spirits. I assist in helping “Bad Spirits” to cross over from the 3D reality wherethey are sharing our spacing and time into their own prospective 4th and or5th dimensional realities according to their own personal ascensionprocess. Q: How do you incorporate any magical principle in your practice as aLightworker? And is magic a spiritual form of communication with theSpirit World?Answer: The incorporation of any magical principle in my practice as alightworker starts with the knowledge of the three basic classes of entitiesthat are instrumental in magic being productive as form of communication,usually spiritual.The first class of spiritual beings is those that are non-corporal ordisembodied spirits of humans and animals. Many of the indigenous peoples578"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"of the world call upon their ancestors, totem animal spirit guides, and orprotectors to assist them in their magical workings. “Magic is definitely a spiritual form of communicationwith the Spirit World.”____________________________________ The second class are spiritual beings that are created through our thoughtswhich are made manifest etherically who serve a specific purpose arecalled, “Thought forms”.When working with Thoughtform entities you literally build that specificenergy into an etheric form with a specific function, purpose and or goal inmind. As thought being the purest form of energy in the Universe, an adept is ableto build these Thoughtform entities from the constructs of their ownconsciousness through utilizing visualization techniques, physical use oftheir bodies, and their own life force energy. A great example of this is an Egregore through which a Thoughtform entitythat can be constructed by an individual or multiple individuals for thecommon goal of the individual or group for a specific bidding, purpose, andor magical working. The third classes of spiritual beings entities may or may not be non-corporalin form; however, they have a pre-existing life force of their own and areknown as Elementals or Nature Spirits. 579"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"These types of spirits are generally found in nature through legends andfolklore in cultures around the world, such as Djinns, Afarit, Gnomes,Elves, Leprechauns, Ghouls, Trolls, Nymphs, Sylphs, Fairies, Gremlins andGoblins. “Elementals can be both interdimensional andmultidimensional.” To elicit the assistance of an Elemental, invocations must be made to callthe Elemental into service. Magical principles are then applied by the use of specific written andverbal language(s), ritual workings, homage, and servitude that mayberequired in invoking the Elementals assistance. When working withElementals ones approach must be that of reverence and respect. In order toincorporate magic in the communication process of the Spirt World, onemust fully comprehend these concepts and be able to apply the propertechniques of effective spiritual communication based on the class ofspiritual entity one is actively working with. Q: Entities who respond to magical practices during Spirit’ Séance andPsychic Readings, are they souls/spirits of dead people, or angels anddemons, or totally different entities such as Djinn, Afarit Ghouls and othermultidimensional entities?Answer: In my personal experience, I have had contact with deceasedpersons, Angelic and Demonic beings, Egregores, Elementals,Interdimensional as well as various Multidimensional Entities. During psychic readings and mediumship, one must be prepared for what isattached etherically to the client. I have performed a multitude of readings where there’s more than onedeceased relative that has been trying to communicate with the client and thegroup of spirits appears through the ether together of which all areclairaudible. Needless to say, sometimes multiple spirits try to speak at once. However,it best to instruct the spirits to address messages one at a time, so that nomessage is lost, and the transmissions from each spirit are complete. I have exorcised malevolent spirits and demons during Guarani Shamanicexorcisms. 580"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"I have seen spirit teachers and guides that accompany clients and delivermessages and or warnings for the clients.

And how did you deal with them?Answer: I have had numerous encounters with malevolent spirits. As aMetaphysical Practitioner who specializes in Metaphysical Parapsychology,I am called upon by clients that are actively experiencing malevolentparanormal phenomenon. Of course I approach each case individually and objectively reverentlyrespecting my clients’ experiences as they are very real and personal. I incorporate metaphysical science and paranormal research withcompassion and understanding of how terrifying dealing with malevolentspirits can be. I also respect the malevolent spirits and listen effectively to the spirit(s) sothat the extraction process will not be difficult and performed in a safe andeffective manner.First, I give my clients the knowledge and tools of how to effectively protectand shield themselves from being under physical and psychic attack frommalevolent spirits. If the offending spirit is haunting the individual(s), I use a spiritual cleansingtechnique that clears the clients’ auric-etheric fields and shields them fromfurther psychic vampirism or psychic attacks by malevolent spirits andentities.When a residential or commercial dwelling is haunted, provisions are takento smudge and consecrate the grounds, along with metaphysical prayerinvocations. Second, ritual workings are then performed for spiritual extraction andsealing of the portals of which the entities are entering through, such as avortex in the dwelling. During the extraction process, communication isinitiated with the offending spirit to identify what type of entity is presentand why the entity is causing negative paranormal activity. 581"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"Once the entity is identified and its case is heard, the entity is escorted to itsextraction point, crossed over into its prospective dimensional reality, andthen the portal/vortex is sealed closed.

Often, bad spirits are brought on by weakness due to unhappiness, fear,anger, negativity, substance abuse or a whole host of things that keep us frombeing in our light or standing in our power.Some spirits are real otherworldly entities and beings – and some weactually create ourselves and breathe the life into them by our thoughts andactions.

Once I was doing a séance at a veryhaunted old home in the Hollywood Hills. The former tenants included silent film stars, The Rolling Stones, theMamas & the Papas and most recently Marilyn Manson. The house had adark, tangled energy and literally drew chaotic, creative people to it. I knewthat house would never be happy with a “normal” family living there. Icould also feel that there was an angry spirit present who was not happy wewere there. We had two film crews shooting the séance for two differentprojects, one of which was a documentary about the house.The séance participants were the current tenants and their friends andneighbors.I think there were about a dozen people total.I explained to everyone how I worked, set up the space, protections, etc –and that the only thing I asked was an open mind, and to take it seriously andbe respectful of what we were doing, and any spirits who may appear. Patti Negri: Respect the paranormal and its power!___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ We were starting to get some real insights and finding out some darkinformation about things that had happened in the house in the 1920s. One ofthe participants started getting a little ‘smart alecky” and makingwisecracks. Things started happening immediately. The French Doors flew open on their own accord. The speakers, which were not even plugged in or turned on, started makingstatic or white noise on and off and the energy was building and building sothat everyone could feel it. One more wisecrack from the guy and all of a sudden, my cameraman – whowas directly across from him and shooting in his direction burst intoflames! The flames started shooting up his back in a V shape – almost like angelwings of fire. They burned his shirt right off like it was synthetic, but it was589"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"all cotton. Everyone was screaming and jumping up from the table. The “medic” in me came out and I yelled “drop and roll” and before weknew it the whole thing was over. Blisters started forming on his lower back by the end of the evening, but hesaid he was okay. We decided to continue the séance. I laid down a lot more protection, called in more wards and got seriouswith the participants about being respectful (Which they now had noproblem obeying). We had one more glass literally fly out of a cupboard after filming, but I wasable to calm the angry spirit. When I saw the cameraman’s scar a few weeks later, it had taken the exactshape of a dragon, a dragon with big teeth, winged ears and body narrowingdown into a serpent. It was pretty amazing. I believe it was dragon energy that came in to protect him – and now he hadquite the keepsake. It all turned out well, and we got some great footage, but it could’ve had adisastrous ending. Patti Negri: You have to know what you aredoing.________________________________________ My advice to anyone working in this realm is most importantly: RESPECTthe paranormal and its power! You have to know what you are doing. This is not a game. Study, learn and make sure you are trained and well versed in paranormalprinciples and psychic protection methods. Whatever cosmology ormodality you are working in – really know it! Be very clear as to who or what you are inviting in – and make sure thatanyone with you takes it just as seriously and follows your rules andguidelines. Always work in the light. Be clear to only invite in friendly,benevolent, helpful spirits and entities – and be firm that no others areallowed into your sacred space.

Maximillien de Lafayette’s interest in and involvement with the paranormal andmetaphysics began in 1953. Although he is a lawyer (Practicing international lawand intellectual property law abroad), the author of more than 2,500 books in 26languages, a linguist and a conservative historian by trade, and thus, a pragmaticthinker, Maximillien’s intense fascination by the occult and supernatural phenomenatook him on a legendary journey to the realms of the Mounawariin (EnlightenedMasters), the Rouhaniyiin (The Spirituals), and Tahiriin (The Pure Ones), knownto us as the Honorable Anunnaki Ulema.

Quiteoften, spiritual teachers, guides, channelers, psychics, mediums and healers talkabout that un-je-ne-sais-quoi “Energy”! But rarely, do they explain in simple terms,what that energy is! What is made from? How energy is created? How energycould be sensed and directed? How to use it to create a positive environment? Howto use energy to block others’ negative thoughts and unhealthy energy? Can we seeothers’ energy? Can we see our own energy? And, can we measure energy?If pertinent answers and explanations are not given to us, then, kiss goodbye thatenergy, and all the mambo-jumbo lectures of the spiritual masters and so-calledpsychics. And, it’s as simple as that. In order to develop the mental power of ourmind, we must first, discover the energy of our mind and body. This discoverycould be achieved through Ikti-Chafa, which the author has explained at length inthe book. All of us possess what others call “supernatural powers.” In fact, there isnothing “supernatural” at all. It is a matter of discovering and understanding howmental vibrations are created and transmitted. The book offers techniques whichwill enable you to use the power of your mind over matter. It is not an easy task,but it could be done if you practice and persevere. In addition to discovering andanimating the power of your mind (Mental energy), you must absolutelyunderstand how Mintaka Difaya works. Mintaka Difaya is related to “Protectingyour Zone”, the physical and mental zone that surrounds your body. Without suchprotection, our mental power will remain minimal.

Judgeship. • Dayono in ancient Assyrian means a judge; a magistrate. • Dayono in contemporary Assyrian Western dialect. • Dayono in Aramaic. • Also Dayanu in Akkadian. • Dayan in Arabic means a judge; a head of a tribunal or a council. Literally, it means the one whojudges people for their deeds and actions at the end of time (Day of Judgment); in this context, itrefers to Allah (God). • Dayyan (Talmudic Judge) in Hebrew. • Dayonutho in ancient Assyrian and contemporary Assyrian Western dialect means judgeship. • Daianuta in contemporary Assyrian Eastern dialect. • Din in ancient Assyrian means the law. • Dino in ancient Hebrew. • Dinatu in Babylonian-Assyrian means laws. • “Dinatu attu-a in birid mati aganetu usazgu.” From the Behistun Inscriptions. • Translated verbatim: “My laws amongst these provinces flourished. • Dinu in Akkadian and Babylonian-Assyrian means to judge, and to rule. • Bet diino in Aramaic means a court of law, a tribunal, and a courthouse. • In Arabic, Beth-diin means house of religion. • Beth-diino is composed of two words: • a-Beth, which means a house, • b-Diino, which means the law. From diino derived the Hebrew and Arabic words Dayan, which means a judge, more precisely aTalmudic judge and a judge in a religious court. Diino is Diin in Arabic, and its means religion. In ancient Islamic literature and religious texts, Dayan refers to God (Allah) the judge who will passjudgment on dead people at the end of time. The primitive meaning of Dino was religion. In Arabic,it is Din (Religion), as well as Dayana, Diyana. So, the primordial meaning was a religious tribunal. This is understandable, because in ancient times,all laws (Civil, social, military, penal, etc.) were based upon religious dogma and teachings. Worth mentioning here, that there is a famous historic city in Lebanon called Beit El-Din “Bet Din”,“Beiteddin”. At one time in history, this ancient city was the most important city in Lebanon and the siege of Emir(Prince) Bashir Chehab, the ruler of Lebanon, appointed by the Sultan of Turkey.
