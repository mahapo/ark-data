I was instantly aware of being in touch with one of the great mindsof this century. I wrote about him for the first time in 1955, in the concludingchapter of The Outsider, where he figures (with Ramakrishna and T.E. Hulme) asone of the few men who have glimpsed a solution to the ‘sickness of man in thetwentieth century’. Since then I have written about him in several books—notablyThe Occult and Mysteries.When the publishers of the present book suggested that I should write aboutGurdjieff, I experienced misgivings; it would involve repeating a great dealthat I have already written. But then, my own views on Gurdjieff have changedand evolved over the years, and the idea of getting them between two covers wasan interesting challenge. So I brushed aside my doubts, decided to repeat myselfwhere necessary, and wrote the book. And in repeating myself I discovered anentirely new set of meanings and implications in Gurdjieff.It was an interesting lesson in the difference between ‘grasping’ and merely‘knowing’—a distinction that lies at the heart of Gurdjieff’s thought.Which is why I make no apology to those who have read me on Gurdjieff before.His ideas will bear repetition."},{"pageContent":"1—THE MAGICIANOn a bright summer morning in 1917, an attractive Russian woman in her latetwenties sat in Phillipov’s cafe, in St Petersburg’s Nevsky Prospect, waitingfor the arrival of her friend Peter Demianovitch Ouspensky.Uncharacteristically, Ouspensky was late. When he finally hurried in, he was ina state of unusual excitement. His first words were: ‘I think this time we’vereally found what we need.’ And he reminded her that in Moscow, in 1915, he hadmet a remarkable teacher, who spoke of the fundamental problems of humanexistence with an air of knowledge and authority. His name was George IvanovitchGurdjieff. Now, said Ouspensky, Gurdjieff had come to St Petersburg—and was, atthat very moment, waiting for them in another branch of Phillipov’s across theroad. The lady, Anna Butkovsky, says:> When I entered the other Phillipov’s I saw a man sitting at a table in the far> corner, wearing an ordinary black coat and the high astrakhan cap that Russian> men wear in winter. Signs of Greek ancestry could be discerned in his fine,> virile features and in the look that pierced right through you (though not in> an unpleasant way). He had an oval-shaped head, black eyes and an olive> complexion, and wore a black moustache. His manner was very calm and relaxed,> and he spoke without any gesticulation. Even to be sitting with him was very> agreeable. Though it was not his native language, he could speak Russian> fluently, in a manner not quite like ours, more exact and very picturesque.> Sometimes he would speak in a ‘lazy’ voice, and you felt that each phrase was> being carefully and specially put together, for that particular occasion, not> at all like the ready-made phrases which we would normally use in> conversation, devoid of creative power or individuality. You quickly grasped> that he had a gift of assembling words expressively. And here I sat, and I> felt that I was at last in the presence of a Guru.Gurdjieff made the same kind of impression on everyone who met him. We have,perhaps, a dozen records by pupils describing their first meeting. Almostwithout exception, they mention that ‘look that pierced right through you’. Ayoung army officer named Thomas de Hartmann met Gurdjieff at about the sametime. When two men wearing black coats and black moustaches approached him inthe cafe, he wondered which was Gurdjieff. ‘But my uncertainty was quicklydispelled by the eyes of one of the men.’ J.G. Bennett, who met Gurdjieff inConstantinople in 1920, wrote: ‘I met the strangest pair of eyes I have everseen. The two eyes were so different that I wondered if the light had playedsome trick on me.’ And all these different impressions are summarized in aremark made by the wife of the physician Kenneth Walker after she met Gurdjieffin Paris in 1948: ‘The chief impression he gave me was the impression of immensevigour and of concentrated strength. I had the feeling that he was not really aman but a magician.’Gurdjieff was, in fact, a kind of magician. There can be no doubt that hepossessed certain magical or psychic powers. But he seems to have regarded theseas irrelevant or unimportant. Gurdjieff’s central concern was with thepotentialities of human beings—or, more specifically, of human consciousness.Ouspensky expressed it clearly in a little book called The Psychology of Man’sPossible Evolution, where he remarks that ordinary psychology is concerned withman as he actually exists. But there is another kind, that studies man ‘not fromthe point of view of what he is, or what he seems to be, but from the point ofview of what he may become; that is, from the point of view of his possibleevolution.’Expressed in this way, the idea sounds vague and general. But Gurdjieff’sapproach was precise and particular. The writings of his pupils—ordisciples—contains many accounts of the operation of his own remarkable powers.Fritz Peters, an American who had known Gurdjieff since childhood, describeswhat happened when he visited Gurdjieff in Paris immediately after the SecondWorld War. His war experiences had brought Peters to the verge of a nervousbreakdown. The moment Gurdjieff saw him, he realized that he was sick.> When we reached his apartment, he led me down a long hall to a dark bedroom,> indicated the bed, told me to lie down, and said: ‘This is your room, for as> long as you need it.’ I laid down on the bed and he left the room but did not> close the door. I felt such enormous relief and such excitement at seeing him> that I began to cry uncontrollably and then my head began to pound. I could> not rest and got up and walked to the kitchen where I found him sitting at the> table. He looked alarmed when he saw me, and asked me what was wrong. I said I> needed some aspirin or something for my headache, but he shook his head, stood> up, and pointed to the other chair by the kitchen table. ‘No medicine,’ he> said firmly. ‘I give you coffee. Drink as hot as you can.’ I sat at the table> while he heated the coffee and then served it to me. He then walked across the> small room to stand in front of the refrigerator and watch me. I could not> take my eyes off him and realized that he looked incredibly weary—I have never> seen anyone look so tired. I remember being slumped over the table, sipping at> my coffee, when I began to feel a strange uprising of energy within myself—I> stared at him, automatically straightened up, and it was as if a violent> electric blue light emanated from him and entered into me. As this happened, I> could feel the tiredness drain out of me, but at the same moment his body> slumped and his face turned grey as if it was being drained of life. I looked> at him, amazed, and when he saw me sitting erect, smiling and full of energy,> he said quickly: ‘You all right now—watch food on stove—I must go.’ There was> something very urgent in his voice and I leaped to my feet to help him but he> waved me away and limped slowly out of the room.What had happened, apparently, was that Gurdjieff had somehow poured vitalenergy into Peters by some psychic discipline—either that, or somehow touchedthe source of vitality in Peters himself; at all events, it drained Gurdjieff.Peters says: ‘I was convinced ... that he knew how to transmit energy fromhimself to others; I was also convinced that it could only be done at great costto himself.’What happened next is equally significant.> It also became obvious within the next few minutes that he knew how to renew> his own energy quickly, for I was amazed when he returned to the kitchen to> see the change in him; he looked like a young man again, alert, smiling, sly> and full of good spirits. He said that this was a very fortunate meeting, and> that while I had forced him to make an almost impossible effort, it had> been—as I had witnessed—a very good thing for both of us.Gurdjieff’s comment is of considerable importance. When Peters first came to theapartment, he looked tired—‘I have never seen anyone look so tired.’ He made aneffort that drained him even further, transmitting vitality to Peters. And then,within fifteen minutes, was completely renewed, and refreshed. The implicationseems clear. Gurdjieff himself had forgotten that he had the power to renew hisown energies, until the exhaustion of Fritz Peters forced him to make anenormous effort. Before Peters came, Gurdjieff had been taking his own fatiguefor granted, as something inevitable. Pouring energy into Peters reminded himthat he had the power to somehow call upon vital energy. This is why he toldPeters that this was a fortunate meeting for both of them.This story enables us to see precisely why Kenneth Walker’s wife thoughtGurdjieff a magician. It also makes it clear that his ‘magical’ powers were notof the kind that we normally associate with notorious ‘occultists’ or magicians,like Madame Blavatsky or Aleister Crowley. There are stories of Madame Blavatskycausing raps to resound from all over the room, of Crowley somehow causing mento go on all fours and howl like dogs; but never of their producing this whollytonic effect on someone. It is not even necessary to assume that Gurdjieffrevitalized Peters by some form of telepathic transfer of energy; a psychologistwould probably argue that he did it by some form of suggestion.As to Gurdjieff’s power to renew his own energies, its essence had beenunderstood by psychologists of the nineteenth century, decades before the age ofFreud and Jung. William James speaks about it in an important essay called ‘TheEnergies of Man’.> Everyone is familiar with the phenomenon of feeling more or less alive on> different days. Everyone knows on any given day that there are energies> slumbering in him which the incitements of that day do not call forth, but> which he might display if these were greater. Most of us feel as if a sort of> cloud weighed upon us, keeping us below our highest notch of clearness in> discernment, sureness in reasoning, or firmness in deciding. Compared with> what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts> are checked. We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and> physical resources. In some persons this sense of being cut off from their> rightful resources is extreme, and we then get the formidable neurasthenic and> psychasthenic conditions, with life grown into one tissue of impossibilities,> that so many medical books describe.> > Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his> limits; he possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.> He energizes below his maximum, and he behaves below his optimum. In> elementary faculty, in co-ordination, in power of inhibition and control, in> every conceivable way, his life is contracted like the field of vision of an> hysteric subject—but with less excuse, for the poor hysteric is diseased,> while in the rest of us, it is only an inveterate habit—the habit of> inferiority to our full self—that is bad.James cites the well-known phenomenon of ‘second wind’ as an example of thispower to draw upon vital reserves. When we are completing some task, he says, wemake a practice of stopping once we feel tired—once we encounter the first layerof fatigue. If we force ourselves to press on, a surprising thing happens. Thefatigue gets worse, up to a point, then suddenly vanishes, and we feel betterthan before. He mentions that one of the standard methods of treating‘neurasthenic’ patients in the nineteenth century was to bully patients intomaking a greater effort than usual. ‘First comes the very extremity of distress,then follows unexpected relief.’ And he adds: ‘We live subject to arrest bydegrees of fatigue which we have come only from habit to obey.’In this sentence, James has defined the essence of Gurdjieff’s life-work. It istrue that the ideas of Gurdjieff cover an immense range—of psychology,philosophy, cosmology, even alchemy. But at the core of his work lies thisnotion that we possess greater powers than we realize, and that our apparentlimitations are due to a peculiar form of laziness—a laziness that has become sohabitual that it has developed into a mechanism.And how can this mechanism be controlled or deactivated? In his essay on vitalreserves, William James points out that we call upon these deeper powers when weare stimulated either by crisis, or by some deep sense of urgency—of purpose. Hequotes Colonel Baird-Smith, who was in charge of the defence of Delhi during itssix week siege by Indian mutineers in 1857. His mouth was filled with sores andhis body covered with them; a wounded ankle was a black, festering mess;diarrhoea had worn him to a shadow. Unable to eat, he lived almost entirely onbrandy. Yet it seemed to have no effect on him. The crisis—the need to protectthe lives of women and children—kept him in such a state of concentrateddetermination that he remained alert and energetic during the whole siege.Clearly, he did precisely what Gurdjieff did when he left Fritz Peters sittingin the kitchen: reached down inside himself, and summoned vital reserves.In fact, this method—of deliberately seeking out stimulation, excitement, evencrisis—is one of our favourite human devices for escaping that sense of ‘a cloudweighing upon us’. A depressed housewife goes and buys herself a new hat. Abored man gets drunk. A discontented teenager steals a car or takes hisknuckledusters to a football match. Generally speaking, the greater a person’spotentiality for achievement, the greater his or her objection to that feelingof being ‘cut off from one’s rightful resources’. Shaw’s Captain Shotover tellsEllie Dunne. ‘At your age, I looked for hardship, danger, horror and death, thatI might feel the life in me more intensely.’ And this is clearly the motivationthat drove Ernest Hemingway, for example, to spend so much of his time big gamehunting, bullfighting, working as a war correspondent.This desire to break the bonds of their own laziness may even lead men to behavein ways that are obviously contrary to their best interests. Van Gogh threw up acomfortable job as an art dealer to become a lay preacher among the miners inBelgium. Lawrence of Arabia refused comfortable government appointments tobecome an ordinary aircraftman in the R.A.F. The philosopher Wittgenstein gaveaway an inherited fortune to become a badly paid schoolmaster. These ‘outsiders’were driven by a need to escape a feeling of enstiflement, of stagnation. Theaim was to throw off the ‘habit neurosis’—the ‘habit of inferiority to one’sfull self’.But then, there is obviously an element of absurdity in deliberately seeking outdanger or discomfort, since we otherwise spend so much of our lives trying toavoid them. There must be other ways of breaking through to our vital reserves,apart from risking our necks or sleeping on a bed of nails. For example, it isplain that it is not the crisis itself that creates the flow of vital energy; itis our response to it. It is as if some inner-voice gave an order that causessomething inside us to snap to attention. Colonel Baird-Smith’s response to themutiny was to order himself to keep going, to ignore pain and starvation, untilthe crisis had been brought under control. The mutiny only instilled him with asense of the seriousness of the situation, to which his ‘vital reserves’responded. And if a man could generate that sense of seriousness, of the needfor effort, then he ought to be able to summon the energies without the need foran Indian mutiny.How is this to be done? According to Gurdjieff, the answer falls into two parts.First of all, a man must commit himself wholly and totally to the task ofescaping his normal limitations; it requires the kind of commitment that madesaints sit on top of pillars. Secondly, he must understand something of theworkings of this complicated computer that houses the human spirit. (Gurdjieffdied before the age of computers, so he used the word ‘machine’; but he wouldundoubtedly have found ‘computer’ more convenient and accurate.) ‘Understand themachine.’ This body is a computer; so is this brain. Like all computers, theyare capable of a far wider range of response than we ever demand of them. Butwider responses can only be obtained when they are thoroughly understood.Gurdjieff’s method of securing the first of these two objectives was simply todemand an unusual level of commitment. When the eleven-year-old Fritz Peterstold him that he wanted to know ‘everything about man’, Gurdjieff asked him withgreat intensity: ‘Can you promise to do something for me?’ When Peters said yes,Gurdjieff gestured at the vast expanse of lawns of the Chateau du Prieuré, andtold him that he must cut them all once a week.‘He struck the table with his fist for a second time. “You must promise on yourGod.” His voice was deadly serious. “You must promise me that you will do thisthing no matter what happens ... Must promise you will do no matter whathappens, no matter who try to stop you.”’ And Peters adds: ‘I would have died,if necessary, in the act of mowing the lawns.’ In fact, Gurdjieff then made himwork harder and harder, until he was mowing all the lawns in four days.The principle here is similar to that of commando training: that is, the traineeis made to tackle more and more difficult obstacles, until he can cascade downcliffs on his back and eat barbed wire for breakfast. This was the basis ofGurdjieff’s method. But it was not simply a matter of developing strength andalertness. Hard work can become a mere habit, like any other. Gurdjieff’s aimwas also to persuade his pupils not to develop habits. Habit arises from doingsomething mechanically, with the mind ‘elsewhere’. Gurdjieff’s pupils were madeto work hard; but it was important that they should maintain ‘mindfulness’,intense awareness.At some fairly early stage in his career—which we shall consider at greaterlength in the next chapter—Gurdjieff became acquainted with certain types ofeastern dancing that demanded an extraordinary complexity of movements. Anyonewho tries patting the head with one hand and rubbing the stomach with the otherwill know how difficult it is. Gurdjieff devised dances in which the student hadto do something not only with both hands, but with both feet and the head aswell. Again, these dances became fundamental to training in ‘the work’. Theiraim was to widen and extend the range of the body’s possibilities—what Gurdjieffcalled ‘the moving centre’. It is true that these dances (or ‘movements’) could,in themselves, become habitual. But, under certain circumstances, they couldalso be amazingly effective in producing new modes of consciousness. One of themost striking examples is to be found in J.G. Bennett’s autobiography Witness,describing Bennett’s experiences with Gurdjieff at Fontainebleau (the Prieuré)in 1923.Bennett was suffering from dysentery, contracted in the east.> Each morning, it was harder and harder to get out of bed, and my body shrank> from the heavy work in the heat of the sun. The constant diarrhoea made me> very weak, but somehow I kept going.> > Finally, a day came when I simply could not stand up. I was shaking with fever> and very wretched in myself; feeling that I had failed. Just as I was saying> to myself: ‘I will stay in bed today,’ I felt my body rising. I dressed and> went to work as usual, but this time with a queer sense of being held together> by a superior Will that was not my own.> > We worked as usual all the morning. I could not eat lunch that day, but lay on> the ground, wondering if I was going to die. Gurdjieff had just introduced> afternoon practices of the exercises out-of-doors under the lime grove. When> the pupils began to collect under the lime trees I joined them.> > We started by working on a new exercise of incredible complexity that even the> most experienced Russian pupils could not master. The structure of the> exercises was drawn on the board in symbols, and head, feet, arms and torso> had to follow independent sequences. It was a torture for all of us.> > Soon I ceased to be aware of anything but the music and my own weakness. I> kept saying to myself: ‘At the next change I will stop.’ ... One by one, all> the English pupils fell out, and most of the Russian women ...> > Gurdjieff stood watching intently. Time lost the quality of before and after.> There was no past and no future, only the present agony of making my body> move. Gradually I became aware that Gurdjieff was putting all his attention on> me. There was an unspoken demand that was at the same time an encouragement> and a promise. I must not give up—if it killed me.> > Suddenly, I was filled with the influx of an immense power. My body seemed to> have turned into light. I could not feel its presence in the usual ways. There> was no effort, no pain, no weariness, not even any sense of weight ... My own> state was blissful beyond anything I had ever known.> > It was quite different from the ecstasy of sexual union, for it was altogether> free and detached from the body. It was exultation in the faith that can move> mountains.> > All had gone into the house for tea, but I went in the opposite direction> towards the kitchen garden, where I took a spade and began to dig. Digging in> the earth is a searching test of our capacity for physical effort. A strong> man can dig very fast for a short time or slowly for a long time, but no one> can force his body to dig fast for a long time even if he has exceptional> training. I felt the need to test the power that had entered me, and I began> to dig in the fierce afternoon heat for more than an hour at a rate that I> ordinarily could not sustain for two minutes. My weak, rebellious, suffering> body had become strong and obedient. The diarrhoea had ceased and I no longer> felt the gnawing abdominal pains that had been with me for days. Moreover, I> experienced a clarity of thought that I had only known involuntarily and at> rare moments ... The phrase ‘in my mind’s eye’ took on a new meaning as I> ‘saw’ the eternal pattern of each thing I looked at, the trees, the water> flowing in the canal and even the spade, and lastly my own body ... I remember> saying aloud: ‘Now I see why God hides Himself from us.’ But even now I cannot> recall the intuition behind this exclamation.Bennett went for a walk in the forest, and encountered Gurdjieff, who began tospeak about man’s need for ‘higher emotional energy’ if he is to transformhimself. He went on: ‘There are some people in the world, but they are veryrare, who are connected to a Great Reservoir or Accumulator of this energy ...Those who can draw upon it can be a means of helping others.’ The implicationwas clearly that Gurdjieff himself was such a person, and that he had ‘supplied’Bennett with the necessary energy for his mystical experience. He added: ‘Whatyou have received today is a taste of what is possible for you. Until now youhave only known about these things theoretically, but now you have experience.’Bennett walked on into the forest; the most important part of his experience wasstill to come.> A lecture of Ouspensky came into my mind. He had spoken about the very narrow> limits within which we can control our functions and added: ‘It is easy to> verify that we have no control over our emotions. Some people imagine that> they can be angry or pleased as they will, but anyone can verify that he> cannot be astonished at will.’ As I recalled these words, I said to myself: ‘I> will be astonished.’ Instantly, I was overwhelmed with amazement, not only at> my own state, but at everything that I looked at or thought of. Each tree was> so uniquely itself that I felt that I could walk in the forest for ever and> never cease from wonderment. Then the thought of ‘fear’ came to me. At once I> was shaking with terror. Unnamed horrors were menacing me on every side.> > I thought of ‘joy’, and I felt that my heart would burst from rapture. The> word ‘love’ came to me, and I was pervaded with such fine shades of tenderness> and compassion that I saw that I had not the remotest idea of the depth and> the range of love. Love was everywhere and in everything. It was infinitely> adaptable to every shade of need. After a time, it became too much for me, it> seemed that if I plunged any more deeply into the mystery of love, I would> cease to exist. I wanted to be free from this power to feel whatever I chose,> and at once it left me.Bennett obviously attached great importance to Gurdjieff’s remarks on ‘the GreatReservoir or Accumulator’. But to someone trying to understand the essence ofGurdjieff’s ideas, this is less important than the simple fact that Bennett hadachieved such total control over his emotions. For this is our central humanproblem: that we are almost constantly the victims of our emotions, always beingswept up and down on a kind of inner-switchback. We possess a certain controlover them; we can ‘direct our thoughts’—or feelings—in such a way as tointensify them. This is certainly our most remarkable human characteristic:imagination. Animals require actual physical stimuli to trigger theirexperience. A man can retreat into a book—or a daydream—and live through certainexperiences quite independent of the physical world. He can even, for example,imagine a sexual encounter, and not only experience all the appropriate physicalresponses, but even the sexual climax. Such a curious ability is far beyond thepower of any animal.Yet our experience of imagination convinces us that it is bound, by its verynature, to be no more than a dim carbon copy of ‘real’ experience. And theconsequences of this unconscious assumption are far greater than we realize. Itmeans that we assume that the world of mind is very much a second best whencompared with the world of physical actuality, a kind of sham, a make-believe.So when confronted by some painful emotion, or some physical problem, ournatural tendency is to retreat and surrender. We are subject to arrest, not onlyfrom degrees of fatigue that we have come to obey by habit, but from degrees ofself-pity and boredom. Bennett’s experience suggests that, if only we made theeffort, we could achieve a degree of control over our feelings that would atpresent strike us as miraculous. The novelist Proust experienced, for a fewseconds, an intense consciousness of the reality of his own past—he describes itin Swann’s Way—and he spent the remainder of his life trying to rediscover thatcurious power. Yet such a glimpse would have been a mere by-product of the kindof control that Bennett experienced. To actually know this consciously, torealize that we were not intended to reach breaking point so quickly and easily,would obviously alter a man’s whole approach to his life and its problems.To effect such an alteration in human consciousness was Gurdjieff’s central aim."},{"pageContent":"2—THE EARLY YEARSWho was this man whose air of concentrated power impressed so many of hiscontemporaries?One of the first published accounts of Gurdjieff is to be found in a book byJ.G. Bennett, What Are We Living For?, which appeared in 1949, the year ofGurdjieff’s death. Bennett says: ‘To those who take an interest in such thingsit has been known for many years that a remarkable teacher had come to the Westin the person of a man reputed to have gained access to sources of knowledgedenied to any previous western explorer.’ He went on:> Gurdjieff has passed his eighty-third birthday ... He was born in the> Caucasus, of an old Greek family which migrated more than a hundred years ago> from one of the ancient Greek colonies of Asia Minor. From his early childhood> he had opportunities of meeting with a series of remarkable men, from contact> with whom he acquired the conviction that something of vital importance was> missing from the views about man and the world current in the European science> and literature he had been set to study.In fact, Gurdjieff was nowhere near the age of eighty-three when he died. Hispassport gave the date of his birth as 28 December 1877; if this is accurate,then he died shortly before his seventy-second birthday. In The Occult, I haveaccepted what seems to me the likelier date of 1873. The date makes a slightdifference as far as Gurdjieff’s nationality is concerned; if he was born in1873, then he was a Turkish citizen; if in December 1877, then he was a Russian,since his place of birth, Gumru, fell to the Russians during the Russo-Turkishwar of 1877; it was renamed Alexandropol, after the Tsar’s father.Gurdjieff’s father was Greek; his mother Armenian. Around 1878, the family movedto the nearby town of Kars; this had been taken by the Russians in 1877, andmany of the Turkish inhabitants had been massacred. When Kars became part ofRussia, thousands of Turks moved out and thousands of Russians moved in. It isimportant to realize that Gurdjieff was born into an ethnic melting pot; thatis, into the reverse of a secure and settled culture. Conditions like these cancreate a sense of rootlessness and insecurity; they can also stimulate the willto survive. Gurdjieff was a born survivor.His father was a carpenter by profession, a ‘bard’ or professional story-tellerby choice. From the beginning Gurdjieff had a deep sense of kinship with thepast. His father recited parts of the Epic of Gilgamesh. One day, Gurdjieff readin a magazine that archaeologists had discovered ancient tablets of the Epic inBabylonia, and he speaks of experiencing ‘such an inner excitement that it wasas if my future destiny depended on all this.’ He was impressed that the versesof the epic, as printed in the magazine, were almost identical to those hisfather had recited; yet they had been passed on by word of mouth for thousandsof years. What matters here is the unstated implication: that in that case,other kinds of ancient knowledge may have also survived in the same way.Like most children, Gurdjieff was fascinated by the world of the ‘occult’ andparanormal; but, unlike most children, he also had a certain amount of directexperience in this field. At the house of his tutor, Father Bogachevsky,Gurdjieff watched a ‘table rapping’ session, in which the table tapped outanswers to questions with one of its legs. Gurdjieff was still grief-strickenabout the death of a favourite sister, and spent the whole of that night awake,puzzling about the problem of life after death. When Gurdjieff asked his firstteacher, Father Borsch, about such matters, Borsch asserted that it was allnonsense; as a result, Gurdjieff found himself doubting the word of a man whomhe had previously regarded as the incarnation of wisdom. He borrowed books onthe subject, but found no satisfactory answer.He was also intrigued when a half-witted fortune teller told his aunt that hewould have a bad sore on his right side, and would have an accident with afirearm. In fact, the sore had been troubling him for some time, but he had toldno one about it. A week later, when he was out duck shooting, Gurdjieff was shotin the leg. As a result, Gurdjieff himself consulted the fortune teller, who satbetween two lighted candles and stared for a long time at his thumb nail—inwhich he saw ‘pictures’. These prophecies were also fulfilled, althoughGurdjieff does not tell us what they were.In 1888, Gurdjieff heard the sound of a child screaming; he found that a groupof children had drawn a circle around a Yezidi boy (the Yezidis were a religioussect, generally regarded as devil worshippers), and the boy was unable to breakhis way out of it. As soon as Gurdjieff rubbed out a part of the circle, thechild was able to escape. Gurdjieff was fascinated; he went from person toperson, asking what the phenomenon could mean. One man told him the children hadbeen playing a joke on him, another that it was simply a form of hysteria. Inlater years, Gurdjieff tried the experiment with a Yezidi woman; when a circlewas drawn round her, she could not move outside it, and it took Gurdjieff andanother strong man to drag her out. Gurdjieff also confirmed that when a Yezidiis dragged out of a circle, he falls into a state of catalepsy, which disappearsif he is placed inside again. Otherwise, says Gurdjieff, it vanishes afterthirteen or twenty-one hours.One morning, Gurdjieff saw a group of women talking excitedly, and learned fromthem that a young man who had been buried the day before—under a light coveringof earth, according to the Tartar custom—had tried to walk home in the night.Someone had seen him and raised the alarm; neighbours had cut the throat of thecorpse and carried it back to the cemetery. (Stories of vampires are current inthis part of the world.) Again, Gurdjieff questioned everyone he knew about whatit could mean.Accompanying a group of pilgrims from Alexandropol, to the tomb of a saint onMount Djadjur, Gurdjieff saw a paralytic crawl on to the tomb of the saint, andthen walk away cured. He was equally fascinated when, during a long drought, apriest from Antioch brought a miracle-working icon, and prayed for rain. As theprocession was marching back to the town, clouds gathered, and the rain poureddown.In the house next to Gurdjieff, a young married woman was dying of ‘gallopingconsumption’. One morning, just after a doctor had been telling Gurdjieff thatthe woman would soon be dead, her mother-in-law came to ask permission to gatherrose hips in the garden. The Virgin had appeared to her in a dream and told herto boil rose hips in milk and give them to the dying woman. The doctor laughed.But the next morning, Gurdjieff met the ‘dying’ woman coming out of church; aweek later, she was completely cured. The doctor explained that all this waspurely a matter of chance.It looks as if, on the whole, Gurdjieff encountered rather more than his fairshare of such odd events as a child and teenager—as if fate intended to steerhis highly active intelligence in a definite direction. His family wanted him tobecome a priest. His first ‘tutor’, Father Borsch, Dean of the Kars MilitarySchool (and, in effect, ‘bishop’ of the whole region), insisted that priestsshould also have a certain medical knowledge, since they may be wasting theirtime trying to cure the soul if the illness lies in the body. Gurdjieff himselfhad a natural inclination for handicrafts—he enjoyed tinkering with things,taking them to pieces and mending them, repairing household articles that hadbeen broken. He used to earn himself pocket money by travelling to Alexandropoland undertaking various repairs. (He went there from shame; he wanted no one inKars to realize how poor they were.) So his time was divided between theology,medicine, and crafts like shoe repairing or clock mending.Dean Borsch seems to have laid the foundation of Gurdjieff’s life-work withremarks about the general ‘laws’ of human nature. He pointed out, for example,that many adults fail to grow up because they lack the ‘corresponding type ofthe opposite sex’ for their completion. If a person fails to find his or her owntype, he is likely to end up with a second-best, who prevents his individualityfrom maturing. As a result, said the Dean, it is absolutely essential for eachperson to have beside him the person of the corresponding type of the oppositesex if he is to realize his possibilities. The comment sounds as if it mighthave been derived from Plato or Goethe, but the Dean attributed it to ‘ourremote ancestors’—so that, again, it sounded like a piece of ancient wisdom thathad been transmitted by word of mouth.In his early teens—Gurdjieff is never specific about dates—he took a job as astoker in the railway station at Tiflis. He also formed his first importantfriendship with someone his own age: a theological student named SarkisPogossian, son of a Turkish dyer. According to Gurdjieff, he travelled toEchmiadzin, the Armenian equivalent of Mecca, hoping to find an answer to thosequestions about the supernatural that were tormenting him. He carried with him aparcel for the young novice, who invited him to share his room.At this time, Gurdjieff’s own orientation was basically religious; he describesvisiting all the places of pilgrimage and praying at shrines. (It is importantto realize that, under different circumstances, Gurdjieff might have ended as anarchimandrite of the Greek orthodox church—or as a highly unorthodox religiousteacher like Rasputin.) Later, Pogossian—now on the verge of becoming apriest—came to stay with Gurdjieff in Tiflis. The thought of the priesthooddepressed Pogossian, and when Gurdjieff suggested that he should take a job atthe station, he immediately agreed—becoming a locksmith. At this point,Gurdjieff spent several months helping to survey the route of a proposed railwaybetween Tiflis and Kars. He supplemented his income by approaching the leadingmen in towns or villages through which the railway was scheduled to pass, andoffering to ‘fix’ a halting place there. Most of them paid the bribes.Back in Tiflis, he had enough money to give up his job on the railway and spendhis days reading. In long discussions, he and Pogossian had reached theconclusion that there was some ‘hidden knowledge’ that had come down fromancient times. They had bought piles of old Armenian texts from a localbookseller; now they moved to the ruins of the ancient Armenian capital, Ani,built a hut there, and spent their days in study and discussion.It must be emphasized that Gurdjieff owed his freedom to take such decisions tothe unsettled character of life in that region after the Russo-Turkish war. Ifhe and Pogossian had been born in St Petersburg or Constantinople, they wouldhave found it difficult to avoid being ingested by the ‘system’ and taking up arespectable profession. In the Asiatic equivalent of the American wild west,nobody cared too much if they ignored their families’ plans and pursued strangeideas of their own.So Gurdjieff and Pogossian were able to spend their days talking, and pokingaround in the ruins of the ancient city. One day, exploring an undergroundpassage, they uncovered a monk’s cell, with some decaying parchments written inancient Armenian. They returned to Alexandropol to decipher these manuscripts.They turned out to be letters to a certain Father Arem. And one of them referredto certain ‘mysteries’; the postscript spoke of a ‘Sarmoung Brotherhood’ whichused to exist at the town of Siranoush; they recognized the name as that of anesoteric brotherhood that, according to one of their books, dated back as far as2500 B.C. They decided that the parchments dated back to the seventh centuryA.D., that a city called Nivssi referred to in the parchment was present dayMosul, and that the descendants of the Sarmoung Brotherhood were the present dayAïsors. The manuscript stated that the secret school had moved to a valley threedays journey from Nivssi. This was not too far away—a few hundred miles duesouth—and Gurdjieff and Pogossian decided it might be worth seeing whether anytraces of the ancient school still existed. All they needed was finance for theexpedition, and this was provided by a local committee of Armenian patriots, whohad decided to send an expedition to a place called Moush. Pogossian persuadedthem to appoint himself and Gurdjieff their representatives; and so Gurdjieffset off on his first journey in search of ‘secret knowledge’.Unfortunately, Gurdjieff preferred not to be specific about what he learned. Hetells us (in Meetings With Remarkable Men) that he and Pogossian went south,disguising themselves for much of the journey as Caucasian Tartars. (They heardrumours that Englishmen had been flayed alive by Aïsors for trying to copyinscriptions.) At one point, Pogossian was bitten by a poisonous spider;Gurdjieff cut out the poison with a knife but the wound festered. An Armenianpriest, to whom they had to deliver a letter, put them up in his house for amonth. He told Gurdjieff a story about an old map he possessed—a Russian princehad offered to buy it for £500, and had finally paid £200 in order to be allowedto copy it. Gurdjieff asked to see the map, and was immensely excited to findthat it was an ancient map of Egypt. When the priest was out, he and Pogossianmanaged to get hold of the map and copied it—Gurdjieff admits that it wasimmoral, but felt it was necessary. Later, at Smyrna, Gurdjieff and Pogossiangot involved in a brawl between two groups of sailors, and both received minorinjuries. The next day, at the harbour, they were recognized by the gratefulsailors, who proved to be English. When they learned that Gurdjieff andPogossian wanted to get to Alexandria, two of them went off to try and arrangeit. The consequence was that Gurdjieff and Pogossian sailed on an Englishwarship to Egypt, Gurdjieff polishing the brass while Pogossian worked in theengine room. Pogossian decided to go on to Liverpool with the ship, where hebecame an engineer; Gurdjieff went to Egypt, then on to Jerusalem, where hebecame a professional guide to Russian tourists. But we are not told whether heand Pogossian found their Sarmoung Brotherhood, or whether Gurdjieff madeimportant discoveries by means of his map of ‘pre-sand Egypt’. But he does tellof a curious coincidence. Sitting at the foot of one of the pyramids—this washis second visit to Egypt—looking at his copy of the map, he looked up toobserve a grey haired man standing over him; the man asked, in great excitement,where Gurdjieff had obtained the map. He turned out to be the prince who hadpaid the Armenian priest £200 to copy it; his name was Prince Yuri Lubovedsky.He and Gurdjieff became close friends.Bennett believes that Gurdjieff eventually found his Sarmoung Brotherhood—or itsmodern descendants. Bennett himself tracked down the ‘valley three days ridefrom Nivssi’, and concluded it was a place called Sheik Adi, chief sanctuary ofthe Yezidis. Gurdjieff also mentions that the Brotherhood had a centre in the‘Olman’ monastery in the northern Himalayas, where, he says, he spent threemonths. And it seems possible that it was there that Gurdjieff eventuallydiscovered the secrets that he would one day pass on to his pupils.In case the reader is, by this time, beginning to entertain the impression thatGurdjieff may have been a great leg-puller, and that he invented the amazingstory of his ‘search for truth,’ let me cite an anecdote that demonstrates hispossession of esoteric knowledge. In Meetings With Remarkable Men, he tells thestory of his acquaintance with a talented Russian girl, Vitvitskaia. She toldGurdjieff how she had always been fascinated by the effect of music, believingthat it produces its impressions by means of vibrations, which somehow act uponthe biological vibrations of our bodies. In an Afghan monastery she learned howto produce certain effects on an audience by playing definite notes on thepiano. Gurdjieff himself was able to confirm some of her theories by telling howhe had seen, among the Essenes, a plant made to grow from its seed in half anhour by means of ancient Hebrew music.In his Childhood With Gurdjieff, Fritz Peters tells how a Russian family came tothe Prieuré. Gurdjieff told his followers that he could see that their daughterwas susceptible to definite musical chords, and that if a certain chord wasplayed, she would fall into a trance. The unsuspecting girl came into the room;Gurdjieff asked his pianist, Hartmann, to play the piano. As he played thestated chord, the girl fainted, and it took a long time to revive her. Gurdjieffpersuaded her to repeat the demonstration several times; on each occasion,Peters noticed her bewilderment and hysteria on waking up, and was convincedthat there was no possibility of collusion.This, then, was the kind of knowledge Gurdjieff was seeking—a knowledge thatwould bring power over people. But he was not interested in the power for itsown sake. He wanted to know why a Yezidi boy could be confined within a ‘magiccircle’, why a certain chord could send a girl into a trance. Vitvitskaiarevealed part of the answer when she told Gurdjieff about the secrets she hadlearned from the ‘Monopsyche Brethren’. ‘It cannot be denied that when thepeople present corresponded absolutely to the mentioned conditions, I could callforth at will in all of them laughter, tears, malice, kindness, and so on ... ’That is, their emotions could be triggered, as if they were machines. This wasperhaps the most important single conviction that Gurdjieff gained from hisstudy of esoteric religions: that man is almost entirely mechanical. He believesthat he ‘lives’ because he laughs, cries, gets angry, feels sorrow. In fact,says Gurdjieff, such reactions are little more than computerized responses tocertain definite stimuli, mere reflexes. This is the meaning of the title of oneof Bennett’s books about Gurdjieff: Is There Life on Earth? The answer is: verylittle. Most of what we call life is mechanical response.But can we achieve a degree of freedom from our mechanisms? When people askedGurdjieff that question, he told them that they had just taken the mostimportant step towards developing free will.Vitvitskaia’s discovery about music clearly reveals that the ‘machine’ iscontrolled by vibrations—in this case, musical vibrations. And this insight wasconfirmed when Gurdjieff spent some time in a ‘Sarmoung’ monastery in Turkestan.He and his friend Soloviev were taken there blindfold, and had to swear thatthey would never reveal its whereabouts, even if they could guess it. ThereGurdjieff again saw Prince Lubovedsky—for the last time. Lubovedsky took him tothe Women’s Court in the monastery, to witness the sacred dances. There he saw anumber of peculiar ‘apparatuses’, whose purpose was to teach the priestesses thebasic postures of the sacred dances. Each apparatus, says Gurdjieff, consistedof a column standing on a tripod. From this column, in different places, thereprojected seven ‘branches’ or arms. Each arm, in turn, was divided in sevenparts, the individual parts connected together by ball-and-socket joints, like aman’s shoulder joint. There was also a cupboard full of plates, each onecontaining a mysterious inscription. These inscriptions were instructions foraltering the position of the ‘arms’. The positions were the basic alphabet ofvarious postures and movements of the sacred dances. Gurdjieff says that when hesaw these dances, ‘I was astounded, not by the sense and meaning contained intheir dances, which I did not as yet understand, but by the external precisionand exactitude with which they performed them.’ These dances were obviously thebasis of the movements he taught his pupils. (Having seen them performed byBennett’s pupils at Sherborne House in Gloucestershire, I can confirm that theirprecision and exactitude rivet the attention, producing a strange aestheticeffect.)But the point to note here is the number of the arms and their segments—seventimes seven. As we shall see, the technical aspect of Gurdjieff’s teachingdepends on the notion of ‘octaves’ (i.e. the seven notes of the scale, completedby a return to the first note.) He asserts that the universe consists of sevenlevels of creation, which are also seven levels of vibration. (This notion ofvibrations is central to Gurdjieff’s thinking.) Man is subject to the ‘law ofseven’. Man also has seven ‘minds’, or centres, of which the intellectual mindis the lowest—or at least, the clumsiest. (There is also a movingcentre—governing the body—an emotional centre, a sex centre, an instinctivecentre, and also a higher emotional and higher thinking centre.) He is alsosubject to another law, the law of three, which asserts that all action is theresult of three forces (and not, as science declares, of two.) The first twoforces, positive and negative, merely counterbalance one another; they require akind of kick from a third force. It seems plain that the tripod at the base ofthe column was intended to symbolize this law of three.In short, it looks as if Gurdjieff derived most of his important basicprinciples from the Sarmoung monasteries in which he was accepted as a pupil. Wemay say that his quest began in the underground monk’s cell in the ruined cityof Ani, and ended in the Sarmoung monastery in the Himalayas. Gurdjieff’saccount of his search is fragmentary, and sometimes confused. He states that hewas one of a group who called themselves ‘Seekers After Truth’, headed by PrinceLubovedsky; but the part played by these other ‘seekers’ in Meetings WithRemarkable Men seems to be minimal. But perhaps his most important pronouncementis one that occurs in his first book Herald of Coming Good, where he states thatafter spending some time in a Sufi monastery in central Asia, he came to theconclusion that the answers to his questions ‘can be found ... in the sphere ofman’s unconscious mentation’—meaning his unconscious mind. That is to say, thereal answers are already there, inside us, and can only be discovered by minuteself-observation, and by reasoning about and analysing what we observe.So for practical purposes, we may ignore the remainder of Gurdjieff’s ‘search’,which took him to various places in Asia. Meetings With Remarkable Men gives usa clear picture of these early days, but it should be read with caution. Onewhole section, describing how the ‘Seekers of Truth’ went in search of a lostcity in the Gobi desert (taking twenty-foot stilts with them so they could walkabove the sand storms) seems to be pure fiction—Bennett thinks it is probably anallegory of people who search for truth ‘out there’ instead of ‘in here’. Thereis no knowing how much of the book is invention. Its chief value lies in thefact that it is the most accessible and readable of Gurdjieff’s four books, andthat it gives us an excellent picture of Gurdjieff as a real human being. He isnever averse to describing the various dubious ways in which he made money—likecatching sparrows, dying them different colours, and selling them as ‘Americancanaries’. And his stories of his various companions—even of his dog—show him tohave been a generous and warm-hearted man, a view confirmed by all who knew himwell. But it seems unlikely that we shall ever know precisely what Gurdjieff didbetween 1891, when he set out on his adventures (either at the age of fourteenor nineteen, depending which date of birth we accept) until about 1910, when hefirst appears in Moscow and St Petersburg as a teacher of self-knowledge. Itseems fairly certain there was an intervening period when Gurdjieff became aprofessional hypnotist and wonder worker—what his critics would doubtlessdescribe as a charlatan. In the Ekim Bey chapter of Meetings With RemarkableMen, he describes how he and Ekim Bey (the man who taught him about hypnotism)earned some badly-needed money in Tashkent by hiring a hall and putting on a‘magical’ show of hypnotism and other phenomena. An extraordinary photograph inBennett’s Gurdjieff: Making a New World shows a young Gurdjieff (with hair) ‘asProfessional Hypnotist’, standing against some kind of a stage backdrop andlooking like the villain in a Victorian pantomime. Bennett surmises thatGurdjieff’s ‘professional’ period lasted from about 1907 until 1910.But the most important event of these early years occurred around 1904, near atown on the edge of the Gobi desert; it is described in his last book Life IsReal Only Then, When ‘I Am’. Gurdjieff’s health had been breaking down for sometime—in fact, since the year 1896, when he had been hit by a stray bullet on theisland of Crete, then decided to walk back to Russia. In 1902, a second ‘straybullet’ brought him close to death; he was unconscious for three months at aplace on the edge of the Gobi desert, near Yangihissar. Two years later, he madethe mistake of getting between the Tsar’s soldiers and a group ofrevolutionaries; a third stray bullet again came close to ending his life. By anodd coincidence, he again found himself convalescing in the same place on theedge of the Gobi desert.One evening, when he was physically recovered, Gurdjieff lay in the moonlight,thinking over the past few years. His reflections plunged him into gloom; infact, his own shortcomings struck him as so appalling that he experienced asense of total worthlessness. The negative current of his thought was sopowerful that he was unable to shake himself free; he felt he was about to loseconsciousness when the movement of the camels distracted him and enabled him tothrow off this ‘dark night of the soul’. Lying next to a spring, he began aprocess of self-examination. It seemed that the various ‘powers’ he had acquiredin the past few years had been used for the gratification of his worst impulses,self-love, vanity, pride, sexual lust. According to Gurdjieff, his powers ‘hadbeen brought to such a level that by only a few hours of self-preparation Icould from a distance of ten miles kill a yak; or, in twenty-four hours, couldaccumulate life forces of such compactness that I could in five minutes put tosleep an elephant.’ Yet in spite of these semi-magical powers, he still felthimself to be little better than a machine. He was still unable to maintain astate of self-remembering (intense self-awareness) for more than a few seconds.What could he do to increase his self-awareness, to galvanize his inner beingwith a sense of urgency? The saints of old tried sleeping on beds of nails andwearing hair shirts; Gurdjieff had also tried such ‘mechanical’ disciplines, andfound them insufficient. The only way, he decided, was to make some enormoussacrifice. (An inveterate smoker might, for example, give up tobacco, so thatthe misery of his deprivation would continually serve as a kind of ‘alarmclock’.) What could he sacrifice? ‘Thinking and thinking, I came to theconclusion that if I should intentionally stop utilizing the exceptional powerin my possession ... then there must be forced out of me such a remindingsource.’ In short, he would sacrifice his powers of hypnotism and telepathy.‘As soon as I realized the sense of this idea, I was as if reincarnated; I gotup and began to run around the spring ... like a young calf.’Gurdjieff thereupon took an oath never again to use his powers merely forself-gratification—only for ‘scientific’ purposes.It was at this point that he ceased to be a mere ‘magician’—like hiscontemporary Aleister Crowley—and became primarily a teacher. It was thebeginning of a new era in his life."},{"pageContent":"3—MOSCOW AND ST PETERSBURGIn the year 1909, Gurdjieff decided that it was time to embark on his new careeras a teacher. The reason, he explains in his first book, Herald of Coming Good,was that ‘there was, among men, a widely prevalent ... psychosis’, known asoccultism or spiritualism. He was, at this period, in Tashkent (now in SovietCentral Asia). There, as in Moscow and St Petersburg, there was a feverishinterest in all forms of occultism and mysticism, in the doctrines of MadameBlavatsky and Rudolf Steiner, in seances and table-rapping and spirit-healing.And no doubt Gurdjieff reflected that he knew more about ‘hidden knowledge’ thanall the fashionable occultists and mystics put together.At all events, he began to frequent spiritualist and theosophical circles. Hesays:> The ensuing circumstances of my life were so favourable to me that, within six> months, I succeeded not only in coming into contact with a great number of> these people, but even in being accepted as a well-known ‘expert’ and guide in> evoking so-called ‘phenomena of the beyond’ in a very large circle.In a short time, he says, he was regarded as a great maestro of all supernaturalknowledge. He speaks frankly of his ‘skill in producing tricks’, so it seemslikely that not all the ‘psychic manifestations’ he obtained were genuine. Hisaim, at this point, was to form a circle of disciples who were genuinely insearch of power over themselves—not the kind of hysterical enthusiasts who wereat that time following Rasputin in St Petersburg. His aim, he explains, was tobe able to ‘put into the lives of people what I had already learned.’ That is tosay, he wanted to put his ideas to the test. He regarded his students as ‘guineapigs’.His success was apparently very considerable—so much so that he ended byorganizing no less than three groups in three different cities—he does notspecify which these were. We know nothing of Gurdjieff at this period—none ofthe written accounts by disciples date back this far. Gurdjieff himself saysthat he decided to wind up his Tashkent venture because the people all tended tobelong to only three or four different types, and that he felt that genuinesuccess could only be obtained if his groups contained representatives of allhuman types. (He says there are twenty-eight.) So in the year 1912, he decidedto move to Russia.The move may have been decided as a result of a decision he took on 13 September1911—he gives the exact date in Herald of Coming Good. On this date, he says, hetook an oath to spend the next twenty-one years leading ‘in some ways anartificial life, modelled upon a programme which had previously been planned inaccordance with certain definite principles.’What exactly did he mean by ‘an artificial life’? Bennett rightly says that mostof the people who met Gurdjieff felt that he was in some way ‘hiding himself’.People who came to know him well—insofar as anyone ever did—had the feeling thathe was acting a part, never responding to people in a direct and spontaneousmanner. Yet disciples like Ouspensky had no doubt that this was not because hehad anything to hide. It was because he felt that he could only achieve certainresults by approaching his pupils in an objective manner, as a doctor approachesthe patient, and aiming to produce certain effects on them. (Modernpsychologists do this a great deal—perhaps telling their subjects that they willexperience a certain response, to see whether they will convince themselves thatthey have received a non-existent stimulus. Lying to the subject is an essentialpart of such an experiment.) After two years of ‘teaching’ in Tashkent,Gurdjieff may have felt that a new relationship to his pupils was necessary: notthat of Master and disciples, but something closer to a scientist and hisassistants.In addition to organizing his groups, Gurdjieff was also engaged in manybusiness enterprises: he lists government contracts for supplying andconstructing railways and roads, dealing in cattle (as his father had before hebecame a carpenter), and running stores, restaurants and cinemas. He alsocarried on a trade in carpets and antiques. In 1912; he sold his variousbusinesses, realizing more than a million roubles, and moved to Moscow. There hepurchased an estate, and prepared to set up his Institute for the HarmoniousDevelopment of Man.Historically speaking, he was unlucky. He had spent fifteen years seeking‘hidden knowledge’, and another three years making a fortune; now he was readyto launch his institute—to consolidate his life’s work—just at the time whenEurope was about to plunge into the most disastrous and widespread war of alltime. Gurdjieff was apparently unaware of the international situation; he latersaid that he chose Russia because it was ‘peaceful, rich and quiet’. His yearsin Asia and Africa had given him no inkling of what was to come.Bennett is convinced that Gurdjieff moved in court circles in these years andthat he met the Tsar. Certainly, he was the kind of person who might haveexerted a wholly beneficial influence on Russian politics in this period.Bennett suggests that he was associated with a moderate party surrounding theTsar and that he was ‘canvassed as a counter to the hated Rasputin’. The remarkshows a lack of knowledge of Russian politics during this period. Rasputinhimself had little or no influence over the Tsar at this period, although theTsarina continued to believe in him—his drunkenness and indiscretions had led tohis fall from favour. Insofar as Rasputin was an influence, it was forliberalism and reasonableness. (He made enormous exertions to dissuade the Tsarfrom going to war in 1914.) So there could be no question of Gurdjieff being a‘counter influence’. At all events, Gurdjieff was sufficiently close to thecourt to become acquainted with one of the Tsarina’s ladies in waiting, CountessOstrowska, whom he married.And now, at last, it becomes possible to draw upon first hand accounts ofmeetings with Gurdjieff. The earliest of these seems to be a ‘story’ or essaycalled ‘Glimpses of Truth’,1 written by one of Gurdjieff’s Moscow disciples in1914 (with Gurdjieff’s encouragement), and referring to the period whenGurdjieff first came to Moscow. The anonymous author tells how, at a certainperiod of his life, he became interested in occultism, no doubt reading books onthe Qabalah, the Tarot, and so on. He pursued his search with an enthusiasmwhich seems peculiarly Russian. (Berdyaev tells a story of how, at five o’clockin the morning, one member of a discussion group remarked: ‘We can’t go to bedyet—we haven’t decided whether God exists.’) A friend, whom he calls A., wasequally absorbed in the quest for esoteric knowledge. Then the friend seemed tolose interest; he had, unknown to the author, met Gurdjieff.One day, the writer noticed an advertisement in a Moscow newspaper for a balletcalled ‘The Struggle of the Magicians’. The author was named as G.I. Gurdjieff.When he mentioned this to A., his friend revealed—with some reluctance—that heknew Gurdjieff, and agreed to try and arrange a meeting.On a Sunday afternoon, A. rang up. ‘Be at the railroad at seven o’clock. We aregoing to see Mr Gurdjieff.’ The writer felt that this was inconvenient—he hadimportant business. But he decided to put it off, and arrived on time. Hisacquaintance was waiting, and they took a train to a ‘country resort nearMoscow’. On the way there, A. told him something about Gurdjieff—how he hadspent years wandering in the East, and had now decided to set up an Institutenear Moscow. This account also contains the inaccurate statement that Gurdjieffhad come to Russia two or three years earlier and lived in St Petersburg.Typically, Gurdjieff never corrected this, although he allowed ‘Glimpses ofTruth’ to circulate among his pupils.From the station, a sleigh drove them to the gates of a country house. They wentin the front door, passed through a completely dark antechamber, hung with heavycurtains, and came into a room where a middle-aged man was sitting on a lowottoman, smoking a water pipe.It is worth recounting these preliminaries, for they are, as we shall see,typical of Gurdjieff’s way of meeting prospective pupils—the abrupt telephonecall ‘Be at so and so.’ It was designed not so much to intrigue as to filter outthose who lacked enthusiasm and determination.Gurdjieff, says the writer, had an oriental complexion. ‘His eyes particularlyattracted my attention, not so much in themselves as by the way he looked at me,not as if he saw me for the first time, but as though he had known me long andwell.’ The walls and floor were covered with rare oriental carpets, and theceiling with beautiful silk shawls; the light came from a huge glass globeresembling a lotus flower. It sounds as if Gurdjieff was out to create thecorrect ‘mystical’ atmosphere. But his conversation turned out to be oddlyconcrete and down to earth—a fact that impressed most ‘seekers’ who met him. Hespoke Russian badly and hesitantly (his native languages being Greek andArmenian.)Gurdjieff began with a discourse on the Hermetic formula ‘As above, so below’,illustrating it with the life of man, then with the life of the earth itself,then moving to the solar system. He spoke of the Law of Three—the three forces,action, resistance and equipoise. All this, understandably, left the occultistslightly breathless.Gurdjieff continued with an outline of his basic ‘cosmological’ (as opposed topsychological) system. Since, in this book, I shall be more concerned withGurdjieff’s psychological ideas it will be convenient to offer a brief outlineof his cosmology at this point.According to Gurdjieff, the universe is a living organism, which consists ofseven levels, the highest of which is the supreme intelligence. These levels canbe thought of as a ladder down which energy is transmitted, changing its natureas it moves from level to level. In this sense, Gurdjieff’s scheme resemblesthat of the Qabalah, whose Tree of Life could also be thought of as a kind ofladder which winds and twists as it ascends from man (at the bottom) to God (atthe top). The ‘levels’, of course, are realms of spiritual reality, not physicalworlds. But because of the law ‘As above, so below’, they can be regarded asphysical worlds. For this reason, Gurdjieff identifies his seven levels withbodies in the universe: the moon, the earth, the planets, the sun, the galaxy,the totality of worlds, and the absolute. The moon is at the lowest level, andanyone who lives on that level is subject to no less than ninety-six laws. Menon earth are subject only to forty-eight laws. The planets are subject totwenty-four. The absolute is subject to only one law—its own. Gurdjieff callsthis scheme ‘the ray of creation’. Those who find it incomprehensible areadvised not to worry; the essence of Gurdjieff’s ideas can be grasped withoutit.Equally important in Gurdjieff’s cosmology is the notion of the notes of theoctave. This is, basically, the major law governing our human activity. Everyonemust have noticed that we seldom reach the long-term objectives we have set forourselves. We make some important resolution and decide to carry it out withdetermination, step by step. And for a short time, we carry on in an undeviatingstraight line towards our goal. And then, without noticing it, we lose thatoriginal drive, and change our direction slightly. Then later we again changeour direction. Sometimes we do this so often that we end up doing the exactreverse of what we set out to do. (This explains, for example, why so manyfighters for political freedom end up as bullies and tyrants.)The reason, says Gurdjieff, lies in the law of the octave. In terms ofvibrations, there are two places in the octave which are ‘weaker’ thanelsewhere—the space between Mi and Fa, and between Ti and Do; there aresemitones between these notes, instead of full tones. And where our energies areconcerned these are the points where, unless we are deliberately reinforced, wechange direction.Creative processes depend on descending octaves. For example, in writing thisbook, I began by contemplating the whole of Gurdjieff’s thought, and planning itinto seven chapters. If I had possessed some computer that could instantlytranslate my vision into words, this book could have been written in tenminutes. But after it had been subdivided into seven sections, I then had todecide what to put into each section and what to leave out. If the final versionof this book is anything at all like my original conception, it will only bebecause I have applied the law of octaves, and deliberately reinforced thatoriginal stimulus at certain definite points. That is, I have broken off, andcarefully re-thought what I was doing. Every writer—or artist or musician—isthoroughly familiar with the process I am describing. This is why a painterkeeps standing back to look at his canvas, then goes away to sleep on it andcomes back to it afresh the next day. A work of art cannot be created in onelong, continuous burst of application; if the artist ignores this rule, his workbecomes, quite literally broken backed. (This is why so many of Balzac’s novelsstart off so magnificently and end so badly.)All these laws are outlined to the author of ‘Glimpses of Truth’. After this,Gurdjieff explains that the body can be compared to a factory with threestories, the head, the chest and the abdomen. These function on different kindsof ‘food’. The stomach needs meat and drink; the chest needs air, while thebrain needs impressions. This was an important part of Gurdjieff’s doctrine—thatimpressions and experiences are just as much ‘food’ as bread is, and that wewould starve without them. Experiments in sensory deprivation, using a blackroom, have shown the literal truth of his observation; but in 1912, suchexperiments were unknown, and his assertion sounded bizarre and unfounded. It isone of many such examples of the startling accuracy of his insights. The threekinds of ‘food’, says Gurdjieff, belong to different octaves.He ended by telling the new disciple something about his ballet ‘The Struggle ofthe Magicians’, explaining that it was intended primarily to entertain, but thatit also contained certain sacred dances whose meanings related to the Law ofThree and the Law of Seven. (We have already seen how Gurdjieff learned aboutthese dances—and laws—in the Sarmoung monastery.) Gurdjieff was scathing aboutmost contemporary art, explaining that it is purely subjective, a merereflection of the neuroses of the individual artist. Objective art is adifferent matter, since it attempts to convey the same universal meaning to all.The ‘story’ ends with A. drawing the blinds, and revealing that it isdaylight—in fact, nine o’clock in the morning. Gurdjieff orders a carriage totake them both back to the station. And so the fragment breaks off.It was through ‘The Struggle of the Magicians’ that P. D. Ouspensky, Gurdjieff’smost influential exponent, became acquainted with the man to whose ideas he wasto devote the remainder of his life.Ouspensky, like Gurdjieff, was a seeker after ‘hidden knowledge’, and in 1914 hehad travelled to India in search of it. He met various teachers who offered toaccept him into their schools; but Ouspensky had no desire to settle in India.He returned to Moscow, where he saw a notice about ‘The Struggle of theMagicians’, and wrote an unfavourable comment on it for his newspaper. In thespring of 1915 Ouspensky gave several lectures about his search for ‘hiddenknowledge’ to St Petersburg audiences, and two acquaintances he made there toldhim about the Caucasian Greek who was responsible for ‘The Struggle of theMagicians’. Ouspensky was not impressed; Gurdjieff sounded like another mysticalcharlatan. His first meeting with him changed that impression, but still lefthim badly puzzled. He was introduced to Gurdjieff in a small café in a backstreet, ‘a man of an oriental type, no longer young [Gurdjieff was about 40]with a black moustache and piercing eyes, who astonished me because he seemed tobe disguised and completely out of keeping with the place and its atmosphere.’Gurdjieff spoke with a Caucasian accent—which, to a Russian, would sound ratheras a broad Lancashire accent to an Englishman—i.e. hardly associated withprofound or subtle ideas.They spoke of eastern philosophy and the ‘search for truth’, and Ouspenskyquickly realized that Gurdjieff was a man who had experienced most of the thingshe talked about. At this point, he invited Ouspensky to a meeting of some of hispupils. On the way there, he told Ouspensky of the immense expense he hadincurred in hiring the flat where the meeting took place. He also told Ouspenskythat many professors and artists in Moscow were interested in his ideas, butwhen Ouspensky pressed for names, was silent. They arrived at the flat andOuspensky was embarrassed to find that it was the kind of plain flat that wasgiven to schoolteachers—rent free. Why had Gurdjieff told him the story abouthis enormous expenses? It was as if Gurdjieff was deliberately trying to confirmOuspensky’s original impression that he was some kind of a confidence trickster.The ‘disciples’ seemed to be schoolteachers. One of them read aloud the‘Glimpses of Truth’ manuscript, which Ouspensky found confusing and badlywritten. He asked what system Gurdjieff’s pupils were studying, and was toldthat it was ‘work on oneself’. But there was no further elucidation. Moreover,Gurdjieff asked whether the story could be printed in a newspaper, and Ouspenskyhad to say no—it was too long and had no beginning and end. It sounded as ifGurdjieff was trying to use Ouspensky to get personal publicity.But later meetings in the same back street café left Ouspensky in no doubt thatGurdjieff possessed real knowledge. He told Ouspensky two things that instantlyimpressed him: that man is basically a machine, who merely responds to hisenvironment, and that we are mistaken to think that we possess an ego, anindividual ‘I’. We possess dozens of ‘I’s’, probably thousands. This is why itis so hard to work or behave consistently. One ‘I’ makes a new year’sresolution, but another ‘I’ takes over a few hours later and decides to breakit. This was the kind of down-to-earth psychology that appealed to Ouspensky’sbasically scientific outlook.When Gurdjieff told Ouspensky that his Moscow pupils paid a thousand roubles ayear, Ouspensky said it sounded a lot. At this, Gurdjieff explained that it wasimportant for his pupils to pay for what they received. First of all, people donot value what they receive too easily; second, people who could not find thatmuch money per year would probably be bad at ‘the work’; Gurdjieff emphasizedthat it is the competent, efficient people, not the neurotic dreamers, who cangenerate the power to change themselves.The turning point in their relationship occurred when Ouspensky asked: ‘Is itpossible to stop being a machine?’ Gurdjieff replied: ‘If you had asked suchquestions more often, we might, perhaps, have got somewhere in our talks. It ispossible to stop being a machine, but for that it is necessary first of all toknow the machine.’It might be said that Ouspensky had at last asked the right question. AndGurdjieff had given the right answer. From now on, Ouspensky was whollycommitted to learning what Gurdjieff had to teach.Man is in prison, said Gurdjieff. If he is to have a chance to escape, then hemust begin by realizing that he is in prison. Until he has reached this point,he cannot even begin. Then arises the question: how to escape? Here, Gurdjieffmade a statement that is also central to his work. A group of people stands abetter chance of escape than a single person, for they can collaborate on atunnel. A man on his own stands little chance. For man is basically asleep. Hethinks that his everyday consciousness is ‘waking consciousness’, as opposed tothe unconscious state he plunges into every night. This is perhaps his greatestmistake. In fact, when we wake up in the morning, we simply enter another formof sleeping consciousness. We merely react to circumstances, doing today what wedid yesterday and the day before. Various things can give us flashes of‘awakening’—a sudden crisis, the prospect of a need to change one’s whole modeof existence, even setting out on a journey or a holiday. A mother holding hernew baby for the first time may ‘wake up’ for a moment, and realize, in a flash,that the consciousness she accepts every day of her life is not necessary, thatlife could be completely different, far more fascinating and complex. In short,that she is free. But if, ten minutes later, she asks herself: ‘What is thisfreedom?’, she has already forgotten.It may make Gurdjieff’s approach easier to understand if, instead of speakingabout the ‘machine’, we use the term ‘robot’. I have a robot in my unconsciousmind who does things for me. When I learn to type, or drive a car, or learn aforeign language, I have to do it painfully and consciously, step by step. Soon,my robot-valet takes over from me, and types or drives much faster and moreefficiently than ‘I’ can. This robot is of incalculable importance. When I was achild, he was far less efficient, and as a result, I was clumsy, and everythingcost me far more effort. Now my robot takes most of the work of living off myshoulders.There is one problem. He not only does the things I want him to do—like typingand talking French. He also does things I don’t want him to do. I like music andpoetry; but when I hear a symphony or read a poem a dozen times or so, it loseshalf its impact because the robot is listening instead of me. If I ampreoccupied, he eats my dinner for me. He may even make love to my wife. I missa great deal of interesting and fresh experience because I have become toodependent on the robot.Plainly, Gurdjieff is talking about the robot, and our slavery to him. I can putthe robot out of action, so as to experience the ‘newness’ of things. A coupleof glasses of wine makes the robot relax. Psychedelic drugs like mescalin or LSDcompletely paralyse the robot, and the result is that the drug-taker isconfronted by a blaze of reality that dazzles him; a flower or a tree may seemso real that they arrest the attention, bursting with meaning.The trouble is that such drugs put the robot completely out of action. And thisis not what is required. For we developed the robot in the first place becausewe wanted more freedom. It is not good sense to paralyse him. In fact, in moodsof real freedom, the ‘real me’ and the robot seem to arrive at a perfect accord.William James remarks that a footballer may play the game superbly for years,yet one day, he breaks through some inner barrier, and suddenly he can’t put afoot wrong; the game seems to play him. Or a musician may suddenly find that heis playing his instrument with a curious perfection, with a degree of controlsuch as he has never achieved before. This, in fact, is what happened to JohnBennett in the woods at Fontainebleau—except that his ‘instrument’ was his ownbody, his own mind, which could suddenly conjure up any mood he wanted. And thiskind of freedom could not be achieved through a psychedelic drug. It requiresactive co-operation between ‘the real me’ and ‘the robot’. Every writer, forexample, knows that a glass of alcohol may remove his inhibitions and make himwrite more freely. Three or four glasses may produce a warm glow in which hefeels he can pour a masterpiece on to the typewriter. But when he reads what hehas written the next morning, it is nonsense. The wine had removed theinhibitions, but it had also removed the critical checks that select the rightword, the right expression. Alcohol is no substitute for the kind of hard workthat produces the sudden ‘break-through’, the perfect collaboration of criticismand inspiration, of robot and ‘real me’.Expressed in this way, we can begin to see what Gurdjieff was aiming at. We aretalking about William James’s ‘second wind’, about those curious influxes ofpower in which you feel more alive. How can we hope to produce these at will? Bynot doing things ‘automatically’, by not drifting through life with our eyesfixed on the outside world. The first step is to LOOK INSIDE, to observe thecomplex relationship between ‘real me’ and robot. This is not a way ofmeditation, or of mysticism, or of physical self-discipline. This is primarily away of knowledge, a way that depends on knowing certain definite things.1 Included in Views from the Real World, London 1973."},{"pageContent":"4—THE DELUGE AND AFTEREven in 1915, when he met Ouspensky, Gurdjieff must have realized that his plansfor an institute were in danger of collapse. Fortunately, he was not the kind ofperson to take it to heart. Comfort and security could be far more dangerousthan uncertainty—which has the advantage of keeping the mind alert. He continuedhis work with the various groups, but prepared to move on when the time came.The war always loomed over them. Ouspensky was particularly struck by the sightof a lorry loaded up with crutches, on its way to a military hospital—crutchesfor limbs that had not yet been blown off. Rival armies were responding topurely mechanical emotions of patriotism and indignation, and nothing could stopthem slaughtering one another. Ouspensky’s group in St Petersburg oftendiscussed the idea of Noah’s Ark—a ship that could survive the flood of comingevents, and carry its builders to safety.At this time, Gurdjieff was continuing to work in Moscow; members of Ouspensky’sgroup occasionally went there, and returned with notes of Gurdjieff’s latestlectures. The ‘work’ consisted basically of self-observation, based onGurdjieff’s teaching about the ‘centres’. The fundamental problem was how to‘remember oneself’. Our normal state of consciousness lacks a central ‘I’. WhenI open my eyes in the morning, things are ‘seen’, but it is not I who sees them;it is ‘the machine’, the robot. Ouspensky represented the concept with aconvenient diagram. When I pay attention to the external world, I am like anarrow pointing outwards. When I close my eyes and sink ‘into myself’, myattention becomes an arrow pointing inwards. Now if I try to do both at once—topoint the ‘arrow’ in and out at the same time—I immediately discover that thisis incredibly difficult. After a second or two, I either forget the outsideworld, and sink into a daydream, or forget ‘myself’ and become absorbed in whatI am looking at. Yet, said Gurdjieff, these moments of self-remembering, whenthe arrow points both ways at once, are the most important of our lives. In allmoments of deep happiness, we get a feeling that could be expressed: ‘What,me—here?’ I am not only aware of what is happening to me, but that it ishappening to me. One of Gurdjieff’s most basic exercises in the Moscow days wasto try to look at some object—say, a watch—and at the same time to become awareof yourself looking at it. His pupils soon began to realize the immensedifficulty of self-remembering.It is obvious, said Gurdjieff, that there is something badly wrong with man ashe exists at present. Why should we experience so much, only to forget itimmediately afterwards? Half our experience rolls off us like water off a duck’sback. Yet experience is food, whose purpose is to enable us to evolve.Ouspensky soon found that efforts at self-remembering could be tremendouslyworthwhile in this respect.> Thus, for instance, at that time I used very much to like to wander through St> Petersburg at night, and to ‘sense’ the houses and the streets. St Petersburg> is full of these strange sensations. Houses, especially old houses, were quite> alive; I all but spoke to them. There was no ‘imagination’ in it. I did not> think of anything, I simply walked along while trying to remember myself and> looked about; the sensations came by themselves.Ouspensky was experiencing the beginning of the sense of control that Bennettexperienced at Fontainebleau later.Ouspensky also has an amusing story about an unsuccessful attempt toself-remember.> I was once walking along the Liteiny towards the Nevsky, and in spite of all> my efforts I was unable to keep my attention on self-remembering. The noise,> movement, everything distracted me. Every minute I lost the thread of> attention, found it again, and then lost it again. At last I felt a kind of> ridiculous irritation with myself and I turned into the street on the left> having firmly decided to keep my attention on the fact that I would remember> myself at least for some time ... I reached the Nadejdinskaya without losing> the thread of attention, except, perhaps, for short moments. Then I again> turned towards the Nevsky realizing that, in quiet streets, it was easier not> to lose the line of thought and wishing therefore to test myself in more noisy> streets. I reached the Nevsky still remembering myself, and was already> beginning to experience the strange emotional state of inner peace and> confidence which comes after great efforts of this kind. Just round the corner> was a tobacconist’s shop where they made my cigarettes. Still remembering> myself I thought I would call there and order some cigarettes.> > Two hours later I woke up in the Tavricheskaya, that is, far away ... The> sensation of awakening was extraordinarily vivid. I can almost say that I came> to. I remembered everything at once. How I had been walking along the> Nadejdinskaya, how I had been remembering myself, how I had thought about> cigarettes, and how at this thought I seemed all at once to fall and disappear> into a deep sleep.> > At the same time, while immersed in this sleep, I had continued to perform> consistent and expedient actions ... And on the way while driving along the> Tavricheskaya, I began to feel a strange uneasiness, as though I had forgotten> something. And suddenly I remembered that I had forgotten to remember myself.This anecdote brings out a number of important points. First, the odd sense ofdeep satisfaction and control—and it could almost be compared to sexualsatisfaction—that accompanies self-remembering: the birth of a deeper and widerform of consciousness. Then it is worth noting that it was the thought ofcigarettes that plunged him into ‘sleep’. This explains why Gurdjieff felt it soimportant to deliberately give up certain old habits, so that the tensionthereby produced acts as an ‘alarm clock’. If Ouspensky had made a resolution tostop smoking, the thought of tobacco would have served as an additional ‘shock’to maintain his purpose, to strengthen the weak point of the ‘octave’.Lastly, we note that the realization that he had forgotten to remember himselfwas literally like waking up. Gurdjieff’s assertion that ordinary consciousnessis a form of sleep is not intended as a figure of speech; it should be takenliterally. On another occasion, Ouspensky describes how he achieved a state ofself-remembering so intense that as he walked along the street, he couldactually see that people were asleep, and see their heads wrapped in a kind ofcloud of dreams. Again, this should not be taken as a figure of speech.Self-remembering seems to bring about an odd form of ‘telepathy’, in whichconsciousness becomes aware of a far wider field of reality. It seems likelythat, in a sense, Ouspensky could literally see ‘into their heads’.As the winter of 1916 dragged on, it became clear to Ouspensky that their ‘Ark’was not going to protect them from the chaos that surrounded them. Just afterChristmas that year, the Tsarina’s favourite, Rasputin, disappeared; he hadprophesied that if he was killed by peasants, Russia would remain prosperous forhundreds of years; but if it was by the aristocracy, then the royal family wouldbe doomed and no nobles would remain in Russia. He was murdered by Prince FelixYussupov, and his body was recovered from the Neva a few weeks later.Gurdjieff went back to Alexandropol, his home town, and telegraphed Ouspensky tojoin him there. Ouspensky was intrigued by this glimpse of Gurdjieff’sbackground, and particularly by an enlarged photograph showing a youngerGurdjieff in a frock coat. From this, says Ouspensky, he deduced whatGurdjieff’s profession had been at the time, but has decided to keep the secretto himself. This was, of course, the ‘hypnotist’ photograph (reproduced byBennett in Gurdjieff: Making a New World).Ouspensky was puzzled. Gurdjieff seemed to be working well, unperturbed byhistorical events. He told Ouspensky he felt things would soon quieten down andhe would be able to continue his work in Russia. (If he was serious—which issomething one can never be sure about with Gurdjieff—he was being singularlyshort-sighted.) Yet Gurdjieff was obviously brooding. On what? Probably on thefeeling that his ‘method’ was still unsatisfactory, and that something new wasneeded—something more practical. People can comfortably absorb new ideas and goback to sleep. He had to devise new methods of keeping them awake.Ouspensky returned to St Petersburg. Gurdjieff told him that he proposed to goto Kislovodsk to set up a new work group, and advised Ouspensky—and anyone elsewho was interested—to join him there. In fact, Gurdjieff went to Essentuki, inthe Caucasus. He rented a villa, and a house on the edge of the village; there,for six weeks, his pupils worked with a new kind of intensity. To begin with,Gurdjieff introduced various exercises and techniques. Some of the exercisesinvolved muscular exertion or relaxation, and would be familiar to any yogastudent of today. Others were more complex. It was here that Gurdjieffintroduced one of his most startling and spectacular exercises: the ‘stop’exercise. When he called ‘stop’, everyone had to stop instantaneously whateverthey were doing, even if they were halfway through a step, or swallowing amouthful of food. It was, he said, to try to make people aware of their way ofdoing things, of their exact posture and muscular response. In later years atthe Prieuré, he might walk into the dormitory in the middle of the night andsnap his fingers, and everyone had to be out of bed and in some complicatedposture within a matter of seconds. He was trying to cultivate total alertness.Gurdjieff explained that he was introducing them to the principle ofsuper-effort. If a man walks twenty-five miles in bad weather, and gets homecold and hungry—and then decides to walk another two miles before going indoors,that is super-effort.Here, I feel, Gurdjieff was failing to explain something important. It is notthe super-effort itself that is important, but the energy we summon to meet it.The whole point of Gurdjieff’s ‘system’—and this is never sufficientlyemphasized either in his own books or in those about him—is its basic assumptionthat man possesses far more energy than he realizes—a vast lake of ‘vitalreserves’. What cuts us off from these reserves is a feeling of laziness, orrather, of reluctance. We contemplate some effort, and think: ‘What a bore.’ Andthis feeling of boredom instantly lowers our vitality. If I performed asuper-effort—like walking the additional two miles—with a groan of self-pity, itwould be completely useless. Yet if some sudden crisis—or some sudden piece ofgood news (i.e. someone I love is waiting for me two miles away)—made me decideto walk the two miles, I would do it with a springy step, prepared, ifnecessary, to go ten times as far. This, then, is the real aim of the exercise:to summon that state of optimism, of inner purpose, that makes the super-efforteasy. As the story of Fritz Peters demonstrates (see Chapter 1), Gurdjieff hadmastered the trick of drawing on these vital reserves, overruling his‘reluctance’.But the practical significance of Gurdjieff’s doctrine of super-effort was thathe felt it provided a new basis for the ‘work’. In St Petersburg or Moscow, the‘work’ had been purely internal, so to speak. Now Gurdjieff was quitedeliberately looking for difficulties to which he could subject his followers,with the deliberate aim of making them ‘summon’ the necessary energy andattention. For example, when his pupil Thomas de Hartmann—an ex-armyofficer—arrived with his wife, Gurdjieff called to a follower called Zaharoff tomake tea in a samovar. This involved a difficult ritual of lighting tiny piecesof wood and coal under the samovar; they burned only with difficulty, and ifZaharoff turned away for a moment, they went out, and he had to start all overagain. For the remainder of his life, Gurdjieff apparently took immense pleasurein causing trouble and confusion—at one period, Fritz Peters broke with him in arage. The aim was to force his pupils to make ‘super-efforts’. Gurdjieff tookHartmann and his wife into the village to buy cake, and on the way back,accelerated his pace until they were practically running; again, it was aneffort to accustom his pupils to super-effort.Thomas de Hartmann’s book, Our Life with Mr Gurdjieff, is perhaps one of themost fascinating and revealing of all accounts of Gurdjieff as a person. He goeson to recount another of Gurdjieff’s deliberate ‘tricks’. At Essentuki, heannounced he intended to go to Persia—creating immediate alarm and confusionamong his followers. Hartmann, for one, was still an officer, and could notbecome a deserter without much agony of conscience. But on the day announced forhis departure, Gurdjieff declared he was only going to go to Tuapse, close tothe Black Sea, and said that anyone who wanted to come was welcome. TheHartmanns and several others decided to go. But at Tuapse, they found Gurdjiefflying in bed, apparently in a state of indecision. There was a ‘heavy atmospherewhich overwhelms one when he does not know what to do.’ And Hartmann addspenetratingly: ‘Mr Gurdjieff certainly knew how to create such an atmosphere.’In other words, Gurdjieff realized that his followers were now becomingdependent on his own strong sense of purpose; and wanted to try and shake themout of this habit before it had time to consolidate.What followed is again typical. Gurdjieff bought a cart and announced that theywould now leave. Gurdjieff drove off with the cart and luggage, and told theHartmanns to walk over the mountains and meet him some miles away. The walk waslong, hard and hot, and they finally discovered an inn where they could wait.Finally, after dark, Gurdjieff arrived. But instead of letting them go to bed,he proposed to continue the journey by moonlight. They plodded on—Madame deHartmann in high-heeled shoes—until two in the morning, when it began to rain;Gurdjieff told them to make a fire, then said they would sleep—all exceptHartmann, who was ordered to sit up on guard duty.The next day, Hartmann was dizzy with fatigue, and Gurdjieff told him to climbon to the luggage on the cart. But Hartmann discovered that if he closed hiseyes, he fell off the cart; so he had to fight against sleep. This, of course,is precisely what Gurdjieff intended. He believed that, through intense efforts,a certain form of energy is created—the energy man needs forself-transformation. Without that energy, he can think aboutself-transformation, even long for it, but can never achieve it.And so the journey went on. At least Hartmann realized the purpose behind it.‘By speaking of going to Persia and by creating all kinds of emotional andphysical difficulties, he was creating in strange surroundings a ladder ofobstacles over which we had to pass to reach a certain little do inourselves—the do in the scale of our general development.’In a place called Outch-Dary, Hartmann became seriously ill, after eating plumsfrom a tree (against Gurdjieff’s advice), and came close to death. In hisdelirium, he even tried to kill his wife. When Gurdjieff came in, Hartmannhurled himself at him in a frenzy. But when Gurdjieff placed his hand on hisforehead he felt a deep sense of peace, and relaxed. Gurdjieff still possessedhis ‘magical’ powers. Eventually, Hartmann recovered, and they returned toEssentuki. The journey had apparently been designed to place the Hartmanns underunusual stress.The same applied to an amusing incident involving a restaurant. Hartmann feltthat he would like to go to a social club and Gurdjieff pretended to think thathe and a doctor friend were invited for supper. Inflation was a serious problemand Hartmann had no regular income; nevertheless he took them to the restaurant.Gurdjieff proceeded to order the most expensive meal available, and Hartmann hadto tip the waiter to go to his wife and collect another 500 roubles. But thenext day, Gurdjieff returned the money to Hartmann, explaining that it had beendone for his own good. Hartmann was still not behaving like an adult—as hismisery and embarrassment about the meal demonstrated. It was the juvenile partof him that was being made to squirm.The situation in Russia was now serious. The Bolshevik revolution had takenplace; the provisional Kerensky government had been overthrown; Russia was tornby civil war. Students like Hartmann—and other ex-officers—were in danger. Butfor the moment, the Bolsheviks had only advanced as far as the northern slopesof the Caucasus; to the south, the Mensheviks—moderate socialists who opposedBolshevism—were still in power. Unfortunately, Gurdjieff and his students werein Bolshevik territory. Gurdjieff began by ensuring good relations with thelocal Bolsheviks; he told one of his students, a White Russian lawyer, to go andoffer his legal services to them. The lawyer managed to convince them that hewas an ardent revolutionary, by making a fiery speech about Proudhon andFourier, and was instantly accepted.Gurdjieff also told the lawyer to write to the Essentuki Soviet, making a formalrequest to organize a scientific expedition to Mount Indue in the Caucasus; theywould, he explained, search for standing stones—dolmens—and also for gold.Gurdjieff cunningly arranged for an article to appear in a newspaper inPiatigorsk—headquarters of the higher Soviet for the region—describing theexpedition and the importance of its aims. Permission was given. Gurdjieff evenpersuaded the Bolsheviks to supply quantities of pure alcohol for ‘washing thegold’; it was diluted for their own consumption. (Alcohol of any kind was bythen unobtainable.) The lawyer, who was by now in charge of the passport office,issued them all with Soviet passports.Hartmann was puzzled to see Gurdjieff beating the horses on the belly and makingthem rear up in anger and alarm. He understood why when soldiers later came torequisition the horses, then brought them back two hours later, declaring thatthey were dangerous. Finally the Bolsheviks provided the ‘expedition’ with atrain to take them to Maikop, on the edge of Bolshevik territory. Two weeksafter they had left Essentuki, a reign of terror began, and all ex-officers wereshot.Maikop fell into the hands of White Russian forces; it became necessary toobtain more passports, and the White Russians were difficult. But Gurdjieff’sluck held; an admiral who was an old friend of one of the group appeared, andarranged everything. The day after Gurdjieff and his party left Maikop, it wasretaken by the Bolsheviks. But by then they were on their way south. The journeyto Tiflis was difficult and dangerous; at one point, Hartmann and his party wereheld up and robbed by brigands. (Gurdjieff—with typical luck—had gone ahead atthis point and experienced no difficulties.) Fortunately, Hartmann’s wifepersuaded them out of taking some of their essential supplies. They were luckyto escape unscathed; other travellers had been killed on the same road.Gurdjieff’s announced intention of seeking for standing stones was not purefiction. When, in a mountain village, he heard that there were dolmens in thearea, he asked to be taken to one. The dolmen in question proved to be a sort ofgiant stone coffer with a lid. Asked about the nature of such stones, Gurdjieffreplied that they were ‘road signs’ showing the way to places of initiation—aview that reveals that he possessed some esoteric knowledge about the stones andtheir purpose. This is confirmed by what happened next. Gurdjieff asked theirguides if there were any more dolmens in the area; they said no. He then madecertain measurements and calculations, and led them through thick woods, whichhad to be cleared with hand axes. He led the party to two more dolmens, bothheavily overgrown and unknown to local people. Their guides were astonished. Inhis own account of the journey, Gurdjieff has the cryptic remark that variousexperts among his pupils—in engineering, astronomy, archeology—helped him to‘resolve the problem of the dolmens’. It is a pity that no record seems to existof his ‘solution’.Finally, they arrived in Tiflis, the capital of Georgia, still in Menshevikhands. Gurdjieff not only had his followers to support, but also twenty-eightrelatives, who had left Alexandropol in the face of the advancing Turks.(Gurdjieff’s father had been killed.) Gurdjieff was himself still suffering froman illness he had contracted during the journey; but with typical determination,he set out to make money. Some of his students were sent to the surrounding areato buy up old carpets at rag-and-bone prices; others washed and repaired them;then the carpets were sold. In a few weeks, the business was flourishing andthey had more than enough money for all their needs. It was another example ofGurdjieff’s basic assertion: that those who are good at ‘the work’ would also begood at the practical business of staying alive.In Tiflis, Gurdjieff once again set up his institute, with a certain amount ofhelp from the government. He was slowly refining and developing his ‘method’.Before leaving Essentuki, he had introduced the ‘movements’ or sacred dances asa basic discipline of the ‘moving centre’—the aim was to endow the body with itsown form of ‘consciousness’. Now he produced a prospectus in which he spoke of‘Exercises for the development of will, memory, attention, hearing, thinking,emotion, instinct.’ But the situation was precarious. The Georgian governmentwas propped up by a British military presence; and when the British decided towithdraw, it was only a matter of time before the Bolsheviks took over.The head of British military intelligence in Constantinople was a young Britishofficer named John Bennett. Like Gurdjieff, he was fascinated by the dervishesand their ceremonies. He had seen an old dervish lying on his back, with a razorsharp sword across his body, and a man standing on the sword; yet the olddervish’s body was not even marked. Bennet had become convinced that the answerto the mystery of our human limitations lies in the concept of the fifthdimension.Bennett had already met Ouspensky in Constantinople. Ouspensky had, by thistime, decided to separate from Gurdjieff. The reason he gives—in In Search ofthe Miraculous—is that he felt Gurdjieff’s work was becoming increasinglyoriented towards religion. The real reason, almost certainly, is that Ouspenskywas too dominant and original a mind to remain anyone’s ‘disciple’, and that hefound Gurdjieff’s enigmatic personality too devious and oriental for hiswesternized comprehension. In Constantinople they pursued their separate ways.Ouspensky’s first book Tertium Organum had recently been translated intoEnglish, and become something of a best seller—it led to Ouspensky being invitedto London by Lady Rothermere. Bennett was not impressed by Ouspensky’s ideas.And when he heard of Gurdjieff’s presence in Constantinople, his first reactionwas suspicion; he had received a despatch warning him that Gurdjieff was aBolshevik agent.His first meeting with Gurdjieff dispelled all doubts. This man ‘with thestrangest eyes I had ever seen’ obviously possessed a vast and precise knowledgeof subjects that Bennett only knew as a beginner. Bennett was invited to watchGurdjieff’s students perform their sacred ‘movements’, and was deeply impressed.It was a fascination that was to last a lifetime.For a year—until September 1921—Gurdjieff ran his institute from Constantinople.He had also—oddly enough—set up as a psychiatrist, and it was in this capacitythat he cured a young Greek of drug addiction and alcoholism. In return, he hadbeen given a half share in a ship, which had been requisitioned by the Britishnavy. With Bennett’s help, Gurdjieff was able to get the ship released and sold;his half-share provided enough money to realize an ambition he had felt eversince landing in Constantinople: to move his institute to Europe."},{"pageContent":"5—THE AWAKENING OF COURAGE> You think you know who you are and what you are; but you do not know either> what slaves you now are, or how free you might become.

One indignant listener, the ‘occultist’ A. E. Waite, stood upand said ‘Mr Ouspensky, there is no love in your system’, and walked out of theroom. But he was the exception. The rest of Ouspensky’s audiences—which includedmany professional doctors, psychiatrists and writers—found his doctrinesstartling, original and fascinating.As a Russian exile, Ouspensky was lucky to get a foothold in London. Gurdjieffalso attempted to set up his Institute in Hampstead, but was unable to obtainthe necessary visas. It made no difference; he had already decided that Pariswould be more suitable. (An earlier plan to establish himself in Germany wasdropped when he realized that the political situation there was as volatile asin Russia or Turkey.)Before leaving London, Gurdjieff gave a number of remarkable lectures. Bennettwas present at some of these and took notes, which he quotes in Gurdjieff,Making a New World. Again, they reveal the remarkable scientific precision ofGurdjieff’s insights. Gurdjieff was speaking of one of his most fundamentalconcepts: the difference between ‘personality’ and ‘essence’. When a baby isborn, it has only ‘essence’, its essential response to the world. At the age ofsix or seven the child begins to develop ‘personality’—that is, to become awareof itself as a person among other people—in response to other people. And whenthis happens, says Gurdjieff, ‘essence’ often ceases to grow altogether;personality takes over. Some people who appear to have a powerful and vitalpersonality are really empty inside; their essence ceased to develop as a child.In In Search of the Miraculous, Ouspensky describes an extraordinary experimentperformed by Gurdjieff to show his pupils the difference between essence andpersonality. Two people had been chosen for the purpose of the experiment; one aprominent middle-aged man with an important position, the other a ratherscatterbrained young man whose conversation tended to be wordy and confusing. Insome way, either by hypnosis or a drug (Ouspensky declined to be specific), bothwere plunged into a semi-trance like state in which ‘personality’ vanished.2 Theolder man became completely passive. Asked about the war—about which he had beenexpressing the most heated opinions a moment before—he said that it did notinterest him. The young man, on the other hand, talked seriously and simply,making excellent sense. Gurdjieff explained that the young man had a reasonablydeveloped ‘essence’ which had become overlaid with awkwardness, a tendency tooverreact to other people, so he appeared a nervous fool. The older man hadlittle ‘essence’ left; he had developed a bombastic and opinionated personality,but there was nothing underneath.At the end of the London lectures, Gurdjieff developed this concept of essenceand personality: ‘What you call “will” in yourself is only from personality. Ithas no connection with real will. Something touches personality, and it says “Iwant” or “I do not want” ... and thinks it is will. It is nothing. It ispassive. Will can be only in essence.’Essence, Gurdjieff explained, has no critical mind:> It is trustful, but because it does not know, it is apprehensive. You cannot> influence essence by logical argument, or convince it. Until essence begins to> experience for itself, it remains as it always was. Sometimes situations arise> where personality cannot react, and essence has to react. Then it is seen how> much there is in [a person’s] essence. Perhaps it is only a child and does not> know how to behave. It is no use telling it to behave differently, because it> will not understand your language.Perhaps the most significant statement in this lecture on essence andpersonality is the following: ‘Essence and personality are even in differentparts of the brain.’ At the time he made this statement, it could have meantvery little even to the doctors and psychologists in his audience—unless theyhappen to recall a tag of the neurologist Hughlings Jackson, who remarked:‘Expression on the left, recognition on the right.’ What he meant was that thehuman brain seems to be divided into two parts, and the left cerebral hemisphereis concerned with language and logic, while the right is concerned withrecognition (i.e. of faces) and intuition. It was not until well after the deathof Gurdjieff that an American scientist, R.W. Sperry, tried the experiment ofcutting the isthmus of nerve fibre joining the two halves of the brain, and madethe astonishing discovery that we literally have two different persons insideour heads. If a ‘divided brain’ patient is shown something with his left eyeonly (which is connected, for some odd reason, to the right side of the brain),and asked what he has been shown, he cannot reply. But if he is asked to writewhat he has seen with his left hand, he can write its name without any trouble.If he is shown an orange with his left eye and an apple with his right, and heis asked what he has just seen, he replies: ‘An apple’. Asked to write down whathe has seen with the left hand, he writes: ‘An orange’. Asked what he has justwritten, he replies: ‘An apple’. If he is shown an indecent picture with theleft eye only, he will blush. Asked why he is blushing, he replies truthfully:‘I don’t know.’That is to say, the ‘I’ inhabits the left side of the brain, the side connectedwith language and logic. A few centimetres away there is another ‘I’, an ‘I’without a voice, of which the left appears to be totally unaware.Psychologists are still completely ignorant of the nature of hypnosis. How is itthat a person can be placed in a trance, and then persuaded to do things that hecould not do in his conscious state: stop smoking, make warts disappear, evenlie rigid between two chairs while a heavy man stands on his stomach? In trance,the conscious ego falls asleep, while some part of one’s inner being remainswide awake. (A hypnotized person’s brain rhythms are the same as when he is wideawake.) This suggests that hypnosis causes the left-brain to fall asleep, whilethe right remains awake. And when the critical, conscious ego is asleep, ournatural powers can express themselves without constrictions. (We all know howtoo much self-consciousness makes us clumsy and inefficient.)Anyone can learn a great deal about these two ‘selves’ by ordinaryself-observation. For example, it is clear that the left-brain is the source ofall ordinary acts of will: ‘I’ decide to do something. But the right-brain seemsto be responsible for our energy supplies. When ‘I’ become tired and jaded, Ican quickly renew myself if I can forget the ego, become deeply absorbed insomething that ‘takes me out of myself’. This is clearly a trick that Gurdjieffunderstood, and which explains how he was able to renew his energies so quicklyafter ‘recharging’ the exhausted Fritz Peters.In short, self-observation seems to confirm that we consist of two different‘selves’ and that these correspond to Gurdjieff’s essence and personality. Whatis most amazing is that Gurdjieff knew they could be located in different partsof the brain, although it seems likely that he knew nothing of brain physiology.Again, we are forced to conclude that he may have been telling the truth when heclaimed that his system was based upon some ancient scientific knowledge thathad been long forgotten by most of the human race.In France, Gurdjieff soon located a house that seemed to be ideal for thesetting up of his institute: the Chateau du Prieuré, near Fontainebleau,formerly the home of Madame de Maintenon, second wife of Louis the Fourteenth.It had large and rambling grounds—providing plenty of opportunity for ‘work’.Gurdjieff rented it for a year, with an option to buy. But it left himpenniless. Again, he had to find ways to make large sums of money. He startedtwo Paris restaurants, and entered the oil business; he also set up once againas a psychiatrist, offering to cure alcoholism and drug addiction. His successin this field was apparently remarkable, although at present we possess nopublished account of his methods. All this involved enormous overwork, and thestretching of his vital energies to their limits. He tells us, driving back tothe Prieuré one night in a state of exhaustion, he fell asleep, but somehowstopped the car at the side of the road; he was awakened next morning by a farmwagon trying to get past. As a result, he caught a severe chill whose effectswere long-lasting.One student, Gladys Alexander, wrote:> Life [at the Prieuré] was spurred to a highly accelerated pace. It ranged from> the heavy toil of the old-fashioned kitchen and scullery, from the work of the> house and the laundry, the flower and kitchen gardens, to the care of horses,> donkey cart, sheep and goats, cows and calves, hens, pigs and dogs. It was> lived in a seething atmosphere of speed and tension, of zeal and high hopes.It was Gurdjieff’s friend Pogossian who had told him the basic secret aboutwork. Pogossian never relaxed; he always moved his arms rhythmically, markedtime with his feet; he explained that his aim was to accustom his nature to lovework, to overcome its natural laziness. Now Gurdjieff applied the lesson to hispupils.But this was not the only purpose of the physical hard work at the Prieuré. Italso sprang from Gurdjieff’s recognition that ‘personality’ is one of the majorobstacles to self-actualization. Personality is a fool; it over-reacts, itdistrusts itself, it is inclined to despair. We can see this in the case of theyoung man whose ‘essence’ was far more sensible and controlled than hispersonality, which behaved like a buffoon. The problem becomes twice asdifficult if there is a lack of serious aim and objective. Hard work and seriousaims soon teach the personality to shut up and keep quiet. Many of Gurdjieff’spupils were rich people who had never done a hard day’s work in their lives. Sohard work was an essential first step in readjusting their inner balance.Physical labour has another immense advantage. When the body is tired, itrelaxes; the ‘personality’ takes the hint, and also makes itself inconspicuous.This explains, for example, why it is far easier to ‘sink into’ music or poetrywhen you are physically tired. The personality ceases to form an obstacle, abarrier. It ceases to chatter and interrupt. So the contact between the essenceof the listener and the essence of the music—or poetry—is more immediate anddirect. And the contact between Gurdjieff’s essence and that of his pupils wouldalso become more direct.Predictably, there was a great deal of misunderstanding and criticism. RomLandau says in God Is My Adventure (published in 1935), ‘Some of the pupilswould at times complain that they could no longer support Gurdjieff’s violenttemper, his apparent greed for money, or the extravagance of his private life.’The last is probably intended as a covert reference to Gurdjieff’s reputationfor seducing his female students. (In Providence, Rhode Island, in 1960, a manwas pointed out to me as one of Gurdjieff’s illegitimate children. The professorwho told me this also assured me that Gurdjieff had left many children aroundAmerica.)3 A consumptive Russian girl, Irene Reweliotty, who was introduced tothe ‘work’ by her lover Luc Dietrich, was invited to dinner by Gurdjieff, whoasked her (in Russian) to return after the other guests had left. Convinced thathe had seduction in mind, she telephoned him to say that her mother wasexpecting her home. ‘Gurdjieff then insulted her in a way that left her no doubtof his intentions,’ says Louis Pauwels in his book on Gurdjieff. When she toldanother disciple about this, he slapped her face. A few days later, she died ofa heart attack.But the accusation most frequently brought against Gurdjieff was that he reducedhis pupils to automata through overwork. One woman disciple vomited blood andthe doctor diagnosed a burst ulcer; Gurdjieff denied that it was blood andoffered a different diagnosis. But an operation was to reveal that the doctorhad been correct. The impression that Gurdjieff treated his students like abrutal drill sergeant was strengthened by stories that were circulated after thedeath of Katherine Mansfield. The New Zealand writer was already dying oftuberculosis when she decided to ask Gurdjieff if she could come to the Prieuréin October 1922. For the first six weeks she was allowed to live as an onlooker,then expected to join in with the work, preparing meals in the kitchen.Gurdjieff decided that she needed the breath of cows to improve her health, andactually installed a couch above the cows in the barn, where she could sit andinhale. It was all to no avail, and in January, ten weeks after her arrival, shedied of a haemorrhage. Her letters to her husband, Middleton Murry, make itclear that there was no attempt to overwork her. But her death gave Gurdjieff’sInstitute a sinister reputation.All the same, it is clear that the hard work could be dangerous. Bennett notonly survived his attack of dysentery and overwork, but gained from them. Thosewith weaker spirits or less persistence may well have collapsed from exhaustion.Louis Pauwels states that ‘after two years of “work” ... I found myself inhospital, as weak as a kitten, one eye nearly gone, on the verge of suicide andcalling desperately for help at 3 o’clock in the morning.’ And he speaks of twoAmerican girls who had spent two years in a group directed by Madame de S.(presumably Jeanne de Salzmann): ‘They were at their last gasp, ready to takethe plunge into death, in fact, already bending over it—fascinated.’ He advisedthem to break away from the ‘teaching’ and retire to a seaside resort.All of which brings us to the heart of the Gurdjieff problem. As a young man—aswe have seen—Gurdjieff was driven half frantic by the sense of his inability tocontrol his ‘forgetfulness’. For this is the central human problem: ordinaryforgetfulness, like walking into a room to get something, and forgetting whatyou went in for. When we get something we want badly, or experience someenormous relief from misery or crisis, we feel that we shall never forget thishappiness; but twenty-four hours later, nothing but a dim carbon copy remains,and we are again wholly absorbed in trivialities. If we could take a course innot ‘forgetting’, our lives would obviously be completely transformed. And,after all, any intelligent person can train himself to be less absent-minded. Itseems preposterous that nothing except a little absent-mindedness stands betweenus and a life that is ten times as satisfying as the present one. Anybody whorealizes this experiences Gurdjieff’s tremendous sense of frustration, and iswilling to make the most exhausting efforts to ‘break through’.And therein lies the problem. For exhaustion makes things ten times as bad. Whenwe are healthy and wide awake we are always experiencing the sudden flash ofsheer ‘absurd delight’ that reawakens our sense of meaning and purpose. Butexhaustion makes everything seem dead, so that no effort seems worth making. Theworld becomes ‘stale, flat and unprofitable’. And if we are taken in by thisapparent meaninglessness, this is a highly dangerous state. It becomes a viciouscircle of depression and fatigue. Without a sense of purpose, a human being islike a sailor without a compass.For men like Ouspensky and Bennett, the danger did not exist. Long before theymet Gurdjieff, they had spent years searching for some kind of knowledge; so noamount of fatigue was likely to make them lose heart—that is, to be taken in bythe sense of meaninglessness. A person like Katherine Mansfield was a differentproposition. Even John Carswell’s sympathetic book about her4 makes it clearthat she was an emotional dilettante, driven by a mixture of egoism and boredom.If she had recovered her health at the Prieuré, she might well have gone off andwritten a satirical short story about it all, portraying Gurdjieff as acharlatan. Gurdjieff was subjected to a great deal of criticism for the mannerin which he got rid of unsatisfactory pupils—like Zaharoff, whom he sent back toPetrograd from Essentuki—but it seems clear that he failed to exercise enough ofthis kind of selectivity.What emerges clearly from Gurdjieff’s own account of the founding ofFontainebleau Institute is that he was in a state of physical exhaustion formuch of the time, and was permanently worried about money. If he drove hispupils to the limits of endurance, he also drove himself. And, as Bennettacknowledges, it worked.> In spite of the obstacles, Gurdjieff during the period from November 1922 to> December 1923 had accomplished something that had never been seen in Europe> before. He created conditions for work that enabled scores of people to verify> for themselves the potential for transformation that is latent in every human> being. The basic method was simple: it consisted of offering pupils the> opportunity and the means of stretching to the limit the capacity of their> physical body for work, for attention, for the acquisition of skills, and for> the production of psychic energy ... No description of the external life at> the Prieuré can give any adequate idea of what was happening inside people.> They could see for themselves that miracles were possible and were occurring> before their eyes. The atmosphere was happy and vital, not gloomy and> monastic.But to emphasize the work itself would be to miss the whole point. In a basicsense, the work was totally unimportant. Two stories illustrate this. Bennettsays that one day Gurdjieff announced that ordinary physical labour was notenough: they all had to learn various skills: shoe-making, engineering, basketweaving, and so on. He asked for volunteers, and everybody raised his hand. Butthe actual instruction failed to materialize. However, Bennett makes theinteresting remark that the expectation of all this additional work galvanizedeverybody and made them more energetic.Fritz Peters was told to mow the lawns once every four days. When he hadachieved this, Gurdjieff—instead of praising him—told him that he now had to doit all on one day. Seeing Peters’s disappointment and frustration, he took himto a nearby field, full of high grass, and told him that when he had learned tomow the lawns in one day, he would be transferred to this field, which he wouldhave to learn to scythe in one day. (Peters was a rather small eleven-year-oldat the time.) Understandably, Peters’s heart sank at the prospect. Yet hepressed on and managed to mow all the lawns in one day, finding that hisself-pity and resentment vanished as he worked. When, finally, he askedGurdjieff when he had to scythe the field, Gurdjieff made the curious reply:‘Not necessary. You have already done the work.’ That is to say, the prospect ofthe far harder job of scything the field had made Peters begin to treat hislawnmowing problem as a minor task. This is what Gurdjieff was interestedin—something that might be called ‘the awakening of courage’.In early 1924, Gurdjieff’s precarious financial position made him decide to tryto refill his coffers in America. A demonstration of his dances at the Théâtredes Champs-Elysées in December 1923 was a considerable success, and it may havebeen this that gave Gurdjieff the idea of earning money across the Atlantic.Ouspensky was able to help by putting him in contact with Claude Bragdon, whohad translated Tertium Organum. A. R. Orage, who had given up the editorship ofthe New Age to work with Gurdjieff, was sent ahead to prepare the ground. (Orageended by staying on in New York.) Gurdjieff and his troupe arrived in January1924—forty of them—and gave a demonstration at Leslie’s Ballroom on the 23rd.The pupils performed their ‘movements’, to the accompaniment of eastern musicand a beating drum, and then gave an exhibition of ‘magnetism, clairvoyance andmind-reading’. Members of the audience were asked to show some personal objectto a pupil in the audience. Pupils on stage then gave accurate descriptions ofwhat had been shown. Names of operas were suggested to pupils in the audience,who ‘transferred’ the information to Thomas de Hartmann on stage, who thenplayed excerpts from the opera. In the same way, pupils in the audience‘transmitted’ the names of living animals to an artist on stage, who then drewthem on large sheets of white paper. It was a remarkable exhibition ofmind-reading, and at least one member of the audience, A. S. Nott (who laterwrote Teachings of Gurdjieff: The Journal of a Pupil), was baffled and deeplyimpressed. Another member, William Seabrook, was inclined to dismiss them asmere conjuring tricks. (Orage told the audience that the performance wouldinvolve ‘tricks, half-tricks and true supernatural phenomena’, and left theaudience to guess which was which.) Seabrook wrote:> What excited and interested me was the amazing, brilliant, automaton-like,> inhuman, almost incredible docility and robot-like obedience of the disciples.> They were like a group of perfectly trained zombies, or like circus animals> ...> > The group consisted of young and youngish women, most of whom were handsome> and some of whom were beautiful; and of men who looked as if they had come,> and probably did in most cases, from the best British and Continental homes> and universities.

It had been almost too much.’5Llewellyn Powys also has a brief description of the Gurdjieff troupe in TheVerdict of Bridlegoose:> [Gurdjieff] had a high, bald head, with sharp, black eyes. His general> appearance made one think of a riding-master, though there was something about> his presence that affected one’s nerves in a strange way.

In the midst of the jazz age, New Yorkers were not deeply interestedin oriental dances. The ‘troupe’ was actually looking for other work when AdolfBolm, late of the Diaghilev ballet, invited them to Chicago. Their performancesthere were a success, as was a final performance at Carnegie Hall. But theAmerican visit had not brought Gurdjieff as much as he had hoped.Olga de Hartmann has a typical story of Gurdjieff at this period. He asked herto return to Paris alone, because he needed her husband to remain with him inNew York for a while. She flatly refused; Gurdjieff was displeased, but knew shewas immovable. She and her husband returned to Paris without Gurdjieff. When shehad purchased the boat tickets, she realized they had no money left, so shepawned one of her rings. It was one she particularly valued, and she left amessage for her brother—who was in New York—to redeem it. In fact, Gurdjiefffound out about it, and redeemed it himself, giving it back to her when hereturned to the Prieuré. He was not a man to bear grudges.Back at Fontainebleau, work continued as usual. On 5 July 1924, Gurdjieff spentthe day in Paris. The steering wheel of his car needed attention, and he left itat a garage. He told Olga de Hartmann to do some secretarial work at his Parisflat, then return to the Prieuré by train. She was annoyed because it was a hotday, and she usually drove back with Gurdjieff in the car. In Gurdjieff s flatshe fell asleep and was suddenly awakened by his voice calling to her. But hewas nowhere to be seen.In fact, Gurdjieff had crashed into a tree—probably due to the defectivesteering column—and was lying badly injured and unconscious at the time sheheard his voice.1 Witness, J.G. Bennett, p 87.2 In Venture With Ideas, Kenneth Walker says that Ouspensky told him Gurdjieffused a drug on this occasion.3 ‘[Gurdjieff] spoke of women in terms that would have better suited a fanaticalMuslim polygamist than a Christian, boasting that he had many children bydifferent women, and that women were for him only the means to an end.’—Witness,J.G. Bennett, p 258.4 Life and Letters—Studies of A. R. Orage, Beatrice Hastings, KatherineMansfield, J. M. Murry and S. S. Kotehansky. London 1978. Carswell’s account ofGurdjieff is unsympathetic and ill-informed, but should be read as aninteresting example of the kind of misunderstanding Gurdjieff continues toarouse.5 William Seabrook: Witchcraft, Its Power in the World Today (1942), Part 2,Chapter 3.6 The Verdict of Bridlegoose, Chapter 17."},{"pageContent":"6—NEW DIRECTIONSGurdjieff’s accident—which brought him close to death—was the beginning of a newepoch in his life. He decided that his ideas had to be transmitted to posterity.One morning, in the Café de la Paix, he started dictating to Olga de Hartmann:‘It was in the year 223 after the creation of the World ... Through the Universeflew the ship Karnak of the ‘trans-space’ communication’. It was the beginningof his enormous book Beelzebub’s Tales to His Grandson.This was a period of deep gloom for everybody. Gurdjieff’s accident left thedisciples shattered; they felt he should be invulnerable. Gurdjieff himself wasprofoundly shaken; he felt that the accident had caused his consciousness torevert to an earlier stage in its development. In his state of broken physicalhealth, it was obvious that the institute could not continue in the same way asbefore. He announced to his assembled students that he intended to close itdown. Most of the Russians packed up and left the following day. In fact, theinstitute continued to function. But Gurdjieff no longer looked upon it as hislife’s work.There were further problems. His mother—who, together with his sister andbrother, was living at the Prieuré—was suffering from a liver complaint; soonafter his accident, she died. Gurdjieff had been deeply attached to her, and itwas a considerable blow. Here again, Bennett has a story that reveals much aboutGurdjieff. Many years later, in 1948, Bennett went to see Gurdjieff in Paris.Bennett had lost his own mother, and Gurdjieff asked him about her. ThenGurdjieff made the curious comment: ‘She is in need of help because she cannotfind her way by herself. My own mother is already free and I can help her.Through her your mother can be helped, but you have to bring them into contact.’He instructed Bennett to take two chairs, and to stand in front of them,envisaging his own mother in one and Gurdjieff’s mother in the other. Bennetttried hard for weeks, and found the exercise immensely difficult. On oneoccasion he sobbed for half an hour. Nothing seemed to be happening, until oneday he became aware of presences in the room. These finally took the shape ofhis own mother and Gurdjieff’s. Eventually, he felt that the two had establishedcontact, and experienced an immense wave of relief and gratitude. Gurdjieff hadtold him: ‘You cannot help her yourself: but through my mother I can help you.’It seems clear that Gurdjieff believed that he was somehow in contact with hismother after death.The motor accident involved another tragedy. For some time Gurdjieff’s wife hadbeen suffering from cancer, and he had been making immense efforts to cure herby a technique from Central Asia that made use of astral power. His motoraccident made this impossible; his wife died soon after. Yet a story told byOlga de Hartmann again demonstrates his curious powers. Towards the end, hiswife was in such pain that she could not eat, or even drink. Gurdjieff asked forhalf a glass of water, and held it in his hands for five minutes; then he askedOlga de Hartmann to give it to her. His wife succeeded in drinking the waterwithout pain, and was suddenly able to take liquid food again.1Slowly, Gurdjieff recovered from the effects of his accident. He was inclined tobelieve that some ‘hostile power’ had caused it, and was trying actively tointerfere with his work. But he now directed all his energies to writing. Muchof his income now came from America, where Orage had started his own Gurdjieffgroup. Gurdjieff was not entirely happy about Orage as a teacher of his ideas,but he was grateful for the money.Gurdjieff’s writing—particularly Beelzebub—will always be a matter ofcontention. The style is so impossibly involved that it makes an immediateimpression of pretentious nonsense. It is also full of outlandish words:kundabuffer, gaidoropoolo, geneotriamazikamnian, harhrinhrarh, blastegoklornian,and dozens of others. (The last means simply the circumference of the atmosphereof our planet, which leads one to wonder why Gurdjieff needed to invent this newword.) The explanation offered by many of his followers is that the style hasbeen made deliberately difficult in order to force the reader to work at it.This view is reinforced by the study of his early book Herald of Coming Good,where the difficulty of the style is due simply to the insertion of dozens ofsubordinate clauses. Here is an example:> This protracted and, for me, absolutely unnatural life, absolutely> irreconcilable, too, in every way with the traits that had entrenched> themselves in my individuality by the time of my maturity, was the direct> consequence of my decision, founded upon the results of my previous study of a> whole series of historic precedents with a view, first of all,—to preventing,> by to a certain degree unnatural outward manifestations of myself, the> formation, in relation to me, that already noted from ancient times> ‘something’, termed by the great Solomon, King of Juda, ‘Tzvarnoharno’, which,> as was set out by our ancestors, forms itself by a natural process in the> communal life of people as an outcome of a conjunction of the evil actions of> the so-called ‘common people’ and leads to the destruction of both him that> tries to achieve something for general human welfare and of all that he has> accomplished to this end.Here, Bennett’s explanation that ‘Tzvarnoharno’ is probably derived from thePahlavi word for majesty does nothing to make Gurdjieff’s meaning any clearer.Fortunately, a passage in his last book, Life Is Real Only Then, When ‘I Am’throws some light on it; Gurdjieff says there that he considers his seriousmotor accident a manifestation of that ‘something’ accumulating in the commonlife of people, which seems to imply that it is a kind of hostilitydirected—unconsciously—at those who have achieved too much success.In any case, it is clear that the obscurity of the passage is increased byGurdjieff’s habit of inserting a dozen parentheses into the sentence. This, Isuspect, is a habit of mind rather than a deliberate attempt to irritate thereader. Gurdjieff’s spoken lectures were always clear and to the point. But whenhe took up a pen, his mind flowed naturally into a more elaborate and floweryeastern mould.Orage was of the opinion that when it came to expressing his ideas on paper,Gurdjieff was simply incompetent. William Seabrook came to hold the sameopinion. He tells how, in January 1931, Gurdjieff asked him to invite a group ofcultured New Yorkers to Gurdjieff’s apartment to hear a reading from his newbook. Marvellous and elaborate eastern food had been prepared (Gurdjieff was acelebrated cook.) The audience included the writer Lincoln Steffens and thepsychologist J. B. Watson. After the reading had been going on for some time,Watson interrupted, saying that this was either an elaborate joke, or it waspiffle. In either event, it might be better to drop the reading and talk. Theauthor accepted this without offence, and was so amusing and witty during themeal that the guests began to press him to admit that his book was a joke.Gurdjieff, according to Seabrook, remained unoffended, but implied that it wassimply above their heads.Whatever else Beelzebub is, it is certainly not a joke. Gurdjieff himself makesthis clear. He writes that in 1927, after three years of hard work, he realizedthat he had not, after all, succeeded in conveying his ideas to his readers, andthat extensive rewriting would be necessary. His exhaustion and the difficultiesof authorship made him contemplate suicide. But the book was totally rewritten.There can be no doubt that, even after these immense labours, it is still not abook for those approaching Gurdjieff for the first time. (I know one highlyintelligent man who has remained unalterably convinced that Gurdjieff is acharlatan because he attempted to become acquainted with his ideas throughBeelzebub.)On the other hand Bennett, who was thoroughly acquainted with Gurdjieff’s mainideas, told me that he had read it a dozen times, and that each time he hadfound new meanings that he had never noticed before. On the whole, it isprobably safe to assume that it is the most important single product ofGurdjieff’s immensely productive life.The tremendous labours involved in writing Beelzebub brought Gurdjieff anotherimportant insight. He tells how he was sitting on the bench at the Prieuré wherehe used to sit with his wife and mother, and that it suddenly struck him thathis creativity had been increased by the suffering he had experienced as aresult of their deaths. In effect, this suffering had strengthened his‘essence’. He had also noted, when lying in bed after his accident, that friendswho came to visit him sucked away his energy, leaving him exhausted. They weresucking away what he called hanblezoin, or the energy of the astral body, whichis essential to creative work. The insight that came to Gurdjieff was thathanblezoin must be created by conscious effort and by ‘intentionalsuffering’—the kind of suffering that saints experience on their beds of nails.With this in mind, Gurdjieff began deliberately ridding himself of manydisciples—like the Hartmanns. He felt that not only were they building up toomuch dependence on him, but that they were making him too comfortable. A quarrelabout some English kippers was used as a pretext for sending the Hartmanns tolive in Paris in 1929. Various other disciples were also requested to leave. Yetall who left remained loyal to Gurdjieff, convinced that this was not merecaprice.Orage had to bear an unusually difficult rejection. Gurdjieff came to New Yorkwhile he was in England, and required Orage’s group to sign a document agreeingto break off relations with Orage. When Orage was shown this document, he tookthe blow calmly, and signed it himself.In trying to assess Gurdjieff’s motives for actions like this, it is as well tobear in mind a story told by Olga de Hartmann. Gurdjieff suggested that sheshould ask her parents to leave Leningrad and come to the Prieuré, sincepolitical conditions were becoming increasingly dangerous. Her sister andparents came, but were not happy at Fontainebleau ‘because’, as Mme de Hartmannsays, ‘of the ruthless manner in which Mr Gurdjieff very often spoke with all ofus.’ One morning, Gurdjieff and Olga’s father were sitting on a bench when shecame to ask some question. Gurdjieff answered her angrily, and her father lookedupset and miserable. Then Gurdjieff turned to her father and said: ‘You see,father, what you make me do. You never shouted at your daughter, so she has nothad this experience, and all sorts of impressions are necessary for people. Sonow I am obliged to do it in your place.’ Her father, apparently, understoodwhat he meant.‘And all sorts of impressions are necessary for people.’ This seems to have beenthe principle behind some of Gurdjieff’s most puzzling actions. Peters himselfcame to recognize this after a particularly traumatic experience. In 1934,Peters had to go to Chicago, and Gurdjieff announced that he would accompanyhim. The trip was a nightmare. Gurdjieff arrived late at the railway station,and made Peters go and make up a story to have the train delayed. Petersactually succeeded in doing this. It took three-quarters of an hour to getGurdjieff to his berth, complaining loudly all the way, although the conductorkept begging him to be silent for the sake of the sleeping passengers. Gurdjieffthen decided to eat, drink and smoke, until the conductor threatened to throwthem off at the next stop. When Peters lost his temper, Gurdjieff asked himsadly why he was treating him in this way.Once in his berth, Gurdjieff demanded water—to the fury of the other passengers.He settled down to sleep only at 4 a.m. The next morning, at breakfast,Gurdjieff made an endless fuss about wanting yogurt, then, after drivingeverybody to a frenzy, ate a normal American breakfast. During the remainder ofthe trip he kept his fellow passengers in a constant state of annoyance bysmoking, drinking heavily, and producing strong smelling cheeses.When they reached Chicago, Peters told him angrily that he was leaving, andGurdjieff set up such an outcry that Peters had to consent to going with him andthe group of adoring disciples. Peters finally shocked the disciples bydenouncing Gurdjieff in four letter words, and strode out. But when he sawGurdjieff again in New York a few years later, it struck him that the wholeincident had been designed to force him out of his attitude of blindhero-worship. It had undoubtedly worked.Peters has another story that illustrates Gurdjieff’s skill in ‘handling’people, as well as his sense of humour. Gurdjieff had invited a group of‘important’ people to dinner. Before they arrived, he asked Peters to teach himevery obscene word and phrase he knew. The guests arrived—many of themjournalists—and sat down to dinner. In a slightly patronizing manner, they beganasking Gurdjieff questions about his work. Gurdjieff then began to explain thatmost people are not really motivated by the desire for truth or order, but bytheir sexual drives. He spoke to a well-dressed, attractive woman, and told herthat the care she took of her appearance was based on a ‘desire to fuck’. Hebegan to speak of his own sexual prowess, then of the sexual habits of variousraces, always using the crudest words he could find. After the meal, the guestsbegan to flirt with one another, and many of them were soon lying around in astate of partial undress. The woman whom Gurdjieff had complimented began makingpasses at him, while another woman tried to corner Peters in the kitchen; whenhe rebuffed her, she accused him of being ‘that dirty old man’s little faggot’.Suddenly, in a stentorian voice, Gurdjieff called them to attention, and beganto mock them, telling them that they now knew what kind of people they reallywere. He ended by saying that he deserved to be paid for giving them thislesson, and would be glad to accept cheques. As a result, he collected severalthousand dollars.By 1935, Gurdjieff had also given up writing, abandoning a final book, Life isReal Only Then, When ‘I Am’, when it was less than half finished. Since he wasstill scarcely more than sixty, (or only fifty-eight, if the date of hispassport is accurate) it seems unlikely that he regarded his life-work asfinished. But the Institute had collapsed, and he seemed to have no plans forfurther writing. The Prieuré was sold in 1933, and when Peters met Gurdjieff inNew York in the mid-thirties he was again short of money, which he earned bytreating drug-addicts and alcoholics. (This period, fortunately, was brief.) SoGurdjieff continued to lecture and teach in America—dividing his time betweenthe groups in Chicago and New York—while Ouspensky carried on the work inLondon.Both were in the paradoxical position of wanting to spread the teaching, yetwanting to prevent it from spreading too fast or indiscriminately. Peterscomments of the Chicago group:> They seemed to me to have been attracted to his teaching for a variety of not> very good reasons—because of loneliness, or perhaps because they considered> themselves misfits or outcasts. Most of them had dabbled in the arts,> theosophy, the occult ... I began to sense a certain danger in his teaching> when it was carried on without his personal supervision.Ouspensky’s London pupils were made to behave like conspirators, and ordered notto discuss the teaching with any outsiders; when Bennett asked permission toquote Ouspensky, he was refused.The chief difference between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, as teachers, was thatGurdjieff always seems to have found human beings amusing and interesting, whileOuspensky struck his followers as a scientist, a man wholly preoccupied withspreading the idea of the ‘fight against sleep’, with little interest in peopleas individuals. Gurdjieff seems to have derived a great deal of quiet amusementfrom his disciples. Peters tells a story about a girl, a dancer, who achieved acertain amount of authority within one of his groups, but was aggressive anddifficult. One day, after she had openly challenged some statement he had madeduring a lecture, Gurdjieff sent her a message asking her to come to his roomalone at three in the morning, where he would show her some astonishing things.Peters relayed the message, and the girl was indignant; she said she recognizeda proposition when she heard it, and would never have anything more to do withGurdjieff. When Peters carried back this message, Gurdjieff chuckled withsatisfaction and said this is precisely what he had hoped. He added theinteresting remark that it was just as well that she had turned him down,because he would not have had time to deal with the ‘reverberations’ that wouldhave followed if she had accepted his invitation. The implication seems to bethat no ‘involvement’ can be without consequences. ‘Casual sex’ is acontradiction in terms. Again, one senses that Gurdjieff was aware of certainunderlying laws of human existence.Shortly before the Second World War, Gurdjieff returned to Paris. When theGermans invaded France, he seems to have ignored pleas to escape to ‘freeFrance’, but stayed on at his flat in the Rue des Colonels Rénards. One of thefirst of the American followers to see him after the war was Fritz Peters who—aswe have seen in the first chapter—came to him suffering from deep nervousdepression, which Gurdjieff cured instantaneously with some kind of infusion ofvital energy. He told Peters that he had managed to live comfortably during thewar by selling rugs; he also owned a company that made false eyelashes. He alsotold Peters that he had made deals with many people—Germans, policemen, blackmarketeers—and so had managed to keep himself supplied with necessities liketobacco and brandy. He was still surrounded by disciples, who also provided partof his income. But Peters also noticed a number of rather shabby old people whovisited the flat, and whom Gurdjieff treated with a kindliness and gentlenessthat was completely unlike his attitude to his students; he apparently regardedthese as his ‘pensioners’.Other American students began to drift back to Paris. Bennett came with hiswife, who was suffering from a mysterious illness. He found Gurdjieff lookingolder and sadder, although he held himself as erect as ever. Gurdjieff was nowcasually dressed in open necked shirt, untidy trousers and a red fez. Duringlunch—at which about forty people were wedged into the tiny dining room—henoticed that Mrs Bennett was in pain. Gurdjieff fetched two pills and told herto swallow them. Later he asked her: ‘Where is your pain now?’ She answered: ‘Itis gone.’ ‘I ask you where is it now?’ Her eyes filled with tears and sheanswered: ‘You have taken it.’ In fact, her health now suddenly improved.Kenneth Walker and his wife also came to the flat; Walker had been a student ofOuspensky’s for many years, having been introduced to him by Maurice Nicoll, oneof the original Prieuré group. Walker describes the flat as looking like acrowded junk shop. Gurdjieff entered while they were all listening to a readingfrom Beelzebub. Walker comments that he was shorter and stouter than heexpected; he also noted the piercing eyes. Again, an enormous number of peoplewere present at lunch, and everyone was made to drink toasts in Armagnac orvodka. Gurdjieff explained once that he always made his guests half drunkbecause this was the quickest way of making them drop the ‘personality’ andreveal what was inside them. It was after this encounter that Walker’s wifedescribed Gurdjieff as a magician.Several other Ouspensky disciples visited the flat. Walker remarks that ‘toomuch theorizing [had tended] to make the minds of his London followers toorigid, and our behaviour too calculated and grim. We were in danger of acquiringthe chapel-going faces of Plymouth Brethren.’ Gurdjieff’s boozy lunches anddinners (which always began well after midnight) were just what was needed tomake them relax and bring them closer together. This again illustrates the basicdifference between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Walker observes that Gurdjieff gavehim a completely new attitude towards the ‘work’. Ouspensky was adisciplinarian; when he set a task, Walker carried it out as scrupulously aspossible, but never tried to go further than that.> With Gurdjieff I began to develop a sense of personal responsibility and to> experience a new sense of freedom. At the same time it was a freedom which> must be very carefully used for the punishment for error was very great. It> was the punishment of seeing one’s teacher gravely inconvenienced by one’s> mistake, and it was difficult to be in close touch with Gurdjieff for long> without developing an affection for him.That autumn—1948—Gurdjieff went back to America once more. Ouspensky, convincedthat Europe was doomed, had carried on his work in New York during the waryears, but illness finally drove him back to London. He died in 1948, leavingthe manuscript of his most important book, Fragments of an Unknown Teaching,later published under the title In Search of the Miraculous. Gurdjieff took overthe Ouspensky group in New York, and his impact is described by Irmis B. Popoffin her book Gurdjieff. She speaks of the enormous impression of kindness andcompassion that he made.Gurdjieff’s stay in New York seems to have been as hectic as his days inParis—vast meals for dozens of people, dancing classes, lectures, interminablesessions in Child’s Restaurant. Gurdjieff also read the manuscript ofOuspensky’s book, and prepared his own Beelzebub for publication; he admiredOuspensky’s work, but insisted that Beelzebub was a better source book of histeaching.Child’s Restaurant was the scene of one of his last displays of ‘magical’ power.Bennett was in New York, and went to join Gurdjieff in Child’s one morning.Gurdjieff told him to take a sheet of paper and write. Bennett found his handwriting automatically, in a style that was not his own. It was an announcementof the forthcoming publication of Beelzebub, and a request that as many pupilsas possible should buy copies at £100 per copy. Later that day, Gurdjieff readthe letter aloud to a gathering of pupils, many of whom commented that no onebut Gurdjieff could have written it.Gurdjieff returned to Paris the following spring. Kenneth Walker noticed thathis health was deteriorating seriously, and advised him to have an operation toremove fluid from his abdomen. Gurdjieff apparently ignored this advice.Bennett also continued to see him regularly, and found that Gurdjieff was asdemanding as ever. Bennett stretched himself to breaking point to meetimpossible requests, until it suddenly dawned on him that this was another ofGurdjieff’s ‘tricks’. Bennett’s problem was an inability to say no, andGurdjieff was trying to teach him to develop it. When this realization came tohim, he experienced immense relief.Once again, with Gurdjieff’s help, Bennett began having unusual experiences.When reading aloud before the evening meal at Gurdjieff’s flat, he suddenly lefthis body and stood several feet away, listening to his voice continuing to read.After that, he experienced a return of the ability to command his emotionalstates at will; he also discovered that he could be aware of events happening inother places. One day, to confirm this, he rang his wife in London, and verifiedthat she had been at a certain meeting with women friends, as he had seen duringhis state of ‘clairvoyance’.In October, when Bennett returned to Paris, it was clear that Gurdjieff was nowvery ill. Eighteen months before, he had been involved in another car accidentthat had caused serious damage; Bennett had then been impressed by the vitalitythat prevented him from dying. Now, with his legs swollen with dropsy, he seemedto have no more will to live. Bennett found him sitting in a café on the morningof Saturday, 22 October 1949, looking ill and tired. He told Bennett: ‘The nextfive years will decide. It is the beginning of a new world. Either the old worldwill make me “Tchik” (making a sound like a louse being squashed) or I will make(i.e. squash) the old world. “Tchik”. Then the new world can begin.’ Whichsuggests that Gurdjieff expected to live for at least another five years.Bennett drove home with him in his car, an act of considerable courage, forGurdjieff was always an atrocious driver, and now his legs were so swollen thathe was unable to use the brake. Crossing the Avenue Carnot, a lorry swept downtowards them; Gurdjieff continued at the same pace, missing it by a hair’sbreadth. In order to stop the car outside his flat, he had to allow it to rundown.Four days later, Gurdjieff’s American doctor saw him, and ordered him moved tothe American hospital. His blood pressure was too high to inject serum. Theenormous quantity of liquid was drained off from his stomach, but it wasapparently too late. By the following Saturday, 29 October, he was dead. Thereseemed to be some doubt even about that. Four hours after his death, hisforehead was still warm. And when Bennett stood alone beside the body in thechapel of the American Hospital, he could hear someone breathing—even when heheld his breath and closed his eyes. He suspected Gurdjieff of a last practicaljoke.When the autopsy was performed, the doctors were baffled. His intestines were insuch a state of disintegration and decay that he should have been dead yearsago.1 This technique—of transmitting healing power through water—is well known to‘spirit healers’, and in recent years, experiments have suggested that an actualchange takes place in the molecular structure of the water."},{"pageContent":"7—GURDJIEFF VERSUS OUSPENSKY?Beelzebub’s Tales to his Grandson, which Gurdjieff regarded as the essence ofhis teaching, is over twelve hundred pages long. Ouspensky’s In Search of theMiraculous, undoubtedly the best summary of Gurdjieff’s ideas, is over fourhundred. Even for the intelligent and well-disposed reader, this represents aconsiderable problem. According to Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, it is an inescapableproblem. The length demands from the reader a certain effort which isindispensable if the ideas are to be grasped and digested, rather than merelyswallowed whole.Yet Ouspensky’s own book amounts to a compromise with his original position,that the ideas could only be conveyed directly, from teacher to pupil, and thatany attempt to convey them in writing would dilute their very essence, and sofalsify them.What bothered Ouspensky was the modern tendency to simplify important ideas forpopular consumption: Relativity Made Easy, Kant for Beginners. But he wasoverlooking a vital point: that such books are not necessarily for the lazy. Ifyou intend to try to learn about Kant or relativity from scratch, you wouldundoubtedly do better to start with a simplified account rather than trying toplunge direct into The Critique of Pure Reason or Einstein’s collectedmathematical papers.With this in mind, then, let us see whether it is possible to make the approachto Gurdjieff less formidable.We might well begin with the conflict between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. Bennettwrites: ‘Gurdjieff frequently complained that Ouspensky had ruined his pupils byhis excessively intellectual approach, and that he [Gurdjieff] did better withpeople who came to him with no preparation at all.’ And we have already notedKenneth Walker’s observation that Ouspensky had made them too rigid and grim.Bennett quotes Ouspensky as telling his pupils that ‘all in London should makesure to avoid the smallest departure from the letter of the System as containedin the writings I have left.’ When Bennett sent Ouspensky a paper he had writtenin the fifth dimension, Ouspensky dismissed it with the remark: ‘Nothing new canbe found by intellectual processes alone. There is only one hope: that we shouldfind the way to work with the higher emotional centre.’ And he added the sadcomment: ‘And we do not know how this is to be done.’In short, Ouspensky’s basic approach is curiously pessimistic and negative. Hebelieves that the ‘System’ is man’s only salvation from his ‘mechanicalness’,from his complete inability to ‘do’. But he feels that the road is tremendouslysteep and difficult. Bennett’s wife told him: ‘You do not trust yourself, andthat is not good ... Why don’t you follow your own line more, and stop trying toimitate Mr Ouspensky?’ She recognized that this was the trouble—Ouspensky’sgloomy, almost Calvinistic attitude to the ‘System’.Gurdjieff’s approach was altogether more optimistic. He told his Prieuréstudents: ‘Every man can achieve this independent mind: everyone who has aserious wish can do it.’ There is no suggestion here that the path is toodifficult for all but the most desperate or determined; a serious wish wasenough—the kind of seriousness you would have to bring to learning a foreignlanguage or studying mathematics.Yet from descriptions of life at the Prieuré, it seems clear that Gurdjieffhimself was at least partly responsible for Ouspensky’s attitude. The immensephysical efforts required of the disciples, the fasts, the rebukes and emotionalshocks, all seem to imply that freedom from ‘mechanicalness’ demands an almostsuperhuman dedication. And Bennett himself had his doubts. He writes: ‘But inspite of these results there was something not right. It was too frenzied, wewere all in too much of a hurry ... We all wanted to run before we could walk.’And, however hesitantly, Bennett blames Gurdjieff:> Looking back, it seems Gurdjieff was still experimenting. He wanted to see> what European people were capable of. He discovered that we were prepared to> make efforts that few Asiatic people will accept—for the simple reason that on> the whole Asiatic people are not in a hurry. The difference is deceptive and> it may be that Gurdjieff misjudged the capacity for effort, and took it for> ability to accept the need for inward change. As I see it now, we did not> really grasp the profound change of attitude towards oneself that is needed> before the process of the ‘Work’ can act freely in us. We were perhaps misled> by Gurdjieff’s insistence on effort and yet more effort.Now, as all the major religious teachers have recognized, excessive effort canin itself be counter-productive. For the ‘I’ that makes the effort is theanxiety-ridden left-brain ego. This conscious ‘will’ is hampered by its ownself-awareness. The ‘true will’ seems to operate from elsewhere—from the realmof ‘essence’—which, as Gurdjieff says, is located elsewhere in the brain. And itis actually repressed and rendered non-operative by the fussy anxiety of theleft-brain ‘personality’.If this is, in fact, a valid criticism—not only of Ouspensky’s approach but ofGurdjieff’s—then it suggests that the ‘System’ was not as complete or final asOuspensky liked to believe. No one had any doubt that it worked. Leadingfollowers like Ouspensky, Bennett, Orage, de Hartmann, Walker, have left us inno doubt about that. Yet it seems equally clear that all of them ended with acertain sense of unfulfilment, as if they had somehow failed to gain what hadoriginally been promised. Accounts of Ouspensky’s last years make it clear thathe was a tired and sad man. Bennett was struck by Gurdjieff’s sadness when hesaw him after twenty five years, and this sadness can be seen in all the laterphotographs.It may seem naive to expect that the ‘Work’ should bring about the same kind ofinner transformation—complete with visions and ecstasies—of religiousconversion. Yet it does seem reasonable to expect it to bring about some degreeof inner satisfaction and serenity. And accounts by various Gurdjieff disciplesmake it clear that it failed even in this respect. The problem of why thisshould be so presents an interesting challenge. At all events, it is worthexamining more closely.Perhaps the best way of beginning is to try to re-define the question whichGurdjieff’s ‘System’ attempts to solve.Everyday consciousness is limited by ‘mechanicalness’, ‘the robot’. We become soaccustomed to the repetitive routine of everyday life that we end by being boundhand and foot by habit, like a fly wrapped in spider-web. Yet no one, even thelaziest, is really happy with this state of affairs, for we recognize that itrobs us of a certain intensity, a feeling of being fully alive. We needsecurity; but it tends to conflict with that desire to be ‘wide awake’. This ismore often associated with insecurity. Sartre, for example, remarked that he hadnever felt so alive as when he was in the French Resistance, and was likely tobe arrested and shot at any moment.This conflict produces the problem that I have identified as ‘the dilemma of theOutsider’. Dominant human beings prefer insecurity and intensity to security andboredom. Of course, even the less dominant ones hanker after ‘intensity’; butthey are unwilling to trade it for security. The ideal state of affairs foreveryone would be a combination of security and intensity. This has, in fact,been the basic aim of all the major religions. For example, a monastery is aplace whose walls guarantee security, but whose inhabitants are dedicated tospiritual intensity through discipline and prayer. Throughout history, prophets,saints and spiritual teachers have addressed themselves to this problem: toprescribe a mode of life that combines ‘wide awakeness’ with a reasonable degreeof security and normality.Extreme solutions have never been popular. The Buddha turned his back on theharsher forms of yogic discipline. The Fathers of the Church have always frownedon ‘enthusiasm’ (i.e. fanaticism) and have burnt some of its more notoriousadvocates. The trouble is that the less extreme solutions—those that made roomfor human timidity and laziness—have always been just as unsatisfactory in thelong run. Man seems to be driven by a deep-rooted craving to escape his normallimitations.Gurdjieff’s method is remarkable for the scientific precision of its approach tothe problem of mechanicalness. We need security in order to realize our creativepotentialities, since a man without security can think of nothing but where hisnext meal is coming from. But security causes a certain automatic relaxation,precisely analogous to the way that a hypnotist can send a good trance subjectto sleep with a snap of his fingers. Recent experiments with sensorydeprivation—in the ‘black room’—have demonstrated this even more clearly.Deprived of all external stimuli, the mind not only falls asleep; it literallydisintegrates. We are held together by external challenges and problems.Deprived of these, we drift apart, like a raft whose ropes have been cut.Theoretically, the answer is simple enough. We must de-hypnotize ourselves,devise ropes that will continue to hold even when we have achieved security;inner bonds that will hold even when the external bonds have dissolved.Gurdjieff decided that the answer lay in what might be called ‘artificialinsecurity’—not hair shirts and beds of nails, but intellectual efforts,physical disciplines, emotional shocks. It was a combination of the way of thefakir, the monk and the yogi—physical, intellectual and emotional effort. ButGurdjieff also recognized the need for a ‘fourth way’, which he called the wayof the ‘cunning man’. This is the man who has a certain precise knowledge, andwho uses this ‘inside information’ to gain his end. That is to say, Gurdjieffwas aware that mere brute force and effort are not the whole answer. In spite ofwhich, the emphasis in the ‘System’ swung inevitably towards ‘effort and yetmore effort’.In the case of Ouspensky, it is easy to see what went wrong. His starting pointwas his insistence on man’s mechanicalness, his total inability to act or ‘todo’. In fact, man’s mechanicalness—or bondage—is not the starting point, eitherof Gurdjieff’s System or any other. If we were mechanical all the time, we wouldfeel no need to search for ‘freedom’. The real starting point is the glimpse offreedom—the moments of intensity, of ‘wide-awakeness’—what Abraham Maslow calls‘the peak experience’. These are what make us dissatisfied with our ordinarystates of consciousness.The next thing we note is that we experience glimpses of freedom every time someproblem or emergency galvanizes us to a sense of urgency. This became the centreof gravity of Gurdjieff’s method: to train his pupils to a permanent sense ofurgency. Beelzebub tells his grandson that the only way mankind can be saved isby developing an ‘organ’ which would enable us to grasp the inevitability of ourown death, and of the death of everyone around us. The point is underlined inthe fragment of a lost story (described by Bennett) about a man who wakes upafter dying ‘and realizes that he had lost the chief instrument of his life, hisbody, and recalls all he could have done with it while he was still alive.’One way of creating this sense of emergency is to seek out challenge. GrahamGreene has described how, as a bored teenager, he played Russian roulette with aloaded revolver; when the hammer clicked on an empty chamber, ‘it was as if alight had been turned on ... and I felt that life contained an infinite numberof possibilities.’ Greene had chosen a rather dangerous way of ‘shaking the mindawake’, but his experience makes us clearly aware that the mind (or the brain)contains a mechanism for getting rid of the robot and waking us up. It can beswitched on, like a light.A little ‘self-observation’ makes us aware that this ‘mechanism’ could also becompared to a powerful coiled spring inside the brain. When we are galvanized bya sense of emergency or excitement, some deep source of will inside us winds thespring up tight, and we experience a sense of power and control.Unfortunately, this ‘spring’ is only partly within our conscious control—thecontrol of the ‘personality’. It lies in the realm of that ‘other self’—whatGurdjieff calls essence. The ‘personality’ lacks authority to convince this‘other self’ of its seriousness. The spring responds to what might be called‘the vibration of seriousness’. This is why a hypnotist—the voice of outsideauthority—can persuade it to make efforts that are far beyond the power of theconscious will. Significantly, Gurdjieff understood the nature of hypnosis—aproblem that still baffles modern psychology; he defines it as the suspension of‘false consciousness’, the ‘ruling master of their common presence’, so that‘genuine consciousness’ can make itself felt.1 That is to say, it is thesuspension of ‘left-brain consciousness’ (which, as Gurdjieff recognized, is theruling ego of our double-consciousness), so that the far more powerfulright-brain consciousness can express itself without interference.This left-brain consciousness is both man’s greatest triumph and his undoing.With its logical precision it has enabled him to create civilization, as well asthe immense body of modern scientific knowledge. But in order to operate at fullefficiency, it requires the backing of man’s ‘other’ being—instinctive orintuitive consciousness. This explains why we feel most ‘alive’ when we areengaged in some important activity, something that gives us a sense of crisis oremergency. Then that ‘other self’ gives left-brain consciousness its fullbacking and support. But if I watch television for too long, or try to read along book in a single sitting, I begin to experience an odd sense of unreality.I feel ‘lightweight’, unreal. This is because our ‘other self’ has decided thatno backing is required; we are dealing with unrealities, so it feels it can gooff duty.This, then, defines our problem. In this world of trivial emergencies andunimportant decisions, man has developed a reliance on left-brain consciousnessthat dominates his existence. He has become so accustomed to this ‘lightweight’consciousness, with its accompanying sense of unreality, that he has almostforgotten what ‘real consciousness’ is like. His ‘other self’ is almostpermanently off-duty.How can it be persuaded to return to its proper work of ‘backing’ left-brainconsciousness? Many methods have been suggested. D. H. Lawrence thought sex wasthe answer. Hemingway advocated ‘adventure’—big game hunting, bullfighting, andso on. But Gurdjieff saw that these are insufficient. That ‘other self’ has tobe galvanized and shaken awake again and again, day after day. The ‘personality’(left-brain consciousness) has to be undermined by crisis and unexpectedchallenges. Knowledge is also important, of course—understanding of themechanisms of the ‘computer’. But theoretical knowledge once again strengthensthe rational ego—what Lawrence called ‘head consciousness’. So the correctsolution is a balanced diet—theoretical knowledge carefully mixed with ‘effort’.This was Gurdjieff’s solution, and it was transformed into a rigid system byOuspensky.Gurdjieff himself perceived the dangers of rigidity. He recognized that inmatters as difficult and complicated as this—the attempt to understand themystery of man’s inner-being—language can easily betray us. It is necessary tokeep an open mind, and approach the problem from many different angles. Theresult is that anyone who reads Gurdjieff’s three books, then turns to accountsof his lectures by disciples, will often find himself puzzled by contradictions.These contradictions are a proof that Gurdjieff was not the recipient of somemysterious ‘ancient wisdom’, which he passed on to his followers like the tablesof the law. He was a psychologist of genius, whose insight was continuallydeveloping. His basic recognition was that man is a vast computer, with manylevels of control. At present, he has so little control of this vast machinethat he is virtually its slave. But theoretically, he could achieve totalcontrol. And since the resources of the computer seem greater than anyone hasever imagined, he could, in theory, become a kind of god.His basic task therefore, is, to know the computer. This is not too difficult—intheory, at least. It merely requires constant self-observation. But the secondtask is far more difficult. Self-observation is best carried out in states ofinsight and intensity, states when the ‘two consciousnesses’ are in harmony andin close co-operation. How can we induce these states at will? If there was somesimple method, man’s problems would be at an end. If, for example, he couldachieve it through sex, or bullfighting, or by swallowing some drug, then hewould have solved the major problem of his evolution. Unfortunately, to judge bytheir advocates, none of these methods can give long-term satisfaction.And what of Gurdjieff’s ‘System’? This can certainly show far more spectacularresults. Yet, as we have seen, it could also involve his pupils in a great dealof misery, exhaustion and confusion. And for many of them, the end result wasnot as satisfying as they might have wished. Bennett, for example, later becamea disciple of the Indonesian ‘messiah’ Pakh Subuh, and after that a RomanCatholic—a fairly clear indication that the ‘system’ left certain aspects of hisnature unfulfilled.So far in this book, I have deliberately kept my own views and attitudes in thebackground; but at this point it becomes necessary to admit that, after nearlythree decades of absorbing Gurdjieff’s ideas, I feel that there were a number ofsmall but important points which that master of self-observation failed to takeinto account.Gurdjieff’s enormous emphasis on man’s ‘mechanicalness’, and the difficulties ofescaping it even for a moment, seems to imply that moments of‘non-mechanicalness’ are rare or non-existent. In fact, as I have pointed out,this is untrue. Human beings are always experiencing flashes of ‘awakeness’,glimpses of freedom. T. E. Lawrence describes one of them in Seven Pillars ofWisdom:> We started on one of those clear dawns that wake up the senses with the sun,> while the intellect, tired after the thinking of the night, was yet abed. For> an hour or two, on such a morning, the sounds, scents and colours of the world> struck man individually and directly, not filtered through or made typical by> thought; they seemed to exist sufficiently by themselves.In effect, the left-brain (the ‘intellect’) was still asleep; so Lawrence was ina state analogous to hypnosis, in which the right-brain could perceive thingsdirectly, unimpeded by his ‘thought riddled nature’. Moments like this are notrare; children experience them all the time, as Wordsworth pointed out; and evenafter the ‘shades of the prison house’ have begun to close, healthy people stillexperience them with reasonable frequency as moments of ‘optimistic expectancy’,‘peak experiences’.The most interesting thing about these ‘glimpses’ is what might be called their‘meaning content’. Greene says that when his revolver failed to explode ‘it wasas if a light had been turned on ... and I felt that life contains an infinitenumber of possibilities.’ And this is common to all such experiences. Theyproduce a sense of revelation, of ‘absurd good news’, a feeling that the worldis infinitely more meaningful than we normally give it credit for. The reason isclear. We normally ‘see’ the world through the dark-glasses of the rational ego.(The ‘I’ inside my head lives in the left-brain.) When we accidentally removethe dark glasses, we are startled by the vistas of forgotten meaning that burstupon us. Clearly, this precise and fussy left-brain leaves a great deal out ofaccount. And it is because it leaves so much out of account that it is sosubject to pessimism. And this is what is wrong with ordinary consciousness.This is why we are slaves of the robot. Ordinary consciousness involves anin-built assumption of lack of meaning. And it is the lack of meaning thattriggers the sleep mechanism. (When you feel there is nothing to look forwardto, you become bored and sleepy.) If we could switch on meaning at will, asGreene switched it on with his Russian roulette, the problem of ‘sleep’ wouldvanish. Meaning would awaken us far more effectively than any amount of violentand exhausting effort. Meaning instantly creates energy. If only we could locatethe switch of the ‘light’ that Greene turned on by squeezing the trigger.But in expressing the problem in this way, we are leaving an important factorout of account. Man’s ‘two consciousnesses’ are interconnected. The consciousand the unconscious do not operate as separate entities; neither do the rightand left halves of the brain.It is important to understand the way that ‘negativeness’ operates. When I wakeup in the morning, it is my rational ego that confronts the world. If ‘I’ seethat it is raining outside, and remember that I have a dental appointment, andthat my bank manager wants to talk to me about my overdraft, my ‘heart sinks’.So does my energy. When I am happy and full of eager expectancy, a spring ofenergy bubbles up from my unconscious mind; meaning creates energy. Conversely,when I feel gloomy and discouraged, my energy seems to drain away. The resultantsense of fatigue deepens my sense of discouragement; and this—unless somethingintervenes to cheer me up—deepens my fatigue. That is to say, there is an effectof negative feedback between my ‘two selves’.If, on the contrary, I wake up to bright sunlight, and remember that in a fewhours time I shall be setting out on holiday, my rational ego reacts with achortle of satisfaction, and I experience the beginning of a pleasant inwardglow. ‘Positive feedback’ has been established.What we observe here is that although it is the ‘unconscious’ that controls theenergy supply, its decisions are entirely governed by the suggestions of the‘rational ego’. If I happen to be a weak and self-pitying sort of person, mostof these suggestions will be negative, and I shall feel exhausted and depressedmuch of the time. If I am a cheerful and rational sort of person, my unconsciouswill respond to positive suggestions, my sense of meaning, by keeping me wellprovided with energy. Moreover, this energy will have the effect of making theworld look a happier and brighter place—making me see more meaning—thusconfirming my optimism.When we consider modern humanity in general, one thing stands out fairlyclearly: that our basic attitude towards existence tends to be negative, tingedwith distrust. This indicates that most of us have fallen into the habit of‘negative feedback’. There seems to be good reason for this: modern life isdifficult and complex; humanity faces many problems. But anyone who hasunderstood Gurdjieff’s ideas will know that these ‘reasons’ are irrelevant. Itwould be equally true to say that mankind is now happier and more comfortablethan it has ever been. The real issue is our habit of negation.Gurdjieff taught that this habit is stupid and unnecessary. The really importantthing about man is that he possesses a possibility of real freedom, once he hasgrasped the fact that, at the moment, his life is almost entirely mechanical. Hemust turn the searchlight of his reason, his analytical processes, upon all hisunconscious assumptions.And it is when we turn the searchlight upon the contrasted activities of our‘two consciousnesses’ that we grasp a fundamental truth about human existence—atruth, I suspect, that Gurdjieff only partly understood. The rational ego tendsto be pessimistic because it sees things too close up. This is like trying todecide on the merits of a large picture by examining the canvas through amagnifying glass or microscope. In fact, such an examination, no matter howconscientious, would fail to reveal what the painter had put into the picture.Right-brain consciousness, on the other hand, deals in terms of meanings, ofoverall patterns. And, as we have seen, undiluted right-brain consciousnessalways produces the feeling of sheer delight, of ‘absurd good news’.In short, the ‘worm’s-eye view’ of the left-brain is negative by nature. The‘bird’s eye view’ of the right-brain is positive by nature, revealing vistas ofmeaning and interconnectedness that are invisible to the worm.Our practical problem, the problem we confront every day of our lives, is todecide which of the two is telling the truth. But unless we understood that oneof them deals in ‘immediacy perception’ and the other in ‘meaning perception’,we have no means of weighing their testimony. To begin with, it is theleft-brain that tries to do the weighing. Second, the ‘moments of vision’ are somuch rarer than moments of boredom and discouragement that, on purelyarithmetical grounds, we are inclined to believe the negative testimony. Butwhat we need to know is that the ‘rational ego’, for all its logic and clarityof perception, is essentially a microscope, which can only see things piecemeal.The ‘other self’ may have no power of self-expression, but it has aninstantaneous grasp of meanings. Once we know this, there can be no possibledoubt about which testimony we accept. The left is not fundamentally a liar, butits partial-vision leads it to incorrect inferences about the world. It is inthe position of the blind beggars in Ramakrishna’s parable, who try to describean elephant by the sense of touch alone.Then there is the most convincing piece of evidence of all: that when the rightand left achieve one of their infrequent moods of harmony—those strange, relaxedmoments that seem to combine insight with intellectual excitement—the left istotally convinced that the right was correct all along. It now sees clearly thatits pessimism was based on false interpretation of insufficient facts; there isa sense of direct revelation that can only be expressed in the words: ‘Ofcourse!’Yet since the left is, by nature, limited to piecemeal perception, the problemseems insoluble—until we realize that this is a problem we solve every day ofour lives. The left is, in fact, continually accepting truths that run counterto its own perceptions. Immediacy perception tells it that the sun goes roundthe earth and that the earth is flat; but it has no difficulty in accepting theCopernican theory. Immediacy-perception tells it that a book is atwo-dimensional object; yet it takes it for granted that it has three.What is even more to the point is that the left’s perceptions tell it that abook is merely a combination of paper and black ink; yet it knows perfectly wellthat a book has yet another dimension—that what matters about the book is itscontent, its meaning. A child who loves reading feels an immediate lift of theheart, a kind of instinctive delight, at the sight of a book. But it is notinstinctive; it is ‘taught’. The left may be a sceptic by nature, but it is abeliever by training.All this implies that the outcome of Gurdjieff’s ideas could be more importantand exciting than Gurdjieff himself ever realized. He devoted his life tosolving the problem of how to re-unite the ‘two consciousnesses’, so thatessence and personality could develop in harmony. He devised all kinds ofmethods for shaking ‘essence’ into a state of wakefulness, so as to rescue theego from its sense of absurdity and unreality. He failed to realize that wealready possess a faculty for doing it spontaneously. The mind does not need tobe shaken awake; it can be educated awake. All that is required is a change ofattitude. The rational ego has acquired a deeply-ingrained habit of mistrust.Western man receives his ‘melting moods’, his ‘moments of vision’, with acertain scepticism, as if they were related to being drunk. Understanding of thedifferent functions of the ‘two consciousnesses’ enables us to see that thismistrust is unnecessary. The ‘moments of vision’ were telling the truth allalong. The moment we really grasp this—rationally and logically, as we graspthat the earth is round—we shall begin to see the vision of infinite possibilitythat Greene experienced as he played Russian roulette; but as a steadily-heldinsight, not a sudden glimpse.Greene’s experience underlines another point to which Gurdjieff paidinsufficient attention. The brain possesses a mechanism for freeing us from therobot—a mechanism that I have compared to a powerful coiled spring. If I try tocontract this ‘spring’ by an act of will, by sheer concentration, I find theeffort painful and exhausting. A sudden crisis is far more effective. Yet thereally important recognition is that I can contract it by a determined effort ofwill. The mental ‘muscle’ I use for this purpose is undeveloped. But all musclescan be developed. In fact, if I make a habit of deliberately contracting this‘muscle’ of attention or concentration, my ability to make use of the ‘spring’quickly begins to develop.And at this point, it becomes possible to answer with more precision thequestion: how can the right-brain be persuaded to return to its proper task of‘backing’ left-brain consciousness? The solution lies in the fact thatright-brain consciousness moves at a far more leisurely pace than the left. Theleft is always in a hurry. Which explains why it reduces the world to symbols,to flat, two-dimensional surfaces. If I glance at something quickly, I take inonly its surface characteristics.If, when I am in a hurry, something suddenly arrests my attention and arouses myinterest, I immediately slow down, just as I would slow down in a car if Ipassed through interesting scenery. And this mental act of slowing-down has theimmediate effect of revealing fine shades of meaning that I had previously beenin too much of a hurry to notice.In fact, man invented art specifically for this purpose of slowing him down. Youcannot enjoy a picture gallery or a symphony concert without ‘unwinding’ andgiving your full attention to the pictures or music.And what happens when I ‘slow down’ and become deeply absorbed in a book orpiece of music? That ‘other dimension’ of meaning begins to open up. I suddenlybecome aware of my own feelings, my inner-states, at the same time that I amabsorbed in the book or symphony, i.e. I achieve a state of self-rememberingnaturally and without undue effort. And an interesting phenomenon occurs. If Ithink of the ‘me’ of an hour ago, rushing along through the crowds, tense withanxiety, I find myself looking back on him with a kind of pitying superiority. Ino longer feel identified with him. My ‘personal centre of gravity’ has movedfrom the left to the right. I am now ‘identifying’ with this more relaxed,perceptive self.All this is not to say that the answer lies simply in ‘relaxation’. Ordinaryrelaxation does not have the effect of moving the ‘personal centre of gravity’.What is important here is the mental act that causes the slowing-down. I slowdown because I am deeply interested, because my total attention is demanded,(e.g. imagine a man defusing an unexploded bomb.) Moreover, the slowing-downprocess also involves that ‘spring’ that controls our energy supply. To make adeliberate and determined effort of will is to automatically slow down. And, infact, the slowing-down process can be achieved by a deliberate effort of willedconcentration.It is immensely important to grasp that relaxation in itself is not the point.The point is the motive behind the relaxation: the recognition that our ordinaryperception does not disclose the reality of the world. If you suspected that astranger on a train was someone you knew, wearing some kind of disguise, youwould stare intently, trying to penetrate the disguise. Here, the basis of the‘mental act’ would be your suspicion that your ordinary perception is deceivingyou, and the consequent desire to deepen your perception. It is an act that weinstinctively perform when we experience intense pleasure: the desire to apply abrake to the usual headlong flow of consciousness.Once this perception of ‘another dimension’ has been achieved, there is aninstant sense of relief, and an immediate flow of vitality, a feeling ofrenewal. Meaning summons energy. In this state, we can recognize clearly how our‘ordinary consciousness’ runs-down our energies without replenishing them. Themoment consciousness is connected to meaning, the revitalizing process begins.It can be seen why Gurdjieff’s emphasis on ‘effort and yet more effort’ wascounter-productive. Which still leaves a puzzling question: how did apsychologist as penetrating as Gurdjieff come to overlook the crucial importanceof the slowing-down process, the focus upon meaning? The answer, I think, liesin the opening chapter of Beelzebub,2 where he speaks of the nature of man’s‘two independent consciousnesses’. He goes on to identify these as ‘mechanical’consciousness created by experience (i.e. the robot) and man’s ‘hereditary’ orinstinctive consciousness. (He adds that this hereditary consciousness is whatwe call the ‘subconscious’, and that it ought to be our real consciousness.) Itcan be seen that this rough division misses the important fact that ‘mechanical’consciousness deals with ‘immediacy’, while the other type is concerned withoverall patterns and meanings.The misconception is deepened in the chapter in which he speaks about ‘the organKundabuffer’—Beelzebub’s explanation of how man came to be so entrapped inillusion. Gurdjieff explains that a commission of archangels became worried incase man developed ‘objective reason’, and so came to object to this basicpurpose on this planet, to provide ‘food for the moon’. They decided to avertthis possibility by planting in man an organ called Kundabuffer, which woulddistort his perception and cause him to mistake illusion for reality. This couldbe regarded as Gurdjieff’s own version of the legend of original sin, Newman’s‘primeval catastrophe’ in which the whole human race is implicated.But, as we have seen, it is not a question of illusion—merely of the partialperception of the rational ego. Close-upness deprives us of meaning. In creatinga legend of illusion or sin, Gurdjieff has given his philosophy a pessimisticorientation. This is emphasized by the story of the sheep and the magician,quoted by Ouspensky.3 The magician was too mean to hire shepherds; so hehypnotized his sheep, suggesting to them that they were immortal, so that noharm was being done to them when they were skinned; on the contrary, they wouldenjoy it. They were also told that the magician was a good master who loved hisflock. These suggestions kept the sheep docile until they were ready for thebutchers. This, added Gurdjieff, is a very good illustration of man’s position.So again, the philosophy is cast into a pessimistic mould. The need to escapebecomes a matter of extreme emergency, a matter for ‘effort and yet moreeffort’.Which bring us to an altogether more personal and delicate question. LikeGurdjieff’s disciples at the Prieuré, I have also found myself puzzling aboutGurdjieff’s lifelong accident-proneness. Generally speaking, it is the unhappyor self-divided people who are accident-prone. It is as if a powerful sense ofpurpose generated an intuitive defence system. It is true that Gurdjieff was anappalling driver; yet his two most serious accidents seem to have been throughno fault of his own.The accident-proneness seems to me to be connected with his tendency to involvehimself with large numbers of people. Of course, he saw this as the only logicalway to convey his teaching; yet all his attempts to set up an institute ended indisaster. The war and then the revolution closed down the Russian institute. TheAtaturk revolution drove him out of Turkey. The German revolution frustrated thehope of a Berlin institute. The British Home Office put an end to the hope of aninstitute in Hampstead. With immense difficulty, Gurdjieff acquired thePrieuré—only to see his hopes undermined by his car accident in less than twoyears. At last he was forced to do what he should have considered many yearsbefore—write down his ideas. The result was two extraordinary works—Beelzebuband Meetings With Remarkable Men. But he abandoned Life Is Real Only Then, When‘I Am’ when it was less than half-completed, and went back to the exhaustingdrudgery of teaching his ideas direct. The reading of Beelzebub—described byWilliam Seabrook—makes it clear that he hoped that his writings would make animmediate impact. Unfortunately, the total incomprehension of ordinary literatepeople convinced him that this was not the answer.If, in fact, Ouspensky had published In Search of the Miraculous in 1930—at thetime Gurdjieff was adding the final touches to Beelzebub—there seems littledoubt that it would have made just the impact that Beelzebub failed to make. Butthen, Ouspensky’s peculiarly narrow and puritanical view of the ‘Work’ convincedhim that writing was somehow forbidden. In fact, the final publication of hisown book, as well as that of many brilliant books by others involved in the‘Work’, proved beyond all doubt that the essence of Gurdjieff’s ideas can beconveyed perfectly well on the printed page. There may, as Bennett insists, beaspects of the teaching that can only be conveyed direct from teacher tostudent; but generally speaking, Gurdjieff’s ideas gain from being read andstudied.All this, I suspect, explains why Gurdjieff struck Bennett as a sad man in hislast years. His life-work had been extraordinary; he had gone out in search of‘hidden knowledge’ and found it. The ‘System’ he brought back was, in terms ofwestern culture, of startling originality. He would have been less than human ifhe had not hoped to see these ideas make maximum impact on the world of thetwentieth century. This was not vanity; all thinkers experience a desire toconvey their ideas: it is part of the evolutionary impulse. Yet during hislifetime, Gurdjieff remained virtually unknown to most people. In Rom Landau’sGod Is My Adventure—one of the few things published about him in his lifetime—heis merely one of a gallery, which included Rudolf Steiner, Krishnamurti, ShriBaba, Dr Frank Buchman and ‘Principal’ George Jeffreys. Ironically, Ouspensky isalso given a chapter to himself; Gurdjieff receives a brief—and ratherpatronizing—mention, but there is no indication that the ‘war against sleep’ wasGurdjieff’s idea, not Ouspensky’s.This, it seems to me, was Gurdjieff’s tragedy—that he dropped the idea ofspreading his ideas by writing, and returned to the only other role he knew,that of the teacher. Accounts of his students by various writers—Fritz Peters,Margaret Anderson, Irmis Popoff—make it clear that they must have tried hispatience. On the whole, a ‘teacher’ cannot choose his pupils; he has to takewhat fate sends him. Inevitably, a large proportion are fools. A few studentslike Bennett and Ouspensky may have consoled Gurdjieff for the poor quality ofso many others; but there must have been times when he felt that fate hadsaddled him with a particularly heavy cross. As a published writer, Gurdjieffcould have sat back and waited for people to come to him; as it was, he did itthe hard way. His optimism was immense, his vitality tremendous. Yet it seemsthat he had to console himself with large quantities of Armagnac and big blackcigars. He was the kind of man one would expect to live to be ninety; instead,he died in his early seventies. At the time of his death, he must still havewondered whether his ideas would survive. Within five years, there could be nopossible doubt about it. It was Gurdjieff’s bad luck that he never knew how farhe had succeeded.If Gurdjieff’s ideas could be summarized in a sentence, it would be that man islike a grandfather clock driven by a watch-spring. Or like an enormous watermill driven by a muddy trickle of water. The strange paradox is that in spite ofthe inadequacy of his driving force, an enormous and complex mechanism alreadyseems to exist. Like a ladder, man consists of many levels. The problem, then,is clear: to increase the driving force. Man may be more than half mechanical;but he can choose whether to live in a blank, hypnotized state, or whether tolive as though some immense unguessed meaning lay on the other side of thiscurtain of everyday reality, waiting to reveal itself to a sense of purpose.Gurdjieff’s ‘System’ is probably the greatest single-handed attempt in thehistory of human thought to make us aware of the potential of humanconsciousness. Whether he realized it or not, his life-work had achieved itspurpose.1 ‘An omission from p 568 of Beelzebub’— Guide and Index to All and Everything,p 673.2 Pages 24 and 25.3 In Search of the Miraculous, p 219."},{"pageContent":"[../Images/main-6.jpg] The Prieuré from the Lime Avenue [../Images/main-7.jpg]Gurdjieff in later life [../Images/main-8.jpg] Gurdjieff’s ‘Kosshah’ in theStudy House at the Prieuré [../Images/main-9.jpg] J.

He attracted legends as easily as disciples.But behind the Gurdjieff myth lies a solid corpus of thought, the importance ofwhich is only now being generally recognised. At its heart was the idea of ‘thewar against sleep'—the fact that man, in Colin Wilson’s words, is like ‘agrandfather clock driven by a watch-spring’.This brilliant examination of ‘a psychologist of genius, whose insight wascontinually developing’ is the most important succinct account of Gurdjieff’slife and work that has yet appeared. It is a frank evaluation based on ColinWilson’s long acquaintance with ‘The Work’ and with the ever-expanding Gurdjieffliterature.Gurdjieff’s influence as a teacher and psychological theorist is assessed andhis pioneering work on liberating the potential of human consciousness isanalysed here with the skill and depth of insight characteristic of the authorof The Outsider. The result is a definitive introduction to the philosophy ofGurdjieff for the general reader as well as distinguished original contributionto Gurdjieff studies.Cover photograph courtesy of Imperial Antiques-Chislehurst.Full catalogue sent on requestTHE AQUARIAN PRESS LIMITEDWellingborough, Northamptonshire"}]
