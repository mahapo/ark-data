For who was Moses? And what was Moses? A historical figure or a myth? And if the latter, with what motives did the mythmakers start to weave their glittering fabric? In the case of Moses we even begin with an enigma: the mysterious child abandoned in the bulrushes. In the case of Gurdjieff, the situation is not much different. A biographer in search of the authentic Gurdjieff begins by suspecting a campaign of mystification-and to some extent he may continue to hold this opinion. Part of the difficulty is that there has never been a book written about Gurdjieff and his followers by, someone not personally involved in their activities; and the grinding of axes among the Master's successors has resulted in much of what has been written being-either deliberately or unconsciously-distorted. Ten years ago J. B. Priestley appealed in his Man and Time for an assessment by an independent writer. This is the first att«;lmpt to provide such a book, and at the same time to tell a fascinating story before the possibilities of telling it are obliterated fo rever. The book is largely based on unpublished documents and interviews- some with people now dead; it seeks also to place in historical context the extensive and confu sing body of literature concerning Gurdj ieff, Ouspensky, Orage and their leading followers. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE There are peculiar difficulties in the way of the would-be independent critic of Gurdjieff. The geographical obstacles to far-flung research are considerable ; but as it was, I ranged from Austria to Tennessee. In Vienna the Keyserlings demons trated their extraordinary musi cal instrument, the Chakrap hone, until the hairs on the back of my neck rose like the hackles of a dog; in Geneva I was kindly received by Mme. de Stoerneval in her house, which had been the last home of the novelist Robert Musil; in Paris Pierre Schaeff er interrupted a busy life to spend two hours discussing the decade nce of modern musi c and the structure of the universe; whether in Lond on, New York, or Paris, I was helped on my way by a stimulating variety of people . Howeve r, in only a very fe w cases have I introduced the names of living persons whose role in events has hitherto been unknown . This is largely because the particular proble ms of gathering information about \"the Work\" involved threadi ng my way through a labyrinth of \"polit ical\" complicat ions, some of which were probably real, others, almost certainly manufactured. Some of my informants asked me not to use their names, others did not mind being mentioned, and some actually fo rbade me to use any informa­ tion without stating from what source it came. Sometimes it seemed that such requests were part of a particular game which was in progress-and the reader will have to go some way into the book before he understands what is meant. In order to eliminate such uncertainties and to avoid deploying a large cast of peripheral charac ters, I have reduced most of my informants to anonymity . The reader will have to accept my word that (to take some examples), \"a pupil of Ouspensky ,\" \"a follower of Orage, \" or \"an inmate of the Prieunf' actually exists, and my judgment of each as a reliable source of informatio n. Both the subject matter and my sources have placed certain limitations on the book, which it is the duty of a preface to indicate . Some limitations are voluntarily imposed. The music written jointly by Gurd jieff and Thomas de Hartmann and the body of dances and physical exercises known as Gurd jieff's \"movements,\" are 'not. discussed in detail . This is partly for reasons of space, but chiefly because the book is primarily a historical and biographical study concerned with certain aspects of psychology. But-to take the movements as an instance--those limitations make a virtue of necessity. I have read about the movements, talked about them, listened to the music which accompanies them, and inspected notebooks in which the sequence of positions is record ed. I think I. have a shrewd idea of what the movements are designed to achieve. But I have not practiced them myself, nor have I seen a live Pf:rforma nce or a showing of the films on which they are record ed. This is not for want of trying. Other limit ations imposed on this book come neither from the economics"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"PREFACE 13 of publishing nor the elusive quality of the subject. They result from a deliberate policy of obstruction on the part of some of Gurdjieff' s followers. There can be no real quarrel with this, because these followers are acting in complete good faith, protecting what they see as the integrity of the ideas with which they have been entrusted. There is no reason whatever for someone to cooperate in an undertaking of which he or she may thoroughly disapprove. I have been refused permission to quote from certain un­ published writings, and it is also probable that a large quantity of potentially useful information has been withheld or suppressed. Gurdjieff's successors have provided a sort of limited cooperation­ which in some cases went far beyond the bounds of anything I had a right to expect-but in others seemed like a hand proferred only to turn into a clenched fist. In addition, it was always open to my informants to transform what seemed a straightforward process of research into the kind of ambiguous situation which Gurdjieff excelled in creating. In fact, it eventually became clear that an attempt was being made to ensnare me forcibly in the sort of activities about which I had hoped to write from a detached point of view. I must admit that this attempt was temporarily successful, and I am certain that it greatly helped me to understand the nature of Gurdjieff s curious discipline. Yet the ethics of the situation continue to puzzle me. At one point I suspected that I had been manipulated into writing the sort of book which the hierarchy wanted written; at another that the attempt to engorge me in the Work was designed to ensure that no book would be written at all. While very much in debt to certain people for the pains taken on my behalf, I must remain skeptical of the good faith of others. Why all this secrecy? Partly it can be explained by the nature of the Work, which has little interest in coherent explanations, and partly as the consequence of decades of unthinking ridicule. Some followers of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky have uncomfortably thin skins and what must be a uniquely developed ability to see criticism where none is intended. This characteris­ ti c can militate against any view of the Work as a serious discipline and makes it impossible to believe in the strict accuracy of assertions made from within the movement. The resulting impression is of a morbid fear of criticism and a tendency to play fast and loose with historical fact. But to leave matters there would not be entirely fair either to Gurdjieff or to the better natures of his followers. On one level Gurdjieff was a fraud, a liar, a cheat, and a scoundrel. He also possessed compensating qualities of sympathy, compassion, charity, and an eccentric code of honor. He attempted to use the friction generated by his negative qualities. to strike fire from the hearts of his discipl es ; and Gurdjieff's successors have studied their Master's technique. Are they"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE really so insecure as to fe ar any criti cism? Do they in fact wish to canonize Gurdj ieff, Ouspensky, Orage, and Nicoll? Or, are such attitudes designed to reproduce the impression that Gurdjieff himself made on those who encountered him? The historian must separate hard historical fa ct from evidence of another sort. IndiViduals \"in the Work\" are often unreliable sources of historical informati on. On the other hand, their very equivocation makes it possible to recapture something of the uncertainty which they themselves experi­ enced when they approached the Old Magician . In the last analysis, this may he more useful than any conventional assistance. I have ther efore to acknowledge help of an unusual nature, while at the same time, the interests of future writers compel me to register doubts. The reader should be warned that-despite constant vigilance -incidents may have crept into these pages which were intended as fa bles illustrating particular points, or even as moral allegories directed at the author . Because of the circ umst ances that compelled me to choose anonymity fo r many of my informants, I cannot acknowledge some of my greate st debts ; and it would be invidious to name some who helped me while other names were absent. All I can do is offe r a general exp ression of gratitude to at least fifty people, named or unnamed, who corresponded with me, allowed me to interview them, lent me rare or unpublished material, or undertook the thankless task of critic izing my typescript. Of those debts which can be ackn owledged in conventional fa shion, I should like to thank the librarians and staffs of the University Library, Cambridge, the British Mu seum, the London Library, the Warburg Institute, University of London, the Public Record Office, the India Office Library, the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, the town library at Fon­ tainebleau, the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich, the New York Public Library, and the Special Collections Departm ent of the Library, Fisk University, Nashville, Tenne ssee. For acade mic (as distinct from Gurdjieff ­ ian) assistance, I am grateful to Drs. Phillippe Berchtold and Edmond Stadler (Geneva), Trevor Hall (Leeds), and Michael Weaver (Exeter). I am particularly indebted to Stanley Baron and France s McFadyen fo r their patient advice on the reduction of a typescript of over one thousand pages to more manageabl e proporti ons. In the pages which fo llow, a scholarly reader might object to certain inconsistencie s. Transliterations from the Russian do not always follow the sam e system: it seems unnecessary to complicate matters by transf orming P. D. Ouspensky into \"P. D. U spenskii\" becau se this spelling conf orms to a system of transliteration in general use. If a person in the story is commonly known by one particular spelling of his name, that should be sufficient reaso n for using it: one could spell \"Gurdjieff \" \"Gourdjieff ,\" or \"Gurdjiev ,\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PREFACE 15 and a more fashionable transliteration might be \"Gurdzhiev.\" Nor are Russian women's names always accurately rendered: it is clearly unnecess­ ary to call Sophia Grigorievna Ouspensky \"Ouspenskaya,\" which was her real name. The same sort of liberties have been taken with place-names in Russia and the East; in all cases I have preferred spellings used by the followers of Gurdjieif themselves. London, November 1978"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction The Invisible Man, the Impos sible Task One day in the late 1920s a ferociously driven automobile might have been seen traveling along the Paris-Orleans road. If the driver were keeping to his usual custom, the journey would have been nerve racking in the extreme; and the psasengers would be jolted, bruised, and scared as they read from a manuscript which appeared to recount the unflattering opinions of Beelzebub on the human race. It is reported that one of the captives in the car risked a glance out of the window. He saw that the road which his determined chauffeur was so wantonly traversing was dominated by a gigantic figure of Christ perched on a hilltop. He decided to risk distracting the driver from the task in hand. \"Georgeivanitch, they have put your colleague up there on the hill!\" The driver-no doubt with a number of choice imprecations-loudly demanded when he had ever said that Christ and he were colleagues. The passenger, who was the artist Alexander de Salzmann, provided chapter and verse: it had been in such and such a place- Tiflis, Constantinople, Berlin-on such and such a day. From the driver's seat came only the sound, \"Humph!\" Thirty years later the man who had been driving the car was dead, and mingled with the praises of his followers was a countercurrent of violent criticism. Certain rumors became common property: these concerned Gurdjieff's ways with women, his supposed hypnotic power , his aJleged 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 THE HARMONI OUS CIRCLE responsibility for several deaths in suspicious circumstances. A Catholic writer published what he called a \"Ceremony of Execration\" instead of an obituary. A writer in a philosophical journal declared that if Gurdjieff were not an avatar he was a skandal on-the term the early Church had used for emissaries of the devil. A more rationalist critic in Nouvelles Litter aires fought to combat this alarmism. \"He was not the devil,\" he wrote, \"but a false prophet, a pretentious ignoramus. \" If Gurdjieff seemed any of these things, it was only to certain people. For Gurdjieff was an invisible man. In 1922 this strange individual appeared in Western Europe with a band of followers whom he had rescued from the chaos of the Russian Revolution. He established himself in a chateau in the Forest of Fon­ tainebleau, where he founded something he called \"The Institute for Harmonious Development of Man.\" Writers and intellectuals were at­ tracted by Gurdji eff's ideas and the lectures which his leading follower, P. D. Ouspensky, was giving in London; and Katherine Mansfield died of tuberculosis at Fontainebleau. In 1924 Gurdjieff and his pupils traveled to New York, where they created a sensation, leaving the celebrated editor A. R. Orage behind to preach the gospel. Then, in the middle of the 1930s, Gurdjieff appeared to quarrel with all his oldest followers. He disappeared from sight until after the Second World War, when, in the few years remaining to him, he again became the enigmatic prophet who fascinated the intellectuals of Europe and America. He died in 1949, leaving behind an enormous work published under the title All and Everything: First Series , but more usually known as Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandso n. P. D. Ouspensky, who died two years earlier in England, left a record of his time with Gurdjieff in his book In Search of the Miraculous . Since its appearance in 1949, there has been a spate of literature reminiscing about Gurdjieff, whose character and teaching are perhaps more controversial today than during his lifetime. The body of activity deriving from Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Orage has become known as \"the Work,\" and it has spread to every continent and been extraordinarily influential. Neither a church nor a sect nor a school of philosophy, it is extremely difficult to define. It is also hard to be precise about its originator. However unwillingly, the biographer must recognize that understanding Gurdjie ff's \"invisibility\" is an essential part of understanding the man; worse yet, this invisibility can only become apparent as the story unfolds. Gurdjieff does not present himself as a man with a continuous life like other men. He seems more to be a collection of incidents. An old man, sitting in the sun on the terrace of a Paris cafe, or playing host to a horde of strangers in his tiny flat, a flat packed with people and hot"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 as an oven . . . a man of early middle-age with a bristling mustache, wearing an astrakhan hat and an overcoat, entertaining in a Moscow restaurant frequented by prostitutes, or sitting Oriental fashion in a St. Petersburg salon ... the same man, this time simply clothed in Caucasian dress, leading a party of terrified intellectuals through mountainous country in a state of civil war, his trousers hitched up by a fireman's belt ... the hollow-cheeked and hollow-eyed guru who enticed the famous to his Institute at Fontainebleau ... or the fox of the Levant, up to his eyes in shady financial operations, his dress untidy, spattered with food, his environs a gray snowstorm of cigarette ash, a glint of stratagem in his eye ... a Man of Power, seducer of women and exploiter of men; monstrous, monstrous Mr. Gurdjieff. These are all snapshots. The fact that they are not arranged in the order in which they were taken makes no difference. They represent roles through which, occasionally, the man beneath the role was glimpsed. All the photographs were taken in a certain context, for a particular purpose, directed at definite people. So the theory goes; and how far it is valid will be for the reader to say. But it would be unfair to tell the story of a man who believed that covering his tracks was an integral part of his work, without trying to show how the very act of making him historical denies what he set out to achieve. Unless the inquirer is aware of the concept of \"playing a role,\" he risks misinterpreting the story of Gurdjieff and his followers altogether. For--except in an unusual and specialized context-it is virtually impossible to assess the motives of any particular person at any particular time. The sense of events will be completely distorted if judged by ordinary standards. Wnat was really happening, for example, when Gurdjieff invited a sweet young thing to his Paris flat at midnight? Perhaps it was to gratify his natural appetites-and why not? Perhaps it was to shock a starry-eyed girl out of her illusions. Perhaps it was simply to see what answer he would receive; there were certainly cases when a girl actually slept in Gurdji eff's flat, after being invited to stay the night, and was completely unmolested. And what was her reaction to being left to sleep alone? Gurdjieff himself described his apprenticeship in the discipline of role playing in a passage quoted by his follower C. S. Nott from an unpublished work called \"A Letter to a Dervish\": The sign of a perfected man and his particularity in ordinary life must be that in regard to everything happening outside him, he is able to, and can in every action, perform to perfection externally the part corresponding to the given situation; but at the same time never blend"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE or agree with it. In my youth, I too . . . worked on myself for the purpose of attaining such a blessing . . . and . . . I finally reached a state when nothing from outside could really touch me internally; and so far as acting was concerned, I brought myself to such perfection as was never dreamed of by the learned people of ancient Babylon for the actors on the stage. The theory of role playing holds that the technique is an aid to detachment. Outwardly one plays the role in which one is cast, inwardly one becomes free from this role: the object is to detach the sensation of \"I\" from the experiences and reactions of the organism, while at the same time extending one's range by adopting unfamiliar parts. \"'I' am not 'it'\" is the motto which the role player must always remember-he must, as Gurdjieff said, \" self - remember\" -e ven when unjustly accused by a ferocious Gurd­ jieff who snapped at, cursed, and generally hauled one over the coals. In his book Meetings with Remarkable Men, Gurdjieff illustrates this principle with the fable of \"Yelov\" and \"Pogossian. \" The two men are extremely close, but conceal their afrection under assumed roles. If Yelov is offered a delicacy in a house where politeness demands that he accept it, he resists the pressure to conform; and although he is very fond of the sweet offered to him, he takes it home for his friend Pogossian. But he actually gives the tidbit to his friend with a volley of insults-and Pogossian takes the gift, no doubt aware of the difficulties Yelov had suffered in resisting both convention and his own sweet tooth, and devours the offering while insulting his benefactor in turn. When writers talk about Gurdji'eff, the man, they show only a series of disconnected snapshots; when they talk about his ideas, their books degenerate into a series of logoi, or sayings of Gurdji eff. To avoid distortion the snapshots are mounted in albums and their captions are the briefest possible. For, to string the pictures together would be to commit the sin of making history-and history, in Ouspensky 's favorite phrase, is \"the history of crime.\" History attends only to unimportant things, and the process of historical selection is arbitrary and misleading. However, some men can avoid the history of crime; and because they are superior to the ordinary run of humanity, they vanish from its ken. They have escaped from the trap, and so far as history is concerned become invisible. Margaret Anderson, the founder of The Little Review, has published an entire book called The Unknowable Gurd jieff , partly with the object of proving how a book can never be written about the Master. The American novelist Jean Toomer recorded his uncertainties in some manuscript notes made after more than fifteen years of contact with Gurdjieff. \"I do not know G.,\" he wrote. \"I have never known G. 1 never will.\" Gurdj ieff's invisibility"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 was most complete for those who knew him personally, and the historical observer has a direct advantage over his immediate associates. But for the historian too, Gurdjieff's doctrine of role playing produces a peculiar result. If there is a hidden meaning in every ordinary-seeming event, the story itself soon appears to have a significance independent of its component incidents. The Work assumes the aspect of a living organism, and the various external events which form its history appear to be deliberately created for the benefit of the chronicler. The pattern of discipleship and schism, loyalties and hatreds, takes on the appearance of having been arranged: the actors seem to weave a web of collusion even when they are apparently at daggers drawn. It is a vast symbol: a glyph etched in history. The glyph is composed not of pen strokes on paper or chisel marks in stone, but of the lives of men and women and their interaction. The long upstroke here indicates Gurdji eff's quest in Central Asia; that convergence of two lines-the last conversation of Orage and Katherine Mansfield; the cross-hatching there stands for countless hirsute Peters and Magdalenes pursuing the reality of that fo ns et origo of the magic influences: Gurdjieff. It is as if the biographer becomes a scribe occupying a small cell somewhere in the library of Alexandria. It is several hundred years after the birth of Christ, and before him the scribe has set out the interpretation of Christ's teaching made by Origen. This, too, finds a covert meaning in events, records echoes from the harmonies of the universe. The scribe krtaws the dangers seen in this interpretation by members of Origen's own religion, and he is a skeptical scribe, trained in the schools of Greek rationalism, aware that around him in this city of Alexandria-in this library in particular-there are learned men discussing Buddhism, the Cabala, and texts attributed to Thrice-Great Hermes. This accumulated pressure surrounds the scribe in the corridors of the library, the streets of the great city, and the lecture rooms of the philosophers. He resists it. It is there to be resisted. Yet, the legend which the wretched Origen has suggested to him is an obsessively interesting one, and he returns to his room to study the codices. He must concede that the aspiration shown by the prophet and his followers is extraordinary. Their goals are, to say the least, uncommon in any century. They want to awaken poor dozing Everyman from his stupor, blow a trumpet in his ear and persuade him to share their struggles, with a view to acquiring a permanent identity which he does not in fact possess, to maintaining perfect control over his largely automatic actions, and by a series of difficult exercises-physical, emotional, and intellectual-to in­ herit eternal life."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"PART I saw the Man. 1 \"And I beheld the Man.. \" His figure reached from earth to heaven and was clad in a purple mantle.

He was born; we can insist on that, and it is even fairly certain that he was born in the town of Alexandropol (now Leninakan) on the frontier between Russia and Turkey. But the precise birth date and even Gurdjieff s real name remain debatable, and they are only the first of the difficulties which confront the biographer. Evidence about the career of Gurdjieff is at all stages subject to special qualifications which the story alone can make clear. The man himself delighted in giving countenance to the most absurd tales about his past. This complicates in a peculiar fashion any attempt to reconstruct the story of his life until he appeared in Moscow about the year 1913. Georgei Ivanovitch Gurdjieff is said to have been born either in 1872 or 1877. Both dates have their supporters, although some writers suggest that he was born in 1886, and the American journalist William Seabrook favored the year 1873. Gurdjieff himself was fond of claiming a life of Methuselahan proportions. Once on a trip to the United States it was discovered that there had been confusion over the details on his passport. Consternation reigned among immigration officials and Gurdjieff' s aides. The passport gave his date of birth as sometime in the far distant future. \"No mistake,\" said the vetet:an of every conceivable traveling difficulty. \"No mistake-you go arrange. \" And somehow things were disentangled. The biographer himself 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCL E must \"go arrange, \" and opt for the year 1874, for reasons which will become clear in the next chapter. The day which Gurdjieff himself celebrated as his birthday and which his followers still honor in his memory is January 13. By the Old Style calendar used in Russia until the Revolution, this represents New Year's Day; and as Gurdjieff declared that he had been born precisely at midnight, this may be taken as a purely symbolic birthday. Yet to state bluntly that this extraordinary man was not born at midnight, on January 1 Old Style, may well be an unjustified reaction from those who accept the date and derive from it some supernatural significance. People are born at midnight: it is even a likely hour for a child to arrive in the world. The double coincidence of hour and date would not be the strangest thing about Georgei Ivanovitch Gurdj ieff. There is also a problem with his name. Gurdjieff was the son of a Greek father and an Armenian mother. Although he spoke both Greek and Armenian, the latter was the language of the Gurdjieff household. Gurdjieff is the Russian form of the name which in Armenian society would be rendered Gurdjian. Such an alteration was the rule for Asiatic Russians who had dealings with European Russia. William Seabrook states bluntly that Gurdjieff was born \"George S. Georgiades,\" and it is probable that \"Georgiades\" was the original Greek name of Gurdjieffs father, who altered it to \"Gurdjian\" when he found himself moving in circles in which Armenian was the lingua franca. The country where Gurdjieff grew up was an almost unbelievable patchwork of races and religions. In classical times over seventy languages were spoken in Caucasia, and fifty are still in use. In Gurdjieff 's childhood, Georgians, Armenians, and Azerbaijans rubbed shoulders with Greeks, Turks, and Persians; further north the high mountains of the Caucasus concealed pockets of puzzling tribes like the Khevsurs and Ossets who had no known genetic affiliations. There were the Russian masters of the area, Kurds wandering up from the south, Tartars, Cossacks from the north, and in the extreme northeast, Kalmuck Mongols in the provinces of Astrakhan and Stavropol on the coast of the Caspian Sea. The circumstances of Gurdjieffs birth, writes the French critic Manuel Rainord, \"make one believe in a sort of geographical vocatio n.\" The southern Caucasus was a frontier area in perpetual dispute between Turkey, Russia, and Persia. War and rapine had resulted in frequent migrations of peoples between the aggressor nations. The smaller races­ Armenians and Kurds particularly -were always in danger of persecution from one or another of their enemies. The Caucasus range itself had traditionally formed a refuge for the disinherited; and the security of its inaccessible valleys was a further reason why the lands between the Black"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE SEE K E R FOR T RUT H 27 Sea and the Caspian Sea gave the appearance almost of an experiment in the confusion of humankind. Gurdjieff clearly derived immense pleasure and stimulation from the diversity of people he encountered i n his childhood. The gusto of some of the tales in Meetings with Remarkable Men and the stage directions for his \"ballet\" The Struggle of the Magicians bear witness to his delight in the variety-yet sameness in that variety-of human beings. Gurdjieff's family were themselves a product of this cosmopolitan situation. His father came from a family of Greeks from Asia Minor which had been slowly migrating eastward ever since the Turkish capture of Byzantium. According to Gurdjieff, they had first settled in central Turkey, then moved north to the east coast of the Black Sea, and next to Georgia. Shortly before the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, Gurdj ieff's father left his brothers in Georgia and moved to the' Armenian town of Alexandropol, where Gurdjieff was born. After this move, he suffered a financial disaster; and from being a rich grazier, he was forced to turn to manual labor to support his family. His efforts as a carpenter met with little success and his prospects appeared better in Kars, a frontier town which the Russians had taken from the Turks in 1877. The Gurdjieff family moved yet again. It was in Kars that Georgei Ivanovitch Gurdjieff grew up. The family remained very poor, and there were three sisters and Gurdjieff 's brother Dmitri to be fed. The severity of their living conditions is shown by a story Dmitri Gurdjieff used to tell of a time when the two boys were rivals in love. It was not that they were rivals for the same girl, but if they both wanted to go out on the same evening, there was only a single pair of shoes between them. Gurdjieff's experience of extreme poverty undoubtedly affected him throughout his life and made him impatient with dreamers, dropouts, and those who wanted to discard their worldly obligations. \"Very important have piece of paper in life,\" he would say, advising a young man to go away and pass his exams; or, \"I also am business-m an.\" Apart from a few stray rumors, our only sources for Gurdjieff' s early life are his own writings, which present great problems when they are treated as biographical material. Certain epis � des are illuminated by the privately published manuscripts known as the Third Series . Gurdjieff 's pamphlet, Herald of Coming Good (1933), gives a rather confusing outline of his development up to the time when he appeared in Russia. The gargantuan Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson (1949) can be combed for biographical details; but because of the deliberately obscure method of narration and the quite unbelievable. fantasies put in the mouth of Gurdj ieff's benevolent and wise old Beelzebub, it is dangerous to take any statement as illustrating a real event. It is obvious, however, that there are autobiographical passages in Beelzebub's Tales, and its huge, irritating, and delightful bulk prOVides"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE many more general indications of where Gurdjieff tFaveled and what he saw. The chief source for the events of Gurdjieff's early life is the so-called autobiography, Meetings with Remarkable Men (1963). Meetings with Remarkable Men is Gurdjieff's account of his education and his wanderings, first in his native Caucasus, and later in Central Asia with a band of explorers he calls \"the Seekers for Truth.\" The book was partly designed, he warned, to satisfy the merely inquisitive by providing answers to the recurring questions which most frequently made inroads on his time. In addition, it was meant to serve as material to prepare for an understanding of his system. He claimed that it was also designed to give a picture of his own life; but in what style this was painted he did not say. And although the prose is clear, racy, and uncluttered by the Oriental complexities of Beelzebub's Tales to his Grands on, the book is similarly laden with symbols and allegorical stories. The narrative is in the time-honored form used by Marcus Aurelius. \"From so-and-so I learned such-and-such, from such-a-one I learned something else. \" Gurdjieff arranges his material in chapters which are known by the names of the \"remar k able men\" they portray; but beside the important personages are other characters, the subjects of tales-within-tales or the mouthpieces of sermons designed to illustrate particular points. The reader hears of Gurdjieff's boyhood friend, \"Sarkis Pogossian,\" whose mechanical abilities eventually won him a trading ship in the South Seas, ot \"Abraham Yelov,\" the Assyrian bookdealer of Tiflis, who accompanied Gurdjieff in philosophical inquiries and eventually emigrated from Soviet Russia to the United States. Lesser characters are \"Mme. Vitvitskaya,\" whose interests in music and vibration enable Gurdjieff to suggest the unusual way of considering sound which was so i m po rtan t to his system, and \"Father Giovanni,\" an Italian missionary whom the narrator meets in Kafiristan and who serves as his sponsor to the \"World Brotherhood\" and its remarkable monastery. Most of these characters probably had no historical existence. There may never have been a Yelov or a Mme. Vitvitskaya. But throughout the brightly colored adventure story and through the fumes of armagnac which Gurdjieff proclaimed he had drunk in heroic quantities while writing the book, comes an undeniable sense of authenticity. The characters may be imaginary or composites, but a rich supply of autobiographical experience from Gurdji eff's undoubtedly adventurous past went into their making. The reader soon becomes able to distinguish the different styles employed by Gurdjieff for the most obvious levels of Meetings with Remarkable Men. The account of his life and of his \"remarkable\" acquain ­ tances is written in a straightforward fashion. Into the mouths of the characters are inserted more oratorical declamations, rather in the manner"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE SEEKER FOR TRUTH 29 of Beelzebub, which should be taken like the pronouncements of that oracular personage. There are passages of deliberately \"literary\" composi­ tions such as the melodramatic introduction to Mme. Vitvitskaya as a victim of the white slave trade; and sharp doses of the deliberately absurd to keep the critical faculties alert. Also there are short fables or parables, which lend themselves to interpretation-and like all parables, to endless dispute about the meaning intended. It is dangerous to label any particular passage in the book as allegorical, for what seems obvious allegory often has a basis in fact. An example of this can be found in the chapter called \"Prince Yuri Lubovedsk y,\" in which the members of the Seekers for Truth call a conference in the Gobi Desert to discuss the best method of crossing the sand with the resources at their disposal. A plan of what seems transparent symbolism is unfolded. It is discovered that because the sand is of \"purely vegetable origin, \" the sheep belonging to the expedition can be kept going for longer by mixing a certain proportion of sand with their food. The difficulty of extending their food supply is thus overcome. But what about the sandstorms so common in the desert? One of the Seekers for Truth discovers that with a ladder he can see over the sandstorms and suggests that the party equip themselves with stilts. A final expert ties the whole plan together. By fastening their stilts between the sheep, they can form panniers to carry baggage and even themselves, thus conserving their energy. \"We were all so astounded, \" writes Gurdjieff, \"that all of a sudden it seemed to us that the difficulties of crossing the Gobi had been intentionally exaggerated, and even the impossibility of it suggested expressly for the trave ller.\" Of course, the obvious allegory is probably the point of the episode. It demonstrates certain principles of the Gurdjieff Method. There must be sheep in his work, because the travelers need fo od. They also need to see above appearances. The poor sheep-who are only sheep anyway and can never transcend the obvious like the stilt walkers-can carry the stilts, and the men as well, who can use the time to \"learn all the languages we shall need in future expeditions.\" If you like, it is an allegory about the uses to which sheep can be put by an intending goat. Why set it in the Gobi Desert, except to play mystery man? But what is really astonishing is the essential realism of the allegory, which is apparent only if the inquirer has experienced sandstorms which do in fact often stop at a short height above the ground. Stilts would be a theoretical although impractical way of seeing over the top. But sheep as baggage animals? That is surely carrying implausibility too far. Not according to Captain H.H. P. Deasy whose In Tibet and Chinese Turkestan was published in 1901. \"The best beasts of burden for Tibet, \" he writes, \"are undoubtedly the sheep of the country or of Ladak. If in good condition at starting, and in charge of a man who knows"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE his business, they will carry loads of about 22 Ibs. fOT a long time. . . .\" Carrying a man is an obvious impossibility, but by this time the inquirer is wondering about that sand . . . could it in fact be composed of vegetable matter? He would be wise to wonder no further. Gurdji eff 's statements are neither one thing nor the other-indeed, that is precisely what they are: neither-one-thing-nor-the-other-and confusion alone can result from fol­ lowing a too literal or a too skeptical approach. On one occasion Gurdjieff was embarked on some traveler's tale of Egypt when his follower P. D. Ouspensky confronted him with a man who was able to denounce his \"recollections\" as bogus. On the other hand, his knowledge of Central Asia frequently proves extensive. Underneath the conceptual juggl ing one thing is clear: It is generally more likely than not that Gurdjieff had been where he said he had been, although no one can ever be certain exactly where his inventiveness runs away with the facts. Within this all but overwhelming jungle of allegory and symbolism lies the central meta phor of Meetings with Remarkable Men: the metaphor of the persons of the book. For from whatever materials Gurdjieff constructed his characters--people like his father or \"Lubovedsky\" whom he had actually met, personifications of one aspect of his work like \"Vitvitskaya,\" composites of several influences which had in truth operated in his life, or spokesmen for various schools of thought he. had met in the East-their place in the structure of the tale is determined by their effect on the Gurdjieff who is telling the story, the \"Gurdjieff \" whom the author wished to present to his readers. The characters are introduced in some sense as his teachers, and perhaps certain of them actually were. But the most instructive \\\\'''ay of reading Meetings with Remarkable Men from a historical point of view is to treat each character as if he were an aspect of Gurdjieff himself. Gurdjieff taught that every man is composed of countless little \"1' s,\" hundreds of small and demanding egos whose competing claims deny man any individuality. On the one hand the characters represent the various 'T s\" of Gurdjieff which directed his pilgrim's progress. On the other hand they are expository, and symbolic. In Rainord's interpretation, \"'My Father' is, if you like, the goal of existence, 'Father Borah' the destiny of the male and female together, 'Bogachovsky' objective morality, 'Pogossian' the necessity of work, 'Abraham Yelov' the operation of thought, 'Prince Yuri Lubovedsky,' the summons to leave our darkness.\" The lessons they teach and the indications they offer as to where Gurdjieff drew his material are the things of most value. Gurdjieff begins by acknowledging the debt he owed to his father. Ivan Gurdjieff was a traditional poet and storytdler of the type his son calls"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE SEEKER FOR TRUTH 31 ashokh, who was in demand at the competitions where the peoples of the Caucasus met to judge the quality of their bards. As an ashokh he was the repository of much traditional lore. Gurdjieff rememb ers how one night he heard his father repeat one verse of the legend of Gilgamesh so often that its words were imprinted on his memory. Then just before the First World War, Gurdjieff relates, he read in a magazine about the discovery in the ruins of Babylon of ancient tablets engraved with the story of Gilgamesh. The particular stanza which his father had repeated was printed in almost the same form as Gurdjieff remembered it. As a boy he was thus under the influence-all the more powerful for being unperceived --of traditions which had survived virtually unchanged for millennia. Gurdjieff 's father had a friend in \"Dean Borsh\" of the Kars Military Cathedral. According to Meetings with RerruJrkable Men, it was the Dean who superintended the young Gurd jieff 's educ ation. The boy was at first sent to the Greek school in Kars, and then to the Russian municipal school. He attracted the attention of the Dean because he sang in the Cathedral choir-and a fine voice as a child may have inspired his lifelong interest in music. On Dean Borsh's advice, Gurdjieff was taken away from the municipal school and educated at home by a series of tutors. It was decided that he was to be both a priest and a physician. \"I myself, however, was drawn towards quite another way of life,\" records Gurdjieff. \"Having from my early childhood an inclination for making all sorts of things, I dreamed of technical specializatio n.\" lit other words he became a convinced Westernizer, and developed the interest in mechanical gadgets which lasted all his life. In Gurdji eff 's childhood, the wonders of Western science were just beginning to penetrate the Caucasus. By 1870 the main towns were linked by telegraph and two years later, the railway was completed between Poti on the Black Sea and Tiflis, the capital of Trans caucasia. The railway was an impo rtant factor in Gurdji eff 's youth. In Meetings with RerruJrkable Men he tells of how he once worked as a stoker in the Tiflis station yard, and in Beelzebub's Tales there is the story of the \"extremely sympa thetic Karapet of Tiflis\" who had the task of blowing the steam whistle which woke the Tiflis railway workers and also most of the town. Gurdjieff also claims to have acted as assistant to the engineer surveying the proposed railway route between Tiflis and Kars: apparently a most profitable venture. He writes-in his most gleeful impersonation of the Levantine shark-that he extracted a great deal of money from villages along the route by promising to have the railway track laid nearb y. His fascination with mechaJ)ics continued to provide Gurdjieff with a source of income. In his essay, \"The Material Questi on,\" he describes how for a bet he started a \"Universal Travelling Workshop\" which \"makes, alters"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE and repairs everything\" in the country between the Caspian and the Aral Sea. The traveling workshop probably has an allegorical significance, but the description of the extraordinary objects which were handed in for repair shows the relish of Gurdjieff the handyman: \"an apparatus for plucking out grey hairs, a machine for stoning cherries for jam, a grinder for grinding copper sulphate to sprinkle on the swea t zones of the body, a special iron for ironing wigs .... \" Yet it seems that, despite his unconcealed joy in his first automobile, and the perpetual enchantment which small gadgets gave him, Gurdjieff's early Western izing ideas later became a source of regret. His scathing comme nts on the aping of European civilization by the people of the Transcaspian region would hardly reflect that his brother opened the first cinema in Tiflis or that Ouspensky's first view of his leader in his native Caucasus was of Gurdjieff setting up a dynamo for his brother. ''These newly-rich people,\" he writes, \"according to the inherency of all upstarts, imitated everything 'cultured' and 'fashionable' -in the given case every­ thing European. But, drawing all their information about this culture and fashion only from Russian papers and magazines compiled by persons themselves ignorant in these matters, they presented to the impartial observer a comical and at the same time sad caricatur e.\" In later life Gurdjieff denounced European civilization in the strongest terms as causing the destru ction of religious feeling and partriarchal society. But he never renounced the machine. \"Man is a machine\" was the beginning of his teaching, and although he may have chosen mechanical analogies only for facility in introducing his ideas to the mechanized West, he used the framework of Victorian science with a certain conviction. Beelzebub tells his grandson: \"Objective Science says that 'ever ything without except ion in the Universe is materia l.'\" When the Universal Traveling Workshop became the Institute for the Harmonious Develop­ ment of Man, its director would tell his pupils: \"You are spoiled automobiles. You must be repai red.\" The tension between East and West which was felt by so many peoples as the colonial powers reached the limits of their expansion was experienced by Gurdjieff as an existen tial probl e m. Unusual circumstances of birth and upbringing enabled him to sense the dilemma in an unusual fashion. His solution was bound to be extraordinary. In Meetings with Remarkable Men, he describes how his eyes were gradua lly opened to the existence of happenings for which the impressive knowledge of the West had no explanation. He was bewildered by a seance during which the \"spirits\" rapped out messages, and further amazed when a wandering ashokh made predictions about him which were fulfilled. Then he witnessed the spectacle of a boy imprisoned by a circle drawn on the ground. The boy was a Yezidje-a member of a heterodox religious sect"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE SEEK ER FOR TRUTH 33 inhabiting the Caucas us-and apparently he was powerless to leave the circle unless released by a Yezidje priest. From what Ouspensky says, the Yezidjes did exercise a fascination over Gurdj ieff, who claimed to have experimented on the phenomenon of the imprisoning circle during his later investigations into hypnotism ;* and it is possible that in all his tales of the supernatural, only the incident of the Yezidje boy has any basis in fact. What we are to understand is that, despite the captivating effect of Western science, Gurdjieff found himself demanding explanations which the edu­ cated men around him could not supply. The boy Gurdjieff b ecame disillusioned with the accepted partial versions of the truth and, conceiving that truth existed, set out to find it. The result was \"what modern psychologists might term an 'irresistible Mania'''; This mania began to impose itself upon my being at the time of my youth when I was on the point of attaining responsible age and consisted in what I would now term an \"irrepressib le striving\" to understand clearly the precise significance in general, of the life process on earth of all the outward forms of breathing creatures, and, in particular, of the aim of human life in the light of this interpretation. What does it all mean? What is humanity? Is there a purpose to life? Who am I? Such questions occur to most people at certain times in their lives, usually to be shrugged off as irrelevant to the business of living. But there are always some individuals for whom life seems impossible without a clear understanding of its significance; for whom meaning is the fuel without which life itself flickers out. Somet imes-most often in late adolescence or at a time of personal crisis-the lack of a definite rationale can induce an anguished condition which impels the sufferer to seek explanations. The search for meaning may event ually lead a person to a teacher of the sort which Gurdjieff later became, and as an adolescent Gurdjie ff too was at the mercy of the sort of anxiety which drove those who became his pupils. In fact, he seems to have experienced the meaninglessness of life with a pecu liar intensity, and his \"irresistible mania\" led him to dash hither and thither, from one supposed authority to the next. His search turned from the pundits of materialist science to the recognized expert s on spiritual matters; Having become extremely interested in supernatural phenomena I had plunged into books and also applied to men of science for *This phenomenon is not unknown ia occult literature. The Irish poet and mystic A. E. (George Russell) was immobilized in a similar way by his guru, the American Theosophist James Morgan Pryse."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE explanations of these phenomena. But failing to:' find answers that satisfied me . . . I began to seek them in religion. I visited various monasteries and went to see men about whose piety I had heard, read the Holy Scriptures and the Lives of the Saints, and was even for three months an acolyte of the famous Father Yevlampios in the monastery of Sanaine; and I also made pilgrimages to most of the holy places of the many different faiths in Transcaucasia. The racial mixture of the Caucasus resulted in the jumbling together of every conceivable form of religion. There were the relatively established churches of Oriental Christianity: Greek, Russian, and Armenian. There were Nestorian and Assyrian Christians, the Manichean Yezidjes, and eclectic peoples like the Ossets, who were part Christian, part Moham­ medan, part pagan. Even in the north of the Caucasus, around Vladikavkaz, Mohammedans could be found; and to the northeast, the Buddhist Kalmucks wandered on the steppes of Stavropol and Astrakhan. Countless sects from the bewildering variety of Russian dissenters inhabited secluded valleys. There were colonies of Doukhobors, Molokans, and European Protestants. In the south could be found all the different shades of Islam. According to one missionary, writing in 1896, some of the nominally Christian tribes of the mountains were \"really polytheists, and worship, besides what they call the Christ-God, a god of war, and gods or 'angels' of the earth, the oak, the mountain and so forth.\" Even the Christian churches with which Gurdjieff came in contact were the result of an agelong mingling of doctrines, and derived ultimately from traditions quite different from those which formed Western Christianity. Heresy and dissent flourished in secret. For example, after the Russo­ Turkish War of 1828-29, a number of Turkish Armenians fled to the territories which Russia had recently conquered. In 1837 their bishop warned the Synod of the Orthodox Armenian Church in Echmiadzin that some of these families were really Paulicians, and a great scandal developed. The migration of peoples sometimes considerably altered their religious practices. As late as 1920 Sir Harry Luke, the British Commis­ sioner in Tiflis, recorded in his diary that he had received a deputation of Greeks who had emigrated eastward like GurdjietF's ancestors. \"They were accompanied by their papas, \" wrote Luke, \"who told me that he celebrated the liturgy in Greek but preached (when he had occasion to do so ) in Georgian.\" It is possible to analyze Gurdjieff's teaching and to point to features which might have come from the various religious traditions of the Caucasus. Some indications of his sources will be given at the end of this book. All that is important at this stage is that he had access to Greek,"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE SEEK ER FOR TRUTH 35 Russian, and Armenian churches by the simple facts of his birth and upbringing. \"Father Yevlampios\" has disappeared in the mists of time, but the monastery of Sanaine or Sanahin is a celebrated foundation dating from the tenth century and situated just south of Tiflis. If the idea of Gurdji eff's educators was to bring him up as a priest and a physician, it may be wondered how far along the path of the seminarian he traveled. He told his groups in Russia that his teaching might be called \"esoteric Christiani ty,\" and several of the characters in the early pages of Meetings with Remarkable Men are priests or novices. Gurdji eff 's admission that he had been acolyte to Father Yevlampios permits speculation that he proceeded some way along the road to the priesthood before becoming disillusioned. In his account of the Gurdjieff family home in 1917, Ouspensky mentions a photograph which was kept in the house. It showed Gurdjieff \"when he was quite young, dressed in a black frock coat with his curly hair brushed straight back. \" This \"determined with undoubted accuracy ,\" Ouspensky writes, \"what his profession was at the time the portrait was made-though Gurdjieff never spoke of it. This discovery gave me many interesting ideas. But since it was my own personal discovery I shall keep it to mysel f.\" There are few occupations which are readily indentifiable from a photograph, and Ouspensky later told his pupils that in this portrait Gurdjieff was wearing \"a high hat.\" Just possibly this might mean the white conical hat worn by the Mevlevi dervishes, but probably it refers to the familiar black headgea r of the Orthodox priesthood. If Gurdjieff had been a \"spoiled\" priest this would explain his dislike of the religious professionals who in his view had usurped the name of priest. But the evidence is not conclusive, and all that can safely be said is that Gurdjieff made a thorough investigation of the exotic territory of Trans­ caucasian religion. He tells of miraculous cures brought about by icons; of a service to honor a particularly venerated icon which caused rain to fall in the middle of a drought; of his own pilgrimage to the Armenian holy city, Echmiadzin, southeast of Kars and Alexa ndropol, when he took his baggage \"in the wagon of the Molokan sect.\" \"But in my stay at Echmiadz in,\" he writes, \"I did not find what I was looking for and, having spent enough time to realize that I could not find it there, I went away with a feeling of deep inner disillusion ment.\" This is Gurdji eff 's general comment on the relationship between the organized religions of his youth and the knowl­ edge of which he was in search. His questioning mind turned in other directions. Gurdjieff was by no means the only seeker for hidden truth caught in the friction between old and new ... Throughou t all Western Europe, the last quarter of the nineteenth century witnessed an increasingly frantic search for security. This resulted in the creation of a number of new religions and a"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE burgeoning interest in the supernatural, magic, and the occult. Partly as a reaction against the menacing changes in society and the destruction of treasured beliefs, partly also as a protest against the extensi ve claims of materialist science, the occult revival was a powerful intellectual force. It penetrated Russia, where the half-Oriental religious conventions of Orthodoxy easily absorbed it, and the gloriously diverse ideas of the Orthodox priesthood found in the occult more grist to their mill. At the same time, the conditions of disatisfaction and anxiety which attracted Western Europeans to mysticism and magic, turned Russians to their own luxuriant spirituality. From the point of view of Gurdjieff 's search two occult groups are important. The first is the Theosophical Society, which was founded in New York in 1875 by the redoubtable Russian Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and the American Colonel H. S. Olcott. The Theosophi­ cal Society transferred its base to Adyar, near Madras in India, and became extraordinarily . influential among the seekers for truth of Europe and America. Although H. P. Blavatsky's books and her Society were banned in Russia, small groups of Theosophists continued to meet. They were supplied with literature by travelers abroad; and the earliest and most dedicated of these Theosophical colporteurs was a Mme. Nina de Gernet, one of whose ports of call was a circle of Theosophists in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the central Caucasus. It is certain that Gurd jieff had read Theosophical literature. He afterward said that it had cost him an immense amount of labor to track down the erroneous statements in Mme. Blavatsky's The Secret Doctr ine, and delighted to tell a completely mythical story of how its author had fallen in love with him. It is not unlikely that Gurdjieff, realising he would not find the answers he sought in orthodox religion, came across Theosophical works which had traveled to Russia through Vladikavka z. Another mystical group which may have had some connection with Gurdjieff originated in Tiflis itself. This was centered around Pavel Alexandrovitch Florensky (b. 1882), an eccentric genius whose mother. like Gurdjieff 's, was Armenian. With his friends A. V. Elchaninov (b. 1881), V. F. Ern (b. 1881), and the chil d prodigy V. P. Sventitsky, Florensky moved to Moscow and entered the priesthood. This group absorbed the influences of the occult revival and incorporated what in the West would have been called occultism with Orthodox theology. They began to publish-most notably Florensky's The Pillar and Foundation of Truth (1914) and Sventitsky's book on the hermits of the Caucasus (1913)- about the time that Gurdjieff appeared in Moscow. The Florensky circle were all younger than Gurdjieff and it may be reading too much into the situation to see a direct connection in their Tiflis origins. But the ideas of contemporary occultism which influenced them were also current In Gurdjieff ' s milieu,"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE SEEK ER FOR TRUTH 37 and in Meetings with Remarkable Men, he indicates the increasingly occult tone of his search for meaning in the chapters on \"Captain Pogossian\" and \"Abram Yelov\"-both of whom the story places among his Tiflis friends. \"Abram Yelov\" is introdu ced as a polyglot Assyrian bookdealer. Books must have become increasingly important to Gurdjieff in the pursuit of his \"irresistible mania\": whether books on religious questions, books on the supernatural-in Beelzebub's Tales he mentions one called Dreams and Witchcr aft which \"Karapet of Tiflis\" acquired -or books on hypnotism, a subject with whose literature he claimed a speciali st's familiarity. Science and the more easily accessible forms of religion had failed him; but here was the enormous and daily increasing library of occult texts, whose authors all dropped tantalizing hints that they possessed the explanation of the universe which the priests and the scientists had failed to grasp . Gurdjieff succu mbed to the same influences as many of his less remarkable contem poraries and immersed himself in occult literature. His reading made him familiar with the occultists ' most cherished idea: that there had existed from time immemorial an esoteric Tradition of secret knowledge, transmitted from initiate to initiate down through the cen­ turies. Gurdjieff later gave the unwieldy name of \"legominism\" to what he considered a true or valid item of Traditional wisdom, but from his incessant abuse of \"occultis ts,\" it is clear that he soon became disillusioned with those who claimed to be the contemporary guardians of esoteri c wisdom. In Beelzebub's Tales he calls them \"criminal gangs\" and refers to the \"great initiates\" they venerate as men who pass through \"fire-water­ copper-p ipes-and-even-through-all-the-roulett e-halls-of- Monte-C arlo.\" But disillusionment with the occult did not mean that Gurdjieff aban­ doned all hopes of finding a secretly proved explanation of the universe. He decided that if truth were accessible, the esoteric Tradition must have degenerated over the ages. In Meetings with Rema rkable Men, he claims that he and his friend \"Sarkis Pogossian\" decided to reconstruct what they could of its original form: Pogossian and I had come to the definite conclusion that there really was \"a certain something\" which people formerly knew, but that now this knowledge was quite forgotten. We had lost all hope of finding any guiding clue to this knowledge in contemporary exact science, in contemporary books or from people in general, and so we directed all our attention to ancient literatu re. The earliest writings of humanity might hold the key to knowledge which had existed before the rot set in. Other seekers for wisdom had made similar deductions, but Gurdjieff was uniquely placed to proceed from"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE theory to practice. If the knowledge he sought was not to be found in books which were readily available or even in the spiritual labYrinth of the Cauca sus, he would travel further afield in search of it. Meetings with Remarkable Men gives exam ples of this search . One episode begins when he and \"Pogossian\" settle down with a collection of rare books in the ruins of the ancient Armenian town of Ani, near Alexandrop ol. They vary their diet of study with amateur excavation in the ruins. Here they find a collection of old letters from one monk to another, in which a society known as the \"Sarmoun Brotherhood\" is mentioned. Gurd jieff and Posgossian have already stumbled on references to this society, \"a famous esoteric school which, according to tradit ion, was fo unded in Babylon as far back as 2500 B.C. \" They decide that traditio ns stemming from this school will be preserved among the Assyrian Chris­ tians, and set off on a journey in search of its surviving traditi on. On their way the pair stay at the house of an Armenian priest, who proves to have in his possession \"a map of pre-sand Egypt. \" This discovery so excites Gurdjieff that he burgles the priest's locked chest and copies the map. With this in his possession, he decides at once to embark on a journey to Egypt. The story reads like a boy's treasure-hunting adventure, and it gives only general indicati ons of what Gurd jieff wanted to convey. He sought fo r traces of Traditional knowledge in ancient literature, in inaccessible manuscripts, in recent archaeological discove ries. The association of secret wisdom with the Assyrian Christians whom Gurdjieff calls \"Aissors\" is probably to be taken more seriously. \"Abram Yelov\" was an \"Aisso r,\" and Gurdjieff mentions his contacts among members of this widely scattered group on more than one occasi on. There would have been logical reasons fo r Gurdjieff to look fo r knowledge among the Aissors, and these will be discussed in connection with his doctri ne. What he meant by his tale of the \"map of pre-sand Egypt\" is a matter for guesswork . Most probably it signifies some guide to the state of human consc iousness before it became pervert ed; but the expression might simply have been chosen to conform to the expectations of a mystery-loving audience . In Herald of Coming Good, Gurdjieff writes that despite all his searching, he was unable to throw light on the questions which interested him until the year 1892. In the prospectus issued to mark the opening of his Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man at Fontainebleau, . he places the foundation of the society of the See�ers for Truth in 1895. Between these dates it can be inferred that Gurdjieff s search took on a more ambitious aspect; and perhaps his tale of dashing off to Egypt with an esoteric map in his pocket indicates that he extended his travels beyond the relatively local expedition s he had previously made. That Gurdjieff sud­ denly vanished from his home and was lost to the sight of his family is"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE SEEK ER FOR TRUTH 39 confirmed by P. L. Travers: \"While he was still a very young man, Gurdjieff, true to his role, 'disappeare d'-as Odysseus must have seemed to disappear from his local world of Ithaca-i nto that cauldron of history, tradition and ideas that we know as the Middle East. \" Gurdjieff is usually thought to have first left home about the age of sixteen; but recent ly his follower J. G. Bennett published a story which suggests that his wanderings began even earlier. Gurdjieff told a Miss Anna Durco (whom he met as a child in 1934) that he had run away with the gypsies who passed through Kars each spring on their way to trade horses. At the age of eleven his friendships with the gypsy boys developed into a protracted period of truancy with a tribe of nomads from the Carpathians . As he later told the story, Gurdjieff made it seem that he was more intrigued by the legends of hidden wisdom attached to the gypsies than by their romantic way of life. It would be too much to expect a child of eleven to have any interest in philosophical matters; but there is nothing against believing that the young Gurdjieff was enthralled by the more romantic aspects of gypsy lore. His precocious appetite for adventure is confirmed by William Seabrook's impression that he \"rail away to sea at an early age.\" He was ridden by a particul arly merciless daemon. From childhQOd, he writes, he had \"an 'irresistible urge' to do things not as others do them.\" So \"if all the other children slid down the hill head first, I tried to do it, and moreover, each time better and better, as the children then called it, 'backside-f irst.'\" The deliberate contrariness of the child was reflected in the obstinacy of the youth and the matured philosophy of the man, whose entire ration ale ran cross-grained to his surroundings. To this natural mulishness was added a sense of urgency which must have had some basis in the facts of his early life. One story in Meetings with Remarkable Men suggests an explanation. He and his schoolfellow \"Peter Karpe nko\" fell in love with the same girl. They decided to spend a day on the local artillery range while firing was in progress, and let the gunners settle their differences for them . Both survived their harrowing experience to become fast friends. In early manhood Gurdjieff was no stranger to the chances of sudden death, and a number of narrow escapes may have been partly responsible for his later conviction that the only way of saving mankind would be to implant in each human being the consciousness of his own mortality. We know further that this young man once commiserated with a group of ladies from the literary world with the words: \"I too was once sick for art.\" In Europe and the United States he was surrounded by Bohemian s and \"artistic\" people; and he was reported in 1 919 to be on familiar terms with the Georgian poets and artists of the day. If he associated with any particular group of artists during his early life, we know nothing of it,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE although his chosen art would beyond all doubt have been the theater. Yet, even if Gurd jieff were really \"sick\" for art, his sickness was subordinated to the demanding irritation of his \"itching-i tch,\" the pursuit of meaning. At some time or another he concluded that the knowledge he sought existed not only in the form of secrets handed down among \"genuine initiates ,\" but in works of art constructed according to a definite purpose by the ancient guardians of the esoteric Tradition. The feeling that the wonders of the ancient world meant something, were actually capable of revealing to man secrets known to their makers, was common among nineteenth-century occul tists influenced by Blavatsky; and Gurdjieff was not immune to this sort of speculation. But he went further, and his view of the role of art was more extensive. In Beelzebub's Tales he describes an imaginary club called \"The-A dherents-of-Legominism\" dedicated to passing on wisdom by artistic means. The members of this club are supposed to have decided that they should construct their works of art-be they paintings, statues, or dances ­ on the basis of the universal \"Law of Sevenfoldn ess,\" one of the laws on which Gurd jieff based his cosmology. Into works made according to this system of relation and proportion, the artists would introduce \"intentional inexac titudes\" or deliberate departures from the canon. These were intended to point the message which the work of \"objective art\" was designed to convey. Perhaps we are to imagine Gurd jieff inspecting the wonders of the world in the light of his own later teaching about art as a transmi tter of legominism. In this spirit he once described his discovery of a \"strange figure in the desert at the foot of the Hindu Kush-perhaps one of the famous Buddhas of Bamian. \"At first,\" he told Ouspensky, \"it produced upon us simply the impression of being a curiosity. But after a while we began to fe el that this figure contained many things, a big, complete and complex system of cosmology. And slowly, step by step, we began to decipher this system. It was in the body of the figure, in its legs, in its arms, in its head, in its eyes, in its ears: everywhere. In the whole statue there was nothing accidental, nothing without meaning. And gradua lly we understood the aim of the people who built this statue. We began to feel their thoughts, their feelings. Some of us thought that we saw their faces, heard their voices .... \" Where did Gurdjieff travel in his search for the knowledge which so obsessed him? Three times he made unheralded appearances in the centers of European civilization, and each time the tale was vague yet apparently circumstan tial. To Ouspen sky in M oscow he spoke of \"Tibetan monasteries, the Chitral, Mount Athos; Sufi schools in Persia, in Bokhara, and eastern Turkestan; he mention ed dervishes of various orders; but all of them in a very indefin ite way.\" C ecil Sharp, the editor of the London New Statesma n,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE SEEKER FOR TRUTH 41 located the area of Gurdji eff 's search in \"that little-known region which lies between Eastern Persia and Tibet .\" William Seabrook, who knew Gurdjieff in New York, wrote that he \"spent many years in Outer Mon golia and Tibet, where he is said to have been at one time a Tibetan monk, and to have absorbed the mystical practices and teachings of the Sufis, Yogis, Melewi, Rufiah, and Persian dervishes. I can testify of my own knowledge,\" concluded Seabrook, \"that Gurdjieff knows more about dervish mysticism and magic than any man I have ever met outside a dervish monaste ry.\" All the rumors concerning the source of his knowledge point to Central Asia; and of course, to its most inaccessible parts. Sometimes it seems that every mystical philosopher has claimed to have been in Tibet. The origin of the Tibetan obsession lies in Mme. Blavatsky's invention of the \"Tibetan Mahatmas\" who watched over the Theosophical Society. But in Gurdjieff 's case the legend is almost certainly based on fact. The stories of his travels almost always contain circu mstantial evidence --like the idea of using sheep as baggage animals-which supports their accuracy. His teaching certainly incor porated elemen ts from Tibetan Buddhism, and many of his earliest followers were convinced that he had been in Tibet. C. S. Nott even tells us that Gurdjieff had himself been made collector of revenues for the Dalai Lama; and other disciples remember that Gurdji eff 's establishment in France was sometimes visited by inscrutable guests from Central Asia. Gurdjieff first became known in the West as a \"teacher of dancing\"; and the names of the places where his dances are said to have originated provide further evidence that he had been where he claimed to have been. There are several helpful indications in the program of dances and movements which Gurdjieff presented at Christmas 1923 in Paris. On the one hand places are mentioned which are easily identifiable, like the city of Mazar-i-Sh arif in northern Afghanistan, or Yangi Hissar, a sizeable town south of Kashgar in Central Asia. Then there are more general references to Chinese Turkestan and Kafiristan which cann ot be checked. Lastly, there are names difficult to find on any map, but which provide the best evidence of all that Gurdjieff was in Central Asia. We learn of the \"monks of Matc hna,\" at the monastery of \"Kisil-Djan \" at the \"Oasis of Keril\" [ Chinese Turke stan]; the monastery of \"Souxari\" near \"Outchan-Su in Kashgaria,\" the medical temple of \"Sari\" in Tibet, and \"the Sanctuary of Houdankr, Lotko country in the Chitral .\" It may be possible to find these locations on unusua lly detailed maps, and it is certainly possible that Gurdjieff 's dances did not come from the sources he indicated-although, he also specifies other out-of-the-way places lik � Sessi Mada ne in Transcaucasia which do exist. But what is peculiarly interesting in the references to \"Kisil- Djan,\" \"Outchan- Su, \" \"Sari,\" and \"Houdankr, \" is that a l though they resist identification, in each case the etymology o f the name is consistent with the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE language of the area in which they are supposed to be. The conc1usion is inevitable either that Gurdjieff had been there , as he said, or that he was closely associated with men who had traveled in those regio ns. Gurd jieff told Ouspensky that his journeys in the East had been undertaken in the company of \"all sorts of specia lists .\" Some were workin g, he said, some had since died, others were \"in seclusion .\" After Ouspensky arrived in London in 1921, Cecil Sharp published in the New Statesman some further inf ormation on the Seekers fo r Truth which was probably derived from Ouspensky hims elf, or fr om pupils at Font ainebleau like Sharp's wif e . The movement originated some thirty years ago in an expedition organ ised by Mr. Gurdjieff - then very young -and two Russi an savan ts, with the ob ject of discovering what, if possible, lay behind the fa bled \"wisdom of the Eas t. \" Five years were spent in gath ering and tra ining a band of about thirty investiga tors, mostly Russians, who between them might claim to know all that Europe knew of science and art. They then set out . . . and . . . separa ted, each to seek entry into some \"school\" where esoteric knowledge might be fo und. . . . After several years a few of them returned and organ ised a second expedit ion. Some of the members of both expeditions are still in Central Asia and will probably never return . Others including Mr. Gur dj ieff, after spending the best part of twenty years in various Eastern school s, came back to Europe and are now engaged in working upon the masses of material that they brought with them, while maintaining communication with those who have remained behind. The prospectus fo r Gurd jieff's Institute at Fontaineblea u- which con­ tai ns a quantity of fal se, not to say frau dulent inf orma tion-talks of a company of \"doct ors, archa eologists , priests , pa inters, et c. , et c. , with the aim of mutual assis tance in research into so-called supernatural phenomena which interested each one from a particular point of vie w. \" Gurd jieff frequently told outrageous lies, even when it was clear that the listener had no thought of belieVing him: Thus, to an American doctor and pupil whom he knew to be fa miliar with his personal circutn stanc es, he announced blandly that in France he had \"two hundred pupil s-all docteurs .\" The picture of a sort of combined Society fo r Psychical Research and Royal Cent ral Asian Society is certainly exaggerat ed. But· on balance it is probable that Gurdjieff did have some collaborato rs in his quest, even if they were only travel ing com panions or chance acquaintances. There is an outside possibility that a regular group did fo rm fo r cer tain expedit ions; in Meeting .'; with Remarkable Men Gurd jieff mentions an"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE SEEKER FOR TRUTH 43 expedition of 1898 in the Gobi Desert and another of 1900 in the Pamirs . The \"savan ts\" to whom Sharp ref ers may have been the characters portra yed as \"Prin ce Lubovedsky\" and \"Prof essor Skridlov .\" In two diff erent places Gurd jieff talks of meeting two Russian savants beside the Pyra mids, and although such a meeting might represent only a continued \"quest fo r the inexplica bl e,\" the repetition of this incident may ind icate a real experience . On each occ asion one of the figures is said to have been \"S kridlov ,\" the Prof essor of Archa eology . In Beelzebub's Tales the other is unnamed; but in Meetings with Remarkable Men, the second Russian is named as \"Prince Lubovedsky ,\" \"my elder comrade and closest fri en d. \" There is a strong tradition that Gurd jieff's aristocratic patron was a real person, and Ouspensky thought that he had met the archa eologist. But it is saf est to regard the Seekers fo r Truth as a body in which Gurd jieff's friends would be included but which comprehends all those in pursuit of eternal things ; just as the World Brotherhood which the group is said to have contacte d, is composed of all those pract icing the right methods to spiritual atta inment: Among the adepts of this monastery there were fo rmer Christia ns, Jews , Mohammedans, Buddhists, Lam aists, and even one Shamanist. All were united by God the Truth . All the brethren of this monastery lived together in such amity that, in spite of the specific traits and properties of the representatives of the diff erent religi ons, Prof essor Skridlov and I could never tell to which religion this or that brother had fo rmerly belong ed. Where then did Gurdjieff tra vel? He mentions Turkey, Athos , Crete, Jerusalem, and Egypt, where he was a tourist guide at the Pyram ids. Accord ing to Meetings with Rema rkable Men he went as far south as Ethiopia, and at the end of his lif e he prof essed an undying aff ection fo r that part of the world . He claimed to have penetrated Mecca and Medina, but was disappointed in the holy places of Islam. He considered the center of \"real\" knowledge preserved in Islamic fo rm to be in Central Asia, near Bokhara, Merv, and Samarka nd, and above all, Meetings with Remarkable Men is filled with the gusto of the Cen tral Asian khanates approached up the River Oxus. The next chapter will show that Gurdjieff visited India, Tibet, and China; he claimed also to ha ve taken part in a journey through Siberia; and at a later period of his life he spent much time in Turkestan and the lands around Kashgar. It seems that he probably knew sufficient languages fo r his purpose . Greek, Arm enian, Tadjik, and Turkish he would have known fr om early . youth. He is supposed also to have spoken Arabic and Italian-the"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"44 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE common languages of the Mediterranean at the turn o£ the century-and he probably picked up some French and English. His claims to fluency in eighteen different languages should be taken with a pinch of salt, but these claims were probably more nearly true than false. What Gurdjieff brought back from his journeys will be considered separately. Apart from various Sufi orders and monasteries both Christian and Buddhist, he mentions that he was a member of a society of Persians which met at Baku to study magic, and also that he was at one time a practitioner of yoga. However, some of his energies may well have been absorbed by less esoteric studies. In the Middle East, the years of Gurdjieff ' s search were those of the most romantic period of archaeology. By 1890 archaeological exploration of Assyri a--Gurdji eff 's personal interest -had reached a peak. Gurd jieff speaks of a journey to Thebes with \"Professor Skridl ov\" which continued via the Red Sea to Babylon, where he left his friend \"to continue his excavations.\" The exciting discoveries of conte mporary archaeologists, among them Flinder Petrie, undoubtedly spurred on his search for the knowledge which he believed had been buried by the generations. In Central Asia the great age of Russian exploration had been inaugurated by N. M. Prjevalsky's expedition through Mongolia in 1870. In 1888, on his fifth journey, Prjevalsky died; but in the early 1890s his successor, P. K. Kozlov, mounted expeditions in Turkestan and in the later part of the 1890s in Mongolia and the middle Gobi. Non-Russian explorers like Sven Hedin and Aurel Stein entered the field, and Central Asia became the favorite area for adventurous scholars. When Gurdjieff talks of an expedit ion into the Gobi Desert to find a city rumored to be buried beneath the sands, he may well be dealing in symbols; but such rumors did draw archaeologists ta the Gobi, and reports of sand-buried cities came from Sven Hedin himself. The disinterring of ancient knowledge and the uncovering of the true nature of man are undoubtedly intended, but the symbolism is prompted by the conditions surrounding Gurdji eff's personal quest. Gurdjieff might have been able to satiSfy his interest in ancient civilizations and gain access to distant and inaccessible lands by joining scientific expeditions in Central Asia; and a gift for languages would have been highly prized. The idea helps to explain bQw a young man from a penniless family was able to make ends meet in unfamiliar country. If we discount the idea of financial backing from the Seekers for Truth, Gurdjieff's initial forays into Central Asia requir e-some plausible ground­ ing. A possibility which prOVides a more convincing explanation of his early mobility is that from an early age he was an agent of the Russian secret s ervice. This possibilit y has been responsi ble for certain portrayals of Gurd jieff as"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE SEEK ER FOR TRUTH 45 a Black Magician straight from the pages of Dennis Wheatley. Louis Pauwels, editor of the anthology Monsieur Curdjreff, mixes the occult and politics into an impossi ble conspiracy involving both Hitler and Stalin. Stalin and Gurdjieff, says Pauwels, \"were at school toget her,\" and J. G. Bennett claims to have heard Gurdjieff endorse this tale himself. It is certainly true that the young Joseph Dzhugashvi li-who became Joseph Stalin-was a lodger with the Gurdjieff family at some time during his career at TiHis Theological Seminary from 1894 to 1899; and that he left owing them a substantial sum of money. It has been said by Stalin's enemies that he acted at one time as an agent for the Tsarist authorities, and possibly some confused thinking led to the connection with Gurdjieff being distort ed. What is interesting is that the charges against Stalin originate in the well-known habit of the Tsarist Intellige nce Service of offering a suspect the choice of serving with them as an alternative to punishment. A story about Gurdjieff which used to circulate in London emigre circles was that he had been imprison�d for evading military service. The source was Prince Mikail Sumbatov, who in the early 1890s was Commissioner for Special Duties attached to the Governor of Kars; and it is totally in keeping with our knowledge of Gurdjieff that he should have tried to dodge the draft. There is not a shred of evidence to support the speculation, but it is tempting to wonder whether he was offered the sort of choice which the authorities held out to others. Even if this possi bility is discounte d, some sort of government backing best explains Gurdjieff 's confusing statement in Herald of Coming Good about the great advantages his \"peculiar condi­ tions\" of life gave him over the ordinary man. The pron ouncement otherwise reads like a symptom of paranoia, and it does not have the same ring as the deliberately boastful passage about its author's endowment with \"the highest degrees of comprehension attainable by man,\" which precedes it. I had, in accordan ce with the peculiar conditions of my life, the possibility of gaining access to the so-called \"holy-of-holies\" of nearly all hermet ic organisa tions such as religious, philosophical, occult, political and mystic societie s, congregations, parties, unions, etc. , which were inacce ssible to the ordinary man . . . There is only one sort of job which secures rapid entrance into all organizations, whether political, religious, or intellectual, and that is the task of the agent who can rely on the contacts built up by his organization to establish his good faith. In Meetings with Remarkable Men Gurdjieff describes how he and his friend \"Pogossi an\" had themselves appointed the agents of an \"Armenian"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Committee\" in order to finance their travels in search of knowledge . This Armenian Committee was presumably connected with the Armenian Social Revolutionary Party known as the Dashnakt sutiun, which was established in TifUs in 1890 and adopted a political program two years late r. Gurdjieff places his expedition with Pogossian in a year of militant Armenian nationa lism when the hero \"Andronik\" (alias Ozanian) first began to attract attention. Although it is impossible to identify the year exactly, if there is any his torical basis fo r this episode, it probably occurred in the early 1890s. It was not the last of Gurd jieff's ventures into politics. In the Third Series Gurd jieff relates that three times in his life he was seriously wounded by stray bullets. The first time was in Crete in the year 1896, \"the year bef ore the Graeco-Turkish war. \" It may have been the year before war actually broke out between the two nat ions, but it was the year of the Greek rebellion agai nst the Turks which provoked the war. Gurd jieff was evidently involved with the revolutionarie s, as he was transported out of the island by certain Greeks who were strangers to him and brought to Jerusalem to recover from his wound. We may ascribe Gurd jieff's involve ment in this political squabble solely to his Greek ancestry and the exhortat ions of \"true patriots\" of the sort he describes elsewhere in connection with the Cretan uprising; but this seems most unlikely . Russia had an interest in the war, as fo r vari ous reasons it opposed the union of Crete with Greece. While Gurd jieff may simply have been using political occas ions fo r his private ends, a care er associated with both Greek and Armenian nationalism simply invites speculation . Besides being the great age of archaeology and exploratio n, the last quarter of the nineteenth century was the high point of the expansion of Imperial Russia. The capture of Kars shortly before the Gurdjieff family moved there was the culmination of the Russian drive south; but the empire builders even had their eyes on Africa. Ideas of fo unding an Abyssinian colony were combined with a suggestion that the Abyssinian Church be brought into a union with Russian Orthodoxy . The head of the Abyssinian Church decided that Russia ought to take not only the Abyssinian Church under her protection, but also the related Coptic and Armenian Churches. This resulted in a series of embassies exchanged between St. Petersburg and the Emp eror Menelik; and the Russian delegations usually comprised both military and ecclesiast ical personnel. At the Fashoda incident in July 1898 , a Russian colonel commanded the Abyssinian army in support of the French challenge to Britain. In the context of this peculiar military­ ecclesias tical situat ion, Gurd jieff's supposed visit to Abyssinia takes on a very diff erent coloring. The chief area of Russian expa nsion, however, was Cent ral Asia. Russian occ upation of the khanates at the head of the Oxus had been fo llowed by a"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE SEEKER FOR TRUTH 47 steady push into the sparsely populated areas of Kashgar and Turkestan. In this context, Gurdjieff makes one quite remarkable admission about his travels in Central Asia. \"Of course,\" he writes, \"for journeys taken on behalf of some government or other for a certain political aim and for which large sums are allocated, . . . one might hire as many porters as one wishes to pack and unpack everything .\" This is an almost explicit statement that he did undertake political missions in Central Asia, and it fits very neatly with the most persistent rumors about his work on behalf of Russian Intel­ ligence. In 1892-the year which GurdjielI himself selects as a watershed in his activities-he would have turned eighteen. This coincides too closely with the advent of military age to avoid reemphasis in the light of the rumor about his evasion of military service. From this year onward, GurdjielI's activities must all lie under suspicion of being associated with political intrigue; and his involvement with the Cretan revolt at the age of twenty­ two may have been the exploit of an already seasoned campaigner. This means that his own version of his early years is probably misleading in countless nonphilosophical ways, and only when evidence is available from other sources can anything be said for certain. The trail, which begins when we take for granted Gurdji eff 's career in espionage, does lead to such evidence; and this provides the date of birth which has been assumed in this chapter, as well as other personal details. It was in Tibet-that most obvious of places from which a bogus mystic might flaunt his credentials, and therefore a fitting port of call for a man who later delighted to impersonate the charlatan-that Gurdjieff broke cover. The invisible man appears in the annals of the history of crime."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"2 The Great Game By 1900 the regions through which the Seekers for Truth are supposed to have traveled had become areas of anxious concern to Imperial Russia and the British Raj. The remoteness of those mountainous frontier lands which spoke to Theosophists of divine wisdom meant sleepless nights for English and Russian empire builders alike. In Mgh anistan and Tibet, agents recruited by either side collected intelligence or attempted to win over the inhabitants to the cause of Delhi or St. Petersburg. As well as being the age of the great explorers, the turn of the century was the high point in the clandestine battle for India which became known to the British as the Great Game. Exploration was easily used as a cover for activities of another sort. For example, a geologist supposedly named \"Bogdanovitch,\" who was a member of Prjevalsky's last expedition, was widely rumored to be in reality Colonel Alexei Nikolaievitch Orlov of the Russian General Staff. Officials of the Government of India kept a watbhful eye on the states of the Himalaya and the Pamirs. The picture of undercover rivalry given by Rudyard Kipling's Kim is not far from the truth. In response to the Russian overtures to Tibet, the British in India senf out agents known as \"pan dits\"-like Kipling's \"fearful man\" Huree Babu-of whom the most famous was Sarat Chandra Das who actually spent several weeks in Lhasa. Kim was published in 1901 when the Game had been in progress for some time. Two years later, the expedition of Colonel Younghusband set out from 48"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAME 49 India for Tibe t. The small British force entered Lhasa in 1904, after the Dalai Lama had fled north into the Gobi Desert with a mysterious figure known to British Intelligence as \"the Lama Dordji eff.\" This Dordjieff was believed to be the main Russian agent in Tibet, and his great influence on the Dalai Lama had been used by Lord Curzon to persuade a reluctant government to agree to Younghusband's expedition in the first place. One of the most intriguing rumors to attach themselves to Gurdjieff is that he and Dordjieff were the same man. Stories that Gurdjieff had been vaguely connected with the Tsarist Intelligence Service in Tibet began to circulate soon after his arrival in Europe. J. G. Bennett, who met him while serving as an officer in British Intelligence in Constantinople in 1920, has recorded that his first informa­ tion about Gurd jieff came in a file from the Government of India warning him about Gurd jieff 's shady past. On one of the visits which Gurdjieff made to London early in 1922, he was interviewed by a police or security organization and accused of having been a Tsarist agent. Gurdjieff, of course, denied the charge, but it is possible that this old score was behind the failure of his eminent supporters to secure him a permit of residence in Britain and their subsequent difficulties in persuading the French au­ thorities to let him stay in France. The legend that Gurdjieff was the Lama Dordji eff was widely believed by his Western disciples. The evidence which made the idea of Gurd jieff-Dordjieff widely known was published by Rom Landau in 1935 in a book called God Is My Adventure, a bestselling survey of contem porary spiritual leaders. Landau's source was the writer Achrned Abdullah, who met Gurdjieff at a New York luncheon given by John O'Hara Cosgrave, a former editor of the New York World and a follower of Gurdjieff's discip le, Orage. Abdullah was as­ tounded to find that the famous guru had been one of his opposite numbers in Tibet in 1903. \"I was convinced that he was Lama Dord jieff,\" he wrote to Rom Landau. \"I told him so-and he winked. We spoke in Tadjik.\" Claude Bragdon, another writer who witnessed this incident, recorded that \"Gurd jieff, through Orage, acknowledged that he had been in Lhasa, saying that his political activities had been but a cloak to his religious interests: he was there studying Buddhist theology, he explain ed.\" \"Achmed Abdul lah\" was the pseudonym used by a writer and adventurer who would never- reveal his true name. His autobiography was published the year before God Is My Adventure, and it is as colorful and romantic as any of his novels. Abdul lah (1881 -1945) was the son of a Russian father and an Mg han mother. His great-uncle was Abdur Rahman, and he had a brother who was a Cossack colonel.

His romances come out of the same stable as the more novelistic passages in Meetings with Rema rkable Men. To play the Great Game eviden tly demanded imagination as well as courage. It is possible that Gurdjieff had made some prior arrangement with Achmed Abdullah. In some respe cts they were birds of a fe ather, used to the subtleties of Oriental intrigue and exaggeration. But the story has many marks of authenticity. Abdullah knew much more about the Lama Dordjieff than was common property in the 1930s, and he had certainly been in the right place at the right time. Although he was mistaken, his story is the first real clue to finding Gurdji eff 's trail. In the Great Game, smoke rarely occurred without fire, and Abdullah gave a circu mstantial picture of Gurdjieff-Dordjieff. \"He spoke Russian, Tibetan, Tartar, Tadjik, Chinese, Greek, strongly accented French and rather fantastic English. As to his age-well-I would say ageless. A great man who, though he dabbled in Russian impe rialistic politics, did so-I have an idea-more or less in the spirit of jest.\" He concluded with a verdict on Gurdjieff which has become famous. \"I am a fairly wise man. But I wish I knew the things which Gurdjieff had forgotte n.\" What romantic could resist the vision of the master of both spiritual and temporal things which Abdullah conjured up? Gurdji eff's reputation as a political maestro had reached epic proportions. Louis Pauwels even records rumors that he was in Tibet \"in 1903, and again in 1905, 1906, 1907 and 1908\" together with Professor Karl Haushof er, the mentor of Rudolph Hess. Pauwels and his collaborator Jacques Bergier devote a long section of their bestselling The Dawn of Magic (1960) to arguing the existence of an occult plot involving Gurdjieff, Hausho fer, and certain eccen trics who presided over the birth of the Nazi Party. Various aberrations taken from nineteenth-century Theosophy are used to manuf acture a sinister center of diabolism located in Tibet and to create a new picture of Gurdjieff as the agent of the \"King of Fear,\" in Shamballa, whose mystical mission was to destroy the intellectuals of the West ... . Unfortunately, this theory will not do, although the idea even passed-in a dignified, academic form-into a scholarly work by K. M. Pannikar, Asia and Western Dominance (1953). The occult ravinggo.apart, it was ve ri soon after the publication of Monsieur Gurd jieff that Alexandra David-Neel, who had spent several years in Tibet and had adopted a Tibetan lama as her son, published an article directly denying that Gurdjieff and Dordjieff had anything in common. She attributed the confusion to the similarity of the two names and published a photograph of Dordjieff to prove that by no stretch of the imagination could one face develop into the other. Gurdjieff hims elf told his pupils that he had once been given a Tibetan pass by an official who mistook the initial syllable of his name and described him as"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAME 51 \"Dor dj ieff. \" Somewhere among files long since va nished may lie a clue to a mist ake which resulted in British Intelligence organizations confusing -as Achmed Abdullah himself may have confused-the master and the pupil. A case based solely on the available docu ments of the Great Game could leave the impression that there was no doubt about the matter; howeve r, the evidence also includes a collection of photographs which is particularly perplex ing. Some could well be pictures of the young Gurd jieff, others appa rently could not, and at least one photograph has obviously been tampered with before publicat ion. Although all are supposed to show the same man, there must be considerable doubt whether they in fa ct do so. This presents a peculiar proble m. It is stretching coincidence too fa r to argue that another adve nturer, resembling Gurd jieff in many partic ulars , was in the same area at the same time. On the other hand, a case which acce pted all the photographs at their fa ce value could not sta nd. There seem to be good reasons fo r suggesting that some of the photographs have been confused or made to lie fo r subterranean purpos es; but a reader might plausibly retort that this belief was the result of an idee fixe on the autho r's part. The only solution seems to be to describe the inquiry step by step and to leave the verdict open. It is, first of all, certain that any tra veler, however innocent, who ventured into so sensitive an area would be inves tigated and his name pass into the files of the Great Game at Delhi, Simla, and Whitehall . By his own admission Gurd jieff was in Tibet while these files were open. Then, there are significant resemblances between the sacred dances of Tibet and Gurdjieff 's own. Next, halfway through the thicket of Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson, the reader stumbles acro ss an outburst directed specifically at the Younghusband Expedition . 'The genial exasperation of Beelzebub with human fo lly is directed at denouncing the way mankind inf al libly overturns the social organizations created by the great religious teache rs. Things were going quite well in Ti bet, says Beelzebub, owing chiefly to its isolat ion; and a part of the teaching of \"Saint Lama\" was actually applied in daily lif e. The result was re joicing among certain cosmic authorities that some aims of the fo under of Lama ism might actually be ach ieved . But your fa vourites did not allow even this to happen , but by their \"milit ary expedition\" or Anglo-Tibetan war, without so much as a thought, knocked this possibility soundly on the head . About this \"mili tary expedition\" I will tell you a little late r. And I shall tell you about it chiefly because I myself happened by chance to be an eyew itness of all those lamentable events. This passage about Tibet also occurs in a typescript version of Beelzebub's Tales which dates from before Achmed Abdullah's letter to Rom Landau ."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE With these various indications it was almost certain that a thorough search would reveal something. To anyone familiar with Meetings with Remarkable Men and the ident ifiable style of Gurdjieffian cunning, it will not come as a surprise that the first clue to a possible nom de guerre adopted by Gurdjieff had to do with phonographs and led to the discovery of a highly suspi cious character coming from the general area of the Caucasus, using an unnecessary number of false names and carrying to Dordjieff and the Dalai Lama a strange assortment of baggage, which included a phonograph and its blank wax rolls for recording. Two rumors current among the followers of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky provide some confirma tion of the identification which follows. The first is that Gurdji eff ' s mistrust of the British resulted from their having interned him in India. The second-for which the source is P. D. Ouspensky-is that Gurdjieff had a wife and children \"elsewher e.\" (This latter piece of gossip accounts for the fact that the woman later known as Gurdji eff 's \"wife\" never took the name of \"Gurdji eff \" but always remained \"Madame Ostrowsky.\") Both conditions are fulfilled by the man who called himself Ovshe or Ushe Narzunoff, although the existe nce of his family is bound up with the perplexing question of the photographs. Even if Ushe Narzunoff were not the same person as G. I. Gurdjieff, it is hard to believe that his activities were not related to Gurdji eff 's own exploits in \"those for me extremely memorable places,\" the mountains of Tibe t. The Government of India first took notice of Narzunoff in March 1900. It is not clear whether this was as the result of definite information or simply because of a security-conscious attitude toward Russian travelers. Narzunoff 's suspicious contacts were later disclosed by the Reverend Graham Sandberg, the Anglican chaplain at Darjeeling. Sandberg was the author of a Tibetan grammar and an expert on Tibetan affairs; on behalf of the Government of India and the Great Game, he kept his ear very close to the ground. He connected Narzunoff with the Lama Dordjieff and with an equally mysterious Tibetan called Badmaieff who was closely linked to the Tsar of Russia. Before Narzunoff landed in India, the word had already been passed that he should not be allowed to cross the frontier to Tibet. On March 6, 1900, there arrived in Calcutta from Marseilles aboard the S.S. Dupleix a man bearing a passport issued by General Nipi Khoraki, the Governor of Stavropol, dated September 29, 189 9. This described him as \"Ovshe Moutchkindoff Norzunoff \" -the name was at other times spelled Narzunoff, Norzanaff and Norzan ong-but when ·Narzunoff registered at the Continental Hotel, Calcutta, it was under the name of Myanoheid Hopityant, who was described as belonging to \"the Post and Telegraph Department, Sanga ta, Stavropolsk Governmen t.\" He had a letter of introduction to the Fren ch consul from a professor in Paris-th is was"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE GREAT GAME 53 probably a M. Joseph Deniker of whom there will be more to say. But as he spoke only Mong olian and Russian, the French consul sent him to a Mr. Brans on, the Accountant-General for Bengal, who knew the latter language and could be expected to help him on his way. Narzunoff told Branson that he had once before been through Calcutta to Tibet via Darjeeling and that he now intended proceeding again to Tibet with a case of presents for the Dalai Lama. He explained that the presents were from himself in gratitude for previo us kind treatment and as an offering to the head of the Buddhist Church. On March 10, Narzunoff left Calcutta for Darjeeling-in a co nsiderable panic, as it later appeared-and on the way, stayed at Ghoom with a lama from Bhutan named Serap Gyatsho. On March 12, the traveler was inter viewed at Ghoom by the Darjeeling Police. Under questi oning, he proved undeniably shifty, although some trouble probably arose merely because of language difficulties. At his first interview in March Narzuno ff-unaccountably dressed as a Chine se-told the following story. In January of the previous year \"he had passed through the Darjeeling district on his way to Peking, where he purchased some 9,000 rupees ' worth of goods for trading purp oses, and returned with them by a French steamer to Calcutta, left the goods in the Calcutta Custom House, and proceeded to Ghoom enroute to Yatung, where he intended remaining until he received remittances from his agents in Tibet and Mongolia; he averred that he was a trader pure and simple, and disowned the names of Norzunoff and Myanoheid Hopityant, stating that he had never made use of them. \" His real name, he said, was Obishak, and he was evidently trying to give the impression that he was a merchant, concerned chiefly with the trade between Tibet and China. But on March 27, heehanged his tune and admitted that he had come from Paris and had also visited St. Petersburg and Berlin. A week later he confused his story yet again by muddling the ships on which he had traveled. He was detained at Ghoom until the end of August. Meanwhile the Calcutta Customs had investigated the baggage which Narzun off had left behind in bond. His personal effects included a telescope, tWo phono graphs, a camera, and \"one rifl e\"-this last officially italicized . The weapon, a .45 caliber sporting rifle sighted up to 450 yards, was confiscated, and Narzuno ff was allowed to take away his personal luggage. But he was also in charge of thirty-one cases which he had imported as cargo and which eVidently caused the customs officials a certain a mount of perplexity. A single case contained some spirit lamps, a quantity of coral, photog raphic film, and silk. The remaining thirty held 590 metal bowls together with apparatus for suspending them, and their use was a matter for guesswork. At som e time during Narzuno ffs detention, his agents, Thomas Cook and Son, took these cases in charge and apparently"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE delivered them to several lam as, including \"a Tsan�te Khamba (who is believed to be no other than Dordj i.efl)\" whom Narzunoff had summoned fr om Lhasa.

He applied to the Deputy Commissioner of Police at Dar jeeling fo r the subsistence allowance which the Bengal Government had ordered be provided fo r him, but ref used to accept the meager stipend of one rupee a day which he was off ered. While Narzunoff was cooling his heels at Ghoom, the Dar jeeling Police took detailed notes about him. The description circulated was of a man, \"height about 5 fe et 10 inches, broad and well built, head now shaved, Mong olian fe atures, slight moust ache twisted down Chinese fa shion, medium complexion. \" He gave his age as twenty- six. This appears to have been correct, as the wily Police Commissioner discovered a photograph given by Narzunoff to a Mong olian lama during the period of his detention, on the back of which was writ ten: \"In kind remembrance to the Mong olian Lama Yarphel from Ovisha Mu chknoff Norsuno ff, 26th July 1900, on the 26th year of his age. \" Not much ' reliance can be placed on a single prepositi on, \"on,\" which has had to survive translation fr om Narzunoff 's inscription and probable mauling by Anglo-Indian Eng lish, otherwise we might think that this revealed Gurd jieff's exact birth date . The photograph was reproduced and circulated by the Dar jeeling Deputy Commissioner, who was later able to identify Narzun off -Io oking most un-Mong olian­ from this print. For Narzunoff was officially declared persona non grata. On August 2, 1900, the Government of India decided to deport him to Russia \"on the ground that it was undesir able that a Mongolian or quasi-Russian adven­ turer with several alias es should trade with Tibet through British India, and that though Norzanoff 's goods seemed to be harmless, his intentions might be the rever se. \" He left India fo r Odessa on August 31, in the very ship which had brought him. In a final examination bef ore his departur e, Narzunoff disclosed three of the fo ur names which enable a reconstruction of his affi liations in the Great Game. Besides his passport and a letter of introduction fr om the General Secr etary of the Paris Geographical Society, he carried a letter from Prince Ukhtomsky, the editor of the newspaper, Riga Viedomosti . Ukhtomsky described Narzunoff as a zaissan or noble of the Kalmuck Buddhi sts, and declared that he was a member of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society who was \"undertaking a journey to Tibet both on a religious pilgrimage and in the interests of science and commerce .\" Narzunoff seems to have decided to make a clean breast of his concerns to the Calcutta Police ; he was , he said, \"travelling at the expense of a very rich"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAME 55 Lama of Chinese Mongolia who lives in Urga, about 350 miles south of Irkutsk.\" The name of this lama was \"Akc hwan Darjilicoff \"-whom the British authorities at once identified with Dordjieff. Dordjieff had visited London and Paris and wished to make presents to the lamas in Tibet of \"special utensil s\"-the mysterious bowls-wh ich he had failed to obtain in St. Petersbu rg and so ordered from \"J. Denmiker and Cie., 8 Rue Buffon, Paris.\" N arzunoff was acting as courier on Dord jieff's behalf. A fourth name must be added to the names \"Ukhtomsky,\" \"Dordjieff \" and \"Deniker\" before the full tally of Narzun off 's spon sors is complete . This name is that of the strange character Shamz aran Badmaieff, who appears frequently in the archives of the Great Game and whom the suspicious British considered to be Narzun off's spymaste r. The concerns of Gurdjieff paralleled those of Badmaieff in many respects, and this similarity of interests is another good argument for assuming Gurdjieff and Narzunoff to be the same person. To make the relationship of these unfamilar characters intelligible, their history must be reconstructed. The common interest of the group was in Russian expansion in Central Asia. Both Badmaieff and Dordjieff were Buryat Mongols from Russian territory around Lake Baikal. The Buryats assumed great importance in the Russian plans to penetrate Tibet, because their Buddhist faith allowed them access to the Forbidden City of Lhasa, whereas Europeans were turned back at the Tibetan border. As the political importance of Russian Buddhists increa sed, the Buryats themselves developed a degree of self-con­ sciousness. Their intellectuals came to St. Petersburg and Mosco w for educ ation and a printed literature sprang up. Such happenings were associa ted with the activities of Dordjieff and Badmaieff, both of whom were concerned with developments that were political as well as cultural. The long arm of the Russian Government stretched across Cent ral Asia with the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The first stone of the sector inland from Vladivostok was laid in 1891 by Nicholas II when as Tsarevitch he traveled round the world. By 1898 the line was open with the exception of the section around Lake Baikal-about which Badmaieff had strong views-and a stretch along the Amur river. Eighteen ninety-eight is the year in which Ushe Narzunoff steps into recorded history. Shamzaran Badmaieff (1851-1919) was educated at Irkutsk and St. Petersburg University, where he studied Chinese-Mo ngolian languages. He became converted from Buddhism to Orthodox Christianity and changed his name to Peter Alexandrovitch, at a ceremony where the Tsar Alexander III acted as godfather. From this time on, Badmaieff enjoyed a relationship of extraord i�ary fav or with Alexander and his son Nicholas II,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE both of whom leaned heavily on his advice on Eastern questions. In 1875 Badm aieff left his lecturing job at the University and held a post in the Civil Service until 1893. His value to Nicholas II was not simply that of a political advisor. He practised \"Tibetan medicine\" in an apothe cary's shop which became a resort of fashionable St. Petersburg. On the birth of the hemophiliac Tsarevitch, Nicholas and his wife Alexandra found a new use for the mysterious Badm aieff and his medicines. Even the advent of Raspu tin­ with whom Badmaieff was on excellent terms-ne ver weakened his position at court, although outside the circl,e of the Tsar and the Tsaritsa, he made many enemies. It was rumored that the patients at his clinic had political information recorded on their files, and his name was often coupled with those of Rasputin and the other gurus who attempted to establish a hold over the credulous Imperial couple. But Badm aieff stood head and shoulders above the crowd of magi and holy fools who clamored round the steps to the throne . This was simply because of his very obvious abilities. In 1917 he was arrested by the Bolsheviks on his way to join monarchist sympathizers in Finland; and in jail he made a deep impression even on his sceptical captors. Agwan Dordjieff (d. 1938) was another remarkable Buryat, very close in age to Badm aieff. He was born about 1850 at Cherniskaia in the Russian province of Verknie-Udinsk, and educa ted success ively at Gandan (the , lamaic college at Urga in Mongolia) and at the huge monastery of Drepung, a few miles northwest of Lhasa. Here he acquired the degree of Tsanit Khanpo, which is roughly translated as Professor (or Abbot) of Metaphysical Theology. His career blossomed when he became tutor to the thirteenth Dalai Lama. It seems likely that it was Dordjieff\" s care which prevented the early death by poison or unexplained accident which had been the fate of so many of his pupil's predecessors, and when the Dalai Lama attained his majority, Dordjieff's vigilance was rewarded. He was given the title of \"Work-Washing Abbot,\" a post which carried the duty of censing the Dalai Lama's chambers with perfumed water. Thus he was still closely attached to the person of the Dalai Lama after his period of tutorship was over. The British Secret Service, who saw him as a rich and powerful gray eminence, were not inaccurate in their assumptions. Aceording to the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner, Dordjieff became a Russian agent in 1885, two years after the fourth expedition of Prjevalsky in which he took part. Dordjieff's influence extended outside the borders of Tibet and over the hundreds of thousands of Russian Buddhists-the Buryats of Central Asia and the Kalmucks of the region round Astrakhan at the head of the Caspian Sea. The Dalai Lama appointed him as the agent who traveled through"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAME 57 these areas preaching, distributing \"life pills\" and collecting tribute for the exchequer. Dordji eff 's particular concern was to establish institutes of higher education in the various Kalmuck districts where these were lacking, and in 1906, a declaration supporting this plan was issued by the Russian Department of Foreign Creeds. Not content with establishing schools for his own faith, Dordjieff executed an auda cious coup by building a Buddhist temple in St. Petersburg itself. When this project became public about 1911, a scandal of ferocious proportions broke out as the clergy of Holy Russia fulminated against the incursion of heathendom, and the plan was completed only with the support of powerful sympa thizers. One of thes� was Prince Ukhto msky of the Department of Foreign Creeds. Dordjieff was a man of exceptional abilities. Apart from his political and religious activity, he found time to adapt the Tibetan alphabet to Buryat needs. He was a member of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and contributed notes to its publications. He spoke Fren ch as well as Asian languages and traveled through Western Europe where he held Buddhist services in Paris, Vienna, and Rome and visited the Vatican. After the Russian Revolution, he was exiled to Leningrad where he spent most of his time in the temple he had built, until his arrest and imprisonment a year before his death in 1938. The picture of the Master of Heaven and Earth has-it must be admi tted-a basis in reality. The Government of India was perfectly correct in assuming that Dordjieff intended them no good. Although it is not clear whether he and Badmaieff agreed completely on the destiny of Central Asia, it was certainly in the interests of both to cooperate in attac hing Tibet securely to the Russian sphere of influence. The Tibetans-or at least those of Dordjieff s party, which included the Dalai Lama himself -were apprehensive of the vast British power which had already established itself in Kashmir and was tangling with the Russians in Afghanistan. Dordjieff began diplomatic moves to encourage the Russians to act as a counterforce, while Badmaieff made propaganda on the Tsar's behalf. Their campaign is best approached through the .figure of Prince Esper Espe rovitch Ukhto msky, who was a good friend to both of them. Ukbtomsky was an Orientalist and came of a family with interests in Central Asia. He made an extensive collection of objects and manuscripts relating to the Buddhism of Mongolia and Tibet, most of which he housed in Irkutsk, and this deep interest in Buddhism led him to enter the Department of Foreign Creeds (which controlled non-Christian religions within the Empire). Besides being editor of the Riga Viedomosti , he was a director of the Russo-Chinese Bank. Most significantly, Ukhto msky was of the extremely myst ical temperament common to the Russian intelligentsia"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"58 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE of the turn of the century, and claimed-in a catalogfie of his Tibetan and Mongolian collection published outside Russia-that he had been a practicing Buddhist since the age of fifteen. In 1890 and 1891 Nicholas II, while still Tsarevitch , undertook the journey around the world during which he opened construction on the Tra ns-Si berian Railway. Ukhtomsky was seconded from the Department of Foreign Creeds to act as recorder to the expedition. In his huge and lavish acco unt of the journey, the chro nicler betrays his expa nsionist sentiments at every opportunity. Russia was more Oriental than Western, he insisted, and emphasized the \"inner\" kinship of Indian and Russian peasants. The reason fo r all this fe llow fe eling was crystal clear. \"We are , and must be,\" declared Ukhtomsky, \"supported by the idea of an ever-possible advance of the irresistible North over the Hindu Kus h.\" It may have been because of the personal sympathies of this mystical imperialist or because of the natural inclination of Nicholas that the party visited the headquarters of the Theosophi cal Society at Adyar on February 7, 1891. Ukhtomsky knew all about Mme. Blavatsky, \"our talented countrywoman ,\" and translated her colleague Colonel Olcott's Buddhist catechi sm into Mongolian. His description of the Theosophical Society is signif icant. \"At the insistence of H. P. Blavatsky, a Russian lady who knew and had seen much, the idea sprang up of the possibility, and even the necessity, of fo unding a society of theosophists, of searchers fo r the truth * in the broadest sense of the word, fo r the purpose of enlisting adepts of all creeds and race s, of penetrating deeper into the most secret doctrines of oriental religion s, of drawing Asiatics into true spirit ual communion with educated fo reigners in the West, of keeping up secret relations with diff erent high priests, ascetics, magician s, and so on. \" Ukhtomsky saw support fo r his ideas of Russian expansion in the \"readiness of the Indians to group themselves under the banner of this strange northern woma n.\" He argued that Mme. Blavatsky had been fo rced to leave India by \"the suspiciousness of the English. \" Although this may simply represent a protest by the Theosoph ical Prince aga inst unkind rej ection of Mm e. Blavatsky's very dubious \"mirac les,\" it raises the specter of the notorious accu sations that the fo undress of Theosophy was in India as a Russian spy. These accusations came not only fr om paranoid colonial officia ls, but also from one of the lady's own countrym en, and there is some evidence that Badmaieff himself was in contact with Mme. Blavatsky. The combination of an occult quest and intelligence work was not as impr obable as it may sound, and if Mm e.

The campaign of Russia n expansion in which Badmaieff, Dordjieff, and Ukhtomsky played a part was the same as that in which Ushe Narzunoff became swept up. Some documents from Badma ieff s own archives enable us partially to reconstruct its progress. In April 1894, Badmaieff began what he referred to as his \"real activitie s,\" building up Russian influence in Central Asia. He kept in touch with Dordjieff and Ukhtomsky, and all three shared a brand of mystical imperialism. Dordjieff had visions of a pan-Mongol state under Russian protection. In his efforts to bring this about, he made use of the Mongolian belief in the coming of the Kingdom of Shamballa (\"source-of-all-Iuck\"), traditionally said to be situated in the north and therefore, to be equated with Russia. In 1896 Ukhtomsky was writing that the Mongols saw the Tsar as an incarnate Buddha. \"The Tibeta ns,\" he hinted, \"who keep up very near relations with our Buryats, are gradually but deeply imbibing identical ideas .\" As the campaign among the Mongols gathered momentum, Bad­ maieff began to trumpet success. \"My arrival on the fronti er,\" he announced to Nich olas II on January 15, 1897, \"has shaken the whole of the Buddhist world . . . Buryats, Mongols and especially lamas . . . were always repeating that the time had come to extend the frontiers of the White Tsar in the east . . . . \" Not long afterward Prince Ukhtomsky turned up in Ceylon. On April 23, he met the President of the Theosophical Society, Colonel Olcott, at Colombo, and the pair went joyriding in an outrigger canoe. The Prince told Olcott that he was on his way to China with presents for the Emperor an d a message from the Tsar, and invited him to join him on the return trip which he intended to make via the lamasaries of Mongolia. Dordjie ff s role at this stage of the Great Game is equivocal. It seems most likely that he was not the direct agent of Russia like Ukhtomsky or Badmaieff, but that he found it convenient to cooperate with their schemes to ensure the continued independence of Tibet. But as time wore on, Badmaieff increased his pressure on the Tsar to support a policy of direct annexation. \"Am I,\" he inquired, \"merely to organise trade, in order to widen our commerc ial-political influence in the East for further needs, or am I to prepare the ground for a final annexation . . . systemat ically occupying im[>9rtant points with the help of Buryats and Mongols?\" His recommendation was quite open. \"Tibet, being the highest plateau in Asia, dominating the Asian continent, should obviously be in Russi an hands. With Tibet in her power, Russia will certainly be able to force England to be more complian t.\" ."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE From London, Lord Curzon was pursuing a similar policy with regard to the Government of India. He too argued that Tibet was a key point dominating Cent ral Asia and that his own gov ernment must beware of the machinatio ns of the rival empire. It has been the fa shion to write off such suspicions as proceeding from the imagination of an ambitious imperialist, but evidence shows that his intelligence service was correct in pointing the finger at Dordjieff and Badmaieff. In fa ct, the vigilance of the British simply resulted in driving Tibet further into the embrace of the White Tsar; and Dord jieff's anxious search fo r a protector provided the final lever which Curzon was able to use to persuade his own gov ernment to interv ene. Dord jieff made his first visit to St. Petersburg in 1898. Younghusband later heard a rumor that he had made contact with the Tsar and Tsaritsa through Rasputin, but Badmaieff is the more obvious cha nnel. In 1900 Dordjieff was presented to the Tsar, and in the fo llowing year, he returned to Russia at the head of a mission fr om Tibet. The Mission of 1901 became a red rag to the British. Russia had obviously stolen a march on Britain and a military expedition was the only answer. The Younghusband Expedition crossed the Tibetan fro ntier in July 1903. Two years had elapsed since the Dordjieff Mi ssion to St. Petersburg. During this time reports kept reaching the Govern ment of India of renewed Russian activity in Cen tral Asia, and when the British expedition finally reached Lhasa, rumors came back that Dordjieff had established an arsenal there and was manuf act uring rifles. But before the arrival of the British, he and the Dalai Lama had va nished into the Gobi Desert. They are supposed to have arrived at the monastery of Gandan in November 1904. After this point the atte ntion of the Russian agents in Central Asia was diverted by the Russo-Japanese War; and Badmaieff and Ukhtomsky redirected their energies to ensuring that the Buddhist tribes remained loyal to the Tsarist reg ime. \"Ushe Narzun off\" was in the thick of the plotti ng and counterplotting which surrounded Dord jieff's mission to St. Petersburg in 1901. His exploits should be seen agai nst the general back ground of Russian es­ pionage in Central Asia and the specific eff orts of Badmaieff to recruit likely candidates fo r his intelligence network. \"I am tra ining young men in two capitals -Peking and Petersbu rg-fo r further activiti es,\" Badmaieff in­ fo rmed the Tsar; and if Gurd jieff had wanted to penet rate Tibet, the context in which he could most easily have done so was in that of this opera tion. In 1924 Wilhelm Filchner published the memoirs of one of Badmai eff's \"young men,\" the Buryat Tser empil, who claimed to have been recruited by Dord jieff at an early age . Tserempil was trained in the Indian Section of the Russian General St aff fo r \"exploration and intelligence work\" and sent on missions to Calcutta and Peshawar. It is significant that at the exact time"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE GREAT GAME 61 when Narzunoff fell foul of the British authoritie s, Tserempil was also engaged in a mission through India, and like Narzun off, he went disguised as a Chinese.

His more immediate controller was known as \"Prof essor Stungevitch ,\" and worked from a base in the Pamirs . Acco rding to Tserempil, the Professor was the head of the Indian Section of Russian Intelligence ; and it is worth recal ling here Gurdj ieff's friendship with another professor, the archae ologist \"Skridlov .\" We possess the reports on Ushe Narzunoff which reached the Foreign Office in London; and also his own side of the story, which was edited by the French scholar Joseph Deniker. By the time this version of events was made public, Narzunoff had been exposed by the Government of India. He had been detained for a long period , and his physical appearance had been noted in minute detail by the Police Commissioner at Darjeeling. Narzunoff knew that his description had been taken down , and he mentions this fact in his diar ies. For undercover work, he had become a decided risk, and it is quite possible that the reminiscen�es which he allowed Joseph Deniker to publish were designed to repair his damaged cover story and distract attention from the nonreligious activities of his master, Dordjieff. Joseph Deniker (1852-1918) was of French origin but born in Astrakhan . He studied chemistry in Moscow and St. Petersburg, became interested in anthropology, and moved to Paris where he obtained his doctorate and was appointed librarian of the Museum of Natural History. Apart from his work on scientific bibliography , he published a series of books on racial characteristi cs, most notably Races and Peoples of the World (1900). Because of his upbringing, he spoke Russian, and made a speciality of Buddhism and Oriental languag es. This resulted in his becoming the chief means of communi cation between the Russian experts on Central Asia and the Western world : Deniker would translate articles appearing in the Russian scientific press into French and was in constant correspondence with v. V. Grigoriev, the Secretary- General of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society . He knew Prince Ukhtomsky, and his interest in Buddhism led to his introduction to Agwan Dord jieff through the dis­ tin gU ished Orientalist, Sylvain Levi. Deniker remained in touch with Dordjieff and did him many favors. When the Times correspondent with the Younghusband Expedition published his account of the sinister role attributed to Dord jieff, Deniker criticized this as \"much exaggerat ed.\" In 1898 Dord jieff made his first visit to St. Petersburg and passed on to Paris where he met Jo�h Dtm iker . On June 27, the Tsanit Khanpo celebrated a Tibetan ceremon y in the Musee Guimet with Dr. Deniker"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"62 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE acting as interprete r. On this visit Dordjieff was asked in the interests of science to record some prayers on a phonograph-the old-f ashioned kind with wax cylinders. He became enthusiastic and bought a machine with many cylin ders, saying that for purposes unspecified this magnificent invention could be of great use. On a second visit to Paris, Dordjieff entrusted Deniker with a most unusual commi ssion. The Tibetan priest was in search of steel, begging bowls for his monks, but these had by custom to be made from a single piece of metal. An expe riment with a German company had failed, as welding had been used on the bowl s, and it was Deniker's task to find a firm which would cast large numbers of vessels in accordance with lamaistic precepts . Ushe Narzunoff arrived in Paris in 1900 to fe tch these bowl s, which fo rmed the mysterious cargo that so puzzled the Indian Customs. This was the beginning of his acquaintance with Deniker, which culminated when Deniker published the narrative of his expeditions to Lhasa, based partly on Narzunoff's diaries and partly on conversations which took place in Paris in 1902, in the magazi ne Le Tour du Monde fo r 1904. Narzunoff may then have been collecting the special lightweight tse­ boum-a ritual object-which Dr. Deniker was having made by French crafts men fo r the Dalai Lama. His presence in Paris in 1902 shows witho ut any doubt that his journeys in central Asia did not end with the last journey he described to Joseph Deniker, that of 1901. It may well have been that he wished to establish his bona fides by releasing an explanation of his ill-fated journey with the begging bowls. While a brief account might indeed have allayed some suspicio ns, the quantity of detaiL published by Deniker provides countless reasons fo r considering that Narzunoff was not what he seemed. His story simply will not stand up. By the time it appeared in the press, the Government of India had more information connecting Narzunoff with Dord jieff and the operations of Russian Intelligence . And the reminiscences published by Joseph Deniker are packed with details which point to the conclusion that this suspicious customer -half pilgr im, half adventurer -was Gurdjieff hims elf. The question of the photographs which Deniker publish ed-and of others which he did not publish -will be considered separately . For the moment we shall concentrate on the diary and conversations which Deniker edited, and which he introduced with the remark that Agwan Dord jieff was \"to some extent the sponsor of Narzunoff 's journey s.\" Deniker's conversations with Narzunoff had been conducted in Russi an-in which language Narzu noff's diaries were writte n-with a few Kalmuck expressions thrown in which Deniker recognized from his childhood acquaintance with the language . Ushe Narzunoff began with the story of his upbringing as a Kalmuck"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAME 63 squire in the province of Stavropol , his education in a Cossa ck school and his nomadic life with his family on the steppes. He claimed to have met Dordjieff on one of his preaching trips among the Kalmuc ks. By his own account Narzunoff was a pious young man who was disgusted by the drun kenness of his fellows ; and Dordjieff had \"advised him to make a pilgrimage to Lhasa .\" In the light of his later activ ities it is quite clear that Dord jieff's interest in Narzunoff was much more than that of a general religious duty, and that the education Narzunoff possessed was more extensive than that of a Cossack school. However they came toget her, Narzunoff and his protector left Russia in August 1898, and trave led on the Trans-Siberian Railway as far as Verknie-Udinsk on Lake Baikal . From there they continued to Urga, and on October 5, Narzunoff was dispatched to Lhasa with a letter and gifts fo r the Dalai Lama from Dord jieff. Narzu noff's journey toward the Gobi Desert was not always by the obvious route. He called at several secluded monasteries, including the convent ofYoundoun-beissin-k ure-whi ch, he emphasized to Deniker, was not to be found on any maps of Mong olia- apparently in order to watch the ceremony known as \"tsam .\" This service was accompanied by mime and dancin g, fo r which the lamas don masks representing terrifying deities who appear to them in the state of dream or ecstasy called \"xan-tohi\" in Tibetan . Narzun off, theref ore, displayed an interest in sacred dances very shortly after beginning his expediti on. He proceeded by camel across the Gobi and on the south side of the desert fe ll in with a party of Mongols who offered to guide him into Tibet. Narzunoff 's account of his adventure with these guides makes it quite certain that he was not what he seemed, and was European to boot: On the way I told my guides that I was a Mongol, a Chinese subject, and that I was going t� Lhasa on a pilgrimage . Nonetheless, towards the end of the journey, my guides discovered my secret, and fo r two reason s: 1. In order to conceal the fact that I was a Russian sub ject, knowing 110w to read Russian, I also took notes in the diary of my journey in Kalmuck. But, because Kalmuck writing is slightly diff erent to Eastern Mongol script, my companions noticed it . . . 2. To keep warm I was wearing under my furs a jacket of European cut, [and] as I undressed during a halt the Mongols noticed my jacket. No doubt because of all this when we arrived in their native country, the Mongols began to say that I was a Russian subject, that I was wearing Russian clothe s and was keeping a travel-diary. In consequence , they refused to lead me to the agreed place . . . Why was a devout Kalmuck traveling under the protection of a Buryat dignitary wearing Western clothes? The inquirer might be fo rgiven for"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"64 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE doubting whether the differences between Kalmuck and Buryat script were as great as those between any fo rm of script and the Russian in which Narzunoff was undoubtedly keeping his diary -only this can explain the obtrusive \"also\" in the extract quoted above. The \"also\" is directed either at Deniker, the recorder of the conversati on, or by Deniker at his audience . Besides the Russ ian-\"which you see here, my dear Dr. Denike r,\" or \"which I have before me, my dear readers\"-Narzunoff was \"also\" keeping his diary in Kalmuck. He must have let his tongue run away with him in the memory of his narrow escape. Acco rding to Narzunoff he managed to bribe his companio ns, and their goodwill was secured when he burned his jacket before their eyes. Without further mishap he cros sed into Tibet and reached Lhasa, where he stayed a little over a month. He had an audience with the Dalai Lama, to whom he presented the gifts and letters he was carrying. The splendid ceremonial of the reception-Narzunoff claims that he passed through an escort of a hundred men- seems a little lavish fo r the private emis sary of the Dalai Lama's old tutor, and it is possible that Narzunoff's embassy was on behalf of others. He was entertained and rewarded with money. In his account of the episode, Narzunoff twice refers to Dord jieff as \"my master\"-no doubt in the sense of \"spiritual maste r\"-and this expression does seem to indicate the nature of the relatio nship between them. Narzunoff 's description of Lhasa is packed with observations on Tibet and its custom s. He left the holy city in April 1899, and in May arrived at Darjeeling where he hired a Chinese- speaking Mongol to act as his guide to Peking. Narzunoff was made extremely nervous by his guide's calm announcement that most others would have poisoned him for the money he carried, and had to submit to being grossly overcharged for all the services his companion performed. In Peking he escaped from his guide 's clutc hes and made his way through Mongolia to Urga, which he reached at the end of July. Acco rding to Narzunoff , he arrived back in his native steppes in August. Let us say that he traveled to the general area of the Cauca sus. The passport which the Governor of Stavropol issued to him was dated September 29, so it is possible that further journeys were contemplated immed iately . We know nothing of Narzunoff until his departure for Paris in January 1900, in the capacity of Dord jieff's messenger boy. He also had a commission from the Russian Geographical Society to take photographs of Lhasa. On his arrival on January 25, Joseph Deniker took him to a meeting of the Paris Geographical Society and introduced him to the secretary. Deniker's son, M. Georges Deniker, who as a boy offifteen, met Ushe Narzunoff on this occasion, remembers that he was gadget-crazy; he bought electric lamps , a camera, a tie pin which lit up, and, of course, a phonograph and its cylinders."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAM E 65 The love of mechanical marvels was something which Gurdjieff never lost; even the touch of the illuminating tie pin seems charac teristic. But it is the phonographs which seem to say most clearly, \"Here is Gurd jieff!\" The phonograph pervades his writings . For example, in Meetings with Re­ markable Men, he recalls how he was fo rced to leave in Moscow \"a few hundred\" of the songs his father sang, \"recorded on phonograph rolls.\" Almost certainly he intended to use this new invention for collecting traditional music in Asia. In Beelzebub's Tales, Gurdjieff gives a fatuous account of his birth in which an Edison phonograph is one of the actors; in Meetings with Remarkable Men, he describes how he once achieved a striking commercial success by recording popular songs and bawdy stories on the blank rolls of \"an Edison phonograph\" and renting out ear-phones in the bazaars. Whether this story is true is neither here nor there-there is a possible moral attached-but it shows the impact the phonograph made on Gurd jieff's mind. It even fo und its way into his teaching as one of his mechanical analog ies. By the time Beelzebub's Tales was written, phono­ graphs with rolls had given place to those with disks, and Gurd jieff used the comparis on-at least as early as 1919-- to describe the registration of sense impressions on the three appara tuses which he said were responsible for preserving past experi ences. \"They consist in adaptations recalling clean wax phonograph disks; on these 'disks' or, as they might otherwise be called, 'reels ,' all the impressions received begin to be recorded from the first days after the appearance of a man in the world, and even before, during the period of his formation in his mother's womb .\" At the beginning of March 1900, Narzunoff disemb arked in Calcutta with his cargo of begging bowls. His story goes that he learned from a Russian­ -�g contact that he would be prevented from reaching Tibet. \"Moved by the emotion of f ear,\" as he puts it, he donned his Chinese disguise and left for Dar jeeling with the ob ject of sending word to Tibet. He was detained by the authorities in Darjeeling, near which place he stayed with a Mongolian lama. In May three Tibetans arrived with a certificate that he was an innocent Buddhist pilgrim, and he felt free to take photographs without being clapped in prison. In August he was sent under armed escort to Calcutta where he was imprisoned for a week and then informed that he was to be deport ed. Meanwhile his eff orts to dispatch the begging bowls to Tibet were frustrated at every turn. He had managed to send three cases in charge of a trusted emissary, but the man died en route and his wife refused to surrender the good s. In Calcutta he suffered agonies because the remaining twenty-eight cases had been reclai med from the Customs by a \"powerful and unknown\" man during his detention in Darjeeling. The difficulty arose from the translation through several languages of the name of the powerful man-\"Koukan ssen,\" who proved to be Narzunoff 's agent, Thomas Cook and Son, whose capab le services not only whisked the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"66 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE begging bowls off to Lhasa, but forced the recalc itrant widow to disgorge her cache of loot. At his own request, the \"quasi-Russian adventurer\" was shipped off to Odessa rather than Paris or Peking. He arrived in Russia on October 3, 1900. The Government of India received information through Graham Sandberg that Dord jieff himself had passed through India and trave led separately to Odessa, where he and Narzunoff met Badmaieff and all three proceeded to Livadia in the Crimea. On October 15, the Journal de St. Peter sbourg announced the Tsar's reception of Dord jieff at Livadia. Somewhat naturally, the diaries of Us he Narzunoff make no mention ofthis association with royalty and instead offer a version which reeks of implausibility. \"As soon as I arrived back in my encampments ,\" he writes­ one wonders who was looking after the stock all this time-\"I had no further thought than to return again to Tibet. By a happy combination of circu mstances, the Tsanit Khanpo Agwan Dord jieff was in Siberia, in the Transbaikalia, his native land, and on the point of leaving for Lhasa. All that was necessary to make my master decide to wait for me in Urga were several exchanges of telegra ms.\" Such a coincidence and Narzunoff's hearing about it are manif estly impossible, and the gallant teller of tales was unlucky in the inf ormants of the Government of India. To rephrase the narrative in what was most probably its real sequence: Narzunoff accom­ panied Dord jieff from Livadia to Urga, which they left with six companions on January 5, 1901. This was a remarkable journey by any standar ds. If Narzunoff is to be believed, they arrived in Lhasa on February 28, having crossed the Gobi in a record time of two months, twenty-f our days. If we allow fo r some exaggerati on, it was still a vastly quick time (\"not for forest am I speciali st, but for san d,\" said Gurdjieff later) and there must have been some urgency . The reception of Dord jieffby the Tsar and his contact with Badmaieff could have provided the immediate causes. The necessity for speed was almost certainly because the plans of Dord jieff and .Badmaieff now called for the open reception by the Tsar of a Tibetan mission. Having decided on this irrevocable course, no doubt it was best to consult the Dalai Lama and send the mission on its way before the English somehow circu mvented the plan. Dord jieff and Narzunoff spent only a month in Lhasa before setting off again on their travels. During this time Narzunoff was once more presented to the Dalai Lama who inquired how the British had treated him in captivity. He was rewarded for his privat ions by the gift of a ceremonial tiger skin. Once a man had been allowed to sit on such a seat of honor in the presence of the Dalai Lama, his name was inscribed in a register and from then on the privilege was his by right . During his stay, Narzunoff could at last make use"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE GREAT GAME 67 of the camera which Grigoriev of the Imper ial Russian Geographical Society had given him, although he was fo rced to be circumspect beca use of the Tibetan ban on photography. He managed to photograph some of the principal buildings in Lhasa and on excursions outside the town he took several more pictur es. One of these trips took him to the Drepung, with its two thousand monks; another to the monastery of Sera with its surrounding hermitage s and a third to Galdan which preserved the lar gest collection of relics of Tsong Kapa, the fo under of the Yellow Hat sect of Buddhist lamas. On his way back from this last expediti on, Narzunoff saw and pho­ tographed a remarkable local custom-of which, as Gurdji eff, he makes particular note. This was the spectacle of pilgrims measuring their length round the perimeter of Lhasa. \"They let themselves fa ll full-length, get up and prostrate themselves again ,\" writes Narzunoff , \"having placed their fe et on the spot which they had earlier touched with their head. In this manner they go round the town in two or three days. \" A more extre me fo rm of devotion was practiced by those who fo llowed the same procedure-but measured the distance they could advance by the length of their fac es. In Beelzebub's Tales Gurd jieff inserts a completely isolated paragraph com­ menting on the pract ice , and one of the dances which he taught his pupils was based on this uncomf ortable maneuver-only it was said to be a Christian custom, native to the Caucasus. On March 28, Narzunoff left Lhasa fo r Ta shi-Lumpo where he was presented to the Panchen Lama. At first his acco unt is given in the first person, as if he was the sole or principal tra veler, but it soon appears that Dord jieff was one of the party. Because of the mountainous terra in, horses were out of the question and Narzunoff was fo rced to walk. In contras t, Dordjieffbehaved as a true Mongol, and hired a sherpa to carry him on his back into Nepal. It was an incongruous start to the fa mous Dord jieff Mission which so annoyed the British. In Nepal they spent five days, Narzunoff told Deniker, \"disguised as pilgri ms. \" From the King of Nepal they obtained permits to visit the holy places of Buddhism in the south and, armed with these documents, they succeeded in entering India. Between the Nepalese frontier and the Indian border they survived three customs inspections. Narzu noff had hidden half his photographic film in a box taped to his thigh, and the other half in a jar of flou r. His Russian passport was in the sole of his . boot. On May 10, the party reached the railhead where they had to submit to an interrogation about their purpose in visiting India. This inquisiti on, they were told, was because of the efforts of a certain Russian agent to penetrate Tibet the previous year. \"My life,\" records a nervous Narzu noff, \"was hanging by very thin threads. \" The mission was allowed their tickets to Bombay and proceeded from Bombay to Colombo where they embarked on the Russian steamer Tambo f,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"68 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE which reached Odessa on June 12. The St. Petersbu1ig Gazette announced the arrival of Dord jieff with an official embassy and carried an article by Badmaieff describing \"Owshe Norsinof\" as Dord jieff's \"secretary and translat or.\" Acco rding to Narzunoff 's journal, Dordjieff and he parted company at Odes sa-presumably to allow the homesick Narzunoff to return to his encampments. Unfortunately fo r this story , the Deputy Commis­ sioner at Darjeeling had obtained the photograph Narzunoff had given to his Mongolian friend during his detention. From this he identified him in a picture of a landau containing members of the Dordjieff Mission in St. Petersburg, published in The Graphic . Us he Narzunoff is bare headed, and in fo rmal dress with a medal on his chest. Wise after the event, the Deputy Commissioner plodded on his investigati ons. He suborned a Tibetan gUide called Pat-ma-wang-cha, who had acted as courier to the mission from Katmandu to Bombay, and discovered evidence which proved to his satisfaction that the fo ur allegedly Mongolian members of the Dordjieff party had in fact been Russians. The reasons which he gave for these suspicions were as follows : 1. They were not able to underst and Tibetan , or to make themselves understood to Tibeta ns, which they would have been if they had been Mong olian s. 2. One of them had a curious watch, which he showed to the Lama of the Buddhist Chorten at Katma ndu, and which he informed him had been bought in Russia, and was worth Rs 300. The lama also told him that they were really \"u-ru-su\" Russians. 3. They ate meat largely whenever they could get it. 4. One of them (the youngest) knew English, as he was always able to read the railway tickets and detect when they were overcharge d. The youngest of these \"Mongolian lamas ,\" when they got to Bombay, procured a suit of European clothes from somewhe re, and shaved hims elf, and went on board the ship as a European. There is something about that youngest lama -undoubtedly Narzun off­ which rings warning bells.

After July 1901, when Dord jieff was officially presented to the Tsar, he and his associates were fixed in the official mind as the oppositi on. Francis Younghusband was convinced by rumors which reached him that the outcom e of the mission was a proposal to send Badmaieff to Tibet, and in February 1902, reports from the pandit Sarat Chandra Das told him of a \"so-called Mongolian Missio n,\" with a Russian at its head, which had been"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE GREA T GAM E 69 received in Lhasa. Suspicion continued to mount until the British military expedition of July 1903 . Like Dordjieff, Narzunoff came into the open after the reception of the mission from Tibet. In October 1901, Joseph Deniker published his photograph of the Potala at Lhasa. It was the first photograph of Lhasa to be published and narrowly missed being the first taken. In 1902 Narzunoff visited Deniker in Paris, where he vo i unteered the information which the scholar published in two articles, one in the American magazine the Century in August 1903, and another the following year, in Le Tour du Monde . In the autumn of 1903, the Imperial Russian Geographical Society published a selection of Narzunoff' s photographs together with descriptions of those by the Buryat professor Tsybikov, another of Badma ieff's agents. None of the photographs of Narzunoff himself was published until after the British had reached Lhasa, by which time the news value of the story was immense. And although Deniker had the notes of his conversations with Narzunoff since 1902, he published nothing based on them until after the Younghusband Expedition. The evidence seems overwhelming that Narzunoff was, among other things, a Russian agent; and the appearance of his self-portrait as an innocent pilgrim and traveler was astutely timed to coincide with anti-British feeling after the Hight of the Dalai Lama. There is one further point which is relevant to Ushe Narzunoff and G. I. Gurdjieff . In November 1904, a large collection of Orientalia was sold in a Paris auction room. One part of this sale was devoted entirely to Tibetan items: over one thousand lots of statues, pictures, and manuscripts. For this Tibetan sale, Joseph Deniker and a colleague of his at the M usee Guimet wrote the catalogue. Deniker hinted that the collection might have been formed in Peking. But it was sold under the name of \"Collection G .... \" \"Th e business I preferred above all others, \" writes Gurdjieff in his essay, \"The Material Question,\" \"which never required my specially devoting to it any definite time or needed any fixed place of reSidence, and which moreover was very profitable was the trade in carpets and antiques of all kinds.\" Badmaieff's agent Tsybikov returned from Lhasa in 1901 with a huge collection of manuscripts, and if Gurdjieff was in Tibet at the time of the Younghusband Expedition in 1903-04, it would have been quite feasible for him to withdraw from the country after the disruption caused by the British invasion and to realize his assets. It is also possible-if Gurdjieff was Narzun off-that he may have acted as an intermediary for the sale of the \"Collection G ... ,\" and that his principal was the antique collector, Ukhtomsky. On this evidence alone, it would be hard to believe that U she N arzunoff was not Gurdjieff . If Gurdjieff had wanted to penetrate Tibet, he would"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"70 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE have had to go as a Buddhist, and to disguise himselfas a Kalmuck was the obvious choice . Stavropol , where Narzunoff 's passport was issued, is a town in the north of the Cauca sus, and it is as near Gurdjieff's home in the Caucasus proper as a Kalmuck might have been expected to come­ Astrakhan would have been a more likely province to issue a passport to a Kalmuck . Narzunoff was exactly the right age, and his birthday in 1874 even falls directly between the two dates most favored for Gurdjieff -18 72 and 1877. He was the right build and height; and if it is thought that the Indian police's description of his \"Mongolian\" fe atures puts him out of court, it should be emphasized that they later changed their minds about his Mongolian nationality, and that both Ouspensky in 1915 and Carl Bech­ hofer Roberts in 1919 remarked on Gurd jieff's \"oriental\" appearan ce. These consider ation s are important, because the latest photograph of Ushe Narzunoff was taken in 1908, and almost a decade separates it from the first known photograph of Gurdjieff in his role as teacher. In ten years a man can change greatly, irrespective of any consideration s of fraud. Some features-in particular the size of the feet and the long, sensitive fingers­ are very Gurd jieffian; others, inclu d ing the more fleshy appearance of the whole head in some of the photogra phs, seem to rule out the identification altogeth er. The photogra phs, however, are so disparate as to suggest either that their subject was a master of disguise or that some very funny business was going on. The first photograph of Narzunoff published by Joseph Deniker was supposedly taken in 1898. This is a formal portrai t, showing a young man with a rosary or chaplet in one hand and the other holding a book on a table. Even in the badly defined face Gurd jieff's most J)rominent characte ristics can be seen: the protruding chin, the distinc tivci'y shaped-and undisguisa­ bIe---ears, the small flat triangular patch at the bridge of the nos�. It is fairly clear that this picture has been doctored. The real depth of the eye sockets-note the shadow above the right eye-may have been disguised by highlighting the eyelids to produce a more \"Mong olian \" effect. The hair is quite obviously painted in. No human being of whatever nationality ever had hair which could lie in the way Narzunoff's hair is supposed to lie in the photogra ph. Two strokes of a paint brush would produce a similar effect. The reason for this tampering? Perhaps a shaven head, indicating that Narzunoff had already impersonated a Mongolian lama, or Gurd jieff's own naturally curly hair which was totally un-M ongolian . Further photographs were published by Joseph Deniker in Le Tour du Monde. A small portrait with a shaven head shows ears and brow ridge appro ximating Gurd jieff's, but it is quite unlike another portrait of Narzunoff in Chinese dress, said to have been taken in Peking. Either Narzunoff was trying to look \"Chinese\" or this is a picture of a different"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE GREAT GAME 71 person. It may be that this is further evidence of shiftine ss on Narzunoff 's part, as Deniker preserv ed, but did not publ ish, another photograph of his friend in the same Chinese costume which he identified specifically as having been taken in St. Petersburg. Neither in these \"Chinese\" pictures nor in another published in the Century Magazine (and supposed to show Narzunoff and his guides in the Hima layas) is there any possibility of making out Gurd jieff's face in that of the man said to be Narzunoff. On the other hand, it cannot be said fo r certain that these Oriental pictures show the same man as appears in the full-length portrait or the small portrait with the shaven head . The suspicion begins to germinate that perhaps this embarras sment of portrait studies was designed purposely in order to confuse . This impression is not dispelled by a collection of portraits of himse lf, his wife, and his children sent by Narzunoff to Deniker and never publish ed. There is one of his eldest son, Daidan or Datsun, dressed in a sailor suit and holding a chap let, said to have been taken in Moscow in 1904. Another shows Daidan, aged twelve, his younger brother Dord je, aged eight, and their lama \"educator\" in Verknie -Udinsk by Lake Baikal . It is undat ed, but might be a year or so earlier than the photograph of the elder son taken in 1904. On the back of the Verk nie-Udinsk photograph, Narzunoff scribbled a petition to Deniker to be \"as good a friend\" to his children as he had been to himsel f. In view of Deniker's earlier role as the editor of Narzu noff's misleading memoirs, it might not be over cynical to read a double meaning into this reque st. On the other hand, it might be the polite gesture of thanks which it appears to be. Additional difficulties are presented by a photograph of Narzunoff and his \"1fe taken in Ver knie-Udinsk on November 6, 1908. Narzunoff has larger and more cosmopolitan must ache than in his earlier photogra phs, and a physiognomy considerably different from the Asiatic type of the lady beside him. At first sight there is little in the face to suggest Gurd ji eff, although it is possible to point to a number of resemblances to Gurd jieff's fa ce in later life. There are the strong lines etched from the comers of the nose to the mouth, the beginnings of the dimple ' which was to mark Gurd jieff's chin , and-m ost telling of all-the eyes. First, they are not Mongolian eyes which conceal the tear-duct under the skin at the comer; and second, they ,show the squint in the left eye which becomes increasingly obvious in Gurd jieff's later photograph s. The direct studio lighting might have been arranged to Batten out Narzu noff's fa ce, and a bone structure sim ilar to Gurd jieff's can be detected by a study of the shadow contours along the nose and around the top of the eyes. On the other hand, the general appearance of the fa ce is not that of Gur djieff-nor of the \"Na rzunoff \" of the shav en-headed portrait or the figure with the rosary. This Narzunoff"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"72 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE does seem to resemble the pictures of the \"Narzunoff\" in Chinese dress. Is this evidence of a sim ilarly effective disguise, or were two or more men photographed in the Narzunoff identity? We do not possess the photograph which would settle the matt er. This is the portrait which Narzunoff gave the lama Yarphel at Ghoom in 1900, and which presumably showed him as he was, with no possibility of decepti on. However, the Graphic photograph of the Dord jieff mission is almost as good , because the Deputy Comm issioner of Police at Dar jeeling was able to identify Narzunoff as one of the party by comparison with the Yarphel photograph in his possession. This is the only photograph of Narzunoff taken without the benefit of studio conditions and the cosmetic acce ssories of the photographer's art. It is the only photograph which does not emanate from Narzunoff himself, through Deniker. It is the only photograph which can be said with reasonable certainty to show the historical Narzunoff who was in trouble in British India in 1900. And of all the photographs it is the one which most resembles Gurdjieff. In Meetings with Remarkable Men Gurd jieff describes how he and \"Pogossian\" disguised themselves as \"Caucasian Tarta rs,\" and in another place how he and \"Sk ridlov \" spent an extensive period of preparation fo r an atte mpt to impers onate a Persian dervish and a Say yid. These explicit admissions that Gurd jieff had adopted exotic disguises must be coupled with his enthusiasm fo r the trick of the actor's trade. Disguises are to be expected from Gurdj ieff; but some of the photographs of Narzunoff do seem to exceed all acceptable limits of the idea of disguise. The theory that some of the photographs were planted and others doctored to cover the tracks of a leading Tsarist agent is more likely . But such an argu ment is open to the powerful critici sm that it can be used to explain away as concocted any inconvenient item of evidence . It must be admitted that if this theory were held dogmaticall y, it would be extre mely dangero us. However, the same reasons which made it necessary to examine the possibility that Gurd jieff was Narzunoff also mean that the idea of deliberate falsification must be kept seriously in mind. We need not accept it, but we are compelled not to dismiss it out of hand . Although further comparison between Gurd jieff and Narzunoff must be cate gorized as suggestive speculation only, a nt1tnber of other points of contact should not be ignored . For exam ple, there are the apparently troublesome photographs fr om Verkn ie-Udinsk, showing the wife, the lama \"edu cator,\" and the boys Daidan and Dord je. Gurd jieff's Beelzebub has two sons called Tooilan and Tooloof, whose \"educator\" is mentioned with special affection. Acco rding to J. G. Bennett, Gurd jieff later clai med that his eldest son became the abbot of a Buddhist monastery at a precociously early age , so that it is quite natural to find the twelve-year-old Daidan already wearing the robes of a novice monk."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE GREAT GAME 73 It is significant that the younger child is called Dord je. In Tibetan Buddhism, the dordje is the symbol of the lightning, of power flowing from heaven to earth, and thus of the fully realized man, the agent of heaven. The expression also has a ritual significance , and the dordje itself is often referred to as the \"lamaic sceptre \": a metal object gripped in the fist, with the projecting ends becoming first bulbous, then tapering to a point. This is the concrete symbol of power descending from heaven, and is also said to be the symbol of meth od. A story told by Maurice Nicoll, one of Gurd jieff's leading fo llowers, relates that once, in a New York hotel, when Gurdjieff thought he was quite alone, he was overheard repeating to hims elf: \"I am dordje . . . I am dordje . . .\" Presumably he meant to affirm his function as the lightning flash between heaven and earth, and the incident is one small piece of evidence among many which demon strate Gurd jieff's debt to Tibetan Buddhism. This indebtedness is clear from Beelzebub's Tales; and it may well be the greate st single debt Gurd jieff owed to any existing system. If the young seeker fo r truth had become interested in Buddhism in his native Cauca sus, the nearest large communities of Buddhists would have been the Russian Kalmucks . It is not beyond the bounds of belief that his investigations led him across the path of Agwan Dord jieff and Prince Ukhtomsky. If Gurdjieff had wanted to study Tibetan Buddhism at the source, he could have had no better tutor than Dordj ieff, a Tsanit Khanpo at the right hand of the Dalai Lama. Prince Esper Ukhtomsky, with a personal and long-standing commitment to Buddhist pract ice, and his belief in the \"necessity\" of a brotherhood of seekers for the truth, would also have been able to further the young man's quest. Ukhtomsky is the most likely original of the charact er \"Prince Lu bovedsky\" in Meetings with Remarkable Men . Like that prince, Ukhtomsky had occult and Oriental interests; and when \"U she Narzunoff' was searched in India, he had a letter of introdu ction from Ukhtomsky in his pocke t. It was never really possible to consider Gurd jieff an adventurer pure and simp le, and as \"Ushe Narzun off, \" he is even more difficult to discount as a fraud. Clearly he was engaged in work on behalf of Russian Intelligence , and even received a medal for it if the Graphic's picture of the Dord jieff Mission is any guide. But this in no way excludes a more earnest side to his . career. The imperialism of Ukhtomsky and Badmaieff was of a distinctly mystical nature, and who is to say where Gurd jieff' s intelligence activ ities stopped and his spiritual quest began ? Stories which he told during the 1930s hint that for a time he became the Buddhist monk which his shaven head perpetually sugg ested. The evidence implies that with Dord jieff as his spiritual director , Gurd jieff combined politics with his personal search . To see him as a Russian Kim might not be far from the truth-and Kim also had his lama."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"·· ··· ···· F i rs t Jou rn ey \"-\"-\"-Second Jo urney ------Third Journey RUS SIA N t.

According to extracts from the Third Series quoted by J. G. Bennett, it was in Tibet that he was accidentally wounded for the second time. This happened in 1902, and Gurdjieff was taken by friends to convalesce at the edge of the Gobi Desert near Yangi Hissar. We know little about his movements for the next two years. Like the Buryat agent Tserempil, he might have joined the party of Dordjieff and the Dalai Lama as they withdrew northward into the Gobi. Certainly, by the end of 1904-about the time when the \"Collection G . . .\" went on sale in Paris­ Gurdjieff was back in the Caucasus, where he had his contretemps with the third stray bullet. On this occasion the disaster took place at Chiatur, on the southern slopes of the Caucasus between Tiflis and the Black Sea. When he had recovered, Gurdjieff wandered back through the Transcaspian toward Central Asia and returned to the place near Yangi Hissar to which he had been brought two years before. Apparently it was here, on the southeastern fringes of the desert, that he reached his conclusions about the important role played by hypnotism in human affairs. This train of thought was directly associated with the turbulent nature of his career to date. Bennett suggests that the skirmish in which Gurdjieff was hit for the third time was connected with the social unrest which culminated in the abortive Russian revolution of 1905. He 75"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"76 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE argues that Gurdjieff had penetrated the revolutionary. movement on behalf of the authorit ies, and was possibly even acting as a double agent. Although he may have spied fo r the Tsarist Government, Gurd jieH\" s political sympathies were later known to be at the opposite end of the spectrum to those of his more aristocratic Russian pupils, and the boy from the deprived backgro und could have played the part of a social revolutionary with some convicti on. But by Gurd jieff's own account, the chief result of his close acquaintance with political intrigue was to surfeit him with rhetoric and fill him with horror at the ease with which ordinary people allowed themselves to be led by the nose. Partl y in reaction against the violence he had seen and partly as a result of conversations with \"various revolutio nists\" he had met in Italy, Switzerland, and the Cauca sus, Gurd jieff decided that he \"must discover, at all costs, some manner or means for destroying in people the predilection fo r suggestibility which causes them to fall easily under the influence of 'mass- hypnosis .'\" Hypnotism had come increasingly to occupy the forefront of his thoug hts. His quest fo r meaning had halted before the blank conclusion that no existing knowledge could help him. The sole remaining possibility was the discovery of something new, not in the sense of \"lost wisd om,\" but new fa cts about the nature of man, resulting fr om a pioneering analysis of the psyche. He decided that \"the answers fo r which I was looking ... can only be found, if they are at all accessible to man, in the sphere of 'man's subconsc ious-me ntation .'\" In search of a key to the subconscious mind, he began to collect all the data he could on Asiatic theories of hypnot ism. In Bennett's view, this reorientation was the result of an important change in Gurd jieff's psychological attitu de. No longer was he seeking knowle dge or power for hims elf, but he was propo sing to liberate humanity fr om the illusions under which it labore d. This is true so far as it goes, and perhap s Gurd jieff' s decision does represent a newf ound altru ism. But his conc lusions bore the same relation to his search for wisdom as the chicken to the egg. They also- given Gurd jieff' s unusual tenacity- represented the only possible outcome. In Herald of Coming Good there is a skeleton chronology which covers the half-dozen years following 1904; but the wording is so ambiguous that little can be made of it, and the whole sequence of events may well be spurious. Gurdjieff claims that for two years he stayed in a Central Asian monastery, occupied in a theoretical study of hypnoti sm. He then decided to carry his investigations into the sphere of practical experiment. \"I began to give myself out to be a 'healer' of all kinds of vices and to apply the results of my theoretical studies to them , affording them at the same time real re lief.\" For the next few years he was experimenting with actual purpose in order to explain the psychological quest i ons which interested"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE PROFESSI ONAL HYPNOTIST 77 him personally, and to discover a satisf actory way of freeing people from their liability to suggestion . The experimental nature of his activ ities created certain moral prob lems, and in Herald of Coming Good Gurd jieff was concerned to justify hims elf: To make use of people , who display a special interest in an Institute fo unded by me, fo r purely personal ends would surely strike those around me as a manif estation of \"egotis m,\" but at the same time the people, who had anything to do with such an Institute ... could in this way alone, profit by the result of knowledge amassed by me due to exceptional circumstances of my life and which had regard to nearly all the aspects of reality and objective truth, and thus use them fo r their own benef it. If the idea of establishing an Institute had crossed Gurd jieff's mind by the late 1900 s, that prospect must have been distant. For the moment he confined himself to observation and exper iment. The passage in Beelzebub's Tales which describes his activities as a \"healer\" is one of those in which the character Beelzebub represents Gurdjieff him self. He beca me, says Gurd­ ji eff, a \"prof essional hypnotist\" in the towns of Chinese Turkest an. Turkestan is the area which extends roughly fr om the Aral Sea eastward into China. East or Chinese Turkestan corresponds to the present-day Chinese province of Sinkiang, which separates Mongolia fr om Tibet. At the west ernmost end lies the city of Kashgar, and the central area is occupied entirely by the desert of the Takla -Makan. To the south are the Hima layas and north of the desert, the Mong olian Altai . It is even now a very isolated part. of the world, with the few communities pinned to river valleys and oases. It was even more isolated when Gurdjieff lived there . In 1905 the Amer ican traveler, Oscar Terry Crosby, fo und only \"half a dozen Russian telegraph engineers, two small garrisons in Russian Turkestan , one small garrison in Chinese Turkestan ,\" in the 200 miles between Osh and Kashgar . In fact, Gurd jieff simply used the area as a base. In Beelzebub's wor ds, he \"also travelled a good deal, visiting almost all the continents, and during these trav els I encountered beings of most, as they say, 'peoples .' During these trav els of mine I remained nowhere fo r long excepting in certain independent countries on the Continent Asia called 'China: 'India: 'Tibet' and, of course, also that lately large st half -Asiatic, half -Eur opean com­ munity called 'Russi a. ''' J. G. Bennett's friend, the Turkish Prince Sabah eddin, told him that he had met Gurd jieff in 1908 when he was returning from Europe to Asia. It is quite possible that Gurd jieff visited America as well as Europe, and no doubt he kept up his contacts with Agwan Dordjieff, Shamz aran Badm aieff, and Esper Ukhtomsky. The"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"78 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE photograph of \"Us he Narzunoff' and his Chinese wife was taken by a photographer named Kosarev in Verkn ie-Udi nsk-Dord jieff's Mongolian headquarters and the chief Russian garrison town fo r the area-on November 6, 1908. If Gurd jieff's travels were as Beelzebub describes them-in India, Tibet, and China -it is possible that he continued to work fo r the Tsarist Intelligence Service . In \"The Material Question\" he repre sents himself as a businessman specializing in the antique trade, but able to turn his hand to a multitude of other projects. I engaged in the most varied enterpr ises, sometimes very big ones. For instance : I carried out private and government contracts fo r the supply and construction of railways and roads; I opened a number of stor es, restaurants and cinemas and sold them when I got them going well. I organ ised various rural enterprises and the driving of cattle into Russia from several countrie s, chiefly from Kashgar; I participated in oil-wells and fisheri es; and sometimes I carried on several of these enterpri ses simultaneously. Gurdj ieff always refers with the greate st affection to Turkestan, \"con­ cerning which place there are and will be preserved in my common presence the data then fixed fo r pleasant memories .\" Perhaps his pleasant memories were of fa mily life with the lady of the photogra ph. Whether or not he still acted as a secret agent, his gov ernment connections cannot have hindered his business activities-which would have harmonized nicely with Badmaieff 's economic war- although those to which he refers in \"The Material Question\" are said to have taken place as a concentrated effort to raise a large sum of money before he left fo r Moscow. For once, he was probably in easy circu mstanc es, and able to devote time to his occupation as a \"physician-hypnot ist. \" Like some of his Eur opean contemporari es-Freud and Jung among them-he was trying to use hypnosis to break through man's \"normal waking consciou sness\" to the subconscious mind, \"which ought in my opinion ,\" Gurdj ieff wrote , \"to be the real human consciousn ess.\" He saw the appal ling situation of humanity as caused by the division of human conscio usness into waking consciousness and subconscio usness. Human beings, thought Gurdjieff, had largely lost the capacity fo r faith, hope, and love, but buried in their subconscious was what he called \"Objective­ Conscience .\" This was fo r Gurd jieff the chara cteristic which alone dis­ tinguished man from lower creatu res. To Ouspensky he explained that the idea of \"conscience\" was equivalent in the realm of the emotions to the idea of conscio usness in that of thought. \"Conscienc e is a state in which a man"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE PROFE SSIONAL HYPNO TIST 79 feels all at once everything that he in general fe els or can fe el.\" It became the basic aim of Gurd jieff's Method to prod this conscience into operati on. If a man whose entire inner world is composed of contradictions were suddenly to fe el all these contradictions simultaneously within him self, ifhe were to fe el all at once that he loves everything he hates and hates everything he loves; that he lies when he tells the truth and that he tells the truth when he lies; and if he could fe el the horror of it all, this would be the state which is called \"conscienc e.\" Man, Gurd jieff taught, has developed mechan isms called \"buff ers\" to prevent his ever entering such an intolerable state of contradic tions . They keep him in the state of \"normal waking consci ousness\" and suppress conscience altogether. In Gurd jieff's view, the normal waking conscio usness operates under continuous hypnotic influence , noticeable only in particularly intensified cases. Man is almost always asleep . This is because in adolescence, when his conscio usness divides into two-and the \"real\" part of this consciousness becomes the subconscious-the human being is subject to great pressure from his parents and teachers to adopt the state of consciousness \"normal\" fo r man; that is, to fall asleep . At the same time, so Gurd jieff declar ed, an alteration in the blood circulation results in a new tempo of circulation developing fo r the normal waking consciousness as well as that which corresponds to the functioning of the subconscious or real consci ousness. He claimed to have invented a new method of hypnosi s-an advance on the method by which the subject is hypnotized by staring at a bright object­ wbich .con sisted in altering the tempo of the blood circulation \"by means of a certain hindering of the movement of the blood in certain blood vessels .\" The result was that although the circulation continued at the normal mechanical tempo, he could evoke the properties of the buried sub­ conscious as well. Only the story of Gurd jieff's relati ons with his pupils can explain what his new form of hypn osis in fact was, or how he went about breaking down man's normal waking consci ousness and encouraging the growth of con­ science instead . As fo r the circulation of the blood, his unco mpromising materiali sm naturally extended to explanations of hypno sis. He approved wholeheartedly of Mesmer and the early theorists of animal magnetis m, and poured scorn on James Braid. Charcot, and other specialists who denied the material basis of hypnotic phenomena. Medically speaking, this may be ridic ulous, but Gurdjieff never claimed to be an orthodox doctor. According to Beelzebub, he chose to adopt the disguise of a \"healer\" in order to further his psychological researc hes. He had observed that people"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"80 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE speak frankly only to doctors and priests, and he had no desire to restrict his liberty by impersonating a holy man. Although he joined the medical profession in a spirit of experiment, he acquired considerable skill at his new calling. In Chinese Turkestan the chief disabilities which came within his province were opium addiction and the chewing of hashish. When, in about 1910-1 1, he transferred his activities to Russian Turkestan, he concentrated on the equivalent Russian vice: addiction to vodka. \"This maleficent means,\" explains the sagacious Beelzebub to his grandso n, \"is obtained there chiefly from the surplanetary formation they call the 'potato. \", Gurdjieff's skill as a hypnotist was to stand him in good stead when he was forced to earn money in the West; and it was probably in Turkestan that he acquired his knowledge of the effect of drugs on human beings. His later use of alcohol is well known, and the nature and composition of opium remained one of his interests up to the time when he was writing Beelzebub's Tales . Western medicine was for Gurdjieff an object of contempt. He afterward identified only three useful drugs from the whole pharmacopoeia -opium, castor oil, and a substance obtained from a certain tree. There are several reasons for linking Badmaieff with Gurdjieff's activities as a \"physici an-hypnot ist.\" For someone interested in non-European medicine, the Badmaieff dispensary would have been a natural port of call in St. Petersburg, particularly if that someone were associated with Dordjieff. In Meetings with Remarkable Men, Gurdjieff introduces his friend \"Soloviev\" as a patient whom he cures of alcoholism in Central Asia. Soloviev was \"an authority on what is called eastern medicine in general, and on Tibetan medicine in particular, and he was also the world's greatest specialist in the knowledge of the action of opium and hashish on the psyche and organism of man.\" He probably never existed, but the list of his specialities is significant: \"Eastern and Tibetan medicine, opium and hashish.\" As far as is known, Shamzaran Badmaieff was the greatest expert on such subjects in the Western world. Badmaieff had consolidated his position at the Russian court with a prescription which cured the Tsar's stomach complaint-this was said to be a mixture of henbane and hashish. The ill will stimulated by his privileged position gave rise to an absurd legend that he, Rasputin, and the Tsaritsa's confidante, Anna Virubova, were trying to poison the Tsarevitch with \"a yellow powder. \" A memorandum of Badmaieff's survives, dated October 9, 1912, which recommends treatment for the sick child. \"Europe has no treatment against internal or external blows,\" he wrote, \"except ice, iodine, and massage. . . . If you succeed in persuading them to try my medicine, please ask them to give no other medicine, either internally or externally, this includes ice.

There were \"boiled Dabsen­ Tan, agai nst knoc ks,\" a stomach medicine fo r constipati on, and a prepara­ tion called \"Gabir-Nirnga, \" a specific agai nst high fe ver. Badmaieff was theref ore still closely in touch with the court about the time that Gurd jieff returned to Russia, and it is likely that Gurd jieff was in contact with him throughout his care er as a hypnotizing docto r. Gurdjieff describes a visit which Beelzebub pays to Russia in his capacity as a \"physician-hyp notist, \" which is supposed to hav e taken place well before the First World War. The incentive is given by an elderly Russian, who invites him to St. Petersburg to help in the unending war against alcohol ism. The Rus sian explains that he is the head of a fo undation to combat the proble m, and hopes that the specialist Beelzebub will join, to help consolidate the organizati on. Beelzebub accepts the invitation. One of his motives is that he has already decided \"to set up in one or another of their great inhabited spots a 'somet hing' of the kind they call there a 'chemical laboratory\"'-with Gurdjieff, \"chemistry\" always meant his special brand of alchemistry-\"in which I intended , by means pre­ viously decided beforehand to proceed with special experiments on several deeply concealed aspects of their ever the same strange psyche .\" This is very much what he said in plainer language in Herald of Coming Good . Making allowances for the fact that Gurdjieff may here be fu sing two or more visits to . the Russian capital to provide background fo r Beelzebub's caustic remarks about the fo lly of Russians and of humanity in general, his story is not unbelieva ble. Beelzebub travels to St. Petersburg with the elderly Russian but finds himself left much to his own devic es. He decides to use his free time to try to secure a permit fo r his proj ected \"laboratory ,\" but becomes lost in the impenetrable jungle of Russian bureauc racy . Eventually, Beelzebub balks at undergoing an examination by a doctor­ which would, of course, reveal his tail. This is a stock metaphor in Gurdjieff fo r a tricky situation in which he would be fo rced to reveal his real purposes unwillingly . Beelzebub accordingly abandons his \"foolish hustlings around .\" During his stay in St. Petersburg he has also been giving his elderly acquaintance various suggestions on running the fo undati on. At first these are accepted and put into practice , but when the news leaks that Beelzebub is the source of such proposals- \"some fo reign doctor or other, not even a European\" -a serious dispute arises. Without a laboratory of his own , and unable to use the fo undation fo r his experiments \"on the psyche of the terrestrial beings en mass e,\" Beelzebub decides to go elsew here. However, news of his work on alco holism reaches the Tsa r, and Beelzebub is first subjected to a long ceretnonial presentation which leaves him quite blank as to what the Tsar even looked like .

Pavlov's colleag ue, v. M. Bekhterev (1857-1927) had long been interested in using hypnotic techniques fo r this very purp ose, and in 1912-- 13 he published a number of pamphlets on the problems of alcohol ism. Acco rding to Bennett, Gurd jieff later told his pup ils that he had met Nicholas II several times and had been \"in direct contact with Rasputin .\" Neither of these clai ms is improba ble, if he had had the p atronage of Badmaie ff; and their likelihood is reinforced by the fa ct that Gurd jieff had now decided to extend his acti vities into the world of the occult. In Herald of Coming Good he explains the reasoning behind this change of direction . He had convinced himself that the solution to the problems which interested him must be sought in the conditions of man's waking consciou sness as well as in the subconscious mind. In other wor ds, he wanted to study the mecha nisms which kept humanity in a state of slee p. The result was a decision to appoint himself a \"prof essor-instructor\" of the so-called occult scienc es. Gurd jieff had without doubt become fa miliar with most aspects­ including the trickery-of supposedly supernatural phenomena. In Beelzebub's Tales he ref ers to a time when he had been a \"prof essional Indian Fak ir,\" and in Meetings with Remarkable Men, the character \"Ekim Bey,\" whose life \"was arranged down to the smallest detail like my own,\" stands partly as a personification of Gurd jieff as the \"great maestro of the supernatural .\" Accord ing to Herald of Coming Good, Gurd jieff worked fo r over two years in his role as occultist -and again he was exper imenting. DUring the \"so-c alled ' manipula tions' in the realm of the beyond\" which he demonstr ated to members of one occult society, he writ es, \"I began to observe and study various manif estations in the waking state of the psyche of these trained and fr eely moving Guinea-Pigs, allotted to me by Destiny fo r my experiments .... \" He realized th at Europe was suffering from an epidemic of occulti sm. As he put it: \"At that time there was among men a widely prevalent and specific psychosis which, as has been long esta blished, attai ns periodically a high degree and is manif ested by people giving themselves up to various 'woeful' ideas in those sphere s of quasi-human knowledge ... which today are called 'occult ism,' 'theosop hism ,' 'spiritua lism ,' etc.\" Gurd jieff had read widely in the literature of such cults , and he knew the language of contemporary occu ltism like the back of his hand . When he discovered that his ideas were particularly attractive to \"such people as were already in the highest degree 'possessed' of the before -mentioned 'specific-psych osis, ''' he altered his tactics accord ingly.

Popular churc hmen, like Father John of Kronstadt, attracted the huge followings associated with Indian gurus. Saintly hermits like Ambrose of the Optina monastery played conf essor to an endless chain of pilgr ims. At court the influence of Orthodox holy men had been replaced, first by that of the French occ ultists \"Papus\" (Dr. Gerard En cau sse) and his spiritual master \"Mo nsieur Philippe ,\" then by the predominance of Rasputin . In polite society spiritualism and legend were interminable topics of conversation . The intelligentsia pounced eagerly on Theosophical and occult literature imported from the West, conf ounded it with philosophy and a dash of ae sth eti cs, and created an intoxicating potpourri of intellectual superstiti ons. The hysterical atmosphere was intensified by anxiety generated by social discontent. On the outbreak of the 1917 Revoluti on, the skoptsy , a bizarre cult of self -castra tors , are thought to have numbered one hundred thousand. There is little more telling evidence of the way the wind blew. Gurd jieff appeared as a man of mystery in an atmosphere of mystery. Although he inevitably came into contact with occultists of many descrip­ tions, he remained invisible . His orig ins, his ideas, and his motives were hidden in the deepest dou bt. In Herald of Coming Good Gurdji eff describes how he at first contented himself with establishing an ascendency over several existing occult societie s. However, he expla ins, he was unable to find a large enough selection of human types fo r his ps ychological obser vatio ns, and so established occult groups of his own \"in three diff erent cities .\" Still he failed to attract a sufficiently broad cross section of humanity. He ther ef ore realized all his assets with a view to fo unding an organization of his own , and moved to Russia. In Herald of Coming Good he dates his arrival in 191 1, and in various prospect uses issued to ad vertise his Institute fo r the Harmonious Development of Man, states that his first Russian headquarters was Ta shkent. In the strange docu ment known as Glimpses of Troth, written at his instigation in the winter of 1914, Gurdjieff is said to have come to Russia \"two or three years ago\" and at first to have lived in st. Petersburg (in an alternative unpublished translati on, the time span is extended to three or fo ur year s). The approximate date of his move was theref ore 1910--11, and this is suggestive, both because it coincides with Dord jieff's plan fo r a St. Petersburg temple, and because these years were a time of great crisis in the affai rs of Tibet. In 1910 the Chinese invaded the coun try and the Dalai Lama fled to the protection of the British in India.

In June 1912, Dordj ieff himself applied to the British agent in Tibet fo r permission to travel to Russia through India, and when this was denied, had to make his way circumspectly through Mongolia. This journey was probably to announce the fo rmal secession of Tibet from China which Dord jieff reported next year to St. Petersburg and Paris. * It is difficult not to link Gurd jieff's abrupt transition to Mu scovy with the Tibetan policy of Dord jieff and Badmaieff. His withdra wal to Tashkent­ from Chinese territory to Russian Turkestan-c oincides with the invasion of Tibet. In Glimpses of Troth his initial stay in St. Petersburg is said to have lasted from 1910-11 to 1914, during which period he devoted \"his eff orts and his knowledge to some work of his ow n.\" This \"work of his own\" may have been connected less with Gurd jieff's unf atho mable \"work on himself' than with Tibetan diplomacy . It is possibly significant that acco rding to Glimpses of Troth, Gurdjieff moved to Moscow in 1914, by which time events in Western Europe had begun to outweigh in diplomatic importance those in Cent ral Asia. One acco unt, which seems to describe Gurd jieff -on a mysterious errand, acco mpanied by a \"slant-eyed\" fr iend-in St. Petersburg dUring the winter and early spring of 191�14, is contained in the autobiography of Sir Paul Dukes (1889-1967). Dukes received his knighthood fo r intelligence work in Russia after the Revolution, and later became a regular dining companion of Ouspensky; Bef ore the outbreak of the First World War, Dukes was a music student at the St. Petersburg Conser vat oire, where the pianist Anna Ess ipova introduced him to the works of H. P. Blavats ky. He continued his education in occult matters through Spiritualist seances organized by Sidney Gibbes, the English tutor to the Imperial fa mily.

He was supposed to have been brought back to life by a Siberian shaman who sent him into the world with a healing mission. Through Lev Levovitch, Dukes met the man who he called \"Prince Ozay.\" The resemblance between Gurdjieff and Ozay is marked, and that between the picture of Gurdjieff given by Glimpses of Truth and Dukes's own account of his meeting even more so. Paul Dukes spent the summer of 1913 on an estate in Tula, where he decided to practice hypnotism on the villag ers. On his return to St. Petersburg, he got in touch with Lev Levovitch, with whom he discussed his experim ents. Levovitch approved and took him to see the man he called Prince Ozay in a house at the bottom of a small street \"not far from the Nicolas station .\" The manner of their arrival was unusual. They first entered \"a very plain apartment\" but passed through this to another adjoining apartment, which was \"larger and more sumptuous. There was a marked Oriental touch in its decorat ions. The walls of the hall were adorned with carpets, wrought-iron lamps with colou red glass hung from the ceiling .... The room, fairly large , was draped with curtains and other hangings , with lamps to match .\" The \"Oriental\" room matches the description given by Ouspensky of Gurd jieff's room in Moscow; it also matches the description of the dacha near Moscow given by the authors of Glimpses of Truth . The lamps, when compared with the glittering decorations made by Gurd jieff for his flat in Par is, are suggestive . And the circumspect entrance through a virtually empty apartm ent hints at a possible connection with the melodramatic trappings of the Great Game. Ozay's appearance is similar to that of Gurd jieff as he is described in Glimpses of Truth . In both cases, the stranger discovers a man sitting cross­ legged on a low divan with coffee beside him on a table. The Gurd jieff of Glimpses of Truth is alone and smoking a nargil eh, while the Ozay of Paul Dukes is playing chess with a man with slanting eyes. Ozay is \"wearing a patterned silk dressing-gown and a turban\" and is \"dark , thickset, with a short, bushy black beard.\" Later Dukes sees that he is \"about medium height, sturdily built.\" Gurd jieff wore a beard fo r some time in the 1930s . Dukes's first encounter with Ozay has the tone of Gurd jieff's jocularity . He is invited to sit down and play chess with his host. \"Take off your shoes if you would be more comf ortable,\" said my host. I did so, and was ashamed to find I had a hole in my sock. I tried to hide it when I doubled my feet under me, but to my embarras sment he pointed at it, smiled, and said: \"You believe in ventilati on! Good thing- nothing like fresh air! ... Black or white?\" and he held out his closed hands with two pawns in them. When I had picked white I noticed that the other hand had held a white pawn too."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"86 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE There are other aspects of Ozay which remind the reader of Gurdjieff. He drinks his own powerful brew, and on \"a kind of guitar\" plays Dukes's \"plaintive oriental tunes, sometimes humming, sometimes singing softly in a rich barito ne.\" Dukes used to visit him at night-always accompanied by Lev Levovitch-and stay until three in the morning. Ozay had a stock of ribald stories and could rarely be induced to tell Dukes anything in a straightforward manner-he was \"provokingly evasive. \" His visitor had to probe and endure before Ozay could be induced to answer his questions. The two topics on which Dukes records Ozay's pronouncements were closely linked. The first concerned the nature of prayer and the meaning of the Christian Scriptures. For Ozay prayer-with which he coupled fasting-was a physiological exercise. Dukes had made use of the English Lord's Prayer as a \"magical\" charm to impress the simple Russian peasants: \"Very int-er-esting,\" remarked Ozay, and demonstrated how the English Lord's Prayer had been designed as a breathing exercise to be said uninterruptedly on a single bass note. You had to pay attent ion to the regul ation of the breath, to the words of the prayer, and to the sound, to derive the full benefit from the exercise. The function of prayer was to attune \"the body�r the soul, if you prefer that metaphor .\" \"You are a musical instrument, as a piano is,\" said Ozay, \"and you need to be kept in tune. That's where fasting and other exercises come in; you can't possibly reflect finer vibrations when your body�r soul if you prefer-is loaded with a lot of food gurgling in the stomach, or while the blood makes a din chasing about veins and arteri es.\" To Dukes this opened up new horizons, new visions of meaning to be found in the Christian Scriptures. The Bible became a book of personal instru ction, to be decoded, \"beginning first of all with the training of the physical body to become a fit temple of the spirit.\" Fasting and breath control were part of this \"esoteric Christianity\"-Dukes uses the same phrase as Gurdjieff -as was compulsory celibacy at certain stages of the training. \"But,\" Ozay warned, \"the fanatic who becomes a permanent celibate is like a musician who spends his life doing one exercise. \" God, is achieved not through activity but through cessation of activity. Cessation to the utmost limit of diet, breath and sex. These are the three pillars on which prayer is built. Each has to be trained and disciplined by restraint-there is no other way because they are all runaway horses. Only when the ground is cleated can true building com mence. Only from that point can you begin to act consciously . During the chaos of the Revolution, Paul Dukes lost touch with the myst erious Prince Ozay and never saw him again. Was he Gurdjieff? It"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE PROFESSI ONAL HYPNO TIST 87 seems difficult to believe that there were two such teachers in the same area at the same time. Ozay spoke En glish better than he spoke Russian , which in his mouth was markedly acce nted. To his slant-eyed friend, the Prince spoke a language Dukes could not identify . He clai med to have been \"in many churches in England and Americ a. \" Dukes \"had reason to think that my strange host was , nominally at least, a Moslem or a Parsee ,\" but he acquired very little definite inf ormation . Ozay was \"very learned and much travelled\" and Dukes knew nothing of his fo rmal prof ession, although he \"at one time suspected\" that the Prince was \"visiting the Russian capital on some religious errand .\" If we choose to regard Gurdjieff as resident in St. Petersburg at Easter 1913, this is confirmed by Glimpses of Truth . It is also significant that Ozay was associated with the prof essional hypnotist and healer Lev Levovitch, whose argu ment about chargi ng high fe es fo r his cures by suggestion was exactly that used by Gurd jieff to justify a high admission charge to his groups . People do not value something, he expl ained , unless they are made to pay fo r it. It is tempting to construct a chain of events linking Badmaieff, Paul Dukes, Lev Levovitch , Gurdji eff, and any other practitio ners of unorthodox medicine in St. Petersburg. Gurd jieff probably did move in the occult society of the capital , and through Badmaieff he may well have met Rasputin and the Tsar. But it is doubtful whether he had anything to do with the complex web of plot and counterplot which surrounded the Russian thron e. Such intrigues were not fo reign to his nature , but the vision of Gurd jieff as a Rasputin manque-the description was already in use when Carl Bechofer Roberts met him in Tiflis in 191 9- belongs to the sort of �ythologi zing which delights in seeing him as the occ ult advisor to the Tsar, the Dalai Lama, and Adolf Hitler. The name-calling might have nothing more behind it than the mere fa ct of Gurd jieff's presence in St. Petersburg dUring the Indian summer of the autocracy , with whose mystical interests he was associated. Acco rding to Glimpses of Truth Gurd jieff mo ved to Moscow in 1914 and took a country house nearby where he could work undisturb ed. The very existence of this house is said to have remained unknown to most of his associat es. \"Ma intaining in his work a certain rhythm understood only by himself, he sometimes leaves it and comes to town , and again returns to his work after a certain tim e.\" This house is the setting fo r the conversation recorded in Glimpses of Truth, a document which in its printed fo rm is some fo rty pages long. It purports to tell the story of its author's meeting with Gurdjieff; but acco rding to Ouspensky, the idea of the story belonged to Gurd jieff himself, and it was actually written by two members of Gurd jieff's Moscow group. Ouspensky remarks that the original version was \"evidently written by a man with no literary experience . \" He himself"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"88 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE edited and rewrote a copy which Gurd jieff gave him, and it seems probable that the published version of Glimpses of Truth is also the work of several hands. Ouspensky's translation is dated \"Moscow, December 1914.\" On the last page are the words \"end of first chapte r,\" but we should beware of assuming that it was actually intended to carry the story further. When Ouspensky first heard it read, he criticized it fo r lack of clarity-he had found it interesting, but exactly what was this doctrine which the story expou nded? He was immediately told by Gurd jieff's pupils that he had \"missed the most important part of it .\" The story begins with the imaginary narrato r's search for wisdom , which he sees as having been guided by an external providence whose workings appear coherent only to himsel f. The narrator discovers occu ltism and becomes immersed in it, until suddenly he loses his occult contacts . He embarks on a course of personal inves tigati on, and makes friends among people with similar interests. Eventually, his particularly close companion in this search seems to be growing away from him, and the narrator becomes angry at his apparent lack of friendliness. A point of crisis comes when the seeker finds in the paper a notice of a ballet calle d, \"The Struggle of the Magicia ns,\" written by one G. 1. Gurd jieff, \"an orientalist well known in Mosco w.\" He determines to run Gurd jieff to ground, but his faithless friend attempts to dissuade him. Eventually this friend, A., admits that he knows Gurdjieff and departs without promising anythin g, leaving the author of the story in a state of nervous expectat ion. Next day he is telephoned by A. and told curtly to be at a certain railway station at a certain time. He arrives early-A . arrives late , bearing two huge and mysterious trunks-and they entrain fo r the country house which Gurd jieff has taken for the winter. On the way the narrator learns that A. had discussed bringing him to Gurd jieff earlier, but was told that it was not yet time. The pair drive by sledge to the large two-story house where the Master awaits them; and they have to carry the heavy trunks. The actual introduction to Gurd jieff takes place in circumstances which suggest Freemasonic ritual : the two visitors enter a room in complete darkne ss, and only when A. sweeps aside a heavy tapestry does the figure of Gurd jieff appear, smoking his nargi leh, seated cross-legged on a divan in a brightly lit room. Gurd jieff's \"oriental origin\" is at once obvious, and his eyes immediately impress the new arrival- Unot so much the eyes themselves as the look with which he met me. It was a look given to one whom one has known long and well.\" The impact made by the man was intensified by that of the room in which he sat. \"There was no area not covered, either by carpets or hangings of some sort, \" writes the fictitious author. Carpets and tapestries cover the walls so as to obscure the windows and doors. The ceiling is hung with a mosaic of"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"TH E PROFESSI ONAL HYPNOTIST 89 colored shawls and from its center is suspended a brass lamp. A piano is piled with old embroidered silks so as to be scarcely recognizable; and the Dutch stove is similarly draped. A single carpet covers the floor and the seating is low and Oriental. Three collections of objects decorate the walls: one of strange musical instruments, another of Oriental weaponry, a third of carved pipes. In one corner is a particularly splendid combination of colored silks, in the middle of which hangs an icon of St. George; below the icon on a series of shelves stand several ivory stautettes. Those named are Christ, Buddha, Moses, and Mohammed. In this exotic setting a night-long conversation takes place between Gurdjieff and his visitor, with A. occasionally acting as an intermediary. \"He served,\" says the narrator, \"as a sort of transmitter between G. and myself.\" At the beginning of their talk, Gurdjieff speaks haltingly, in poor Russian, often turning to A. for the completion of a sentence or a thought. But as the conversation becomes increasingly rarefied, Gurdjieff is represented as relying on A. less and less. \"His speech flowed more freely and naturally, the necessary words seemed to come of themselves, and I could have sworn that by the end of the conversation, he was speaking the clearest, unaccented Russian .... \" In this contrived description of an imaginary meeting, much of Gurd­ jieff 's technique is already obvious. The difficulties created by A., the abruptness of the appointment, the heavy trunks-which may have contained priceless antiques, scientific instruments or lumps of stone-are all of a piece with Gurdji eff' s later tactics. The deliberate theatricality of the room in which the guest is received corresponds to that of Gurdji eff's Moscow apartment, where the unusual decoration helped to create the \"special atmosphere\" described by Ouspensky. Gurdjieff used often to �mploy a third party-s ometimes as a straightf orward interpreter-in his teaching conversations. This device served to familiarize his listeners with his ideas, as well as being a valuable exercise for the intermediary and a means of gauging the pitch of his discourse by watching how his \"transmitting station\" conveyed his meaning to an audience which he knew better than Gurdjieff himself . The gradual perfection of Gurdji eff 's Russian could mean one of several things, but it was a phenomenon also noticed by pupils who spoke French or English. The conversation which forms the body of the chapter contains little which does not appear in a more expanded form in Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous . Gurdjieff talks of the unity of all things descending into plurality; he describes the Law of Seven and the Law of Three on which his cosmo logy is based-and which will shortly be outlined; he analyzes the Ray of Creation which Ouspensky describes. But the fragmentary character of the description bears out Ouspenky's criticism: it is difficult to discover the real nature of the doctrine which the protagonists are discussing, and it"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"90 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE is certain that the story would not make sense if the reader were unfamiliar with the outline given in In Search of the Miraculous . From the clamor of GurdjieH\" s pupils it seems that this must have been deliberate . Glimpses of Truth was written for a particular purpose: to give glimpses only of the majestic building whose outlines the conversation had allowed the narrator to grasp. This may have been in order to encourage a reader to find out more for himself, or simply to tantalize him. Gurdjieff asked Ouspensky whether the story could be published in a newspaper, and in the tale itself, the narrator asks if the ideas he has heard cannot be made more widely known. Gurdjieff answers that the previous summer he and his friends decided to try to disseminate their ideas through the press, but that the outbreak of war prevented the attempt from being properly made. Glimpses of Truth, with its rubric \"end of first chapter,\" may therefore have been an abortive attempt to gain publicity for Gurdjieff's ideas. Alternative ly, it may simply have been a sketch which was intended for a particular use at a particular time. For it is quite clear that Gurdjieff-ever experimenting, perhaps balked in his attempts to establish his work under a \"scientific\" umbrella in St. Petersburg -was fishing. Glimpses of Truth is bait, and with the realization of this fact, many of Gurdjieff's later activities take on a new aspect; as of brightly colored floats dotting the surface of a murky river. Gurdjieff was trailing his coat. If he were \"Ozay,\" he discussed music with the young musician, Paul Dukes. He talked of \"the miraculous\" to Ouspensky. With others, he discussed dancing-or love. Many a hard­ headed \"dollar-holder\" heard from him the smirking remark of the greasy Levantine: \"I, too, am businessma n.\" Some of his later attacks on particular professions-doctors, writers, artist s--<:an be pinned down to the fact that he was surrounded by such people, and in order to lead them into the maze of his ideas, he had first to engage their interest by showing where the particular questions in which they were interested impinged on the view of the world which he designed that they approach for themselves. Once well in and engaged in the cosmic machine, their props were knocked from under them. They must then learn to swim in good earnest. In Glimpses of Truth Gurdjieff emphasizes that occ ultism is not necessary as a jumping-off point. It was a warning he repeated later to his pupils in Europe . But faced by his imaginary visitor, embarked on an occult quest, he began their talk with the formula from the Emerald Tablet of Hermes: \"As above, so below.\" \"At the same time I must say that there is no need to use occultism as the base from which to approach the understanding of tr uth,\" Gurdjieff is made to say. \"Truth speaks for itself in whatever form it is manifested. . . . Well, I repeat, I begin with the occult formula because I am speaking to you. \" During the discussion GurdjieH' applies his compli-"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE PROF ESSIONAL HYPNOTIST 91 cated cosmic laws to the principles of modem science. The narrator asks him whether an uneducated man could understand his ideas. Gurdjieff replies that an uneducated shepherd might acquire , in the course of one day's profound meditation, what it would take a scientist many years to disco ver. \"The material you refer to was quoted only because I spoke to you .... Forms may be very different. \" So they proved to be. Gurdjieff advises his questioner, when he asks about the occult idea of initiati on, to forget it altoget her. \"All your researches in this area were good exerc ises for your mind; therein lies their great value, but only there.\" Glimpses of Truth is surprisingly frank about Gurd jieff' s reasons for acting in what was often an incomprehensible way. It would have been open to any reader to put two and two together from the description of his remarkable room, with its \"delicate scent that mingled agreeably with an aroma of tobacco ,\" the riot of colored silk, and the hangings which so shut out the everyday world that the charac ter A. can remark, when he opens the curtains on broad daylight, \"As you can see, time does not exist here.\" All the cards are on the table , but not face up. It is the task of the reader or the listener to discover their denominations. One critic thinks that Glimpses of Truth gives a \"melodramatic picture of a sort of stage superma n,\" and there is undoubtedly something over­ produced about the Gurdjieff whom the story presents. If he really does possess such fundamental knowledge, the reader is inclined to ask, why all the obvious stage manag ement, why the cat and mouse tactics with the pathetically eager narrator? An important problem is raised by the rather dubious first impression which Gurd jieff made on many people who afterward became his devoted discip les. In Herald of Coming Good, Gurdjieff says that twenty-one years earlier -that is, in 1912--he took an oath to live fo r that period \"in some ways an artificial life, modelled upon a programme which had been previo usly planned in accordance with certain definite princip les.\" The \"artificial life\" had to do with a renunciation of the skill he had developed as a hypnot ist. In 1933 he spoke to the American author Jean Toomer of the oath he had take n. \"I tell you something secret,\" he said, \"only fo r yourself. Twenty-one years ago I vowed never to use hypnotism to effect my aims. Recent circumstances have made me struggle with myself to keep my vow ... I do not want to break it.\" The reasons he gives fo r embarking on this program in Herald of Coming Good are, first, that he recogn ized that he was what would now be called a charismatic figure; and second, that he wanted his pupils, at all costs , to display their personal initiative , which might be stifled if he employed his full personal magnetism and strength of chara t!ter. J. G. Bennet t connects this decision with the Sufi doctrine of"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"92 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE \"the path of Malamat\" or \"blame-tak ing,\" in which the aspirant to spiritual development acts in such a way as to attract to hims elf calumny and the ill opinion of his fellowm en. There is evidence that Gurd jieff' s artificial life was indeed governed by some such plan; although the idea can clearly be used to excuse every slip he made. The vaguely fraudul ent impressio n induced by Glimpses of Truth may therefore be one result of the tactics which Gurd jieff deliberately adopted in 1912. But to what end was such deviou sness directed? Gurdj ieff had been a seeker for esoteric knowl edge, a student of the unconscious mind, a \"physician-hypnot ist,\" a professional occultist- intermittently, a secret agent and dealer in Orientalia-and apparently by 1912, at the start of his \"teach ing\" proper, he was something else again. We may disbelieve in the story of his oath-it is always wise to be chary of accepting Gurd jieff' s every statement -but at first sight it is difficult to see what, if anything, he intended by his teaching. The narrator of Glimpses of Truth is given hints about the \"Great Knowledge\" which Gurd jieff possesses and is told that in a year's time he will understand more than is at present possible fo r him to know. Meanwhile, although he has the sensation of having lifted the outer veil of the mysteries, he has no idea at all of what the inner tabernacl es hold. What was the aim of Gurd jieff's teaching? asked one of his Russian pupils. Ouspensk y recorded the answer: \"I certainly have an aim of my own,\" said G., \"but you must permit me to keep silent about it. At the present moment my aim cannot have any meaning for you, because it is important that you should define your own aim. The teaching by itself cannot pursue any defi nite aim. It can only show the best way for men to attain whatever aims they may have.\" The men and women who came to Gurd jieff in Russia were desper ately uncerta in, scared of the future, plagued by myths and expectations of the mirac ulous. That is, they were as men and women have alway s been in every land and every generation-alt hough the place and the time generated particular problem s. Gurdjieff entered a his torical situation in which the normal hopes and fears of mankind were given an unnatural intensity, and his teaching was theref ore experienced by his Russian followers with particular vivid ness. When everyt hing seemed lost, Gurd­ jieff appeared as the guide and mentor: the Man Who Knows. They beheld the Great Magician .

One of his childhood fr iends was a cousin named Dmitri Me rkouroff , who by 1914 was a successful sculptor in Moscow.

One time ends and another begins . Death is reaUy a return to the beginning .\" Pyotr Dem ianovitch Ouspensky was born in Moscow on March 5, 1878, Old Style. His fa ther was an officer in the Survey Ser vice , and a talented spare-time mathematician whose particular hobby was the fa shionable topic of the fo urth dimension . Although Demian Ouspensky died when his son was quite young and all his writings were lost, he pas sed on his mathematical enthusias ms. The manner in which Pyotr Ouspensky was to apply such ideas had little to do with acade mic mathematics; and a mist ake made by the translators of his first book to appear in En glish has meant that he is still represented as a severe figure who escaped by ac cident fr om the established academies to fo und his own Stoa. Ouspensky was an artist rather than a scholar- potentially a good one, as is shown by his novel , Strange Life of Ivan Osokin-and he became instead a romantic philoso­ pher. He was very much a child of his time and pla ce. His parents had shared artistic interests : Ouspensky's mother was herself a painter and an amateur of French and Russian literatu re. Ouspensky grew up in the atmosphere of the Russian intelligentsia, and his earl iest memories were of his mother's par ents' house, which was a center of arti stic society . His maternal grandf ather was an artist who had turned from specializing in portraiture to painting fo r churc hes, a branch of art which in 94"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 95 Holy Russia had a peculiar importance and its own mystique. His grandf ather died in 1882, and his gran dmother became the chief influence on the young Ouspensky. She was clearly a remarkable and intelligent woman : Ouspensky would later recall the pleasure she had given him and his younger sister with her stories of old Moscow days. Her house on Pimenovskaya Street was fre quented by all sorts and classes of people. Ouspensky remarks that it was \"in many ways a very old -fas hioned house, and in other ways very much ahead of its time\"; it may not be reading too much into this to see the house as connected with the movement in Russian art which was resurrecting traditional styles and fo lk motifs so as to make them the essen ce of the contempor ary . The art of the icon played a leading part in this revival , and as a church painter Ouspensk y's gran dfat her may have been associated with the fas hion. Ouspensky's brief accounts of his early life are vivid and evocati ve. When his A New Model of the Universe was published in 1931, reviewers were qUick to note the excellence of the passages which described his own adventu res. But because of the nature of his work, Ouspensky must alway s seem to suff er at the hands of a biographer; fo r much of what he wrote or said on any topic was based on a rigoro us analysis of his own fa ilings. To criticize Ouspensky is often merely to echo his own self -criticism and to honor a sometimes enviable degree of self -knowledge . There is a particular difficulty in treating the stray personal ref erences in his writings as evidence of a docu ment ary sort. Ouspensky revised his early publications sever al times, and the screen of his late r psychological ideas­ wh ether those he learned fr om Gurdjieff or those of his own later development-interposes between the recorded experience and the reader. For example, his account of dream ing was begun in 1905, revised several times in accordance with his changing ideas and published in 1931 as an adj unct to a body of thought to which Ouspensky then ref erred as a \"system .\" In some cases it is possible to trace the develo pment of his thinking, but in others the dividing line between reportage and hindsight is .. 119t so clearly mark ed. Although this need not affect an assessment of his ide as, it limits the scope of a biogra pher. At about the age of five, Ouspensky learned to read . A year or so later he discovered Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time and Turge nev's Notes from a Sportsman's Album . In a household of Russian \"intelligents\" there was nothing odd in such books being available to a six-year-o ld, and Ouspensky's precoc iousness in taking to the classics at such an early age was the beg inning of a largely self -conducted educa tion. The \"enormous impressio n\" produced by these two books was a lasting influence on the boy. A Hero of Our Time, with its protago nist the very type of the disillusioned romantic, its exotic Caucasian backg round, and its occasional"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"96 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE hints of the numinous, had made the book a cult amo:p.g youth. Turgenev's gentle tales of country life directed the attention of the literary world toward the realities of peasant existence . Both books would have fo rmed part of the required reading of the generation to which Ouspensky's parents belonged; and they stood in the naturalistic tradition which was then fashionabl e. Ouspensky was to make a name fo r himself on the crest of the Symbolist wave which overw helmed such standar ds; but, as his only novel shows, he never lost the gifts of precise observation and a romantic attitude to nature which charact erized his early masters in literatu re. Soon after his literary exploratio ns had begun, he discovered poetry and painting, started to draw, and developed a lasting enthusiasm fo r engravings and old prints like those which hung on the walls of the house at Pimenovskaya Street. Two peculiar features about Ouspensky's earlier years were directly connected with his later inter ests. The first was his extraordinarily vivid memory of childhood . He later maintained that he could remember several incidents which had happ ened before he was two years old. \"From the age of thr ee,\" he wrote, \"I remember myself quite clearly .\" Among such memories was Moscow of the early 1880s, and an old town called Zvenigorod, thirty miles west of Moscow on the Moscow River. \"I remember the river there, boats with a smell of tar, hills covered with fo rests, the old monastery, etc. I remember the exhibition of 1882 in Moscow, and the coronation of Alexander III, chiefly the illuminatio ns.\" The unusual clarity of his early memories later became connected in Ouspensky's mind with the frequent sense of deja vu which he had experienced as a child. \"With me,\" he wrote, \"these sensations ... began when I was about six years old. Af ter eleven they became much rarer. One of them, extraordinary fo r its vividness and persistence, occurred when I was nineteen. The same sensations, but without a clearly pronounced feeling of repetition, began still earlier, from very early childhoo d, and were particularly vivid during the years when the sensations of repetition appear ed, that is, from six to eleven; and they also came later from time to time in various conditions .\" During childhood Ouspensky shared these experiences with his younger sister, to whom he was very close. Later he described to his pupils how they used to sit at their nursery window and make accurate predictions of events which took place in the street below. The children concealed their ability from the grown-up members of the family, because-as Ouspensky's sister contemptuously remarked-'They don't understand anythin g.\" The sensation of \"I have been here bef ore\" was to prove the greate st single impulse in Ouspensky's life, and it is one of the pervading themes of the novel, Strange Life of Ivan Osokin , which he drafted in 1905. The novel deals with the schooldays and Wanderjahre of Ivan Osokin, and the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 97 impression that it is strictly \"autobiographical\" should be qua lified. Ivan Osokin was written to illustrate the theme of eternal recurrence, and the incidents are shaded according to the author's didactic purpos e. Ouspensky later said that he was \"never suc::h a fo ol as Osokin\" and that many of the events of the novel were borrowed fr om the lives of his acquaintance s. Despite these qualifications and despite the fa ct that the English edition of Ivan Osokin was considerably rewritten before publication , there is much of purely biog raphical value in the novel. Ouspensky adm itted that the heroi ne, Zinaida, was a real person, and, like Ivan Osokin, Ouspensky was expelled from scho ol. This last fact dominated his early life. The Second Moscow Gymnasium at which Ouspensky (and his alter ego Osokin) studied was a school arranged on the standard Russian government pattern based on the classical curric ulum. Ouspensky loathed the school routine, and Ivan Osokin is redolent of the atmosphere of petty regula tions, boredom and ink-stained squalor which the boarders at the Gymnasium had to endure . He hated Latin and Greek and fo und the work as irksome as the discipline . In the novel the only classes in which Osokin avoids disgrace are the French lessons, becau se his French is already far beyond the abilities of his contemporar ies. He finds solace in a series of \"fantastic dream s which, in the past, were responsible fo r many unprepared lessons and fo r many bad marks . The dream s are called 'Trav els in Oceanis .' They are his best method of running away fr om reality .\" These daydre ams take Osokin on adve nturous Pacific voyages inspired by Captain Marryat, and they are eVidently based on Ouspensky's own boyhood dream s of travel and the sea. Ouspensky's main purpose in his account of Osokin's daydre ams was to show the delusory effects of the imaginati on. But his description of the \"Tra vels in Ocean is\" demonstrates another aspect of his fantasy- life which he noticed in his studies of dreaming some years later. \"There was in me an artist, sometimes very naive , sometimes very subtle, who worked at these dreams and created them out of the material which I possessed but could never use in fu ll measure while awake .\" But he was \"never such a fool as Osokin ,\" and as the pupils were left very much to themselves, he continued surreptitiously to educate himself along his own lines. At the age of twelve, he became interested in scientific subjects: first it was natural history and biology, then physi cs. In the Introduction to A New Model of the Universe, he evokes the memory of a preparation class in 1890 or 1891. Instead of the prescribed Latin grammar he is reading a physics textbook, overwh elmed with wonder at the magnificence of the idea of levers-the phenomena which the principle explai ns, and the very class of leyer strike him as a revelation of the unity of things . He fa lls foul of the German proctor, who confiscates his book . \"I hear round me ironical whispers and comments that Ouspensky reads"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"98 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE physi cs.

His charac ter, Ivan Osokin retreats from reality and- almost deliberat ely, Ouspensky hints-breaks a succe ssion of rules. The authorities are more and more annoyed at his conduct, and eventually , a harmle ss practical joke during the visit of an inspector of schools results in Osokin's expulsi on. Like Osokin's, Ouspensky's career in formal education ended about the age of fourteen or fifteen. Osokin's greate st emotion in the novel is remorse for the pain which his expulsion has inHicted on his mother. He immedi ately promises to work hard under a tutor in order to pass into university even more quickly than he would have done from school, and the university is the great goal which Osokin promises himself. Ouspensky never obtained a university degree , and it is possible to see in some of his work-in the length of his published books, in the ambitious nature of his ideas, and in the later structure of his own activities-a pressure for some compensating achievement. An important consequence of Ouspensky's expulsion from the Gym­ nasium found its way into his later teach ing. This was his insistence on the necessity of submitting to the discipline of a school . The word \"school ,\" shorn of its article in the Russian manner, is still part of the jargon of his followers , and Ouspensky's search for an \"esoteric school\" became one of his greate st drive s. The discipline which he imposed on his pupils he learned from Gurdj ieff, but the insistence on rules was his own. \"A man is unable to keep watch on the whole of himself, that is, on all his different sides ,\" Gurdjieff told him. \"Only school can do this, school methods, school discipline-a man is much too lazy, he will do a great deal without the proper intensity, or he will do nothing at all while thinking that he is doing something; he will work with intensity on something that does not need intensity and will let those moments pass by when intensity is imperati ve. Then he spares himself; he is afraid of doing anything unpleasant . He will never attain the necessary intensity by himse lf. If you have observed yourselves in a proper way you will agree with this.\" Gurdjieff certainly meant the statement to be taken generally, but the emphasis given to the idea by Ouspensky was entirely personal . Another result of his expulsion from school was that Ouspensky's education continued along its eclectic and self-willed course. From this fact came aspects of his character both attractive and forbidding. His occasional arrogance and dictatorial manner -although no doubt sometimes as­ sumed -are very much part of the self-educated philosoph er. On the other hand, from his lack of orthodox schooling came a breadth of interests and a wide culture which belong to the polymath and not to the academic special ist. Ouspensky enrolled as a \"free listener\" at Moscow University, a"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAI NST LIFE 99 status which allowed him to attend what lectures he pleased without working for a formal degree. He may also have studied with a tutor fo r a time after leaving school ; but it is impossible to distinguish any set course of instruction . In 1894, at the age of sixteen, he discovered Nietzsche . Two years later he started to write . He studied biology, mathematics and psychology \"very intensel y.\" In mathematics he became \"enormously excited\" by theories of the fo urth dimension, and in psychology his chief interest was a topic which had intrigued him from the age of thirteen -the study of dream s. In all these avenues of inquiry, Ouspensky's attitude was that of the rebel. \"I was very anarchistically inclined at that time,\" he wrote . \"I particularly distrusted all fo rms of acade mic science and took a firm decision never to pass any examinations and never to take any degrees .\" This has the savor of sour grapes, and it is a common attitude to find among adepts of the occult arts. But it is also the sort of attitude which can lead a man to see beneath appearance s-al ways assuming that there is something to see. At the end of the nineteenth century, scientific materia lism had begun to appear as constricting a series of dogmas as the religions it had displac ed. The epidemic of occultism arose as a fo rm of overreaction to this fact. A less hysterical attitude was displayed by many farsighted men; fo r indeed if science had remained crudely mechanistic, had failed to develop concepts like relativity and the uncertainty principle , there were, by definition , limits to the expansion of knowledge . Ouspensky was dissatisfied with the stagnant state of affairs. \"I fe lt that there was a dead wall everyw here, even in mathemat ics, and I used to say at that time that professors were killing science in the same way as priests were killing religion .\" He saw his tre asured idea of the fourth dimension trampled beneath scientific feet. Instead of the liberating possibilities he sensed in the concept, it was turned into an academic game. At the same time, he did not yet dare to abandon the materia list standpoint and remained fo r the time being an orthodox rationa list. In 1896 Ouspensky undertook what he calls \"my first independent travel s.\" He had already visited Paris with his family fo r the Exposition of 1888, and his newf ound independence probably related to his mother's death . Between 1896 and 1905 there is little known with certainty about his movements. The early part of this period was taken up with studies and tra veling. He later told Rom Landau that he attended lectures at various Russian and European universitie s, but it is impossible to find out which . He knew Paris well, and his fluent French would have made it easy fo r him to fo rm-like a character in Ivan Osokin-part of Georges Sorel's audience at the Sorbonne. He also explored the wilder parts of Russia, visiting the remot e monasteries of the far north , and once described to Maurice Nicoll"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE how he had managed to repay the Circassian villages through which he tra veled for their ruinously generous hospitality . The technique was to admire a small object of no value, whereupon the host would be bound under his code of honor to give it to you. The guest then insisted that his host accept a gift in excha nge; and Ouspensky carried a number of cheap revolvers with which to reimburse his benefactors . About 1900, soon after he was twenty-one, Ouspensky's long-standing interest in dreams led him to make a series of observati ons. He had already devoured most of the psychological literature on the subject, so he began by attempting to write down his dreams on waking. \"I said to myself that if I could know in sleep that I was asleep I should find the possibility of continuing the dream s, or of going behind them and perhaps finding their cause .\" He very soon found that his attempts to record dreams produced distortion and alteration of the dream experience itself. This led to the discovery of a method of observing dreams in what Ouspensky called a \"half -dream state ,\" which was brought about by deliberate effort either just before falling asleep or after awakening. His observations convinced Ouspensky that in the majority of cases-what he called \"simple dreams\"­ a dream was the product of associatio ns--either physical associatio ns resulting from the position of the dreamer's body, or psychical associatio ns resulting from unconscious preoccupat ions. He fo und occasional exam ples of dreams which seemed to have almost boundless significance fo r the dreamer; but the most interesting conclusion he reached-and which was to be of great importance in preparing him fo r the ideas of Gurd jieff-was the conviction that dreams continue in waking life. Theref ore, he could afterward say, there was little justification fo r making a sharp diff erence between being asleep and being awake. To the state of sleep was added what was called \"the waking state\" but which should really be known as \"sleep plus waking state .\" How long this scholar-gypsy life lasted is uncerta in. Ouspensky was attracted by journalism and by 1905 it had become his profession. His job gave him the chance to travel to Europe and the Ea.st Coast of the United States, journeys which may have taken place at any time up to 1912. America provides the setting fo r an unsucces sful story called \"The Invento r,\" which tells the reader little about its author apart from his distaste fo r the cruder forms of capita lism. During the political troubles which culminated in the revolution of 1905, Ouspensky wrote the original version of Ivan Osokin, entitled The Wheel of Fortune, which was published ten years later under the title Kinema­ dr ama. Only general ideas can be gleaned from the novel about what he had been doing, but Ivan Osokin does provide flesh to cover the bare bones of ten years of studies and journalism. It reveals the man Ouspensk y-the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 101 charming, romantic, convivial artist -who became hidden by the teacher's severity and the facade of serious intellectualism built up by his inner compuls ions. The charming Tanechka idyll and the military episode in Ivan Osokin have little to associate them with what we know of Ouspensky from other sources, but like all Osokin's disasters, these involve a woman. Suscep­ tibility is part of his Achilles heel-as Gurd jieff would have said, his Chief F eature -but it is an attractive susceptibility stemming from an incorrigibly romantic attitude to life. He fe els the experience of his night with Tanechka as magic, as a poetic truth naturally appre hended. It has nothing to do with the physical explanation of the act of love. By the time Ouspensky came to write Tertium Organum (1912), his early lyricism had abated not at all. If anything, it had increased, and the chapter on \"Occultism and Love\" occupies a key place in that book. Ouspensky had great trouble with this chapter, and the concern he showed for it demons trates the impor tance he attached to the subject. Between the first Russian edition of 1912 and the second of 1916, the section was considerably revised and expanded ; and it was the only chapter to be significantly altered in the second English edition of 1922. Even in his final version, Ouspen sky retained the same poetic association between love and the world of nature as he had implied in the Tanechka passages of Ivan Osok in. \"In the springtime with the first awakening of love's emotions the birds begin to sing and build nests,\" he write s. Perhap s, he suggests, bird song is not just the means of attract ing a mate-as scientists would have us �elieve-but \"the principal function\" of a species, necessary for some unrecog nized natural harmony. In the 1916 version of Tertium Orga num, revised with no reference to Gurd jieff's ideas , Ouspensky declares ex­ plicitly that the hidden purposes of love provide the key to the mysteri es: It is difficult to understand all this and to make it seem rational. But by seeking to understand these mysterious purposes and by departing from mundane interpr etatio ns, man, without even being conscious of it at first unites himself with the higher purposes and finds that thread which in the end of all ends will lead him out of the labyrinth of earthly contradicti ons. The Ouspensky of 1905 found his consolations in the mysteries of love. He had not completely broken from the materiali sm of the age when he completed the first draft of Ivan Osokin, but the romantic vision oflove had eVidently come to replace his schoolboy fantasy life as the \"magical\" element in his world. The chivalrous attitude to women which this evoked"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE persisted till the end of Ouspensky's life, and became part of his basic outlook . Ivan Osokin sees women as \"more interesting\" than men. The later Ouspensky was to see them as belonging to a higher caste altogethe r, and the courtesy which he showed his women fo llowers is at one with this attitude . In the days when the word \"normal\" meant super human in the language of his groups, love remained an example of glorious normality; and when two of his pupils announced their engag ement, he wrote to them of his pleasure at hearing of something really normal in a perverted age . Connected with the hints of something more which the young Ouspensky fo und in sex were the promptings of other things fe lt by the artist in him. Toward the end of Ivan Osokin, the hero and Zinaida discuss literatu re. Osokin writes poems, about which he is very sensitive. He prefers those of one line only, fo r then the reader must experience the rest of the poem in himself. Zinaida's fr iends cannot understand this, and are scathing about Osokin's \"impressions from beyon d.\" Between such conventional attitudes and those of Osokin's creat or, there was an ever-widening gulf; fo r the notion of the complete autonomy of the poem itself and the idea of poetry coming fr om \"beyond\" betray the influence of Symbolist theories to which Ouspensky was exposed at the time he wrote Ivan Osok in. The various occult and religious groups which sprang up in turn of the century Russia were closely linked with the Symbolist movement in literature . Just as mystics and magicians traveled from Paris to hawk their wares in the incense-filled gloom of Slavic piety, artistic fa shions were imported from the cultural capital of the wor ld. Paris of the 1880s and 1890s had reacted again st natura lism in art and materia lism in philosophy; and the occult doctrines of the magi directly influenced artistic practi ce. In particu lar, the idea of the symbol as a link between the dimly apprehended magical universe and the world of everyday fo und a place in the new antinaturalist literature . The Russian intelligentsia eagerly adopted such concepts . Their flight into mysticism was encouraged by an exclusion fr om their natural part in the social agitation whi ch culminated in the revolution of 1905-during which Ouspensky wrote his novel-and it fo rms part of a luxuriant crop of near- myst ical literatu re, much of which simply obeyed the fa shionable fo rms, but some of which indicated a real religious striving. The high priest of the Russian intelligentsia was Vladi mir Sergeivitch Soloviev (1853-1900) who contrived to fu se Symb olist occultism with Russian piety and make the resulting mixture intellectually palatab le. He predicted the coming of the \"God-ma n\"-man perf ected by his own eff orts toward divinity. After his death there was a mushroom growth of societies with names like \"The Circle of Seekers of Christian Enlightenment\" and \"The Religi ous-Ph ilosophic Society in Mem ory of Vladimir Solovi ev.\" It became difficult to distinguish the poets from philosophe rs, and philoso-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAI NST LIFE 103 phers from priests. The most famous literary names include: Andrei Bely, Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Vyacheslav Ivanov, and Alexander Blok. Halfway between the writers and the occulti sts proper came unconventional philosophers like Dmitri Merezhkovsky, Nicholas Ber­ dyaev, and V. V. Rozanov. They represent a tradition of thought which is llmost completely forgotten in the West, and a closer acquaintance with their work makes Ouspensky's ideas a little less extraordinary than they seemed when he first became known outside Russia. The idea of eternal recurrence on which the book is based is taken chiefly from Nietzsche; and all over Europe at the turn of the century Nietzsche had become inextricably entangled with the occult and Symbolist literature . lndeed, the Russian Decadence began with Nietzsche, when in 1890 Nikolai Minsky published a Zarathustra-like thesis on the liberty of the individual . But it was characte ristic of Ouspensky's approach to intellectual fashions that, whereas other intellectuals hailed Nietzsche as a liberator from the prison of bourgeois morality , he was fascinated by the theory of eternal recurre nce, which even some ardent Nietzscheans preferred to regard as an aberrati on. The thought that time repeats itself in identical cycles is to be found in antiquity . Nietzsche probably took it from Pythagoras and Heraclit us, and Ouspensky himself unearthed it in the Alexandrian Fathers. Ouspensky's description of its implications is found in A New Model of the Universe . This means that if a man was born in 1877 and died in 1912, then, having died, he finds himself again in 1877 and must live the same life all over again. In dying, in completing the circle of life, he enters the same life from the other end. He is born again in the same town, in the same street, of the same parents, in the same year and on the same day. He will have the same brothers and sisters, the same uncles and aunts, the same toys, the same kittens, the same friends, the same wome n. He will make the same mistakes, laugh and cry in the same way, rejoice and suffer in the same way. And when the time comes he will die in exactly the same way as he did before, and again at the moment of his death it will be as though all the clocks were put back to 7.35 A.M. on the 2nd September 1877, and from this moment started again with their usual movement. To Nietzsche the problem posed by recurrence was simple. He accepted it in his capacity as Superman. \"Who can desire the recurrence oflife?\" he asked, and answer ed: \"The great, strong, happy man, whose life is so valuable in his estimati� that a repetition and continually a repetition will be a pleasant thought to him. To everyone else, to everything miserable ,"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE misbegott en, which only looks upon its own life with dissati sfaction and repugnance , the thought must be frightfu l.\" Ouspensky's use of the idea was anything but a slavish copying of Nietzsc he. Later he was to transform the Nietzschean idea of the Superman in a similar fashion. For Nietzsche , \"the great, strong, happy man\" with the successful will to power might reconcile himself to eternity repeating and repeating in endless cycles, \"the worm Ourobouros who eateth his own tail .\" But Ivan Osokin lives his life again in an atmosphere of regret for missed opportunitie s. His final crushing disappo intment in the love aff air with Zinaida ends with him contemplating suicide . His lif e lived over again has the same results: and the more hopeful ending of the later English version did not form part of The Wheel of Fortune . Ouspensky later used to tell his pupils that Robert Louis Stevenson had taught him as much as Nietzsche about recurrence , and Stevenson's view of the coils of time is pessimistic. The haunting \"Song of the Morrow\"- published posthumously in Stevenson's Fables of 1896-is a recurring theme in Ivan Osokin . It would have been natural reading for a young romanti o--and Stevenson's tale of the King of Duntrine's daughte r, who had \"hair like the spun gold and ... eyes like pools in a river,\" ends with the princess as an ancient crone warning her younger self that she has \" no thought for the morrow and no power upon the hour, after the manner of simple men.\" Writing, as he did, at a time of civil and personal chaos, Ouspensky's life seemed not at all worth repeating, and eternal recurrence can only have presented itself as an assurance of eternal damnati on. For in 1905 he was eVidently in a very depressed state. His aff air with the original of Zinaida had ended unhappily, and if his financial circumstances were anything like Osokin's, he was very pressed for money. Poverty and refusal to take a secure job are two of the reasons which Osokin gives for the collapse of his affair. ''I'm a stranger and an outsid er,\" he compla ins, \"and it's the same everywhere .\" In the middle of great political upheavals , which ended in armed revolution in Moscow and led the Tsar at last to grant a constituti on, Ouspensky's disillusionment with politics was complete . Strange Life of Ivan Osokin is full of denunciations of the futility of the \"comrade s,\" whose cabals confront Osokin in Switzerland, Paris, and Moscow. He does not believe in revoluti on, although he shares the \"almost obligatory\" antigove rnment attitude of the intellig entsia. He sees other possibilities \"if only those in official positions would not be so childishly selfish and stupid.\" Ouspensky later described his dilemma in propria persona: \"I mistrusted and disliked all kinds of socialism even more than industrialism or militarism .... But when I became interested in journal­ ism I could work only on 'left' papers because 'right' papers did not smell good. It was one of the complexities of Russian life.\""},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"RUSSIAN EMPIRE Ekate rinodar • ·Stavropol .Maikop /I\" /I • .Mineralny Vodi \",,1'\\ ,.... fV\\ Essen tuki . ·py ati gorsk '\\... . \" /I \"/\\ 1\\ Tuapse Ueh Darye Sochi \"\".

His beloved younger sister had joined an extreme left-wing organization and was impris oned for revolutionary activi ties in the Boutirsky prison in Moscow, where in 1908, she died. Disillusioned with orthodox science , with politics , both established and revolutionary, recov ering from an unhappy love affair, Ouspensky may have had little to sustain him: but the innate romantic is not easily cast down. His real searc h began in the autumn of 1907; and before following him on this new chapter of his existence, we must try to see more of the man behind the questing spirit. Physically, the young man of 1905 was a more fragile version of his later short and thickset self. A heavy jaw emphasized the dogmatic or domineer­ ing side of his nature, a facet which was to alienate several people who met him. A severe mouth, ]argish nose, and receding hair made up the rest of a not extraordinary face which, apart from the high Slav cheekbo nes, might have been Teutonic. The most noticeable aspect of his appearance was the pince-nez which his very short sight invariably demanded, and in later years he usually carried about with him a whole armory of glas ses and binoculars . Thie fa scination with precision instrumen ts-in the case of optical glasses, of necessity--extended to weapons. The story of his carrying cheap revolvers with him through the Caucasus may show that the interest in guns which he demonstrated in England took root early, and in India he carried both camera and revolver. Ouspensky's romanticism expressed itself in a love of nature. His description of Ivan Osokin's ride in the country is the detailed observation of a keen horseman, and Ouspensky in the saddle was a common sight in later life. But cats were his chief love, and he noticed them wherever he went. In Tertium Organum he made several points about the difference in consci ousness between man and animals which were based on his observa­ tion of cats. In his letters from the Caucas us in the midst of revolution , he had time to observe a dead cat. The ending of Ivan Osokin refers to two obscurely significant cats. Ouspensky brought a cat with him to England or acquired one very soon after his arrival , and toward the end of his life, he could scarcely be separated from his pets, which came to his meetings. He said that they had astral bodies, and might benefit from instruction .. On his last strange journeys his cats accompanied him. J. G. Bennett records a tradition that in the Ouspensky family the names Peter and Damian had passed alternately from father to son. The Damians were supposed to be world-rejecting ascetics and the Peters to enter with zest into the joys of life. Ouspensky thought that both Peter and Damian had influenced his chara cter. The conflict betwee n the ascetic side of his nature and the part which made him a heavy drinker and a connoisseur of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 107 fo od was a battle he never resolved . A powerful ascetic drive lay behind his spiritual quest and his intellectual rej ection of the material worl d; but it was the bon viveur who told Maurice Nicoll that he thought he had been born with the noise of a tavern in his blood. For all his fe elings of \"not belonging,\" the young Ouspensky most certainly tried to enjoy himself. Several scenes in Ivan Osokin are set at parties, and when Carl Bechhof er Roberts ran acro ss Ouspensky in the wreck of the White Armies in 1919, he made a record of an evening they spent togeth er during which his compa nion reminisced about his early Moscow days. The circumstances were something out of the ordina ry-all those concerned were probably tired and very hungry, and had been celebrating their acqu isition of coal with \"vodka\" made from raw spirit. Ouspensky remembered another occasion on which the miraculous effects of improvised spirits had been noticeabl e. \"It was when I was a young man in Mosco w, \" he was saying, \"and my cousin once gave a party. We brewed the vodka together . It was a marvellous brew. There was one man there , the sort of type one sees only in Russia; a young man with long hair, a long beard, long moustac hes, and a sad, fa r-away look in his eyes. Well, after he had one glass of our vodka, he got straight up from his chair and walked out of the house and into the nearest hairdr essers. There he made them run the clippers over his head, and shave him, and he came out as bare of hair as an egg, and went straight home to bed. That shows you what good vodka can do!\" The conversation changed tack, by way of a story of Ouspensky's and the intervention of another member of the party. Then Ouspensky returned to his theme of the gay life of Moscow: \"Don't interrupt me,\" said Ouspensky. \"I was remarking that every policeman in Moscow in the old days knew me by my Christian name, beca use, unlike most peop le, when I was drunk, I always tried to compose quarrels and not to start them. Besides, I used to give them big tips. And all the porters at the restaurants used to know me, and when there was a row on, they used to telephone me to come round and stop it. One night I remember I got home with the left sleeve of my overcoat missing. How I lost it, and where, I have never disc overed, although I have given the matter very careful thoug ht. Indeed, I once thought of writing a book about it.\" This subject would have suited his quirkish turn of mind, and the literary world in which he moved might have received it well. The combination of"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE roistering and spiritual search was a pattern familiar in Symbolist Russia, and indeed, the conflict between the Peter and the Damian was a typically Russian struggle . Like many romantics , Ouspensky retained an inner purita nism as part of his romantic attitude. This showed itself in a refusal to be taken in by the cheap and shoddy, and developed into an inability to compr omise. It was a temperament not uncommon among the Russian intellectua ls. The mystical bent of the intelligentsia has already been noted, but there was another consequence of their alienation which is relevant to Ouspensky. Harold William s, who was for a long period The Times's correspondent in Russia and married an \"intellig ent,\" put his finger on the spot: \"The life of the intelligents was simple, but not ascetic. Many members drank to excess, and there were some who drank themselves to death in search of a refuge from the terrible depression that hung constantly over the Russian educated man, and made the life of the intelligentsia essen tially a sad one.\" Ouspensky's personal situation increased the sense of hopelessness induced by his milieu. His friend Boris Mouravieff once summed up Ouspensky's state of inner weakn ess. \"Charming -although subject to fits of temper, kind, very skilful in argument, he was not a strong man ... Full of ideas, tender-hearted , a talented writer, he was not protected internally by the valuable armouring of the scientific method. Everything in him was unanchored , and so open to outside influenc es. And he was very isolated in life, which did not spare him disappoint ments .\" Criticism of his own vulnerability is a strong theme in Ivan Osakin, and it agrees with Gurdjieff's estimate of Ouspensky's chara cter: \"Very nice man to drink vodka with, but weak man.\" But this weakn ess accounts for the nature of much of his work, and in his work it becomes a source of strength. Ouspensky was more of an original thinker than most of Gurdjieff's followers, but he always needed material on which to operate , whether it was eternal recurrence, the Superman, occult ism, or the fo urth dimension. All these ideas received twists at his hands which made them seem completely original, but they did not proceed from him in the first place . They were \"outside influences\" like those to which Mouravieff refers, and Ouspensky's treatment of his material always had more the flavor of art than of philosophy . His most striki�g ideas are flashes of inspirati on, which he emphasizes by italics in his text; his completed structures have the autonomy of works of art rather than the balance of reasoned argument. In this lies both his. value and the secret of his succe ss. As the subjective artist, he responded to preoccupati ons or waves of feeling which were in the air and drew out of the ideas he used implications which their originators did not know they possessed. The Ouspensky of 1905 was the typical outsider figure of his time and"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 109 place . At the beginning of this novel, Osokin bewa ils his lack of prospects and his social isolati on, and toward the end of [van Osokin, Zinaida and her lover discuss the responsibilities of women. Osokin argues the Ouspenskian theory that woman must be extremely fastidious in her choice of a mate, because she bears the responsibility for natural select ion. \"Woman ,\" he says, \"does not demand enough from man fo r his own sake.\" Can she not \"demand a great deal for herself ?\" asks Zinaida. \"That is quite another question ,\" says Osokin . \"That is life . I was never interested in this.\" What Ouspensky means by life is explained in a much later work, A New Model of the Universe . For this gray existence-\"deeply-rooted petrified routine life\"-he uses the Russian word byt. Byt refers to life in external forms, or to firmly established circumstances. Ouspensky tells us that one may speak of \"peasants' byt, merchants' byt, country landow ners' byt\"; also of a \"byt actor\" in a play. For people of byt \"there can be in their lives nothing unexpected , nothing accidental, no adventur es.\" Such monotony seemed unbearable to the young Ouspensky. The horror of a fe atureless existence would have been redoubled in the mind of a man who had just discovered eternal recurrence by the prospect of that life repeati ng . . . and repeating and repea ting. . . . The trap was closing in. He continued to fe el that sexual experience held the key to a better world, and preserved a dogged faith in a life other than this life which appalled him and from which he was separated by such a distance . He was confronted with the irritati ng fatalism of the people of byt, \"in some cases passing into a kind of ironical contempt for people who are restless, seeking fo r something, striving after something .\" So Ouspensky rejected life and set out to discover a larger and fuller life. Vague hints of a magical universe beyond resolved themselves into a specific quest. An undirected striving became a search for the miraculo us.

The autumn of 1907 was a time of great Theosophical activity in Russia. Although the Society itself was still officially ba nned, two regular groups with their own publishing house had been fo unded in 1905, and in November 1908, Theosophy at last became tolerated officia lly. At the same time, the revolution of 1905 had sent numbers of the intelligentsia scuttling acro ss the frontier to Paris where, in the fo llowing year, they attended lectures by the rapidly rising star, Rudolph Steiner. Steiner's mistress, Marie von Sivers, was a Baltic Russian and through her Steiner's influence was transmitted to the Russian intelligentsia. A number of conversions resulted, among them, the poet Andrei Bely. Ouspensky's Theosophical contacts came about as the intelligentsia swung even more directly to occu ltism in the aftermath of the abortive revoluti on. Suddenly the shades of the prison house light ened. Ouspensky began to see more clearly that there was a way out of the trap, away, what was more, . that asserted the real value of the poetic and mysterious world of which he had only preserved the hope. In a rush, he aban doned the materia list view of lif e. \"For so long I have held myself in,\" he wrote , \"have denied myself all dreams about things that could not be held within these bounds .\" Meaning poured itself out upon him from so many unnoticed portions of the universe. Fairy tales and superstitions began to disclose their proper significance . The natural world became animate to his perception. The traditions of Russian Orthodoxy again acquired the aspect of compre hensi­ ble truth . \"And the greatest mystery and the greatest miracle was that the thought became possible that death may not exist ... \" It is clear from Ivan Osokin that Ouspensky was deeply affected by the- death of his mother, and who knows of what other friends he may not have been thinking?

Later he claimed that he had \"at once\" seen that the weak side of Theosophical literature was that \"it had no continuation .\" Presuma bly this means that it had taken on dogmatic fo rm, and could ther ef ore not continue to provi<le the lif e-giving impulse which it had originally deliv­ ered . Altho ugh at first he did swallow some of the more fan tastic flights of fa ncy, Ouspensky sucked out the yolk fr om his Theosophical rea ding. He learned that there was a way to study religion as a body of knowledge which meant something. Like Gurdjieff, he discovered the idea of the esoteric Tradition of secret wisdom . This all pointed onward to the lif e beyond lif e of which Ouspensky had intimati ons. He decided that if consci ousness could be proved to exist apart fr om the body, this would open the way to proving many other things . In def au lt of such a demonstration, he returned to his early studies of the fo urth dimension. If-he suddenly saw-the fo urth dimension was considered from a psychological point of view rath er than from the standpoint of mathematic s, it could provide a justification fo r the universe beyond the material universe, a door into the lif e beyond lif e. Bef ore, he had shied away fr om the idea; now he plunged into fr esh researches which linked the fo urth dimension with esoteric ism. He resolved to write a book which would tell the world of the connections he had discovered, but this was hardly begun when he gave up in despair. \"I cannot make myself write about the limitless possibilities of knowledge when fo r myself I already see the limit. The old methods are no good; some other methods are necessary .\" The question had bec ome: \"how to go beyond?\" The answer lay in the going -a journey into the self, and a search fo r present-day custodians of the esoteric Tradition in lands where the occul tists thought they might be fo und. In 1908 he made an expedition through the Mi ddle East with a fri end called Sherbakov . In Const antinople he visited the Mevlevi dervishes in Pera and was mystified by their whirli ng. What was the secret of the dance, and what was the nature of the intense mental eff ort which seemed to accompany it?

Some time during this trip in the winter of 1908, he had an intimation of the expanded consciousness which his later experiments were to induce. It happened on a steamer in the sea of Marmora: A wave would run at the ship, raised as if desiring to hurl its crest upon it, rushing up with a howl. The steamer heeled, shuddered, and slowly straightened back; then from afar a new wave came running. I watched this play of the waves with the ship, and felt them draw me to themselves. It was not that desire to jump down which one feels in mountains but something infinitely more subtle. The waves were drawing my soul to themselves. And suddenly I felt it went to them. It lasted an instant, perhaps less than an instant, but I entered into the waves and with them rushed with a howl at the ship. And in that instant [ became all. The waves-they were myself: the far violet mountains, the wind, the clouds hurrying from the north, the great steamship, heeling and rushing irresis tibly forward-all were my­ self. ... It was an instant of unusual freedom, joy and expansion. A second­ and the spell of charm disappeared. In early 1909 Ouspensky left Moscow for St. Petersburg. He was now reading intensively in occult and mystical literature, and by 1911, when he began to write The Symbol ism of the Tarot and Tertium Organum, he had a thorough knowledge of Theosophy and the French magical revival. He had investigated seventeenth-century mysticism in the shape of Jacob Boehme and his pupil Gichtel, had delved into the mysteries of Neo-Platonism and Alexandrian Christianity, and rediscovered the mystical traditions of Russian Orthodoxy and the monks of Athos. This reading must have influenced the results of the experiments which he carried out in 1910 and 191 1, but Ouspensky himself found nothing for which he was prepared in the beyond he was so earnestly seeking. In stead, he was \"carried far beyond the limits of the known and possible .\" His experiments consisted of an attempt to alter the state of normal consciousness by means of yogic and magical methods. He does not say so explicitly, but it is obvious from the nature of his experiences and from his interest in n�cotics that a chief agent was some sort of drug. This was almost certainly hashish, although he may also have used nitrous oxide. Ouspensky's mystical experiments remain extremely valuable for anyone interested in the borderlands of psychology. It is possible to disagree with"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAI NST LIFE 11 3 the classification he made at the outset and still discover suggestive material . He divided the phenomena in which he was interested into \"objective magic ,\" \"subjective magic ,\" and \"mys ticism.\" By objective magic he meant the class of directly magical phenomena which scie nce broadly speaking denied: the ability to influence things or people at a distance , through time, or beyond the grave; and the \"mental phenomena\" of the psychic researc her: clairvoyance , telepathy and the whole apparatus of Theosophical seership which included seeing the aura and thought fo rms. Subjective magic comprised the matter of self -hypnosis, hallucinatio ns, and dreams taken as reality. Mysticism, he thought, was always subjective, and associated with the intensified emotional states provoked by religious practice s. The main object which he set himself was to see whether ob jective magic had any real existence apart from the phenomena of subjective magic or mystic ism. He achieved results much more quickly than he expected . But in his first contact with the unknown, he encountered an unexpected difficulty . The unknown-was unkno wn. No familiar categ ories could be applied to it, no everyday language could describe it. In the beyond, all phenomena were linked with other phenomena, every aspect of the unfamiliar explained and was explained by some other facet of the great whole. The experimenter began to see why accounts of mystical experience had seemed to him so flat and contriv ed; the beyond was no place fo r words, and if words were used to try to convey something of the experience, they would be in the jargon to which the writer was accustomed: Theosoph ist, philosopher, or man of religion , each would use the language of his inherita nce. In this observa­ tion, as in his accounts of alterations in the time sense and the difficulty in communicating with others , Ouspensky's reports tally with those of much later investig ators . He was years ahead of his time, and the clarity of mind which he subsequently brought to bear on his experiences might profitably have been taken as an example by later experim enters. The first result of his experiments was to give Ouspensky a sense of the duality of hims elf: he found he was able to observe his Ow n reacti ons. Under favorable circumstanc es, this state heralded his entrance into a world \"entirely new and entirely unknown to me, which had nothing in common with the world in which we live.\" This universe might be described as \"a world of mathematical relations\" in which there was no diviSion between subject and object, observer, and observed. Passage to this ultimate apprehension was not immediate or assured. Ouspensky distinguished between several states of drug-induced con­ sciousness. There was a transitional state , of which he became very wary, especially after the voices which spoke to him during this sta ge started to haunt his ordinary life. He fo und he could ask the voices questions like"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 THE HARMO NIOUS CIRCL E those asked of spirit mediums at seanc es, and oCCQSionally discovered clairvoyant effects. Often his experiments stopped here; but sometimes he passed to a \"second threshold\" which led to the universe of mathematical relati ons. This contained the answer to all questions and was in a perpetual state of flux. In this world, concepts could only be expre ssed by hiero­ glyph s, what Jacob Boehme had called \"the signatures of things ,\" and Ouspensky came to regard it as the source of all real phenomena. A great part was played beyond the second threshold by the activity of the number 3, which appeared as the creative agitation of the universe. The universe itself was \"like some great trefoil.\" No merely verbal expression, wrote Ouspensky (once more exasperated at the deficiencies of languag e), could give any accurate idea of what he saw. Another result of his experiments was to wean him from Theosophical literature . Later he decided that at the time he had probably been more under Theosophical influence than he imagin ed. He was astonished t o find that the astral world described by occultists did not exist at all. Neither could he induce any effects of \"objective magic .\" The states which his drugs created were beyond his control , and thought was a poor instrument with which to grasp the profound realities he sensed beyond the second threshold. Deep insights recorded in another state of consci ousness vanished in the ambiguities of memoranda like \"Think in other catego ries\" which merely tantalized his normal self. One new concept did emerge from the period of exper iment: the vision of Linga Sharira, the Long Body of man. Ouspensky came upon this insight while thinking of a relative who had died. Suddenly he saw that human life must be considered as a whole , and that a human being was his life extended in time: that it was a wrong definition of man which saw him as a creature bounded by the three dimensions which confined his physical body. To describe the phenomenon \"man,\" the whole extent of his life must be taken into account, which meant adding a fourth dimension ... of Time. He was illuminated . His everyday experience was partial and mistaken; he had been failing to make the right connecti ons. Walking down the Nevsky Prospekt, he was suddenly transfixed by \"an ordinary cab-horse.\" \"Looking at the horse's face I understood all that could be known about a horse. All the traits of horse nature , all of which a horse is capable, aU that it can do, all that it cannot do, all this was expressed in the lines and features of the horse's face.\" Next, a dog revealed itself to him in the same manner. Animals began to seem fragments of larger beings-the \"great horse,\" the \"great dog\"-and in amaz ement, Ouspensky applied his revelation to humanity : \"I understood then that we also are atoms of a great being, the great man.'\" However, barriers still raised themselves before him. His vague belief in"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 115 a lif e better than that of ordinary men had led him to occulti sm: now he passed through occultism to a direct apprehe nsion of the world beyond. He had experienced things fo r himself. But although he now knew of the existence of what he was coming to call \"the miraculous\"-\"the real world that lies behind the wa vering mirage of the visible world\"-he lacked exact conc lusions. How was he to link the world of human aff airs with that other level which created and subsumed it? During the period 1909-12, he continued his journalistic work, probably as a fre elance . He gave public lectures on occult and mystical sub jects, and succe ssfully published the results of his inves tigati ons. He was evidently much in contact with the mystically inclined intelligentsia. From 1909 began his intimacy with A. L. Volin sky, and it is possible that one of the reasons fo r Ouspensky's leaving the more orthodox atmosphere of Moscow fo r the exotic air of St. Petersburg was that in the capital , the new occultism associated with the Symbolists was more acce ssible. In Tertium Organum he mentions meeting M. V. Lodiz hensky, the editor of an anthology called Superconsciousness of which Ouspensky made much use. Lodizhensky had visited Leo Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana and discovered coincidences between Tolstoy's thought and the religious experience of Orthodox mystics . Ouspensky tried to interest Tolstoy in his own experiments and may have made use of this connecti on. Another investig ator of unorthodox religion whom he met was V. A. Dani loff, whose influence may have led him to include some doubtf ul passages about the perception of animals in Tertium Organum . And about the same time he exchanged the more conventional atmosphere of \"holy Mosc ow\" fo r what Madame Blavatsky liked to call \"mystic Petersburg .\" Soon he was a member of the St. Pe tersburg Theosophical Society and had begun to move in the literary and artistic circles which made their headquarters in the fa mous St. Petersburg cabaret, The Stray Dog. The Stray Dog had become an institution in St. Petersburg's Bohemia. It was the scene of impassioned dialog ue, impromptu poetry rea dings, and what would now be called \"happe nings\" of all sorts . Here Andrei Bely, Alexander Blok, or Anna Akhmatova mIght be heard reading their poems, and here the femmes fa tales of the Progressive w orld held court among their ad mirers. Here after the theaters had closed, the acto rs, singers, and musicians would join the literati. Here, as Ouspensky fo ndly remembered, \"nothing wrong could happ en ,\" and he looked back on his period of sociability, carou sing, and impassioned exchange of ideas as a golden age. The Stray Dog was his university, where he talked all night, drank cham pa gne, and met some of the writers who had already made their names. Among these were Valery Bryussov and A. L.

After 1909 Ouspe nsky became a regular partner in discussions with Volynsky (\"whose opinions,\" he writes, \"I valued very much\") and his decisive turn toward mysticism undoubtedly took place under the influence of the occult fashions so much in vogue among the coteries who inhabited The Stray Dog. His new contacts may have provided the stimulus to a period of intense literary activity. Apart from some unpublished writings of dreams and his early work on the Fourth Dimen sion, all the more solid writings which Ouspen sky afterward republished in A New Model of the Universe were begun during the years 1911 and 1912. These include The Symbolism of the Tarot, Superman, What is Yoga ? and a work called The Inner Circle, the ideas of which are incorporated in the chapters of A New Model of the Universe called \"Esotericism and Modern Thought\" and \"Christianity and the New Testame nt.\" This burst of activity strove to communicate Ouspen sky's breakthrough into the world of the beyond. All the accumu­ lated reading of a life spent in hard and unorthodox study was pressed into the service of the new revelation. The topics were very much those to which he had tried to give literary form before his expedition of 1908, and they compose a body of ideas which he almost took for granted while writing the book Tertium Organum which made his name. Ouspensky took over the idea of esotericism from Theosophical and occult literature. That is to say, he believed in a Tradition of hidden knowle dge preserved by an \"inner circle\" of humanity, which concealed itself from the main body of mankind, either, as the Theosophists said, by living in remote areas like Tibet, or by adopting obscure ways of life. Ouspe nsky expanded this idea of the inner circle until the esoteric succession became responsible for the major achievements of mankind. It was \"the brain, or rather the immortal soul, of humanity, where all the attainm ents, all the results, all the achievements, of all cultures and all civilisations are prese rved.\" Behind the outward show of established religions there was always the esoteric religion: for example, the teaching of Christ was esoteric and exclus ive, intended for those who were seeking salvation -th e road to which was known by the inner circle. So much was purely occult thinking; but Ouspensky allied Nietzsche's concept of the Superman to the esoteric point of v;ew. Humanity, he felt, was only a transitional stage; and the evolution of consciousness led toward the Superman state. This necessarily implied an increasing interest in things inexplicable and occult: a broadening of the mental spectrum as man realized the inadequacies of his existing knowledge. Ouspe nsky compared the ascent to Superman with the progress of a candidate through the various initiations of the Greek mysteries -the archetypal esoteric religions. The coupling of Nietzsche to ideas of the spiritual evolution of man was not"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"LIFE AGAINST LIFE 117 entirely new. Many Theo sophists made use of Nietzsche, and the notion of a coming Superman consci ousness had been powerf ully elaborated by A. R. Orage in Eng land some five years earl ier. The early passion that the fo urth dimension had inspired in Ouspensky returned with renewed fo rce as a rational justification fo r the beyond. Even here , he was not really original ; he was fo llowing a line of ar gument pioneered in England by C. H. Hinton and E. A. Abbo tt: but unlike them, Ouspensky took the fo urth dimension as Time, duration . Because this idea is central to Tertium Organum there is little point in discussing it separa tely; but among his less systematic writings on the subject, there is a passage which demonstrates Ouspensky's uncritical acceptance of Hinton's arguments, and which shows how he proceeded from the mere possibility of a fo urth dimension to arguing its necessity: If the fo urth dimension exists, one of two things is possible. Either we ourselves possess the fo urth dimension, i.e. , are beings of fo ur dimensions, or we possess only three dimensions and in that case do not exist at all. If the fo urth dimension exists while we possess only three , it means that we have no real existence , that we exist only in some body's imagination and that all our thoug hts, fe elings and experiences take place in the mind of some other higher being, who visualizes us. We are but products of his mind and the whole of his universe is but an artificial world created by his fan tasy. If we do not want to agree with this we must recogn ise ourselves as beings of fo ur dimensions. This argu ment is neat, and it has a superfic ial charm , but why, in the name of the beyond itself? Why, if we do not possess the fo urth dimension do we not exist at all? Why, if we only exist in the mind of a iourth­ dimensional somebody, do we have no \"real\" existence ? To what does that \"real\" refer? In this passage Ouspensky was doing little more than summa rizing Hinton, and his personal assu mptions remain hidden. The fourth dimension had the attrac tive ness of seeming to \"prove \" his intuitions Scientifica lly, and this probably meant a great deal to the self-taught philosophe r. Under the stimulus of his mystical experiences and with the background of oc cult theory which his reading had given him, Ouspensky set out to resolve his personal equati on. Being a clear writer, a man with heart, and in a condition of near ecstasy while he did so, he produced a remarkable solution."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"5 The Search for the Miraculous A story told by Boris Mour avieff epitomizes the world into which Ouspensky let himself with the key of Tertium Organum .

He has been criticized for his choice of a title: Tertium Organum, the Third Canon of Thought, because it seemed that he was placing his work on a level higher than the Organon of Aristotle and the Novum Organ um of Francis Bacon-the first two canons of thought which the third canon supplements . This is a misunderstanding, which Ouspensky did his best to dispel in a letter published in G. R. S. Mead's magaz ine, The Quest, ten years after the book was written. \"By my title,\" he wrote, \"I simply intended to say that a much deeper and larger understanding of the possibilities of logic had existed far earlier than the narrow frames given us by Aristotle and Bac on, in which almost all subsequent thought has been confined leaving that which could not be there included as illogical .\" The Russian word, which was eventually translated as \"canon,\" means \"weapon\" or \"instr umen t,\" and Ouspensky's book was intended to show how habitual patterns of thought-particularly those created by the development of material ist science-have imprisoned thought itself. In his view, human consc iousness had voluntarily limited the territory in which it could exercise itself-when beyond its cramped backyard was an entire coun­ tryside in which to rove and the prospect of the noumenal world beyond the hills. According to Ouspensky, positivist philosophy denied the existence of certain facts- facts like those he was personally experiencing. The need was for a new system of logic, in which he declared that \"Science must come to mystici sm.\" His starting point was Kant's proposition about how man perceives the world; that \"the things which we intuit are not in themselves the same as our represent ation of them in intuition .\" What do we know, and '�do we know it? The uncertainties implicit in the idea that our perception of the world cannot be said to correspond to things as they are allows infinite scope for discussing the possibilities of how things are in fact. It was here that the fourth dimension came in. Ouspensky took his stand on the theories of C. H. Hinton, an Englishman whose Scientific Romances , ( 1884-1904) provided H. G. Wells with the idea of the time machine. Ouspensky's own Ivan Osokin may have been inspired by Hinton's stories based on the idea of recurren ce; and it was Hinton's fate to provide material for others to work on. His hooks A New Era of Thought (1888) and The Fourth Dimension (1904) argued that man apprehended reality by means of .space. \"Space is the instrument of the mind.\" Hinton postulated a fourth ilimension of all apparently three-dim ensional ob jects, claiming that it was merely the structure of the human mind which prevented man from perceiving the fourth dimensioq. He even declared that it was possible to educate the senses into making out a four-dimensional cube-the tesser act-by means of complicated stacks of ordinary cubes with their"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE surf aces specially colore d. Exerci ses with Hinton's cubes became popular in Theosophical circl es. Ouspensky's experi ments had given him the vision of the Long Body of man. He now used this insight to argue that the fo urth dimension was Time. A point in motion becomes a line, a line in motion becomes the two­ dimensional plane surface, and a plane surface in motion creates a cube of three dimensions. Man in motion-not walking from one place to another in three-dimensional space, but man moving through life, through his personal time-is a being of fo ur dimensions: in his Long Body. Ouspensky thought that h�s experiments had induced the experience of higher spa ce. Higher dimensions could be appr ehended , but they must not be thought of as geomet rical dimension s. If space , as Hinton argued, were an instrument of the mind, two different fo rms of space-th ree- and fo ur-dimensional­ were two differing modes of conscio usness, \"two methods of receptivity of one and the same unique world of a space which is unique .\" Here the illumination which had flashed across Ouspensky's mind and had so puzzled him took on its full significance : \"think in other categori es.\" \"It is necessary to underst and ,\" he wrote , \"that all objects known to us exist not only in those categories in which they are perceived by us, but in an infinite number of others in which we do not and cannot sense them. And we must learn first to think things in other catego ries, and then so far as we are able, to imagine them there in. Only after doing this can we possibly develop the faculty to apprehend them in higher space-and to sense 'higher' space itsel f. \" The problem theref ore remained the develop ment of higher fo rms of consci ousness. Proc eeding by analogy, Ouspensky considered how worlds of higher dimensions would appear to beings of one and two dimensions only. This was a line of argu ment deriving from the celebrated book, Flatland, published in 1884 by Dr. E. A. Abbott, a famous preacher and the hea dmaster of the Ci� of London School, who had himself been inspired by Hinton. Abbott described, fo r example , how a squar e--a being of two dimension s-was visited by a sphe re-a being of three dimensions -who appeared to the perception of the flatlander to be a circle . Ouspensky applied this analogy to the diff erences he fo und between animal and human conscio usness. He decided that the space sense of an animal might be two­ or even one-dimensional, and concluded that if the existence of lower space senses than the human could be demon strated it must fo llow that a higher consci ousness was also possible. Ouspensky now brought into his argument support from mathematics and occult ism. On the one hand, Einstein and Minkovski were called in to reinforce the idea of the relevance of the fo urth dimension to human consci ousness; and on the other, H. P. Blavatsky and"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 121 lesser Theosophists testified in Ouspens ky's favor about the nature of the world beyond appearance s. On this foundation, Ouspensky erected a vision of the world as a gigantic hieroglyph which must be decoded. This was very much the concept of the Symbolists, but Ouspensky's interpretation of the symbols was based on his own mystical experiments. He repeated the Platonic myth of the cave; and maintained that in art, and particularly in sex, there were hints of the sunlit world beyond the cavern. He analyzed the various habits of thought and language which trapped man in a three-dimensional universe, and discussed the possibility of higher consciousness as described in Hindu literature. His own experience combined with his wide reading to convince Ouspensky that the nature of the real world was known to the mystics. The attainment of higher consciousness might be described as \"unity with the all.\" He printed long extracts from Orthodox and Theosophical anthologies of mysticism, and made great use of the works of William James and the American Transcenden­ talist Dr. R. M. Bucke's Cosmic Consciousness (1905). He was particularly concerned to point out the complete illogicality of mystical experiences. 'They are super-logical, i.e., Tertium Orga num, WHICH IS THE KEY TO MYSTICAL EXPER IENCE, is applicable to them in all its entirety.\" In one important way Ouspensk y differed from the Theosophical authors whose books he so freely used. They were mostly content to see the evolution of humanity toward higher consciousness as a process occupying millennia. Ouspensky mistrusted the theory of evolution and had the urgency of his own experience to impel a devotion to Nietzsche. \"The future belongs not to man, but to superma n, who is already born and lives among us. A higher race is rapidly emerging among humanity, and it is � inerging by reason of its quite remarkable underst anding of the world and of life.\" Tertium Organum is an extraordinary book, giving the impression of having been written at white heat. Many devotees of Ouspensky still find it the best piece of work he ever did, and it was certainly the book which made his reputation. It is lucidly written and, in the best sense of the word, \"liberat ing.\" Ouspen sky's central theme of the artificial limitations imposed by accepted categories on human consci ousness is important and con­ Vinc ing; and whether his analogies with higher dimensions of spac� are in any sense more than analogies does not matter at all. Neither does it matter that in at least two places, his argument is very shaky indeed. His section on the mathematics of infinite magnitudes does not stand up to scrutiny.

Ouspensky did not claim great originality; rat her, he claimed to have rephrased a truth known to all men of \"cosmic conscio usness\" fr om time immemorial. \"In the world's literature there exist books , usually little known ,\" he wrote , \"which accidentally or by design may happe� to be assembled on one shelf in one library. Th ese, taken togethe r, will yield so clear and complete a picture of human existence, its path and its goal, that there will be no further doubts about the destiny of humanity . . . .\" The experience of the beyond had been a catalyst. The various authors whom he had been so avidly studying seemed to unite their voic es, and Ouspensky saw connecti ons. \"Books are appearing which it is impossible to refer to any acce pted library clas sificat ion, which it is impossible to 'enroll' in any fa culty. These books are the fo rerunners of a new literature which will break down all fe nces built in the region of thought ... \" His ac cumulated experience broke , reordered itsel f, and ref ormed into meaning . The fa ct that his sources were fa miliar reading to the mystically inclined intel­ ligentsia of Europe meant that his book would itself have something of the effect on its readers that Ouspensky's private experiences had had on him. The vortex in which swirled Nietzsche, occul tism, and a dissatisf action with the scientific pundits might resolve itself fo r a reader, as it had fo r the author, and the buyers of Tertium Organum themselves would perceive the connections which Ouspensky had fo und in a flash of enlightenm ent. Not only had Ouspensky achieved the ref ormation of experience which is the mark of all good litera ture, but he had eliminated fr om his sources the more crazy occult vaporin gs: had cracked the code and translated the aspirat ions of the occultists into ordinary speech . It is this fac tor of clarity and reinterpretation which distinguishes Tertiu m Organum from similar productions of the Russian mystical intelligents ia. But even in the second edition of 1916, fr om which the first English translation was made, Tertiu m Organum remains very much the book of a Russi an intellectual. For exam ple, there are the inev itable quotations from Vladimir Soloviev, who began the whole religious reVival ; and Ouspensky's"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 123 thoughts on \"Occultism and Love\" are heavily influenced by Vasily Rozanov, that satyrlike prophet of the cosmic orgas m. Originally the book also contained a lengthy refutation of the sexual ideas of the eccentric Polish guru Wincenty Lutoslaws ki, which was later excised. Ouspensky concluded Tertium Organum with a quotation from Revelations in which an angel proclai ms that \"there shall be time no longer.\" He had found the passage in a book by the poet Alexander Dobrolyubov, a hero of the mystical Russian intellig entsia, who after his expulsion from Moscow University had set off to wander round Russia with his body encased in iron hoops , like certain Orthodox holy men. For all the inspiration of Tertium Organum, it was part of a recognizable tradition, and its arguments become more, not less impressive, when allowance is made for the particular pressures of time and place . In 1912 the book was published, and the next year Ouspensky succeeded in persuading three of the newspapers for which he worked to finance a journalistic trip to India. A journey to the East had become increasingly important for him, for the results of his mystical experiments were neither complete enough nor permanent. He noted \"the helplessness that I feel in the face of the wall behind which I can look for a moment, but never long enough to account to myself for what I see.\" He vacillated uneasily between the feeling that he must delay no longer in making experiments with fasting or meditational techniq ues, and the idea that he should abandon further attempts at occult practice until he knew what he was doing. Despite the tremendous power behind the revelation of Tertium Orga num, he had been forced to end the book on a note of interrogati on. \"The meaning oflife is in eternal search . And only in that search can we find something truly new.\" H:is own search reverted to the pursuit of hidden wisdom. Occult literature made him think that he might find men who knew among the Hindu yogis or the Sufis of Islam. \"The question of school and of a method acquires for me a predominant significance , though it is still not clear and connected with too many fantasies and ideas based on very doubtful theori es,\" he wrote later. \"But. one thing I see clearly, that alone, , by myself, I can do nothing .\" He needed help. Ouspensky is quite open about the \"fantasies\" in which he indulged when he set off to the East. The trouble was that the third weapon of thought was a two-edged sword. It could cleave a passage through the cobwebs of materia lism; but just because Tertium Organum so satisfactorily destroyed accep ted logic, it opened the way to a state of mind where anything was possible . \"Let us remember, \" Ouspensky had written, \"that the world of causes is the world of the marvellous; that what appears simple to us can never be real. The real appears to us as the marvello us.\" He left fo r India in"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"124 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE the hopes of penetrating to the real world-the life beyond life. He said he was going to the East \"in search of the miracul ous.\" I could not explain it clearly, but it seemed to me that even the beginning of contact with a school may have a miraculous nature . I imagined, for example, the possibility of making contact with schools of the distant past, with schools of Pythago ras, with schools of Egypt, with the schools of those who built Notre Dame, and so on. It seemed to me that the barriers of time and space should disappear on making such a contact. The idea of schools in itself was fantastic and nothing seemed to me too fantastic in relation to this idea. Despite the discourage ment of clever men in St. Petersburg who scoffed at the idea of the mysterious East, Ouspensky set off on his occult quest. The universe of the miraculous was only a hairsbreadth away, and anywhere he might find the rent in the fabric which kept him from it. He had planned to go with his friend and traveling compan ion, Sherbakov, but Sherbakov died just before he set out. On the journey, Ouspensky twice heard his voice speak to him. He was thrown back on his Theosophical contacts . From Russia he traveled to London where he met A. R. Orage, the editor of the influent ial magazine, the New Age; and possibly he also met Mme. Blavatsky's old secretary, G. R. S. Mead. It was probably in connection with Ouspensky's visit to London that Mme. A. L. Pogossky-who kept a shop in Bond Street which sold Russian arts and crafts and was prominent in Russian Theoso­ phy-made an English translation of his book, The Symbolism of the Tarot. This was published in English in St. Petersburg in 1913 and introduced in Ouspensky's name to the English-sp eaking public. From London the seeker continued to Paris, where he reflected on the esoteric schools of masons who he believed had built Notre Dame. Next, he went to Genoa, where an active branch of the Theosophical Society was headed by the German-Italian botanist, Professor OUone Penzig. From Genoa he took ship for Cairo where he stayed for three weeks and visited the Pyramids almost daily. Then to Ceylon, where his quest proper began. He arrived in the East, if anything, more elated than when he had set out, for his journey appeared to provide confirmation of his new beliefs. In Tertium Organum he had proclaimed: \"On earth there are living two different species of men. The possibility of the appearance or development of cosmic consciousness is the distinguishing mark of one of these species­ numerically small. In the other, infinitely more numerous, cosmic con­ sci ousness does not appear, and can never appear.\" The embryo Supermen were already able to recognize one another and might soon assume their"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"TH E SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 125 responsibilti es : \"a new race CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF ... will judge the old races .\" As he tra veled through Europe among his Theosophical fr ie nds, Ouspensky discovered all ar ound him hints that his prophecy was coming tr ue. The European intelligents ia- particularly of a Theosophic al sort­ fo rmed the nucleus of a new order: St. Petersburg, London , Paris, Genoa, Cairo, Colombo, Galle , Madras, Benar es, Calcutta, were connected by invisible threads of common hopes and common expectatio n. And the more people I met, the more this side of my journey took hold of me. It was as though there grew out of it some secret society, having no na me, no fo rm, no conventional la ws, but closely connected by community of ideas and langua ge. I often thought of what I myself had written in Tertium Organum about people of a \"new Race .\" And it seemed to me that I had not been fa r from the truth , and that there is actually carried on the proce ss of the fo rmation , if not of a new race , at least of some new ca tegory of men, fo r whom there exist diff erent values than fo r other people . In Ceylon he stayed at a hotel on the seashore near Colombo, and tr aveled throughout the island . He visited bhikkus and made inquiries into Buddhis m, convinced that behind what seemed to him an \"arid and materia listic\" theory of liberation fr om suff ering, there lay an esoteric Buddhism concerned with the methods of atta ining enlight enment. He was less concerned with doctrine than with the world of the miraculo us. a subj ect which official Buddhism had apparently made ta boo. The intellec­ tualism of his Buddhist acquaintances irritated him beyond measure . Where was the miracul ous, the center of all religions ? He sensed that nevert heless there was something there, something, overshadowing; there the gap in the curtain, the intrusion of the miracle into the world . . . . And then he fo und it. In a small temple near Colombo there was an image of the Buddha with sapphire eyes. It seemed that the image was not locally considered remarka ble, and it was not mentioned in any of the guideboo ks. Ouspensky was led to it only after lengthy circumambulations around the sights more fav ored by tourists, and his garrulous guide eventually left him alone before the shrine . \"A second or two passed, and I understood that I was in the presence of a miracle .... The Buddha saw me, saw in me that which I could not see mysel f, all that was hidden in the most secret rece sses of my soul. And under his gaze •. which as it were passed me by, I began to see all this mysel f. \" It was like the picture of the Great Ma gician he had drawn in"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"126 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE his pen portraits of the Tarot cards : \"1 saw myself reflected in him as in a mirror and in his eyes 1 seemed to look upon myself.\" The gaze of the sapphire eyes ordered and calmed the inner disquiet of the beholder, conf erred enlightenment and understanding. The learned bikkhus were irrelevant to his quest. The miraculous was there . . . there . . . and there, if only the trick could be learned of breaking out fr om this heavy matter which so imprisoned and oppressed the soul. From Ceylon the tra veler went on to Madras and stayed fo r six weeks at Adyar, the headquarters of the Theosophical Society . This was a tra ditional place of pilgrimage fo r Westerners in search of enlig htenment. In 1913 the birds of passage numbered, besides Ouspensky, the Baltic Count Keyser­ ling on the journey around the world which he recorded in his Travel Diary of a Philosopher; Carl Bechhof er Robe rts, who was in search of Mahatmas and was warned by a Brahman visitor to Adyar agai nst the moral corruption of his hosts; and the enigmatic figure of Boris Soloviev , who later married the daughter of Rasputin and played a dubious role in the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his fa mily at Ekaterin burg. J. G. Bennett records Ouspensky's story of the pecking order at Adyar: on the ground Hoor of the headquarters building were the hang ers-on and those Theosophically of no acco unt; above them lived the pillars of the Society's fu nds and organiza­ tion; on the top Hoor was the esoteric group-to which Ouspensky was at once admitted. His stay does not seem to have impressed him, although he was not yet quite weaned fr om Theosophical ideas . A book just published when he arrived at Adyar, Johann van Manen's Some Occult Experiences, fo und a place in the second edition of Tertium Organum; and soon after he left Adyar, he met the Theosophist Bhagavan Das at Benares and discovered striking similarities to his own thought in Das's book, The Science of Peace . Ouspensky preserved till the end of his lif e a respect fo r the earlie st Theosophical literat ure, but his verdict on later Theosophy-in particular his scathing comments on Bishop Leadbeate r's technicolored descriptions of the astral world-have the Havor of a man con demning the illusions of his youth. His ideas of the miraculous were chan ging, and his contact with some of the more futile aspects of Indian Theosophy was probably one of the reasons fo r this cha nge. \"Beginning with a bold, revolutionary search fo r the wondr ous,\" he wrote shortly after, \"theosophy soon started to fa ll away fr om that and to stop at some 'found' truths which it gradually converted into indisputable dogmas .\" His own search fo r men in possession of esoteric knowledge continued. He visited many of the established gurus , the fo llowers of Ramakrishna among them. By all of these he was dissat isfied. \"Sc hools\" perhaps they we re, but not what he was looking fo r. Later, on his way back fr om India,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 127 he analyzed his feelings. The frankly devotional schools were useless, for he could have found many such religious \"ways\" in Russia. There were schools based on yogic exercises, about which he already knew something, but these he mistrusted because they depended on the creation of trance states. This smacked to him of spiritua lism, and suggested possibilities of self­ deception. He met \"nice people\" connected with schools like the Ramakri shna Vedanti sts, but did not feel they possessed \"real knowledge .\" There remained rumors of schools with which he could not make personal contact; schools which appeared to have real knowledge, but which made extraordinary demands on the pupil. If he had submitted himself to such a school, he would have had to stay in India and make a clean break with his former life. This he did not want to do. Then the miraculous intruded again. At the beginning of the rainy season in the summer of 1914, Ouspensky left Bombay for Agra and Delhi. A visit by moonlight to the Taj Mahal continued his pilgrimage to those holy and enigmatic places where he might decode the hieroglyph of the world . The point about the hieroglyph-the point about the whole Symbolist approach-was that one never knew exactly when the numinous would reveal its overshadowing presence. The cab horse on the Nevsky, or the Buddha with the sapphire eyes; the mundane and the sublime might equally reveal universal truths. \"A grain of sand can become a system of the astral world,\" one Russian Symbolist had written, and Ouspensky's vision of the new consciousness which he saw developing was greatly influenced by this attitude . In The Symbolism of the Tarot, he tried to describe the shift in perception , the apprehension of meanings , that slantwise, squinting vision which suddenly becomes clarity itself. \"Symbolism cannot be learned as one learns to build bridges or speak a foreign language ,\" he wrote, \"and for the interpretation of symbols a special cast of mind is necessary; in addition to knowledge , special faculties, the power of creative thought and a developed imagination are required .\" The Tarot, like nature itself, contained 'all potential meanings .' Meanings suddenly composed themselves out of this fabric and the very existence of the Taj Mahal. As Ouspensky sat and gazed at the luminous shape of the great building, the scent of jasmine in his nostrils and the cries of peacocks in his ears, he had only a brief warning-a sense of two worlds existing concurren tly­ before the miraculous broke through . In a flash of insight, he solved the riddle of the Taj Mahal. He experienced \"the wonderful joy of liberation , as if I had come out into the light from some deep underground passage .\" The Taj Mahal represented the secret of death. From where he sat, he saw the small light burning W ithin the building above the tomb of the Empress Mumtaz-i-Mahal. This tiny glow, so feeble and so transitory, was"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE the petty life of man on earth. The graceful, shining edifice which enclosed it represented eternal life, which was the same thing as saying \"the soul.\" Suddenly there was revealed to Ouspensky the hidden meaning of the Sufi builders of the mausoleum-he was surrounded by the soul of the Empress, which merged with creation just as the Taj Mahal itself, enclosing the Empress's body, seemed to flow into the sky and the surrounding gardens. Ouspensky understood that the soul of man was not contained in his physical body, but that \"the body lives and moves in the soul.\" The insight was so important to him and seemed so profound that he afterward felt incapable of giving it adequate expression. The rest of his nocturnal visit confirmed the impression that the Taj Mahal was a Sufi allegory . He marveled at its workmanship and rejoiced at the way in which the architecture returned countless echoes of the shout of \"Allah!\" repeating \"for ever, the name of God.\" The next day he visited the gardens again, and saw in the spectacle of all sorts and conditions of men mingling around the tomb part of the grand symbolism of its designers who had wished to demons trate the unity of all things. \"As above, so below.\" Toward the end of 1914, Ouspensky returned to Ceylon by ship from Madras. He expected to find out whether his newspapers wanted him to return to Russia or to continue his journey to the Far East and America. Also, his search for the custodians of esoteric knowledge seemed on the point of bearing fruit, and he hoped to find in Colombo an acquaintance who had offered to introduce him to \"certain Yogis.\" Instead, he was met on landing by the news of the outbreak of the First World War, and all his plans were disrupted. The war meant that Ouspensky could not continue his search and had to postpone other journeys he had planned in Russian Central Asia and the Middle East. On his return trip, during which he spent several weeks on London, he found himself infected by the war fever. \"Everything I had thought about the results of my search was thrown into confusion by the wild absurdity of the war and by all the emotions which filled the air, conversation and newspapers, and which, against my will, often affected me.\" But when at last he reached St. Petersburg through Norway, Sweden, and Finland, his old associati ons revived. He agam. felt that his search for the miraculous was more important than the hysterias of politician s, and the war began to assume a particular significance in the universe of four­ dimensi onal logic. In the first place, it explained to Ouspensky why he had felt it necessary to hurry in his search for the miraculous. At the same time the reality of war, death, and destruction provided an ominous reminder of the necessity of hurry in the future \"and that it was impossible to believe in 'life' which led nowhere .\""},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 129 There was an even more sinister significance which Ouspensky described in a story . \"The Benevolent Devi l,\" published in the early days of the war. The story uses his Indian travels as a backg round, and begins with the narrat or's encounter with the devil in the cave temples of Ellora. In a manner which C. S. Lewis was to popularize in The Screwtape Letters, the devil describes the various shifts to which his infernal brethren are put to keep mankind from attain ing knowledge of the real world beyond the world of matter. \"The kingdom of matter is eternal !\" shouts the devil, and he explains how certain magical , transcendental or religious ideas constitute the chief danger to diabolic domina tion of mankind. As an illustration of his methods, he takes the case of a young Englishman called Leslie White, whom the narrator of the story has met in Ceylon. Ouspen sky-who loathed Englishmen of the type he imagined to be the Kipling variety and indeed he seems sometimes never to have understood the English at all­ describes Leslie White as a type most uncommon in India: one WilO fraternizes with the Indians, and is fascinated by Buddhism; but he has attached to him a personal devil, whose task is to distract his mind from his transcendental interests. Whenever Leslie White determines to meditate or to study Buddhism, the devil suggests he go sailing, or attend a social engag ement or most particularly-and there may be something of self­ analysis here--that he eat a large Indian meal. Unfortunately fo r his devil, Leslie White may fa ll by the ways ide, but he always picks himself up again, and at the end of the devil's tale is not only living on a meager diet but has made contact with other seekers like himself. The existence of large numbers of such people aggravates the devil, and he leaves the narrator of the story hinting that he will be fo rced t& use \"special methods\" against them . What these methods are is revealed at the end of the story, when the narrator is in London and sees Leslie White march past in the street at the head of a Scottish regiment. \"'What has Leslie retained from Yoga, from Buddhism?' I asked myself. Now he must think, feel, and live like a Roman legionnaire , whose duty is to defend the Eternal City from barbarians. An entirely different world , another psychology. Now all these refinements of thought seem an unnecessary luxury . Probably he has already fo rgotten about them, or will soon forget.\" ''The Benevolent Devil\" expre sses its author's bitter disappo intment that the select band he had imagined capable of cosmic consci ousness was to be dispersed and its possibilities shattered by the brute nature of war. At the end of the story Ouspensky's self breaks in: \"What chance had they now of recogni sing each other? ... I now felt the possibility for any kind of mutual �nderstanding had been shattered for some time ahead .\" As for the devil, who appears both in this story and in \"The Inventor, \" which was published with it in an edition of 1916, he is of course no"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"130 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE fundamentalist creation. Ouspensky makes it clear, both in the story and in his pen portrait of the card, \"The Devil\" in the Tarot pack, that his \"devil\" is created by man himself. \"I am the Evil which men say is the cause of all evil,\" says the Tarot Devil, \"and which they invented as an excuse for all the evil that they do. They call me the Prince of Falsehood, and truly I am the Prince of Lies, because I am the most monstrous creation of human lies.\" In ''The Benevolent Devil,\" Leslie White disappears from his tormentor's vision when he is immersed in higher things, dreaming romantically of a girl, or even reading with full absorption . \"To get away from reality means to get away from the devil.\" For Ouspensky's search for a life beyond life had led him to deny the existence of byt altogether. In the prologue to the story, the narrator dreads a sleepless night which will give him the sensation he calls \"immersion in matter.\" Ouspensky's occult reading had led him to a Gnostic viewpoint from which he proclaimed that man must free himself from \"Great Matter,\" and in the 1916 Tertium Orga num, the world of matter is equated with the \"unreal\" world of three-dimensional consciousness which prevents knowl­ edge of infinity beyond . \"To feel this infinity it is necessary to understand the unreality of everything material and factual, and the reality of fantasy and the world of the imaginati on. The material world does not exist .\" The Great War represented the victory of the devil in man, and the immersion of European civilization in Great Matter. The imperatives of survival would prevent the birth of the new race which Ouspensky had so confidently expected. The war-\" the great European war in the possibility of which I had not wanted to believe, and the reality of which I did not for a long time wish to acknowledge \"-was evidently a blow which he took almost personally . At the same time his year in India had rid him of many of the illusions with which he had started out. No longer did he indulge in fantasies of contact with esoteric schools \"on another plane.\" He saw that these were mere daydreams, and although he was more than ever convinced that there was something to be found in the East, he saw that his search must be directed toward schools whose masters were 8esh and blood. Neither had he discovered \"facts\"-concrete evi­ dence of the miraculous-which would give substance to the legendary miracles of Hind. He had hoped to see mass hypnosis exercised by practitioners of the Indian rope trick, but had found only some uninterest­ ing conjurers in Ceylon. At Benares on the Ganges, he had met a fakir who for a single rupee lay on his bed of nails atld allowed himself to be photogra phed; but Ouspensky found nothing in the \"dull, bored and indifferent expression\" of the man to indicate that he practiced his painful art as a fOTIli of religious asceticism. Yet the search for the miraculous remained his motive passion. It now"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE SEARCH FOR THE MIRACULOUS 131 proceeded with slightly diff erent premises, but Ouspensky was still in pursuit of what he called \"fa ct s.\" He had as inalienable possessions the fa cts he had already discovered. His mystical ex perience s, the inquisition of the Buddha with the sapphire eyes, and the revelation of the Taj Mahal, were after all more important than the lunacies of politician s. And if the war had broken the links which held together the chain of the new race, it had also given a powerful impulse to the traditional aspirations of Holy Russia. Ouspensky's quest suddenly become relevant to many others who took the war \"as a gigantic memento mon.\" He had confirmation of this soon after his return. For six weeks he worked in Moscow fo r one of the newspapers which had sent him abroad . Then he went to St. Petersburg whe re, in February and March 1915, he gave lectures on his travels in the hall of the Town Duma. The titles of these lectures were , \"In Sea rch of the Mir aculous ,\" and \"The Problems of Deat h. \" At each lecture, his audience numbered over a thousa nd. He was besieged by letters and ca llers, and \"I fe lt,\" he wro te, \"that on the basis of a 'search fo r the mir acu lous' it would be possible to unite together a very large number of people who were no longer able to swallow the customary fo rms of lying and living in lyi ng.\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"6 The Inner and the Outer Revo lutions Soon after Easter 1915, Ouspensky traveled to Moscow to repeat his succe ss as a lectur er. As a result, he met Pohl and Mer kouroff, who told him of a mysterious Caucasian Greek who directed an \"occult\" group in M$scow. In his new critical attitude toward the occult, Ouspensky was not impr essed by the rather Theosophical mira cles of which they told him: these seemed \"all sorts of self -suggested wonders .\" He only agreed to meet Gurd jieff after Merkouroff 's \"persistent eff orts .\" This is importa nt, becau se it shows that Gurd jieff was out to catch Ous pensky. If so, he was far from the only disciple whom Gurdjieff deliberately ensnared. Glimpses of the Truth represents Gurdjieff as urging his friend \"P\" -perhaps Pohl-to draw the narrator out on esoteric sub jects , in order to discover whether they had any real meaning fo r him.

Ouspensky's doubts were dissipated by his first meeting with Gur dj ieff. They were replaced by other doubts , of a quite novel sort. Gurd jieff answered his questions precisely and neither stumbled nor prevaricate d. But there were some strange inconsistenc ies. Ouspensky's description of this first encounter is probably the most fa mous portrait of Gurdjieff: We arrived at a small cafe in a noisy though not cen tral street. I saw a man of an oriental type , no longer young, with a black must ache and piercing eyes, who astonished me first of all because he seemed to be disguised and completely out of keeping with the place and its atm osphere . I was still full of impressions of the East. And this man with the fa ce of an Indian raja or an Arab sheik whom I at once seemed to see in a white burnoose or a gilded turban, seated here in this little cafe , where small dealers and commission age nts met togethe r, in a black overcoat with a velvet collar and a black bowler hat, produced the strange, unexpected, and almost ala rming impression of a man poorly disguised, the sight of whom embarr asses you because you see he is not what he pretends to be and yet you have to speak and behave as though you did not see it. He spoke Russian incorrectly with a strong Caucasian ac cent; and this acce nt with which we are ac customed to associate anything apart from philos.ophical ideas , strengthened still further the strang eness and the unexpecte dness of this impression. They talked of Ouspensky's travels and his interest in narcoti cs. Then they went together to a meeting of Gurd jieff's pupi ls, which was to take pla ce, Ouspensky gath ered, in an apartment which had caused Gurdjieff great exp ense, as was only fitting fo r an undertaking in which many \"prof essors\" and \"arti sts\" were concern ed. Gurd jieff refused to say pre­ cisely who ampng the intelligentsia were intrigued by his work; and it emerged that the meeting was to be held in the sort of barely furnished flat Ouspensky recognized as probably belonging to a mun icipal school\\eac her, with an audience drawn fr om the poverty-stricken lesser intellectua ls. He was read the story, Glimpses of Truth, and noticed a ref erence to The Struggle of the Magic ians, which he too had seen advertised in the pres s. About the actual work which went on in the group he could learn little . Gurdjieff had said that it was something to do with chemistry, and the schoolteacher types talked indefinitely of \"work on onese lf. \" Despite the absence of the prof essors and arti sts, and despite Gurd jieff's refusal to identify the \"f amous danc ers\" who would appear in his ballet, Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLUT IONS 135 was fa scinated by the evening.

For the next week he continued to meet Gurd jieff in the same shabby cafe . He rapidly came to see that Gurd jieff deliberately created unf av orable conditions fo r such conversat ions, and that over ideas which Ouspensky fe lt to be prof oundly true would take pains to spread a gloss of apparent shiftine ss. For exam ple, they were tal king about money. Gurdjieff said that his fe e fo r a year's work was a thousand roubl es. To Ouspensky this seemed a large sum fo r someone who did not have private means. Gurd jieff replied that he could not have many pupils and ought not to spend his own money on \"the wor k.\" People who could not provide such a sum, he said , were probably weak in lif e and ther ef ore might be weak in the work . Knowledge was not valued unless it was paid fo r. Ouspensky assented to all these propo sition s, yet with a sense that Gurdjieff was overacting a part. \"I was surprised at G.' s apparent desire to convince me of something in connection with the question of money when I needed no convincing .\" When the week was past, Ouspensky returned to St. Petersburg where he had to prepare books fo r the press, including a new edition of Tertium Organum and his Occult Tales . Gurdjieff had let him know that he sometimes traveled to St. Petersburg and would contact Ouspensky if he did come. The war went badl y, and Ouspensky buried himself in his work, consoling himself that if necessary , he could always go to Gur dj ieff. Then in the autu mn of 1915 he was telephoned by Gurdjieff, who was on one of his periodic visits from Moscow. From this renewal of contact with the man who had almost imperceptibly become his Master, sprang the \"St. Petersburg gro up,\" a group whose activi ties during the next eighteen months are chronicled by Ouspensky. The internal revolution which he records was paral leled with an extrao rdinary exactn ess by the events of the outer world. It was Ouspensky who was chiefly responsible fo r creating Gurd jieff's fo llowing in St. Petersburg. In 1937 he told his pupils that there had been an explicit understanding that he should screen prospective recr uits.

An acco unt of this period has recently been published which bears out the impression that Gurdjieff was using Ouspensky as his second-in-command and fr ont man. This acco unt is by Anna Butkovsky , who had become Ouspensky's close companion even before his journey to India. She had met him at a meeting of the St. Petersburg Theosophical Society, and soon fo und herself at the center of the group of mystically inclined intellectuals who met at The Stray Dog. She ac companied Ouspensky and Volynsky on their nocturnal sorties through St. Petersburg, during which Ouspensky would enlarge on the theme of the \"search fo r the miraculou s,\" a topic to which he returned in daylight in Phillipoff 's Cafe on the Nevsky Prospekt, not far fr om his own apa rtments. After Ouspensky's meeting with Gurdj ieff, Anna Butkovsky fo und herself rapidly introduced to this intriguing figure whom Ouspensky believed might lead them both to what he had fa iled to find in India. Around the pair of them and their teacher a group began to fo rm, which met to listen to Gurd jieff in Phillipoff 's Caf e. First there were Ouspensky and Anna Butkov sky, the \"fav orite pupi ls ,\" although neither of them exempt fr om the Master's stinging rebukes. Then Anthony Chark ovsky, an engineer in his fiftie s, and a younger engineer named Andrei Z-- . Next there was Dr. Leonid Stoerneval , a Finnish specia list in mental illness who may have arrived in Gurd jieff' s circle independent of Ouspensky. Stoerneval had interests in hypnotism which may have resulted in some earlier contact with Gur dj ieff, fo r whom he harbored an almost fan atical devotion, \"almost slave-like ,\" his wif e reports . He was second only to Ouspensky in drumming up recrui ts. An elderly patient of his made up the sixth of the Phillipoff 's group which Gurd jieff seems to have regarded as his inner circle . Meet ings were held in Stoerneval's house, in the homes of his patien ts, and occasionally in the Finnish dacha of one particularly well-off lady , a Madame Maximovitch . By January 1916, thirty to fo rty people had ga thered, and Gurd jieff began to visit St. Petersburg regularly, sometimes with pupils fr om his Moscow grou ps. Among Gurd jieff's pupils at this time, two important figures remain puzzling. One of th6Se is the lady who became Mme. Ouspen sky-Sophia Grigorievna. Very little is known about her. She wAs born in 1874 and was twice marri ed. The first marriage was to a student when she was sixte en, and the second was to a mining engineer with whom she traveled to remote areas of Russia. She had a son who was killed comparatively early in lif e, and a daughter old enough to provide Ouspensky with a step-grandchild in 1919. Ouspensky brought her to Gurd jieff's teaching and she was alway s known in the West as \"Mme. Ouspensky\"; but it is doubtful that the pair were ever legally married. It is rumored that Gurdj ieff advised Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLU TIONS 137 strongly aga inst a marriage ; and a fiction may have been propagated in order to secure certain rights or privilege s fo r \"Mme. Ouspensky\" and her daughter during the chaos of civil war and emigra tion. The situation was generally known and accepted by their pupils in the 1920s; and the coup le's relationship became increasingly one of convenience. The other mysterious figure is the woman who was always known as Gurd jieff's \"wif e,\" although she kept her own name of Ostrowsky . Her early lif e is a complete blank . J. G. Bennett claims that she was \"a noble Polish lady fr om the Imperial cour t,\" and the \"Polish\" at least is true if not the \"noble .\" There may be some ref erence to Mme. Ostrowsky in Gurd jieff's portrait of the Polish \"Mme. Vitvitskaya\" in Meetings with Remarkable Men. Vitvitskaya was a ref ormed prostitute and the de Hartmanns hint that Mme. Ostrowsky had a mixed and unhappy past. A legend used to circulate among Gurd jieff's disciples that she kept her own name because she wished to be considered as an ordinary pupil, rather than Gurd jieff's wif e; but other reasons spring to mind if we acce pt that Gurdjieff probably still had a wif e living somewhere in Central Asia. And far from being an ordinary pupil, Mme. Ostrowsky always occupied a privileged position in the Work and later often took leading roles in Gurd jieff's dance s. At first Gurd jieff's methods cau sed conf usion in St. Petersburg. He liked to spring meetings on his pupils at short notice . He would change his plans without warning; fo r exam ple, he might announce his imminent departure , then spend the whole day seeing pupils in caf es and decide at the last possible moment to hold a meeting. \". . . He considered that only by overco ming difficu lties, however irrelevant and aC cidental, could people . yalue his ideas ,\" wrote Ouspensky . The confusion was increased by the aCting which Ouspensky and his fr iends noticed in Gu rdj ieff. He would play, fo r exam ple, the part of a simple carpet seller, telling his pupils that dUring his Eastern tra vels he had ac quired a collection of carpets which could be disposed of most advanta geously in St. Petersbu rg-b ut other people said that he bought the carpets in Moscow and transported them to St. Petersburg to sell. Or he presided over huge dinners which earned him the reputation of a boll viveur -al though Ouspensky noticed that he ate little himsel f, and it was obvious to all his pupils that this was \"acting .\" Occas ionally his tactics seemed brazenly perve rse. The Ame rican art critic, Carl Zigro sser, has recorded a story of Gurd jieff at this period which Ouspensky told Orage . Ouspensky had arranged a lecture fo r Gurd jieff bef ore the Moscow Geog raphical Society. Gurd jieff lectured on the Gobi Desert with great authority and to great eff ect. Then he described how he had once discovered a valley whose sides were so steep that no one could reach the bott om. The valley Hoor was covered with diamonds, said"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"138 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurdj ieff , and the local inhabitants trained vultures wHy down to retrieve lumps of meat which they Hung down in the hopes that the diamonds would become embedded in th em. His learned audience was thrown into consternation- some suspecting simple fraud, others perhaps recognizing the tale from the Arabian Nights which Gurd jieff had repeated . The lecture turned into a fiasco. Gurd jieff explained to Ouspensky that he had seen that the valuable inf ormation which he had given the scholars was going unapprecia ted, so he decided to cast doubts on the whole substance of his talk. A lesson for the aca demics? Or a lesson fo r Ouspensky, the intellectual, jealous of his stan ding with his fe llows ? Under this unsettling tuition, the St. Petersburg group fe lt their way into the dense texture of Gurd jieff's ideas . Ouspensky recorded their struggles in In Search of the Miraculo us. The peculiar nature of In Search of the Miraculous has never been fully defined. It is a book which is both extraordinarily honest and extraordinarily decepti ve. Just before his death Gurdjieff was persuaded by his pupils to read Ouspensky's manuscript, and it is said that he pronounced blessings on his fo rmer disciple whom fo r years he had publicly vilified. The book is generally agreed to be an extremely scrupulous piece of reporting, and it can be approached as an accurate picture of what Gurdjieff taught in Russia in 1915-18. In Search of the Miraculous ref ers as much to Ouspensky as to Gur dj ieff. When the book was first published in 1950, a reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement remarked that \"this seems one of the rare cas es where the comme ntator proves almost more important than the subject of his observation s.\" We have what is one aspect of a unique examp le of the process of \"se lf-observation\" which plays such a large part in Gurd jieff's ideas . Gurd jieff mirrors Ouspensky, and Ouspensky reHects Gurdjieff. The Gurd jieff represented is called into being by his pupil: a Gurd jieff whose teaching was angled toward the mystical Russian intelligentsia and-from the poi nt of view of the o n]y record we possess -at Ouspensky in particular. The intensely personal nature of the record is emphasized by its tit le. Ouspensky always ref erred to his manuscript about his years with Gurd jieff as Fragments of an Unk nown Teaching, and this is the subtitle of the published book. But the full title is very significant. Ouspensky had published two series of sketches describing his Eastern trav els as In Search of the Miraculous: volumes I and II. To use the same title fo r his record of Gurd jieff's teaching is to place it where it belo ngs, in the historical sequence of Ouspensky's own search. This may seem a pedantic point, but it is important. \"I even thoug ht,\" says Ouspensky of the members of Gurd jieff's Moscow group, \"that it was very strange to meet them on the way to the miraculou s.\" In his first conversations with Gur dj ieff, Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OU TER REVOLUT IONS 139 spoke to him of his plans fo r returning to the Orient. '''It is good to go fo r a rest, fo r a holida y,' said G., 'but it is not worth while going there fo r what you wan t. All that can be fo und her e. '\" Ouspensky's record of what fo llowed is the record of his passage through the fire of Gurd jieff's purgative system. He embarked on this adventure as the logical con­ tinuation of his quest fo r suitable \"school s\" in the East. Because In Search of the Miraculous seems to be the cleare st existing account of Gurd jieff's teac hing, it is widely read , and some of the results have been very odd. The hieratic- religious tone which provided the background to Gurd jieff's talks belongs entirely to the Russian phase of his activity and is directed to the people among whom he was work ing. It belongs particularly to Ouspensky, whose personal preoccupations naturally influenced the questions he asked Gurd jieff and the items of Gurd jieff's conversation he snapped up. And the book is packed with ref erences to topics of quite transitory interest. How many readers will now recognize the reason for the talks on a universal language which have been fo und so significant? This almost certainly began with a ref erence to the artificial language, Esp eranto , devised by L. L. Zamenhof (1859 -1917). Zamenhof 's inspir ation came fr om the linguistic chaos of his birthplace on the Polish­ Russian frontier, and fr om about 1905, universal languages were matters of conce rn to the intelligentsia of all the Russias. Gurd jieff's skill immedi ately turned a topical question into a study of universals . There already existed three universal language s, he replied. They related to levels of being and understa nding. With questions of being and understanding, we move into the territory of Gurd jieff's ideas themselve s. They were released piecemeal, in a manner �liberately self -contradictory or misleading, and had to be fitted together by his pupils, and even completed by the pupils' investigati ons. Th is, together with Gurd jieff's ability never to seem the same person twi ce, gave rise to numerous disputes and misunde rstandi ngs. But despite the tantaliz­ ing, crab wise approach, the body of ideas which Gurd jieff gradually revealed presented a strange coherence . The group in St. Petersburg began to talk of \"the System .\" It comprised a cosmology , a psychology, ideas of evolution and the structure of matter-it seemed in a puzzling world to explain everything, and yet to lead to a point at which thought itself was annulled , and explanations became unnecessary. Step by step the pupils approached what the Gurd jieff of Glimpses of Truth calls \"the ab yss which can never be bridged by ordinary human reas on .\" Gurdj ieff was the Man Who Knows , and in In Search of the Miraculous, Ouspensky never quite conveys the intensity of a relati onship with such a superbeing. However, what he taught Ouspensky during 1916 and 1917 went something as folloW$:"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Man is asleep. He must wake up.

He must work on what Gurdjieff called \"consideri ng,\" which takes two fo rms. Internal considering is being concerned Or guided by what other people think of us, and is to be avoided.

There are other exerci ses fo r the other centers . Centers ? The structure of the human machine can be diagrammatically repr esented. Man, Gurdjieff began by saying, has three cente rs governing his activity: an intellectual center, an emotional center, and a moving center. These are located separately in the body and exist independently of each other. Later Gurd jieff was to refer to man as a \"three-brained bein g.\" It was part of work on oneself to harmonize the functioning of these hope lessly discordant cent ers. It became apparent that the description of three centers was one of convenience , fo r Gurdjieff eventually defined seven. The \"moving centre ,\" together with the \"insti nctive centre\" and the \"sex centre\" fo rm the \"centres of the lower story. \" Above the \"intellectual\" and \"emotional\" centers are the \"higher intellectual\" and \"higher emo­ tional\" centers, which represent functions present and perfectly developed in man, but which he does not know how to use. They can be used only by higher sorts of man. There are seven numbers of man. Man number one has his center of gravity in the moving center, man number two in the emotional center, and man number three in the intellectual center. These are the m en we know. Man number fo ur results from work in groups. He has begun to balance his centers and has a permanent center of gravity in his attachmen t to the work of self-develo pment. Men numbers one, two and three have no such permanent element in their being: all they consist of is a hundred little ''I's,'' each with its diff erent dema nds, likes and dislik es. At any moment \"Webb\" or \"Ivanov\" or \"Ouspensky\" can alter into \"Petrov\" or a stranger called, say, E. Hamilton Jones. Ordinarily, we \"identify\" with whichever imaginary '' 1 '' happens to be dominant. Men below man number fo ur have no \"1\"; just a multitude of conflicti ng tiny selves. But man number fo ur knows where he is going, and in man number five, the permanent attrib utes are becoming crystallized, fo r he has attai ned unity. Man number six is a less perfected fo rm of man number seven, \"who has reached the full development possible to man and who possesses everything a man can possess, that is, will, consci ousness, permanent and unch angeable 'I,' individuality, immortality, and many other prope rties, which in our blindness and ignorance , we ascribe to ourselves .\" The seven numbers of man repre sent a functioning of one of the two fundamental cosmic laws . These are the Law of Three and the Law of Seven. They operate both in the structure of the human machine and in the greater machine of the Univer se. The Law of Three is the working of the universe which creates all phenomena of wha tever orde r. \"Every phe-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"142 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE nomenon, on wha tever scale and in whatever world it may take place, is the result of the combination or meeting of three diff�rent and opposing fo rces.\" In relation to each othe r, these are expre ssed as active, passive and neutralizing forces, which Gurd jieff would later term \"Holy Affirming, Holy Denying, and Holy Reconc iling.\" In a man who wants to work on himself, said Gurdjieff, the Law of Three would manif est itself in the fo llOwing fas hion : his desire to work fo r a higher level of being fo rms the active fo rce; his habitual inertia and mechanicalne ss, the passively resisting second fo rce; and the reconciling aspect of the triad might be provided by new knowledge showing him the pressing need fo r such work and resolving the stalemate between his good intentions and his innate laziness. In the great machine of the universe, the Law of Three \"is a property of the real world.\" The Absolute , from which all creation emanat es, is composed of three fo rces-which give rise to such concepts as the Christian idea of the Trinity . The will of the Absolute creates worlds of a second order; and by the creative action of triads of ac tive, passive, and reco nciling fo rces, passes into worlds of different orders far removed from their source s. As the will of the Absolute is diffused further and fu rther along what Gurdjieff called the Ray of Creation, the number of mechanical laws to which created worlds are subject increas es. The expression \"world\" meant fo r Gurdjieff something like \"sphere of being,\" \"plane of matt er,\" or \"intensity of vibration .\" The second fu ndamental cosmic law is the Law of the Octave or the Law of Seven. This gove rns the development of proc esse s-for example, the course of a man's life. It determines that there shall be seven worlds along the octave of the Ray of Creation . Directly from the Absolute comes a degree of matter containing all created worlds leading to a less refined stage comprising \"all suns\" which gives place to the order of things existing in all planetary worlds. The Earth comes next to last on the Ray of Creation : it is a very bad place in the univers e--very heavy matter­ subject to a huge number of mechanical laws . This is why a correspondingly intense effort has to be made by man to overcome his mechanica lness. Everything which happens to a man in his ordinary life as part of this machine is produced by the law of accid ent. Only by submitting to influences which come as it were from \"outside\" the mechanism and are transmitted through esoteric chan nels, can man hope to free himself from the \"accide nts\" which are produced by the automatic working of the machine. WAKE UP Organic life on earth, of which man is a part, has a particular cosmic task to perform. To describe this operation of the Law of Seven, Gurdjieff used the metaphor of the musical octave. This requires that there be two"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLUTIONS 143 intervals in the orderly progre ssion of created wor lds: fo r such intervals occur in the musical octave at the stages where the rate of increase of vibrations becomes retard ed. In an asc ending octave these intervals occur between the notes mi and fa and between si and do. On the descending octave of the Ray of Creation , human life helps to fill the second interval . The cosmic fu nction of humanity is to transmit and trans form energies across this interva l. The proud creature man is a thing with a lowly purp ose. There is nothing he can do about it, except to choose between cooperating consciously with the process of transf orming energi es, thereby acquiring something fo r hims elf, and perf orming his unavoidable function in a way which will satisfy the cosmic machine but profit him nothing. The status of org anisms in the universe can be determined by the classification of the substance on which they fe ed. Man fe eds on three sorts of fo od: the ordinary fo od that he eats, the air he breat hes, and his impressions. From these fo ods he manuf actures other subs tance s, which in tum can serve as fo od fo r org anisms which exist on diff erent orders of substance . By work on himself he has the possibility of manuf acturing substances of a higher classificat ion, of transf orming coarse matter into fine. This process is what the alc hemists cal led tran smut ation; it was the \"chemistry\" of which Ouspensky had heard . If fr om the outside it could be said that work on oneself gives the possibility of attain ing higher con­ sciou sness, of becoming man number fo ur, it is Gurd jieff's cosmology that explains this inner alchemy and provides the reason why. By work on himself man can not only perform his cosmic fu nction but manuf acture the substances necessary fo r immortality. Man has no soul-he must get up and make one. Otherwise he goes to fe ed the moon. The moon is the last and most mechanical world on Gurd jieff' s Ray of Creation . It is a degree of matter in which vibrations have almost cea sed. It corr esponds to inert mineral life on earth . It is \"matter without the Holy Ghost .\" This is the destiny of automatic man. i' The process of transmut ation , of manuf acturing the substances necessary to give man immo rtality within the limits of his capacity as an orga nism, is connected with the acquisition of \"higher bodies .\" There are fo ur bodies . possible fo r the \"three-brained being. \" Three are the carnal or physical body, the natural body of emotions and desires, and the spiritual body of mental functionings . Work on oneself is necessary to produce even the . natural and the spiritual bodies. The natural body grows out of the physical body and the spiritual body out of the natural body. If a man has acco mplished the transf ormati09s of substances necessary to acquire a spiritual body, he can proceed to the acquisition of a fo urth body, the divine"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"144 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE body of consci ousness, will, and a real \"I. \" Ourd jieff fo llowed the Upanishads and Plato in comparing the fo ur bodies to a carriage (the physical body), the horse (feelings and desires), the driver (the mind), and the master of horse, carriage and driver (the real \"I\"). The fo urth body is composed of substances much finer than the others and is thus subject to fe wer mechanical laws . Man begins to acq uire higher bodies by tra nsmut­ ing the finest substance man ufac tured automatically by his orga nism. This is \"the substance with which sex wor ks.\" Much later Gurd jieff made it clear that this is sperm itself , rather than some imperceptible corollary. Abuse of sex makes it impossible to begin tra nsmutati on. Something has gone wrong with the fu nction ing of the human organ ism and has prevented man's orderly evolution to higher stat es. The \"line of knowledge\" has outstripped the \"line of bein g.\" What man actually is has been left behind by what he thinks he knows . In fa ct, he even knows very little , because \"objective knowledge\" is possible only fo r a man of higher conscio usness. This division between the line of knowledge and the line of being corre sponds to the division in the psyche between false personality and essence. False personality is what a man thinks he is, and his essence is what he is in fac t. Personality is an illusion, maintained by sleep and what Gurd jieff called \"buff ers,\" which are mech anisms acquired in order to soften the impact of rare glimpses of the truth . Undernea th are all the conflicting \"I's\" of man and an esse nce-the core and basis of what he is­ which may have stopped growi ng in infancy. Whereas personality is subject to the law of acci dent, a man's essence is always of a particular and definable type, subject to the law of fa te, which can at least be allowed fo r and predict ed. A beginning can be made toward liberating oneself fr om fa lse personality by struggling not to \"identify\" too closely with momentary preoccupa tions; a man must learn to \"play a role .\" Eventually, he may discover his \"Chief Featur e\": the most important of the automat isms, which hold him in bondage . This complex and closely connected body of ideas was summed up in a symbol Gurdjieff called the ennea gram . This is based on a circle whose circumf erence is divided by nine points, connected by lines to give a six­ sided figure and a triangle . The ennea gram contains and symbolizes the whole universe and Gurd jieff's explanation of it, including the ' Laws of Three and Seven and the relationship of all substances to one anoth er. In this symbol Gurd jieff altered his musical analogy by an arbitrary redisposi­ tion of the intervals in the octa ve. If the ennea gram is taken as a diagram of possible human evoluti on, it shows how something is needed to help a man across these interva ls. This can be provided only by \"shocks\" administered by a Man Who Knows."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLUT ,I ONS 145 • • Gurd jieff's ideas made an extra ordinary impact on his pupils. Those who were interested in occu ltism were conf ronted by an apparently occult system which seemed to contradict almost every known body of occult ideas . Gurdjieff did relate his teach ing to known mystical philosophie s, but always in a way which emphasized the diff erences between what he taught and the object of comparis on. For example, the term \"Kundalini\" is fo und in much Theosophical literature as the name fo r a fo rce latent in man which must be awakened. Gurd jieff used the expr ession to stand fo r the imaginatio n, the power of fa ntasy which keeps man asleep and prevents him fr om participating in the real world. Late r, in Beelzebub's Tales, he connected this with his doctrine of \"buff ers\" and invented a word , \"Kundabuff er, \" to signify the same hypnotic influence. So much fo r the romantic dreams of believers in occult tradition . As fo r the source of his ideas , he would ref er vaguely to the researches of the Seekers fo r Truth. His teach ing was \"completely self -supporting . . . and it has been com­ pletely unknown up to the present time .\" Once Gurdjieff said that it could be called \"esoteric Christianit y,\" but chiefly he pref erred the phrase , \"The Fourth Wa y,\" or \"The Way of the Sly Ma n.\" The Sly Man, the cunning man-and has not one of his fo llowers compared Gurdjieff to Odysseus?­ used every possible trick to keep himself awake. The man of the Fourth Way avoided the pitf alls of imbalanced development which gaped fo r the fo llowers of the other three \"ways\"-the intellectual way of the yogi, the emotional way of the monk, the physical way of the fakir. He was harmoniously developed with all his centers in phas e. If, on the other hand, a pupil was a refugee fr om positivistic science , Gurd jieff's ideas set the virtues of materialism aga inst the materialists them selves. One example is the process of the transf ormation of energ ies' which Gurdjieff expressed in terms of fo rces he named after the chemical elements. \"Carbon ,\" \"oxyg en,\" and \"nitrogen\" stood fo r the act ive, passive , and neutralizing fo rces which combined to produce the \"hydrog en,\" the phenomenon or grade of matter in the universe. Each of the \"elements\"­ including the \"hydrog en\" -had a numerical cipher attached to indicate its position in the scale of the density of matter. In theory, theref ore, the designation \"hydrogen 24\" enabled the student to place a fo rm of matter or energ y-f or Gurdjieff made no distinction betw een them-in its cos mic relati onship with all other substance s; and Ouspensky worked out compli­ cated mathematical tables to elaborate the hints he was given of this already complex cosmology. Ouspensky's record naturally emphasized the topics which most inter­ ested him, and among. these Were several of his old hobby horses. One was"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"146 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE eternal recurrence, and he at last succeeded-after sotne six months-in extracting from his teach er a qualified endorsement of the idea (later Gurdjieff himself used the concept in an unpublished lecture , \"On Symbols\"). Ouspensky's questions about art provided Gurd jieff's teaching on \"ob jective\" art. A question about the relation of men to the sources of esoteric knowledge gave Ouspensky the chance to expand Gurd jieff's quite straightf orward answer into a beautiful diagram with men numbered like geometrical points. And, when Gurdjieff elaborated his doctrine of the diff erent worlds on the Ray of Creation into a vision of cosmoses arranged in an asce nding hierarchy of dimensions, he actually asked his pupil to expand the material from his own point of view. This greatly excited Ouspensky, who at once saw corr espondences between Gurd jieff's teach ing and the more advanced speculations on multidimensionality which he had been pursuing since Tertium Organum . We can identify the precise time when Ouspensky passed from fa scina­ tion with Gurd jieff's ideas to a deeper commitment to the practical activity prop osed. About a quarter of the way through In Search of the Miraculous he records a conversation about personal ob jective s. What, asked Gu rdjieff , did each member of the group really want? Ouspensky's aim had, of course, to do with his fo urth dimension, Time. He was convinced that it was possible to know the future and claimed success in practical predicti on. This obsession with the fu ture course of events led to resentment at the indignity of a life which might at any second be abruptly ended. It was futile to begin a pro ject without any certainty that it could be complet ed. Ouspensky told Gurdjieff that at all costs he wanted \"to know the fu ture .\" Gurdjieff 's response shows how his angling worke d. He replied that the future would be exactly the same as the past-fo r what was the use of knowing the future if a man could not call himself his own master? Bef ore tryi ng anything so ambitious as knowledge of the future, a man must pay attention to his own machi ne. The beginning of the road was self-observat ion. Gurdjieff asked his pupils what was the most important thing they noticed when they tried to observe themselves. He appeared dissatisfied with the answers given by the group, and he declared that the most important result of self -observation was the realization that one cannot remember oneself.

What is this state of self -re membering which is so difficult to attain and hold? Ouspensky thought of it as a double-headed arrow indicating that atte ntion was directed both at an object and on onese lf-but man has no \" I\"! One of the achi evements of In Search of the Miraculous is that it manages to lay stress on this central aspect of Gurd jieff's teach ing without being specific about the non-existent \"self\" which we are supposed to \"rememb er. \" The double-headed arrow, yes; but what is this curious and vivid state it induces fo r that- \"instant in and out of time?\" \"I have striven at it fo r over a quarter of a centur y, \" writes Henri Tra col, \"and 1 admit, 1 fe el myself as unable to define it in a way which fu lly satisfies me as on the first day. \" However, Maurice Nicoll has provided a preliminary descripti on: . . . . all real Self -Remembering is simply fo rgetting yourse lf, your ordinary self, your ordinary negative \"I' s,\" your ordinary fo rms of internal considering, and all the rest of it, and fe eling certain that some further state of yourself exists above all this personal uproar that takes place all day long in each one of you, with which you keep on identifYing, and when the Work says that we have Real \"I\" above us you must understand that this act, so to speak, of separating from False Personality, deliberately at some moment every day, is designed to make it possible fo r us to come. in contact with the first traces of Real \"I\" which is already there and which is our real goal.

Ouspensky began to see the practice of self-re membering as the central point of Gurd jieff's teaching, and tried unsucces sfully to transf er some of his enthusiasm to his literary fr iends. His experiments had proved to his own sati sfaction that although mankind did indeed exist as a society of sleepwal kers, there was a way out . He may not have realized it at the time, but his attitude had altered considerably since he first met Gur djieff. \"I did not even wish fo r any changes in myse lf, \" he writes about his setting out fo r India. But now his efforts were concentrated on \"waking up. \" The watchword of Gurd jieff's pupils had become \"work on onese lf, \" and soon their efforts were referred to simply as \"the Wor k.\" Only one thing seems definite about this elusive activity. It involves change . Ouspensky· was still in search of the miracul ous, but the miraculous had altered its complexion . It had come to be associated with \"waking up\"; and as 1916 wore on, he and his companions fo und that Gurdjieff applied more and more pressure on them as he extended their activities. He now spent most of his time in St. Petersburg and began to arrange expeditions into the country. Ouspensky came to realize that during these adventures and picnics , Gurd jieff was observing his pupils in roles which they did not adopt during a fo rmal meeting. By now Ouspensky's relationship with Gurd jieff's Mosc ow group had become much closer. At first he had seen them as hopelessly artificial or \"playing a part which had been learned bef orehan d.\" Now he thought that he knew why this had seemed to be so, and why they had originally ref used to answer his questions about the nature of the Work. \"I understand now,\" he wrote, \"that these questions could not be answer ed .\" \"One must learn in order to begin to understand this .\" And with this annoying piece of mystificat ion, all the keys are in our hands. Ouspensky began a series of experiments in fa sting and the exercise of repetitive prayer known to the Orthodox Church as \"prayer of the min d,\" which had helped him in his attempts at self-remembering. He was keyed to a very high emotional pitch when, in August 1916, he arrived to stay at a Finnish dacha- probably the one belonging to Madame Maximovitch . The events of the fe w days he spent in Finland were in many ways the ·strange st of his time with Gurdjieff. Ouspensky was reminded of his first meeting with his Ma ster, when he had asked Gurd jieff 4lbout 'facts .\" He had in mind fa cts of a \"miraculous\" nature , the sort of miracles which he had gone to India to find. Gurd jieff had promised that there wo uld be fa cts. But now Ouspensky's ideas were diff erent, and the word \"facts ,\" with its Significant stressing, related like the miraculous to self -remembering and waking up."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLUT IONS 149 Ouspensky describes what happe ned with many pro�ests that his experiences are incommun icable-th e sort of riders which had always annoyed him in reading the mysti cs. He emphasizes that he arrived in Finland in an excitable condit ion, which was aggravated by Gurd jieff's shock tactics . Gurdjieff was particularly harsh to the group and put Ouspensky severely out of countenance by repeati ng some unfavorable gossip Ouspensky had told him in confidence about Dr. Stoerneval . Then at about ten o'clock in the evening, Gurd jieff took Ouspensky apart with Stoerneval and the mathematician A. A. Zaharoff , and began to demon­ strate certain movements of a type which became important later in his teac hing. Ouspensky says that Gurd jieff neither hypnotized him \"by any of the known methods\" nor did he give him a drug. But he began to hear his teacher's thoughts . At first this took the fo rm of Ouspensky detecting \"thoughts\" directed specifically at him from among the general instructions Gurd jieff was giving to all three men. Then Gurd jieff's voice started asking questions fr om a position somewhere inside Ouspensky's chest; and to the astoni shment of the other pupi ls, he began responding vocally to an interrogation which they could not hear . Gurd jieff's questions caused Ouspensky a great deal of agita tion . He does not say what they were, but merely that they concerned \"certain conditions which I had either to a ccept or leave the work .\" After half an hour's conversati on, Ouspensky reacted to a particular barb from Gurd jieffby rushing outside into the fo rest. For some time he walked about \"wholly in the power of the most extraordinary thoughts and fe elings .\" From this tumult he emerged with the conviction that all Gurd jieff's criti cisms of him were correct . At this point he makes his first important .state ment on the results he obta ined from his \"mir acle .\" \"But I had fo und som ething else. I knew that he would not believe me and that he would laugh at me if I showed him this other thing. But fo r myself it was indubita ble, and what hap pened later showed I was righ t. \" The miracle contin ued. In bed that night Ouspensky resumed mental contact with his teac her. Gurd jieff broke off communi cation when some­ thing he asked Ouspensky set the pupil trembling with fe ar. The next morning the apparently telepathic conversation conti nued. For the three days more that the group stayed in Finland, Ouspensky fe lt himself \"in an unusual emotional state all the time, which sometimes began to be burdensom e.\" In exasperation he asked Gurd jieff how this condition could be made to disappear. Gurd jieff replied that now he had what he wan ted; he was no longer asleep. Ouspensky did not think that this was quite accurate . \"I undoubtedly 'slept' at some moment s.\" The miracle did not come to an end with the stay in Finla nd. After Gurdjieff left st. Petersburg fo r Mosc ow, Ouspensky \"conversed\" tele-"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"150 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE pathically with him while receiving a visual image of Gurdjieff in the train. And, for the next three weeks as he walked around St : Petersburg, he was continually conscious that everyone around him was asleep. Ouspensky's \"miracle\" can be explained in a number of ways. The most important fact is that, as a result of the episode, he observed a change taking place in himsel f. Because he felt that the personal nature of his conversations with Gurdjieff precluded publicati on, it is impossible to be specific. But he came to conclusions which in the light of later events appear as a statement of princi ple: The first thing I could record was the weaken ing in me of that extreme individualism which up to that time had been the fundament al feature in my attitude to life. I began to see people more, to feel my community with them more. And the second thing was that some­ where very deep down inside me I understood the esoteric principle of the impossibility of violence , that is, the uselessness of violent means to attain no matter what. I saw with undoubted clarity, and never afterwards did I wholly lose this fe eling, that violent means and methods in anything whatever would unf ailingly produce negative results , that is to say, results opposed to those aims for which they were applied. What I arrived at was like Tolstoi's non-resistance in appearance but it was not at all non-resist ance because I had reached it n�cfrom an ethical but from a practical point of view; not from the standpoint of what is better or what is worse but from the standpoint of what is more effective and expedie nt. It was after the intrusion of the miraculous into the Finnish dacha-that is, during the aut umn and winter of 1916-that Gurdjieff began greatly to expand his cosmology. Then he left the St. Petersburg group largely to their own devic es. The progre ss of the war and the social discontents arising from it had begun to penetrate even their charmed circle. By November 1916, external circumstance s--what Ouspensky called \"events\"-could no longer be ignored; one result was that many new recruits arrived in the group. Ouspensky admits that the sense of imminent disaster which engulf ed his friends added to their concern with Gurdjieff's ideas. For the System explained everythi ng. Gurdjieff taught that war was the result of man not prodUcing certain energies--in other words, becoming con­ scious--and that instead , nature was forced to obtain such energies from the expenditure of human life. His pupils began to compare the System to Noah's Ark. The Bible story appeared as a parable signifying the way in which men could be saved from the world of \"events\" by esoteric know ledge . \"We could not imagin e,\" Ouspensky writes, \"how we could live"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE INNE R AND THE OUTER REVO LUTI ONS 151 without it and find out our way in the labyrinth of all existing contradic­ tions .\" In the 1950s one reviewer of In Search of the Miraculous remarked that in no other book about the years 1914-19 was there so little ref erence to the Russian Revolution . Of cour se, Ouspensky and his fr iends took note of political developm ents, but the history of crime was what they were trying to escape . By diminishing personally, they were to become invisi ble, veiled by their detac hment from the outer worl d. They were growing small like Alice in Wonderland, and the Ark in which they drifted on the ocean of \"events \" was a raft on the Sea of Tea rs. One of the new recruits to Gurd jieff's teach ing in the gloomy time just bef ore the Revolution was Thomas Alexandrovich de Hartma nn. De Hartma nn, born in 1886, had already achieved some fa me as a composer. In 1906 his ballet Beauty and the Beast had been perf ormed in St. Petersburg . In 1907 another ballet, The Pink Flowe r, was perf ormed at the Opera, in the presence of the Tsar, with Pavlova, Fokine, and Nijinsky in the cast. From 1908 to 1911, de Hartmann lived in Mu nich where he studied conducti ng. He believed with Beethoven that \"music is a higher revelation than philosophy and science\" and he too emba rked on the search fo r Higher Pow ers. He says nothing about the early years of his quest, except that he \"came in contact with many 'ways' and met many exceptional people , but they never seemed to be what I was looking fo r.\" The direction of his search can only be intimat ed. In Muni ch, he fre quented the Kandinsky circle , which was seriously concerned with Anthroposophy. In Russia, he was a friend of Scriabin , the most Me ssianic of all the Russian com posers, and studied piano under the Theosophist Essipova, who introduced Paul Dukes • The Secret Doctrine . \"'.The de Hartmanns were members of the Russian aristocra cy. Thomas � the great-nephew of Eduard von Hartma nn, the author of The P h ilosophy of the Unconscious; and he was released fr om military service to devote his time to music after a personal meeting with the Tsar. His wif e, Olga Arcadi evna de Schumaker, was the daughter of a senior government offi cial. The couple were living at Tsarskoye Selo when d� Hartmann's search led him to a member of Gurd jieff's St. Petersburg group : A. A. Zaharoff. In the autumn of 1916 Zaharoff told de Hartmann that he had at last fo und a teache r. The composer was skeptical, having already met his fa ir share of quac ks. But Zaharoff intrigued him by refusing to reveal his teacher's name and telling him of the thousand roubles entry fe e to the Work . Although the sum was large, de Hartmann could have paid it, and eve ntually that December he was given an appo intment to meet Gurdjieff. The composer had been recalled to the colors , and the meeting was"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE arran ged at a restaurant on the corner of the Nevsky Prospekt in which no Guard's officer would dare to be seen. When Zaharoff appea red, he led poor de Hartmann to an even more disreputable spot, a second-floor cafe frequented by prostitu tes, where discovery would have meant fo rfeiting his commission. Gurdjieff arrived with Dr. Stoerneval and another man who was possibly Me rkouroff. He presented a seedy appearance, with his filthy detachable shirt cuff s, his Caucasian fe atures , and his off ensive remarks . At one point Gurdjieff looked round the caf e and shocked the composer by observing: \"There are usually more whores her e.\" Like Ouspensky, de Hartmann was impressed by Gu rdj ieff, almost despite himself. And he had never seen such eyes . . . . He stuck to his guns and asked to be admitted to Gurd jieff's Work. But when he offered his thousand rou bles, Gurd jieff refused them, saying that although he had no need of help at the moment, the time would come when de Hartmann would be glad to hand over all his worldy goo ds. The composer had met his Ma ster at the very last minute. Gurdjieff was no longer to be often in St. Petersburg, and the demands of the war were soon to disrupt the little group of discip les. Even Ouspensky had been called up, and spent fo ur months in the Guards Sappers before being discharged because of weak eyesight. In February 1917, Gurd jieff paid his last visit to St. Petersburg, and soon afterward de Hartmann left fo r the fro nt. With him went his wife , who had met Gurd jieff on only one occ asion, but that single encounter and a reading of Glimpses of Truth had decided her to fo llow her husband to Gurdjieff as soon as circumstances allow ed. Gurd jieff left fo r Moscow by train fo r the last time-and to some of his pupils, he seemed to be transfigured in the window of his railway carria ge. In the same carriage a celebrated journalist was traveling. This man assumed that Gurd jieff was of the same type as the war profiteers and Caucasian oil magnates who filled the coach . Gurdjieff encouraged his compan ion in this belief , but disquieted him by the cynical amusement with which he surveyed the hubbub of the money-mak ers. Was Gurd jieff also not anxious fo r his profits , asked the journalist? He smiled in a particularly calm way and answered gra vely: \"We profit from everyt hing. Nothing can stop us. War or no war,. it's all the' same to us. We always pro fit.\" \"What do you deal in, then?\" \"In Solar energ y.\" On March 8 and 9 strikers crossed the Neva into St. Petersburg.

On March 15, the Tsar abdicated in fa vor of the Grand Duke Michael. Next day the Grand Duke also resigned the thr one. Ouspensky read the news of the abdication on a flyer and fe lt that Russian history had ended. About a week later he cal led the leading members of the group to Dr. Stoerneval's house and proposed that they emigrate . There was no sense in staying in a country where they could not work . Since most of his companions disagreed, matters went no fu rther. Soon afterward, a postcard arrived from Gurd jieff which said that he was going to Alex­ andropol in the Cauca sus. He asked Ouspensky to continue the work of the group and promised to return by Easter. The card had been written before the Revolution took place , and it was plain that Gurd jieff knew nothing of events . What were they to do? A week after Easter a telegram came announcing Gurdjieff s arrival in May. On April 16, Lenin arrived at the Finland Station . At last, in early June, Ouspensky had a second telegram fr om Alex­ andro pol. It read : \"If you want to rest, come here to me.\" Ouspensky set off fo r the Caucasus through a country still dazed and unsure of what was happe ning. His train took two days longer than usual to reach Alexandropol because he had to run the gauntlet of drunken deser ters and drumhead courts-martial . He arrived to find Gurdjieff assembling a dynamo fo r his brother. He liked Alexandrop ol. Despite the taint of provincia lism, which had made the more snobbish of Gurd jieff' s Mu scovite fo llowers look doubtfully I.l,tJlim , Caucasia was an area of romance . To Ouspensky particu larly, as a devotee of Lermontov's Hero of Our TiTTle, the Caucasus would have carri ed all the associatio ns of adventure . The main mountain range is about 750 miles long and at its broadest, over 100 miles wide. The highest peak, Mount Elbruz, is over 18, 000 fe et high. There are glacie rs, fo rests, rain, snow, and appalling transport difficultie s. The inhabitants represent an Opposite pole to European tow nspeople. And here, the torments of Lermontov's hero in the countryside with its frivolous wate ring places provided a fine precedent fo r the spiritual battles which developed under Curd jieff's direction . The romantic associations of the Cauca sus may partly explain the special atmosphere of Gur djieff 's work the re, which the participants remembered. After a fo rtnight in Alexandropol both Ouspensky and Gurdjieff set off fo r St. Petersburg, but on the way Gurd jieff changed his plans and Ouspensky went on alone. He had instructions not to stay long, but merely to gather any other pupils who wanted to come from Moscow and the cap ital . Ouspensky had tried to per.suade Gurdjieff to emigrate, but without"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE success. In Alexandropol he had had the impression that his Master was waiting for something, and it might have been that Gurdjieff was still listening to the gra pevine leading through his intelligence contacts . He told Ouspensky that what appeared to be unfavorable circumstances would in the end prove to have worked to their advan tage; and instead of leaving fo r Europe, he took a house on the outskirts of Essentuki, a spa district in the central Caucasus northeast of Mount Elbruz and quite near the main railway line running north and south. For six weeks Gurdjieff worked with his pupils in this small rented house. He explai ned that the Work demanded \"super-e ff orts .\" These meant forcing oneself to make exertions beyond what was strictly necessary; for exam ple, chopping wood in half the time normally required, or persuading the body to face unpleasant conditions when there was really no need. This super-effort would connect a particular center with an almost unlimited source of energy, which Gurdjieff described as a \"Great Accumulat or.\" The Work was beginning to take on an increas ingly practical aspect; for one thing, the pupils did all the household chores. Gurdjieff showed them exerci ses fo r removing muscular tension and introduced them to another exercise for which he became famous. This was the \"Stop.\" When the teacher called \"stop,\" the pupils had to freeze in the position in which they fo und themselves, no matter how uncomf ortable or danger ous. This provided an opportunity to study one's machine which would otherwise not occur. An engineer, who occas ionally pertormed the function of pupil-teacher and whom Ouspensky simply calls P., was caught with a hot glass of tea in his hand. Zaharoff heard the order just after inhaling a cigarette and endured what he described as the most unpleasant experience of his life. Physical exercises of an entirely new pattern were introduc ed. Ouspensky has described one. A man sits on the ground with knees bent and holding his arms, with the palms ofthe hands close together, between his feet. Then he has to lift one leg and during this time count: om, om, om, om, om, om, om, om up' to the tenth om and nine times om, seven times om and so on down to one then again twice om, three times om, and so on, and at the same time \"sense\" his left ear and his right eye. Then separate the thumb and \"sense\" his left ear and so on, and so on. The order of the movements had to be remembered and coordinated with the counting; and both activities taken by themselves were quite difficult enough. Gurdjieff would complicate the affair with a breath ing exerc ise; not content with this, he introduced a fast during which he"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLUT IONS 155 exercised his pupils mercil essly. And these, he said, wer e only the preparatory exercises. More people arrive d. Thomas de Hartmann managed to procu re a pass to leave St. Petersburg fo r Rostov on Don on the pretext of working at military inventions . He and his wif e went nowhere near Rostov , but headed straight fo r Essentuki. The morning after they left St. Petersburg, soldie rs called at the home of Mme. de Hartmann's parents to arr est her husband . The de Hartmanns arrived in Es sentuki on August 28 and were pitchf orked into the extraordinary conditions under which the colony exist ed. They were so far from appreciating the sort of lif e they were to experience at the hands of those twin agents of havoc, Gurdjieff and the Revoluti on, that they brought their cham bermaid . Olga de Hartma nn's first glimpse of the assembled disciples reminded her of a scene fr om Gorky's Underworld . She and her husband were introduced to the \"St op\" exerci se, and also to Gurd jieff's tal ent fo r driving his foll ow ers to desperation . No sooner had the couple arrived than Gurd jieff began talking of giving up all work and going to Persia. To earn the money to do this, he proposed to break stones on the roa ds. He seemed to fe el that the main obstacle to the de Hartmanns' fo llowing him was that after a day of stone-breaking the women must wash their husba nds' fe et. Now Zahar off's fe et would smell awfu l, and while there were some women who could wash fe et with equani mity, what about Olga de Hartmann who could not do without a chambermaid ... ? Gurd jieff's talk of aban doning work discouraged some of the pupils who were still not fu lly committed . Ouspensky himself was becomin g confused by bis teac her's erratic changes of mood. Gurdj ieff announced hi s departure for Persia, but in fa ct left with Zaharoff and Mme. Ostrowsky to stay at Tuapse on the Black Sea co ast. Ouspensky fo llowed them ther e and then decided to pay a visit to St. Petersburg before the winter. The de Hartmanns stayed with Gurdjieff. One Sunday afternoon they set out with Zaharoff , Gurdjieff, and his wif e to walk in the direction of Sochi, further down the coas t, taking their luggage in a cart. Gurd jieff decided on a short cut over the mountai ns. The expedition walked until 2 A. M., and Thomas de Hartmann was deprived of sleep because he was selected fo r guard duty. Next day he was awar ded the privilege of riding in the cart; and he soon discovered why. If he had been walking, it would have been comparatively easy to stay awake , but on top of the pile of luggage, there was the constant temptation to fa ll aslee]>-which meant the certainty of tumbling to the gr ound. At the end of the second day they were allowed two days' rest, but soon the caravan was on its way aga in. Olga de ;Hartr.nann had started out-in a pair of fa shionable shoes and finished the trip With bare and bleeding fe et. T he five members of the exped ition halted"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE fifteen miles from Sochi at a village called Uch Dar ye, where Gurdjieffhad rented a house. Almost at once de Hartmann collap sed with typhoid, and during his delirium, a letter arrived informing him of the confiscation of his estates. Ever afterward Thomas de Hartmann was to attribute his recovery to Gurdjieff. It was Gurdjieff who soothed him and prescribed placebos; it was Gurdjieff who removed him to a hospital . When he first b ecam e deliriou s, Gurdjieff had been left alone with him and was discovered by Olga de Hartmann with \"his face as white as his suit.\" \"I have no more fear for his head,\" were his first words, and the implication is that the Master had done something -Tibetan medicine? Hypnotism? Magic? -which had slackened the grip of the illnes s. At Uch Darye, the crisis among Gurdjieff's pupils was greater than that caused by the sickness of a single man. Ouspensky arrived to find even the devoted Zaharoff discouraged. The mathematician had seen him off to St. Petersburg with exhortations not to become trapped in the capital. He himself had burned his boats , he said. But now something had happened ­ Ouspensky suggests that whatever happened, happened as the result of a quarrel between Gurdjieff and his neighbors which Zaharoff had over­ heard-and Gurdjieff was behaving in a manner which practically fo rced Zaharoff to leave . Ouspensky considered that this would be pure idiocy on his part, \"I would not have sent a dog to St. Petersburg at that time.\" But Zaharoff left. Dr. Stoerneval and his wife had arrived, after receiving a telegram : \"Realise everything you can and come at once.\" Mme. Stoerneval was reluctant to leave her family and the relative comforts of St. Petersburg, even at that late juncture, but eventually her husband's arguments prevai led. Dr. Stoerneval managed to withdraw his bank deposits, and the couple left St. Petersburg two weeks before the Revolution broke out. Early on the morning of October 25, Bolshevik forces went into action in St. Petersburg; and in the evening, the transfer of power to the Soviets was procla imed. It was an event which could not fail to have repercu ssions even on a small band of seekers for truth on the shores of the Black Sea. In the Caucasus the political situation was becoming very confused. In addition to the Soviet-inspired \"Tran s-Caucasian Commissaria t,\" the White fo rces had to contend with Caucasian separatists-Georgian s, Armenians, and Azer­ baijanis-who were not content with establ ishing claims to their resur­ rected nations, but vied incessantly with one anothe r. In the south, the Turks , who were still at war with Russia, occupied Batum. The issue was further complicated by troops of the Allied Powers which were attempting to help the anti-Bolshevik elements and at the same time, prevent the Turks from advancing further into Russia."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE INNER AND THE OUTER REVOLU TIONS 157 At first Gurd jieff moved his household from Uch Darye to another village near Tuapse, lest the colony should be cut off from supplies. Then in December, a rumor was heard that a Caucasian army was moving up the shores of the Black Sea. Gurdjieff decided to return to Essentuki and begin work again. On February 12, a circular letter was sent out over Ouspensky's name to the Moscow and 5t. Petersburg groups, and in March about fo rty people collected in Essentuki, including once more Zaharoff. The life of the colony at Essentuki was a fo retaste of what Gurdjieff created on a larger scale at Fonta inebleau. His fo llowers rose early. They were allowed a pound of bread a day and had tea in the morning and the evening. At lunch they ate soup, meat, and vegetables out of communal dishes. Gurdjieff never ceased to make difficultie s. He changed the arrangement of the rooms in the house, moved the furniture around, and discountenanced members of the Moscow group who were new to this phase of his work. For some time he had been carrying with him a quantity of silk thread; he now decided that this must be sold to obtain funds. De Hartmann was asked to provide sheets of the special paper he kept fo r his compositions-it had become so rare that Prokofieff had traveled from Kislovodsk for the gift of a quire--which were promptly torn up to make spoo ls on which the silk was wound. The composer was then sent to Kislovodsk to sell the silk. He had many acqua intances in the town, and in acute embarras sment crept off to discharge his obligation under cover of darkness. His attempts were successful-until, on entering yet another shop, he encountered Gurdjieff who called a halt to de Hartmann's salutary lesson in extent of his class pride. G�djieff elaborated the difficult movements he had begun to teach . At one stage the members of the group were taught an alphabetic code expressed through the positions of the body. Then they were fo rbidden to communicate in any other way. Once Gurdjieff ordained a fast, and moved men and women on to separate floors of the house. There came a time when � e women were asked to give Gurdjieff all their jewelry. Olga de H.artmann cried all night, and, completely drained of any affection fo r her family jewels, delivered them to her Master. Gurdjieff scarcely acknowl­ edged the gift-b ut as she was leaving, he called her back and returned her property . On the other hand, someone to whom Mme. de Hartmann later told her story blithely surrendered a valuable item to Gurdjieff and never �ived it back. With such devices Gurdjieff played on his pupils' lives like !D. artist on an instrument. In the evenings, he talked to them in his own � t-hung room and occasionally prescribed individual exerci ses. In the � omings, he sat to watch how his pupils took the announce ments of the OO:en unpleasant activities tor the day which he posted on the notice board. The difficulty in trying to describe what was going on at Essentuki is"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"158 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE almost insurm ountable at this stage. Not only is the Man Who Knows impossible to know hims elf, but the Work itself is invisible. The story of Olga de Hartmann and her jewels seems a trite morality, and in certain respects it was . But it undoubtedly had its place in the context of the total situation at Esse ntuki and in the context of Mme. de Hartma nn's private situation. What the experience meant, what meaning there was in it fo r her, is the only thing which matters-and there is no way of fo llowing up a series of such developments because the necessary fran kness would rarely be fo rthco ming. All the historical observer can do is to concentrate on various points in the Work in a way which may gradua lly build up a picture of what the process may be. There is a similar difficulty in discu ssing Gurd jieff's \"movements\" and \"sacred danc es. \" We can gather fr om Ouspensky that the immensely difficult movements which required the coordination of separate and wildly complicated tasks fo r head, heart and ha nds, must have been connected with the idea of developing the activ ities of inte llect , emotion s, and the physical body into one harmonious union . No doubt the pupil would acquire more conscious control of his orga nism. But was this the sole or even the chief purpose of the exer cises? Almost certainly not. Some of Gurd jieff's moveme nts-like the music which he later dictated to Thomas de Hartmann -were given not as if compl eted fo r a particular purpose, but almost as probl ems to be worked out. The principles would be outlined and the skeleton had to be clot hed. What then was the ob ject; what were they all doing in the middle of a civil war pretending to be characters fr om Gorky or Lermontov or Dostoievsky? The spell of Gurdjieff does not explain the intensity of the experiences through which some of his pupils passed, and until the experiences of other fo llowers provide data fo r comparison, there is no way of conveying the nature of what was actually in progr ess. Beneath the pupils' acc ounts runs another level of events at which they may not even hint. This is probably not because their experiences are in any real sense inc ommuni cabl e, but because a fu ll conf ession might well be too painful-and would have no chance of conveying the depth of personal meaning which a particular event conta ined. Even those acti vities which were recorded during the time at Essentuki soon became overw helmed by the demands of survival . In Mee t ings with Remarkable Men, Gurd jieff describes what must have been one of the most tragic events in his whole lif e. This was the un,rxpected arrival of nearly thirty of his relations who had fled fr om Alexandropol to avoid being massacred by the advancing Turks . His fat her did not escape and was killed by the invading army. Gurdjieff was already supporting a colony of destitute aristocrats and intellectua ls, and the appearance of his emaciated fa mily increased still further his material responsibilitie s."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE INNE R AND THE OUTER REVOLUT IONS 159 • During the summer of 1918 the political situation in the spa area around Essentuki gradually deteriorat ed. Life grew increasingly difficult for the bands of refugees from central Russia. There was no news from the capital and conditions of simple hardship gave way to those of civil war. Internal conditions were changing also, perhaps as a result of the two months' period of intensive work under Gurdjieff. New perspectives may have been opening up as the results of self-observation and discipline created new meanin gs-and destroyed old ones. The destruction of old meanings may have had many different results. It all depended on the person, his aims and attitude toward the process by which he had been forced to discard the meanings which animated him bef ore. Our sole witness for the changes of the summer of 1918 is Ouspensky but, as he himself was a leading figure and the events of which we are certain took place almost entirely inside him, he is the best possible witness we could have. And it should be noted that Ouspensky thought that most of the group which had worked with Gurdjieff for any length of time were experiencing similar proce sses. Ouspensky's account of his break with Gurdjieff is extraordinarily import ant. It was not his only statement on his reasons for parting with his teacher-and the parting was not yet final. His later pronounce ments and their significance must wait until the glyph has unfolded a little further and there is more material for assessing the possibilities; but it may begin to appear that In Search of the Miraculous is a remarkably subtle book, and that beneath the surface discussions of Gurdjieff's doctri ne is concealed ano ther layer of information which may more truly be said to form its spbject matte r. \"For a whole year,\" Ouspensky wrote, \"something had been accumulat­ ing, and I gradually began to see that there were many things I could not understand and that I had to go .\" ... I had for some time begun to separate G. and the ideas . I had no doubts about the ideas . On the contrary, the more I thought of them, the deeper I entered into them, the more I began to value them and realise their significan ce. But I began very strongly to doubt that it was possible for me, or even for the majority of our company, to continue to work under G.' s leadership . I do not in the least mean that I found any of G.'s actions or methods wrong or that they failed to respond to what I expec ted. . . . All work consists in doing what the leader indica tes, understanding in,conformance with his opinions even those things that he does not say plainly, helping him in everything that he does. There can be no other attitude towards the work. And G. himself"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"160 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE said several times that a most important thing in ·the work was to reme mber that one came to learn and to take no other role upon oneself. At the same time this does not at all mean that a man has no choice or that he is obliged to follow something which does not respond to what he is seeking. Gurdjieff himself had admitted that all teachers worked through their different specialities; but what, Ouspensky wondered, if these activities were quite alien to a pupil? He compared his situation to that in which he would have found himself had he discovered that Gurdjieff had all the time been leading him toward a religious attitude-the way of the monk. Then, he would have felt fully justified in leaving the Work. This would not have been because of any prejudice against the ethics of the monastery, which might well be superior to his own; but they were not his ethics, and the way of the monk was not his way. \"I had nothing to say against G.'s methods ,\" he writes, \"except that they did not suit me.\" What was the cause of this disillusionment? Ouspensky says nothing further in In Search of the Miraculous-which was completed twenty years before his death. He states bluntly that Gurdjieff was leading him in a different direction from the one he had at first seemed to indicate . But whatever he thought about Gurdjieff's intentions, he does not say; he disguises his suspicions with the metaphor of the monastery walls closing about him. Whether this is the whole truth is another matter, and the inquirer may well decide that further investigation makes this doubtful; for In Search of the Miraculous is a book whose clarity is deceptive. What is clear is that Ouspensky decided after a great struggle to leave Gurdjieff and begin work independently. He left the communit y and went to live by himself. Although he maintained friendly relation s with Gurdjieff, he returned to work on the material which he had begun to arrange in 1911 and which was later published under the title of A New Model of the Universe . The working title of this book was \"The Wisdom of the Gods\"-a translation of the term \"theosop hy\"-and Ouspensky's reversion to his former concerns is typical of the effect of Gurdjieff' s teaching on many of his pupils. Ouspensky was stilI in search of the miraculous, and still believed that through it lay his way. . As the political situation grew even more dangerou s, it became clear that the only prudent course was to leave Essentuki. The town had a Bolshevik government, and Gurdjieffhad camouflaged his activities under the Soviet­ sounding title of an \"International Idealistic Society .\" Cossacks of the White fo rces began to raid the railway and eventually to attack the town itself. Refugees started to make for Novorossisk across the mountains on the Black"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE INNE R AND THE OUTER REVOLUT IONS 161 Sea coast. But Ouspensky hung on, although he had already decided to head for London where he had originally planned to publish his \"Wisdom of the Gods.\" He waited until Gurd jieff himself left Essentuki. \"In this respec t,\" he wrote, \"I had a strange kind of fe eling. I wanted to wait until the end; to do everything that depended upon me so that afterwards I could tell myself that I had not let a single possibility escape me. It was very difficult for me to reject the idea of working with G.\" Events made the break for him. Gurdjieff himself was worried by the threate ning conditions which surrounded his group, and particularly by the danger for his pupils of military age. The Bolsheviks , the White Army, and partisans of every description were conscripting all the able bodied men they could find, and if the war were moving nearer to Essentuki, they must then be moved out of the combat zone as soon as possible. According to Gurdjieff 's account in Meetings with Remarkable Men, he then decided to make the escape of his party the occasion for an expedition . He wanted to find certain prehistoric dolmens in which he was interested, and applied to the Essentuki Soviet for permission to mount an archaeological expedi­ tion in the mounta ins. The expedition was to have a secondary aim in searching for gold. Ouspensky told Gurdjieff that, for washing the gold, alcohol would be necessary in large quantiti es. The higher Soviet in Pyatigorsk was so impressed by Gurdjieff's application that they not only provided equipment for the expedition in the shape of tents and tools, but the alcohol as well. Gurdjieff's efficiency and his choice of cover for his escape argue great familiarity with the ways and means of organizing \"scientific\" expeditions . By infiltrating the Soviet passport office , Gurdjieff secured passes for the �lony . He gave lessons in finding one's way by the stars and in movement by night . It was apparent that the trial at hand was not merely one of physical endurance and good fortune . The journey would be both internal and external , a mountaineering expedition which was allegorical, yet in d�sperate earnest. For the de Hartmann s, who had the opportunity to e l!1 igrate in comfort under the protection of powerful friends, the coming privations presented real difficu lties, especially as Olga de Hartmann was exhausted by the earlier austeriti es. The rules which Gurdjieff laid down were ferocious. Absolute obedience was demande d. Infring ements of the code would be punishable by death . And Gurdjieff placed a large revolver on the table. The de Hartmanns already knew something of his methods . But they had been with their teacher for a very short time compared to some of the other �pupils whom Ouspensky watched leave with forebodings . He clearly <� e xpected that those who had worked with Gurdjieff for the same length of time as he himself had would discover identical problems; and to a large exte nt, he was right. But his hesitations cost him dearly. Gurdjieff's party"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE left at the beginning of August 1918. Ouspensky decided to go to Novor ossisk. A week after GurdjieH\" s departure, raiding Cossacks cut the railway line. The civil war enclosed Essentuki, and Ouspensky was trapped with the ten or so pupils of Gurdjieff who had remained behind . \"1 must conf ess 1 fe lt very silly ,\" he writes ruefully . \"1 had not gone abroad when it was possible in order to work with G. and the final outcome was that 1 had parted from G. and stopped with the bolsheviks .\" History had overtaken him . Like his characte r, \"Leslie White ,\" he was trapped in the battle fo r survival . '''Ev ents' gave little time ,\" he wrote, \"for philosophical speculati ons.\" While Gurdjieff was riding the wave, Ouspensky seemed to be temporarily engulf ed. This may have been a blessing in disguise , or it may have been the curse it appeare d to be. It depends on what interpretation is given to his break with Gu rdjieff. The parting from a Man Who Knows , even if the pupil's ideas are changed out of all recognition by his period of learning, may be a painful process. Ouspensky had concluded that Gurd jieff was not the Master fo r whom he had hoped. He had partially withdrawn the meaning he had projected into the relat ionship, but it was the physical separation which began to make his choice fo r him. The outer revolution gave the axis of his inner life another half-tum."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"7 The Traveling Circus Gurd jieff and his expedition started in two groups from Essentuki and the nearby town of Pyatig orsk. They traveled in two railway cars which he had somehow inveigled from the Soviet authorit ies. After two days, they reached the town of Maikop, at the edge of the mountains on a branch line southwe st of the main railway from the Caucasus to Tsaritsyn (Volgagrad) and central Russia. The town was the center of a pitched battle between Red and White forces, and all their official papers from the Bolsheviks were useless. Gurdjieff had originally intended to continue by rail from Maikop to the coastal region near Tuapse , and meant to begin his expedition proper with a line of march roughly parallel to the sea in a southerly direction. But \"events\" made such a plan unfeasible, and for a time, the company halted in an abandoned farm near Maikop . They tumbled into an unexpected idyll, for the farm even included a Swim ming place in the White River, and they were able to relax sufficiently to ignore the bullets whistling overhe ad. However, Gurdjieff devised means-even in Arcadia -of creating fric­ tion among his followers . The expedition was divided into small parties, each of which had a member responsible for buying and preparing food for the others. Then Thomas de Hartmann was ordered to leave his group of four and to eat with Gurdjieff's own circle. Olga de Hartmann was left to cook· first for two other' toen, and then for just one, whom she did not 163"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE particularly like. Finally she was left to eat alone. Th,e day was filled with farm work , which provided many opportunities for Gurd jieff's ingenious brand of needling. De Hartmann writes of the appoint ment of a lady to supervise the grooming of the horses, whose duties did not extend to helping with the work. \"And so, when we were scrubbing away with all our might, this lady would appear and say: 'Here you have not scrubbed enoug h,' or 'a little more there.' This was calculated to irritate us but we would not show our annoyance . Besides, life at the moment was so wonder ful that it was impossi ble to be angry .\" The battle fo r Maikop ended with a temporary victory fo r the White forces, and Gurdjieff's party left their oasis fo r the hills. The day af ter their departure Maikop was recaptured by the Bolsheviks. They had escaped through the last possible gap in the net which had trapped Ouspensky. For a few days their route lay through populated farmlands before striking up into the mountains on a southwesterly course which would take them through sparsely settled highlands and down to the town of Sochi on the Black Sea. The journey became adventur ous. Every so often they had to show their papers-wh ether these were White Russians or Bolshevik depended on which side of his moustache Gurdjieff twirled. In \"The Material Questi on,\" Gurdjieff reproduce s a certificate which entitled him to carry a revolver. On one side it was signed by the officials of the Essentuki Soviet, and on the other by a White general in Maikop. Gurdjieffhimself marveled at the ease with which he managed to extricate his party from the various difficult situations into which they stumbled: \"It was not due entirely to my well­ developed ability to discern and play upon the slightest changes in the weakn esses of the psyche of people in a psych osis of this kind.\" But to followers like the de Hartman ns, who hung upon the Master's every word, their good fortune seemed nothing short of \"inspired guidance .\" Although the direct influence of the war was left beneath them, the party encountered danger from the flotsam and jetsam cast up by the conflict i.n the hills. They met a monk, fleeing from the Bolsheviks, whose community had established itself in a cave with as much of its church fu rniture as could be salvaged . Once, a group which included the de Hartmanns was ambushed by bandits with whom Mme. de Hart�nn coped resou �cefully, even inducing them to sign a piece of paper stating that they had taken all useful possessions. The climb through the mountains with their baggage carried on their backs taught a degree of practica lity, even to a collection of city intellectua ls. Toward the end of the grueling journey they did find a dolmen. Gurdjieff announced that dolmens might once have been road signs to places of initiati on, and asked a party of hunters encountered by the expedition whether they knew of other monuments il! the area. The answer"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 165 was negati ve; so Gurd jieff embarked on an exper iment. He made some calculatio ns, and set off through the woods in a precise directi on. Sure enough, another dolmen was fo und, and a third where Gurd jieff indicat ed. At length the scientific expedition emerged on the Black Sea coast at Sochi, we ll outside the battle zone. They had a celebratory dinner in a good hot el; and Thomas de Hartma nn, who had finished the trek with his fe et all but useless through septica emia, had his visions of uninterrupted slumber shattered by a command from Gurdjieff to rise at six o'clock and fe ed the horse s. The storm which had been gat hering now broke . \"In Sochi ,\" writes Ouspensky, \"the greater part of the company, as I had fo reseen, parted company with G.\" Gurd jieff's own version of events is that \"certain members of the expedition , during what might be called our 'Way of Golgotha, ' were not equal to the situat ion, but manif ested properties not corre sponding at all to the high aim we had in view; I decided to part with them ... \" The de Hartmanns say nothing of the cause of this rupt ure. \"Mr. Gurdj ieff suddenly announced that the expedition was finished. He advised us to make plans fo r the future as he had no more money to support any of us.\" The result was that only Gu rdjieff, Mme. Ostrowsky, the de Hartma nns, the Stoerneva ls, and possibly one or two others remained in Sochi . Members of Gurd jieff's fo rmer Moscow group left fo r Kiev or returned to Ess entuki, which had been retaken by the White fo rce s. Among the def ectors were P., the engineer, and Zaharoff. The fo rmer left for Maikop , where he became the director of a state school. Zaharoff went to Kiev, but later moved to Rostov- on-Don. What was the meaning of this dispersal ? Was it that Gurdjieff was simply tired of his pupils? Or had they ceased to understand and the refore could �. be .taught? Perhaps it was a test which the majority of the pupils fa iled by demonstrating that they placed a low valuation on the Work. But perhaps the pupils who left were the ones who understo od? Those who remained were, as Ouspensky said, still \"young in the wor k,\" with the exception of Dr. Stoerneval, and they may still have had a lot to learn . P:ossibly Gurdjieff had separated the sheep from the goats deliberately; possibly his conduct was really insupportable fo r one reason or another, or it may be that the money had indeed run out and circumstances dictated a policy of sauve qui peut . The problem is the same as that of Ouspensky' s breach with Gurdjieff, and must awai t a resoluti on. In the middle of January 1919, Gurd jieff's diminished company em­ barked at Sochi fo r the Georgian port of Poti and so arrived in Tiflis . The autu mn and winter of 1918-19 which Ouspensky passed in Boishevik­ occ upied Essent uki were seasons of great difficulty. \"For me and my famil y,\" he wrote, \"things turned out comparatively fa vourably. Only two"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"166 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE people out of fo ur got ill with typ hoid. No one died. Not once were we robbed.

Sventitsky's two children, a heroic endeavor which earned him the undying gratitude of his adopted daughte r. He became a house porter and then a teacher at a state gymna sium. When he discovered that the Bolsheviks had requisitioned all the books in the town , he cowed the local Commissar, who \"was a simple man and began to be almost frightened of me when 1 told him that 1 had written books of my ow n.\" Ouspensky had himself made librarian and established a library in the school where he had previously taught. His idea was to preserve the books until better days when they could be returned to their owne rs. He fo rtified himself behind a large notice reading ESSENTUKI SOVIET LIBRARY and spent his time reading his collect ion. One night in January 1919, the Cossa cks reca ptured Essentuki fo r the White Army. The librarian was galvanized into activity . \"I ran round to the school in spite of the firing and tore down the word 'So viet' fo r fe ar the Cossa cks came and destroyed everythin g , and so it read simply ' ESS ENTUKI LIBRARY . ' And next day 1 started to hand back the books to their owners .\" Despite this temporary liberat ion, Ouspensky was not able finally to leave Essentuki until June 1919. At this point, the Volunteer Army of General Denikin was still engaged in the advance it had begun in May, and conditions in south Russia were temporarily brighte r. Ouspensky based himself in Ekaterino dar-a city he came heartily to loathe-and through the intervention of Or age in London made contact with Ma jor F. S. Pinder, the head of the British Economic Mission to Denikin's fo rces. Pinder took Ouspensky on to his staff, even though he had to pay his salary out of his own pocket. Ouspensky's duties consisted chiefly of writing press sum­ maries fo r the British Mission. He moved to Ekaterinodar from Rostov-on­ Don, and from · Ekaterinodar to Novorossisk and back again, a weary pilgrimage up and down the railway line as the fighting swayed to and fro. Either through Ma jor Pinder or via his own lines of communi cation, Ouspensky was by now in fa irly regular contact with Orage, who published in the New A g e a series of his \"Letters from Russi a.\" The first is dated from Ekaterinodar, on July 25, 1919, and is the cri-de-(;oeur of a man who has lost hope in the state of the external wor ld: It is now two years since 1 last saw THE NEW AGE, and 1 do not know what is being said and thought and written in England and what you know. 1 can only gues s.

You do not even know the signific ance of the words, \"living in the old way.\" You have not the necessary perspective; you cannot get away from yourselves and look at yourselves from another point of view. But we have done so long ago. To understand what \"living in the old way\" means, you would need to be here, and to hear people saying, and yourself too, from time to time, \"Shall we ever live again in the old way?\" ... For you this phrase is written in a quite unintelligible language-do not try to understand it! You will surely begin to think that it is something to do with the re-estab lishment of the old regime or the oppre ssion of the working classes, and so on. But in actual fact it means something very simple. It means, for example: when shall we be able to buy shoe-leather again , or shaving-soap, or a box of matches? Ouspensky was deeply marked by the experience of the political revolu­ tion. His insistence on the chasm between his own hard-won understanding and the knowledge of the West where conditions were so totally different, is not merely a literary affectation. The influence of his time with Gurdjieff is clearly evident in the way he tried to explain why the inexperienced can never appreciate the nature of the history of crime. \"We know too much to be able to speak to you on equal terms. We know the true relation of history and words to facts. We know what such words as 'civilisation' and 'culture' mean; we know what 'revolution' means, and 'a Socialist State,' and 'winter' and 'bread ,' and 'stove,' and 'soap,' and many, many more of the same kind.\" The view of history which he elaborated was of a huge biological machine. \"Nations\" and \"States\" were \"big two-dimensi onal creatures\" w,bich existed in an unreal world of \"politics\" and \"economics .\" \"We know now that the whole life of individual men and women is a struggle against these big creatures. We are able to understand without difficulty that a Na tion is a creature standing on a far lower stage of developm ent than individual men and women; it is about on the level of the zoophyte s, slowly m9ving in one direction or the other and consuming one another .\" In Ouspensky's mind the System .which had served him and his companions as a sheet anchor through the storms they had weathered, could explain many of the dementing facts of life in a civil war. He denied \"preparing to set out an esoteric philosop hy,\" but promptly propo sed an exam ination of the \"life of the great forces\" in contemporary Russia. \"We observe primarily ,\" he commented, \"that everything in it acts according to one general rule, which I may call the Law of Opposite Aims and Results. In other words everything leads to results that are contr ary to what people intend to bring about and towards which they strive .\" This is nothing else but Curdjieff's Law of Otherwis e-an d in the life of the Great Forces,"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"168 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE speaking synchronistica lly, the Enantiodromia of C. G. Jung-and Ouspensk y applied it with substantial effect to show that such factors were the real arbiters of history , not the will of impotent man. Supporters of the Great War had not meant to overthrow the monarchy , reformers intended nothing so little as Kerensky's jaineance, the liberals did not mean to encourage Bolshevism. All the independent states which had sprung up since 1917 were in theory an attractive idea, and no doubt they did not mean to fo ster crime and speculati on, but. . . . On his journey from Miner alny Vodi to Rostov and Novorossisk, Ouspensky had passed through \"f our States, each with different laws, diff erent prices, different sorts of police , united only by a single common quality, namely, that without bribes ... you cannot go far.\" Inflation was the chief source of hardship, particularly fo r brainwor kers, who did not rank as \"worke rs\" in the new society and whose wages therefore did not keep pace with rising prices. In Ekaterinodar, supposedly the cheapest place in Russia, the price of bread had doubled in a fortnight. Ouspensky antici­ pated the disbelief of his English audience. You will ask how it is possible to live under such conditi ons. And this is the most occult aspect of the whole question. I will answer fo r mysel f: I personally am still alive only because my boots and my trousers and other articles of clothing -all \"old campai gners\" -are still holding together. When they end their exis­ tence I shall evidently end mine. By the time of his second letter of September 18, Ouspensky had obtained copies of old English newspapers and was more than ever convinced of the utter incomprehension of the world outside Russia. In this letter, in a third dated September 25, and in two undated letters from Ekaterinodar which the New Age published in December, he set about trying to bridge the gap, although with no illusions as to any possible effect. He did not believe, he wrote , that a single voice could have any effect on politics . Anyway, he was no politician . And events had long since passed the point at which anything could be done. \"At pr�ent, while I am writing this, a fire is breaking out and spreading over Italy. The reason for this, as well as for many other things that will happen in Europe, lies in the fact that when peace was made no decision was taken about extinguishing the fire in Russia. \" The fire was, of course, the Bolshevik menace, and Bolshevism was a menace, Ouspensky believed, particularly because the West in general did not understand-as Russia had earlier not unders tood-its real nature . He"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 169 rightly guessed that an influential body of Western opinion was laboring in the grip of an illusion which the Russian intelligentsia had lost in the autumn of1917. This was the confusion of Bolshevism with \"a socialistic and revolutionary movement .\" \"Persons inclined to abstract thinking,\" wrote Ouspensky, \"persist in seeing in Bolshevism not what it actually is, but what it ought to be according to their theoretical deductions .\" He proceeded to enlighten his readers on the history of Russian socialism, and put forward the sweeping condemnation of Bolshevism which he incorpo­ rated in his A New Model of the Universe . He had begun work on the revised version of this book the year before his \"Letters from Russia\" appeared in the New Age, and in it, there is much of the bitterness of this period of famine and despair. In the New Age Ouspensky defined Bolshevism as \"the dictatorship of the criminal elements .\" He proposed a new term for Soviet rule to denote its criminal nature, \"something like 'kakourgocracy' or 'paranomocracy. '\" The weakness of the intelligentsia and its belief that Bolshevism was a real reforming movement had allowed this unnatural phenomenon to come to power. As soon as the Bolsheviks attained a dominant position, they began to attack the intelligentsia, who alone could have penetrated and reformed the movement from within. Ouspensky described with horror how doctors could not prevent the spread of infection because their actions were dictated by Soviets of medical orderlie s; how the press had been virtually supplanted by Soviet news sheets; how \"science, art, literature were put under suspicion and were handed over to the watchful control of illiterate bodies of workmen .\" The good of the proletariat excluded the good of anybody else, and ended by preventing any good at all. Ordinary writing paper cost three pounds ten shillings for twenty-seven sheets, all around were cholera, typhoid, and starvation, and Ouspensky's thoughts were already turning in the direction of the Laws of Manu. Although he published nothing on the subject until 1929, the edition he used appeared in St. Petersburg in 1913, and A New Model of the Universe cites several precepts of the legendary Hindu lawgiver which have a definite application to Ouspensky's view of Russia during the Civil War: Verse 31. Chapter I. For the prosperity of the worlds he created from his mouth, his arms, his thighs and his feet the Brahm in, the Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra. Verse 22 . Chapter VIII . A kingdom peopled mostly by Sudras, filled with godless men and deprived of twice- �rn inhabitants, will soon wholly perish, stricken by hunger and disease."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"170 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE The \"Letters from Russia\" expressed the desperatIon of the times, and Ouspensky was not wholly free from the more panic-stricken speculations which led some White Russians to the delusion of conspiracy-theory politi cs. He saw a devilish German plot behind the Communist successes in China. He made strange and desperate statements like the one about Mrs. Pankhu rst: \"The personal staff of the advocates of Bolshevism is also a peculiar thing. It consists in its greater part of neurasthenics .... The Bolshevik literature was brought over to England by Mrs. Pankhurst. There are na mes that always mean a lot.\" And more sinister still-although in all fairness to Ouspensky it should be said that he appears never to have been an anti-Sem ite-was the reference to \"the right to live,\" \"Le., a written certificate authori sing you to reside in any particular place-a measure which used to be applied before to Jews-{which] is now a rule for everybody . I do not know whom we have to thank for such a brilliant solution of the problem of personal rights, but facts remain facts.\" T he scars caused by the desolation of 1919 never completely healed, and the essentially gentle Ouspensky preserved a hatred for Bolshevism which was all but fanatical . As he wrote his letters to Orage in London, things were going from bad to worse. Allied aid was being withdrawn , and Caucasian partisans were making life difficult for the White forces, which were eventually reduced to about eight thousand men against the sixty­ thousand-strong Red Army. Corrupti on, neglect, debauchery and drunken­ ness sapped the officers. At the beginning of winter, General Wrangel informed Denikin that his army had ceased to exist as a fighting unit. About the same time, Ouspensky described the White headquarters at the filthy and disease-ridden town of Ekaterinodar as \"the most God-forsaken place one can imagine .\" The year since Ouspensky had parted from Gurdjieff had produced internal as well as external chang es. In Ekaterinodar he decided that he had \"acquired a strange confidence, one which I could not define in one word .\" This was a confidence in the complete insignificance of \"the self which we usually know.\" Behind this petty creature of the imaginati on, Ouspensky felt the presence of \"another I\" which would be able to surmount the appal ling disasters which some of his friends had had to face. Two years previously, he wrote, Gurdjieff had asked him whether he could not feel a \"new I\" inside him, and he had been forced to answer no. Now he did feel the presence of this 'T' and knew that it existed definitely as the result of his work with Gurdjieff, not because of greater experience of life. In ordinary circumstanc es, the customary domination of all the irritating small ''I's'' went on; but given a big challenge, Ouspensky felt that his new indiViduality would be able to meet it. A definite result had been attained. In the midst of the squalor and the sickness, Ouspensky gathered around"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE TRAVE LING CIRCUS 171 him a small group and gave a series of lectures on Gurd jieff's System and \"the things from ordinary life which lead up to it.\" He discovered an amount of interest which set him thinking. The ideas \"obviously answered the needs of people who wanted to understand what was taking place both in them and around them .\" The engineer P. came to see him in Ekaterinodar, and Ouspensky tried to improve his \"negative frame of mind\" by emphasizing the distinction which he himself now made between Gurdjieff and the ideas. Gurdjieff had tried to persuade P. to join him in Tifli s; but, like Ouspensky, the engineer resisted Gurdjieff's attempts to lure him back into the fold. Ouspensky's own reasons fo r refusing to go to Tiflis were partly the huge material obstacles and partly the \"very real\" difficul ties which had confronted him in Essentuki. \"My decision to leave G. had cost me very dear and I could not give it up so easily , the more so as all his motives were to be seen.\" By the time winter had begun in earnest, the only considerations which meant anything were those of survival. The Volunteer Army was disin­ tegrati ng. In December, Wrangel began his long retreat on Rostov- on-Don, in which over 200,000 people died. As the military headquarters moved to Rostov, Pinder's Economic Mission moved too, taking with it Ouspensky. In Rostov he met several fo rmer members of the St. Petersburg group and also A. A. Zaharoff, who was completely disillusioned with the Work. The two friends shared quarters in the overcrowded city, and Ouspensky's conversations with Zaharoff seemed to lift the mathematician out of his depression. Once again Zahar off's feelings altered, but he was apparently unable to follow Ouspensky in distinguishing the Work from the person of its teacher. He began making plans to get through to Gurdjieff in Tiflis. The pair of them were living in a bam near Rostov when they were visited for two weeks around Christmas by Carl Bechhofer Roberts (1894-1949) , a talented and irrepressibly cheerful writer connected with Orage 's New Age. He had met Ouspensky in India, possibly at Adyar, and again in St. Petersburg at the outbreak of the war. Bechhofer Roberts had translated some of Ouspensky's articles fo r the New Age, and was surveying the situation as a freelance journalist. He received a rude awake ning into the rigors of life in a country at civil war: Ouspensky showed me his possessions. They consisted of the clothes he was wearing (principally a rather ragged frock-coat. a remnant of fo rmer fortunes), a couple of extra shirts and pairs of socks, one blanket, a shabby overcoat, an extra pair of boots , a tin of coffee, a razor, a file and whetston� J and a towel. He assured me that he considered himself excepti onally fortunate to have so much left. On the next day we transf erred our belongings to a new dwelling he had"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"172 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE discovered for us. This consisted of two small rooms over a kind of barn ... While staying there, Bechhofer Roberts managed to obtain a quantity of coal, and the three celebrated with vodka, manufactured by Ouspen sky­ much to Zaharoff 's dismay-f rom some neat spirit he had found in the barn, adulterated with orange peel. A hilarious conversation ensued during which Ouspensky told stories of his youth in Moscow. Bechhof er Roberts introduced an unwelcome note of sobriety into the proceedings by wondering where they would all be in a month's time. Both Russians turned on the English journalist, and told him that the uncertainty of the times made it impossible to guess. A month later, Bechhof er Roberts entered in his diary the answer to his question: \"I am at Novorossisk, writing this. Ouspensky is, 1 believe, at Ekaterinodar, trying to get his wife away to the comparative safety of the seashore . I do not know if 1 shall ever see him again, or where . Zaharov died three days ago of small-pox, contracted at Rostov at the very time when we were living with him. And the Bolsheviks are at Rostov .\" The year which ended so disastrously fo r Ouspensky in the north Caucas us had begun quite favorably for Gurdjieff in the south. By the end of 1918, the Turks had withdrawn from Georgia, and the collap se of Germany led to the evacuation of German troops in the Transcaucas us. The small nations of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan noisily obtained their independence . When Gurdjieff and his little party arrived in Ti£lis in January 1919, the population of the Georgian capital-al ready a melting pot of races-had long been augmented by streams of refugees from the fighting. Bechhofer Roberts reached the town fifteen months later, and observed that it had \"become a centre fo r what was left of Russian society . One found the strange st people there . Poets and painters from Petrograd and Moscow, philosop hers, theosop hists, dance rs, singers, actors and actresses. Paul Yashvili, the leader of the younger Georgian poets, was once moved, after a hearty meal, to climb on a chair in the Cafe International , in the chief boulevard of Tiflis, and declare , in a loud voice , that 'Not Paris, but Tiflis, is the centre of the world's culture . '\" Olga and Thomas de Hartmann were two of the additions to the cultural life of Tiflis. Olga had a trained voice and began to sing in the Opera, while her husband became Professor of Composition at the Conser vatoire. Their connection with the theater resulted in a meeting which was to have considerable consequence for the spread of Gurdjieff's ideas. The scene painter for the first operatic production in which Thomas de Hartmann took part was an artist called Alexander de Salzma nn, whom de Hartmann had"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE T R A VEL IN Gel R C U s 173 met in Munich, and whose wife Jeanne was a teacher of Dalcroze Eurythmi cs. Alexan der de Salzmann was born in Georgia in 1874. His family was of Baltic origin and his father had been a Councillor of State. The son's youth was eventful and is said to have included a kidnapping by brigands; but as de Salzma nn's joker-like temperament rivaled Gurdjieff's in the practice of making fictitious claims about his personal history, we should beware of taking every such story literally . Another trait he shared with his Master-to­ be was versatility; the French writer Michel Random described him as \"enthusiastic about everything ... as interested in Chinese script and calligraphy as in Sanskrit, as in studies in rhythm and music, as in canons of proportion and investigations into the Golden Numbe r.\" Carl Zigrosser remembers him at the end of the 1920s: His face with its weather-beaten skin, sunken cheeks and gaps and stumps of teeth, was not easily forgotten. He told me that he had lost his teeth through a fall from a cliff in the Caucasus Mountains when he was chief fo rest ranger to some Russian Grand Duke. Fortunately he fell into a tree and saved his life. In spite of his artistic sophistication, there was something wild and savage in him, a breath of his native Caucasus perha ps, in his taste in food, in the primitiveness of his personal wants. His method of shaving was simplicity itself: he took a dry razor and scraped his face. Even this was a conce ssion ... After studying in THlis and Moscow, de Salzmann left Russia fo r Munich where he worked for many years as an artist and became friendly with Rilke and Kandinsky. De Salzmann became a member of the Jugendstil group , and contributed copiously to the periodicals Jugend and Simplicissim us. In its early numbers, Jugend rarely carried fewer than eight of his drawings or paintings a year. De Salzmann used an extraordinary variety of styles which embraced a mannered Art Nouveau, grotesquerie, carica ture, and a superbly blatant posterlike techn ique. By late 1909 his output in Jugend had fallen off consider ably, and in 1911 he left Munich for Hellerau near Dresden, where Emile Jaques- Dalcroze (1865-1950) had founded an institute for teaching his system of Eurythmics. At Hellerau, de Salzmann developed another of his many talents. He was in charge of lighting the extremely advanced theater designed by the architect Tessenow, and invented for the purpose, a unique system of diffused lighting which captiva ted, among others, Paul Claudel. One friend of Claudel thought that the playwright had been bewitched by de Salzma nn, and to Jaques-Da lcroze he seemed \"a real artist!\" He was something of an enfant terrib le. Conceiving a dislike for Hegener, the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"174 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE German translator of ClaudeI's play, L'Annonce fa ite li Marie, de Salzmann proposed a walk in the forest to resolve a dispute about the productio n. There he had tied Hegener to a tree and returned to direct rehearsals to his own satisfaction. At Hellerau he met his wife, Jeanne Allemand, who was a pupil of Jaques-Dalcroze and, like him, from Geneva. In 1914 the couple left Germany for Moscow, where de Salzmann's system of lighting was in use, and by 1919 the fortunes of war had brought them back to Alexander de Salzmann's birthpla ce. Some time after he and de Hartmann renewed their acquaintance at the TiBis Opera, a conversation took place between them and their wives about the necessity of a spiritual director. This resulted in the de Salzmanns' introduction to GurdjietI, who was impr essed. \"He is a very fine man,\" he is reported to have said, \"and she-is intelligent .\" Jeanne de Salzmann , who was only twenty-two or twenty-th ree, was schooled by the Dalcroze Method and very much in love with Art. In her attempts to write, she began to find that all her ideas seemed to derive from what she had read elsewhere ; that when honed down, there was only a scrap which originated in her personal inspirati on. She examined the works of the great masters to see where their secret lay. But the great composers and the great writers turned out on inspection to be in their degree as derivative as herself. Why had man so little he could call his own? Her disillusion with the human creative powers which she had idolized became acute-and suddenly here was GurdjietI, a teacher who could explain exactly why man could do nothing of himself. For a decade longer a few torches would glimmer on the shrine of the great god Art. But the days of his worship were numbered, and the bubble containing the first fine enthusiasms of the tum of the century, when artists became mystics and strove for the Absolute, had been pricked by the First World War. The visionary time had passed, and the visionaries were growing tired. Life had so definitely triumphed over art-and to prove the horrors of this vile dominion, Rheims Cathedral lay in rubble and the Cloth Hall at Ypres was burned-that it became increas ingly difficult to believe in the new world which the new art had hoped to inaugurate . The alternatives appeared to be either an immersion in \"events\" or a withdrawal from them; and to those of a quietist disposition, GurdjietI's teaching had a direct appeal. As GurdjietI himself wrote, \"among the inhabitants of TiBis, many people had been deeply affected by the change in their conditio ns of life and felt the need to tum to other values.\" Some version of Jeanne de Salzmann's problem was to strike many intellectuals after the War, and events in Tillis foreshadowed GurdjietI's future success. GurdjietI arrived one day in Mme. de Salzmann's class to watch her pupils pursue the search for rhythmical beauty according to the system of"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 175 Dalcroze. He was invited to demon strate his \"sacred danc es\" and the movements he had taught at Essentuki . Gurd jieff lined the girls up and made them practice milit ary tur ns, which he said were an esse ntial preliminary to any work on \"Sa cred Gymnastics .\" Curiously, the class took to it, and Gurd jieff' s movements fo rmed a part of the Dalcroze pupils' next public demonst ration . Then Gurd jieff decided that there must be a second perf ormance, which was to consist entirely of his movements with no Dalcroze at all. Rubbing salt in the wound, he directed Mme. de Salzmann to tell her pupils that they would all be paid. To the Dalcroze students this was the last straw, and about two-thirds walked out, but somehow, enough were persuaded to take part. \"With those who are left,\" Gurd jieiI announced, \"we're going to be able to wor k. \" During the summer of 1919, the de Hartmanns traveled and gave concerts . Gurd jieff returned to his fa vorite trade as a carp et deal er. His brother Dmitri arrived from the north with the news that most of the val­ uables which the group had left hidden in their house at Essentuki had been discovered and either destroyed or disperse d. Olga de Hartmann was sent on a hair-ra ising solo journey to recover what she could . The expedition was doubly fr ightening because-regard less of the high proba­ bility that she would not return-she had never before even walked unacc ompanied in the street. She went, fo rtified by a box conta ining a pill which Gurdjieff said was to be taken in case of grave necessity, and soon returned to THlis having managed to salvage two of Gurd jieff's carpets and a fe w personal possessions. She rea lized that neither the carpets nor her own effects were importa nt: \"They were just a pretext to have me thrown , � n� into life, to see how I could manage in conditio ns far more difficult 'Sian anyo ne, even Mr. Gurdjieff, could imagine in advance .\" In the autumn of 1919, Gurd jieff's small group-the Stoerneva ls, the de Hartmanns and the de Salzmanns-gathered in Tif lis. Gurd jieiI's carpet business had appare ntly prospered so well that he could now affo rd to give a lQore permanent fo rm to his activitie s. Newly independent Georgia was intensely chauv inistic, and well disposed to offe r support fo r vaguely cultural movements which were assumed to confer stat us. Gurd jieff directed his pupils to puzzle out a name which would describe his proposed establi shment. \"Afterwards it was clear to me,\" writes Tho mas de Hartma nn, \"that Mr. Gurd jieff had decided on this name some time earlier, but . . . he fo rced us to look fo r it, pushed us, tried to bring us closer to the main thought, till this word emerged .

Exercises for the development of will, memory, attention, hearing, thinking, emotion, instinct, and so on.\" Ouspensky found attached to the prospectus a list of specialist teachers, which included his own name, as well as those of P. the engineer, and Joukoff, another disaffected pupiL None of the three had any intention of going ,to Tiflis at all. Ouspensky himself resisted Gurdjieff's invitation to join him. \"I realised, of course, that it meant that G. was obviously obliged to give some sort of outward fo rm to his work . . . I also realised that behind this outward fo rm stood the same thing as before and that this could not change . I was doubtful only of my own ability to adapt myself . . .\" Ouspensky had already made his separation between the man Gurd jieff and his ideas. Now he made another between the form and the content of Gurdjieff's teaching. He considered the idea of the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man to be of merely incidental significance . And despite all his misgivings about the eventual outcome of Gurdjieff's altered tactics, he was prepared to overcome them for the sake of a-still obscure --common cause. He was \"confide nt,\" he write s, \"that I should soon have to meet G. again.\" In Tiflis, the house where Gurdjieff and his imme diate followers were living rapidly became too small for the crowd of pupils who wanted to take part in the movements, so Gurd jieff extracted a promise from the Georgian authorities to provide a building for his work . The fulfilment of this undertaking was perpetually delayed-u ntil de Salzmann published a cartoon of Gurdjieff and his followers cast upon the streets. The result was a sizable house with a hall for the movements. A piano----deliberately not a good one--was acquired for de Hartmann to play. The members of the Institute were set to making furniture to seat sixty people. Every evening the movements took place. A pattern was emerging, which grew familiar in the days of Gurdjieff's Institute at the chateau du Prieure. Later Carl Bechhofer Roberts even thought that \"to one who like myself knew the baby institute at Tiflis, there is little new about Fontaineble au.\" As Ouspensky saw, Gur<!iieff seemed now to be basing his efforts on \"arC-although he might well have added the category of manual labor. The theatrical connections of the de Hartmanns and the de Salzmanns dictated another outward form of activity. Gurdjieff was given a room in the Tiflis Opera, and he announced that they would begin work on his ballet The Struggle Iff the Magic ians, which had been advertised in St. Pe-"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 177 tersburg. He began to dictate the scenario, and his fo llowers started work on the staging. De Salzmann designed a stage set, and de Hartmann wrote the music fo r the first act. For the second act, Gu rdj ieff began to whistle music which de Hartmann took down . It was clear that there was no real prospect of staging the ballet, as the income of the Institute could not even have financed costumes. What then was the point? Work . The Institute itself, the movements, the pro ject fo r the ballet: everything was intended to provide a matrix fo r \"work on oneself. \" The ethic is embodied in de Hartma nn's story of how Gurdjieff made a dummy supposedly fo r use in The Struggle of the Magicia ns. At one point in that magical battl e, the scenario calls fo r the dummy to glow with light and fade. Gurdjieff contrived the effect with a rheostat he had made him self; but the morning after having demonst rated his ingenuity, he was discovered by Mme. de Hartmann smashing the dummy with an axe . \"We have made it,\" he told her, \"so we do not need it any mor e.\" Christmas 1919 was celebrated in humble style by Gurd jieff and his fo llow ers. The Institute fa iled to cover its expenses, and no one had any time left from Gurd jieff's strenuous program to earn money. Meanwhi le, even in TiHis, which had at first seemed a sanctuary, conditions of lif e were unsettl ed. The Georgian government was expert at nothing but malad­ ministration and linguistic conf usion. In 1919 it had issued banknotes in denominations betw een 50 kopecks and 500 roubl es. By the beginning of 1921, the face value of currency was anything up to 100,000 roubles. When in the spring of 1920 Gurd jieff let his Institute dissolve, it wa s clear that if he were to continue his work, it would have to be abroad . Before his activities moved into a new pha se, he was visied by Carl :Bechh ofer Robe rts, who had escaped from Rostov-on-Don a week before it fe el to the Red Army on January 11. He passed through Ekaterinodar and requisitioned a room fo r Ouspensky and his fa mily if they succeeded in lea Ving Rostov . He covered the melancholy retreat of the White fo rces to Ekaterinodar and Novorossisk on the coas t, observing with horror the corruption and chaos of the emigrat ion, the bribery which alone secured a passage by regular steamer, the incompetence with which the official embarkation was administer ed. \"Ho wever ,\" he noted, \"a lot of decent people did get away, Ouspensky and his fa mily (rescued with difficulty from a suburb of Ekaterinodar) among them .\" Ouspensky was more fo rtunate then his benef actor, Major Pinder, who had been captured by the Red Army in Rostov and condemned to dea th. The sentence was, howev er, never executed , and in the spring of 1920 Pinder was able to visit Gurdjieff. Around April, Bechhof er Rob erts reached TiHis also. He carried a letter of introduction from Ouspensky to the man from whom the writer had not yet quite been able to esca pe. Bechhofer frequented Bohemian circles which he entered through the"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"178 THE HARMONIOUS CIR CLE friendship of the Georgian poet, Paolo Yashvili. One' afternoon he found himself sitting at a cafe with Yashvili and a collection of poets, sculptors and emigre politicia ns; with them was \"a curio us individual named Georgei Ivanovitch Gurdjieff. \" He had a circle in Moscow in the old days, and many members of it had followed him to the Caucasus in 1917 and wandered about with him ever since. He was still surrounded by this entourage of philosoph ers, doctors, poets and dancers. He was not exploiting them; on the contrary, several of them were living on his diminishing means. And by them all he was esteemed, almost wor shipped, as a guide to the eternal mysteries of the universe. . . . He was a man of striking appearance . Short, dark and swarthy, with penetrating and clever eyes; no one could be in his company for many minutes without being impressed by the force of his personality. One did not need to believe him to be infallib le, but there was no denying his extraordinary aU­ round intelligence . Bechhof er had been afraid that Gurdjieff would \"talk theosophy\" to him, but was relieved to find that his new acquaint ance was content to show him around Tiflis. Together they went to \"many obscure restaurants, Georgian and Persian, where we ate appetising food in sometimes unappetising surroundings .\" Gurdjieff's gastrono mic expertise summoned up \"unac­ customed and piquant dishes\" for his Engli sh guest, and Bechhofer was treated to a luxurious hour or two in a bathhouse run by a \"tall, bearded Persian\" where the guests lay in stone basins of sulphurous water and were soaped and massaged by the attenda nt. In the evenings Bechhof er sometimes dropped in at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man to watch rehearsals for The Struggle of the Magici ans. Gurdjieff was quite open about the provenance of his ballet. The dances, he declared, were based on movements and gestures which had been handed down by traditions and paintings in Tibetan monaster ies, where he had been. The music, also, was of mysterious tradition. He himself could not play a note, and knew nothing of composition; but the academician who interpreted his ideas assured me that he had learned more of the theory of {Ilusic from Georgei Ivanovitch than in any of the schools. Th e decorations and costumes were also the work of Georgei Ivanovitch; he had even painted and sewn them himself. Although Bechhof er later called one of Gurdjieff's Tiflis lectures \"a vapid and half-hearted affair,\" this was not really changin g his tune; for the"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 179 Gurd jieffhe had met and acco mpanied to restaurants and the baths was not the teach er but the Greek Armenian enjoying the pleasures of his native land. Bechhof er had been sadly disillusioned by his experiences with Indian Mahat mas, and Paul Selver of the New Age circle described him as invincibly pre judiced \"again st all fo rms of higher thoug ht. \" The Gurdjieff he fo und in Tiflis was the homme sensu el . But was this any more the \"real\" Gurdjieff than the puritanical Master whom other witnesses describe? The only other outside report of Gurdjieff in Tiflis in 1919 is a hazy reference contained in an attack by the Catholic Roger Bezault who claims to have information from an acquaintance who knew Gurd jieff in this period . \"In Armenian circles themselves ,\" Bezault write s, \"Signor Gurdjian [sic} did not rej oice , on the moral plane at least, in an enviable reputati on.\" What this implies is a matter fo r guesswork ; yet if there is any substance in the allegation , it is merely another example of the equivocal appearance which Gurd jieff displayed to the outside world . What, anyway, was morality ? He had explained to Ouspensky in St. Petersburg that in his view morality was a relative affair, except fo r a man who was \"working on himse lf. \" Then moral questions resolved themselves according to whether or not an event helped him in his struggl es. The values of the Work were the only admissible standar ds. What served the aims of the Work was good, what hindered, evil. The individual disciple had to decide how he should react to Gurdjieff ' s apparently capricious or cruel conduct. The single assumption required of him was that he should remember that, in all cases, the Master acted fo r his benef it. So how do we take Bechhof er's report that when he left Tiflis, Gurd jieff was growing \"weary\" of his pupils and looked fo rward to a journey to Europe or to the East without them? Is this another case of the going to Persia with which he had frig htened the de Hartma nns? The task of the pupil, as Thomas de Hartmann understood it, was to stick to Gurd jieff whatever the cost, Dl aking use of the unpleasant parts of the experience fo r \"work .\" But this did not mean that it was always clear when to obey or when to disobey the Teach er's command. In the spring of 1920, Gurdjieff suddenly began to act toward de Hartmann in a hypercritical and imperious fa shion, and ordered him to abandon the work with the Mos cow Art Theatre which had become his livelihood . De Hartmann decided that he could not possibly give up his only source of income -that the test here was of his ability to make a logical decision fo r himse lf, not of whet her he could obey his Master's every word . He continued his association with the Theatre , whose personnel Gurd jieff affected to despise, and at a concert de Hartmann gave in Tiflis, he was not surprised to see Gurdjieff in the audience and to hear his favorable verdlct -although the entire staff of the Moscow Art Theatre was present. The increasing difficulties of lif e around him again fo rced Gurdjieff to"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"180 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE move. Georgia was not attacked by the Bolsheviks tintil the beginning of 1921, but the perpetual misgovernment of the country and the incessant squabbling with the neighboring -and equally bellicos e--<x) untries of Armenia and Azerbai jan, had ruined economic life and made physical survival problematic. Distributing his capital among his followers in the form of carpets, Gurdjieff set off for the Black Sea port of Batum. For a second time, it was an expedition on foot; and as always, Gurdjieff made use of the hazards of the route to drive his points home. For examp le: there were fo ur horses which the men usually handled. Once there appeared a large cleft in the ground, one particularly difficult to negotiate while leading an animal. A horse was taken from its male keeper and given to Mme. de Stoerneva l-who had just given birth to a son in TiHis and was in any case not greatly taken with the Work-to lead around or over the obstacle under Gurdjieff' s gaze. When the traveling circus reached Batum, about thirty people took ship for Constantinop le, where they arrived in June 1920. Almost immediately, Gurdjieff and his companions were again in desperate straits; for the precious carpets which were to serve instead of worthless Georgian currency as negotiable funds had almost all been confiscated en route by one of the many makesh ift armies which roamed the Caucasian states. Constantinople was not the easiest of cities for a refugee. About the time of Gurd jieff' s arrival, the British Gener al Harrington was reporting to Winston Churchill in London that \"the streets of Constantinople are crowded with Russian s-all without mone y.\" The crowds which concen­ trated on the former Russian embassy were \"literally starving.\" The How of emigrants had been in progre ss since the defeat of General W rangel at the beginning of 1920, and among those who had been some months in Constantinople was Ouspensky. He was living with his family in one of the refugee camps on the Princes Isles in the Bosphorus, supporting himself by tutoring in mathematics and teaching English to Russia n exiles. He had also started a series of lectures on Gurdjieff's ideas at the Russky Mayak, or White Russian Club, in Pera, the European quarter of Constantino ple. Not for the last time, Gurdjieff found a group of people prepared by Ouspensky to cooperate in his designs. Once more Gurdjieff threw himself into commercial undertakin gs. He mentions the sale of a ship and a deal in caviar. He also returned to his activities as a \"physician-hypnotist\" which involved him in an improbable relati onship with a Turkish pasha who was determined that his son should bec ome a champion wrestler. The de Hartmanns began to earn money by giving concer ts. In the intervals wrested from the struggle for existence, Gurdjieff attended to the group which Ouspensky had formed and-in"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 181 obedience to his resolve to forget \"all former difficult ies\"-had made over to his Master on his arrival from Batum . Ouspensky devoted himself to helping Gurdjieff prepare to open an Institute in Constantinople . The relationship was interesting and satisfying for him, but it continued with mounting unease; and there is some evidence that Gurdjieff already enjoyed a generally sinister reputation in emigre society . Boris Mouravieff met him at this period and observed one of the schemes he devised for making money for his Institute . This was to associate with it a celebrated clairvoyant who was married to a Russian diplomat. \"From the first contacts ,\" claim s Mou ravieff, \"she refused peremptorily to have anything to do with him.\" Mouravieff implies that some darkly occult motive lay behind the lady's refusal to cooperate, but says no more about why Gurdjieff seemed to be making his bow in the role of Black Magician . He clearly intended to continue the pattern begun in Tiflis. In the months before his Constantinople Institute opened in the autumn of 1920, work resumed on the scenario of The Struggle of the Magicians, and once more Ouspensky and the others were made to rack their brains in the service of the Master's intenti ons. Ouspensky has described how they spent a whole night translating a dervish song for the ballet. \"This translation took the form of G. recalling the Persian verses, sometimes repeating them to himself in a quiet voice , and then translating them for me into Russian . After a quarter of an hour, let us say, when I had completely disappeared beneath forms, symbols and assim ilations, he said: 'There now, make one line out of that. '\" . The composition which resulted contains a statement of the Laws of seven and Three, together with an affirmation of the sacred ness of all points of vi�� It is twenty-two lines long, and to this day it remains unfinished. In the ballet the dervish sings this hymn to the fountain of his gnosis in the hubbub of an Eastern marketpla ce, and a stage direction breaks in where Gurd jieff and Ouspensky were unable to cudgel their brains any further to conceal the missing ending in the brouhaha round a quack doctor. The ballet itself is not really a ballet, but more of a symbolic play with Gurdjieff's movements and music. From one point of view, it is the purest melodram a; but from another, The Struggle of the Magicians has a certain beauty irrespective of its effectiveness in stage ter ms.

Next, the audience is shown· the cave of the Black Ma gician , whose pupils are ugly and def ormed and who dance in a fre nzied and uncontrolled fa shion. The Black Magician casts a spell on Zeinab compelling her to submit to Gaff ar, but in the last act, the White Magician magically destroys his evil counterpart and fo rces Gaffar and Zeinab to come to him. They arrive like zombies and are aroused by the Magician . A great reconciliation takes place with a final benediction from the White Magician and a prayer to the Creator to help men to avoid involun tary act ions. In Gurd jieff's terminology there is no \"ma gic\" in the sense of leaping the bounds of natural law. But someone who has overcome mechanical ness and can do consciously -is a real magician . \"Black Magic\" Gurdjieff defined as \"a fa lsification , an imitation of the outward appearance of 'doing. '\" In this way the Black Magician and his pupils are the hollow replicas of the Whi te. The White and Black schools also represent the struggle between the fo rces of mechanica lness and the will to be. What has happened to Zeinab when she succu mbs to the spell of the Black Magician is that she has fal len back into the machine state and is react ing automatical ly. Gur dj ieff intended that the same pupils should dance the parts of the pupils of both White and Black Magician s. Although Ouspensky possessed a text, his fo llowers rarely perf ormed the play because Mm e. Ouspensky disapproved of the move­ ments of the Black Magician's scho ol. On the other hand, Gur dj ieff himself once seriously frightened at least one American pupil by fo rcing her to perform the depraved antics of the Bla ck corps de ballet . Despite the stimulus which Ouspensky derived fr om working with Gurdjieff again, his doubts about their association were rekindl ed. \"Gradu­ ally,\" he recor ds, \"the same difficulties arose before me as in Esse ntuk i,\" and so as not to hinder Gu rdj ieff , he returned to the Prince's Isles. Although he had withdrawn fr om all active cooperat ion, he continued to see Gu rdjieff, and they went together to visit the Mevlevi dervi shes. Gurd jieff explained that the whirling dance was an exerci se based on counting, like the movements he had started to teach at Ess entuki. After giving Gurdjieff a couple of months to establish him self, Ouspensky resumed his lectures in the Russky Mayak, where his audience soon reached such proport ions that he needed a larger room.

The acc ount of the period which he gives in his autobiograph y, Witness (1962), must have been discreetly glossed over, fo r later, he admitted that his first introduction to the name Gurd jieff came in a notification from the Government of India that a notorious Russian agent was on his way. His original version was that he had been invited to meet a mysterious oc cultist and explorer by a Theosophically inclined fr iend, the Turkish Prince Sabahe ddin. The young intelligence officer had recently become interested in hypnotism and was preoccupied with theories of a fifth dimension, both topics admirably suited to Gurd jieff's unusu al point of view. Gurdjieff explained various hypnotic phenomena as control exercised over the finer substances in nature , and endorsed Bennett's guess that his fifth dimension was the dimension of fr ee will. Such free will could only be atta ined in this present life, he continued , and if Bennett wanted to attain this higher state he must start to work fo r it now . However , it is more than likely that a prof essional interest in the former Tsarist agent preceded Bennett's intellectual absorption in his philosophy . At all events, he attended a session of the Inst itute in Pera. He watched the pupils, dressed in white with colored sashes, perform movements, including the one known as \"The Initiation of a Prie stess.\" Then Gurdjieff gave the \"St op\" exercise in an impressive and dram atic fo rm: Everyone lined up at the back of the room while Hartmann played a series of chords. Gurd jieff shouted an order in Russian and all the dancers jumped in the air and rushed at full speed towards the specta tors. Suddenly Gurd jieff in a loud voice shouted \"Stop!\" and everyone froze in his trac ks. Most of the dancers, being carried by the momentum of their rush, fe ll and rolled over and over on the floor. As they came to rest they became rigid like people in a cataleptic trance . There was a long silence. Another visitor to the Institute in Pera was the German writer, Alphons Paquet, who recorded his impressions in his book, Delphische Wan­ derung en . Paquet (1881-19 44) is not well known outside Germany. He was a Quaker and a poet in the tradition of Whitman . In the years before 1921, he had published several books on Russia and the Revo lution, and was now on an expedition through Turkey and the Balkans in an eff ort to escape the \"attnospher e of pessimism and occulti sm\" in Germany, and in the hope of recov ering some inspiration from the clarity of classical Greece .

It was Alexander de Salzma nn, whom he had known in Mu nich before the war. That evening Paquet was introduced to the Institute. It was in the ground floor of a maze-like house swarm ing with Russians. I got to know the Director of the school, a Caucasian who in the course of journeys lasting several years in the mountainous lands of Central Asia, visited monasteries and learned the ritua ls, dances and knowl­ edge of the monks. This man maintained that the home of wonders was not India. He talked of the Pamir highlands , of which the West scarcely knows the names, and of wh ose marvels the explorers will never tire of telling. I watched the danc es, which his pupils practised in this shabby, black-an d-white-tiled hall ; there were scarcely several dozen men and women. . . . In the curriculum of this Institute there were lectures from the tradi tions of Asian schools on religious myths, on rhyth m, on the Law of the Octave, on the science of numbers and everything that has to do with the Cabala and the magical arts . Here one learned an interpretation of the remarkable stone monuments known as dolmens which stretch in an enormous belt fr om the central parts of Asia through the Cauca sus, South Russia and Poland , over the northern moors to Scandinavia and England; which can be fo und in Brittany, in the Pyrenees, and North Africa, and end their pattern in Egypt; the secret symbols of an enlightened race fr om Bactrian and Atlantean prehist ory-f orgotten by astronomy and geology .... The Pera Institute did not last very long. Once more political conditions looked threat ening. As Gurdjieff wrote, \"The wiseacr ing of the Young Turks began to have a peculiar smell ,\" and the ringmaster had seen his show stopped too often to commit himself premature ly. At the beginning of the summer of 1921, Gurd jieff closed the Institute. His best-qualified pupils were placed in charge of groups in Asiatic coastal districts . Gurd jieffhim self began planning to move to Germany, which seemed to him, \"owing to its central position and cultural level, \" to provide the most hop eful field fo r his activiti es. Undoubtedly the connections of the de Salzmanns influenced this choice, and judging fr om his later remarks about the Depression in the United States, Gurd jieff may well have picked on Germany because of the prevailing conditions of material hardship . He tried to persuade Ouspensky to come, but Ouspensky -probably with the conventional White Russian prej udice aga inst the Germa ns-had no wish to join him, and in June had a stroke oflu ck which made it possible fo r him to act independently .

Ouspensky replied to his unknown publisher, one Claude Bragdon, thanking him fo r the translation , but prote sting that Tertium Organum was \"to a certain extent my weakne ss. \" He asked whether Bragdon could help him and his family to reach Eng land or the Un ited State s. This was beyond the American's powers, but a second stroke of luck was in store . On May 14, 1921, Bragd on, in Wash ington, received a cable fr om Viscountess Rothermere, the wife of the powerful Eng lish press bar on. It read : TERTIUM ORGANUM INTERESTS ME PASSIONATELY. DESIRE VERY MUCH TO MEET YOU IF POSSIBLE. LEAVING ENGLAND END OF MONTH . Lady Rothermere fo llowed up her enthusiasm with a visit to Ouspensky's publisher, which resulted in a cable of 100 pounds to Ouspensky in Constantinople and another of Lady Rot hermere's telegrams to the author of the book which so engros sed her. This one read : DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR BOOK TERTIUM ORGANUM WISH MEET YOU NEW YORK OR LONDON WILL PAY ALL EXPENSES. There remained the problem of visas. These were hard to secure fo r refug ees, and eventually J. G. Bennett used his authority to obtain the necessary permits. He was unable to perform the same service fo r Gurdj ieff, who was probably still dogged by his reputation as a spy. Not until August were Ouspensky's papers at last in order; and by that time, Gu rdj ieff had reached Germany. Gurd jieff's party arrived in Berlin in the early summer of 1921. It included the de Salzman ns, the de Hartman ns, and Mme. Ouspensky with her daughter and grandchildre n. The Stoernevals had been sent home to Finland to sell their property, and rejoined Gurdjieff somewhat later in Ber lin. A large hall was hired in the suburb of Schma rgendorf as a temporary headquar ters, and Gurdjieff started to travel through Germany to inspect various possible sites fo r establishing an Inst itute. The period which the trav eling circus spent in Berlin lasted until June 1922 and seems to have been something of a hiatus in the develo pment of Gurd jieff's activiti es. Thomas de Hartmann was \"sure that when we arrived in Berlin even Mr. Gurd jieff did not know what would occur there and in which directions we would have to turn our efforts. \" Gurd jieff's activities in the latter half of 1921 dissolve into the shadows of general state ments. There are some stray pieces of evidence which suggest that Gurd jieff's ideas did filter through to German mystical circle s. In a draft of his Third Series, written in the mid-1930s, Gurd jieff talks of a group of fo llowers in Bavaria; nothing else is known fo r certain of these fo llowers . Gurd jieff's party arrived in Berlin as one small group of refugees in the immense exodus from Soviet Russia. The capitals of the Russian emigration were initially Berlin and Far is, and to a lesser extent Mun ich and Sofia. The"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Russians brought with them the mystical traditions of their homeland and a hatred of Bolshevism which was often couched in terms of religious fanatic ism. All too often this was coupled with a paranoid distaste for Jews, who were seen as the representatives of the new materia list society which had overturned Holy Russia. It is well known that the notorious anti­ Semitic forgery, The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, was brought from Russia in the baggage of White office rs. Defeated Germ any-as Alphons Paquet observed -was itself riddled with occultism of every descri ption, and also inclined to manufactqre conspiracy-theories which blamed the Jews for the evils attending the defeat of the Fatherlan d. Disgruntled emigre politicians of the Russian right wing fo und a ready hearing in Germany; and Munich in the early 1920s saw a notable instance of this combination when Alfred Rosenberg and other refugees from the Revolution gathered around the circleS-incl uding Sebottendorff 's Thule Bund- which preached a mystical nationalism. So much is perfectly true. * It is therefore well within the bounds of possibility that Gurdjieff's ideas did interest some Germans whose eyes were fixed on what they imagined to be spiritual value s. It is even possible that his ideas penetrated to the Nazi hierarchy. Hitler, Himmler, and Hess were all mystics of one or another description-Rudolf Hess was a devotee of Rudolf Steiner -and among Alfred Rosenberg's contacts in the Russian emigration, there were doubt­ less several who had heard of Gurdji eff. I have examined in detail much of the evidence relating to Nazism and the occult and found no support for the idea that Gurdjieff had any direct contact with any of the more prominent Nazis . There is, howev er, one consistent rumor which is far removed from notions of an occult conspir acy and is even fairly likely . This is that Alfred ilosenberg attempted to practice the ideas of Gurd jieff . . I have myself talked to a former Nazi party member who once lived in the Same house as Rosenberg and who confirmed that Rosenberg was interested in the ideas of Gurdjieff with the words, \"that was his private study .\" More than this he did not know. However, there is a further piece of evidence contained in an attack on Rudolf Steiner by Gregor Schwartz- Bostunitch. Schwa rtz-Bostunitch was an emigre who had been born Grigori Bostunitch in Kiev in 1883. In Russia he published articles on Rasputin and Freemasonry, and, after the Revoluti on, fled to Germany where he pecided that he was an Aryan, changed his name to Schwart z-Bostunitch, and soon became the chief Nazi propagan dist against occultism, Anthroposophy, Freemasonry, and the Jews. A talent for personal survival led him to switch allegiance from Rosenberg to Himmler, and he ended his career as an SS Standarten fohr er. He was beyond doubt lunatic, and had more than * For a discussion of Russian and German occultism and their conjunction after the First World War, see my The Occult Establishment (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court, 1976)."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"TH E TRAVE LING CIRCU S 187 dabbled in the cults like Anthroposophy which he later attacked. In his pamphlet, Doktor Steiner ein Schwindler wie keiner (1930), he claims that \"my first Teacher in esoteric matters-that was in the Caucasus in 1917-18-- warned me against Steiner.\" Possibly there were other esoteric teachers in the Caucasus in 1917, but it seems probable that Bostunit ch is referring to Gurdjieff, who roundly condemned all \"theosoph ism,\" \"an­ throposo phism,\" and other occultisms as teach ings which helped to deprive man of the small percentage of genuine humanity he had contrived to retain. If this is so, there is a strong possibility that the ideas of Gurdjieff were brought to Rosenberg either by Bostunitch himsel f, or by similar characters in the under world of the Russian emigrat ion. Rosenberg might, of course, have made contact with the ideas in Russia, or through his first wife, Hilda Leesmann, who was herself a dancer and a pupil of Jules d'U ndine, a friend of Dalcroze . It is probable that Rosenberg did belong to Gurdjieff's elusive Bavarian group, but there is nothing to show that he made contact with the ideas when Gurdjieff was touring Germany in 1921-he might not have become interested until Gurdjieff's German visits began in the late 1920s. And, it is doubtful whether any other of the Nazi leade rs-with the possible exception of Hess-would have had the impulse or the application to attend to Gurdji eff. The activities of Gurdjieff remain in the unmapped hinterland of the Russian emigration-w here almost anything might have happ ened. In later years Gurdjieff was always extremely sensitive about offending the police. His circumspection extended to the most scrupulous observation of the rules governing the amount of fuel in automobiles entering Paris, and it is unlikely that an emigre in a precarious position and with a dubious past \"woul d risk being deported by associating with subversive politicians . .. Curdj ieff s chief German contacts were probably with the circles of artists and intellectuals who were attracted to his ideas like moths to a candle, and the single episode of which we know anything before the spring of 1922 reveals him in just such a situati on. His quest for a permanent home led him to the Dalcroze Institute at Hellerau near Dresden, where the de Salzmanns had worked before the war. The choice of the lavishly equipped buildings of the Dalcroze Institute must have been prompted by the de Salzmann connection, but Hellerau would anyway have been an ideal site for attract ing attention to his ideas. The little town preserved some of the atmosphere of the days of hope before the war; but the prophet Dalcroze had departed, and the colony of Progressives was left without a leade r. Jaques-Dalcroze's system of \"Rhythmische Gymnas tik\"-ang licized \"Eu­ tythmics\"-is designed to develop a sense of rhythm in children by training t hem .to express a musical line with their limbs.

In this atmosphere Jeanne de Salzmann had worked as a rhythmician and Alexander de Salzmann achieved his extra ordinary lighting effects. But the dynamic quality of the prewar colony -it seems to have been scarcely less ecstatic than that other center of the Progre ssives on Monte Verita at Ascona -was not of this world . Upton Sinclair's World's End incorporates a telling parable of the Dalcroze Institute's isolation from everyday reality . On a plain below Hellerau, Sinclair writ es, was \"an exercise ground of the German arm y.\" The drilling and maneuvering which took place daily were ignored by the devotees of Dalcroze as irrelevant to the Utopia \"of cultivated and gracious aesthetes in which they were preparin g to pass their days .\" But field-gray and cannon triumphed over Greek tunics and the symphony orchestra. At the outbreak of war in August, the Hellerau Institute was turned into a hospital . Next month, Jaqu es-Da lcroze signed a petition organized by Geneva intellectuals against the German bombard­ ment of Rheims Cathedral . For his part, he decided not to return to Germany; and on thei rs, the German criti cs, who had once showered him with pra ises, became rather scathing about the work of a man they regarded as a turncoat. For some time the Dalcroze buildings lay derelict, until they were leased to three separate esta blishments: a less ambitious Dalcroze school , a German high school run by Karl Baer, and a school run on Progressive lines by A. S. Neill, the fo under of Sum merhill. The poet Edwin Muir arrived to teach there in Ma rch 1922, soon after Gurd jieff's appear ance. He fo und a climate of \"new ideas\" and an expectation of a \"new life\" which was to result from \"the simple exercise of freed om. \" Hellerau itself had turned from being a crafts man's Utopia into a refuge fo r what would now be called radical chic: \"govern ment officials fr om Dresden and faddists of all kinds had settled in the place .\" In the vacuum left by the absence of Dalcroze, all sorts of prophets made their appearance . Muir remembered how, sitting one evening in a gar den, \"I saw a tall handsome man in Bowing robes, a fillet round his head, passing ma jest ically with a beautiful subservient young woman on either side. I never saw him again, and hardly know whether he was a visiting prophet or an apparitio n.\""},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE TRAVELING CIRCUS 189 If Gurd jieff had succeeded in establishing himself at Hellerau, he might easily have swept the board of such trumpery magi and given a new conception of \"freedom\" and \"unfr eedom\" to the Progressive educators­ he would in fact have attacked the people who were to show most interest in his ideas from within one of their own most hallowed citad els. The coup was evidently worth taki ng trouble over. \"Finding this house and its installations more or less suitable fo r the fo unding and fu rther development of the headquarters of the Institute ,\" Gurd jieff wrote , \"I resolved to acquire the complete establish ment. \" What then took place has remained shrouded in Ouspensky's hints of \"strange events . .. which ended in legal proceed ing s.\" The sole traceable witness of the affair is the late A. S. Neill: There was a big Krach [row] but in German which I hardly knew then. Karl Baer and a fe w others and I made a Vertrag [agreement] with the owner of the Dalcroze Anstalt I think fo r five years occupat ion. Then G. came along and told the owner, Harold Dohrn, that he wanted the building. Dohrn agreed to give it to him in spite of our lease. We said we would fight it by law, and Harold then came round to our side. The story went that G. took him to law in Dresden and in court Dohrn said G. had hypnotised him, sayin g that his, G.' s work was of greater importance than ours. G. lost the case. The legal records are not availa ble, but the facts are not in dispute. Against a legally binding agree ment, Dohrn was persuaded to lease his property to Gu rdjieff, and when he came to himse lf, he claimed he had been hypnotiz ed. Dohrn might have been trying to find an excuse fo r �u ct which he had belatedly realized was indef ensible; but in view of Gurd jieff's known skill as a hypnotist, it seems likely that he was telling the truth . If so, this obliges us to look again at Gurd jieff's repeated declarations about the oath he had taken to refra in from using his hypnotic powers . Either he was lying when he described this oath to his pupils, or he was lying when he gave them to understand that he had kept it. In Glimpses of T ruth he is represented as warning his pupils to take nothing on trust; and it was an in junction which might usefully have been taken to heart by some of the Westerners who gravitated into his orbit. Gurd jieff's stay at Hellerau was not entirely without results. He fa iled to acquire his building, but he captured some of its inmates. Some of Dalcroze's best rhythmicians were still at Hellerau, and several , including Iessmin Howarth and Rosemary Lillard , were so impressed by Gurd jieff's .,glove ments that they abandoned Eur ythmics to fo llow the new Master. At Hellerau , there were few signs of the fa r-reach ing changes once dreamed of by Dalcroze--who had hoped to induce in each rhythmician a clear"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE perception of \"what he really is.\" Gurd jieff would have fo und it child's play to adapt the occult vision of self -mastery which had served in Russia to a less superstitious setting, and present his System as a method of attai ning the goals which Eur ythmics had failed to rea ch. Some hints of the magici an's aura, the habit of a master of novic es, increas ingly the subfusc of the psychologist -all these acc outrements belonged to the \"Gur dj ieff' who materialized in Eur ope in 1922. But his outer garments were those of the teacher of danci ng, and the succes sful conversion of the Dalcroze rhythmicians probably decided him on this disguise. The terms in which his tea ching was described in the prospectus fo r the Institute at Fontaine bleau-and the refore the way in which his English and American pupils first perceived the Ma ster-owed a lot to the brief adventure of Hellerau. The variety of Gurd jieff's changing fo rms and the subtle diff erences in the way his teach ing was presented leave the inquirer confused as to the consistency of his methods. The strange dynamic of the man never alters, but presents itself at diff erent periods as a mission to the occult ists, a· mission to the intellectuals-and now, at his entrance to Western Europe, as a mission to the Progre ssives, with Gurd jieff as a Meister des Urseins who will return humanity to the state of grace before the Fall. He is playing quite a number of roles at any one moment: the big role of the Teac her, the small immediate role which is designed to produce a particular effect on a particular pupil, and a generalized role to ensure a relatio nship of meaning with the whole milieu in which he chances to be operat ing. The conf using side effects of this method were not ignored by Gu rdjieff, who could make use of them to enhance his mystique. As he says at the end of the first chapter of Beelzebub's Toles, \"with a signature there must be no joking\" and so halts the pen about to set his name on paper. Then being \"very, very careful ,\" he writes not a name but a number of descript ions. He who in childhood was called \"Tatakh \"; in early youth \"Darky;\" later the \"Black Greek\"; in middle age , the \"Tiger of Turkestan \"; and now, not just anybody, but the genuine \"Monsieur\" or \"Mister\" Gu rdj ieff, or the nephew of \"Prince Mukransk y,\" or finally simply a \"Teacher of Danc ing. \" But despite the fluidity which his changes of role allowed him, Gurd jieff's progre ss through the world as a teacher accumulated fo rm. In Russia his role as magus had been conveniently broken by the Revoluti on, and it is Ouspensky's writings which have preserved a record of this act of the play .

Was Gurd jieff in fa ct trying to divest himself of the pupils who, as it were, had played a role in one production and would be mere extras or impossible to cast in the next? To Ouspensky the program of the Tiflis Inst itute had seemed to \"caricatu re\" Gurd jieff's work; but his understanding of that work had been influenced by his director's previous product ion. Although no doubt similar truths are hinted at in The Tempest and Peter Gynt, there are critics who respond more readily to Shakespeare than to Ibsen. No one will object if they announce this fa ct; only if they claim that Ibsen ought always to have written like Sha kespeare . On the other hand, a succ essful theatrical director can have his fa ilures, and may indeed lose his touch altoge ther. Hist orical circu mstances ensured that when Gurd jieff made his ap­ pearance in Western Eur ope, the earlier fo rms of his work still hung like a ghostly chrysalis about him. He had not succeeded in ridding himself of all his pupils and most probably only wished to dispense with the minor characte rs. Gur djieff's Method demands that the teacher have assistants; and most of his general staff had already collect ed. Dr. Stoerneval was still with him fr om the early days in St. Petersburg, the de Hartman ns from Ess entuki, the de Salzmanns from Tifl is. But there were others- less close to the Master and sometimes less capable of understanding his intentions­ who remembered the earlier stages of Gurd jieff's work with which they had been connect ed.

His search fo r a suitable framework fo r his activities had halted for the moment at the Tiflis conception of an \"Inst itute .\" Institutes-like that of Dalcroze-were very much the fa shion. Gurd jieff's Institute was at first taken at its fa ce value by his English converts-although it bore a puzzling complexi on. His public entry to Western Europe was as mysterious an affair as his arrival in Moscow, and the long period waiting in the wings in Germany was fo rgotte n. His past was as unknown to his English pupils as it had been to the Russians; the myth of Gurd jieff had not yet had time to grow, and the glyph was only just beginning to elaborate itself.

And what is the point of haVing the finest critical intelligence of the day if you devote it to exp ounding the cosmology of All and Everything?\" Such a verdict makes the mist ake of assuming that Orag e's inter est in the \"myst ical\" could be separated from his other conc erns. It was a mis take not made by those who knew him, even if, like Ezra Pound, they did not share his preoccupat ions. \"I had no interest in Orage 's mysticism and am unqualified to define it, \" he wrote in T. S. Eliot's Criterion after the death of Or age . \"I was thankf ul he had it simply because it kept him in action .... \" Alf red Richard Orage was born in 1873 in the YDrkshire village of Dacre near Bradf ord. He was the last of fo ur childr en, and his fath er died at the age of fo rty, only a year and a half after the boy was born. The family was left in difficult circ um stances, as William Orage had lost his farm in Cambridgeshire and gambled or drunk away his money before moving to Yorkshire to become a scho olmaster. The youngest son may have inherited from his fa ther some of the fa mous charm together with the fre eboo ting qualities observed by Shaw when he described Orage as a \"desperado of geni us.\" But the most obvious influence on Orage's character was the experience of his childhood poverty in the Cambridgeshire village of Fenstanton where the fa mily returned soon after the father's death . The Orages of Fenstanton liked to suppose themselves of Huguenot origin-although the name had been anglicized to rhyme with \"porridge .\" It was probably Bernard Shaw who started the more modish pronounciation with a French stress. Orage was later known even to close friends by his surname alone, and it became a sure passport to fa ilure if someone"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE MAESTRO OF THE MUSICAL GLASSES 197 presumed to call him \"Alf red. \" Even the \"Richard\" was an addition at his confirmati on, based on his schoolboy nickname of \"Di cky\" and replaci ng the original \"Alf red James .\" In this juggling with names and in his later love of anonymity -most of his contributi ons to the New Age were signed with diff erent sets of initials-may lie a clue to understanding the man. As his reaction to Ouspensky was to show, one of Orage's great fe ars in practicing the Gur dj ieff Me thod was that he might discover that everything he had assumed to be himself -the arti st, the editor -was not his real self at all. Not because he was ashamed of his early privat ions but because he had loathed them, the charismatic intellectual Orage-\"whose very name was the Storm ,\" as Chesterton wrote-s ubmerged the memory of Dicky Orag e, the poor scholar of Fenstant on. Howard Coote, the son of the local squire, marked the boy out as a pupil of promise in the class he taught at a Non-Conf ormist Sun day School. Coote allowed him the run of his library , introduced him to the works of Ruskin, Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, and Mo rris-who left their ponderous traces all over Orage's less acco mplished prose-and subsidized his education after the age of fo urt een. Under Coot e's supervision, Orage acquired French and Italian , both of which he read with fluency, although despite the long periods he spent in France, his spoken French never lost its execrable accent. The young man's zeal fo r self -improvement led him to study drawing and to trudge the ten miles into Cambridge to art college . In the village school at Fenstanton, he so outshone his fe llow pupils that a special prize was set aside fo r him to prevent his competitors fr om becoming demoral ized . Eventually he was appointed pupil-teacher, and the Coote family paid fo r his trai ning as a schoolmaster proper at Culham College near Qxford. In 1893 Orage left Fen stanton fo r a teac hing job in Leeds which the ' t:iOo tes had fo und fo r him. About this time he met his fu ture wif e, Jean Walke r, a student at the Royal College of Art. They were not to be married until 1896, and their friendship was sustained chiefly by corresponde nce. Accor ding to his :biogra pher, Philip Mairet, Orage 's decision to marry cost him the support '()f his patr on, who obj ected to the marriage as putting a stop to a promising car eer. But there were additional reasons fo r the quarre l. Coote himself had married and had a son, whom he proclaimed a fu ture Prime Mini ster of England. All Fenstanton knew that Orage's hopes were blighted; and later Orage himself used wrily to end the story with the reflecti on, \"Ce sont les premiers pas qui Coote .\" Orage had thus to abandon his hopes of a Cambridge educati on. He remained to the end of his days a don manque, and during the decline of the New English Weekly, he was debating with himself the possibility of getting"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE a job at Oxford or Cambridge . In the event, the intellectual world he entered was of a peculiar kind, and Orage became a f eading expo nent of its tradition of thought. The most superficial part of this world was its Socialis m. Orage became involved with openair political meetings in Leeds and worked fo r a time with the Independent Labo ur Party. He met Tom Mann and other Socia lists; Mairet dates Orage's real break from the lif e at Fenstanton from his arrival at his mother's fu neral wearing a tie of a revolutionary red. Orage's politics seem to have put him in disf avor with the educational authoriti es; but in the main he was interested in what his friend Holbrook Jackson called \"So cia lism, not Socialists ,\" and his Socialist phase repre­ sented the first stirrings of rebel lion, the emergence of the thinking man. It also coincided with his marriage to Jean Walker and his escape from the tutelage of Coote. In any case, as Orage himself wrote in 1926, \"So cial ism was not then either the popular or unpopular vogue it has since bec ome; but it was much more of a cult, with affiliations in directions now quite disowned -with theosophy , arts and crafts , vegetaria nism, the 'simple life,' and almost, as one might say , the mu sical glasses .\" On all these tympani Orage learned to play with scintillating effect. It was the age of Fabian ism, of anti-vivisecti on, of Rational Dress; of William Morris and crafts men's Utopias ; of Nietzsche and the Superman; above all, of the occult ists. In Eng land the Theosophical Society combined H. P. Blavatsky's occu ltism with the emphasis placed on social ref orm by her succ essor, Annie Besant. It was an atmosphere in which Ouspensky would have been perf ectly at home. The influence of this milieu remained surprisingly strong up to the 1930s and produced a sort of intell ectual­ D. H. Lawrence and Charles Williams are two other examples of the type-­ who remained isolated from the mainstream of thought in London or the universitie s. Orage was not the only thinker to have received his further education at Theosophical hands; what was remarkable was the speed with which he came to dominate his field of activity and the critical mind which ref used to become the slave of Tibetan Mahatm as. Orage had no particular religious upbringing. His mother was not religiOU S, and his attendance at the Non-Conf ormist Sunday School does not appear to have produced any extra ordinary piety. \"I remember, \" he wrote in 1907, \"years ago boo-ing through the keyhole of a Methodist meeting in which a Revivalist was singing, 'Where is my wandering boy tonight?' And 1 remember the Revivali st boupding to the door and shouting: 'Get away , you little fiend!

His first personal fo rum outside Theosophical lecture platf orms was a small \"Plato Group\" in Leeds which met weekly fo r several yea rs. From the point of view of some of his listeners, Orage might just as well have talked about gar dening, fo r in Holbrook Jackson's wor ds: \"The attraction was ultimately Orage , not Plato, or Nietzsche, or Blavatsky, or whatever it might be at a particular moment. He used philosophy as the jump ing-off place fo r the display of his own powers and personality .\" Orage's personal magne tism began to attract devot ees, and his long-boned, handsome physique did nothing to put them off. Holbrook Jackson remembers him as he was in 1901: In appearance Orage was tall and at that time slim and dar k-haired . He dressed conventionally, except fo r a soft fe lt hat, then unusual, and probably an indication of social and aesthetic revol t. He had an aura, and impressed so much by his presence that you fo rgot details, even the vague birthmark which broke into his complexion like an irregular sunburn, and seemed to become deeper when he was bored or out of humour .... You expected a man who looked like that to talk we ll. . . . Even his small talk was fa scinat ing. Jackson, who loathed the \"yoga-stricken mugwumps of Leeds ,\" was not the only person to comment on Orage's \"aura\"-and his eyes. The Nietzschean Anthony Ludovici, who first met Orage in London in the late 1900s, noticed bQth: I was struck then, as I never ceased to be struck every time I met Orage, by the intense intellectuality that radiated fr om every part of his being, particula rly, of cour se, his eyes. A curious disparity between the latte r, whether in their pigmentation or fo rm, only s erved to .e nhance the uncanny expr ession of resolute and penetrating wizardry which always suffused his fa ce when he was speaking, and many a def eated debater must have left the bewildering man's presence with an uncomf ortable fe eling of having been routed as much by what he had seen as by what he had heard . Orage's mental fireworks often had miraculous results.

An immediate friendship sprang up, and a week after their meeting, a torre nt of conversation was unleas hed, which culminated in Orage's exp ounding the Bhagavad Gita to Jac kson, and Jackson preac hing on texts from Nietzsche. Orage lent Jackson the Gita, and Jackson riposted with Thus Spake Zarathustra . \"Next morning, \" remembers Jackson, \"he walked from his cottage at Chapel Allerton to mine at Headingley with a new light in his eye. He had spent the night with 'Zarath ustr a,' and the time fo r action had come-and the Leeds Art Club was bor n.\" Nietzsche had supplied the keystone fo r Orage's first synthesis, and Orage \"went over the top.\" \"We all developed supermania.

The precise ingredients were a matter of dispute among the more Theosophically inclined Orage , the Fabian Jackson and a third collaborato r, A. J. Penty, an architect whose researches into the medieval guild system were to have significant political results. Later the Arts Club was stated to have \"no written object ,\" and at its fo undation in 1903 the terms were already beautifully loose. Its members were to \"affirm the mutual depen­ dence of Art and Ideas. The separation of beauty fro m use, or use from beauty, proves in the long run disastrous to both; and only their union in a single clear purpose can restore to us the value of either. To this end it is necessary that real and enduring standards should be created anew ... \" To begin their revolution in taste , the Club held exhibitions of arts and cra fts, provided a gathering place fo r kindred spirits and arranged open meetings in the Leeds Museum to which eminent figures- including Yeats, Chester­ ton and Sha w- were persuaded to come. The more intimate proceedings were dominated by Jackson and Orage , who shared, fo r example, a series of Friday evening lectures in April and May 1905, at which the topics were distributed as fo llows : \"Imaginary Portrait : The Superman as Saint\" Holbrook Jackson \"Sentimentalism, Romanticism and Rea lism\" Alfred Orage"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE MAESTRO OF THE MUSI CAL GLASSES 201 \"Art and Conduct\" Holbrook Jackson \"The Principles of the Arts Club\" Alfred Orage The Leeds Arts Club possessed a library largely assembled by Orage , and as its premises also housed the local Fabian Society and Theosophical Society, the collection reflected the whole scope of his intere sts. Members of one society were quite likely to belong to another or all three . Mary Gawsthorpe, a suffragette who was a member of the Arts Club and later contributed to the New Age, recalls in her autobiography , Up Hill to Holloway, how one afternoon in the clubro oms, as she cast about among the shelves, she stumbled unwittingly from social reform to Annie Besant on karma. Regard less of how famous they later became, Mary Gawsthorpe found the members of the Club \"as unique, as distinguished a group then, . then not later in their lives, as I have met anywhere since. Not easy mixers , not peppy, not pollyanas, not smart, not merely brainy, they had an unmist akable quality of being mature mentally, even then, over thirty years ago. It was stimulating, refreshing, and nourishing to be a member of the Leeds Art Club circa 1904. \" The music and drama critic Gerald Cumber­ land was another member of Orage 's audienc es. He was less certain of the quality of his compa nions, which was apt to fluctuate, particularly on the occas ions when Orage lectured \"rather dangerou sly\" on Nietzsc he: His gospel, always preached with his tongue in his cheek, that every man � woman should do precisely what he or she desires, acted like heady Win e on the gasping and enthusiastic young ladies who used to sit in rows worshipping him. They wanted to do all kinds of terrible things, and as Orage, backed by \"that great Germa n,\" Nietzsche, had sanctioned their most secret desires, they were resolved to begin at once their career of licence . They used to \"stay behind\" when the lectures were over, and question Orage with their eyes, and it used to be most amusing and a little pathetic to listen to the gay and half-hearted insults with which Orage at once thwarted and bewildered his silly devotee s. He had in those days a wonderful gift of talking a most divine nonsense -a spurious wisdom that ran closely along the border-line of rank absurdity. The \"cosmic conscio usness\" of Walt Whitman was a great theme of his, and Orage , in his subtle devilishly clever way, would lead his listeners on to the very threshold of occult knowledge and leave them there wide�tl¥ed and wonder-struck.

Nietzsche and the rebellion again st Victori anism had something to do with it, as did the Arts Club which became a center fo r what Philip Mairet calls \"not a little flouting of conventions and libertarian experime nt. \" But Orage himself was at least as much the cause as the atmosphere he had helped engender. \"He wasted his subst ance in talking and fal ling in lov e,\" wrote Holbrook Jackson. \"He allowed himself to fall in love too often in those early days both in Leeds and Lond on, and until he learnt how to canalise his passions his work suff ered.\" Later Orage was to list \"Falling in lov e,\" as his recreation in Who's Who , but appar ently even in Leeds he had recognized a \"scattering of fo rce\" which resulted fr om his fr equent affairs . Jackson recal ls a suggestive incident on the beach at Whitby, when unexpectedly he came upon Orage making a bonfire of poems and love letters. How seriously to take his Don Juanism is uncertain . Ma ry Gawsthorpe records a visit to the Orage's tiny house in the Potternewtons at Leeds. She was at that time engaged, and Orage knew her fiance as well as herself. This did not prevent him fr om suddenly drawing me to him as I prepared to go. Without any warning and before I knew it, he had pulled me to him and had said, \"Kiss me.\" I have heard the theory that \"there is no seduction\" discussed with wa rmth, but I shall stoutly declare howeve r, that if there is such a thing as the spirit of the thing that must have been a perfect exam ple, fo r I was led, and in spite of all laughs to the contrary, to do exactly what Orage asked, or commanded, that is, I kissed him. This innocent or unconscious resp onse, the reader making the choice, was acco mpanied by something so arresting I could not fa il to take note of it. Swift as lightning, the taker of the kiss gave a little laugh, an elated, triumphant laugh . It may be thought that this tells us more about the prim and prudish atmosphere of Leeds than about the motives which swayed Orage .

Any blame fo r the separation which eventually took place was by no means one-sided; but Jean Orage's increasing intimacy with Jackson was the immedi ate cause of husband and wif e going their diff erent ways. Apparently, despite a series of minor crises, the marriage did not break down until Orage finally settled in London. Leeds was proving too small a stage fo r the self -confidence Orage 's succ ess had given him. His teac hing had become irksome, his private life complicated. The Leeds Arts Club had been astonishingly succes sful and had spread from Leeds to Hull and Bradf ord, but its membership never exceeded 100, and this could not give Orage the audience he needed. At the end of 1905 he left Leeds fo r London, where he was joined by Jackson and Penty. For luggage he took only his three-volume translation of Nietzsche . The world he had left behind was the greate st influence on his thought until he met Ouspensky and Gu rdj ieff. Jean Orage remained within that world, reta ining Theosophical interests and working as an embroider ess fo r William Morris's firm of decorat ors. Orage himself never lost his deep concern with the occult, and in London as in Leeds, the groups of idealistic Progr essives clustered round the Theosophical Society and the fr inges of Fabian ism, giving him his first public. But in Nietzsche he had fo und both a personal just ification and a bridge between the restricted world of esotericism and matters of general intellectual conc ern. During the bleak depression of his first months in London, when he was fa iling to support himself by freelance writing and living on the charity of fr iends, Orage :wrote two small boo ks, Friedrich Nietzsche , the Dionysian Spirit of the Age (1906) and Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism, published the next year . In the first book, the author hailed Nietzsche as \"the greatest Eur opean event since Goethe\"; and his analysis of the salient points of \"the philosopher with the hammer\" proves how greatly this influence prepared him-as it did Ouspens ky-fo r certain aspects of Gurd jieff's ideas. Orage hailed the coming of the Superman. But what of the rabb le, the canaille, with their lack of taste and their gilded idols? \"The multitude with their gods are indispensable to the creation of the powerful man. As a sort of battlefield and place of exercise, the populace serve the needs of the aristocrat .\" Orage and Jackson began to agitate in the Fabian Arts Group, a body formed in 1907 by Fabians disenchanted with the ideas of Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Together with Penty they made overtures to the Junior Art Workers Guild, in which the architect was lecturing on the revival of the guild system. These societies provided Orage's earliest opportunities to shine. in the public eye, but at the same time his Theosophical activities made him a source of controversy in the esoteric world."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"204 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE By July 1905, Orage was a member of the committee of the British Section of the Theosophical Society, and on his arrival in London he resumed the Theosophical lectures which had been so succes sful in the north. Soon his unorthodox brand of Theosophy began to attract critic ism. It was not only its Nietzschean iconoclasm which shocked the Theosophists, but its irrever ent trea tment of the tin god s, Blavatsky and Besan t. Orage made his debut in London Theosophical circles at a time when these were considerably agita ted. In 1906 a celebrated row broke out over the immoralities of Mrs. Besant's fr iend, C. W. Leadbeate r; the fo llowing year , those who attacked Mrs. Besant fo r her support of Leadbeater fo und more ammunition in questionable goings-on at the deathbed of the President of the Society, Colonel Olcott . The Himalayan Masters who were supposed to be the powers behind the scenes were said to have appeared and appointed Mrs. Besant as his successor; there were , how ever, rival claimants, and skirmishing resulted in permanent divisions within the Theosophical Society, as well as the secession of several independent gro ups. Natura lly, Orage ranged himself with the critics of the estab lishment. The first of a series of articl es he published in the Theosophical Review between the end of 1905 and the end of 1907 was an attack on the Society which was giving him column space fo r not living up to its princi ples. The last word had not been said on Theosophical matters, he reminded the more cultist of his rea ders. \"Once one took the literature of the Society as the revelation of exact knowledge . Now one sees the literature as the fo rerunner of a still more splendid revelation of worlds unimagined before .\" As fo r The Secret Doctrine, \"what in the name of Oeaohoo the Younger, does it an mean?\" Was one Th eosophist like any other, and was there rea l l y a \"Theosophical\" point of view? \"Do ubtles s,\" he taunted, \"with many others in the Society, I am not religi ous, I am not psychic, I am not SCientific .

Ten years bef ore, he wrote , such a title would have made his mouth wa ter. \"I see myself in those remote days impatiently cutting the pa ges, and turning the lea ves to find the article itself.

Its historian Wallace Martin refers to \"its unprecedented fo rm.\" The distinguished contributors and the various causes fo r which Orage made propaganda are fairly well known, but the original purpose of the paper has been buried by Orag e's later enthusia sms. In the first number of the New Age, the editors printed as their creed a hymn to the Life Force: Believing that the darling object and purpose of the universal will of life is the creation of a race of supremely and progre ssively intelligent beings , the NEW AGE will devote itself to the serious endeavour to co­ operate with the purposes of life and to enlist in that noble service the help of serious students of the new contemplative and imaginative order. It was the fe eling which Ouspensky experienced half a dozen years later. A new race of men was on the earth-and there was no limit to their potentialitie s. In some ways the New Age was the Leeds Arts Club writ large, and its stated objects bear a distinct relation to the ideas of raising human faculties to another dimension which Orage was elaborating in the Theosophical press. Soon after Orage had moved into his half of the editorial chair, the Theosophical Publishing Society issued his Consciousness, Animal, Human and Superhuman which states positively the Nietzschean occultism at which he had been hinting in his Theosophical article s. The book consists of lectures which Orage originally delivered to Theosophists in Manchester and Leeds , and the man who wrote it had little ' to learn from the basic argum ent of Tertium Organum . In many ways his analogies are more acceptable than those of Ouspensky. Orage begins by assuming \"a perfectly contin uous and essentially similar underlying consciou sness common to all living things visible and invisible .\" This \"universal awar eness ... only by the particularised activities of beings becomes defined and limited into specifically human, animal, vegetable modes .\" Animal conscio usness is a \"one plane conscio usne ss,\" receptive like a sheet of sensitive paper; but there is no knower of the impressions received. \"In fact ,\" states Orage , \"there may be memory without a memor iser.\" Human conscious ness can be represented by the sensitive paper fo lded once, so that the second plane surface fo rmed stands fo r an observer of the impressions received by simple, \"One plane consciousne ss.\" We decline into animal conscio usness, warns Orage, in striking anticipation of Gurd jieff's terminology, \"when we are not observing ourselves .\" The upper limit of human conscio usness is illust rated by fo lding the paper into a sphere , symbolizing the vigilance of the ego. It is important to Orage to"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE MAESTRO OF THE MUSI CAL GLASSES 207 stress that the human mode of consc iousness had been fo rmed out of the original animal consc iousness \"like the embr yo within the shell ,\" because his real purpose is to predict the emergence of a Superman whose consciousness \"should compare with man as man compares with the anima l.\" Using his analogy of the fo lded pa per, Orage asks his readers to imagine a third fo ld to represent Superman consci ousness. If the ego creates a human mode of consciou sness by observing pure animal sensitivity to impressions, a still higher mode might be attained by contacti ng the higher self which can observe the ego. This is the directing overmind responsible fo r creative though t, and the birth of this new observer takes place in the womb of human consciousness just as human consciou sness develops fr om the animal : an emer gence represented in mystical doctrines as a rebirth or an . aw akening fr om sleep. Just as the \"interiorizing\" of man has resulted in the growth of mental fa cu lties, Orage prophesies that the emergence of Superman conscio usness will be accompanied by the growth of new \"ecstatic fac ultie s.\" He stops short of laying down the law on how this growth is to be ac hieved: to seek to grow in this way is dangerous and the choice of means must be an individual responsibility. The tone of the book is that of a man nursing a general hope fo r the promised land, but disillusioned with his own attempts to reach it. \"Perhaps the sure way is to i-aise, to deepen, and to extend our human fac ulti es ,\" Orage conclude s. He set about contributing to this aim in the columns of the New Age . He and Jackson bought the New Age-th en an old established weekly in severe financial difficultie s-wi th the aid of a subsidy of 500 pounds fr om i � o/g e Bernard Shaw and a similar sum fr om a Theosophical fri end of � called Lewis Walla ce. Wallace had made money sheepfarming in New Zealand and, acco rding to the translator Paul Selver, \"had white silky hair, a drooping moustache to match , a rosy fa ce and a general air of self ­ depreciation no matter whom he was talking to .\" He wrote fre quent articles ofan occult cast fo r the New Age under the pseudonym of \"M. B. Oxon\"­ lin allusion to the pen name, \"M. A. Oxon ,\" of the fa mous Victorian spirit med ium, the Reverend W. Stainton Moses. For several years he contrib­ uted 100 pounds a month to shore up the rickety finances of the magazi ne. The pool of talent from which the new editors drew was that centered on ' the Fabian Arts Group and its allied lobbie s. G. K. and Cecil Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Bernard Shaw, and H. G. Wells were among the earliest recr uits; and their tussles in print established one thing important to the characte r of the paper-it was not tied to any sectional interest. Soon it .became clear that the only fixed star in the New Age galaxy was Orage himself. In January 1906, he became sole editor when Holbrook Jackson"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"208 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE bowed out of an undertaking which his colleague insisted on keeping independent -and, of cour se, Orage an-at the expense of financial sta­ bility. The \"desperado of genius\" had arri ved. Orage now entered on the days of his gre atness which lasted until the middle of the First World War . His long apprenticeship in the provinces--.­ he was thirty-three when he arrived in London-had developed in him the qualities which he now deployed so skillful ly. As editor, he was naturally a fo cus of intellectual activity, but the groups which fo rmed around him at this time greatly extended the editorial fu nction . In the words of Prof essor Janko Lavr in: \"One could not find so high a level of conversation anywhere in Lond on. \" On Monday afternoons the circle would gath er in the basement of the Chancery Lane ABC cafe , where the pro ofs of the next issue were read and the talk ranged fa r and wide. Once a week Orage would leave his tiny office and become the center of discussions at the Kardomah caf e in Fleet Street. Those who met in print in the New Age met in person in the editor's company. In the early days, the group would include Cl iff ord Sharp, S. G. Hobson, the Chestert ons, sometimes Wells and Arnold Bennett; later perha ps, J. C. Squire, Katherine Mansfield, F. S. Flint, T. E. Hulme, and the Imagist poets were include d. Orage's love of debate encouraged him to stir up disagr eement both in verbal discussion and in print. The only cloud on the horizon was his occasional prick liness when he fe lt his dignity threate ned. It was the same Ac hilles' heel that Jackson had noticed in Leeds. Under Orage's succes sful exterior was a latent insecurity which craved the applause of others; and when the trappings of succes� were denied him, this self -doubt came to dominate him entirely. The cau ses fo r which the New Age is chiefly remembered bear witness to his succe ss. There were, of course , the literary or aesthetic discussions--on \"the new drama\" or the realistic novel-and individual publicatio ns, like Arnold Bennett's \"Books and Persons\" column or the stories of Katherine Mansfield, which were ach ievements in gat hering copy rather than intellectual midwif ery. But the National Guilds movement, which owed its origin to the ideas of A. J. Penty and S. G. Hobson, and the later doctrine of Social Credit, the brainchild of Major C. H. Douglas , received a great part of their impulsion fr om Orage's magpie bra in. He was never an original thinke r, and even the Swiftean prose style on which he so prided himself sometimes makes heavy rea ding. Orage was preeminently a man of the moment, whose chief fa cility was to be there, a snapper-up of unconsidered inspirati ons. Under his mana gement, the New Age and its circle became the most articulate section of Progressive idealism in Brita in. The always Platonic idealism of Orage must be stressed, because it can easily be lost sight of under theories of the Guild State or a National Divide nd. Ezra Pound compared him fa vorably with other literary fig-"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE MAESTRO OF THE MUSICAL GLASSES 209 ures-Ye ats, Wyndham Le wis, and T. S. Eliot. They, said Pound, had \"no bottom .\" \"Orage ha d.\" A. E., who met him only in the last years of his lif e, recogn ized the voice of a fe llow idealist even in Orage's prewar political \"Notes of the Week .\" Orage began with a self -dedication to \"the universal will of lif e,\" and although he may seem in retrospect to have been absorbed in the artistic and political questions of the day , the cau ses he adopted all took as their basis the idea of changing the nature of man in society , rather than accepting man as fa llen and changing society to fit his unworthy needs. In the Theosophical articles of 1907, he had proclaimed his disillusion­ ment with the traditional occult arts and took refuge in Nietzsche. But by 1917 the Nietzscheanism of his New Age articles had fa ltered , and occult ism began to creep back into the paper in the company of psychoanaly sis. Orage 's earlier change of attitude had reflected less a change of direction than a new personal influence, and his return fr om the realms of general ideals to those more specifically esoteric coincided with the removal of that influence fr om his lif e. This influence was Beatrice Hastings, one of the principal contributors to the New Age fr om 1908 till 1914. Born Emily Alice Haigh in 1879, the girl who pref erred to be called \"Beatrice\" had led an even tful early lif e. Philip Mairet writes of the time when she met Orage, that she was \"dark, brown­ eyed and viva cious, with a manner revealing intensity both mental and emotional .\" A South Af rican, she had been married unsuccessfully to a prof essional boxer, and first met Orage at a Theosophical lecture he gave in London in 1906. She had been one of the young ladies who \"st ayed behi nd,\" and her appearance in Orage's lif e coincides with the irretrievable breakdown of his first marriage . Beatrice Hastings possessed considerable literary talent in addition to her physical attract ions. Her contributions to the New Age are prodigious in volume, although erratic in quality. Her specialty was malevolent criticis m, and she exercised her abilities to such effect that several London publishers stopped sending the paper books fo r review. She became not only Orage 's constant companion , but his literary conscience ; and her flamboyant presence was a necessary part of the setting at the New Age offices or the cafe gath erings. After Orage's death , she published a splenetic pamphlet whose bitterne ss and extravagance have been made the excuse fo r ignoring it altoge ther. She cla imed, fo r example, to have been responsible fo r most of the actual editing of the New Age until she left Orage, and this has naturally aroused the ire of latter-day Oragean s. But even the devoted Philip Mairet admits that she had a large hand in Orage's literary decisions, and it is obvious that t he quality of the editing did improve markedly as soon as she arri ved. The days of Beatrice Hastings were the days of Orage's greate st succ ess. There is some element of coincidence in this, and while"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"210 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE several of her later allegations are preposterou s, her portrait of Orage is so true to indications fr om other sourc es, as to repay the most careful study. It says much fo r the temper of the times that the presence of Beatrice Hastings at a Theosophical gathering did not mean that this fo rmidable young woman approved of the occ ult. Later she was to accuse Orage of \"paranoiac mystagoguery ,\" while at the same time herself writing a def ense of Mme. Blavats ky. But it seems that Orage's deep occult interests had early on given her quite a jolt. About a year af ter their meeting, she writes, \"when Aphrodite had amused herself at our expense, I fo und in his rooms a collection of works on sorcery . Up to this time, Orage's intimate friend was not Mr. Holbrook Jac kson, who thought he was , but Mr. Aleister Crowley .... Well, I consigned all the books and 'E quinoxes' and sorcery designs to the dustbin. But the aff air gave me such a shock that, fo r years, I would not hear of theosophy, spiritualism or anything to do with the occ ult. During my period on the New Age, fe w ref erenc es, even, will be fo und to such things unless on a tone of superb, and I add superbly ignorant cont empt.\" Orage did know Aleister Crowley; and he told C. S. Nott that he had met him while Acting Secretary of the Society fo r Psychical Research, a post he had filled on first coming to Lond on. Psychical research was an old interest of Orage, who had published on the subject in his Leeds days and edited a rather critical examination of Frederic M yer' s Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death in 1904. Edwin Mu ir, who as \"E dward Moore\" contributed to the New Age, claims that Orage \"was a member of a magic circle which included Yeats .\" By this he means the famous Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn which had split up into various quarre ling fa ctions in the year 1900, with Yeats and Crowley on opposite sides of the fe nce. The Golden Dawn had a temple at Bradf ord, and although there is no record of Orage's name in the membership lists of that organizatio n, the leading Theosophical lecturer in the north could hardly have avoided coming into contact with some of its members. Yeats had been one of the literary lions to appear bef ore the Leeds Arts Club; and his companion had been another member of the Golden Dawn , the act ress Florence Farr, who added a lute acc ompaniment to the poet's recitatio n. Until the advent of Beatrice Hastings, Florence Farr was the �hief woman contributor to the New Age. In June 1907, she had reviewed Orage's own Consciousness with the remark that \"Mr. Orage's mind is equipped by nature and subtle Eastern practices to give a better idea of Superman Consciousness than Shaw or Nietzsche .\" This confirms Beatrice Hastings's stat ement that in, Leeds Orage had taken to Hatha yoga and breathing exerci ses.

F. C. Fuller. The reviewer was concern ed chiefly with Crowley, not his disciple, and made fre quent references to chapter and verse which revealed him to be in possession of a set of Crowley's Equinox. Despite a half -hearted atte mpt to make Crowley appear a silly season fr olic, the reviewer conceded-in markedly Oragean cadences-that he dealt \"admirably\" with the proble ms of superconscio us­ ness. And some six months late r, at the end of February 1908, David Eder contributed an obscure but apparently fa vorable review of Crowle y's Konx Om Pax. This is the last that the readers of the New Age heard of Crowl ey, and it may be presumed to coincide with the purge of Orage's magical texts carried out by Beatrice Hastings. It is not going too fa r to see Orage's condemnation of the occult arts as the beginning of her influence over him, and in the silence thereafter observed by the New Age on occult top ics, her hand firmly on the reins. Crowley's \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the laws \" came very close to Orage's own Nietzschean morality; but judging by the tones in which Orage ref erred to the Great Beast when talking to C. S. Nott, he had never been in any danger of fal ling under the spell of the man. The arrival of Beatrice Hastings and the downf all of magic coincided with Holbrook Jac kson's departure . The New Age gradually changed its character from a Nietzschean-Fabian magazine to a literary and aesthetic review. Its triumphs were now of a diff erent sort. In the period up till the outbreak of .• � war, the New Age dealt most notably with aesthetic probl ems, and disting uished itself by discovering talented young writers . Orage began to emerge as a literary critic; and the successes of this era include the discovery of Kathe rine Mansfield and the elaboration of a \"conservative philosophy of culture\" by Orage, T. E. Hulme, and the Spanish educa­ ponalist Ramiro de Maeztu. Orage is not diminished by insisting on the influence exercised over him by Beatrice Hastings. It was usually a personal encounter which excited him to a new phase of activity. Her beauty, verve, and fu ndamental amorality gave Mrs. Hastings advantages which she did not hes itate to exploit, and it is quite possible that Orage , who usually succeeded in dominating his surroundings, was intrigued by encountering an equally s tro ng personality. Even at their first meeting, Beatrice Hastings claimed to have \"ra llied him, on his perverse loquacit y. \" Under her tutelage Orage was very much the man of lett ers, his Nietzscheanism in abeyance, his occ ultism damped down ."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 THE HA RMONIOUS CIRCLE Her departure from his lif e removed the inhibitions on his fundamental pre occ upati ons. It also coincided with a series of cri ses in the li fe of the New Age. As a result of this combination of fa cto rs, Orage was ready fo r another cr ossing of the Rubicon when Ouspensky arrived in Lond on. This time he was to drag a whole flotilla of souls after him."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"2 Suspensk When Orage and Jackson took over the New Age, they could count on a virtual monopoly of Progre ssive writers . The success of the magazine bred imitati ons: in 1911, Hilair e Belloc fo unded his paper, The Eye-Witness, and next year the Chesterton brothers left the New Age to join him. In 1913 Fabian pr essure launched the New States man, with two New Age men at the helm: J,C . Squire as literary editor and Cl iff ord Sharp as political editor. These defections deprived Orage of some of his best writers and established substantial competition to the New Age . The circulation dropped to less than 5,000. Nothing daunt ed, Orage increased the size of tlie paper and continued to encourage new writers . But at the end of 1913, the regular subsidy paid by Lewis Wallace ceased, and during the war printing costs rose to a level which the New Age could ill aff ord. This alteration in his materia l fo rtunes ran parallel with changes in Orag e's private ·Iif e. If we are to believe Beatrice Hastings, Orage was suff ering just before the war from a fo rm of nervous prostra tion, which he attempted to conceal by pas sing it off as \"overwork .\" He had \"periodic fits of a curious mental illne ss.\" Philip Mairet suggests that a sense of dissatisf action was germinating in Orag -e; that his worldly succe ss came increasingly into conflict with his deeper inclinati ons. \"Tales fo r Men Only,\" of which Orage wrote and 213"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE published at least six in the short period 1911-12, arise directly out of his inner conflict: his sense that he had allowed a stern dedication to the purposes of Art and the Lif e Force to be diverted into the channels of literary fam e. The plots of the \"Tales fo r Men Only\" concern the eff orts of the narrator-O rage's fav orite pseudonym R. H. Congreve (later abbreviated to R. H. c. )-to break up various love aff airs which threaten to absorb his friends. By the time of the sixth tale, published in November 1912, the tone is vitriolic, and the writer seems to be trying to fr ee himself altogether from the need fo r fe male compan ionship. Long after the liability to complete sub jection to fe male illusion is over, men sometimes continue to experience perturbations of their equilibrium in the presence of women. In fe w instances are these perturbations violent enough to overthrow the mind entirely, but fo r the moment they undoubtedly do cause the judgement to reel and stagger and the resulting conversation and acti ons to become distorted. These residual phenomena, howev er, are to be distinguished fr om the similar phenomena of ad olescence by the fa ct that they no longer inspire hope but disgust or, at least, annoyance . Beatrice Hastings was not the type to take even an implied attack lying down . A satirical sketch which she published in late 1913 under the pseudonym \"Robert a Fiel d,\" is apparently a reply to the \"Tales fo r Men Onl y.\" Although she ref ers to the piece under the title of \"The Non­ Comm ittal Ma n,\" it is obViously the one printed as \"Courtley Poole \"-a character presented as \"a fa natical bigot\" with \"a se lf-op inionated name .\" He is hypochondriac, neurotic, and stubborn . And there is one pertin ent criticism of a failing which Orage himself may have fe lt keenly . This might be expressed as a \"lack of fo llow-throug h.\" In a la wsuit, he refuses to appeal; when he takes lottery tic kets, it is only a single one. \"Ever ything which Courtley does turns out to h e moonsh ine. Mo onshine is the reward of all bigo ts .\" Finally , \"In May, 1914, domestic aff airs having become intoler a ble,\" writes Beatrice Hastings , \"I left fo r a fe w months' tour in order to make a brea k. \" At the outbreak of war she was living in Paris and remained as \"war corres pondent\" fo r the New Age. But the break was not clean ; bickering continued in a series of acri monious lett ers. The collapse of the relationship in 1916 was a blow to Orage's pride . Despite the vehemence of \"Ta les fo r Men Onl y,\" it seems that it was Beatrice Hastings who left him.

In this period of crisis he began to fr equent the Caf e Royal where , as G.K . Chesterton wrote , \"he presided in a sort of club. \" Augustus John, Walter Sickert, Jacob Epstein, and Orage's close friend, the Australian carica turist Will Dyson, were members of this circle . It was more worldly Bohemianism than Orage had previously known , and the companionship of the Caf e Royal may have solaced a lif e which had grown lonely. His emotions seem to have been fu rther confused by the attentions of a girl who refused to surrender to the fa mous charm , but pref erred, in the words of Philip Mairet, \"a Platonic attac hmen t. \" The fa ilure of the New Age to attract more new writers must also have contributed to lowering his se lf­ confidence, and the political schemes in which he became involved brought him equally little succe ss. After Orage became converted to the Social Credit theories of Ma jor C.H. Douglas, which fa iled to gain acceptance fr om the Labour Party or the National Guilds League , the New Age pounded out the message of Social Credit to a largely deaf nation, and the disillusionment of its editor grew. Much earlier, he wrote in 1926, he had begun to doubt whether any movement of ideas was possible among the proletariat; now he became convinced that if Douglas, \"the Einstein of economi cs, \" could be rej ected, \"ref orm in any drastic sense is impossible .\" Orage emerged fr om the war years fa cing fr ustration, insecurity, and a sense of fai lure. \"He became unable to miss a shot at golf, \" writes Philip Mairet, \"without glancing round anxiou sly in fe ar that some stranger had noticed the mistak e.\" In 1919 physical troubles were added to others when he had to undergo an operation fo r appendicit is. His mind began to return tQ the more metaphysical preoccupa tions which the presence of Beatrice �gs had fo r a time suppressed. This reviving interest in psychology and the occult made Ouspensky's teac hing instantly appea ling, because it �med to answer the questions which he and his friends had been so anxiously asking: in eff ect, the same questions he had shelved as insoluble � e fifteen years bef ore. ': The New Age published Ouspensky's \"Letters fr om Russia,\" and Orage him self turned violently aga inst Bolshevism, as a succession of Slav mystics, � ng their exotic gospels out of a Europe torn by war and revolution , � gan to appear in the New Age circ le. Janko Lavrin discovered Nicolai Ye limirovic, Bishop of Zica in Serbia, who contributed a series of l1PocaI yptic meditations to the New Age under his own name and the jSeudonym R.A. Vran-Ga vran . As early as 1915, Paul Selver had intro­ � d Orage to Dm itrij e Mitrinovic, at that time an attache at the Serbian � Itlbassy. Mitrinovic subscribed to a composite occu ltism based on the � ion of a united Chrisijan Europe; he occu pied himself in London by � ng to persuade people in positions of some influence to join him in an �'open conspiracy\" fo r the salvation of \"Pan-humanity. \" On August 19, 1920,"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"216 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Orage began a series of articles on \"World Aff airs \"'i n collaboration with Mitrinovic, under the pen name \"M. M. Cosmo i.\" For a time his disciplined hand held Mi trinovi C's near incomprehensible rhapsodies in check; but in December, Orage unleashed the prophet who rampaged through the columns of the New Age, mystifying its readers and wreaking havoc with the already tiny circulat ion. Mitrinovic's articles considered the various nations of humanity as diff erent organs of one great World-body; thus Germany might repr esent the scientific intelligence, Russia the intuition of mankind, and Britain-which Mi trinovic always called \"AI­ bion\" -the function of common sense. Few contrived to make sense of his ecstatic pare ntheses, and fe wer still can have come away fe eling greatly enlightened about world aff airs . Another innovation in the New Age was an extended discussion of psychoana lysis, and this inquiry repre sented the true continuation of Orage 's search fo r meaning. Psychoanaly sis was still an unfamiliar subject in England, although the days of its complete disregard were over. There had been a time when mention of Freud's name was enough to incur censure . In 191 1, when Dr. David Eder had read a paper on Freud's methods to a section of the British Me dical Associatio n, his chairman and the entire audience walked out in disgust. By contrast, Eder's own circle saw psychoana lysis as the harbinger of a golden age . The group which responded enthusiastically to Freud was the same section of the intelligentsia which a dozen years earlier had combined social , reform with Theosophy and the occu lt. Orage was not the only thinker to tire of the gla mor and frau dulence of the \"occult arts\" and yearn fo r a secular occ ultism which could explain man, his soul, and the universe in terms which did not revolt the rational mind. He had no difficulty in fo rming a group with the aim of construct ing a \"psycho-synth esis\": a solid edifice to oppose the psychic rubble generated by the analys ts' quarr ying. But on closer acquaintance it began to appear that psychoanalysis as it stood was not going to provide the liberating impulse fo r which the Progressives were lookin g. One of the gro up, Rowland Kenney, has recorded the disapp ointment of its members when they concluded that psychoanaly sis contained no \"possibilities fo r the building up of a new way of lif e\"; Perhaps because we had not grasped its deeper significance , it seemed to us that, while it might heal many psychic wounds, it would never help one to re-create one's own inner being. (It should be remembered that I am writing of the autumn of 19 21.) What we wanted, we decided, was a psychosynthesist -probably what we wanted was a chan ge, a new interest or excitement -and we tried to fo rmulate a kind"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"SUSPENSK 217 of programme or scheme for the building up of the psyche on new lines. The psychosynt hesis group included Havelock Ellis, David Eder, James Young, and Maurice Nicoll. Mitrinovic sometimes attended, and other members of the New Age circle like Kenney and Dr. J. A. M. Alcock were also involv ed. Ellis, Eder, and Orage had all been Fabia ns; of the younger generation, both Maurice Nicoll and James Young had studied with Jung at Zurich . Alcock, in Kenney's words, was \"a young medical man ... who had never been able to take materia medica seriou sly. He believed that in an enormous nu�ber of cases the value of a bottle of medicine depended on the faith the patient had in it.\" Rowland Kenney himself had been the first editor of The Daily Herald and was a long-standing member of the group around Orage . An air crash had left him broken in spirit as well as in body, and he hoped to find in psychoanalysis some solution to his personal probl ems. The sort of psychoana lysis which the New Age favored was never very far from the occult. Maurice Nicoll had connections with Theosophy as well as strong links with Jung. Young hoped that occult ism, understood as \"self­ development through deepening, or expanding the limits of self-con­ sciousness,\" might merge with the new psychology. David Eder's Freudi­ anism had anchored in a spirit which could also-as his review in the New Age of 1908 shows-play host to Aleister Crowl ey. Alcock had been born in India, and in Kenney's words, \"was delighted to find that psychoana lysis linked up with yoga and other Eastern philosophie s.\" Orage himself was reviving old contacts. Shortly after he had abandoned :'i'heo sophy to concentrate on the New Age, the Theosophical Society had fragmented. In 1909, G. R. S. Mead, who had published Orage's final articles in the Theos ophical Review, resigned to found his own Quest Society. This issued a magazi ne, The Quest, devoted to occultism, Theosophy, and scholarly work on the history of religion s; Ezra Pound, john Masefie ld, and Professor Wilson Knight were among the contributo rs. It was to Mead that Orage naturally turned when he again became ooncerned with questions of the spirit. \"What the circulation of The Quest is, I have no idea,\" he wrote in the New Age, \"but it should be ten times greater .\" The psychosynthesis group and the Quest Society exchanged views : Alcock contributed to The Quest, while Mead himself became interested in psychoanaly sis and wrote articles based on books lent him by David Eder. Two articles on yoga and psychoanal ysis published under the name of \"F. I. Winter\" may possibly have been by Orage himse lf. \"The Que st,\" announced Orage, \"is the literary Platonic Academy of our day.\""},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"218 THE HARMONI OUS CIRCL E During this period of undirected speculation Lewis Wallace returned to the New Age. As \"M.B . Oxon ,\" he published two articles in February 1920, at the height of discussion about psychosynt hesis. These were eccentrically entitled \"Psycho-E gyptology ,\" and their train of thought was soon to be incorporated in Wallace's extraordinary book, Cosmic Anatomy . His ideas would have been quite fa miliar to Gurdjieff, fo r example, he saw man as \"a com mon chord\" in touch with an upper and a lower worl d: \"The fact that he is man depends on the power he has to link these two octaves.\" When Ouspensky arrived in London, he fo und the intellectual world which centered on Orage in a state of fe rment and the focus of attention unst eadily shifting between psychoana lysis and mystical philosophy . Circum stances could have provided no material more aptly molded to his hand. The impasse in which the Orage circle fo und itself was a particularly intense fo rm of a condition which was affecting most thinking men and wom en. The Great War, that crowning futility, had just ended, and intellectuals everywhere were fe eling their way in a vacu um. In his essay \"The Republic of the Spir it,\" published in 1920 in The Evolution of an Intellect ual, John Midd leton Murry gave expre ssion to a whole army of opinion which saw the war as an object lesson in the fo llies of materia lism. This section of the com munity fe lt, but was not able to articulate , the fo ur years of horror, fe lt . it as a sin, experienced the shame of being less than human. \"We are somehow maimed ,\" wrote Mur ry, \"yet how we do not know.\" He appealed fo r a new \"aristocracy of the spirit\" disregarding worldly rewa rds. These it must \"replace by titles more ardu ous.\" The declaration of principle seemed absolute : \"In order that it may have the strength to refuse to compr omise without, it must refuse to compromise within .\" Among the Orage ans, the late summer of 1921 was a bleak season . On September 22, Orage warned that the New Age could only just cover its costs and was in danger of having to suspend publicati on. On October 13, the last of Mitrinovic's articles appeare d. The psycho synthe sis group was already in difficultie s. In early August, Maurice Nicoll had written in his diary a \"Prayer to Hermes\": \"Teach me-instruct me-shew me the Path so that I may know certainly-help my great ignora nce, illumine my darkne ss? I have asked a question .\" As if in answer to that question, Ouspensky made his entrance. In June, Claude Bragdon had made contact with him in Constantino ple. By July, Theosophical circles had some advance notice of his coming through an article on the fo urth dimension by Mead in The Quest, perhaps stimulated by Lady Rothermere who at this time was scattering about copies of Tertium Organ um. Ouspensky arrived in August 1921, and stayed at a Bloomsbury hotel. Almost immediately he began holding meetings to"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"SUSPENSK 219 expound the ideas of Gurdjieff. Orage was the chief mover in securing him . an audience, and Ouspensky's other Theosophical contacts proved useful. He spoke to Mead's Quest Society and to another breakaway group of Theosophists led by D. N. Dunlop---an early friend of Yeats and A. E. The psychosynthesis group pricked up its ears. J.A . M. Alcock wrote to Rowland Kenny to tell him that the psychosynthe sist had arriv ed. Orage went one better and sent a telegram sum moning Kenney to his Hat to meet Ouspensky. It became obvious that whatever Ouspensky was about, he was extremely sure of hims elf. He spoke not as a man inviting discussion, but as a Man Who Knows. Kenney's first meeting with Ouspensky left him \"puzzled\" but intrigued : His looks did not impress me. Neverth eless, when he smiled his eyes lit up with a warm twinkle which encouraged confidence and confidenc es . His nose made one think of a bird's strong beak ; indeed, when Sitting in reHection or repose he hunched himself together and looked like a dej ected bird huddling up in a rainstorm . He was obviously a man of a dominant if not domineering type of character, with determination-or obsti nacy- written over his every fe ature . I launched out with my views on certain recent develo pments in psycho-analy sis and a need fo r a revaluation of certain psychological princip les. Orage fo llowed on until he was brought to a dead stop by a snort from Ouspensky. \"Why waste time, Orage ? Tell Kenney what we are meeting fo r.\" The meeting was to establish a group to be taught, not a fo rum fo r discussion ; and to the collection of dedicated talkers gathered round Orage , this dictatorial attitude was hard to swallow. Paul Selver fo und Ouspensky \"quite monume ntally boor ish. He was one of those exasperating Russians who doggedly refuse to credit any other Slav nation with artistic ability . He sneered when I expressed the view that there were several Czech or Serbian poets of outstanding grea tness.

In his last five years , he had learned much about \"wiseacreing\" and was eVidently in no mood to tolerate it. From the beginning of November 1921, Ouspensky began to hold meetings of his own, at first in a studio owned by Lady Rothermere in Circus Road, St. John's Wood . The initial audience numbered about twenty"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"220 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE and consisted chiefly of readers or contributors to the New Age . After a time Lady Roth ermere tired of her new interest, but not before she had established Ouspensky in a small flat in Gwendwr Road in Baron's Court. The meeting place oscillated between the rooms of the Quest Society, and the house shared by Maurice Nic'oll and James Young at 146 Harley Street; then eventually, it became settled at 38 Warwick Gardens in South Kensingt on. And with Lady Rothermere's depart ure, the salon atmosphere created by her patronage vanished. Gradually, Ouspensky's reputation spread. The October number of The Quest carried a long review by Mead of Claude Bragdon's edition of Tertium Organum, still the only available translatio n.

Neither was he, explained Ouspensky, the eminent prof essor of mathematics to whom his translators had ascribed the book. His small audience grew slowly : the socia lites and the merely inquisitive departed, and those who had heard of Ouspensky through the grapevine replaced them. From the psychosynthesis group came Alcock, Nicoll, Eder, and Young. Other fr iends of Orage, like Rowland Kenney and Carl Bech hof er Roberts , also attended Ouspensky's lectur es. Orage whipped up more support fr om those to whom he had been a minor guru. There was interest from the Theosoph ists: Ma ud Hoffmann, who was a friend of Mabel Collins, the author of the Theosophical \"classic ,\" Light on the Path , and who shared the house at 146 Harley Street with Maurice Nicoll and James Young, seems to have told Nicoll about Ouspensky even before Orage . Ouspensky's audiences were composed generally of the better-off among the intellectua ls: as Bechh of er Roberts wrote , \"One saw doctors, psychol­ ogists, psycho-ana lysts, editors , write rs, civil serva nts, theosophists of both sexes, clergymen and a sprinkling of the men and women who are always attracted by the lure of the mysterious .\" Orage himself clearly expected that his relationship with Ouspensky would be along the lines of an editorial collaboration with a New Age contributo r. Indeed, his relation ship with Mi trinovic had been conducted on just these terms; and the fo rceful personality of Ouspensky, bearing a mes sage which demanded acceptance of a master-pupil relati onship, was a prof ound shock . Mi trinovic himself came to some of Ouspensky's meetings"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"SUSPENSK 221 and fought hard to retain Orage's allegiance. But the total commitment demanded by Ouspensky overwhe lmed his less impressive argu ments; fo r although Orage may not have known it, such a commitment was what he sought. The teaching which produced such cataclysmic effects was the teaching Ouspensky had absorbed from Gurdjieff. Man is asleep, mechanical ; he has no \"I\" of his own. He must try to awak e, observe him self, and realize his own mechanicalness and the illusory nature of the personality with which he identifies and which manipulates his life. He can do nothing, but must join a group dedicated to waking up. Perhaps then he will discover his \"real 1\" and acquire a soul which he most certainly does not possess. Those who responded to Ouspensky did so according to their diff erent natures and their diff ering pro blems. Nicoll saw the new system as the continuation of his quest, Young as the next step in a scientific inquiry, and to Orage , it may have appeared as a hammer to smash through the unsatisfactory life he had created and penetrate to some truth. To Rowland Kenney, whose air crash had left him \"an insomniac, a writer unable to write, a quivering jelly of fe ars, worr ies, doubts and appre hensions ,\" Ouspensky's broken English opened doors into new rooms of thought. \"My first interest was the purely practical one of the neurotic who wants healing and reassurance that not only\\is life going to be worth living, but that he is again going to be fit fo r active life. 1 am afraid 1 did not find the drastic methods of Ouspensky immed iately eff ective. The devastating emotional upset was not a sedative fo r jangled nerves .\" The brusque treatment of irrelevant questions and the shocks administered by Ouspensky to personal vanities did, in the long run, work fo r Kenney who began to find his needed support in \"the esoteric side\" of Ouspensky's teaching. He reached the conclusion that no liberation in the social sense was possible until there had been a liberation from \"the tyranny of internal things .\" Ouspensky's teach ing methods at this time already resembled those he would continue to use until the beginning of the Second World War. He held meetings several times a week and conducted at least two grou ps: a small body of hard-core enthusiasts and a larger one, probably to act as a magnet and a screening device. He also saw pupils privat ely. At his meetings , he expounded Gurdjieff 's ideas and then invited questions and answers . This constituted the really impo rtant part of the meeting-or so Ouspensky would say in the 1930s- because the right sort of question, which was based on personal experience and sprang from a real desire fo r knowledge , meant that the teacher would answer from his own experience . The questioner would receive hints of where his problem fitted into the vast scheme of human psychology and the universe which was being unfolded gradually and with an irritating arbit rariness before him."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"222 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Ouspensky's methods were those of Gurdjieff in more than the system of question and answer. He would create confusion and uncertainty by changing the dates of meetings, or by telling pupils like Rosa mund Sharp that he wanted to see less of them, only without warning to subject them to a battery of personal interviews. In Ouspensky's mouth, the system assumed the aspect of a scientific, rational approach to the universe and lost much of the eccentricity and exoticism which characterized Gurdjieff's own teaching. James Young recorded the various exercises devised by pupils to assist the process of self-observation . \"Some people took to doing counting exercises in the Undergr ound, instead of staring at their fellow passengers or reading their daily papers; others tried to overcome the 'mechanism' of their dislikes in the matter of food by eating what they would not otherwise have eaten, or the 'mechanism' of their likes by abjuring favourite dishes.\" He thought that \"on the whole, sincerity gained at the expense of material polite ness,\" and that conversation became \"more alive and real,\" but noticed that there was a distinct tendency to observe the mechanical ness of others rather than one's own automat ism. A fascinating glimpse of how a member of Ouspensky's audience might progress from polite interest to a complete commitment to the System is given by a series of letters which Rosamund Sharp wrote to an unnamed correspondent from October 21 to December 7, 19 21. In many ways, Mrs. Sharp provides an excellent example of the sort of person attracted to Ouspensky's lectures. She was the daughter ofE. Nesbit's husband, Hubert Bland, a former leading light of the Fabian Nursery, and-afte r an affair with H.G. Wells-had married Clifford Sharp who, by all accounts, was an unsatisfactory husband. Orage telephoned her and told her that he had found \"a man I could believe in.\" Expecting a psychoana lyst, she was surprised by Ouspensky, whose teaching seemed religiou s, philosophi cal, and analytical all in one. At first she felt that Orage \"had let me in for a lot of stuff that I couldn't understand and that was quite probably useless to me.\" To her great horror, Ouspensky, evidently imitating the practice of Gurdji eff, asked to see her alone. She talked to him in a cafe for two hours and· quelled some of her disquiet. Ouspensky was \"a wonderful person. Incidentally he has the sweetest smile in the world, but that is his only atttaction from an ordinary point of view, counting out his brains, of course .\" Suddenly she discovered an access of energy, and despite lingering doubts about her ability to understand the details of Ouspensky's exposition, life began to seem more worth living. She wrote: \"If there is one grain of truth in it I'm not going to reject it whatever nonsense may surround it.\" The feeling of well-being continued, but her worries were by no means"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"SUSPENSK 223 stilled. Ouspensky's method of question and answer meant that the pupil mU'st painfully piece together the complete system of thought. Rosamund Sharp worried about her own capacity to winkle out the information she needed and envied intellectuals like Orage their ability to fo rmulate questi ons. She call ed the System \"Suspensk .\" Her teacher became more human: the stern exterior of the lecturer with his very short sight and innumerable pairs of spectacles was softened by a visit to the flat in Gwendwr Road and the discovery of his notorious devotion to cats . Cats apart, there were also moments when she ach ieved real contact with the teacher, like that at the very first meeting when she had blurted out, \"Ho w can we get a will?\" and \"Ouspensky sort of switched round in his chair and looked straight at me and began talking about the possibility that man had to awake and fo r a fe w minutes everything became really thr illiug, sort of vibrating with life.\" Her anxiety mounted about the eventual outc ome. She fe lt herself at one end of a long, dark tunnel without the certainty of light at the other. It became apparent that the discipline was changing her, and she worried about losing her fri ends. At the very outset, she had suspected this possibility ; now she fe lt them slipping away . Then the real test began : Ouspens ky- perhaps playing the part that Gurdjieff had played in Dch Darye-s eemed depressed, talked of return ing to Constantinople because things were not going well, gave her to understand that she was the only member of the group who responded more than intellec tualiy to the true significance of his work . Rosamund Sharp hoped that if he did decide to go he would go quickly, while it was still possible fo r her to return to her old interests . She wondered whether she could face this. Her correspondent began fe eling \"change\" in her, accu sed her of unfriendly behavio r. He, too, was slipping away. She knew this and fa ced up to it. Her fr iendship with Orage was also a thing of the past, fo r she had stopped identifying with him. \"Killed by changes in me and in him. We both know this without speaking a word .... \" In all his tea ching, Ouspensky made no secret of the fac ts that the System he taught derived from Gurdjieff, that Gurd jieff was somewhere on the continent of Europe trying to establish a permanent base , and that the London lectur es, the questions and answers , and the basic exercises which included \"se lf-rem embering, \" were only the preliminaries to proper work in a \"scho ol.\" In the winter of 1921-22, Gurdjieff was still in Hellerau, convinced of the possibility of starting work in Germany; but when the Hellerau project fai led, he returned to Berlin. It seems to have been agreed that, because Ouspensky was having some success in London, England was the next best place to try to establish a permanent Institute . In Berlin, Gurdjieff made his pupils learn English, and in London Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE prescribed Russian lessons fo r some of his pupils. It was Gurd jieff's own idea that he visit Eng land, and he arrived in London in February 1922, with Mme. de Hartmann as his secreta ry. \"I at once invited him, as a matter of course, to my lectur es, \" says Ouspensky, \"and introduced him to all who were coming to them .\" Gurd jieff's first introduction to Ouspensky's pupils took place on February 13. According to Orage's notes of the occa sion, Gurdjieff talked chiefly about \"impressions\" and \"energ y.\" As children we acq uire new impressions, he said, but as we grow older, our sensitivity to new impressions wea kens, and they can only be obtai ned by fo rce . Similarly, energy is mechanically acquired and mechanically used; but there are methods fo r obtaining new energy. At this Orage commented, \"pickaxe and pounder, eh?\" A number of interesting observations were made by Gurdjieff that do not seem to appear elsewhere . You may study men by their postures and ju dge nationality by methods of dancing. Each na­ tionality has a diff erent number of movements and the refore of thoug hts. In the same way, all our moods are the result of our e xp eriences, and the trained eye can read th em . If a man's original associatio ns can be trace d, we can create in him any emotion. These topics had obvious ref erence to Gurd jieff's plans fo r an Institute on a large scale . Some of Gurd jieff's audience took fr ight . \"A fe w timid people were .scared away, \" wrote James Young, \"perhaps by his completely shaven hea d. \" It may have been at this first meeting that only one member of the overawed group dared to ask the Master a question- \"What would it be like to be conscious in essence?\" He received the reply: \"Ev erything more vivi d.\" There were no more questions, and Gurd jieff left. The second meeting at which he confronted Ouspensky's group was on March 15. Gurdjieff talked about personality and essence. He said that in Eur ope the term \"hypnotism\" ref erred only to personality . One center might be hypnotized by the others. Again there was talk of a permanent Institute. Individual programs in such an organizat ion, Gurdjieff said, could only be arranged after long study by others and by oneself. The London Institute was destined never to materialize , although a large building in Hampstead had been fo und to house it. The reason was Gurd jieff's fa ilure to obtain a visa, although Bech h8 fe r Roberts says that he would have been allowed to enter Britain if he had left behind all the Russians who fo llowed him fr om Tiflis and Constantino ple. A deputation was org anized by Orage, Maurice Nicoll, and some of the other doctors­ including a bemused surgeon called Kenneth Walker who had been whisked from Harley Street by Nicoll and made to testify before the Home Secretary in fa vor of a man whose name itself was still new to him.

The Londoners still seem to have been hopef ul in late June, but by this time the Home Office was even ca using trouble over a brief visit which Gurdjieff proposed to make fr om Berlin. On the main issue it remained adama nt. The tra veling circus could not enter Brita in. Part of the reason was probably Bolshevophobia. The specter of Red Revolution fr ightened many go vernments at that time, and there was a tendency to see in every Russian a bearded, bomb-secreting anarchist intent on disrupting society. No country in Europe was anxious to admit more than it could absorb of the huge numbers of White Russians pouring out of the Slavic depths. Even though Ouspensky's own position was secure, it might be that his visit to Theosophical headquarters in Adyar had somehow tai nted him with the brush of sedition. Bechh of er Robe rts, who had visited the Theosophists at the same time-when he was only nineteen-had been fo rced to demand an inquiry when he returned home in order to fr ee himself fr om unpleasant surveillance . Neither can Orage's reputation have been exactly fr ee from blemish. There had been a plot to kidnap a Member of Par liament, and the govern ment had thought it worth while to suborn Orage's fr iend and colleague , J. M. Kennedy, to act as an inf ormer on the New Age group . Outweighing all considerations of logic was the fa ct that Gurd jieff was known to have spied fo r the Tsarist gove rnment in Tibe t. It was in Britain on one or another of the trips he made early in 1922, that Gurd jieff was interviewed by security men, but no records are available to clarify the situat ion. Neither is there any evidence fo r Louis Pauw els's claim that the fo rmer French President Poincare intervened personally to procure fo r Gurdjieff the permit which allowed him to settle in France; although , in view of Ushe Narzunoff 's status as an ally of France, there would have been nothing illogical in his doing so. Somehow the permit was obta ined. Gurdjieff moved his Berlin group to Paris, and again began to look fo r a suitable home. Very soon one was fo und in the Prieure des Basses Loges, a chateau some fo rty miles fr om Par is, near Fontainebleau . The Institute fo r the Harmonious Development of Ma n had at last fo und a roof. The money to pay first fo r renting, and then fo r the purchase of the chateau, came fr om Ouspensky's fri ends and pupils in London. Lady Rothermere once more provided funds, but the leading contributor was a rich Yorkshire industrial­ ist named Ralph Philipson . Mrs. Philipson even handed over a valuable string of pearls to Gu rdj ieff , who gave them back. Ouspensky's own attitude toward Gurdjieff was ambivalent : he \"still expected a very great deal more from his work\" but saw a recurrence of \" all the fo rmer obstacles which had begun to appear in Es sentuki .\" For the moment he devoted his energies to supporting Gurd jieff's plans. Some of"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE his London pupils, particularly the ones who had been most forward in trying to establish Gurdjieff in England, decided to \"give up everything\" and go to Fontainebleau. \"In my opinion ,\" wrote Ouspensky,\" some had been in far too great a hurry to give up their ordinary occupations in England in order to follow G.\" Others, who wanted their Master to make the decision for them, he told to wait until he himself had been to the Prieure. In the first week in July, Ouspensky went to Paris where he stayed at the Hotel Solferino in the Rue de Lille. He sent back encouraging messages, but warned his pupils that Gurdjieff's establishment was not yet fully organized. Then in mid-August, he received disquieting news from Orage, whom he had left in charge of the groups in London. Ill-disposed or panic­ stricken people had been sowing rumors among the new recruits who were terrified by tales of madness, sexual scandals, and the dangers said to be attendant on self-observation. Ouspensky wrote to his senior pupils, asking them to suppress the gossip and warning Orage to keep strictly to his instructions. However, the exodus had already begun, although few of the visitors to Fontainebleau can have departed without qualms. Almost the first to go was James Young, who left Harley Street in some confusion of mind. Was he going simply to improve his technique as a psychotherapist? Afterward he declared that he had seen in Ouspensky's exposition of the System a possible way of overcoming the problem of \"failure of the will\" in which he was interested. On the other hand, as an honest man, he had to admit that he could not \"lay claim to such an impersonal motive.\" Maurice Nicoll abandoned his practice, borrowed money from his expectations under his father's will, and left for France with his wife, his sister-in-law, his young daughter, and a nanny. Several patients of Young and Nicoll followed their analysts across the Channel. Rosamund Sharp left for Fontainebleau , as did Rowland Kenney, who arrived in a mood of great surprise that he should be in such a place at all. There were numerous people whose circumstances permitted only week­ end visits or short trips. One of these was J.G. Bennett, the young intelligence officer from Constantinople, who had joined Ouspensky's circle on his return to England. The growth of interest in Gurdjieff's ideas was. like the spreading out of ripples in a pool: Ouspensky's arrival in London had produced an eddy which enclosed Orage and his friends; and their conversio n-for conversion it most certainly was-set off fresh waves through the intellectual world. After Orage had been won over, Gurdjieff and Ouspensky would have been names to conjure within the close-knit intellectual society of the day; but there is no doubt that it was Katherine Mansfield's death at Fontainebleau which introduced them to a wider public."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"• • SUSPENSK 227 Katherine Mansfield was the daughter of a prosperous New Zealand banker. She came to Europe fo r education and stayed to experience lif e . Her tempestuous and theatrical prospecting fo r experience led to a succ ession of lovers , a miscarriage, an abort ion, and an operation which permanently damaged her health . Somehow she contrived an area of equilibrium in the midst of all this turbulence, out of which emerged a series of meticulously observed short storie s. In 1912 she met John Middleton Mur ry, then a hopeful young writer and editor of his own maga zine, Rhythm . They struck up an intense and unstable rela tionship . They lived together, lived separately but near at hand, then each took Hight from the other in order to work. Katherine Mansfield's hysterical tempera­ ment, her insistence on subordinating the responsibilities of personal relati onships to a relentless pursuit of experienc e-- an aspect caricatured by D.H. Lawrence in the character of Gudrun in Women in Love ---c ompli­ cated their lives unbeara bly. In 1916 they lived fo r a while with the Law rences in Cornwall in an abortive experiment in communal lif e. After the war Katherine Ma nsfield's health began to break down in earnest with the onset of tuberculos is; and in the autumn of 1921, she and Mu rry-at last married-were living in Switzerland because of the supposedly beneficial eff ect of the mountain air. From their fr iend, S.S . Koteliansky, K. M. heard about a Russian doctor in Paris who had a new trea tment fo r tuberculo sis, and she became convinced that a cure was possible. To the great distress of Mu rry, who thought that her only chance lay in remaining in Switzerland, she left fo r London in July 1922, ostensibly in order to see a heart speciali st bef ore going on to Paris to begin treatm ent fo r her diseased lungs. In fa ct she had a perf ectly sound heart and the real reason-as Murry afterward belie ved-was to renew her contact with Orage . The relatio nship of the Murrys with the Lawre nces is well known, but that with Orage and Beatrice Hastings was almost equally importan t. It was Orage who had published Katherine Mansfield's first stories in the New Age in 1910. Later Beatrice Hastings was to claim the responsibility. Whatever the truth, Katherine Mansfield fe ll fo r a time under the inHuence of the powerful Mrs. Hastings, and it was to her that she is supposed to have turned in 1911 fo r help in arranging her ab ortion. After she met Murry, her connection with Orage lapsed; for Orage had also been Mu rry's first publisher, and Mu rry's maga zine, Rhythm, was in some ways a rival to the New Age in which it was bitterly attacked . However, when Beatrice Hastings left Orage and went to Paris, the two women again resumed their relatio nship. When the breakup with Orage removed Beatrice Hastings fr om the scene in 1916, the rela tionship of the Murrys and Orage altered once aga in. Next year Orage published some stories of Katherine Mansfield's, and Middleton"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"228 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Mur ry met him fo r what was only the second time in his lif e. Relatio ns between the two men remained aff able but dista nt. Murry was conscious of a rela tionship with Orage which resembled that of opposed magnetic poles. \"He, fa r more than many other men whom I knew far better ,\" Mur ry wrote in 1934, \"was an influence in my lif e: a queer kind of negative influence , no doubt, fo r I was always resisting Orage , but a very real one.\" In the autumn of 19 21, Orag e-- probably remembering Mur ry's bouts of mysticism-suggested that the newly published book of Lewis Walla ce, Cosmic Anat omy, be sent to him in Switzerlan d. \"To such speculati ons,\" wrote Mu rry eight years later, \"I have since learned to attach a meaning, as a sometimes useful method (if used warily) of making the borderlands of psychology acc essible to thought; but at that time they meant nothing- less than nothing; they were positively repel lent. I put the book aside. K. M. picked it up .\" Cosmic Anatomy is a curious book. It is an open question how much Lewis Wallace was in fact the author and how much the book was cobbled together by Orage and the psychosynthe sists to serve as an introduction to Ouspensky's lectur es. It describes an occult system derived fr om Oriental religi ons, Rosicrucia nism, and similar sources which is supposed to be linked to contemporary scienc e-- psychoana lysis, of cour se, and relativi ty. There are striking paral lels with Gurd jieff's own teachings . At all events the , book answered the metaphysical hunger of the times in general, and of Katherine Mansfield in partic ular. From her Russian wonder doctor in Pari s, K. M. fled to Lond on, with the hapless Mu rry fo llowi ng. The goal was Orage , both as mediator of Cosmic Anat omy and as the magnetic personality who had dominated the New Age gath erings. She saw him on August 30, 1922, by which time he had almost certainly resolved to go to Fontainebleau . \"She said it had been wonder­ ful ,\" recalled her fr iend, Ida Baker, \"he had been so aff ectiona te, embracing her and calling her 'darlin g, ' as though in a return to earlier, happier days .\" K. M. recorded the interview in her journal. It typifies the attitude of many people who came to Gurd jieff -a general attitu de, irrespective of personal proble ms, but here expressed with the customary Mansfield powers of observat ion. On that occasion I began by telling him how dissatisfied I was with the idea that Lif e must be a lesser thing than we were capable of \"imagining\" it to be. I had the fe eling that the same thing happened to nearly everybody whom I knew and whom I did not know.

They called this trickling away -greater tolerance-wider interes ts-a sense of proportion-so that work did not rule out the possibility of \"lif e.\" Or they called it an es cape from all this mind-probing and self -consciou sness -a simpler and therefore a better way of lif e . But sooner or later, in literature at any rate, there sounded an undertone of deep regret. There was an uneasiness, a sense of frustration . One heard, one thought one heard, the cry that began .to echo in one's own being: \"I have missed it. I have given up. This is not what I wa nt. If this is all, then Life is not worth livi ng. \" But I know it is not all. How does one know that? Let me take the case of K. M. She has led, ever since she can remember, a very typically fa lse lif e. Yet, through it all, there have been moments, insta nts, gleam s, when she has fe lt the possibility of something quite other. At this point, Katherine Mansfield was living in the house of her fri end, the artist Dorothy Brett, while Murry rented a room next door fr om Boris Anrep. K. M. became completely involved with the group around Orage . This now included another old fr iend, the novelist J. D. Bere sford, who was also atte nding Ouspensky's meetings. The spiritual quest on which they were embarking was contagi ous, but Mu rry remained unaff ect ed. \"I fe lt that the only thing that remained to me-my own integr ity-was at stake . It was not that I fe lt superior to Orage, or J. D. Beresf ord, or James Young, or Maurice Nicoll, who were among Ouspensky's disci ples: still less did I fe el superior to Katheri ne. But I was certain that it wo uld be treachery to myself to fo llow them. I could scarcely bear to discuss the doctrines of Ouspensky with Katheri ne .\" In despair, he began to turn more and more to the teachings of a mystic named Millar Dunning, whom he had met at Gars ingt on, and who also counted J. W. N. Sullivan-still not yet emancipated fr om Aleister Crowley- among his devotee s. Eventually, fe eling lif e \"a kind of torture ,\" Mu rry took flight to Selsfield, the country house of his fr iend Vivian Locke -Ellis. Kathe rine Mansfield had not quite given up hope of making him understa nd.

To Ouspensky, she did not seem to have long to live, but he gave her Gurd jieff's addr ess, and on October 3 she left fo r Pari s. The next day she protested in a letter to Murry: \"I don't fe el influenced by Ouspensky or Dunning. I merely fe el I've heard ideas like my ideas, but bigger ones, far more definite ones. And that there really is Hope-real Hope, not half ­ Hope ... \" Orage himself arrived in Paris on October 14. He was still trying to sell his share of the New Age, but had received a subsidy from Lewis Wallace to speed him on his quest fo r truth . In his brilliant variations on literature, the arts , Theosophy , and social ref orm, he had simply been postponing the inevitable reckoning which his nature had long since dec reed. Fifteen years earlier, he had written in his speculatio ns on the higher fo rms of consci ousness: \"Perhaps the great ways of Relig ion, Art and Love are also the saf e and certain ways . Perhaps it is the racial experience that has named these as the chosen means, the humanly eff ective means. Special means doubtless exist; but special means involve special difficultie s. \" Now special means conf ro nted him which had none of the rigmarole attached to them of the occu ltism which he had earlier aband oned; and he could no longer put . off the atte mpt. The impact of Ouspensky's teach ing on him had simply deepened after the first shock. On May 30, 1922, h e had written to Claude Bragd on: \"Ever since Mr. Ouspensky came to London under Lady Rothe rmere's auspices last Augus t, I have been attending his lectur es, and more and more and still more I find myself absorbing his teaching ... Mr. Ouspensky is the first teacher I have met who has impressed me with ever-increasing certainty that he knows and can do. \" All his resistance had crumbled. C. S. Nott reports that later Orage compared his own situation in 192 1-22 with that of a character called Hamolinadir in Beelze bub's Tales . This character repre sents the man who has \"learned everything\" and fo und no solutions in the knowledge of the scho olmcn. \"H amolinad ir,\" said Orage, \"is a cartoon of the disillusioned modem thinker, whose reason is insufficient fo r ob jective conclusio ns. \" Yet one cannot but fe el that the intellectual baggage of Orage-like that of Ouspensky and of many of Gurd jieff's fo llowers-had been insufficient to weigh him down. The gadfly mind seldom penetrates deeply enough into the disciplines fr om which it draws sustenance to deliver any sort of verdict upon them. Philip Mairet quotes a remark of Ramiro de Maeztu: \"Orage knows the shalles of everything and the weight of nothin g. \" He suggests that Orage fe lt the absence of a solid core of truth to be a flaw which"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"SUSPENSK 231 affected both society and himself. After the Hight of his mistress and in the absence of a cause to dominate , Orage sought a master and a dominating interest. The sovereign alkahest which would reconcile all social and personal contradictions must be God. \"Since in my experience ,\" he wrote after his time at Fonta inebleau, \"evf:lry attempt to establish an ideal and conscious relation between man and man , without taking God into acco unt, has failed, the only remaining hope of the serious social reformer is to 'find religion ,' that is to say, find Go d.\" This has been criticized as rationalizing after the event; but it is perfectly in line with what he had accepted of Gurdjiefl\" s ideas . How can you reform society, the argument runs, when man himse lf is unregenerate? Man is asleep, and you can help at best to wake up only a few. Altruists are self-indulgent people-a nd, of cou rse, asleep . All you can do is try to find your \"real I.\" \"Why must you go?\" asked his devoted secretary, Alice Marks; and Orage returned simply: \"I am going to find God.\" Orage's departure from London was viewed by a far wider circle than that of the New Age office as a tragedy from which the causes he had cham pioned would not recover. Criticism began . Dmitrije Mitrinovic disconsolately, but humorously, watch ed the man he had hoped to make his own Saint Paul submit to the dictates of another gosp el. He complained to Wilma Muir that too many clever men in London were throwing up their jobs and migrating to Fontainebleau because Gurdjiefl' had prom ised that he could raise into full bloom the merest bud of a soul. Yet, after melancholy shakings of the head, Mitrinovic would then gurgle with laughter and cry: \"London is Looney-bin , no?\" . The contrast between the view from \"within\" and the view from \"without\" is absolute . From one point of view, Orage's conversion was incompr ehensible, or a matter fo r censure. From another, it was simply necessary . Once more he made a clean break with his past. The last time he had burned his boats, he salvaged from the ashes three volumes of Nietzsche .

The chateau known as the Prieure des Basses Loges stands at the bottom of a small hill in the village of Avon on the outskirts of Fontainebleau . The building-said to have been designed fo r Mme. de Maintenon-is three stories high and low in proportion to its length. The windows of the two lower stories are flanked by shutters, while those of the upper story project from a gray slate roof. Inside, the ground floor contains the once ornate Em pire drawing room, salon, and library ; the second floor, a set of luxurious bedrooms known by the pupils as \"the Rit z,\" where Gurd jieff and Mme. Ostrowsky had their quarters and where visitors and new arrivals were generally lodged; and the third floor-or \"Monks' Corridor\"-hol ds attic bedrooms where most of the pupils slept. In the courtyard at the chateau entrance is a fo untain-out of whose circular basin Gurd jieff once heaved a car single-ha ndedly-and on the other side of the house, beyond a terrace, is a garden supposed to have been designed by Lenotre . In Gurd jieff's day the garden included an impressive lime avenue and another fo untain used as a swimming pool. When Gurd jieff bought the property, the grounds extended beyond the 45 acres around the house to some 200 acr es, bounded by a stone wall outside of which rose the trees of the Forest of Fontainebleau . Inside the demesne were various auxiliary buildings: a complex of kitche ns and servants' quarters attached to the chateau in an ugly wing; an enormous orangery 232"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARM ONIOUS DEVEL OPMENT OF MAN 233 built almost entirely of glass; and a small house in the gardens known as \"Le Paradou .\" Under Gurd jieff's regime the Paradou housed the children of the colony, who were supervised in a rota by one mother a week . The Prieure was owned by the widow of the advocate Maitre Labor ie, who had been given the chateau in payment fo r his def ense of Dreyf us. After various negotiations carried ou t by Mme. de Hartmann, Gurd jieff first leased, then bought the Prieure fo r 700, 000 fr ancs. But his hopes of immediate occupancy were fr ustrated , and it was not until October 1922, that he was able to move the cara vanserel into his new headquarte rs. The first English pupils fo und Gurd jieff temporarily established in Paris where he hired a house in Auteuil and used the Dalcroze Institute in the Rue de Vaugirard fo r teach ing his movements. In August, James Young arrived to find the pupils occ upied in making costumes fo r public perf ormances which Gurdjieff planned to give. Met alwo rking, embroidery and shoe making were some of the tasks imposed; and many of the new arrivals were strangers to any fo rm of manual labo r. As Young wr ote, they suddenly had to pick up the techniques of several diff erent handicra fts, \"which meant overcom ing one's awkwa rdness and diffidence , and some­ times, be it conf essed, one's indi ffe rence or even dislike . This work was carried on with fe verish act ivity, and occupied , together with the exercis es, thirteen or fo urteen hours every day. The keynote was 'Overcome difficulties-Make eff ort-Wo rk.' ... You may imagine that this kind of communal work, together with misunderst andings that arose fr om language diffi culti es, called upon one's exercise of the virtues of self -remembering, non-identifying and non-considering to the utmo st. \" The Prieure was fully fu rnished, except fo r the fo rmer servan ts' quart ers, but had not been lived in since 1914. The advance party fr om Pans had the task of hacking the grounds into shape and renovating the inside of the building. \"We weeded and trimmed up the almost indistinguishable paths ,\" Young remembered , \"washed all the glass of a large 'orangerie' or vinery, which afterwards became a workshop and smithy -an d, in general, worked like demons .\" When the chateau and the grounds had been made more or less habitab le, Gurd jieff and the main body of pupils arriv ed. A peculiar prospectus was issued in French, entitled, L'lnstitut du Deve loppement Harmonique de ['Homme de G. GurdjieJJ, in which Ouspensky claimed to have had a hand. It began with an account of the expeditions of the Seekers fo r Truth in the Orient and of Gurd jieff's adventures while trying to establish himself in Russia. \"The number of people interested in the basic ideas of the Institut e,\" it clai med, \"is clearly grow ing: there are not fa r off 5, 000 members, scattered about throughout the world .\" Bech hofer Roberts, who visited Fontainebleau as an interested spectato r, remarked that the numbers could safely be reduced to 500; and"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"234 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE in fact, the inhabitants of the Institute numbered between sixty and seventy. At least half of these were Eastern Europea ns; acco rding to Young, \"Russians, Armenians, Poles, Georgians, and even a Syrian .\" They kept themselves aloof , eating in their own dining room and separated fo r the most part from the English pupils by an impassable language barr ier. Of the thirty-odd English residents, many are known by name. There were the doctors : Nicoll, Alcock, Young, and another psychoanalyst named Dr. Mary Bell; half a dozen Theosophically inclined ladies; Orage, Katherine Mans­ field, and other literary converts like Rowland Kenney and Rosam und Sharp . There were a couple of civil servants, among them R. J. G. Mayor, and a diplomat or two. A larger floating population of weekend visitors included the faithful like J. G. Bennett, the intrigued like Clifford Sharp, and the merely inquisitive like Bechhof er Robe rts. It should be emphasized that Gurd jieff's Insti tute-the achie vement fo r which he is generally remember ed-was a limited concern with a finite number of pupils, and that strict supervision was exercised over admission . For exam ple, the skeptical psychical researcher, Dr. E. J. Dingw all, was refused access to Fontai nebleau . According to the prospectu s, Gurd jieff ac cepted pupils of three catego­ ries: those who wished to undergo his educational program , those who metely wanted theoretical instructi on, and those who were his patients in his capacity as physician -hypnoti st. Gurdjieff later published a revised translation of parts of his prospectus-but with the idiom and the presentation somewhat altered. In the winter of 1922-23, he expressed himself in the style of the new psychology, in the tones of a prophet who would have been at home in Edwin Muir's Hellerau : Because of the conditions of modem life, contemporary man has deviated from his original type ; that is to say, from the type which should have been produced by the influence of his envir onment: the circu mstances of the place , the surroundings and the culture in which he is born and grows up. . . . instead of raising man completely to a new degree of develop­ ment, civilization has encouraged the evolution of certain faculties at the expense of others , some of which have been utterly destroye d; . . . Man has become an uprooted creature unable to adapt himself to life and alien to all the circumstances of his present existence . This is what the psychological system of M. Gurd jieff asserts by means. of psycho-analysis, showing by experi ment that the world­ picture of a modem man and its own effect on life are not the personal and voluntary expr ession of his entire being, but that on the contrary"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVEL OPMEN T OF MAN 235 are only the acci dental and automatic manif estations of several parts of him. The prospectus continued with a summa ry of Gurd jieff's doctrine of the three centers, but presented in a completely different way from the \"occult\" version familiar to readers of Ouspensky. Em phasis was placed on the fact that self -observation showed the centers to be uncoordinated, in perpetual conflict , and with different degrees of develo pment. Man must bring his centers into a state of ha rmonious coopera tion. Such a struggle could not be carried out alone, as its dangers demanded specialist instructi on. \"It is indispensa ble,\" the prospectus concluded, \"to develop new faculties which are not given to man in life and which cannot be developed in him by general methods .\" Gurd jieff announced an elaborate program which he divided into theoretical , practical, and medical secti ons. The theoretical side was represented by an extensive series of lectures. Science of the hanrwnious development of man; Psychology of man's inner development. Study of methods of knowledge and of the perf ecting of the I according to the theories of European science and Oriental schools. Experiments and practical work . Application of the psychological method to different sciences; cosmological philosophy ; universal mecha nics. Science of relativ ity. Science of number. Science of Symbols. Astroph ysics, mathemat ics, chemistry ancient and modern (alchemy); ancient medicine, modern Oriental medicine. Com parative study of relig ions. Mythology . Idolatry . Ancient esoteric schools and modem Oriental scho ols. Psychology of art. Ancient and modern philosophy. The practical section comprised \"harmonic rhyt hm ,\" \"special exerc ises fo r the development of mem ory, will, concentration of thought, perce ption, etc.\"; \"MuSic, song, modelling, Orient al dances (sacr ed), drawing, painting, sculpture \"; \"Trades and applied arts-agricu lture, horticulture , market­ garde ning; languag es.\" It was added that \"the teaching and the practice of all these subjects is carried out accor ding to special methods .\" Under the 'medical section' were listed an extraordinary number of \"therapie s,\" including \"hydrothera py,\" \"photothera py,\" \"electrothera py,\" \"magnetotherapy ,\" \"psy chothera py,\" \"dietotherapy ,\" and something called \"duliotherap y.\" · Gurd jieff also procla imed that the Institute contained \"physico -metr ic,\" \"chem ico-analytic\" and \"psycho-experimental\" cabinets. What these were was anybody's guess, but presumably they were part of"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE the well-equipped medical department of the Institute which the prospec­ tus announced side by side with a Journal of the Institute, \"printed in appropriate charact ers.\" As Bechhof er Roberts observed in 1924, the \"cabinets\" had no visible existence, and the \"Medical Section\" was confined to \"a fe w pieces of electrical apparatus of ordinary type.\" Some of the claims in the prospectus could be justified as being allegoric al. One of Gurd jieff's fo llowers has explained \"duliotherapy\" as being \"slave-thera py;\" that is, the total submission to the will of the Master. No doubt the various \"cab inets\" could be simi larly explained -and even the Journal \"printed in appropriate charact ers.\" But it is difficult to explain away the oddest part of Gurd jieff's prospectu s: the \"Individual Hist o­ rometric Record\" designed fo r \"patients\" who were engaged on practical work on themselves, and were fo llowing a program laid down fo r them individually. This strange document consists of a series of blank fo rms on which various medical and psychological particulars were supposed to be entered. On the bottom of each page is the rubric: \"For the terminology of schematic and conventional expressions see the special instructors' man­ ual.\" As far as is known , the elaborate \"Record\" was never used. This does not necessarily mean that it was mere window dressi ng-a lthough , of course, it is quite probable that Gurdjieff was simply trying to blind the intellectuals of the West with their own science . Few detailed medical examinations ever seem to have taken place ; but the divisions which the fo rm distinguishes bear a definite resem blance to stage s through which a pupil might pass under Gurd jieff's supervision. A preliminary assessment, then a two-month period of obser vation , during which the pupil would be s \\\\-i tched rapidly from task to task in order to determine his problems and capac ities; a revised assessment based on how the pupil behaved during the period of probation ; and a definite rec ommendation from Gurd jieff of a particular line of work. It is interesting that the course was conceived in terms of nine months-the period of gestation, which also corre sponds to the points on Gurd jieff's enneagram . It may be that the Record was never used because it was intended fo r pupils fo llowing an individual program­ and that Gurdjieff never proceeded beyond the collective methods which he fo und necessary fo r large numbers of people. As he told Maurice Nicoll, he saw the Institute as \"a hatching place fo r eggs. It supplies the heat. Chicken inside must try to break shell, then help and individual teach ing possible. Until then only collective metho d.\" The collective method included intense application to manual tasks. Building and carpentry-at both of which Gurd jieff excelled-were per­ petually in progr ess. Gardening proceeded from morning to night; and if no work was needed, it was manufa ctured . When Prof essor Denis Saurat, head"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVEL OPMENT OF MAN 237 of the Institut Fran�ais in London, came to visit Orage , he fo und that his fri end had been made to dig an extensive ditch in the garden-but almost at once was directed to fill it in. The pupils did the housework, made costumes fo r the danc es, and took their turn at the onerous duty of \"kitchen-boy\" fo r which the incumbent had to rise at 5 A.M. and be responsible fo r fe eding the entire community. A Russian bath was constructed, with steamroom, hot-room and cold-r oom; and during most of the first winter at the Prieure, the pupils were occupied in erecting the building in the Institute gardens which was afterward known as the Study House. This construction was based on an old aircr aft hangar which Gurd jieff had bought from the French army and which , in the fa shion of the day, James Young calls an \"aerodr ome\"; The walls were lined within and without between the uprights with rough laths. The space between the laths was stuff ed with dead leaves. The laths were then covered over inside and out with . . . a mixture of mud and straw, or hay chopped very small. Stoves were then put in the building and the walls dried and hardened before painting them. The roof was made of tarred fe lt nailed on to the joists; glass extended all the way round the upper half of the wall s. This glazing was improvized from cucumber frames-a really good piece of work . After these had been fixed in position the glass was painted with various designs. The lighting effect was very pleasing. The floor, which was the naked . earth pounded thoroughly and rolled, and dried by means of the stove s, was covered with matting, on which were placed handsome carp ets; -the walls below the windows were hung with rugs in the Oriental fashion. . . . Sometimes ... Gurd jieff would have us out to work at the building until two or three in the morning with the aid of big electric lamps hanging from the rafte rs. . . . Everything was arrange d, or rather disarra nged, so that nobody should be allowed to fa ll into a routine . . . . For a week at a time we would not have more than three or fo ur hours sleep at night, and sometimes even only one. My hands were often so stiff in the morning from digging or pick-axe ing or barrowing . or sawi ng or fe lling trees that the fingers exhibited the phenomenon which is known surgically as \"snap-finger\"; when one had coaxed them to a certain point they suddenly straightened out with a kind of snap. Every night in the study-house people would fall asleep during the mental exercis es. On one occa sion a pupil who had been working on the Study House roof fell asleep between two beams, and only prompt action by Gurdjieff"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"238 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE prevented a trag edy. It was small wonder that the day at the Institute began at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. \"This may sound a fa irly late hour fo r so monastic an institution ,\" Bec hhofe r Roberts admitted, \"but you must remember that they probably went to sleep only about fo ur or five o'clo ck. It is one of Gurd jieff's doctrines that out of the seven or eight hours sleep of the normal man half are wasted in the process of 'fal ling aslee p,' whereas the only period that matters is passed in 'deep sleep .' This last can be gai ned equally by spending less time abed and being more prepared to fa ll quickly into it from fa tigue .\" Pupils sometimes slept fo ur to a room, on matt resses on the floor, with no comf orts-and to many of the English pupils this was unheard-of privati on. Until noon there was work : in the house, with the fa rm animal s-co ws, goa ts, sheep, pigs and poul try-wh ich were acqu ired, or in the gr ounds. At noon there was a meal consisting usually of bread and soup, a spare diet which greatly shocked most of the English arrivals , and which, a Daily News reporter complained, \"an English working man would scorn .\" After the meal and a short rest, the pupils returned to work fo r the afte rnoon . In the early evening, they had some time to themselves before gath ering at nine or ten o'clock, occasionally fo r a sessi on of questions and answers held by Gurd jieff, but mostly fo r instruction in his movements. At first these classes were held in the salon of the chateau , but after the completion of the Study House that building became the center of the most eye-catching aspect of Gurd jieff's teach ing. The Study House could hold some 300 people . Gurdjieff decorated it in a style probably based on a dervish tekke . Immediately in front of the stage stood a fo untain which was illuminated during perf ormance s. Facing the stage at the far end of the Study House was a curtained booth in which Gurd jieff could sit partially conceal ed. On the balcony a b ove hung a collection of mus ical instruments. Around the walls ran a continuous low divan covered with Oriental carpets on which the pupils sat to watch the others perf orm-men on one side and women on the other. The audience was separated from the central area of the Study House by a gangway and a low wo oden ra iling. Above them, the ceiling was covered in swathes of material decorated by de Salzmann with a pattern in which the enne agram occ upied a central position. Around the eaves of the building Gurd jieff placed a series of texts written in a peculiar scrip t: \"Here one can only direct and create conditions but not hel p,\" one ran; aga in: \"We can only strive to be able to be Christia ns\"; or, \"Remember that work here is not for work's sake but a mea ns .\" It was the Study House which visitors remembered, whether those who came from Fontainebleau to attend demonstrations of the movemen ts , or the interested spectators fr{)tD England who were trying to learn more"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMEN T OF MAN 239 about Gurd jieff's work. In February 1923, a Daily News reporter inter­ viewed Gurd jieff in the Study House and fo und him uncharacteristically explicit about the purpose of the exotic surroundings . The Study-House is not yet complete, gorgeous as is the interior. Gur dj ieff told me that he is having built a special organ, unique in Europe, with the octa ves in quarter tones. Muc h also remain s to be done in other parts of the House. Soon the fo untain will diffuse a diff erent perfume fo r every hour, and other fo untains are yet to be installed . By this elaborate combination of appeals to the senses, Gurdjieff believes he is providing so many aids to meditati on. \"The senses should be gently distract ed,\" he said, \"and then the mind itself untrammeled by the senses is fr ee to work . Only by such means can it be brought into the way of harmonious development together with the body and with the emotions .\" By this time it was clear that Gurd jieff's \"dances\" could be divided into three gro ups. There were the dances, ritua ls, and fr ag ments of traditional lore which he claimed to have collected during his Eastern trave ls; then there were some broadly dramatic interpretations like the one called the \"Initiation of the Priest ess\"; the third category of \" movements\" or exercises was based on the principle of keeping the various \"centres\" working at fu ll stretch . James Young compared the effect of such exhausting undertakings to the children's game in which you try to pat the top of the head at the same time as rubbing the stomach with a circular motion. \"The will finds it dt8icult,\" he remarked , \"to combine two such una ccu stomed movements and to keep them clear-cut and regular at the same time. The exercises were mostly devised on these lines, and some of them required the combination of fo ur diff erent movements, each of which had its own distinct rh ythm. To atte mpt these exercises involved great strain, and to continue . ti>r any length of time was very fatigu in g. \" It was not the body alone which was exercised in this way. Some of the move ments were governed by complex counting exercises which the pupils had to perf orm in order to keep in time with the others . The exercise described by Ouspensky which entailed the repetition of a series of \"Oms\" is one exam ple; although Gurdjieff could be much more adroit in devising aids to mental ag ility. As purely mental exercise s, he would make pupils learn Morse Code, or memorize lists of Tibetan wor ds, or expect them to know the script in which his texts were written on the Study House roof. They were also compelled to learn an arithmetic where all the laws were distort ed. \"A series of state ments was made ,\" James Young remembered,"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"240 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE \"such as 2 X 1 = 6, 2 X 2 = 12, 2 X 3 = 22, 2 X 4 = 40, 2 X 5 = 74. Find the proc ess by which these results are arrived at. In this case, to the first product 4 is added, to the next 8, to the next 16, and so on.\" Operations of this sort determined the movements of individual dancers who were thus fo rced to exercise both mental and physical \"centres\" simultaneously. \"No great value was attached to these things in themselve s,\" Young wrote of the mental exerc ises. \"The value lay in the amount of eff ort expended on them .\" But did the dances in fact tran scend this limited goal of \"making effort\"? To some it seemed not merely that they had a validity in themselves-as an \"artistic\" achievement -but that in some way they aligned the pupil with the harmonies of the univer se. A writer who has taken part in Gurd jieff's movements has explained this in terms of what seems a very strange coincidence . As well as the mental exerci ses and the physical movements, Gurd jieff would give a subject fo r meditati on: an exercise fo r the \"emotional centr e.\" Once, this particular pupil was being instructed in a movement fo r which the meditation had not yet been given. Quite unbidden, there overcame her a fe eling of extraordinary regret that her rela tionship with her mother had not been one of greater understand­ ing. Then the instructor gave the subject fo r meditation: \"the grief we have cau sed our parents\" ... Yet Gurdjieff often gave only the bare bones of a movement and left his senior pupils to work out his intenti ons. * The same was true of the music, which was interpreted by Thomas de Hartmann fr om Gurd jieff's skeletal indicat ions of melody, rhyt hm, and harm ony. But the music, too-played either by de Hartmann or by Gurd jieff himself on his hand-operated portable organ-has been experienced as the music of the spher es: people have claimed that Gurd jieff's \"Temple Mu sic\"-re sembling plainsong -can provoke precise reacti ons in its hear ers. In 1927 Carl Zigro sser visited Fontainbleau and later described the effect which the music had on him. \"Usuall y,\" he wrote , \"music prompts me to day-dreams and lovely fancies . . . this music did not carry me out of myself at all; it centered its effect upon my very essence, it appealed directly to my emotions. It sang as if it had a messa ge fo r me alone in the world- yet others have since told me that they had precisely the same fe eling. It aroused in me at will the feelings of joy, pity, sorrow, fe ar, strugg le, and above all an exquisite yet terrible yearning ... \" However it must be said that at least to one music critic sympathetic to the Work, the Gurdj ieff-de Hartmann music has very little to reco mmend it; and fa r from lifting the mind to a higher plane, anchors it *T his fa ct has recently been made the basis of a def ense in a lawsuit between Gurdjieff\"s fa mily and those who carry on his work.

It is certainly instructive to compare the pieces based on Oriental themes with those of de Hartmann's contempor aries-such as Dvorak-who devoted a less \"esoteric\" touch to compositions based on fo lk motif s. To many of those who have taken part in Gurd jieff's movements, they and the music together provide the key to his teac hing. Even those who were merely spectators have been transfixed. In November 1922, Kath­ erine Mansf ield described a dance of some seven minutes durati on: \"it conta ins the whole life of woma n,\" she wrote to her husband, \"-but everyt hing! Nothing is left out. It taught me, it gave me more of woman 's life than any book or poem. There was even room fo r Flaubert's Coeur Simple in it, and fo r the Prince ss Marya ... Mysteri ous.\" The Prieure was a house of meanings, isolated fr om the surrounding world by a wall and a philosophy of detachm ent. To the village of Avon the inmates seemed to be a collection of millionaire neurasthenics and, apart from the trade smen, they dismissed the Institute as a maison des fo us. On Saturday evenings, Gurd jieff held public performances of his movements and could often count on an audience drawn by curio sity. But he attracted no real interest from the local community or the town of Fontainebleau . Sometimes the Mayor or the Prefect of Police would be lavishly entertained at one of Gurd jieff's Oriental banquets-the Master was always concerned to keep on good terms with the authorities-but in general , the house and its inhabitants were cut off from the outside world . When a new arrival approached the little gate house of the Prieure and tugged at the bell-pull labeled \"Sonn ez fo rt,\" he was deliberately leaving one attitude to life fo r anoth er. \"I cannot develop you,\" said Gurdjieff. \"I can only create the cOndit ions fo r you to develop yoursel f. \" Upon the pupil's ability to adopt a new attitude to his experiences depended his vision of the Prieure . To put into words what a pupil fe lt went on at the Prieure is difficult. The proximity of the Master gave an extra charge to the atmosphe re, an added intensity of perce ption, and when coupled with the teachi ng of self­ observ ation, might indeed be said to raise the consci ousness of the pupils in the sense of making them more aware of their functioning as human mac hines. There was meaning in everything, particularly in one's own reaction-if the dancing of a mechanical toy could be called its own-to unusual situati ons, hard work, and extraordinarily complicated exercis es. From the moment of entrance into the community, conditions were arranged so as to grate against a pupil's \"mechani sm.\" Maurice Nicoll was fo rbidden to read ; another pupil who could not bear the sight of blood was given the task of slaughtering animals fo r fo od. And the most humdrum situation-which in ordinary life would have been ignored or accepted­ could provide material out of which to build new meanings.

But the point is there is hope. One can and does believe that one will escape from living in circles and will live a CONSCIOUS life. One can , through work, escape from falsity and be true to one's own self-not to what anyone else on earth thinks it is. \" Self-observation has been defined by one of Gurd jieff' s fo llowers as doing everything \"as if God were watc hing. \" The activity was undoubtedly easier in the presence of God's deputy, the ever-pre sent, awf ul Mr. Gurd jieff . A sober British businessman attended a demons tration in the Study House and fo und himself inspected by the Master. \"Du ring the perf ormance I was conf ronted by Gurd jieff hims elf; and fo r one whole minute I fe lt myself examined and alone. All this sounds fa nciful as I record it, but at the time it was a unique experience .\" At the same time as fo rcing his pupils to self­ exam inati on, Gurd jieff's mercurial change s of character baffied those who had first come in contact with the more straigh tforward Ouspensky. \"I have �en him perf orm marv els,\" wrote Rowland Kenney, \"I have known him to act like a petulant, spoilt chil d.\" Gurd jieff was everywhere and all-powerf ul. He delegated the classes in movements to younger pupils, and his personal staff -the de Salzmanns, de Hartmanns and Dr. Stoerne val-ac ted as his deputie s. Yet he did so much hims elf that accounts of the Institute often leave as their chief impression that of its director's manic acti vity. When in late December 1922, there was a fire in the Prieure which burned out two of the rooms, Katherine Mansfiel d described to Mur ry how Gurd jieff had appeared in the midst of the chaos with a hammer, knocking down the burning wall. In February 1923, Denis Saurat watched him trying valiantly to save a burst boiler by bombarding it with lumps of clay which might plug the crack in its side. Besides these feats of inspired improvisati on, Gurdjieff supervised the building projects, interviewed pupils personally, ane at any moment might appear in the house or gard ens encouraging the workers to \"super-efforts\" with cries of \"Sk orry!\" \"Queeker!\" He spared no one and might rouse the whole household in the early hours of the morning to perf orm some newly devised task.

Some pupils like James Young remained immune fr om the infecti on, and Maurice Nicoll wondered \"whether the difficulties Gurd jieff knows he creates are equal in value fo r work with those he does not know he creat es.\" Yet to many otherwise intelligent men and women the Master was little short of divine, and no doubt the presence of a large Theosophical element among his fo llowers encouraged the less strong willed to couple Gurd jieff's name with those of Hima layan Mahatmas. An account of the Prieure which Maud Hoffm an published in the New York Times in February 1924 is so studded with enthusiastic expressions-\"luxur ious ,\" \"heavenly ,\" \"beauti­ ful,\" and the rest-that an inquirer might fe el justified in believing the wors t. Such reacti ons have been responsible fo r much of the hostile criticism which Gurd jieff encountered. When a man's powers have been exalted to the skies, when his too schwiirmerisch supporters insist on viewing him through rose-colored glasses, critics who decide that he does not live up to the image created by the faithful are likely to be virulent. Partly this was the fault of Gurd jieff's sillier fo llowe rs; but partly, also, it was a danger of his method. In 1924, Bechhof er Roberts satirized the react ions of some of the over hopef ul: I used to hear what a wonde rful worker Gurd jieff was. Rapt disciples told me with bated breath of the abnormal speed and skill with which he built paths, fo r example, or sawed wood, laid bricks and designed ovens and even a kippering-k iln. But recenly I have noticed an element of doubt in these accounts. The paths wear badly, the walls crack , the ovens do not fu nction and the kiln no longer kippers. Is it possible that Gurd jieff is not the super-artisan he is supposed to be? Perha ps; but there is also anothe r explanation fo r these mischanc es, which has often been put fo rward by the editor [Orag e]. \"It is a test,\" he declare s, explaining that Gurd jieff could, of course, do it all much better if he wished, but he is anxious to test the fa ith and devotion of his pupils. In such an atmosphere it was difficult to make any balanced assessment of Gurdjieff. His rages might very well be a \"tes t\"-and more than one person has reported that Gurd jieff might abruptly switch off a How of abuse and tum to wink at a bystander -but equally they could be real. A complete outsider might fail to grasp that anything apart from the obvious was happening at all. Or if he sensed something . . . below the surface . . . he fe lt shut out, deprived, the butt of a private joke. The business man who had been \"exam ined\" by Gurd jieff in the Study House \"felt like an outsider; like a visitor to a sanatoriu m.\" The fe eling of exc lusion might grow until"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"244 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurdj ieff's influence over his pupils appeared sinister and potentially harmful: the hypnotized sheep of a Black Magician. Eventually some of the pupils themselves would begin to wonder . . . and this was an effect which did not displease Gurd jieff . \"Do you kno w, \" asked Denis Saurat, \"that some of your disciples are close to despair?\" \"Yes,\" Gurdjieff replied, \"there's something sinister in this house, and that is necessary .\" The contradictory nature of the Institute could be caught in a visit of a single weekend. One pupil who arrived from Ouspensky's London group had her first glimpse of Gurd jieff in the Study House directing the movements. The pupils had to hold their arms outs tretched paral lel with the grou nd; hold them steady fo r several minutes, hold them, HOLD THEM - and the brutal taskmaster did not let the poor creatures relax their taut muscles until the nerves of the visitor from London were screa ming their own prote st, and her anger at the director of this torture chamber burst into a smouldering rage . The next morning the visitor was gathering wood in the garden when she suddenly felt the presence of someone behind her. It was Gurdj ieff, who smiled -not just charmingly, but kindly, with his eyes-as he wished her good morning. She had the sensation of being conf ronted by two different creatu res-or were they merely two aspects of the same man, whose ability to don masks at will or to mobilize functions of the human being to order, began to edge her mind toward a new comprehension of , what the individual might do to becom e his own master? What was going on? It took several highly intelligent men many months to discover, and in some cases to resolve their perplexity . During the con struction of the Study House, Maurice NicolI asked Gurdjieff why he did not build more solidly. Gurdjieff replied: \"This is only temporary . In a very short time everything will be different. Everyone will be elsewhere. Nothing can be built permanently at this moment. \" Then why the whole elaborate structure of an Institute, why the publicity which Gurd jieff seemed increasingly to seek? The answers to these questions can only be suggested in terms of individual pupils who stayed at Fontainebleau . The nature of Gurd jieff's Inst itute cannot really be conveyed in generalitie s, because it dealt in specifi cs. \"For some of us the building is a temple; fo r others a theatre ,\" the Daily News reporter was told by a Russi an who showed him the Study House. \"Some of us meditate ; others dream, and many worship, but we all learn. \" The Institute, like its Master, is sometimes scarcely visible: now a pala ce, now a pigsty; sometimes an elegant chateau infested by a crew of intellectual riffraff, sometimes a spiritual Neuschwanstein or Fonthill, crowned with pinnacles and battl ements which disappear into the mist.

PROBLE MS: A surfeit of \"life,\" dissatis­ faction with human relationships, consciousness of an inevitably approach­ ing death . On Friday, 13, October 1922, Katherine Mansfield reached Paris with her devoted companion, Ida Baker. She was still undecided whether or not to go to Fontainebleau and still concealing from Middleton Mu rry the real purpose of her flight to France . She took rooms in a hotel in the Place de la Sorbonne and wrote as cheerf ully as she could to Mu rry at Selsfield, encouraging him to enjoy the pleasures of human companionship and living with wealthy fr iends. Yet on the very day of her arrival , she had confided to her journal that she and Mur ry were \"no longer together\"-but was she now \"in the right way\"? Her answer is based on a self -analysis acco rding to Ouspensky's teaching of the \"many I's.\" \"No, not yet. ... I fe el a bit of a sham ... And so I am. One of the K. M.' s is so sorry. But of course she is. She has to die. Don't fe ed her. \" Her physical distress had produced an inability to work; and gradually the cultivation of the \"I\" which wanted to go to Gurd jieff produced a conscious decision. This was still bound up with her hopes of a physical cure, and she wrote to Mu rry: I am going to Fontainebleau next week to see Gurdjieff. I will tell you about it. Why am I going? From all I hear he is the only man who understands there is no division between body and spirit, who believes how they are related . You remember how I have always said doctors only treat half. And you have replied: \"It's up to you to do the rest .\" It is. That's true. But first I must learn how. I believe Gurd jieff can teach me. Next day was her birthday and she replied to Mur ry's invitation to join him at Selsfield. \"I do think Selsfield sounds perf ect, but it's no good my Coming there while I am a creeping worm . When I can fly I will come .. .\" Flying meant being \"conscious of a purp ose, \" refusing to live life mechanically \"j ust as the pendulum swin gs.\" Her old striving fo r experi­ ence now appeared only the manif estation of unconscious, mechanical eXistence . That day F. S. Pinder arrived to see her with James Young, who had come up from Fontainebleau to meet Orage off the boat-tra in. He gave her a medical examina tion-probably at the insist ence of Gurd jieff , who had"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"246 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE had a private letter from K. M.' s own doctor advising him to tum her down as a pupil. \"He spent a couple of hours with me, talking about Gurdjieff and the Institute.

I still hope to go on Monday and I'll take a toothb rush and peigne and come back on Wednesday morning, only. \" This was equivoca tion; fo r she was at last clear in her own mind. On the same day she made a lengthy entry in her journal, to try and organize her thoughts . \"Ever since I came to Paris I have been as ill as ever. In fact, yesterday I thought I was dying. It is not imagination . My heart is so exhausted and so tied up that I can only walk to the taxi and back . I get up at midi and go to bed at 5:30. I try to 'work' by fits and star ts, but the time has gone by.\" She faced the fact that she lived the \"life of a corp se,\" and that she was still \"an absolutely hopeless invalid .\" \"What is my life?\" she asked herse lf, and answer ed: \"It is the existence of a parasite .\" Then out of her misery burst a cry from the inner depths. \"I am so terrified of what I am going to do .\" \"Why hesitate?\" she demanded. Was it not because she fe ared to lose Mur ry? But what was their relati onship anyway ? Mur ry knew her only as a dream-a dream of the day when she would be better. \"Theref ore,\" she encouraged herself, \"if the Grand Lama of Thibet promised to help you­ how can you hesitate? Risk! Risk anything! Care no more fo r the opinions of others, fo r those voice s. Do the hardest thing on earth fo r you. Act fo r yoursel f. Face the trut h.\" At first she decided that she would send her conclusions to Mur ry and tore the pages fro m her journal, adding phrases to reassure him. \"And when I say 'I fe ar'-d on't let it disturb you, deare st heart. We all fear when we are in waiting-ro oms. Yet we must pass beyond them ... \" On the seventeenth, K. M. took what she called \"my first Leap in the Dar k.\" She and Ida Baker traveled to Fontainebleau where they were met by James Young and inst alled in a temporary room . From afar Katherine Mansfield observed the Master. \"He looks exactly like a desert chief. I kept thinking of Dought y's Arabia .\" Next day she was moved to 'the Ritz' and it was decided that she could stay fo r a fo rtnight under observation, Gurdjieff himself was fully occu pied with the preliminary organization of the Institute and had only time fo r a fe w words spoken through an interpreter. \"Mr. Gurd jieff is not in the least what I expect ed,\" she told Murry. \"He's what one wants to find him, really . But I do fe el absolutely confident he can put me on the right track in every way , bodily and t'other govern or. \" She was very well looked afte r. \"I have a lovely sumptuous room-a kind of glorified Garsingto n-f or the fo rtnight .

M.s last link with her old life, and on the day of her departure , K. M. wrote to S. S. koteliansky of her own \"private revolution .\" She had moved fr om the world of ordinary life into Gurd jieff's rea lm. Probably she had long ago abandoned any real hope of a physical cure . But if Prospero could not raise Mir anda fr om the dead, he might be able to wake her up. The world as I know it is no joy to me and I am useless in it. People are almost non-existent. This world to me is a dream and the people in it are sleepers . I have known just instances of waking but that is all. I want to find a world in which these instances are united . Shall I succee d? I do not know . In contra st to the ordinary wor ld, immersed in its drea ms, life within the walls of the Prieure was more intense than she had ever known it. \"One has, all the tim e,\" she wrote to Murry on October 20, \"the fe eling of having been in a wreck and by the mercy of Providence got ashore ... somewhere . Simply everything is diff erent. Not only language , but foo d, wa ys, people , music, metho ds, hours-all . It's a real new life.\" At first she was officially on her fo rtnight's probat ion, and because her physical condition prohibited any great exertio n, Gurd jieff instructed her to observe the other pupils at work. She surveyed the trench digging in the gar den, wat ched Gurd jieff and de Salzmann perform expertly in the carp enter's shop, and sat amid the turmoil of the kitchen while the cooks clattered uten sils and sang, Gu rdj ieff and a dog intervened to complicate the action, \"!ami \"at leaSt 20 pots\" bubbled on the stove . Gradually she was drawn into a more active role. She studied rug making, looked after the indoor flow ers, learned Russian, and watched the movements clas ses in the salon where she also took part in Gurd jieff' s counting exerc ises. \"In fac t, at 34 I am beginning my education ,\" she infOrmed Murry in late November; and then, rueful ly, when fa ced with the prospect of maki ng costumes fo r Gurd jieff's pro jected demonst rati ons: \"All the things I have avoided in life seem to find me out her e.\" She recorded external events fo r Murry's benefit, but despaired of conveying their interior content. \"I cannot expr ess myself in writing just now, \" she admitted on October 2 7 . \"The old mechanism isn't mine any longer, and I can't control the new. \" Literary ambitions occas ionally resu rfaced-but always in the distant future, when she should be fit to write .

Burn every single boat fo r once !\" Next day she wrote severely about the lack of a real relati onship between them; there existed only \"the possibility\" of a relati onship. But by November 2, this was retracted in a fit of remorse, as she insist ed that she was dramatizing the existence at Fontainebleau. Five days later the sense of living outside the world had returned. \"In three weeks here I fe el I have spent years in India, Arabia, Afg hanistan , Persia ... And how one wanted to voyage like this . . .\" Part of the extraordinary atmosphere was produced by the intensity of personal contact between the inmates of the colo ny. She was irritated by \"some of the English, 'arty' and theosophical people ,\" but enthused over the \"truly wonder fu l\" \"advanced men and women\" and wrote telling Mur ry of her encounters with the de Salzmanns, the de Hartmanns and \"Olgivanna\"-Olga Ivanovna Lazovich Milanov Hinzen­ burg, who had joined Gurd jieff in Ti£lis as a society lady with a hous eful of servants and now fo und herself cleaning out her Master's pigs. \"Friendship. The real thing that you and I have dreamed of. Here it exists ... \" By mid­ November, Mur ry was becoming concerned that his wife was \"hypnot ised.\" She replied trying to explain her situati on. Dear Bogey, I'm not \"hypnotiz ed.\" But it does seem to me there are certain people here who are fa r beyond any I have met-of a quite different order. Some-most -of the English here don't even catch a glimpse of it. But I am sure. I remember I used to think-if there was one thing I could not bear in a community, it would be the women. But now the women are nearer and far dearer than the men. Of course , I don't speak of Mr. Gurdj ieff. I couldn't say he was near or dea r to me! He is the embodiment of the life here, but at a remote dis tance . Toward the end of November, Murry became irritated by the luxury of Selsfield. He decided to try and find a cottage to share with J. W. N. Sullivan, whose wife had left him after the coup� had become entangled with Aleister Crowley the previous year. He and Sullivan drifted closer to Mil lar Dunning and began to look fo r a cottage near the arti st's colony in the village of Ditchling where , besides Dunning, Eric Gill and his Guild of Cra ftsmen had settled. Dunning was a mystic in a Whitma nesque mould. His one published volume, The Earth Spirit (1920), contai ns a series of meditations on natural landscapes interspersed with prophecies of a coming New Age. For Murry,"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVEL OPMENT OF MAN 249 Dunning's importance was that he practiced Raja-yoga and provided some practical discipline which could be seen as a counterpart to the austerities which K. M. was undergoing at the Prieure. On December 9, Katherine Mansfield wrote to her husband about a conversation she had had with Alexander de Salzmann on poverty of spirit-\"To be poor in ideas, in imaginati on, in impulses, in wishe s-to be simple, in fa ct.\" \"I hope you will meet this man one day,\" she wrote; and Mur ry replied fr om Ditc hling: ... if you have your Salzmanns, whom I should dearly love to know, I have my Dunnings, whom I would dearly love you to know. And every letter of yours that I get makes me fe el more than ever that we are marc hing along parallel paths-paral lel paths which converge, and that the day is not so terribly fa r distant when we shall be ready fo r one anothe r. Despite K. M.' s earlier atte mpts at proselytizing, Mur ry's new occult interests rang a little strangely in her ears. At the end of November she wrote that she was glad that he was going to live near Dunning. But had he not been joking when he told her that the Prieure might be \"his Wa y\"? \"One can only come here via Ouspensk y,\" she warn ed, \"and it is a serious step.\" Before Christmas she had accepted \"your Dunnings\" and Mur ry's aspirati ons. But her first reaction had been based on a surer knowledge of her husband, whose devotion to yoga proved a temporary phase. Under Dunning's tuition he experienced a vision of the crux ansata, but was left unmoved on being told that it was a symbol of imm ortality . In a fit of revulsion he aba ndoned all mystical practic es. He had wanted to spend Christmas with his wife at Fonta inebleau, but she hastened to put him off. The hotels in the town would be closed, and the Institute itself was still in cha os, so he could not stay as a guest. She herself had been moved from \"the Ritz\" into a tiny room in the Monks' Corridor which she shared with Olgivanna. Her letters tread a wary path between trying to give Mur ry a true picture of the discomf orts of her life­ that first winter the cold was intense and fu el was scarce-and continuing to communicat e the benefits which she fe lt she derived from her stay . She e xplai ned that her change of room was part of Gurd jieff's discipli ne: \"It is a . favo urite habit of his to set the whole house walki ng. Easy to see why when one saw the emotions it aroused .\" But her exile fr om \"the Ritz\" lasted only for a month. On December 17, she wrote that the room had taught her \"to rough it in a way you and I have never done ,\" and continued in amaz ement: \"But how did Mr. Gurdjieff know how much I needed that experience?\" What was more, just as she fe lt that she had learned her lesson and was plunging into real despair, Gurd jieff himself had appeared with words of"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"250 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE comfort and ordered her back to \"the Ritz.\" \"Sometimes I wonder if we 'make up' Mr. Gurd jieff's wonderful understa nding. But one is always getting a fresh example of it. And he always acts at precisely the moment one needs it. That is what is so strange . . .\" Gurd jieff had directed a balcony to be built fo r his invalid pupil above the animals-three cows and a mule-in the cowshed of the Institute . On this balc ony, Katherine Mansfield now spent th e day lying on a divan, receiving visits from her friends and watc hing the cows being milk ed. What was the reason fo r this strange regime? Animal mag netism? The smell of manure? Because Indian medicine recommends the breath of cows- those bacillus­ carrying animal s-as a specific fo r tuberculo sis? All these possibilities have been sugge sted; but not the simplest one. It had been clear to Ouspensky (and would have been even clearer to Gurdjieff, with his greater medical know ledg e), that Katherine Mansfield had not long to live. Gurdjieff had agreed to admit her to his community; but although she was in need of spiritual help as well as physical , her invalid condition disqualified her from full participation. Her everyday contact with other people provided an opportunity to \"work on the emotio ns\"; but in Gurd jieff's opinion, she probably needed, as much as the latter, to regain contact with the soil and her body. She had herself fe lt the need to learn to look after animals, though a view from the stable balcony was as much as could be manage d. Her gallery was decorated by de Salzmann with caricatures of memb�rs of the Institute , camouflaged as birds and beasts . The canopy above was painted with suns, moons, and stars edged in red and blue. After K. M.' s death, critics singled out the apparently grotesque circums tances of her last days . Her friends at the Institute reacted by stressing how happy she had been. Some of their reports are overreactions to criticism of the \"Gu rdjieff killed Katherine Mansfield\" variety; but it seems certain from the accounts of Olgivanna and the young Lithuanian, Adele Kafian, that the dying woman was indeed determined to find \"sermons in stones and good in everythi ng.\" At the same time there is an undertone of sorrow, masked a little by the fe stivities of Christmas which was celebrated with Gurd jieff's customary exubera nce. On December 23, Murry was told of Gurd jieff's decision that, \"although there are so fe w of them,\" the English should celebrate Christmas on the twenty-fifth and not wait until the Russian Christmas in the New Year. At the Master's expense they were to invite the Russians to a fe ast. \"And he has given us a sheep, a pig, two turk eys, a goose, two barrels of wine, whiskey, gin, cognac, etc., desserts of all kinds, an immense tree and carte blanche with which to decorate it. \" K. M. felt compelled to watch the slaughter of the animals fo r food . \"I attended the obsequies of the pig this morning. I thought I had better go through with it fo r once and see for"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVE LOPMENT OF MAN 251 myse lf. One felt horribly sad . . . And yesterday I watched Madame Ouspensky pluck, singe and draw our birds. In fact these hav e been gory days , balanced by the fairy-like tree. There is so much life here that one feels no more than one little cell in a beef steak, say. It is a good fe eling. \" Katherine Mansfield took part in the Christmas celebrations a nd watched the distribution of presents to the children of the commun ity-always a high point in Gurd jieff's year. On her return to her room, she discovered that Adele Kafian had arranged a private Christmas tree which she had dug up in the fo rest. On it were burning three candle s, which sh e had lit to symbolize herself, her fr iend, and Middleton Mu rry. The two friends sat \"in silence\"-in Adele's words-\"l ooking at our Christmas tree. One candle burnt badly, it flickered and began to go out.-' Tha t's me, ' she whispered. No, No! I jumped up and put the others out first. This was her last Christmas tree. I did not know then the superstition about thre e candl es.\" At least half -consciously anticipating her death, K. M. wrote again to Middleton Mur ry on Boxing Day. She fe lt her letter to be \"flat and dul l,\" but it gives the impression of a report fr om some fa r outpost of the world-a strange place where she drank koumiss on her gallery while discussing astrology or watch ing Gurd jieff milk a goat in Arab fas hion by securing its hind legs acro ss his knees with an unbreakable grip. Somehow her experiences had produced in her an attitude of fa ith. . . . If I were allowed one single cry to God, that cry would b e: I want to be REAL. Until I am that I don't see why I shouldn't be at the mercy of the old Eve in her various manif estations fo r ever. But this place has taught me so fa r how unreal I am. It has taken from me one thing after another (the things never were mine) until at this present moment all I know really, really is that I am not annihilated and that I hop e-- more than hop e-- believe. It was the final letter to Mu rry in which she described the lif e of the community at Fontai nebleau. Her last letter of all concern s Mur ry's traveling arrang ements. Gurd jieff had agreed that he should come to stay tor a week in January; a week which was to include the opening of the Study House on the thirteent h-the Russian New Year. K. M. waited in growing excite ment fo r the visit to take place ; and shortly before Murry arriv ed, she made a breakthrough which was to present her husband with a more complete person than he had previously known . , Orage recorded the nature of this breakthrough in his article, \"Talks with Kat herin e Mansfiel d,\" which he wrote the fo llow ing year. He rememb ered how often during their first months at the Institute he and K. M. had discu ss ed the strange phenomenon of their vanished interest in literature ."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE \"'What has come over us?' she would ask whimsically . 'Are we dead? Or was our love of literature an affectat ion, which has now dropped off like a mask?' \" Occ asionally he had been shown a fragment of some work in progre ss-which was always torn up before completion. Then very near the end, Katherine Mansfield sent fo r her old editor and confided to him a revelatory insight: she had discovered that a new approach to literature was possible. In his account, Orage is careful not to use Gurd jieff' s terminology; but it obviously underlies the whole essay , and it was almost certainly in the language of the System that Katherine M ansfield expressed her aspirati ons. Her fo rmer attitude to writing had been the mechanical reaction of certain ''I's.'' Now she proposed something new. r m aware . . . of a recent change of attitude in mysel f: and at once not only my oid storie s have come to look different to me, but lif e itself looks different. I could not write my oid stories again, or any more like them: and not becau se I do not see the same detail as before, but because somehow or other the pattern is different. The old details now make another pattern; and this perception of a new pattern is what I call a creative attitude towards life. She had reached a certain stage in the process-and suddenly new meanings had fa llen into place like the tumblers in a lock. There were other ways of dividing up the world . The details of how she proposed to apply her new discovery are not encouraging; she wanted, fo r example, to use the subtlety with which she had previously poked fu n at human fai lings to depict a hero and heroine overtopping each other's bids in a conte st of love . But the nature of her insight is much more impor tant than its con­ sequence s. She had integrated the newf ound faith of which she had written to Middleton Murry with the intellectual demands of her prof ession; and at last head and heart were acting in concert. It is difficult to see how the French critic who accu sed Gurd jieff of making Katherine Mansfield \"die badly\" can have been fa miliar with the evidence. She had arrived at Fontainebleau in a state of terror and depression. A week before her death Gurd jieff's alche my had turned this into a sense of purpose and near tranquillity. In VIew of what she so clearly sensed about her physical condition, complete tranquillity was impossible; and it was her body-ab out which Gurd jieff could do nothing -wh ich failed her. Middleton Mur ry arrived at the Institute on the afte rnoon of January 9, \"Before I had time to kiss her, \" he wrote later, \"the thought passed through my head: somet hing has happened. By that 'something' I meant som ething decisive in the spiritual struggle in which she had been engag ed. She had"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF MAN 253 changed prof oundly in the three months since I had seen her; she seemed unearth ly, and I had never seen anyone more lovely than she appeared to me that da y.\" K. M. told him that although she had gained fr om her experience, she did not know whether she would stay much longer at Fonta inebleau. \"But she had not, she said, really made up her mind about M. Gurd jiefI. \" The couple made plans to live together in a country cottage, and during the afternoon and evening Katherine Ma nsfield led Mu rry round to inspect the work in progr ess, to meet her fr iends, and to take a hand in painting the Study House. After supper some of the pupils assembled in the salon fo r the nightly session of exerc ises. Acco rding to Olgivanna, K. M. was withdrawn and nervous, hoping rather desperately that the dancers would perform Gurd jieff's \"The Initiation of the Priestess\"- fr om which she alway s seemed to derive energy and exalta tion. HalfWay through this movement Gurd jieff stopped the dancers and ordered them back to the Study House. K. M. left the salon to go to bed. As sh e climbed the stairs , fo llowed by Mur ry, a coughing fit began; in her room it became clear that she had had a hemorr hage . Blood gushed fr om her mouth, and the doctors g�thered around; but by 10:30 that night, she was dead. Mu rry's fe elings ab out GurdjiefI remained for a long time very mixed, but at the end of his own lif e, he permitted himself a definite state ment. He refused to judge the Institute. \"But I am persuaded of this ,\" he wr ote: \"that Katherine made of it an instrument fo r that proce ss of self -annihilation which is necessary to the spiritual rebirth , whereby we enter the Kingdom of Love . I am certain that she achieved her purpose, and that the Institute lent itself to it. More I dare not, and less I must not sa y.\" Murry did appoint . himself the hagiographer of his dead wif e, and this must be taken into acc ount when considering his verdict. But K. M.' s adventure at Fon­ tainebleau seems to have left her a being who, if she had lived, would have been a ship refitted fo r new voyages rather than a leaking tub sailing under ragged canvas . As Olgivanna wrote, she had destroyed the world in which she had lived and in which she no longer believed. She had built another one-wh ere there was still a place both for literature and fo r her love fo r Murry. If she had lived ... and surely that is the criteri on? She left the world of the Institute in a plain coffin, but even if she had known the inevi table fo rm of her journey out, would not the journey in have bee n the only thing to do? Those who believe in the \"other side\" would scarcel y deny her trumpets.

On the nineteenth, Ouspensky, described as \"a middle-aged, much travelled and learned Russian\" and \"the chief missi onary fo r Gurd jieff's acade my, \" was interviewed in London. He struck an emine ntly sober note. \"I don't like to see the word 'cult' applied to the movem ent,\" he said. \"We are not trying to fo und a church or sect, but simply to promote a method of education and study .\" Ouspensky was at pains to emphasize that the manual labor described at Fountainebleau had \"nothing to do with a Tolstoyan love of work fo r work's sake .\" It was \"merely one-often a brief -stage in the education of the student .\" The Daily News published a half -page of photographs of pupils at the Institute engaged in dancing, sewing, cooking and building the Study House. Discussion invaded the corre spondence columns. An anonymous article took issue with Gurd jieff's procla imed intention of divesting the pupil of his personality and liberating his essence. The writer compared Gurd jieff's \"essence\" to the subconscious of psychoanaly sis, and noted that not the \"essen ce\" but the '''personality '' was the repository of all civilized value s. \"Would it be unfair to ask Mr. Gurdjieff bluntly whether de­ socialisation of the individual is the aim of his system of training?\" Why, this critic asked, had the \"essence\" been \"thrust below the surface\" in the evolutionary proce ss? \"Ev ery scientific inquirer- into the nature of the subconscious has been impressed above all else by the strength of its primitive desires. If wisdom, insight and even genius also reside there, it is in association with these powerful fo rces.\" The writer argued that this accounted fo r the failure of previous atte mpts to mobilize the unconscious, and he ended his article on a note of war ning. He did not suggest that Gurd jieff was unaware of the dangers conf ronting him. He and his colleagues appeared to be \"able and honest men.

D. Beresf ord and J. W. N. Sullivan appeared disso ciating themselves fr om Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. Sullivan pronounced himself unsy mpathetic to Gurd jieff's aims and possessing \"not the faintest intention of fo rming any connection with his Institute .\" Bere sford fo llowed up his own letter with an acco unt of why he had withdrawn fr om Ouspensky's lectures the previous autumn. Bere sford acco mpanied Kat herine Mansfield to Ouspensky's lectures and took part in discussions with her and Orage about the Fourth Way . He describes how he explained th e principles of the Fourth Way to Millar Dunning, the yogi from Ditc hling. Dunning listened with interest, then \"without gesture or emphasis\" informed the novelist that the Fourth Way might \"produce the result desired; but that it was evil. He then went on to say that the succe ssful fo llowe rs of this road were those spoken of in Christ's parable as coming to the wedding of the King's Son without a wedding garment-the mystical garment of love .\" * Bere sford admits that this statement might not impress many readers as one of great significance ; but fo r him, it came \"with a sense of revelati on,\" and he began to fe el that the teach ing was \"repugnant\" to him. The central point of Beresf ord's article in the Daily News was a warn ing that the soul without the wedding garm ent would \"suffer in the herea fter. \" He made a distinction between occultism-as represented by Gurd jieff and Ouspensky -and mysticism­ whose representative fo r him was Dunning. Later he contrasted \"personal and impersonal methods\" and admitted that \"in my own mind they have much the same connotation as Black and White Mag ic. \" ' Meanwh ile the Fontainebleau Institute exerci sed an undiminished fa s­ cinat ion.

Like the Daily News reporter, he denied that the Institute bore any relati onship to the various \"experimental colonies\" with which his readers were familiar. The only comparison that could be made was with the community established by Pythagoras at Samos in 500 B.C. Sharp had been completely carried away by Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. His wife and many of his fr iends were at Fontainebleau , and the comparison With Pythagoras most probably originated with Orage . He himself had • Beresf ord does not name his friend, the \"poet and mystic .\" For some time, I thought that this was A. E. Waite, whom J. C.

Bevan (1870-1943) was a fo rmer head of the British School of Archeology in Athens, who at the time was lecturing at King's College, Lond on. During the early 1930s, he twice delivered the Giff ord Lectures and the spiritual prob lems which had so exercised Sharp's hero, William James-another Giff ord Lecturer-were by no mea ns fo reign to him. If Gurd jieff's teach ing proved its worth, he argued, it would \"stand or fa ll on its own merits, like any other scientific theor y.\" But, \"the introduction of this 'esoteric tradition' business\" aroused his suspicions. \"It has been associated in the past with so much humbug .\" There was no evidence that Gurd jieff possessed any knowledge with which orthodox scientists or scholars were unfaIpiliar. \"No doubt a supposed origin in a secret Oriental tradition tends to secure a much wider popularity in certain circles fo r any teac hing,\" Bevan wrote ; and he pounced on the very difficulty which Gurd jieff later admitted had spoiled his work : \"popularity with just the wrong kind of people-the people whose adherence is not a recomm endation . \" In a second article, published on March 17, Sharp made no reply, but instead summa rized Ouspensky's teaching and invited those who were interested to go to Fontainebleau and find out more fo r themselve s. It was a valiant attempt to beat the drum fo r the Inst itute fo r the Harmonious Development of Man; and Sharp clearly recognized that Gurd jieff's teaching might have a mass appe al-to those literally or metaphorical ly shellshocked, whom Middleton Mur ry had described as \"maimed\" by the experience of war . Ouspensky had emerged fr om the Eur opean holocaust with a teaching which had appar ently sustained him in the eye of the hurrica ne, and Sharp placed particular emphasis on his explanation of war as the necessary consequence of man's unconscious state .

However, I tried to reassure myself with the thought that we were all 'mac hines', and that one machine is as good as another so fa r as 'm echanical' l if e is conce rned.

Gurdjieff decided to buy a car . There was a certain subdued excite­ ment about this fo r many, probably because unconsciously it stood fo r the inclusion of something human and commonp lace in a world which was rap idly becoming inhuman and outside real ity. It was understood that Gurd jieff had never bef ore driven a car, which was probably true . It was believed by many, including presumably intelligent English women, that Gurdjieff would not have to learn to drive in the ordinary way . He would be able to drive , so to speak, by inspir ation .. .. When there was a ghastly noise suggestive of tearing of gear-wheel cogs , the faithful insisted that it was a test of fa ith fo r sceptics such as myse lf. . . . I soon discovered that it was impossible to cope with such sophis try � :\"win�to-believe .\" ... I could not but be impressed by the power �ich accr ues to a man once he has been invested with the magical attributes of the \"all-powerful fa ther\" or has had the \"magician\" archetype pro jected into him, as Jung would say. People in the grip of such a transf erence are oblivious to criticism .... .. Another exa mple: the parents of an imbecile child got it into their h eads that Gurdjieff might be able to help this child in some mysterio us way, and brought it all the way from England. It had an attack of diarrhoea soon after arrival, probably due to change of diet. In this case I was really astonished to find that people who might have kn own better said that Gurdjieff had begun to \"work\" on him. They meant that by some mysterious means best known to himself he had p roduced the diarrhoea. Young's skepticism provoked accu sations of spiritual pride from his fe llow � pils, and the doctor confided his disillusionment to a friend , \"a man of"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"258 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE lett ers,\" who occas ionally came to stay at Fonta inebleau . This was almost certainly Bechhofer Roberts . Their correspondence confirmed Young's suspicions of the Institute . Bechh ofer was clearly influenced by the warnings of Dunning and Bere sford but fe lt that 'the place is real.\" He thought that Gurdjieff was probably able to teach methods of self ­ develo pment, but only to those who wo uld cooperate with his personal plans . After awhUe he became seriously alarm ed. \"In my own mind lies no longer any fa intest doubt about Gurdjieff and his Institute . Signs of hoof s and horns are all over the place , and my deep and instant distrust, which increased with every day I spent there finds confirmation whenever I return ... \" A specific incident was needed to catalyze Young's decision to leave Fontai nebleau . A woman member of the Institute was taken ill and , according to Young's observation, vomited blo od. Yo ung . diagnosed an intestinal ulce r. Gurd jieff denied that the woman had vomited blood at all and produced, in Bechhof er's wor ds, \"quite a diff erent diagnosis\"-his reticence m ight conceal every sort of obscenity or irrelevancy. Shortly afterwar� an operation in London proved that Young was right. When the doctor taxed Gurdjieff with the aff air, he was upbraided fo r lack of trust; and Orage, with whom Young shared a room, maintained that it had merely been another test. Young could take no more and left at once . This seems to be an open and shut case . Even if Gurdjieff had intended his remarks to Young as a \"tes t, \" he must have realized that in the climate which he had deliberately created such a gambit might substantially decrease the sick woman's chances of a cure . But soon after Young's dep�re, Maurice Nicoll noted in his diary: \"Jimmy has left. G. gave lecture on importance of rememberi ng . that we came here with a definite obj ect . . .\" This lecture was delivered on August 21, 1923, and it answers almost all Young's ob jections to the life at Fonta inebleau . Gurdjieff began by attacking one secti on of his pupils-those who had fo rgotten why they ca me, They were supposed to be at the Institute to \"work on themselves\" and they were supposed to have come because they realized that ordinary life could not provide the special conditions nec essa ry for such work. But once at the Institute they fo rgot all their resolutions and refused to see that Gurdjieff was actually creating the necessary conditions around them. Gurdjieff proposed that pupils unable to make use of this opportunity leave at once and stop wasting his time.

It didn't matter, he explained­ answering James Young's as yet unvoiced objections to the \"mechanically­ twittering\" ladies-who was mad, who was clever, who was a decent sort, and who a bounder. If they were tempted to think that their fellow pupils were a collection of fools, Gurdjieff told his audience, this was because the Institute existed to create the sort of conditions which would expose the worst sides of people , principally so that a pupil would see his defects for himself. When someone came to Fontainebleau, he left a world which acc epted a man's valuation of himself. No wonder, when he first found himself in an atmosphere which encouraged a deeper examination of human behavior, he imagined that he was locked up with a band of rogues and idiots. Gurdjieff ended by saying that the Institute, instead of being a corrective to everyday life, had turned into something worse than everyday life. His pupils were occupied with scandalmongering, judging others, \"consider­ ing,\" and forming diques. In fact-although he did not say this-his Institute had become like institutes the world over. Thus, the case of Dr. Young is not entirely open-and -shut. It still demanded a large amount of trust from a medical practitioner to assume that Gurdjieff's medical knowledge was as great as his own. -But it could well have been that the lesson Gurdjieffwas trying to teach was that You should assert himself more-rely on his professional competence when he knew himself to be right. There remains an element of doubt; but the evidence is weighted on Gurdjieff's side. It was not necessarily Young's diagnosis with which he took issue, but with the doctor's own psychology. �. !fhe fact is that, whatever Gurdjieff said, the sick woman was operated upon, and his pronounc ement did not prevent her from having medical treatment. It may have delayed treatment; in which case Gurdjieff is certainly to be blamed-but, as he told his pupils, they were supposed to take no account of his expressed opinions except as a stimulus to their psycholOgical work. The trouble was, as he himself recognized, that he was naturally a figure who inspired uncritical obedience and attracted to himself people in search of a pair of shoulders broad enough to carry their burdens . . Young admits that he was not completely free from the hypnotic trance in which many of Gurdjieff's pupils lived. His search for a Master did not end with his leaVing Gurdjieff, and for a time, he was closely connected with Dmitrije Mitrinovic. He became Middleton Murry's closest friend, and for the rest of his life practiced as an eclectic psychiatrist in London .

CASE: A.R. Orage . PROBLE MS: as stated in previous files. When Orage arrived at the Prieure with Alice in Wonderland in his pocke t, he fo und that, far from disappearing down magical rabbit holes, he was expected to dig them. Gurd jieff fo rbade him to smoke which, he said, \"almost killed\" him. \"I was told to dig, \" he told C. S. Nott, \"and as 1 had had no real exercise fo r years I suff ered so much physically that I would go back to my room, a sort of cell, and liter ally cry with fa tigue. No one, not even Gurdji eff, came near me. 1 asked myse lf, 'Is this what I have given up my whole life fo r? At least 1 had something then. Now what have I?'\" The Daily News correspondent contrasted the corduroys and call oused hands of this new Orage with the elegant Bohemian of the Cafe Royal . Denis Saurat, who came to see his friend on February 17, 1923, was amazed by the physical change he fo und. \"I used to know him when he was almost fa t,\" he wrote, \"when his tall, bony frame supported a body of some 85 kilos weight. But to meet me came a thin, almost emaciat ed Orage with a troubled face. Seem ingly a taller Orage , whose movements were quicker and stronger; in better health , but unhap py.\" In early 1923, puzzle ment seems still to have been Orage's prevailing emotion. He was resolute enough to give the Daily News corre spondent an acco unt of what he believed to be Gurd jieff' s objectives, but hinted that he had become a member of the Institute more out of hope than from any definite expectat ion. \"There are men in London who are already as 'clever' as it is possible to be fo r men under ordinar y condition s,\" he told Bowyer, \"and who are asking themselves whether this is the ultima thule-wh ether they have reached the final limits of their evoluti on.

On the night of the Frenchman's arrival, Gurd jieff sent him a bottle of vodka to share with Orage and the other English. No one wanted the vodka, but because the pupils were scared of Gurd jieff, they refused to let Saurat tip half the bottle out of the window, and instead, fo rced the spirit down their reluctant throa ts. \"All these people were disconcert ed,\" Saurat recalled, \"prey to a mixture of shame, fe ar and inarticulate hope .\" Saurat had an interview with Gurd jieff, after which he repeated to his fr iends the Master's admission that the Seekers fo r Truth had made some of their discoveries in books. This irritated the English pupils. One of the doctors wondered what they were all doing at Fontainebleau if the tradition was to be fo und in books . Another Englishman suspected that perhaps there was no secret tradition after all. They were all very struck by Gurd jieff' ,s admission that \"there was something sinister\" about the Prieure .' \"They wondered a little whether they were dup es,\" reported Saurat, \"but they still pref erred to be victims. Howev er, they were afraid of being exploited by Gurd jieff fo r his occult ends .\" Depressed, confused, and suspicious Orage may have been, but he still believed sufficiently in Gurd jieff's ideas to resent a joke at the ir expense. Saurat confided in a reporter that he was a prof essor at the University of Bordeaux and could assure him that all the inmates of the Institute were mad. The journalist repeated this to Orage , who took ten years to fo rgive Saurat his act of betrayal . And Orage's commitment was in no dottbt to Middleton Mu rry when he had to refuse the editor's offer of the New Age . Mu rry saw the older man as reduced to esse ntia ls. \"It seemed to me, \" he wr ote, \"that a very fine simplicity had descended upon his complex ;n;ature ... \" The period of uncertainty and despair must have lasted at least fo r Drage 's first fo ur or five months at the Prieure. Then he made a breakthr ough. \"When I was in the very depths of despair,\" he told Nott, \"feeling that I could go on no longer, I vowed to make extra effort, and just ,�n something changed in me.

But"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE underneath the prof essional relationship between the two men grew up a certain camaraderie, app arently based on Gurd jieff's side upon a genuine fe eling of friendship. One result was that Orage-who se mind could gallop where Gurd jieff's could merely canter-soon held something of a priv­ ileged poSition at the court of Fontainebleau . During the later 1920s he was even known to exploit this at Gurd jieff's expen se. \"You know, Orag e,\" Gurdjieff would say port entously, \"oranges grow on tre es .\" \"Do they really?\" Orage would drawl . \"I thought they came from box es .\" From under their simian brow ridge , Gurd jieff 's eyes would look mom entarily puzzled; had the favorite son really been so stupid? By what stage s Orage progr essed from a relation ship of awed obedience to one of banter, we cannot know; but the first steps in his future intima cy with his teache r must have been taken during the spring and summer of 1923. Orage was certainly among the most able of Gurdjieff 's pupils in a conventional sense, and his skill as a propaga ndist was to prove invaluab le. When Gurdjieff selected him to acco mpany Dr. Stoerne val-his oldest fo llower-to the United Stat es, he was , in fa ct, the obvious choice as ambassador. He set sail fo r New York in the autumn of 1923 to edit souls . America had begun to appear to Gurdjieff as a necessary step fo r two related re asons . The first was financial . Although most of the cost of buying ,and refurbishing the Prieure had been met by Ouspensky's pupils, Gurdjieff was still faced with a considerable financial burden. According to the Daily News, the general rate fo r a pupil at the Institute was seventeen pounds ten shillings per month, although visitors who stayed in relative luxury in \"the Ritz\" or came simply to be cured by Gurdjieff of various ailments , might be charged as much as forty or fifty pounds . But the ma jority of Gurd jieff's pupils, though comf ortably off, were not rich, and well over half the total complement of the Prieure were Russians who relied entirely on the Master's charity. Into the barga in, since the Prieure had become his home, Gurd jieff had sent fo r his fa mily from Georgia, and they arrived in the summer of 1923 to increase the number of his depend ents . To supplement his inc ome, Gurdjieff had resumed his prof ession of \"physician-hypnotist\" and spent considerable time in Paris-where he established an \"office\" in the Caf e de la Paix- ptying his trade fo r the benefit of drug addicts and alcoholics . At the same time he undertook various business ac tiviti es, including a profitable deal in oil shares and the establishment and sale of two restaurants in Montmartre . Toge ther with the organization of the Institute and the demands of the pupils who arrived the re, it is not surprising that all this activity wore him down. In \"The Material Question ,\" Gurdjieff writes that his health began to concern him, and he realized that he would have to take a rest. He had"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"INSTITUTE FOR HARMONIOUS DEVEL OPMEN T OF MAN 263 been planning a trip to the United States in the more distant future; but he now decided that if he made the expedition sooner, it could serve the dual purpose of fund raising and holiday. \"I was beginning to hope,\" he writ es, ' \"that my pupils would now be capable of organizing various lectures and demonstrations in America by themselves .\" As a dress rehearsal for his transatlantic venture , Gurdjieff decided to risk his remaining capital on a series of demonst rations in Paris over the Christmas season of 1923. These were organized through Alexander de Salzmann's acquaintance with Jacques Hebertot, the director of the TheAtre des Champs-Elysees, where the perf ormances took place irregularly between December thirteenth and twenty-fifth. Expansive as always, Gurdjieff had the small fountains in the foyer run with red and white wine. \"The Art of the Antique Orient Revived ,\" proclaimed the Echo des Champs Elysees , and promised further revelations from \"the mysterious heart of Asia\" in seasons to come. For the moment, the publicity announced, the Institute for the Harmonious Develop ment of Man was confining itself to three programs: a demon stration of movement, a program of music performed on Gurdjieff's collection of Oriental instrum ents, and an exhibition of \"religious phenomena, consisting of tricks, half-tricks and real phenomena observed in religious ceremonies of the ancient East.\" The \"tricks\" of which the advertis ement spoke were conjuring tricks of the sort performed by stage illusionists , and Gurdjieff had already used them to enliven his Saturday night demonstrations in the Study House. Apparently the members of the Institute were proficient conjurer s-as anyone must be who is interested in \"psychical phenom ena.\" It is unclear what Gurdjieff W ,�ant by \"half-tricks\"; and the \"real phenomen a\"-sustained exercises in � direction of consciou sness-were not obvious to the general public. \\ The demonstrations of movement created great interest. Gurdjieff's program included the \"Stop\" exercis e, \"The Initiation of the Priestess,\" and gymnastic exercises said to derive from a \"school called 'The Seers'\" which ' � \"existed from antiquity in large artificial caverns in Kafiristan, on the i!ieights of Kijera.\" There were \"movements\" from monastic orders in �hlnese Turkestan , Kafiristan , Tibet, Caucasia, and Kashgar; \"work­ ' a\"an ces,\" prayers and fragments of ritual. The program concluded with an :i � called Pythia described as \"part of a ceremony like that M.

Europe was a cloud on the horizon of Washington Square. It was the age of the great Atlantic liners, symbolizing the proximity of Europe to the United States: Jean Toomer, who became a leading exponent of Gurdjieff's ideas, wrote an abortive novel called Transatlantic set on such a ship. It was the age of prohibition, when, \"if you point your fourth finger,\" wrote Gurdjieff , \"and covering one half of your mouth with your right palm, utter the name of any liquid you fancy, then, immediately and without more words, that liqUid. is served at table-only in a bottle purporting to be lemonade or the famous French Vichy .\" It was the age of jazz, and of Gurdjieff's phobia, the foxtrot.

In the late 1920s , an extraordinary underground influence was exercised by Orage's teaching of Gurd jietI's ide as. Although psychoanalysis was a more enduring movement, in Orag e's New York heyday the revelations of Prof essor Freud were no match fo r his captivating cha rm. The ground fo r Orage 's mission had been prepared by Claude Bragdo n's , publication of Tertium Organim . On its publication in 1920, Tertium Organum sold so well that Bragdon had to turn over the list of his Manas Press to Alfred Knopf fo r fe ar that his other activitif'S would be swamped by his spare time publishi ng. Meanwhile through Ouspensky's \"Letters fr om Russia\" in the New Age, he made contact with Orage, who replied that he himself had lost touch with Ouspensky after his flight from Ekaterinodar . Eventually an American devotee of Tertium Organum called at the London headquarters of the Theosophical Society, where a friend of Ouspensky told him that Ouspensky was in Constantinop le. Bragdon was able to open communications and to send Ouspensky a check fo r royal ties. It rapidly became known among the devotees of Ouspensky's book that the author was associated with Gu rdj ietI . The vag ueness of most people about this association is illustrated by Bragdon's reaction when he heard from Orage-with whom he had corresponded sin \"be his first inquiry about Ouspens ky-that Gurd jietI was arriving in the United Stat es. Orage wrote from Fontainebleau, on November 26, 1923: I expect to be sailing fo r New York on Dec. 15 to spend a few weeks in preparing the way fo r Mr. Gurd jietI's visit in January (you know of course all about Mr. Gurd jietI and Mr. Ouspensky) . Naturally I look"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"A CRACK IN THE TIMES 267 fo rward to meeting you, and, in fact, I should come with even more timidity if I did not expect to find you there . Bragdon wrote later, in his autobiograph y, The Secret Springs, \"Although I knew nothing of Gurd jieff and his Institute , I did know of Ouspensky's connection with it in some capacity or other, and that by my publication of Tertium Organum I stood more or less committed to its general philosophy . Nevertheless something deep within me demurred, and so I did not take any actio n, even to the extent of meeting Orage at the dock as he had suggested .\" However, as soon as Orage landed, he came to see Bragdon and spent \"several hours\" trying unsuccessfully to persuade him to support Gurd jieff's demonstrations in New York . Despite this reverse, Orage and Stoerneval managed to excite some interest among intellectuals and the press. The program of Gurd jieff's displays was an expanded version of that given in France . The first demonstration was held on January 23, 1924 in a ballroom known as Leslie Hall at 260 West 83rd Street, and was fo llowed by other perf ormances at the Lenox Theatre (end of January), the Neighbor- . hood Playhouse in Greenwich Village , and a grand demonst ration at Carnegie Hall on February 9. There may also have been other perf or­ mances in the Astor Hotel and a \"Webster Hal l.\" Orage then left to prepare the way fo r demonstrations in Boston and Philadelphia, and Gur dj ieff followed with his pupils. They perf ormed in Chicago and returned to New York fo r a final demonstration at Carnegie Hall on March 3. The demonstrations were the sensation of the hour. Reports varied from the partisan article by Maud Hoffmann which appeared in the New York Times of February 10, to the most extravagant sensationa lism. The Bookman occ upied the middle gr ound: We were very much puzzled and a little impressed by sacred temple dance s, ritual movements, dervish dance s, etc. While the dancers exhibited great muscular control, the music oppressed us and the movements themselves seemed jerky and utterly lacking in grace . How ever, many other persons seemed moved, and the audience . represented widely diverse intere sts. In the large and darkened hall one caught glimpses of Theodore Dreiser, Fannie Hurst, John O'Hara Cosgrave, Gloria Swanson, Rebecca West, Elinor Wylie, Mrs. Thomas Lamont, young Alan Rinehart, etc. , etc. How important such a movement can be we are not capable of judging.

The American Weekly carried a story under the head line: \" DR. \" GURDJIEFF AND HIS MAGICAL SECRET OF LIFE-HOW TO BE A SUPER-MAN OR SUPER-WOMAN BY FEEDING PIGS, DANCING WEIRD DANCES ALL NIGHT AND OTHER FANTASTIC ANTIC S. The journalist's climax was an account of how in the evenings at Fontainebleau \"scores of patients of the asylum-institute- eddy out like gentle gho sts at twilig ht.\" To the strains of mus io-- \"exotic, sensuous, mystical, provoca­ tive\"-played by hidden musicians, Gurdjieff apparently gave commands from within his curtai ned booth in the Study House, \"'Dance !' he cries from behind the curtain. 'Da nce as your souls dictate ! Dance-dance­ dance to freed om!' \" The journalist William Seabrook attended the demons trations out of a fa scination with matters mystical and occul t. He was mildly interested in the conj uring parts of the program , although he fo und them little different from the fe ats perf ormed by Houdini, who clai med no superna tural pow ers. But he was deeply impressed by Gurd jieff hims elf, whom he met the night after his arrival and engaged in an all-night conversat ion. \"Whether his power lay simply in the fields of hypnotis m and autosugge stion, or went beyond it into authentic telepathy and clairvoyance ,\" Seabrook mused, \"or even further into the Tibetan and Yoga fi elds of alleged occult miracle­ working, I never became convince d-fo r the reason that I've never yet become convinced that power in these latter cate gorie s can exist at all. But whate ver category Gurd jieff's power may have lain in-in those days he had pow er.\" Seabrook was disconcerted by the �iscipline of Gurd jieff's pupils. \"They were like a group of perf ectly trained zombies, or like circus animals jum ping through hoops ringed with fire, or like the soldiers of Christophe who marched without breaking step off the parapet of the citadel on that sheer mountainside in Haiti. \" The most spectacular demons tration of Gurd jieff's authority was a breathtaki ng variation on the \"Stop\" exerc ise: The troupe was deployed extre me back stage , facing the audience .

When they presently arose, by his permission, and it was evident that no arms, legs, or necks had been broken-no one seemed to have suff ered even so much as a scratch or bruis e-there were storms of applau se, mingled with a little prote st. It had been almost too much. The vision of the Master as a Man of Power, which had proved so attractive in Russia, left in the United States an impression of mild distaste. The British writer, Llewellyn Powy s, visited the Neighborhood Playho use and observed Gurd jieff : \"His general appearance made one think of a riding- master, though there was something about his presence that affected one's nerves in a strange way . Especially did one fe el this when his pupils came on to the stage , to perform like a hutchful of hypnotized rabbits under the gaze of a master conj uror .\" Claude Bragdon approved wholeheartedly of Powys' imagery, and agreed that there was \"som ething disturbing\" about Gurd jieff . \"He impressed me as a man of pow er,\" he wrot e, \"but at the same time I was a little repelled; I did not want to be drawn into that particular net. \" The actor, Walter Hampden, was even more outspoken. He had atte nded a late night session of questions and answers conducted by Gurd jieff, and remarked afterward to Brag don: \"Claude, no one need tell me that this man is a Master. The mark of a Master is mastery, and Gurdjieff cannot even m ake himself underst ood-no Master would come here so unprepared as tha t.\" The demonst rations did serve a purpose, although not that of raising funds. The last perf ormance at Carnegie Hall was the only occas ion on which seats were sold, and this was not a financial succ ess. But the irritating ques tions posed by Gurd jieff himself had been enlarged by the unfamiliar quality of his music and the move ments. And in New York-as earlier in Russia and London-the Work split into two parts. There was the puzzling figure of the Master hims elf, the source of knowledge and the creator of confus ion; the glyph incarnate , a living parable . And there was the reasonable voice of Orage to explain the inexplicabl e. To one recalcitrant pupil who objected that Gurd jieff would not answer her questions, he once burst out: \"Can't you just watch him?\" , To supplement Gurd jieff's teac hing there alway s emerged explica tors, who repeated what they themselves had unders tood-p erhaps what they had gleaned from Gurd jieff's hints and chance droppings of advice or remembered fr om talks he had. given when it had suited him to teach explicitly .

The responsibilities which he had assumed of necessity were to hang like an albatross around his neck for the next seven years. The view from outside-of the mission of Orage and Gurdjieff, of the sensation caused by the dance s, of the subsidence of a nine days' wonder ­ is again quite different from the internal landscape which the two men really inhabited. They stepped through a crack in the times. During the decade which separated the end of the First World War from the stock market crash of October 1929, American intellectuals tried uneasily to find a compromise with the disturbingly successful philistines riding the business boom. In an article written in March 1932, from the far side of the Depression, Edmund Wilson analyzed the \"superficial\" nature of such intellectual attitudinizing: We can see now that they all represented attempts on the part of the more thoughtful Americans to reconcile themselves to a world domi­ nated by salesmen and brokers-and that they all involved compro­ mises with the salesman and the broker. Mencken and Nathan laughed at the broker, but they got along with him very well, provided he enjoyed George Moore and had pretensions to a taste in liquor; . . . the poets and philosophers hid from him-and the physicists grew more and more mystical in the laboratories subsidized mainly by the profits from industrial investments ; the humanists, in volume after volume, endeavoured by sheer hollow thunder to induce people to find in the stock exchange the harmony and dignity of the Parthenon. Wilson later reprinted this article as part of a longer piece on 'The Literary Consequences of the Crash\" in which he associated the success of Gurdjieff and Orage with the schizophrenic climate he describe d. But the \"more thoughtful\" Americans whom he pilloried as unhappily straddling the gulf between Fantasy and Mammon must sometimes have been conscious of the precariousness of their stance. It was unsatisfying, it was compro mised from the points of view both of culture and of cash, and it provided no real solution to what Gorham Munson was to call \"the dilemma of the liberated.\" In the book which Munson published under that title in 1930, he summarized the problem confronting a generation which had lost faith in its early enthusiasms and was discontented with superficial rebellion. 'The intelligent modem man feels liberated from petty social convention s, narrow theological views, discredited authorities, the grosser popular superstiti ons, but liberated for what? Only, it seems, to face a dar kened problem of choices, with many strong reasons for distrusting every alternative offered.\""},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"A CRACK IN THE TIMES 271 The appeal of a theory which seemed to advocate harmony and integration -wh ich pointed the way toward some ultimate synthesis- was strong. The New World was still in the process of establishing a solid identity vis-a-vis the Old; and despite the birth pangs of a new literature, it had scarcely begun to compete in the cultural field. It appeared to some intellectual s-an d Orage fo stered this beli ef-that the next step might prove to be the Gurdjieff Method; that in some way, there was a specifically American mission to adopt the strange discipline which Gurd jieff advocated and bring it to an unimaginable fruition . Conditions fo r Orage 's success in New York were similar to those which had fa vored Ouspensky in London. Within a general climate of opinion, there were particular groups whose own search fo r values had approached the point at which they might rise to the bait thrown out by the Master and the steady fishing of his disciple . The three most aff ected were the literary group which in 1923 was more or less under the influence of Waldo Frank; the circle of writers and publicists centered on Herbert Croly and the New Republic; and the staff of the avant­ garde The Little Review, edited by Ma rgaret Anderson and Jane Heap. These groups were in close contact-Waldo Frank published in both T he Little Review and the New Republic-and Orage's success cut a broad swathe through the intelligentsia of New York . The Frank circle of 1923 included Hart Crane , Gorham Munson, Jean Toomer, and Kenneth Burke . All were in some way aff ected by Gurdjieff and Orage , although Crane very quickly, and Frank later, rej ected the influence of Fontainebleau and its Master. Waldo Frank (b. 1889) was the literary lion at the time of Gurd jieff's arriv al. He had graduated fr om Yale ,� 1911 and worked in New York as a journalist before taking to the life of a free lance writ er. In 1916 he was one of the founders of the review, The Seven Arts, and soon his novels began to earn him a reputation as a prophet. In France, he was looked upon as the voice of the new American literature and became the American correspondent of the Nouvelle Revue Franfa ise . At the end of 1916, he married Ma rgaret Naumburg, who two year s earlier had fo unded the progre ssive Walden School in New York, wh ere the teac hing was based on the principles of psychoanalysis and the New Educati on. But even at the time of his greatest success as an int erpreter of America to itself and to Europe , Frank was turning toward mystici sm. At Yale he had inves tigated the mystics, Oriental religion, and the new psychology. His marriage increased his interest in the internal world, and at the very time (1919- 20) when his book Our America was en joying a huge · success, Frank was trave ling the country absorbed in the study of medieval Cabali sts. Our America established his reputa tion; and it was the book of a seer of eternal va lues. \"Ours is the first generation of Americans consciously"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE engaged in spiritual pioneer ing,\" he procla imed. His contemporaries were in search of a \"mystic Wor d.\" \"We go fo rth to seek America. And in the seeking we create he r. \" Under this influence of Whitman he declared: \"The one true hier archy of values in the world is the hie rarchy of consciousne ss\"; and implied that his generation was reacting towards a \"fou r-dimensional\" consciousness -an idea he must have derived fr om the books of Claude Brag don. In February 1920, he had a series of visionary experiences in Ric hmond, Virginia, which induced a burst of creative activity resulting in his novels Rahab and City Block-both published in 1922. Some time after his illumination s, Frank read Tertium Organum, and lost no time in passing on his enthusiasm to his fr ie nds. The group adapted catchwords fr om Ouspensky in phrases like \"the new slope of consciousnes s,\" \"the superior logic of metaphor, \" and \"noumenal knowledge \"; Tertium Organum seemed to provide the basis fo r the leap into that American superconscio usness which Frank so hopefully expec ted. It is not clear whether Frank discovered Ouspensky fo r himself, or whether he was directed to Tertium Organum by one of the book's leading propagan dists, the poet Hart Crane . Crane became eloquent over the virtues of Tertium Organum, and-perhaps stimulated by Ouspensky's argu men ts-he too underwent mystical experien ces. In June 1922, he was writing to his fri end, Gorham Mu nson, about his experience of \"the higher conscio usness\" under anaesthetics the previous winter. Mu nson told the poet's biographe r, John Unterecker: \"You can not overemphasize the importance of that book. Crane hounded me to read it. And he kept af ter me to read it until I finally di d. \" Munson himself was born in 1896 and grad uated in 1917 from Wesleyan University . In 1921 he married the dancer Elizabeth Delza. Like his associate s, he made his name in the world of the little magazine s. In the spring of 1922 he fo unded Secession which he published fr om various towns in Austria, Germany, and Italy before returning to the United Stat es, where the last number of his magazine appeared in April 1924. At the time of Gurd jieff's arrival in New York, Munson was Waldo Frank's clo sest fo llower, and in 1923 had published Waldo Frank, a Study, a laudatory essay which he afterward described as \"prem ature \"!\" He was to become one of Or age's right-hand men. . The Amer ican who most fu lly committed himself to Gurdj ieff was another diSCiple of Fra nk, Jean Toomer. Toomer is now remembered only fo r his one published novel, Cane, an account of lif e in the southern United Stat es. Critics of Cane bemoan the fa ct that its always elusive author seemed almost to disappear soon after his impressive debut in the world of let ters.

Until the mid- 1930s, he remained the most important figure after Orage in the teach ing of Gurd jieff's ideas in America. Jean Too mer (18 94-1967) was born Nathan Eugene To omer. Through his mother he derived his ancestry fr om P. B. Pinchback (18 37 -1921), who was briefly Governor of Louisiana in the 1870s. Too mer is thought of as a Negro novelist although, in fa ct, his ancestry also included Welsh, Dutch, French, German, Jewish, and Indian blood. This mixture of so many races of the earth produced in To omer a human being of great attracti veness. Like his mentor Orage , he seems to have fo und his path strewn with willing conqu ests, although his graceful physical type was at the opposite pole to the angular Englishman. Like Orage too-like almost all men of impressive persona lity-he provoked opposition . In the unpublished book \"From Exile into Bein g,\" which To omer began in 1938, he analy zes the reasons why he entered the Work. The metaphor which governs his accou nt is one which Gurd jieff took fr om Buddhist imagery. Lif e consists, he said, of two rivers in one or another of which a man belongs. One of these rivers flows into the common pool of unevolved life fo rce which is distributed throughout newly created beings. The other river flows into the ocean, otherwise the energy source fr om which the water is transf ormed to higher gra des of being. \"A man who has in his common presence his own T enters one of the streams of the river of life; and the man who has not, enters the oth er. \" Too mer sees his progre ss toward Gurd jieff in terms of the drop of water to which Gurd jieff compared the would-be individual trying to move fr om one stream to the other. The ,�econd chapter of \"From Exile into Being\" is entitled \"Un ease in the First \" River. \" Although it was written after a long period spent under the Gurd jieff discipline, the tone of moral earnestness seems to have been charac teristic of To omer at all stages of his lif e. At the age of nineteen, Too mer wrote , he experienced a great \"moral awakenin g. \" What ought he to do? What were the moral imperatives which should govern his lif e? He decided to try to learn scientific agri culture, but neither this nor atte mpts to study law proved successful. He left the universities of New York and Wisconsin because they fai led to provide what he was looking fo r, and only several colleges later did he succeed in recovering a sense of purpose. His unanchored situation was made even more insecure when he was rejected fo r milit ary service in the First World War on grounds of physical fitness. \"So I look ed,\" he wr ote, \"so I tried. I tried this . I tried that. Not this. Not that. I got jobs. I quit jobs. I rej ected and was rej ected .\" He decided that the world was engaged in a conspir acy to pretend that people \"were making the best of an inevitably bad lot\" in order to hide \"the certain knowing that they were misfits and should be"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"274 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE misfits in ' this world-a s-it-is, in this life-as -it-is .\" As he put it in his privately published book, Essentials (1931), \"The open conspiracy : 'Let's do outside things ; inside things are too difficul t. '\" At the end of the war, Toomer \"overnight\" lost his fa ith in God under the influence of scientific and evolutionary thought. But \"a month or so after I lost God I fo und my min d.\" He discovered Whitman and Goethe and began to make contact with American writers, including Lewis Mumf ord and Waldo Frank. At last he had an ob jective, and he began a period of intense work in order to learn to write, although writing alone could not satisfy his hunger fo r fundamenta ls. He began to fe el that \"higher attai nment\" was the goal of existence, and fo r such atta inment a technique was necessary-as literary technique had to be learned, so he must find a teacher of higher consci ousness. Toomer fo und himself \"reading the mystics, the philoso­ phers and religious writers of America and Europe ,\" as well as those modem authors \"whose books were creating a new literature, and indeed a new culture in this lan d. \" The greatest influence on this curriculum was undoubtedly Waldo Fra nk; and Toomer's catalogue makes it clear how the Frank group could see the new literature which they were striving to create as inseparable from an extension of personal consci ousness. Tertium Organum had answered what it was possible to see as a specifically American need. And then there was Cane . Waldo Frank was To omer's literary sponsOl:, and in the last half of 1922 spent some time with his protege in the South, where Toomer in his tum helped Frank with the dialogue and speech rhyth ms of his novel Holiday. The fo llowing year Cane appeared and had an instant critical succ ess. Toomer was not really a natural nove list, and his unpublished works are chiefly remarkable for their psychological insight. When he spreads himsel f, he has a tendency to become turgid and imprecise . Yet his fe eling fo r words is still evident in the book of apho risms, Essentials, which was provoked by his Gurd jieff experience, and compr es­ sion and discipline worked in his fa vor. Cane showed these virtue s, and its impressionistic account of Negro life is vivid, rich as molas ses, and filled with a sense of natural beauty. Although Toomer may have lost his early fa ith, he retained-or had possibly regained -an appreciation of the highly emotional Christianity of the Amer ican South. It wa s on its own merits and not as a result of Waldo Frank's fo reword that Cane earned its succ ess. As a result, its author fo und himself engulf ed in the excitement of the new literary movement. He had arrived. \"To arrive\" meant a great deal in those days of the early '20s .

A number of us, including Gorham Muns on and Hart Crane, came to sense that we were as men with mis sions pioneering up \"the new slope of con­ scious ness. \" Like Crane and Frank, Toomer entered the life beyond life. He went through an extraordinary experience in which he fe lt at one with his people, with all people, with all the world. \"I was in,\" he wrote . \"All I had fo rmerly thought and fe lt about a larger being and a higher consciou sness became fo r me a living reality of higher experience .\" The experience was so intense that it became \"unbeara ble,\" and Too mer was thankful when it departed, leaving \"an unforgettable taste, a burning memory of how it had been when my soul visited me.\" Too mer began to see life as a religiou s proc ess. He rediscovered God, and wondered how he could ever have had the temerity to put pen to paper. \"In my present condition I simply wasn't up to writing.

One day his self -ana lysis reached the point at which he asked the question, \"Who am I?\" At once this \"perf ectly natural . .. but very startling question\" became the center of gravity in his discussions with his friends. The conclusion which he reached was that \"one must become a man bef ore he can bec ome an artist.\" After a succ ession of fa iled atte mpts to persuade his friends to join him in an effort to achieve self -mastery, he decided that the only solution was to seek a master hims elf. He saw \"a trip to Eur ope and to India as the next logical inevitable step.\" But at this point Orage arrived in New York and-miracle of miracle s!-the mountain came to Mohammed sailing in a first clas s cabin on the French Line. The Frank circle was the most obviously \"prepared\" segment of the intellectual world to respond to the messa ge of Orage .

He lost much of his popularity by opposing the signing of the Versailles agree ment. This break with the policy of the Wilson administration cost the New Republic half its circulation and much of its prestige, so that in 1919, Croly fo und himself in a position simi lar to that of Orage in Lond on. Disillusioned with politics , he turned his attention to the prospects of reconc iling religion and science. Edmund Wilson -who was the literary editor of the New Republic and set his face firmly against the influence of Orage and Gurd jieff-refers scathingly to the \"inhibited personality and unsatisfied religious instincts\" which laid Croly open to conv ersi on; long before the advent of Orage , Croly's New Republic articl es had begun to discuss topics of a more or less religious nature, and he had even assemb led the materials fo r a religious book. Orage's approach to similar problems-as a fe llow publicist and literary man-was naturally attrac tive. Other associ­ ate s of Croly were ready for Gurd jieff's ideas. Among these were T.S. Ma tthe ws, son of the Epis copal bishop of Princet on, who was then working on the New Republic and later became editor of Time, and Amos Pinchot, a lawyer and publicist, whose brother Giff ord Pinchot had been a member of Woodrow Wilson's cabi net. Edmund Wilson's critici sm of the vogue fo r Orage occas ionally assumes an embattled tone. There were other groups who came to Gurdjieff chiefly by default. Perhaps their personal idols had crumbled, or they apprehended in a dim way that their gods were substitute s. Perhaps they had been soured by succe ss and had lost their sense of purpose. One such circle was fo rmed by the staff of The Little Review . Essent ially this consisted of the editors, Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, and what ever friends they were able to influence. If in capturing the atte ntion of the Frank circle , Gurdjieff secured a hearing fo r his ideas in America, the fr iends of The Little Review made his name a byword among the studios and studies of cosmopolitan Bohemia. Margaret Anderson fo unded The Little Review in Chicago when she was twenty -five. Born in Indianapolis in 1889, she went to college in Ohio, and escaped from her country club background to work on a magazine in Chicago . There fo llowed a brief career in journalism and a period on the st aff of The Dial before The Little Review burst Jut Athena-like in 1914. From the start the magazine bore the unmi�takable imprint of its originat or's enthusiasm for Art; it was as if the whole fabric of dullness, prud ishness, and rectitude which American artists fe lt encumbering them had been banished by the fo rce of her lone enthusias m.

Ezra Pou nd's good angel, John Quinn, who helped The Little Review financially in New York, thought Jane Heap \"a typical Washingt on-Squ areite ,\" but wrote that Margaret Anderson was \"a damned attractive young woman , one of the han dsomest I have ever seen, very high-spirited, very courageous and very fine.\" The attentions to which she was no doubt subjected simply 1Bcre ased her sense of independence. \"I am no man's wife,\" she thundered in My Thirty Years War, \"no man's delig htful mistress, and I will never, never, never, be a mothe r. \" Her energies were entirely devoted to the lif e of art, which she later defined in Jane Heap's Little Review motto: TO EXPRESS THE EMOTIONS OF LIFE IS TO LIVE TO EXPRESS THE LIFE OF EMOTIONS IS TO MAKE ART. The temperament of its fo under made The Little Review both invaluable and infuriating. Its joie-de-vivre did not exclude a serious purpose, although .in the early numbers that purpose was somewhat in doubt. For a time 'Emma Goldmann and anarch ism pr�)Vided a center of gravi ty, but although :!fhe Little Review always remained sympathetic to the anarchists, its real :6irection was dictated by the fo rceful personality of Jane Heap. More succe ssfully than any of Gurd jieff's fa mous fo llowe rs, Jane Heap contrived to disappear. Once she committed herself to the Work, she made ,a remarkable break with her past life-and became invisible. Academics in"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"278 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE search of information never persuaded her to divulge her personal history, and it is impossible even to discover the exact year of her birth. The date , November 1, was not known until after her death in June 1964, and her age she kept a closely guarded secret. She was probably born around the middle 1880s in Kansas. Both her parents had emig rated from Europe to the United States; her father from Cheshire and her mother fr om Norway . Her grandmother was a Lapp, and that branch of the family had lived three days ' journey beyond the Arctic Circle. \"There were many fa scinating stories of her earl iest life in the Middle West, \" writes one pupil, \"- the hard conditions-the fierce weather-and many unusual experiences of great range and intensit y.\" One particular set of experiences was provoked by her father's job. He was the warden of a lunatic asylu m. In March 1917, Jane Heap published an article in The Little Review describing the loneliness and isolation of her upbringing. \"There were no books to read in this place except the great volumes in the Pat ients' Librar y,\" she wrote ; \"and I had read them all. There was no one to ask about anyt hing. There was no way to make a connection with 'life.' Out there in the world they were worki ng and thinking; here we were still. Very early I had given up every one except the Insane .\" In this stifling and hallucinatory environment, one thing alone supported her: Art. \"Who had made the pictur es, the books and the music in the world? ... And how could you tell the makers from just people? Did they have a light arou nd their heads?\" Then one day a real live Artist visited the United States­ '' 'Sarah Bernhardt .' Even when they said it the name had a light around it!\" The little girl decided to walk all the way to St. Louis where the \"wicked French actre ss\" was appeari ng; but thought better of it, and resol ved: \"Some day I would go to Pari s. Other people had got that far. I would go on living fo r that. \" And then she came again! I was there , the 6rst night, sitting in the balcony with some other art studen ts. We had sold our fu tures to sit so close ... It was only the beginning. Jane Heap succeeded in reac hing Eur ope and she succeeded in making art. The details of her education remain obscure, but she and Margaret Anderson met in Chicago in 1916. \"Jane and I began talking,\" Margaret Anderson wrote. \"We talked fo r days, months, years ... We fo rmed a consolidation that was to make us much loved and even more loath ed. \" Eventua lly Jane was persua ded-m uch against her will-to write fo r The Little Review . The relationship of the two editors was conducted through a volcanic eruption of conversation . \"There is no one in the modern world whose conversation I haven't sampled, I believe ,\" wrote Margaret"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"A CRACK IN THE TIMES 279 Ande.rson in 1930, \"except Picas so's. So I can't say that it isn't better than Jane Heap's. But I doubt it in spite of his reputati on.\" The topic of conversation, of course, was \"Art\"; or rather, the psychology of arti sts. Jane Heap's \"uncanny knowledge of the human composition \" steadily pushed their dissection of the arti st-type toward a study of universa ls. As Margaret Anderson later put it: \"We had never thought of art simply as painting, poetry, music, sculpture. We thought art was an expression , throu gh the arts, of a need fo r something els e.\" To both of them, art had represented an escape from childhood ; now it began to seem a beginning. Jane Heap was far from what would be called a \"happy\" pers on. In Calif ornia during the summer of 1916, she delighted in keeping Margaret Anderson on edge by constant threats of suicide. The next year, when the pair moved The Little Review from Chicago to New York, \"j h\" was plunged into such despair that she spent most of the eighteen hours after their arrival fa ce-down on her bed. But in Margaret Anderson's opinion, it was the state of desperation which gave Jane Heap her drive. This unhappiness was not just a fa shionable Angst about the human conditi on, but had its personal aspects. In the blunt phrase of T. S. Matthews , \"she was the first fu ll-blown Lesbian case I ever sa w. \" Part of her legend lay in her unusu al appearance-in Margaret Anderson's words : \"handsome fe ature s, strongly cut, rather like those of Oscar Wilde in his only beautiful photogra ph. \" For evening dress she would appear in tuxedo, black bow tie, and long black skirt. It was making an eccentric virtue out of necessity ; but even in the early 1920s, the strain must have been excessive, !md was probably responsible fo r the fr ustrations and bursts of spleen fo r � she was noted. Something of this emerges from the pen-portrait of \"jh\" by C. S. Nott, who met her in New York in 1924. She \"had the most . Stiniulating and penetrating mind of any American woman I have ever met, and like all people with strong positive vibrat ions her negative ones were equally strong. She could be quite ruthless and rega rdless of near fr iend or :�ld fo e when she wanted something. She had a strong masculine side; as :she said to me, 'I'm not really a woman .' ... \" Ma rgaret Anderson explains .e deflationary tactics of her friend: \"She never had the sardonic pleasure lin· it that was often attributed to her. She regarded the pricking of the bubbles of self -illusion- helping people to distinguish betw een wish­ fulfilment and reali ty-as essent ial to the race .\" . In New York The Little Review, )Vith its oddly assorted directora te, went from strength to strength.

Matters came to a head in the winter of 1922. Jane Heap complained that artists in the Un ited States had still to make any recognizable impact; fo r Margaret Anderson, it was the last straw. \"For a number of years life had had the aspect of a polar expediti on,\" she wrote, \"-all life serving only to maintain life . It was time to change such an existence . It was time to bring The Little Review to an end.\" Jane Heap ref used to acce pt this decision ; and so Margaret turned the direction of the review over to her co-editor. \"I didn't know what to do about lif e,\" she admitte d, \"-so 1 did a nervous breakdown that lasted many months .\" To one who had always give n thanks fo r her \"una ccountable inner happine ss,\" the experience must have been both pai nful and puzzling. In her autobiographical The Fiery Fountains, she records her transition from a state of supposed euphoria to a confrontation with her \"enemy,\" reality . \"The impression persisted: 'I am so happy, I have always been so desperately happ y.' (As unhappy as . that?) Orage said .\" In 1922 she was conf used and directi onless, her questionings were inchoate , and only by degrees did a positive aspiration take fo rm. An encounter with W. B. Yeats-an early and constant contributor to The Little Revie � ignited a new enthusiasm fo r Europe, and a meeting with Georgette Leblanc, who fo r twenty years had been the mistress and the inspir ation of Maurice Maeterlinck, resulted in a new fri endship th � t stimulated Margaret Anderson's religious instincts. Greenwich Village was discovering French Symb olism fo r itself at about this time, and The Little Review had begun to draw on esoteric sourc es. Margaret Anderson and Georgette Leblanc began to pursue their interr oga­ tion of the cosmos in terms more directly religi ous. They were inspired by the Bible but not to any positive activity; they recoiled in alarm from the terminology of Eastern religi on. But both editors of The Little Review had read Claude Bragdo n's edition of Tertium Organum and considered that \"we had fo und a contemporary author with a great min d. \" They heard a rumor that Ouspensky was writing a book to be called The Unknown Doctrine about his association with Gurdjieff. Th en Gurd jieff's personal emissary arri ved. When Orage landed in New York his task appeared unenviable . As he had fa iled to persuade Claude Bragdon-his only apparently solid \"esoteric\" contact in the city-to lend his support, he was fo rced to fa ll back on his literary reputatio n. He somehow discovered the Sunwise Turn Bookshop at 2 East 31st Street, which is described by Carl Zigros ser as having been \"m uch more than a book shop; it was a clearing house fo r ideas, a meeting"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"A CRACK IN THE TIMES 281 place fo r free spiri ts. \" Its proprietors were a retired English teache r, Madge Jenison, and a retired art teacher, Ma ry Mowbray-Clarke . They published Coomaraswamy's The Dance of Siva, * and ad vertised in The Little Review . \"The shop was animated more by crusaders than commerce, \" writes Zigr osser. \"The sagging financial structure was shored up by taking in a succe ssion of moneyed people as partne rs .\" From this center of the Progre ssive world , Orage made propaganda. It is ironical that at the very outset of his mission in the United States, Orage met the person with whom he was to find the ordinary and important fulfilments of life, and who would eventually prove to be the most important influence in detaching him fr om his Ma ster. Jessie Dwight had bought a share in the Sunwise Turn, and happ ened to hear Orage 's initial lecture on Katherine Mansfield. Next day Orage met her in the shop and asked whether she had enjoyed the talk. According to Philip Mairet, the reply was , \"No, not at all.\" From this promising beginning a fr iendship developed which culminated in Jessie Dwight's becoming, first Orage's secretary, and afterward his wif e. A prospectus fo r the Institute was circulated-a translation of the French original. Margaret Naumburg fo und a copy at the Sunwise Tum, and passed it to Jean Toomer who was intrigued and wanted to examine the doctrine of Ous­ pensky's teacher. His pro jected journey to the East was now unnecessary; equally, it had just begun. \"I began reading it,\" he writes of Gurd jieH\" s prospectu s. 'The first words made me fe el that I was close to what I sought. I read with eag erness. I read with glow . I gave cries of joy as I came upon state ­ ment after state ment that said what I wanted to hear said . Here it was . This was it. At last I had come upon something that 'spoke to my conditi on. '\" Margaret Anderson gives an acc ount of \"Orage's first lecture\" in New York, which seems to ref er to an occas ion which preceded the arrival of Gurd jieff and his pupi ls: Orage walked out upon the stage . He was tall and easy, but quick and sur e-- the most persuasive man I have ever kno wn. He sat down and began to tell, simply, why he had come. Claude Bragdon interrupted by standing up to say that he had a letter fr om Ouspensky which he would like to read . It was a conventional letter, everyone was bored, Bragdon was unaware of boredom as he began commenting on the letter. Orage stopped him expertly and went on with his talk. But the ease and flow of the evening had. been brok en. \"Talk louder ,\" someone called out. \"And be more interest ing,\" Mrs. Lydig said loudly. This *Coomaraswamy became a friend of Orage, although according to Mrs. Jessie Orage, he thought Gurdjielf \"a bit of a charlatan .\""},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"282 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE made me angry. \"Don't do that, \" I whispered to her-\"What's the matter?\" she said, still loudly, \"don't you agree?\"-\"Of course not,\" I said, \"just wait, he'll be so interesting he'll be incomprehensible .\" But he wa sn't. He had no intention of being merely \"interestin g. \" It was the ideas they heard from Orage which impressed Ma rgare t Anderson and her friends, not the dances which fa scinated the town. Jean Toom er's reaction to the prospectus had also been primarily intellectual; but this did not exclude a highly emotional reaction to the move ments. A slightly damaging fa ct was that Waldo Frank's literary patronage had resulted in an intimate association between Frank' s wif e, Margaret Naum­ burg, and Frank's protege , Jean Toomer. The pair attended one of the demons trat ions together which, accor ding to Too mer, was held in Webster Hall. He was impressed by the figure of Thomas de Hartmann at the piano-\"a monk in a tuxed o,\" he thought. More impressive still was the figure of Gu rdjieff , walking up and down the aisles, inspecting the audie nce. Toomer had tried German and Swedish gymnastics as well as the system of F. Mathias Alexan der; and he and Margaret Naumburg decided that Gurdjieff was \"co-ordinated\" in Alexande r's sense. I saw this man in motion, a unit in motion. He was completely of one piece. From the crown of his head down the back of the head, down the neck, down the back and down the legs, there was a remarkable line. Shall I call it a gathered line? It suggested co-ordination, integra tion, knitness, power . . . I was fas cinated by the way the man wal ked. As his fe et touched the floor there seemed to be no weight on them at all-a gli de, a stride , a weightle ss walk. The unusual nature of Gurd jieff's deliberate gait impressed many who met him, \"Like the hind legs of a cat, \" says Mrs. Jessie Orage . \"He look ed,\" recalls a man who knew him during the 1930s, \"as if he were walking at the head of a para de.\" Was this the new kind of man of which Tertium Organum had spoken? \"I was already convinc ed,\" writes To omer, \"that some men, men never heard of by the general world of men, had atta ined various of these higher state s, had come into possession of a superior knowledge and wisdom , a superior power, an almost incredible mastery. They were variously called Masters, Adepts, Mahatmas . I believed that men of this category had existed in ancient times and that there must be some existing at this time. G., I fe lt, could be a Master. Certainly not a saint ... Not a holy man, not a yogi, but -a Master?\" In the dancing itself , Toomer fo und an unexpected release of emotion: To my mind they were amazing e,; � nts that satisfied and exce eded"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"A CRACK IN THE TIMES 283 anything that I could have asked fo r. I was in the audience bu t I saw and fe lt what went on as if I were already one of the particip ants. The perf ormances began at theatre time and continued on and on as though the pupils were capable of endless endurance. By 12 o'clock most of the onlookers had left. The demonstrations continued. I stayed to the very last, fo r I was endlessly fa scinated, and would have been happy if the perf ormance had gone on through the night, every night. As when Ouspensky came to London, the test of commitment seemed to be the giving up of everything and a pilgrimage to Fontainebleau . Too mer was still unconvinced that he could not succeed independently in the sort of \"work\" advertised by Gurdjieff. He pro jected his fe elings outward, in the form of a mild distaste fo r Orage and a sneaking mistrust of Gurd jieff, the Man of Power. He had a number of talks with Orage, who after enlarging on the miser able condition of mechanical man, slipped his qualification into the conversati on: \"Yes, but there is a way out.\" \"That was just what I wan ted to hear, \" wrote To omer, \"in just so many words, fr om him. I myself was intuitively certain that there was a way out, but I wanted it said by someone who impressed me as having fo und it.\" Such reassurance could not conquer the fe ar he fe lt of Gurd jieff . \"He seemed to have everything that could be asked of a developed human being, a teacher and a master. Knowledge , integratio n, many-sided ness, power-in fact he had a bit too much power fo r my comf ort .... I held back, G.' s power disturbed me. I was not sure of it, and I wanted to be sure before I placed myself wholly in his hands. This at any rate was how I explained it to myself. \" He reacted in the fa shion which Jane Heap later called \"the bolting of beginners ,\" and La New York while the demonstrations were still in progr ess. Gurdjieff moved his troupe to the sma ll Neighborhood Playho use in Greenwich Village , which had been lent to him by a wealthy fa mily who were fr iends of Mary Mowbray-Clarke of the Sunwise Turn . Here, he began to concentrate on screening likely candidates fo r the Inst itute. The 'Neighborhood Playho use was well known to New York intellectuals­ Corham Munson's wif e, Elizabeth Delza, had danced there-and admission 'was by invitation only. Gurdjieff stood in the fo yer of the theater scanning his audience . Ag ain, the susceptible were impressed by his mere presence. \"He had a presence impossible to describe ,\" writes Margaret Anderson, ''becau se I had never encountered another with which to compare it. \" The Neighborhood Playho use demonstrations separated the likely candi­ dates from the less hopeful prospects . Once again Orage acted as the interpre ter, and from the small audiences of 100-150 there began to e merge those who becam e his chief supporte rs. The Munsons were overwh elmed; on the night of her first visit, Elizabeth Delza could scarcely sleep fo r the \"revivifying\" effect of the dances in which she discovered \"a"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE unique theatrical experience .\" Hart Crane arrived, and some witn esses thought he was drunk, although it may have been exc essive devotion to Gurdjieff which exaggerated his condition . His companion of the evening, Susan Jenkins Brown , remembers merely that \"H art and I were irrev erent but well-behaved . . . .\" Irrevere nt or not, Crane was, at the time, extremely impressed: \"Things were done by amateurs ,\" he informed his mother, \"which would stump the Russian ballet, I'm sur e. \" It is easy to give the fa lse impression that \"all New York\"-to quote Ma rgaret Anderson -was reeling under the impact of Gurdjieff. \"All New York\" was interested in the initial sensation, but the lasting impact of the 1924 visit was limited to the small groups of intellectuals who have been mentioned. Conditions were , in fac t, not very bright fo r Gurdjieff and his pupils in February 1924. \"As time passe d,\" Thomas de Hartmann wrote , \"there were fe wer and fe wer people in our audience; and we had no fu rther prospects. Our fo od ration diminished day by da y.\" Gurd jieff ordered everyone to find work . In the nick of time, de Hartmann renewed an old acqu aintance which enabled him to make a booking fo r Chicago. Orage was dispatched with C. S. Nott, a young assistant fr om the Sunwise Turn, to prepare the ground in Chicago and in Boston and Philadelphia on the way . The pupils fo llow ed, and Jessie Dwight offered Gurdjieff a large contribu­ tion to the Inst itute in exchange fo r permission to accompany him. Despite the tours, and even a letter printed by the New York Times from novelist Zona Gale appea ling to the public to support the final demonstra­ tion at Carnegie Hall, the expedition had been, in Claude Brag don's phra se, \"disappointing, even disastro us ,\" and as Bragdon noted, when the party returned to Fontainebleau, Orage was left \"to devise ways to pay their debts and to continue the campai gn .\" At least he was left with a base on which to build. Groups began to fo rm fo r the study of Gurd jieff's ideas. One began to meet in the Jane Heap house on East 9th Street.

He had taken six months to make up his mind, and was eager to be off. Most of his fri ends were unavailabl e. Margaret Naumburg was in Reno fr om where she wrote him agitated leters, inquiring whether Orage knew of the relatio nship between her and Waldo Frank, and informing Too mer that she had just finished reading Isis Unveiled . The various obstacles in the p ath of her own pro jected visit to Fontainebleau were gradually being cleared away. Toomer did seek out Hart Cran e. \"My fe eling fo r Hart was as warm as eve r,\" he later noted, \"and I had a sense that this might be the p arting of our ways . Crane was moving fu rther away fr om Gurdjieff and was soon to start an atte mpt to dissuade his fr iends from having anything to do with the Institute or with Orage . Gorham Mu nson and his wif e were out of town fo r several weeks , and a tortured correspondence Hew between him and Toomer. How did the discovery of a Master affect relations with the doyen of their literary circ le, Waldo Frank? Frank, after all, had assumed the airs of a prophet and they were in a sense deserting a standard to which Hart Crane was remaining loyal . Was all their writing, Munson wondered, based on self -decepti on? Too mer was little help; fo r now that he had made his commitment, he rested in its security . On July 17, Too mer wrote to Munson: \"I did not ask you to choose between Waldo and Gu rdj ieff. I simply stated an opposition as I saw it ... to me Waldo stands fo r what not to do, whereas Gurd jieff stands fo r what to do.\" This was an opinion to which Munson soon became converted, and in a fe w years' time he would be broadcasting his convictions fr om the housetops. Orage replied \"promptly\" to To omer's request fo r an interview, and the novelist was quickly enrolled as a member of the Institute. He passed the time before his boat sailed by attending Orage's groups as a preparation fo r the Prieure. His originally cool attitude to Orage grew steadily wa rmer, until just before his departure, he was inspired by the older man's exhortatio ns about the value of his fo rthcoming eKperience. \"I can still see him seated there in that hot New York room ,\" Toomer wrote, \"he in shirt sleeves and wearing suspenders.

A simple car crash-and the lives of a number of people seemed to hang in the bala nce, poised dizzily between reality and unbelief. Within the fr amework of Gurd jieff's System the accident assumed a new meaning, an embarr assment of meanings, a confusion in which many possible interpreta­ tions took root and sprouted consequences like tropical vines. It was Gurd jieff's custom to spend two days in the week away fr om Fontainebleau and to drive back to the Prieure in the afternoon . During the hectic period after the purchase of the Prieure, he often made this journey. In \"The Material Questio n,\" he tells how the organization of his new establishment and the demands of his practice as a hypnotist so tired him that he fe ll asleep at the wheel one afternoon and awoke in his stalled vehicle at ten o'clock the next morning. Perhaps what Gurd jieff called his \"'charg e-and-crash' with my automobile at fu ll speed into a tree standing silently, like an observer and recko ner of the passage of centuries at a disorderly tempo\" was the result of anoth er such incident. On the other hand, he was an appalling driver, and this was only the first of at least fo ur crashes. \"He drove like a wild man,\" wrote Kathryn Hulme of her meeting with Gurd jieff in 1932, \"cutting in and out of traffic without hand signals or even space to acco mmodate his car in the lanes he suddenly switched to 288"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Portrait of Ushe Narzuno ff, supposedly taken in 1898, and published by the French scholar Joseph Deniker. ."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"A CHAPTER OF ACCIDEN TS 289 . . . the chances he took overtaking buses and trucks were terrifying .\" On the day of his acci dent, Gurd jieff had had lunch in an Armenian restaurant before leaving Paris fo r Fontainebleau ; and, if large quantities of spirits had acco mpanied the meal, perhaps the consequences were predicta ble. Mme. de Hartmann blames the accident on the steering wheel which was fo und to be broken after the cras h. She is the chief witness to the events of that day . And very odd they were. Mme. de Hartmann was still acting as Gurd jieff's secretary and steward . On the morning of July 5, 1924 she called fo r Gurd jieff at his new Paris apartm ent on the Boulevard Pereire. They had planned an expedition fr om Paris to inspect some equipment which she had ordered fo r the Prieure, but Gurd jieff abruptly postponed the tour of inspection. This astonished her because of his customary consider ateness to those with whom he had dealings outside his work . She was then told to persuade her parents to emigrate from Russia to avoid a fa mine which Gurdjieff predicted . More inte resting still, she was given Gurd jieff's power of attor ney. She was to tell the mechanic in the garage where Gurd jieff kept his Citroen to check the car thoroughl y, especially the steering whe el. Then her plans fo r the day were further disrupted. Instead of traveling with Gurd jieff to the Prieure by car, she was told to make an inventory of his apartm ent and to return by train. Gurd jieff departed , leaving her disgruntled at the prospect of a stifling railway journey in midsummer. During the afternoon she fe ll asleep at her task and was awa kened by what sounded like Gurd jieff's voice calling her name, \"Olga Arca dievnal\" By her watch it was 4:30, half an hour before she had to catch her train to Fonta inebleau. On her arrival she learned that Gurd jieff had been taken to f.he hospital, and at the hospital she fo und her husband and Dr. Stoerneval. It appeared that Gurd jieff had \"severe head injuries and lace rations of the hands .\" No bones had been broken and the skull was sound. Gurd jieff's case was turned over to two Russian doct ors, and the next morning he was brought home-apparently still con cussed and unconscious-in which state Jie remained fo r five days . While helping to nurse Gurdjieff, Mme. de Hartmann had to hold his .wrist. Although he was unc onscious, she fe lt \"his fist clench with great I9rce .\" There are other rumors that even while unconscious Gurd jieff told his attendants where to massage him. Jessie Dwight was present when Gurd jieff arrived back from the hospital and saw him look at her. A passage fr om C. S. Nott's book, Teachings of Gurd jwff, describes the imme diate impact of the news: Gurd jieff was brought out on a stretcher, his head covered with banda ges; he was unconsc ious, but he murmured, \"Ma ny people, many people .\" He was carried upstairs to his room."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"290 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE A hush descended on us; everyone went about his work quietly and seriously. A few were weeping, though there was a complete absence of conventional expr essions of sorrow. Gurd jieff's condition was very serious; the doctors were not very hopeful fo r his recovery; the wonder was that he had not been killed instantly. Later in the day I went up to the garage in Fontaineblea u to get something fr om his car, a small Citroen, which had been towed there. The radiator was crushed, the engine was off its seating, the steering column was broken, screen and doors and windows smashed, the fr ont axle and wings crumpled. Gurd jieff had been fo und lying on the grass verge on the road that runs fr om Paris to Fonta inebleau, his head on a cushion of the car. How he had got out of the car, whether he had got himself out or was car ried, was not clear . The life of the Institute was dislocated. \"There was silence in the Prieure ,\" writes Nott, \"we spoke with lowered voices; the bell in the belfry no longer rang; there were no dances or music in the Study House and everyone wished with his whole being fo r Gurd jieff's recovery ... it was as if the mainspring of a great machine had broken and the machine was running on its moment um . The fo rce that moved our lives was go ne.\" The real extent of the crisis fo r the Institute's inhabitants is shown in the account of Margaret Anderson's young nephew, Fritz Peters. Fritz and his brother Tom had been adopted by Jane Heap after the breakup of their parents' marrriage and, with the conversion of the editors of The Little Review, fo und themselves living at the Prie ure-a somewhat extraordinary boarding school . The brothers had arrived just bef ore the crash and had time to see something of the ordinary operations of the Institute. \"The very existence of the Institute depended entirely on G.' s presence ,\" wrote Fritz Peters. \"It was he who assigned work to every indivi dual-and up to that moment he had supervised personally every detail of the running of the scho ol. Now the imminent possibility of his death brought everything to a sta ndstill. It was only thanks to the initiative of a fe w of the older students, most of whom had come to him fr om Russia, that we continued to eat regularly .\" The boy had been told to mow the lawns every day, and continued to pe rform what he regarded as a sacred obligation eespite the threats and ostracism from the pupils in aut hority . Having given their wills into Gurd jieff's keeping, it seems that the disciples had litde common sense left ... or was there some deeper reason ? As Peters write s: \"What surprises me now is that I was not categorically fo rbidden to continue, or even fo rcibly restrained . The only explanation that I can find is that his power over his pupils was such that no single individual was willing to t ake , the responsibility of totally denying what he had told me. \""},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"A CHAPTER OF ACCIDE NTS 291 Mme. de Hartmann took over the administ ration of the Prieure, while her husband and Mme.

Acco rding to Thomas de Hartma nn, \"We fe lt we had to protect him, though we might be wrong. We did not know his real condition . How could we? But to let him do everything like a healthy person-as fo r instance , to drive a car again quite soon-we fe lt obliged to stop him. We had to do it and to try to d o it in such a way that no one could notice it and that he himself would not realise our intention if he really were still not quite recovered .\" Gurd jieff at length appeared in the gardens. \"His head was bandaged and his eyes concealed behind dark glasses. His sight was so impaired that he did not recogn ise us,\" writes Nott. \"Against the doctor 's instructions and warnings he had made a tremendous effort to get up. At first he would take a few steps, then stop. After fifteen minutes he was taken back to bed. But each day he stayed a little longer and walked a little further .\" It seemed that Gurd jieff's proverbial contempt for his body's demands was once more being demons trated as he urged it on its unwilling passage . Jean Too mer fe lt a terrible disappointm ent when he compared the man of power he had admired in New York with this pathetic figure \"who bore almost no resemblance to the Gurd jieff I had seen moving around .... Once begun, Gurd jieff's daily walks with his two compani ons continued rain or shine. My impression was that he took each walk as he took each step, deliberately lUid with unswerving determination . He did not speak to anyone-<>r show an y recogn ition of their existence, if he saw them at all. \" The second phase of Gurd jieff's recovery, as his pupils saw it, began when he was able to superintend work fr om his chair. He directed that large numbers of trees be fe lled and burned before him; and it was thought I1at he drew a fo rm of strength fr om the blaze . \"This continu ed,\" in Notl's 'Wor ds, \"until it looked as if we should have to cut down half the fo rest to keep the fires going. \" At length Gurd jieff called a halt, and more general work began .

But there was another shock in store, what Too mer called \"a bolt\": Gurdjieff one fine day called every person on the place to gather round him. Then he simply announced that he would close the Institute­ \"liquidate\" it was his word. Would we please never again refer to it as the Institute. That was finished. It was to be known fr om now as Le Prieure only, his home where he would invite those sympathetic to him persona lly . \"All my life I have lived fo r others ,\" he said. \"No w I will live fo r myself a while .\" The pupils were given two days to move out. Nott and his fr iends were flabberg asted: \"We did no more work that day, but talked among ourselves, trying to discover if anyone understood what it was all about. 'Is this ,' we asked, 'the end of all the hopes that have been raised in us? Has everything really come to an end? Is his work really finished?' Everyone was mystified-old pupils as well as youn g. \" Acco rding to Nott , most of the Russians and some Americans left the Prieure for good. \"They took him literally .\" Everyone, except fo r Gurd­ jieff's fa mily and his closest associa tes, did leave fo r a short time; but gradually the more obstinate came drifting back . Nott's accou nt treats the dispersal as an obvious \"test\" -rather as Thomas de Hartmann had treated Gurd jieff's announcements in the Caucasus that he was going to abandon work . But despite the Chekhovian sadness of the Russian pupils, it may be wondered whether Gurd jieff's directive was not-at least as fa r as it concerned them- intended to be taken at its fa ce value. He was undoubt­ edly still supporting many of the general mass of Russians at the Prieure; some had no great interest in his work, but fo r a Russian emigrant in the early 1920s it was next to impossible to find lucrative employment. Lif e inside the chateau walls was almost certainly more tolerable than life outside it, even if the provider of life's necessities exercised an in­ comprehensible discipline within his doma in. Jessie Dwight's memory of the dismissal is that Gurd jieff's sense was clear : he would have no more paras ites. And indeed, those summa rily evicted had quickly to find jobs in Par is. Olgivanna became an attendant in a women's lava tory. The \"test\" aspect was certainly present. As the more obstinate pupils drifted back, it emerged that Gur djieff would allow the Americans to stay ."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"A CHAPTER OF ACCI DENTS 293 Jessie Dwight had been directed not to take part in the general exodus, and both Nott and Toomer remained with some half -dozen younger recruits from the United States. It was announced that Gurd jieff was to go away to take a cure, and that the remaining fa ithful would be granted interviews before he left. Toomer's appr ehensiveness overcame him: \"I was to conf ront a man whose knowledge and power I reverenced, who was not himsel f. I had no means of measuring to what degree he was not himsel f. \" In his terror, his questions vanished-a common occurrence with pupils who confronted Gurdjieff, and one which happe ned on this occasion to Nott also. It was decided that Toomer might stay, but after reflection the novelist concluded that, as the situation stood, he would gain more fr om an association with Orage in New York. He \"was hungry fo r ideas , real idea s. \" Nott had decided to leave in order to establish himself in business. Gurdjieff apparently succeeded in persuading even the most tenacious that their proper place was not in the Prieure. The obvious reluctance of Gurd jieff to continue teaching as bef ore prevented further neophytes from crossing the Atlantic. Margaret Naum­ burg had spent most of the summer trying to leave ; and now, by the autumn, fo und that events had fo restalled her. Until the last minute, she was hoping to sail, despite her knowledge of the acc ident and the possibility that Orage-who had gone to France to see Gurdjieff -wo uld fo rbid any further visitors to Fontainebleau . On October 3, 1924, she wrote to Jean Toomer who was still at the Prieure that she was on tenterhooks lest Orage 's return prevent her own departure . She was apprehensive about the effect the news of Gurd jieff's condition might have on the converts in New York, but expected that Orage would say as little as possible. Orage 's position was decided for him by necessity, which meant money. For the work to continue, an incapacitated Gurdjieff must be kept in funds and sometime in the autumn after the great dispersal, Orage set sail for France to discover how matters stood. He was probably at the Prieure by the end of September or the beginning of Octobe r. On what basis affairs proceeded between him and Gu rdjieff, we can only guess, but the upshot was that he returned to New York in November with Jessie Dwight to carry on groups started by Orage after the demon stra tions of the winter and early spr ing. Between midsummer and autumn of 1924, the fact of Gurd jieff's accident completely altered the complexion of his work. The interpretation of the acc ident altered it still fu rther. Was it an acci dent? Gurd jieff's reputation as a dangerous driver, his heavy meal, and the possibility of overwork could all point to pure mischance . He may have had the car checked caref ully because he had"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"294 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE simply felt that there might be something wrong with the steering. Innum erable causes of a completely accidental nature could have sent him off the road into the tree. If it was an accident, this was a real shock. Jean Toom er's reaction was shared by most of the disciples. \"I did not believe it,\" he wrote . \"I did not believe that a man of G.'s order was subject to the accidents that befall ordinary men.\" This was not mere hero worship, but followed from Gurd jieff' s proclai med doctrine. \"Man lives in life under the law of acciden t,\" he had told Ouspensky in Russia. Ordinary sleeping man could begin to free himself from all the mechanical influences which determined his actions only through other influences which had their source \"outside life\" in the \"inner circle\" of humanity. This meant, to all intents and purpos es, Gurd jieff's Work. By \"work on himse lf, \" man could escape from the mechanical law of accident and place himself under the law of fate which governed his real essence. Surely the Master himself had escaped from mechanical laws ? Ouspensky remembered what Gurd jieffhad taugh t, and his own teach ing transmitted the doctrine of accident and fate. His later position is recorded in the book, The F ourlh Way . Questioner: When do we cease to be under the law of accident? Ouspensky: When we develop will. To be completely free from the law of accident is very far, but there are different stage s between complete freedom and our present position. . . . The theory of accidents is very simple. They happen only when the place is empty; if the place is occupied, they cannot happen. Occupied by what? By conscious actions. Some days after the car crash of July 5, Ouspensky came to France . His stepdaughter and Mme. Ouspensky were still at the Institute , but as Ouspensky himse lf had now broken publicly with Gurdj ieff, he had to content himself with telephoning them. He visited the crossroads where the Citroen had crashed, in the company of Boris Mour avieff, who remembered him as: . . . despondent and crushed . After a prolonged silence, he said to me: ''I'm fright ened. . . . This is dreadful . . . Georgeivanitch's Institute was established to escape from the influence of the law of accident under which men spend their lives.

Has he not gone too fa r?-I tell you, I'm terribly afra id!\" Mour avieff lunched with Ouspensky in Fontainebleau , and during the meal his fr iend kept returning to the question of integrity. \"Obvio usl y,\" wrote Mou ravieff, \"the problem fo rmed fo r him a sort of axis. And in consequence off or me unf athomable reasons, he would link the question of integrity and the accid ent which befell Gu rdj ieff. \" Later Mo uravieff remembered a conversation which he connected with this concern of Ouspensk y's. They had dined well in the Place Saint-M ichel and had ad journed, as was Ouspensky's custom when in Paris during the 1920s, to the bars of Montmartre. Since his breach with Gur dj ieff , Mouravieff had been trying in vain to persuade Ouspensky to discuss his fo rmer Master. Without warn ing, he asked him directly why he avoided such a discussion. Suddenly, his expression changed . I had the impression that before me there was another man, and no more the one with whom I had spent the whole of a pleasant evening in the most interesting discussions. He turned abruptly back to me and said in a strange tone of voice : \"Imagine that a member of the fa mily has committed a crime. In the family , one doesn't talk of it!\" Mour avieff is certain that the question was intimately related in Quspensky's mind to the acci dent; and it seems as if Ouspensky thought it possible that the disaster was in some way a punishment fo r Gurd jieff ;�ving offended again st heav en. Had they been wrong all this time, had � failed to recognize something fundament ally evil in this teaching? Curd jieff had said that his Fourth Way was \"aga inst Nature, again st Go d.\" . Was this \"accident\" a proof of his infallibility--or was it divine punishment for his distortion of the truth? Whatev er interpretation is put on Ouspensky's strange conduct, even a sn;.ct1y materialist view of the accident itself could lead his fo llowers into the empyrean . Another explanation went the rounds: Nott attributes it to a ��ciful lady, a theosoph ist,\" who \"spoke mysteriously of the 'dark ibtethren' who were trying to destroy Gurd jieff's wor k.\" He does not reveal the full details of the plot; but it has been enlarged by word of mouth until �e dark brethren are said to have suborned the trees themselves to bend ::<lown and sweep Gurd jieff off the road . It is an uncomf ortable fact that in his Third Series, Curd jieff gave some countenance to the babblings of the lunat ic fr inge; but the question of why he did so is-as always with Gurd jieff -p roble matic . Appar ently, it suited him once more to play the"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"296 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE \"maestro of the supernatural .\" He may have wanted to batten on to one particular fantasist. Or it may have been a test to single out sheep from goats . Or, of course, he may have meant it, and we may all be finding excuses fo r him to save our own self -images. . Accept a completely normal interpretation of the accident-mechani cal failure, bad driving, bad luck, or drows iness. There is no puppet master pulling the strings, no cosmic signific ance attac hed to the crash . Gurdjieff has collided wit h a tree, severely lacerated his hands and is concussed for five days. Afterward he is seen not to be the same man: virtue has gone out of him, and he completely changes the pattern of his life. There is a perf ectly simple explanation fo r this, and it has been eagerly adopted by certain fo llower s of Ouspensky who wish to just ify their teac her's break with his master: Gurd jieff sust ained severe injuries to his head, and was never the same man a gain. His mind deteriorated and he ended in delusion. Even so, there are some inexplicable fe atures of Olga de Hartmann's story of July 5. Gurdjieff seemed to make provision fo r work to go on in his absence , he required a careful che � k of his vehicle and he sent Mme. de Hartmann hom e by herself. Did he fo resee the acci dent? The voice , too; what about the voice which called \"Olga Arca dievna\"? The Great Magician has crash ed, and anythi ng is possible. None of the accounts of the incident has ever been fully explicit, but through them all runs a suspicion that everything was not what it seemed. The evidence p oints to the fact that Gurd jieff knew he was going to cra sh. He made his legal disposition and sent home the secretary who in the normal course of events would have traveled with him. Thomas de Hartmann rem embers that when he returned fr om the United Stat es, Gurdjieff rega rded his pupils \"with a very serious expression .\" The composer connects this with the acci dent which followed : \"We did not know then what awaited us.\" This is typical of the masterly equivocation with which som e of the memoirs of Gurd jieff are written. Gurd jieff must have arranged his accident himself. The crash itself is easily explained, but not certain aspects of it. Gurd jieff's car had after all been checked thoroug hly-particularly the steering gear which Mme. de Hartmann sugg ests caused the accide nt. If Gurd jieff had b een proposing to crash his own car, he would have had to be quite sure that it was in perfect working order. A slight misjudgment, and he would have been killed. Nott's acco unt of the state of the Citroe n admittedly shows that if Gurd jieff staged an accident, he did it thoroug hly; although what else would one expect from a man who used the Russian Civil War as a backdrop to his producti ons?

Lacerated arms and hands could be inflicted on himsel f by a particularly strong-willed man; and there should be no doubt that if Gurd jieff was no magician , he was at least extraordinary enough to disregard physical pain fo r the sake of his work. Head in juries appear to have been limited to severe conc ussion. Note well-there was no obj ection to Gurd jieff's leaving the hospital ; and there were no bones brok en. The n, as soon as possible, he was removed fr om external medical care and placed, first under the supervision of two Russian doctors fr om Pari s, next under the charge of Mme. de Hartma nn, Dr. Stoerna val , and Mme. Ostrowsky . Apart fr om the possibility of collusion with his staff and the doctors , Gurd jieff's own medical knowledge probably extended to counterf eiting the symptoms of concussion fo r a nonmedi cal audie nce, and may even have helped him to judge the impact of his car against the tree. Now rec onsider the events of his arrival back at the Prieure. He looked directly at Jessie Dwight, who also remembers Dr. Stoerneval slamming the door of the car which brought him home-in a manner not calculated to help a patient suff ering fr om conc ussion. Jean Toomer's comments on Gurd jieff's recovery are couched in suggestive language . The italics are mine. \"What I saw, as my impressions registered it, was not a strong man, not a great man, not a man. I saw a l ittle shrunken old person .... \" Some people may have wondered whether the accide nt was genuine, but we are not told direct ly. At least to the sharp -eyed Fritz Peters, there was an element of doubt. He thought he had seen Gurdjieff watching his stubborn lawn mowing fr om a window. Some months after the great man emerged, . reters was detailed to walk behind him carrying a chair on which he could test. Gurdjieff told his attendant that he was \"almost blind\" and that he did not want to worry the others. In his Boyhood with Gurd jieff, Fritz Peters wonders whethe r or not this was the case, although at the time, he writes, \"I was sufficiently convinced of his blindness, because he fre quently wan dered fr om the path.\" The accident was a large-scale test fo r all Gurd jieff's pupils and camp fo llowers .

On a broader canvas , the accid ent furnished a magnificent source of worry and friction to the more credul ous. Who had in fa ct learned anything? Gurdjieff would be able to see the position of many of his disciples more clearly than bef ore; and by such a large shock, he would be able to test the temper ature of his work as a whole . Who needed it, who were freeloaders, who were devoted to him personally and who to his ideas? A thought that is perhaps unworthy-but maybe merely realistic-­ crosses the mind. It might have been very convenient fo r Gu rdjieff, just at this juncture, to change his spots. He had overworked himself to bring his pupils up to the standard required fo r a fund-raising and publicity tour. This had not been a huge success fr om the material point of view. It was time fo r a number of his subordinates to take some responsibility fo r the Work, and he would \"live fo r himself\" fo r a peri od. He now had a pleasant house and a possible source of income which could be tapped at any time by his appearance as the Great Magician . Or simply, he may have wanted a change in the repertory . Perhaps he had seen that the methods which he had intended to use would not prove effective in the delicate business of enlightening the West. His brief acq uaintance with Europe and the United States may have cau sed him t,O revise his plans -what were his plans? -and decide that his methods would turn his disciples into a troupe of perf orming animals. The silly sheep did as they were told. Anothe r production was called fo r, with a much smaller cast. It may be, after all, that the burst of publicity which Gurdjieff had invited was designed to attract a large number of people fo r a short time, so that he could filter them quickly through a fine mesh. Who would commit t h emselves wholeheartedly to the task which he proposed? All these possibilities are implied by the idea that Gurdjieff faked his accide nt, and by its predictable results. On the widest scale the changes were decisive. For Gurdjieff himself it meant a completely altered pattern of activity, fo r Ouspensky an intense inner crisis, fo r every pupil or prospective pupil ago nized heart-searching as all the conflicting possibilities were passed in review. For Orage it meant that he was on his own in a fo reign country. Gurd jieff's own comment on the incident, in Beelzebub's Tales, ref ers to his deliberations three months aft er the crash . \"I then reflect ed,\" he writ es, \"that the atte mpt to preserve the existence of this institution would, in the absence of real people round me and owing to the impossibility of procuring without me the great material means required fo r it, inevitably lead to a catastrophe the result of which, among other things fo r me in my oId age :as"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"A CHAPTER OF ACCI DENTS 299 well as for numerous others wholly dependent on me, would be, so to say, a 'vegetation .' \" So variety is the spice-the red pepper -also of the spiritual life?

For all the brilliance of his career in the great days of the New Age, it is the late 1920s which appear as Orage's apotheosis-the time when his real inclinations operated at their greate st power and to maximum effect. For nearly five years, he had the American field to himself and built up a personal fo llowing as devoted as any he had inspired in Leeds or London. For much of the 1920s, Curdjieff existed fo r American fo llowers of his ideas chiefly as a subject of rumor and speculati on. Some people had met him on the 1924 trip, and a fe w paid visits to Fonta inebleau; but it was only the Master's shadow which stretched acr oss the Atlantic to reinf orce with its obscurely menacing authority Orage's own . Orage's teach ing was quite indiVidual, and one of his pupils dubbed it, \"the O ragean Version .\" In November 1924, Orage began his career as an 'independent teacher of Curd jieff's ideas. That month Century maga zine published his \"Talks with Kath erine Mansfie ld, \" and on December 3 the New Republic printed his essay \"On Love .\" Before Orage's visit to Fontainebleau , Herbert Croly had published two scenes of \"U nedited Opinions\" in which the En glishman had confined him self to literary matters , and on December 31, Orage contrib­ uted another column under this heading. This time the motive was frankly 300"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"PER AMER ICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 301 propaga ndist. His topic was \"Religion in America .\" As Orage saw it, the Americans had confused humanitarian ism with the central object of religion, which was \"the divinisation of man.\" By this he meant \"the development in man of relatively divine qualities and, particularly, of a relatively tran scendent and divine state of consciou sness .\" The assumptions, implicit and explicit, of all religions are, first, that our present normal state of consciousness is not enough, however developed, to satisfy the demands of the perfect life; and second, that there are special means or, if you will, exerc ises and modes of living, comprehended as religion, designed to enable man to attain a higher state of consci ousness in this life. America did not seem prepared, Orage remark ed, to \"risk\" very much on religi on; all the disciplines which achieved popularity-such as psycho­ analysis and Christian Scie nce-pr omised imm ediate benefits. He admitted that no European country had adopted religion in his sense of the term, \"but the tradition lingers like the warm ashes of an old fire. An individual can still catch a Hame fr om it ... Europe is rapidly losing what America has never had. The only question is whether America can snatch the torch before it is cold .\" There may have been more to this appeal than Orage's immed iate mission. Gurd jieff himself later placed great stress on America as a field fo r spreading his ideas, and it may be that even at this stage­ perhaps particularly becau se of the uns ettled political condition of Eu­ rope-the United States had assumed this importance in his eyes. >. An undated circular among the Toomer papers sets down the princip les ch n which Orage based his organiza tion. \"It is proposed to form a number of small groups fo r the study of the Gurd jieff syst em,\" it beg ins. The groups were to consist of both men and women and number between six and ten people. Meetings were to be held weekly, and Orage would \"attend as many meetings as possible .\" There was one strong prohibition : \"Nobody Should atte nd more than one group. \" The grea test succ ess of the spring demonst rations had been to interest dte duennas of the salons, and Orage built on these earlier conq uests . He numbered among his devotees Mrs. Mer edith Hare, Mu riel Draper, and the ubiquitous Mabel Dodge Luhan , who fo r a dozen years had been superintending a literary salon intended to rival that of Gertrude Stein in Par is. Groups met in Jane Heap's house on the Lower East Side, in the homes of Mer edith Hare and Mabel Luhan , and also in Margaret Naumburg' s Walden School.

An editorial in the New Republic fo r January 14, 1925 took up the remark shortly after Orage had begun his ministry. \"At some future time when the world has grown wiser, the hundred neediest cases for whom aid and sympathy are asked at the Christmas season, will not be composed of those suff ering merely material and physical ills. It will be realized that spiritual misery is the truly heart­ rending fo rm of need, and its victims have the gre atest claim upon human sympat hy.\" The meetings presented a bizarre appeara nce. Some of the participants remember Jane Heap arriving in tuxedo smoking a cigar, Mu riel Draper wearing a turban of silk stockings and-the totem and prize exhibit of the groups -Mabel Dodge Luhan's exotic Indian husband, Tony. Claude Bragdon recalled him \"wrapped in his imperturbable dignity and bright red blank et. I could not but contrast the made-up, strai ned fa ces of most of the women present with his bronzed, calm, inscrut able mask. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, the rauco us noises fr om the street competed with the voice of Orage as he lighted one cigarette after another-and fr om another -w hile he told about (sic) the necessity of self -observation to the rest of us- including Tony. It was primitive man and civilised man in dramatic juxtapositi on.\" For three years Waldo Frank attended one of Or age's groups. In a sketch entitled \"M ystery in a Sack Suit,\" published under the pseudonym \"Searchlig ht,\" Frank directed the attention of New Yorker readers to: . . . little knots of people scattered about town in comfortable places­ very intent, largely silent ... , editors, wives of Wall Stree t, prof essors, novelists, single girls, restless businessmen, artistic youths."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"PER AMERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 303 Here were true intellectuals who despised Greenwich Village .

With valedictory sentiment, wipes sentiment off the slate . With logic swift as a machine, he discredits logic . With courte ous manner, drops spiritual bombs into the laps of ladie s who adore him.\" In the words of Elizabeth Munson, Orage had \"a terrible eye fo r the otiose\": a trait which Frank noticed also. \"Or age looks like a boy and his shoulders are sharp . They have a way of shrugging-shrugging off fa ds and facts and systems at a pace poor slow old England could not hope to keep up with. \" Although the lecturer' s charm was having its customa ry effect, there were a fe w dissenting voices. Frank had to def end Orage again st critics who despised the worldly brilliance of his fo llowing, and reminded them that the Buddha had been supported by \"snobbish Brahmins and the rich youth of Benar es.\" The more disillusioned Orageans-t hose who wryly considered themselves \"the hundred neediest cases\" or in T. S. Matthews' phrase , \"a pretty job lot\"-might wonder a little about the degree of conscio usness exhibited by their spell-binding instructor. The chain smoking which nicotined his fingers, his manner of lighting one cigarette from another with \"slightly trembling hands\" -was Orage entirely conscious of these deeply ingrai ned habits? Among Orage 's critics was Edmund Wilson, who resisted the pressures put on him by the New Republic circle to join a group. Orage appeared \"a lim ereal and to me distasteful person .\" Another critic was Orage's old companion of the Cafe Royal, Jacob Epstein, who arrived in New York in 1927 and was most unfavorably impressed by the adulation given to his friend by \"cranks of all sorts .\" The audiences which came under Orage 's goad in fact represented. Considerably more than the predictable collection of Theosop hists, camp followers, and adoring spinsters. Besides the more or less literary and .artistic celebrit ies, there were a number of men of a scientific bent, incl uding John Riordan , a young engineer who was a fr iend of William Carlos William s, and Charles Daly King. Daly King (1895-1962) became an important comment ator on Gurd jieff and Orage ; and in fact was one of the few people to develop the ideas derived from Gurdjieff in a novel direction. He is described by Dr. William Welch, who became his pupil in the mid-1930s, as \"at heart a romantic, a lovable , pugnac ious, well-to-do semi­ dropout from the world of conventional ideas .\" \"Da ly\"-as he was known­ had first been attracted by the demonst ration of Gurd jieff's movements,"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"304 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCL E and was encouraged by Jessie Dwight to attend Orage's groups. He presents the interesting spectacle of a psychologist-a maverick, it is true, but still a psychologi st-who chose his prof ession as a result of the Work . He appointed himself the custodian of Orage 's teaching, and in 1951 issued a sum mary under the title of The Oragean Versio n. One hundred copies were printed, most of which were given to fo rmer Orageans or presented to public librar ies. Apart fr om some jottings made by C. S. Nott, it is through Daly King that Orage 's technique has been preserved. The lucid and conte mpor ary fo rm in which Orage presented Gurd jieff's ideas gave an unnerving complexion to his meetings; fo r whoever heard of a guru more concerned with Eddington and Whitehead than with mystic verbiage and ascetic ism? There was little of the wild-eyed desert father or the sitter on bo trees in Orage ; yet he spoke fa miliarly of the wisdoms of antiquity and brought into the conversation Christianity or the Mahabharata . In his New Yorker articl e, Waldo Frank hit on the uncanny effect which this crea ted: Orage was \"mystery in a sack suit,\" a contradic­ tion in terms. There was something slightly terrifying about him. \"He believes in literally nothing. Nothing that is, I mean. This is what make s him so detach ed. . . .\" The teacher was playing a role and impressions of him vari ed. One pupil remarked on his \"steely toughne ss,\" another on the \"quiet brilliance\" which taught \"pacifically\" without undue pressure. Another noted his \"ease of manner\" and the simplicity of presentation which concealed the depths of what he taught. Yet to another he seemed a man with \"great patience and understanding\" but \"terribly involved .\" The meetings were usually scheduled fo r eight o'clock, although Orage rarely made his appearance until an hour later. They lasted fo r two or three hours and took the fo rm of an extended discussion-sometimes prolonged fo r a select band into the early hours of the morning. Orage never \"lectur ed,\" although he \"talked\" at length, and his old skill- developed in the New Age gatherings-at subtly orga nizing debate came back into play . His technique is outlined in a note of Toomer' s intended as an aide-memoire for his own teach ing: In special terms the effort should be to impregnate a concepti on. Since the terms that are fa miliar to those present are unknown , since the special type of ideas that appeal to each are likewise unknown , it is necessary to broadc ast, to speak with many terms and ideas in the hope that conception will take place in all.

Gorham Munson remembers that Orage 's cunningly hidden hand gave the discussions \"much more shape than is common ... he usually kept things related to a basis fo r discourse and manipulated them towards a definite concl usion .\" Because of this fluid approa ch, we can fo rm no idea of the sequence of Orag e's expositi on; and The Oragean Version is no help, becau se Daly King was unable to do more than synthesize the essent ials. How Orage began a session would probably depend on the mood of the gr oup. Perhaps it would be a striking phrase like that remembered by T. S. Matthews : \"There is not a soul in this room .\" One of his fa vorite Jntroductio ns is recorded by Daly King, and it is straigh tforward Aristot le. this is the division of reality into categories of the Actual and the Potential . At one particular moment, fo r exam ple, we are occupied in reading a book. But we might be holding, ins tead of the book, a glass of beer, a fishing rod , 'or a rifle . In certain circumstances these are all possible obj ects fo r us to hold, and we are even quite likely to take part in the activities which they sugg est. Thus in Orage's distinction, if the Actual state of reality consists in our holding a book and engaging in the activity of reading, all these other ob jects and activ ities fo rm part of the Potential sta te. Excluded fr om the Potential are examples of the manif estly impossible -fo r exam ple, the idea that we are holding a railway engine or the remarkable interstellar COmmunicator invented in the year 3000 on Procyon 4. Reality, in Orage's !leflnition , includes both that which is ha ppening and that which may ha ppen; while unreality includes all impossibilit ies-whether actual impos­ sibilities or potential . Accepted science treats man only as he actually exists, and takes no account of his potential existence. In the syllogism, science, theref ore, only considers one part of human reality and ignores the other. Orage admitted that this might be quite right and proper, but insist ed that 'Gurd jieff's singularity was to consider man also as he may become . Not as ,i'man in quotation marks ,\" in other wor ds, but as Potential Man. The Oragean Versi on begins with a brief introduction to Gurd jieff's Laws of Three and Seven, and with a vague ref erence to the source of this knowledge in \"E soteric Schoo ls.\" This sets the tone of Orage's treatm ent of the fo rms of the ideas themselves: Gurd jieff plus Ouspensky. Orage had ab sorbed Gurd jieff's ideas at the source , but had also experienced them filtered through Ouspensky, and some of Ouspensky's own preoccupa tions, such as eternal recurre nce, fo und a place in his exposition . He was sparing"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"306 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE with his material, but his treatm ent of the structure of the human machine and the plan of the universe fo llows his teachers in almost every detail . His present ation, however, was fo unded on a metaphor of his own . The image is that of explorers setting out to investigate an unknown conti nent. They have never been there : in the last resort all they have to prove the existence of the terra incognita is a map, and they cannot test its accuracy until they undertake the voyage and can match the fe atu res of the landscape against the printed contour lines. But a map they must ha ve, even to execute a landing, and the expedition would be impossible without it. Orage provided his fo llowers with two \"maps .\" The first was Gurd jieff' s ac count of the human mac hine: the three centers , with their diff erent parts ; the mechanicality of man; the various sorts of \"food\" which the organ ism must ingest. The second -a larger pro jection altogether ---c onsisted of Gurd jieff's cosmology with additional material in the fo rm of Ouspensky's speculati ons on time and recurrence . But the distinguishing mark of the Oragean version was the vessel in which his disciples were to sail. Explorers must have a ship to transport them; and the ship of which Orage was captain was called \"the Me tho d.\" He customarily led up to the Method by stressing the mechanicality of man. He was greatly helped by the popularity of behaviorist psychology as purveyed by Dr. John B. Wats on; and newc omers would be cas t into the depths of despair by Orag e's picture of man as a machine . Then came the punch line: the Method provided a way out of man's desperate situati on. The Method was the center of gravity of Orage's teachi ng, and as a catchwo rd, it came to be synonymous with his name or that of Gur dj ieff. In Daly King's record, it is divided into two parts which the psychologist assumed were not complete. The first part consisted of the activity which Ouspensky has made fam iliar -self -observation . But ac cording to the Oragean version, Ouspensky left out most of the details of this proce ss. Simple \"se lf­ observation\" is only the first of three proce sses which must be experienced . Orage began by stressing the Pythagorean precept of \"Know thyself' and holding his pupils to it most literally. He adv ised them to get on terms with the self with whom they would have to live most of their lif e. They were to start with basics -what did they look like, fo r exam ple? They were told to list their physic al characte ristics; and if possible to . have a fr iend film their movements. A questionnaire was suggest ed-what does this creature X (you rself) like, dislike, look fo rward to, fe ar? What would he like to be, to know or to do? What have been his ha ppiest and unhapp iest moments, what are the chara cteristics of his personality, and how does he assess the m? Why does he fe ar to die? There were further tasks: such as a survey of one's lif e conducted as impartially as possible, and another Wltich"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"PER AMERIC AM AD BEEL ZEBUB 307 involved a nightly review of the events of the day imagined as the unrolling of a cinema film. These exercises were designed to give the pupil an idea of himself in his mechanical state and were mere preliminaries to Self­ Observati on. The tech nique was usua lly known among the Orageans as \"Self­ Observation without identificati on\"; but the phrase, \"without identifica­ tion\" was only one of a number of strictures by which Orage defined this very troub lesome activity . Self -Observation implies the separation of the sense of \"I\" from the physical body. The observing 'T' must not \"iden tify\"-in Gurd jieff's phrase- with the thing observed. Neither must there be any inclination fo r the observer to criticize what it sees, to alter what it dislikes, or to analyze what it finds. Sel f- Obser vation must take place in all conditions at all times; fo r this is the Method of the man in the wo rld, the Fourth Way . Orage enume rated the various aspects of human activity to which Self -Obser vation might be applie d. The recommended categories were posture, gesture, movement, fa cial expression, and tone of voice . The exercise was also to be conducted with all possible senses. An example given in The Oragean Version is the obser vation of one's crossed legs. They are easily observed visually ; but another source of information is prOVided by muscular tension. Orage's catalog of senses spilled over fr om the accepted five to include temperature , pain, the sense of balance, and the pulse. The core of the matter was that the observing \"I\" should not identify with the data which it contemplat ed. The technique applied only to the physical body and, at least to begin with, the pupils were not deemed advanced enough to be able to observe an emotion or a thoug ht. An undated note by Jean Too mer on the sort of activity attempted is glossed, �A ll in all, the most vivid bit of observation to date .\" I had been trying to pay attention to what Orage was saying and at the same time to do another thing. This effort rendered some part of the orga nism quite sensi tive. Then Grace Potter asked Orage if he would mind repeating what he had just said. I remembered what he said. Orage implied refusal to do this by stating that she, Grace , was at perfect liberty to ask anyone present ... to do this. The prospect of being called on neither alarm ed me nor caused the pattern and essent ial conduct of his discourse to fa de fr om my mind. Grace turned aro und and named Jean Too mer. This act shocked the orga nism, made it tremble, quiver, grow extremely nerv ous. But still my mind retained the necessary data. But I experienced considerable difficulty in speaking. And at the same time, quite outside the org anism I observed it, the whole scene, with unusual clarity (I doubt that the obser vation itself came from conscious effort) . I observed the effort made. The first"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"308 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE words spoken. I observed the quiver in the voice � [A fo otnote: the posture of the body. The movement of an arm, holding a cigare tte, to knock the ashes in an ash tray. The lampshade . The table. Surrounding faces.] I observed the organism's nervo usness as the fo rmulation proce eded. I was aware of instinctive interfe rence with the mental processes. I observed the cerebral center try to subdue and control the instinctive. I observed the cerebral being worsted in this battle . Finally some word was needed. The mind could not find it. Pause. Blank. I and everything was drawn to find this word . After a while it came from nowhere . Not the right word; but an appropriate one. And soon the task had been completed. Then I made the effort to listen to Orage . I caught his comment. But what he said immedi ately after that was not recorded. The organ ism was still all a-tremble. The cerebral still seeking to control it. I could hear or see nothing of externality because of this conflict . Neverthele ss I did observe it, and this time consci ously. Finally the trembling subsided, the stupor passed away . Again the organ ism fu nctioned in the group. Self-Observation was only the first part of the first stage of Orage's Method. It was supposed to be carried on while the fu rther steps were practic ed. The second of these was known as Participa tion, and was subject to the same qualifications as Self-Observation ; that is, it had also to be practiced without identification, without analys is, and in accordance with all the other precepts which defined the first activity. Participation meant not merely observing a given notion, movement or position, but consci ously taking part in it, consciously inhabiting the action which was being observed . A third step marked the end of the first stage of the Method. This was called Exper iment. Experiment concerned change-or at least at­ tempted change-of the mechanized functioning of the human being. This was change not for the purpose of reform, but for Experimental purposes only: to gain more knowledge and thus a greater conscio usness. Suggested subjects for Experiment were drinking habits, smoking, and the number of hours of sleep taken at night; even the order in which the shoes were put on in the morning could be altered -and then, when the reverse order became customary, the original unconscious habit could be reinstated as a conscious activity . Another fo rm of Experiment, directed to building up an eff ective Will, was the taking and keeping of vows . Experiment in its fullest sense meant the playing of roles. Within the structure of the Oragean Method this activity can be seen in its logical and necessary place, not merely as an exam ple of Gurd jieff's erratic virtuosity. In order to discover his own nature and that of other people, the experi menter adopted roles quite alien to his normal inclinati ons. Extend"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"PER AMERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 309 such activity into dramatic terms, and it is possible to see Gurdjieff's car cr ash, his sometimes inexplicable conduct, and other strange events in diff erent terms. The second part of Orage's Met hod is much quicker to describe than the first, and consists of the two acti vities which Gurdjieff called \"Voluntary Suff ering\" and \"Conscious Labou r. \" The first stage of Voluntary Suff ering was the suppression of the symptoms of negative emot ion-an activity stressed by Ouspensky. An example is to remain externally calm in the face of preposte rous insults. The obj ect of this exercise of severe self -restraint is to produce fr iction , which is said to promote otherwise unobtainable changes in the personality . The category of Conscious Labor seems at once more definite and more specious. The first step is said to consist of \"Pondering ,\" of weighing intellectually the sort of pro blems normally thought of as \"imponderable\" and arr iving at a solution which is entirely one's own. Orage dictated a list of sub jects fo r Pondering, which included the questions- \"ma n,\" \"sex,\" \"consci ousness,\" \"the world ,\" \"the univer se,\" \"nature ,\" \"God\"; Gurd jieff's ideas-\"the octave ,\" \"essence and person­ ality\"; and topics which seem simply to have interested him persona lly­ \"the Bible and other Sacred Books ,\" \"Incarnation and Reincarnati on,\" \"Sp iritualis m.\" The object was to arrive at an interpretation of these questions which satisfied the essent ial man; to resist the opinions implanted by associa tions, by upbringing, by education-and perhaps by the system of unlearning provided by Gurdjieff himself. Other branche s of Gurd jieffian knowledge entered the curriculum of Orage 's pupils. Classes in Gurd jieff's movements were conducted by ' �s smin Howarth , who had been at Fontainebleau , and in 1927 Orage lfu troduced a series of \"ps ychological exerc ises\" based on Gurd jieffian .principles and designed to flex the unused muscles of the mind. A simple example is the sort of counting in unaccustomed ways which Gurdjieff imposed on the perf ormers of his movements. Such a series might vary �o m the comparative simplicity of 1-2-3-4- 4-3-2- 1- 2-3-4-5- 5-4-3-2- 3-4-5-6- 6-5-4-3 to the increasingly complex 1-100, 2-99, 3-98, 4-97. In April 1.927 Orage wrote to Jean Too mer announcing that he was beginning classes .in his exercises that Jun e-\"two nights a week of three hours each\"-and mviting him to atte nd. After these clas ses, fo rtified by halva, black coff ee, and chili con carn e, the Orageans became absorbed in discussion. The morning after such a conversati on, one participant discovered she had left her car near Orage's flat and somehow fo und her way home without it. Such absorption was not purely intellectual ; it extended to the person of Orage . him self. His magnetism at times produced unwelcome results. \"He seemed to know the answer to every questi on,\" Nott writ es; \"his replies were so right that many of us got into the habit of talking everything over with"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"310 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE him-mundane problems as well as psychological ones. In the beginning this helped very much, but some of the weaker ones came to rely on him entirely, and consulted him in everyth ing.\" Philip Mairet describes how a woman pupil \"insisted on his prescribing a diet fo r her indigestion, and he, either in desperation or drollery suggested stout and oysters which , as it turned out, actually did her good.\" Orage was often exasperated with his pupils' demands, and in April 1927, he was complaining to Jean Toomer that \"a prof essional 'psycho-analyst' would make a fortune in my situation; but it brings me nothing whatever except experience .\" Placed on a pedestal though he might be, Orage taught with Gurd jieff's unavoidable gaze peering over his shoulder, and the strange Caucasian accents of his Master began to mingle rather oddly with the voice of reason. Between November 1924 and the spring of 1929, Orage was responsible to himself alone for the conduct of his groups in New York. In self-imposed isolation , Gurdjieff maintained a reduced establi shment at Fontainebleau, answering -as he later explained-only those letters with enclosures whi<!h bore figures ending in a satisfactory number of zeros. He was immersed in literary activity. This new venture had begun soon after the car crash, and his American fo llowers were first to fe el the effects of their Master's industry. Gurd jieff was writing what proved to be Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson . Sometimes he dictated in Russian to Mme. de Hartma nn, sometimes he scribbled in notebooks in Armenian . His efforts were roughly translated by Russian- and Armenian-speaking pupils, and sent aeross the Atlantic to Orage . Orage improved the English of the tra nslations and made use of Gurd jieff's bottomless allegory in his groups. Beelzebub's Tales is a leviathan of a book . The printed edition is over 1,2 00 pages long. P. L. Travers has described it as \"a great, lumbering, Hying cathedral\" and the prose as \"labyrinth ine.\" The subject matter comprises the explanat ions given by Beelzebub-a wise and ancient being who is at last returning to \"the place of his arising\" after expiating the sins of his youth-to his favorite grandson Hassein. The pair are trave ling through the universe in a space ship with Beelzebub's faithful servant Ahoon, and Beelzebub whiles away the lengthy Hight by answering his grandson's questions about the nature of the cosmos. Ha�sein has developed a particular interest in the state of affairs on the . planet Earth where , a(!COr ding to Beelzebub, conditions of life are quite peculiar, with the natural order turned topsy-turvy because of a mistake on the part of certain cosmic authoritie s. The language used by Beelzebub is labored, the periods are few and far betw een, and to reach Gurd jieff's meaning, the reader has to hack through a jungle of verbiage apparently arran ged so as to lose him in a thicket of subordinate clauses. The whole is spiced with Gurd jieff's"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"PER AMERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 311 cumbrous sense of humor and flavored with terms coined fr om every language under the sun. If the reader were patient enough, he would discover the doctri ne which Gurd jieff had stated simply in Russia camou­ flaged under a mass of new term s. The book can have no casual readers because it is fr ankly impenet rable ; and although Orage's fo llowers might have fo und both the fo rm and the subst ance of Gurd jieff's teac hing in Beelzebub's Tales, the dim religious light of Gurd jieff's \"flying cathedral\" must have come as a shock after the bright illumination in the orderly building of Orage 's mind. Orage himself was batRed by Gurd jieff's first attempt to give literary fo rm to his vision. Nott-who is often far from accurat e-- says that the first installment of Beelzebub's Tales arrived fr om France in March 1925, and that Orage sent it back as completely unintelligible. Then a revised version arrived which Orage read to his pupils, remarking that this was an entirely diff erent matter. \"We could not make much of it,\" admits Nott. \"Soon, howe ver, something began to work in us; and as more chapters came over, the impact on our fe elings became strong er.\" Orage suggested interpreta­ tions of the puzzling text and emphasized the overriding importance of subsidizing Gurdjieff while he completed his great work. A memorandum of Jean Toomer's, dated December 28, -1925, records Orage as stating that such support was perhaps the most important task fo r any of Gurd jieff's followers. Of the chapter in Beelzebub's Tales called \"The Holy Planet Purgato ry,\" Toomer noted: \"Orage says that he has read thousands of books and nothing in philosophy, nor Plato nor Plotinus, compare s in lucidity, concentra tion, subtlety, etc. , with this cha pter. It leaves all philosophy .be l.. · d. \" .• . >u,Ul At first, Orage or Jessie Dwight read Beelzebub's Tales to the groups, but in later years, Orage conf ounded the book's conf usion by making his pupils-quite literally-fit it together piece by piece. A set time would be appointed when he would leave his office door unlocke d. The pupils were fflade to come and steal\" cyclo styled copies of the translation which were � ered around the room in disorder. In fact, they would have paid a fe e of .�n dollars before perf orming this act of \"the ft.\" In consequence, copies of �t became known simply as THE BOOK were highly prized, and a �mplete copy was a rarity to be treas ured. It was a tragedy when Schuyler Jackson left his laboriou sly collected typescript on a train from New York to J'renton and never recovered it. Ref erence to THE BOOK became common W some intellectual circles as dark hints about the Method. Edmund Wilson was supremely irritated : I did not read Beelzebub's Tales, but I did read Das Kapit al.

People did want fa iths and churches badly .... As Beelzebub's Tales crossed the Atlantic in one direction to create fre sh proble ms fo r the eager student, Orage's pupils made the cros sing in the other. Orage himself was reluctant to send pupils to Fontainebleau, and even when he relented sufficiently to give them a letter of recomm«tn­ dati on, he usually began by trying to discourage the man or woman who was eager to \"give up everything\" to live at the Prieure . For one thing, .' Gurdjieff had officially closed the Institute and discouraged visitors . For another, a request fo r an introduction to Gurd jieff might show what Orage called \"the fa llacy of Going-to- Tibet .\" To one pupil -who eventually lived at the Prieure for some fo ur or five years-he asked tellingly ; \"Why do you want to go? I'm teac hing you her e.\" On the other hand there were those, like Margaret Naumburg, who had been fa scinated by the spectacle of Gurd jieff hims elf, and whom only ill luck had prevented fr om tra veling to France . The wish to sit at the Master's fe et was one which Orage himself certainly understood ; fo r this was exactly what he had done when he left Ouspensky fo r Gurdj ieff. During his first fo ur years in the United States he regularly closed his own groups in the summer and left fo r the Prieure , where he renewed his own contact with Gurd jieff and worked on the translation of his writi ngs. Not just Orage 's authority, but his very life was rooted in the soil of Fontaineble au. His letters to Too mer show that he dreaded the prospect of returning to America from his French retreat. At the Prieu re-as Gurdjieff was later to say of his flat in Pari s-was \"quintessence ,\" a rarified atmosphere ; a far country of the spirit as well as of geogra phy. The exotic associations of the only non-E nglish-speaking country Orage ever visited could only have heightened his sense that the Prieure was \"special place .\" The summer of 1925 was the first after Gurd jieff's car crash and visitors were fe w. When the Irish poet, Monk Gibbon, arriv ed, the chateau and its grounds presented a deso late appearance . He fo und only two disciples, \"a very serious -looking young man, with sandy hair, from the English Midlands, and a young girl with flaming red hair fr om America.

He was shown the Institute's prospectus and lectured on the happiness of Katherine Mansfield. Then he was taken by the Englishma n-probably a pupil called Bernard Me tz-to see the Study House. The interior suggested a Turkish bath that had fal len on evil days. Someone had whitewas hed the walls and strewn a fe w worn carpets about the floor . Someone else had begun a series of gar ish, oriental wal l-decorations which had not got very fa r. Despite the brightness of the colours an air of intolerable melancholy streamed fr om those uneven white surf ace s, those brilliant garish blues and sombre reds. This depressing picture of neglect and inactivi Jy is confirmed by Margaret Naumburg's letters to Jean Toomer, in which she reported on the comatose condition of the Prieure, and the equivocal status of the summer visitors . Margaret Naumburg arrived on June 14, 1925 to find that her coming had been announced by Orage . She was met by Mme. de Hartmann who told her that she would probably be able to stay, but that this depended on Gurdjieff. In the upshot, Gurd jieff's reaction was : if Orage approv ed, so did he. Margaret Naumburg heard his voice dictating late at night when she was in bed, but her first sight of the Master was almost as worrying as Too mer's had been.

Just · before her arrival , the practice of movements had started in the Study House directed by Mme. de Salzmann; and there were readings fr om Gurd jieff's writing in progr ess, including the tale of his Universal Trav el­ l;ng Work shop. Gurd jieff's nephews and nieces, Mme. de Salzmann's �u ghter and Mme. Ouspensky's grandson were being instructed in movements.

He seemed to confuse the relati onship between her and Toomer-perhaps on purpose. He had been announcing for the past five months that his book would be finished in a fe w days' time. \"What would he do when it was completed?\" she asked him. Gurd jieff answered that he did not know. Perhaps he would go away and rest, perhaps he would go to Egypt-p erhap s, just perhaps, he mighrt ake some people at the Prieure, only not-l ike the year before-th ose not seriously interested. Orage and Jane Heap arrived in mid-July, but Margaret Naumburg still felt deprived of what she had come fo r. She informed Toomer that both Jane and Orage were complaining that everything was rundown . Apart from these old friends, she moaned, there was no conversation to be had. The older pupils were arrogan t. They seemed to consider everyone else ment ally defective, and their criticism of Orage smacked of jealousy. As the summer wore on, her disappo intment increas ed. There had evidently been some doubt as to whether Orage would return to New York to carry on his teaching fo r a second year. On August 18, she informed Toomer that this had now been resolv ed, and Orage would after all continue. But she suspected he would try to divert the New Yorkers from work in a practical sense, and talked of going off to Ouspensky next spring. Her time had been wasted, and she wrote resignedly that Toomer had been right to stay in the United State s. Orage and Jessie Dwight returned to New York via England, sailing on October 3. The teaching continued, but next summer there were no new residents at the Prieure. The chateau renlained wrapped in an enchanted slumber, and when Daly King tried to gain admission he fo und no one who seemed to be in authority. Two events of some importance took place that year. The first was the visit of Aleister Crow ley. Crowley knew the town of Fontainebleau well-in 1924 he had spent a tormented period there in an attempt to cure himself of heroin addict ion. The Great Beast was a familiar figure in Paris expatriate circle s, and Nott met him in the capital while himself staying at the Prieure. Crowley's interest was aroused either by a general occult curiosity or by Gurd jieff's reputation as a specialist in curing drug addic tion; and he soon afterward turned up at Fontainebleau, where he was the object of some amaze ment. To one of the inmate s, the Wickedest Man in the World seemed overfed and inoffensive-with the excepti o n of his almost colorless eyes, the antipodes to Gurd jieff's heavy gaze. The published accounts of Crowley at the Prieure speak only of a brief visit and a vaguely sinister impression. Nott records that Crowley spoke to one of the children present about his son whom he was teaching to be a devil. \"Gur djieff got up and spoke to the boy, who thereupon took no further notice of Crowle y. \" But"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"PER AMER ICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 315 the magician's visit was extensive, and his conf rontation with Gurdjieff of a more epic nature . Crowley arrived fo r a whole week end and spent the time like any other visitor to the Prieure; being shown the grounds and the activities in progr ess, listening to Gurd jieff's music and his oracular conversat ion. Apart from some circumspecti on, Gurd jieff treated him like any other guest until the evening of his departure . After dinner on Sun day night, Gurdjieff led the way out of the dining room with Crowley, fo llowed by the body of pupils who had also been at the meal. Crowley made his way toward the door and turned to take his leave of Gurdji eff, who by this time was some way up the stairs to the second floor. \"M ister, you go?\" Gurdjieff inquired. Crowley assented. \"You have been guest?\" -a fa ct which the visitor could hardly deny. \"Now you go, you are no longer guest?\" Crowley-no doubt won dering whether his host had lost his grip on reality and was wandering in a semantic wilderness-humored his mood by indicating that he was on his way back to Par is. But Gurd jieff, having made the point that he was not violating the canons of hospitality, changed on the instant into the embodiment of righte ous anger. \"You filth y,\" he stormed, \"you dirty inside! Never again you set fo ot in my house !\" From his vantage point on the stairs , he worked himself up into a rage which quite transfixed his wa tching pupils. Crowley was stigmatized as the sewer of creation was taken apart and trodden into the mire. Finally, he was banished in the style of East Lynne by a Gurd jieff in fine histrionic fo rm. Whitef aced and shaking, the Great Beast crept back to Paris with his tail between his legs. The second significant event of the summer of 1926 was the death of Mme. Ostrowsky. Fritz Peters calls her \"the most impressive permanent 'resident at the Prieure .\" Katherine Ma nsfield had written that \"she walks abo ut like a queen exactly\"; and Peters confirms this observati on: I remember being particularly fa scinated by the way she moved; she walked without any perceptible movement of her head and without the . . . slightest jerkiness in her movements; she was never hurrie d, but at the same time she moved at incredible speed; every movement she made in whate ver she was doing was absolutely essent ial to that particular . activity. During the early summer of 1926, this silent but imposing woman became increasingly ill. She took to her bed and was put on a special diet ·that included large quantities of blood pressed from meat. It became known that she had terminal cancer, and Gurd jieff told his pupils that she was ,living \"through him.\" Her doctors had put her under sentence of death , he .Said, and he had been able to extend the time limit through his own efforts."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"316 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE \"She live many lives, is very old soul; she now have possihility ascend to other world ,\" he told Fritz Peters. \"But sickness come and make more difficult, make impossible for her to do this thing alone. If can keep alive fe w months more will not have to come back and live this life again.\" An episode in Beelzebub's Tales must refer to Mme. Ostrowsky's death . In the chapter called, \"The Bokharan Dervish Hadji-Asvatz-Tro ov,\" the dervish tells Beelzebub of a European friend who succeeded in discovering a cure for cancer, but almost immediately became the victim of tragedy. Cancer was diagno sed in his wife, but he himself had a road accident which prevented him from putting his cure into effect. When he recovered from his accident, he saw with horror that his wife was so far advanced in the disease that all he could do was to try European medicine. The European doctors recommended X-ray treatment, but this only resulted in fresh outbreaks in other parts of his wife's body. Casting caution to the winds, the husband decided not to spare himself and channeled his energies to effecting some slowing down of the cance r. He managed by this means to keep his wife alive for almost two years . This tale so closely corresponds to the circumstances of Mme. Os­ trowsky's death as to leave no doubt that Gurdjieff is referring to himself. Olga de Hartmann claims that once during Mme. Ostrowsky's last days, Gurdjieff caused a marked improvement in the invalid 's condition by making her drink a glass of water which he had held for a few minutes in his hands. Are we to understand that he really believed he had a cure for cancer, that his knowledge of vibratio ns or Tibetan medicine was in fact superior to Western science? What is clear from his manner of telling the story is that Gurdjieff felt great affection fo r his \"wife\" and that her death was a personal tragedy for him. Fritz Peters had described how, after her death on June 26, 1926, Gurdjieff retired to his room and saw no one for two days. He emerged to greet the archbishop who came to preach the funeral service. \"There were no manif estations of sorrow, no tears, just an unusual heaviness about him, as if it required a great effort for him to move.\" Gurd jieff further confused his pupils by devoting the day of the funeral to embarras sing the archbishop and preventing expressions of grief over Mme. Ostrowsky's death . He described what he said was a traditional funeral custom from more enlightened times. After a death , Gurdjieff claimed, the friends of the dead person would spend three days remember­ ing the evil deeds committed by their acquaintance during his life. They would then begin to concentrate on the fact of their own mortality . A newly arrived recruit to the Prieure was completely bewildered by the funeral feast, during which Gurdjieff kept up a running stream of curses on God."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"PER AMERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 317 Very soon afterward he began living with another woman, who soon became pregna nt. It was the following summer that the real influx of visitors from the United States began . American memories of the Prieure are usually of the years 1927 and 1928. The real reason why Orage persuaded Gurdjieff to allow visitors during these years was financial . The master was concentrat­ ing on literary work which excluded other money-making activity; and at the same time, the cavalier attitude he showed to substantial sums he did receive from his supporters made it seem that subsidizing his activiti es was like trying to fill a bottomless pit. Until his marriage in 1927, Orage lived in what seemed to many of his New York pupils very straitened circumstances in a tiny apartment in Chelsea. Money from admission charges to his meetings went largely to the Prieure . But by the spring of 1927, Orage­ perhaps slightly annoyed that friends like Daly King had been refused admitta nce, and certainly determined that Gurdjieff could do something toward his own keep-was writing to Jean Toomer: As for American visitors to the Prieure this summer, I have written finally to G. for an official permit to authorise such proposa ls. Lots of people want to go from here; but so far I have said neither yes nor no . . . I'm not disposed to countenance formally any such visitations without some assurance from G. that at least they will be admitted or at least considered. He told Gurdjieff that an American would pay an average of 100 dollars per week, and this was the decisive factor. For the next four years , a small �steady trickle of pupils crossed the Atlantic with letters of introduction fro m Orage-or sometimes from Toomer, who was prone to announce his proteges in the style of a minor prophet. \" TO GEORGE IVANOVITCH GURDJIEFF-GREETI NG ! \" began one hortatory letter with which the Chi­ eago poet, Mark Turbyfill -a contributor to The Little Review-arrived at Fon tainebleau. Despite such impressive credentia ls, a candidate for aam ission could never be certain, when he walked up to the doorway with �S onnez Fort\" written beside it, that he would penetrate the enchanted Castle itself. A new arrival at the Prieure would be greeted by one of the senior pupils and probably- unless there was a particularly full house in summ er-given 'Ii . . room in \"the Ritz. \" He was now in a place where everything was Uncert ain, where the possible meanings jarred in hideous confu sion, where b e never knew precisely what might happen at any moment. When"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"318 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurd jieff deigned to take notice of a newcom er, he might meet him in any one of his unpredictable roles. One of the 1927 arrivals was unable to approach the Master during the first twenty-f our hours of his stay becau se, whenever he came anyw here near, Gurd jieff turned and shouted at him. Then at the first of the lavish dinners which the pupil attended, he suddenly felt that Gurd jieff's eye was on him, and on looking up received a beatific smile of welc ome. Or, Gurd jieff might be in a more quizzical vein. When Carl Zigrosser first encountered him in June 1927, he had just been given a conducted tour by Thomas de Hartma nn. When we came near, he opened the conversation by saying, \"I smell American .\" I had been prepared for this sort of greeting by the reports of previous visitors, so I was not as startled as I might have been. He went on to explain in his curious English: \"You no take bath here last night; I smell American smel l.\" After some conversation he asked if I could drink. When I replied that J hoped I could, he invited me to sit beside him at dinner -a place which I learned later was reserved fo r those who drank . He laughed and added that he liked three kinds of people; those who could drink, those who could tell stories-and the third he would tell me about some other time. A few minutes later, he left us and went to his room. Almost as disconcerting as the Master himself were encounters With other pupils. What did they know that the neophyte did not? How should the newc omer behave toward them? A new arrival often felt in the position of a specimen under examinat ion. Nott records that his every action after he arrived was reported to Gurdjieff. Alternati vely, like Toomer in 1925, the neophyte could approach his new acqua intances from a superior height :'he was \"one of the chosen; most of the others could not possibly be.\" In the late 1920s the permanent population of the Prieure was about thirty people. Until 1929 the de Hartmanns and Mme. de Hartma nn's parents , the Schumakers, lived in the chate au. The Stoernevals with their son Nikolai, and Mme. de Salzmann with her two children lived in the Parado u. Alexander de Salzmann worked in Paris during the week and commuted to the Prieure on weekends. Another visitor from Paris was Adele Kaffian, who had been such a fr iend of Katherine Mansfield. A more infrequent bird of passage was Mme. Galumnian or Chaverdian, an Armenian who took a leading part in the translation of Beelzebub's Tales . Although her husband lived in Soviet Russia, she was able to visit Gurd jieff fo r long periods until the early 1930s. Then there was Gurd jieff's family­ his sister and her husban d, his brother Dmitri with his wife and fo ur"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"PER AMERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 319 childr en; also another nephew, Valya, who had made his way alone from Georgia to Fontainebleau . A few other Russians remained fr om the great dispersal. The duties of concierge and mechanic were perf ormed by the Merkouroff s, and the Prieure horse had as its attendant, one Andrei Andreiv itch-u pon whom Gurd jieff once perf ormed an extraordinary cure fo r sciatica after an­ aesthetizing him with Armagnac . Then there was the fo rmer barrister Rachmilievitch, in whose flat the Moscow groups had at one time met. He was an eccentric who Gurdjieff claimed to keep at the Prieure fo r the expre ss purpose of annoying everyone else. Rach milievitch must have been the only pupil who ever tried to extract the truth from Gurd jieff by fo rce. On one occasion he chased Gurd jieff up a tree, and on another, when a party were bathing in the River Loing, he grasped the Master's head and threate ned to hold him under the water until he was enlight ened. A few English remained with Gurd jieff from the period when his following had been recruited by Ouspensky. Three single ladie s-Misses Gord on, Merston and Alexander -attended to household duties or super­ vised the gardens. Bernard Metz, who made the original English transla­ tions of Beelzebub's Tales which Orage rewo rked, was the only Englishman a m ong the permanent residents. From America several young men arrived to stay fo r different periods, including Caesar Zwaska, the \"office boy\" of The Little Review . Jane Heap's adopted sons, Tom and Fritz Peters, added to the populati on, and other visitors arrived fo r weekends or fo r longer perio ds. Some of these came because of an interest in the teaching, but others came to be cured by Gurdjieff of various compla ints. During the later 1920s, the life of the Prieure revived. ;'�\";1he atmosp here was less frenzied than during the period of the Institute lO r the Harmonious Development of Man. Pupils were less likely to be dragged from their beds in the middle of the night to practice movements, and indeed instruction in the movements often completely lapsed. The OOurse of the week ran to a more leisurely pattern, with Saturday night an �e.ning of fe stivity. All afternoon , Dmitri Gurd jieff stoked the boilers :�hich heated the water for the Russian baths, and in the evening men and WOme n separately visited the bathhou se.

Then, when Mr. Gurdjieff gave the signal , men and boys went to the bath-h ouse. The bath was the regular Russian steam bath , accompanied with much joking and story-telling; but sometimes Mr. Gurd jieff' s most valuable remarks came out in the course of this apparently casual conversat ion. He used to call upon each newc omer to tell two or three stories as a payment fo r his bath . On more than one occasion these storytell ing bouts provided an opportunity fo r Gurd jieff to insert a couple of barbs through the chinks in a pupil's armor. A monk from Mount Athos was a guest in the bathho use, and Gurd jieff persuaded him to take part in a battle of \"anecdot es.\" These grew more and more ribald until Gurd jieff turned on the visitor and denounced him fo r obscenity. The monk was struck dumb; and Gurd jieff's comment to Orage was, \"I wished to show him he was no monk.\" At about midnight the feast would be held in the dining room of the Prieure . Gurd jieff sat in the middle on one side of a long oval table with his pupils ranged around him. Exotic dishes appear ed, beginning with large quantities of Russian hors d' oeuvres accompanied by raw herbs -tarrago n, fe nnel, mint, or parsley -which were eaten by hand. Often a sheep's head would be placed in front of Gurd jieff-who would extract the eye and offer it to a newc omer. Those fa miliar with his stratage ms watched as eagerly as the Master to see how the hapless guest would react . Would he refuse brusquely? Would he try to be polite? When pressed by Gurdjieff, would he cave in abruptly or become angry ? More important than the sheep's head were the spirits which circulated with the meal. Gurd jieff disliked wine and frequently played the trick of deca nting vin ordinaire into superior bottles to deceive important guests. He preferred Armagnac or, if that was unobtaina ble, Vieux Marc. In these fiery spirits were drunk the fa mous \"toasts to the idiots .\" The duty of propo sing the toasts was usually delegated to Mme. de Hartmann's father. Each member of the company was assigned a category of \"idiot .\" Gurdjieff used the expression in a dual sense to denote both the various brands of stupidity to which his fo llowers were individually prone and the Greek meaning of idiot signifying a \"priva te person .\" Zigrosser records a sequence of seven \"idiot toasts\" which was used consistently when he visited the Prieure: \"all idiots,\" \"ordinary idiots ,\" \"the candidate fo r idioc y,\" \"the superidiot,\" \"the archidi ot,\" \"the hopeless idiot, \" \"the compassionate idiot.\" In additi on, there were \"squirming idiots\" and idiots both \"round\" and \"squar e,\" each category supposedly conveying something to the people to whom they were appli ed. For example, at one period in the late 1920s, Dr. Stoerneval was an \"arch-idiot ,\" and Orage was the \"super­ idiot .\" A \"squirming idiot\" was supposed to be someone confronted with a"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"PER AM ERICAM AD BEEL ZEBUB 321 particularly unpleasant personality trait; while the round and the square idiots might be identified by reference to Gurd jieff's teaching on the symbols used to denote the developing man. \"Always when presiding at a table,\" Jean Toomer wrote , \"G. has a certain charm and lordline ss. He devours his food and thinks well of you if you do likewise .\" From Toomer's notes it seems that he took part in more expa nsive dinners than many other followers of Gurd jieff, fo r he records some interesting inf ormation about the upper reaches of the idiot range-­ even about the twenty-first idiot whom Gorham Muns on understood to be \"His Endlessness\" or God himself. But Gurdji eff, recalled Toomer, called himself \"the unique idiot. The unique idiot is twenty-one on the scale. You seldom reach a toast to it. Should you, G. guaran tees that while everyone is under the table, he will dance on the tabletop. Also, by the way, it is generally understood by those who dine and drink with him that God is his heir and that when he dies God will then become the unique idiot.\" Only once did a pupil dare to interrupt the sequence of toasts and propose one himself. Predicta bly, this was Rach milievitch , and his toast was to the Master who so infuriated him. The dinner party was larger than usual and had failed to respond to Gurd jieff's prodding. In the middle of the toasts, Rachmilievitch raised his glass and addre ssed Gurd jieff: \"God give you the strength and the manhood ,\" he said, \"to endure your lofty solitude .\" Gurd jieff looked at him-in the words of a pupil to whom Rachmilievitch wrote describing the incide nt-\" kindly, without smilin g.\" After a mome ntary silence, the toasts to the idiots resumed. The society of the Prieure has often been called patriarchal, and the patriarch ruled with a rod of iron. At first Gurdjieff even banned women from his Saturday feasts until two, less in aw e of him than the rest, decided to organize a women's feast among themselves. They sat down to eat in one of the bedroom s-hav ing sent the redoubtable Jane Heap to persuade Mme. Ouspensky (who for a long time was a permanent resi dent) to join them. As the feast began , the door opened and Gurd jieff's portentous figu re appeared iii the doo rway . Looking surprised to see Mme. Ouspensky, he promptly identified the culprits and denounced their illicit celebratio n. \"Never such thing again in my house ,\" he proclai med. Next Saturday the women joined the company in the dining room. Certain pupils, like Orage and de Salzmann, enjoyed the privileges accorded to court jesters, and Gurd jieff's response to a real challenge from another quarter was usually delighted surpri se. At dinner one night Mme. -Stoerneval disgusted him by remembering at great length the excellence of chocolate as it was made in St. Petersburg under the old regime. He embarked on a tirade against the follies of a St. Petersburg education and the trivialities which it encoura ged. Mme. Stoerneval left the r oom; shortly afterward Schumaker, who announced that he could not approve of"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"322 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurd jieff's discourte sy, followed her. Schumaker must have told his wife, who had not been at the meal, fo r she soon appeared in front of Gurd jieff, highly enrag ed. \"I will wager you,\" she said, \"that if someone had brought you your Perrier water even five minutes earlier, this would not have happened .\" Gurd jieff looked up, \"absolutely delight ed,\" and at the first opportunity took her into Fontainebleau where he loaded her with delica cies at the finest patisserie in town . Gurd jieff was now a writer, as well as being a \"teacher of dancing\" and of other things not in the curriculum of a normal eduCational establishment. It was to be expected that his writing methods would be as unconventional as the rest of his activities. During the period after his accident he had written chiefly at night, but as people once more began to dog his footsteps, they were swept up into his irregular routine. He might work at home at the Prieure--in his room if it were winter, or outside on the terrace in the summer. Or, he might take it into his head to go into Fontainebleau, where he sat in the Cafe Henri IV- scribbling illegibly in noteboo ks. He claimed that the spectacle of the world as a passing show encouraged concentration and detachment. In addition , he led another life quite independent of the Prieure. During the 1920s, he had an apartm ent in the seventeenth arrondissement of Paris where he spent two nights a week. Carl Zigrosser once ate a picnic supper there with the Master and Alexander de Salzma nn: \"I shall never fo rget the picture of Mr. Gurd jieff reclining on the bed, as only an Easterner can, a glimpse of his hairy chest showing through his open shirt, his frame shaking with laughter at some story told by Mr. Salzma nn.\" When in Paris, Gurd jieff did his writing in the Cafe de la Paix, sustained by Armagnac and coffee taken with lemon. He liked to spend the evening at a Montmartre restaurant called L'Ecrevisse where he invited groups of friends to eat crayfi sh, of which he was particularly fo nd. The exoticism and inspired chaos which surrounded Gurd jieff were raised to new heights when, after Mme. Ostrowsky's death, he began taking pupils on motor trips through the French countr yside. After his \"accident ,.,,\" many people might have had doubts about the Master's driving ability, and if they remained sanguine, a single expedition would have disabused them of that confidence. As Ouspensky said, Gurd jieff drove a car as if he were riding a horse, and Jane Heap's, fright when she discovered that he had locked the doors from the outside was not at all assumed. Gurdjieff did come to grief, but although on one occas ion he collided with 'a poplar at fifty miles an hour, the most severe in jury among his pupils was a broken shoulder blade . From the Citroens of his early motoring days, Gurd jieff graduated to a big, heavy Fiat in which the back seat could be curtained off so that the staff of secretaries and translators might labor undisturbed by the passing landsca pe."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"PER AMER ICAM AD BEELZEBUB 323 For THE BOOK went with them. Perhaps with Mme. de Hartmann acting as Gurd jieff's amanuensis, jessie Dwight typing on a small portable typewri ter, those temporarily responsible fo r the translations disputing the correct word fo r some abstruse expression, and assorted other pupils confu sing the issue, the Fiat would lurch fo rth on to the high road . (\"How very conve nient, \" de Salzmann once remarked as he surveyed a neatly laid out cemetery sever al thousand fe et below the car window in a vertical drop .) As was usual when Gurd jieff was writing, he invited reactio ns from his audience and was particularly insistent that the translators find the right equivalent fo r a Russian or Armenian phras e. On one occasion the expre ssion at issue was the English \"so to speak.\" The young American who had charge of the English translation stuck to his guns in the face of Gurd jieff's vehement declaration that he meant \"so to say.\" \"I read famous English writer, Algernon Blackwo od,\" he proclai med. \"He say, 'so to say.'\" \"It is 'so to speak,' Mr. Gurdjieff,\" insist ed the young man in frosty tones. Tempers mounted. Then Gurd jieff broke the tension. \"Idio t,\" he said quietly . \"For you I tell.\" \"Short of any mechanical breakdo wn,\" Fritz Peters write s, \"we seemed to have an unusual number of unnecessary experiences on the road.\" Gurd jieff would appoint a map reader -and decline to consult him. He would refuse to stop fo r gas until he ran out- whereupon one of the passengers would have to trudge back to the nearest village . He never carried a spare tire, and so, if a puncture occurred, the tire had to be repaire d, not repla ced. During all these complicati ons, Gurd jieff sat by the side of the road working on Beelzebub's Tales . Food-i n huge quantities and unfamiliar shapes and sizes-acco mpanied the expediti ons. Gurd jieff loved picnicking and was skillful at discovering Russian and Oriental delicacies in Paris. He carried strips of bear's meat which he pressed upon his companions-although he seldom ate much himse lf. On the other hand, if a pupil particularly liked a delicacy , he or she would be lucky to be off ered it. When the party arrived at a hotel, life became even more complica ted. It would undoubtedly be too late fo r the hotel manage ment, and a respecta­ ble-looking ambassador had first to soothe those in authority and reser ve the rooms. Then the party disgorged itself from the Fiat, fe stooned with fragments of cold meat and Beelzebub's Tales . On one occas ion, at a very smart hotel, the hall porter opened the trunk of the car to take out, as he thought, the luggage . He was met by the debris of a Gurdjieffian picnic, . imd a half-melon rolled out on to the ground at his feet.

Dinner prog ressed as it did at the Prieure: with particular tidbits reserved for favored pupils, with Gurd jieff haranguing his companion s, with the toasts to the idiots drunk in Armagnac. By the end of the meal the entire dining room was silent with all ears tuned to catch everything that was said. Then the coup de grace . Gurd jieff belched loudly and looked around. This was the cue fo r others to do the same. Seated at his right hand Orage fo llowed suit-and so on around the table until a fu sillade of belches had emptied the dining room. How did he get away with it? One reason is that he was a very heavy tipper. Sometimes colossal sums would be added to the bills of very modest restaurants -sums exceeding the total of the bill itself. On one occasion Gurd jieff bestowed an unthink ably large tip on the head waiter of a restaurant which produced an execrable lunch. Afterward he explained that he had his reasons. If the lesson struck home, the waiter would encourage the cook to serve other parties as they had served his entourage . People would soon stop visiting the restaurant and Gurd jieff would be magnifi­ cently revenged by ruining the man who had ruined his meal. It was not entirely a matter of money, although when he had money, he was very free with it. There was undoubtedly a certain magne tism, compounded of charm and sheer bravado , which allowed Gurdjieff to sail unscathed through most social irritat ions. Tipping of elevator men and porters, fo r exam ple, was often accomplished with a handf ul of pistachio nuts-mingled with fluff and old pieces of tobacco-which Gurd jieff produced from his pock ets. The cheek of the man- fo r his self-assurance was sometimes less than absolu te-was more than that of a mere flouter of conventi on. Gurd jieff entered the conventions and somehow bent them in his direc tion, leaVing behind him some very puzzled guardians of things as they should be done. There is an absurd magnificence in a man who decides that alcohol is necessary to keep his car radiator from freezing in the Swiss mountains-but it must be alcohol in its sweetest, stickiest, most expensive form: green Chartr euse. Gurdjieffs motor tours were ·usually to Vichy , the South Coast towns, 'Or Switzerlan d-fo r he loved the mountains-and to Normandy and Britta ny. Once it was arranged that a party would leave for Algiers. They reached Marseilles \\\\jth no more than the usual compliea tions, but in Marseilles Gurdjieff decided that they would not go on board ship.

There was a part of Gurdjieff which relished the pleasures of the game and the decepti on, but he cannot be explained away so easily. At the risk of anticipating the final verdict, we must make some partial assessment of what Gurd jieff was trying to do. He said that one stage of his operations was intended to produce in his victims the sensation of their own nothing ness: he wanted a pupil \"not to be nonentity ,\" so first he made him \"feel nonentit y.\" Frequently people came to him because they sensed that something was out of joint, whether they lOcated the trouble within themselve s, or projected it outward on the batu re of the world and indulged in a fit of prostration at the universal misery. Out of the ashes of the old personality with which they were identified, a new individual might grow. The insults, the occas ionally �ildish behavior, and the elaborate jokes were not only part of Gurd jieff's � ansive individuality, but helped to create around him the atmosphere of double meanings, extraordinary significance , withdr awal from the ebb and ,BOw of ordinary living. Within Gurd jieff's orbit all things were possible, '!teca use reality was marginally shifted out of phase so that the connections :� cause and effect were altered and the pupil could eliminate conditioned reflexes and-in an effort to find his way through the maze of paradox­ become hims elf. 325"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"326 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE It was possible to ignore this side of his work altoge ther, or to be totally repelled by it. Georgette Leblanc had a disastrous first weekend at the Prieure. Afterward she was driven to the station at Avon by a visitor who had been summoned by Gurd jieff to act as chauff eur. \"Impossible walk,\" he had informed her. \"She too angry .\" All the way to the station the irate Mme. Leblanc wondered volubly how anyone could stay at the Prieure under that unpleasant charlatan Gurdjieff: but later she came back and became one of his most devoted followers . Her friend Margaret Anderson prints an acco unt by the American novelis t and publisher's editor, Solita Solano-who met Gurd jieff fo r the first time in 1927-of a similar experience, pitched in a lower key. I hoped fo r a demigod, a superman of saintly countenance , not this \"strange\" ecru man about whom I could see nothing extraordinary except the size and power of his eyes. The impact everyone expected him to make upon me did not arri;ve. In the evening I listened to a reading from his vaunted book. It bored me. Thereupon I rejected him intellectually , although with good humour. Later in the study house (how annoyed I was that women were not allowed to smoke there) I heard the famous music, played, I believe, by M. de Hartma nn. This, almost from the first measures, I also rejected. A week or so later in Paris I accompanied Margaret and Jane, who had not quite given me . up, to a restaurant where ecrevisses were the specialty which Mr. Gurd jieff was coming to eat with about twenty of his fo llowers. He seated me next to him and fo r two hours muttered in broken English. I rejected his language, the suit he was wear ing and his table manners; I decided that I rather disliked him. Seven years later Solita Solano also went back to Gurdjieff \"in a crisis of miser y.\" There undoubtedly had to be a need-although the nature of this need might be quite undefined -before a pupil would commit him or herself to his rugged ministry. The testimony of his pupils shows that they believed themselves to have discovered much that was of value in their contact with him. To history it may seem that nothing very much was going on; but if the pupil opened himself to the new meanings, and tried to balance on the knife-edge between yes and no, he might discover within the fabric of historical \"events\" another texture, other potentialit ies: new uses for the input of human experience. Perhaps buying a bottle of green Chart reuse to use as an antifreeze seems a school boyish prank; but it was a fragm ent of a larger chara cterizat ion, part of the regalia of the invisible man.

The experience of two"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR OF AVON 327 Americans as different from each other as chalk from cheese, who lived fo r periods at the Prieure, shows how life with Gurd jieff could be conducted on completely different levels. One spent the time from spring to autumn of 1931 at Fontai nebleau. He had joined Orage 's groups in New York chiefly because he was in hot pursuit of a girl who went on to become a pillar of the Work. He had a healthy respect for Gurdjieff as a practical psycholog ist and certainly as a man who was able to \"get his numbe r.\" He suffered from no great existential anxiety , and took no deep interest in the philosophical problems raised by Gurd jieff's ideas. But once at the Prieure, his money ran out, and he was marooned -a rather irreverent acolyte- within the chateau grounds. Quite cheerfully he would weed paths and perf orm his share of the work-af ter all, it was summer, wine was cheap , there were compan­ ions of his own age, and the Master was often away . He became known chiefly fo r composing a Prieure song with a chorus which ran: \"Trootitoot­ toot; rootitoot-toot, we are the boys of the Institute l\" Then one day while washing up, he confided to the woman pupil who was helping him that he personally was \"not going anywhe re.\" The woman promptly inf ormed Gurd jieff, who sent for him next morning. When the summons came, the composer of Institute songs was amusing himself by trying to catch the goldfi sh in the fountain. Gurd jieff seated him, gave him a cup of coffee and remarked: \"I think you leave now. I think you try somewhere else.\" The young man left the Prieure within the hour. In Paris he fo und a job playing professional hockey, and with his first pay check went to see Gurd jieff at the Cafe de la Paix. Their relations remained amicable for some time, and the renegade received practical advice which he valued from a man whose . preten sions to cosmic knowledge concerned him not at all. A complete contrast is provided by the story of how another young American left the Prieure. He had become interested in Orag e's groups w4ile still at the university, and being of a literary and philosophical turn of l;Ilind belonged to the generation influenced by The Little Review and its attempt to penetrate the thick skin of.Am erican philisti nism. He became �ply committed to the practice of Gurd jieff's ideas and lived at the Prieure almost continuously from the autumn of 1927 to that of 1931, taking over the English translation of Beelzebub's Tales from Bernard Metz. When he decided that it was time fo r him to leave , he approached Gurd jieff and told him that he wanted to go and live by himself in Paris. \"This all rig ht,\" replied Gurdjieff , \"only I give you exerc ises.\" The pupil wanted no exercises and refused them. Gurd jieff flew into a passion. He was wasting everythi ng he had done, he cried. The results of four years' work would be W ssipat ed. When the pupil showed no signs of giving in to this line of attack , Gurdjieff changed his strategy . From a drawer in the table at which"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"328 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE he was sitting, he took out an automa tic. \"Take with you,\" he command ed, \"you will want to shoot yours elf. \" The pupil threw the revolver back to the other side of the table and stalked out. He had no commun ication with Gurd jieff fo r several years , and his interests turned to nonesoteric subjects. But from Rac hmilie vitch , he received a letter describing an occasion when he and Gurd jieff had been discussing \"good pupils\" and \"bad pupils .\" Rac hmiliev itch had put his name forward as that of a \"good pupil .\" Gurd jieff had not answered, but \"benevolently smiled. \" From one point of view this story conta ins everything. But in the last resort, the possibility of any verdict on the process depends on our assessment of Gurd jieff's moti ves. We may concede that pupils did derive benefits fr om his instructi on, possibly that they fo und what they were looking fo r. We may even admit that it is possible to catch a hint of the nature of their experience . But in the last resort, the personality and motives of Gurd jieff must be brought into question, fo r it was on his manipulative skills that the proce ss depended. It could and did go drastically wrong. The many conflicting Gurd jieff s who appeared to different disciples theoretically ensured that the teacher himself remain invisible. But instead, these mysteries, doubts, and contradicti ons produced a composite· \"Gurd­ jieff'-a slightly bearlike animation of the archetypal Fool, the Jester, the Tricks ter, a man with whom no one was ever entirely safe. Thus a man who had made his business the destruction of illusions was to some extent defined by his public image; and in considering Gurd jieff, of all people, it is important to distinguish betw een image and reality. Gurd jieff acquired a reputation , and often rumor rather than experience etched its outlines. In 1952 Time commented that he \"seems to have been a remarkable blend of P. T. Barnum, Rasputin, Freud, Groucho Marx and everybody's grandf ather .\" As a snap judgment this is not inaccura te, and it sketche s the sort of image which now conf ronted those who approached tae Master. The production was no longer the play of the prof essional hypnotist- unless a particular candidate opted fo r that play-but its central charac ter was no less enigmatic than the magician of St. Petersburg. The Fontainebleau papers called him \"the Magus of Valvins\"; and when Zigr osser published his account of how Gurd jiefr had met him with a deflating \"I smell American ,\" the New York Times described this as \"Fe-Fo­ Fumi sm.\" The comment was jocular, of cou rse, but it indicated the unconscious image of Gurdjieff as the ogre at the top of the beanstalk. The image was one of great powe r, even among those who were kept informed of the Master's activ ities. By 1929, D. H. Lawrence was"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR OF AVON 329 endorsing Mabel Luhan's verdict that Gurdjieff was \"an imaginary incarna­ tion of Lucif er.\" Rumor was quite specific about Lucifer's misdemeanors. The poet H.D. (Hilda Dolittle) was said to have extemporized: In the house of your Sphinx The whores Scrub the floors And buy their own drinks. Although Gurdjieff's reputation was always equivocal , the effect of his personal presence never diminished. One former Oragean remembers how, before Gurdjieff's visit to New York in 1929, rumors had been circulating about the \"mysterious and wicked\" figure of the Master of Fonta inebleau. The groups had heard of his \"wickedness with women\" and his ceaseless demands for money. But when Gurdjieff faced Orage's New York groups for the first time, all the rumors \"were erased like chalk off a blackboard .\" The reaction which this particular pupil experienced was exactly that of Ouspensky fourteen years before. She put it in different words: \"He's hidin g.\" Gurd jieff was hiding behind the various roles which he assumed, but he was also concealed behind the leading role of the Master. His own personality quite naturally affected his fundioning as a teache r; and puzzled disciples have often followed Ouspensky in separating Gurdjieff the human being with all his many defects from the system of ideas which he taught. Zigro sser warned in 1929: . H one places too much emphasis on Gurdjieff the man, responding, pleasantly or otherw ise, to his rich, incalculable personality, but making no attempt to divine his ideas, one misses practicalIy every­ thing of value in the contact . . . he is also expounding certain ideas, a certain standard of value s, certain attitu des to life, and a certain technique for meeting it, which I, among others, have found extremely interesting and, as far as I have been able to try them out, sound. The \" rich, incalculable personality\" was on occasion purely mischievou s. Fritz Peters, whose Boyhood with Gurd jieff conveys the impression of Gurdj ieff the man, calls his private character \"complex .\" \"At times ,\" he .,�te s, \"it seemed to me that ... playing with people was literally nothing 'more than a diversion for him, something to take his mind off the continuous pressures under which he worked.\" If he had no other cla ims to fame, Gurd jieff would still be justly celebrated as one of the great masters of the practical joke."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"330 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE The exaggerated respect shown to Gurd jieff did not conceal a certain shiftiness which occas ionally characterized the man. His most alert pupils were by no means uncritical. Beryl Pogson speaks of the \"curious impression\" given by Maurice Nicoll's diary of his time at the Institute. The doctor noticed Gurd jieff's \"weightless eyes , his blushes, his hesitation, his strange power .\" T. S. Matthews noticed that \"everyone, including Orage , was afraid of him, didn't understand him, and never knew what he would do next.\" Matthews identifies an important fe ature of Gurd jieff's character with his description of the \"sly, peasant-shrewd sayings\" of Beelzebub's Tales: fo r there was in Gurd jieff a considerable element of peasant cunning, which compensated fo r a mind which was n ot of the first order. \"Think ing,\" says one former resident at the Prieure, \"was not G.' s thing.\" The wily Levan tine, the haggler over prices, the man constrained by circumst ances to become an acute practical psychologist -there was much of his origins in Gurdjieff. Toward the end of his tenure at the Prieure, one of the inmates remem 'bers him returning from America very short of money. The baker in Avon had become pressing about the settle ment of his small account. Miss Merston tried fruitlessly to postpone the reckon ing; but just then, Gurd jieff walked by, discovered the situation , and quickly charmed the irate baker into submissi on- although he admitted to the trade sman's face that he had no money. The witness was astounded: \"It was pure artistry .\" If the virtues of the Sly Man were larger-than-lif e adaptations of those he had acquired in his native Caucas us, his vices were equally the vices of his native land. The pashalike manners which T. S. Matthews observed, his reputation as a connoi sseur of wine, women and song, his insist ence on traveling accompanied by a train of fo llowe rs, show that Gurd jieff brought the manners of a successful Middle Eastern business man to Europe. The man behind the mask could sometimes be seen peering through the eyeslits. But granted his natural cunning, his coarse ness, his sensua lity­ why should these per se disqualify him from the task he was attempting? The charges against him must be considered one by one. He was a gorma ndizer, a fleshly man, not a spiritual teacher. Gurdjielf certainly always enjoyed his food and drink, although he was never the bibulous glutton of popular imagination . Ever since the early days in Russia, observers noted that he sometimes ate very little at the feasts over which he presided, and he undoubtedly used the euphoric effects of alcohol to loosen up the company for his inspection . Sever al pupils have noted a peculiar effect of the alcohol consumed at Gurd jieff's table: no one became drunk until the Master had left the room. On one occasion, Gurd jieff even threw a glass down the table at a woman pupil who had helped herself to a drink out of tum. But it is true, on the face of things, that Gurdjieff does not"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR OF AVON 331 measure up to conventional standards of how spiritual leaders ought to beha ve. Another charge against him is that of cupidity. Was he out for money? He may have needed large sums for his work, but it is undeniable that he did somehow acquire a chateau�which he called \"my house .\" At different times he maintained various fiats in Paris, and except fo r short period s, he did live off his pupils. But is this so very reprehensible? His prof ession was that of \"teache r\"-whate ver we may think about what he taught-and it was logical that his pupils should support him. As a writer in The Tirrzes Literary Suppl ement once remarke d, it is impossible to imagine him piling up loot in some Swiss bank. For long periods he supported hordes o f indigent Russians; and fo llowers unable to pay fo r themselves were often maintained at the common expen se. After Gurd jieff's death his family were by no means left in easy circu mstances, a fact which is at once explained by Gurd jieff's seignorial attitude to any funds he happened to h ave in his possession. After constant pressure and reminders of the dire straits in which the Master was placed, a supporter might contribute a large sum only to find it dissipated on what appeared to be some quite trivial undertaking. Once Gurd jieff bought the whole population of the Prieure bicycles-and made them learn to ride. Another time he gave all his fo llowers opera glass es. He installed intercoms throughout the Prieure; and on more than one occas ion spent the whole of a generous subsidy on a gargantuan meal for his followers . Nevert heless, the impression remains that he was, as J. G. Bennett once admitted, \"by Western standard s, a shark.\" This is possibly because of his undoubted cunning in wheedling money out of people--not because of SUSpicion that he operated as a shearer of sheep through base motives. Sometimes he may have been teaching the penny-pinching or the gullible lessons in the use of money; sometimes, no doubt, the sheer pleasure of the game impelled him to see how far he could push his luck. Material survival was never greatly in question; for Gurd jieff could have earned his living in my one of a half-a-dozen ways. Then there is Gurd jieff's conduct with women. This is less likely to shock people today than it did in the 1920s and 1930s when the avant-garde _etimes hid beneath its daring cleavag e the heart of a Victorian prude. And perhaps Gurd jieff was not as black as he is paint ed. At least twice he llsked women to marry him (although one was the wife of the Swiss consul !h New York) . But there is no doubt at all that Gurd jieff had sexu al relations \\lVith many of his pupils. The important questions are: under what �nditions did these relation ships take place and what was the effect of Gurd jieff's promiscuity on the women who became his sexual partners ?"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"332 THE HARMONIOUS CIR CLE If Gurd jieff merely used the power of his position to persuade girls to sleep with him, is this a serious offence? This of course depends on who the girl was and on the degree of her willing ness. Some women asked for nothing better than to throw themselves at the Master's feet; but failure to comply with Gurd jieff's plans often led to exclusion from the Work altoge ther. Gurdjieff was certainly a sensual man, and enjoyed the pleasures of the bed as much as those of the table. Fritz Peters was familiar with the aspect of his room at Fontai nebleau : There were rumors at the time, and I am in no position to deny them, that a great deal more went on in his rooms other than drinking coffee and Armagnac . The normal state of his room s after one night indicated that almost any human activity could have taken place there the night before. As any reader of Beelzebub's Tales will become aware, Gurd jieff disapproved of contraceptiv es, and the natural result of his sexual athlet­ icism was a fair-sized family of natural children. Weighing certainty with gossip, it is clear that there are now living about half-a-dozen of his children by various women in his circle. Again Fritz Peters is fa irly specific in a reference to the children at the Prieure. \"With the exception of my brother and myself ,\" he writes, \"all the other children were either relatives­ nieces, nephe ws, etc. , of Mr. Gurdji eff-or his natural childr en.\" T. S. Matthews confirms that the size of Gurd jieff's extended family was quite obvious to memb ers of the New York groups. \"His women followe rs obviously adored him, and some of those who had fo und favor in his sight had visible mementos: swarthy and liqUid-eyed children .\" Gurdjieff did heap presents on his \"calves\"-as he called his children (their mothers were \"cows\"}-when he remembered. But his attitude was at bottom carel ess and negligent. Of course, there may have been an esoteric reason to justify the magisterial antics. One woman follower of Gurd jieff has been reported as saying that \"Gurdjieff used to take us gills into intimacy with him. It was his way of helping us.\" Other suggestions have been made that Gurd jieff's sexual activities were a result of his \"secret\" sexual teachings-perhaps a fo rm of Ta ntTism which he had picked up in the East-but this seems intrinsically unlikely. Without knOWing any more details, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that, after all, physical gratification did play a large part in his moti ves. There may even creep back suggestions of that otherwise inaccurate comparison with Rasputin. Criti cism of Gurd jieff as a cynical materialist takes no account of what he said he was trying to do, and far more serious questions are raised when we come to consider his methods of \"awa kening\" his pupils. In administering"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR OF AVON 333 his \"shocks ,\" he could often be brutally harsh-and sometimes he over­ stepped the limits. Even if we admit the validity of his objectives, it must also be admitted that in a number of cases Gurd jieff's methods ended in tragedy. Either he made a false assessment of a particular pupil, or he was guilty of criminal negligence toward him. He was playing with fire and the game in which he invited his pupils to take part was a dangerous one. In Gurd jieff's view it was better to die than to remain asleep. But a great deal of nonsense has been put fo rth about his ruthlessness. Ranging from the accusations that he killed Katherine Mansfield to the latest notion of him as \"a strange Messiah who let others die in his place ,\" these visions repre sent the idea of Gurdjieff as Lucifer pushed to the ultimate. Although a number of people may have killed themselves as a result of contact with him, there is no way of telling how many desperate folk were saved from self-destruction by the mere fact of having a Master­ figure to lean upon. If casualties and salvage jobs were placed on the scales, it is probable that the balance would tilt significantly in Gurd jieff's favor. This in no way excuses unprincipled conduct toward a pupil at any time. There are two definite cases of suicide fr om the 1920s which clearly illustrate the problems with which the moral censor must deal. I have cut­ both here and in later ref erences-any information which would enable a casual inquirer to identifY the persons conce rned. It would be quite possible for a seriously interested researcher to discover-in time-to whom the names \"Mr. X\" and \"Mrs. Y\" refer. Mr. X was a British diplomat, described by a man who knew him as \"the Harold Nicolson of the F.O. of these days.\" He was born in the late 1880s, took a Double First at his university and led the field in the Foreign Office 'eXams of his year. His chief work took place during the series of peace conferences which fo llowed the First World War, and his achiev ements were recognized by the award of a decorati on. It is clear that he was a brilliant man and might confidently have expected to add a knighthood to the letters which he placed after his name. It may have been through Rowland Kenn ey-who went from journalism to the Foreign Office-that he carn e into contact with Ouspensky and Orage . At all events, the diplomat was possibly the most distinguished recruit to the Prieure, which he seems to have visited during 1924. This means that he would have been there at the time of Gurd jieff's \" accident\" and the resulting confu sion. In describing life at the Institute, J: G. Bennett writes: \"Some people went mad. There were even suicides. Many gave up in despa ir.\" When pressed on the question of suicides, * he mention ed, without naming him, the figure of Mr. X, and hinted that the *I n an interview with the author."},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"334 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE effects of Gurdjieff's closing his Institute were even more shatte ring than can be gathered from Nott or the de Hartma nns. It may well have been the depression caused by Gurdjieff's announce ment that he was shutting up shop which drove the less well-balanced of his pupils over the brink. This makes sense in terms of what little more we know about Mr. X, and it emphasizes the point that, with a large number of pupils, Gurdjieff could not keep track of each individual's personal situati on. Enough is now known about the dangerous effects of breaking off a psychoanalysis while the patient is still in a dependent state to make it clear that even an exceptionally intelligent man like Mr. X would not be immune from the feeling that the sun had gone out. His obituary stated that all his friends and colleagu es had been surprised by his urgent request for transfer to the Middle East. They would have been even more surprised if they had known that Ouspensky had given him the task of contacting the Mevlevi dervishes and finding out all he could. . On his way to his new posting in the summer of 1925, the diplomat and his wife stayed for a few days at the Prieure , which was at this time in a state of suspended animati on. They were befriended by Margaret Naumburg who saw Mr. X as a \"typical\" member of the English upper class; he possessed, she thought, one side of complete conventionality and another which was uncertain and questing. From her letters to Jean Toomer, it is plain that the diplomat was distraught, although there is little to show what was really responsible. Margaret Naumburg succeeded in shocking him severely with the bland statement that his profession must give him an unrivaled opportunity of practicing Gurdjieff's theory of role playing. But despite . her feeling that Mr. X was trapped, even she was unprepared for the news reported by a London daily newspaper that he had shot himself two days after his arrival in the East. We do not know what motives were behind this, although acqua intance s hint at prior unbala nce. It may even be that his conversation with Margaret Naumburg was the straw which broke the back of his tottering self-esteem. Gurdjieff's teaching cannot be shown to have played any specific part in this suicide; and Gurdjieff might merely have been one ingredient in a personal crisis whose main constituents were quite different. But it is at least highly probably that Gurdjieff's standards and orienu.tion induced a state of desperation in which a brilliant man took his own life. The episode does provide a warning that not even the most highly trained intellect was proof against the gloom which attacked less endowed disciple s. A second tragedy took place in the summer of 1927. This was the death of Mrs. Y, a former dancer at the Paris Opera, who had become intrigued with Gurdjieff's ideas through an interest in the movements. She stayed at the Prieure until the demons tration in the Theatre des Champs-Elysees at"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR OF AVON 335 Christmas 1923, and was then persuaded by her husband to abandon the American expedition and to return to Lond on. It was probably in late 1923 that Mrs. Y was involved in an incident with Gurd jieff which has been described as \"near rape .\" Her husband came to Ouspensky's lectures in Warwick Gardens, had nearly entered the Prieure himse lf, and is discreet: \"There were strange rumours about G.,\" he write s, \" ... I had a profound mistrust of the whole venture .\" Behind this reticence is concealed the grave st scandal to trouble the Work until the mid-19 30s. The reverbera­ tions were echoing round the walls of the Institute when the first Americans arrived in the spring of 1924. Even if we excuse Gurd jieff's conduct by the sort of double-thinking which rationa lizes him out of so . many scrape s, the results in this case were appa lling. Mrs. Y seems to have been rendered permanently unstable by her experie nce, and may have made an attempt to return to Fontainebleau . Certainly, during 1927 she was again in France . Her husband met her abroad and was shocked to discover how \"ill\" she was. Mrs. Y returned to England, where in the late summer of 1927, she fe ll from an upper-story window in a south coast boardingho use and was killed. The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide \"whilst of unsound mind .\" Mr. Y refers guardedly to his wife's condition : \"Most of those who left the Prieure , or were banished from it by Gurd jieff hims elf, had the greate st difficulty in readjusting themselves to ordinary life. It was as if they had seen the vision of the new worl d, only to be rejected and thrown back into the chaos from which they had tried to escape. This too often resulted in tragedy in their own lives.\" Mrs. y's death occurred some eighteen months after she had given birth to a child. We do not know whether her final rejection by Gurd jieff took place before or after the birth . Under other circumstances it might be argued that if Gurd jieff had banished her from the Prieure, this was because he considered it her role to look after her husband and family- indeed cases could be cited in which he did exactly this. But there is also the \"near-rape\" to be taken into accou nt, and its effect on a young woman who, as Mr. Y Wro t e , thought she had \"seen the vision of the new world, only to be rej ected.\" Gurd jieff certainly showed a hardness of heart which was quite out of the ordinary. Later he referred to Mrs. Y as someone who \"made trouble\" fo r him. It is always possible that by his own remorseless ethic Gurd jieff had committed no sin. Wake up-or be damned: it is better to die than be da mned . The trouble is that it was not only to his pupils that Gurdjieff nnght appear capable of no wrong. It was an inevitable risk of the function he had taken upon himself that he might come to believe his every action justified by the ends it was designed to attain. If the pupil accepts that the Master is necessary to shock him out of his mechanical state , it is possible to"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"336 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE see how he can also accept the need fo r implicit obedience; for without such docility, how is the Master to engineer the artificial crises which are such an important part of his discipline?

Then his conviction that such methods are necessary to help people \"wake up\" may grow progre ssively stron ger-toge ther with the accumulating pressures which encourage him to half accept a reflected and exaggerated estimate of his own powe rs. Did the ogrish side of the enigmatic Mr. Gurd jieff sometimes take over­ as if Mr. Hyde had been the deliberate creation of Dr. Jekyll, or Frank enstein's monster a projection of part of Frank enstein? Had Gurd jieff invented his role and then begun to identify with it in earnest? It is a question which some of his disciples must occasionally have asked themselve s.

Nott has ·.toId the story of how two visiting psychologists were kept at arm's length by Gurd jieff's impersonation of a genial but bumbling idiot, and it is scarcely Surprising that the most curious stories circulated in the artistic world. Before Monk Gibbon paid his visit to the Prieure, he had discussed Orage 's conversion with A. E. and W. B. Yeats.

When Jane Heap moved to France in the late 1920s , she became close friends with Gertrude Stein, and Leo Stein-although he remained critica l-was familiar with the content of Gurdjieff's ideas. Gertrude Stein and Gurdjieff once met. According to Alice B. Toklas, \"She had nothing against him.\" That the rumor of some connection between the two may well have been true shows how the mediation of Orage had made the ideas of his Master common currency among the influent ial avant-garde . Orage's teachi ng was a lucid presentation of a practical discipline; but it also had about it a self-justificatory flavor. He was advocati ng a philosophy to which he had been drawn for reasons which were by no means purely intellectual ; and of this he was probably aware. This does not mean that his reasons were in some way invalid: his own nature, and that of the audiences whom he had to interest, demanded a justific ation of the way of life he recommended in terms of contempor ary rationali sm. The result was the creation of a body of literature , part propag anda, part apologe tics, which formed a definite \"Oragean\" school of thought. The theme was always the same. Why should write rs, scientists, or publicists abandon their absorbing occupations and fix their gaze on the stars? The answers were always similar: we need a return to first princip les. Approach es varied; and in the end, some of the intellectuals who had surrendered to Orage 's persuasiveness concluded that they had been mistaken, that for all his logic, Orage was 'WTong. They returned to their former occupati ons, although not entirely unmarked. Their situation was similar to that of Middleton Murry and the Adelphi group in England who, after teetering perilously on the edge of the abyss, had fled in alarm. The influence of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Orage as forces to reject is often as significant as their positive role. Jean Toomer was-at least apparently-a model for all thinking men and women of the Oragean persuasion. He had become seriously involved with the ideas at the height of his literary succe ss with Cane . He had accepted one of the standard arguments -that the writei' should become a man before he write-and his dedication seemed to be absolute . But even Toomer wavered at times from the narrow way on which he had set his feet; and the story of his association with Gurdjieff is a paradigm of the relationship of the spirit and the world . In November 1924, Toomer returned to the United States with a hunger"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"ART, SCI ENe E, R ELI G ION AND GYM N A S TI C S 339 for \"real ideas\" which he felt Orage could satisfy. His impatience evidently got the better of him for, on December 8, Orage was admonishing him that \"for a long time our chief concern is to listen, to learn to listen, as G. used to say.\" By January 9, 1925, Toomer was writing repentently to Orage that he would \"like to learn from you, to work with you, more than for­ merly .... Substances in me are turning to Gurdjieff, and, more imme­ diately, to yo u.\" His ambitions changed directi on. He wanted to become an esoteric teacher. Specifically, he wanted to be like Gurdj ieff. The first reward of his new commitment was permission to conduct a group in Harle m. This was not a success, and toward the end of 1925, Toomer left New York for Chicago . When Orage returned from spending the summer and autumn of 1925 at the Prieure, he wrote to his prize subordinate : \"I am very much interested how affairs are proce eding with you in Chicago. Very little indeed of what you are doing has come to my know ledge; and a little of even that is only gossip about a girl! What I should like to hear is how many groups you have, their numbers and quality .... \" Toom er's main achievement was not in building up a circle of prosely tes, but rather in playing a fish long-since hooked by Orage . The pair had designs on Mabel Dodge Luhan and her house in Taos, New Mexico, where she and her husband lived in an isolation sometimes shared by the D. H. Lawre nces-and an increasing number of intellectua ls. Taos was fast bec oming an artist's colony, filled with refugees from the big cities who were concerned to return to the primitive virtues. The Harlem poet, Langston Hughes, wrote a sultry evocation of the place called \" A House in Taos,\" and at once it was assumed that this house was Mabel Luhan 's. 1. Mabel Luhan had been caught by the mission of Orage and Gurdjieff in �a rly 1924. When she had first heard of Gurdjieff's Institute, she wrote to D. H. Lawrence, who at that time was in his most splenetic mood against all things Gurdjieffian. He had replied in January 1924, that he had \"heard e nough about that place at Fontainebleau ... to know that it is a rotten, � se, self-conscious place of people playing a sickly stunt. One doesn't wo nder about it at all,\" he emphasized. \"One knows .\" Nevertheless, SQmetime toward the end of January 1924, the Lawrence s visited the Institute on their way to Baden-Baden. The expedition did nothing to allay Lawre nce's mistrust of Gurdjieff, and Mabel Luhan devoted reams of paper to an attempt at persuading him to try again. These letters read as an appeal :� r inf ormati on; but in fact they were probably an artfully conceived �paign to draw Lawrence into the net. For by the spring of 1926, the writer had long since gone beyond providing house-room for Orage's nestings in New York. Her enthusiasm for Gurdjieff's ideas had a personal aspect : Jean Toomer,"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"340 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE who she had probably met at Orage's meetings. A letter of January 8, 1926, which she wrote to Toomer from a hotel in Santa Fe, shows to what lengths her inf atuation had gone. It had become entangled with her interest in the ideas which Toomer represented, and she suddenly decided that it was vital to start a branch of Gurd jieff's Institute in Taos with Toomer as the chosen instructor. The practical outpouring of her devotion becomes clear in the correspon­ dence between Toomer and Orage . Mabel Luhan had offered her ranch to Gurd jieff to house a full-scale Institute on the lines of Fontainebleau . She had probably also given-<>r been one of the leading spirits in raising -the sum of 15,000 dolla rs, which had been handed over to Toomer as Gurd jieff's representative . Toomer was in commu nication with Mme. de Hartma nn, who was still Gurd jieff's secretary and administrator. He sent 1, 000 dollars to her and asked what he should do with the remaining 14,000 dollars . His own sugge stion was to start a branch of the Institute in Taos. He wrote to Gurd jieff that he had inspected the property, which was suitable fo r encouraging hard work, although too isolated fr om ordinary life fo r a school of the Fourth Way . Of Mabel Luhan he wrote : \"I can hope fo r her, just in so fa r as she will persist in her present idea of fo llowing your method-but I could not persuade myself to certainty in regard to her constancy . \" On February 1, Gurd jieff broke his self -imposed silence with a long letter of thanks to Mabel Luhan . He wrote in the lengthy Armenian sentences of Beelzebub, and the letter was translated by Mme. Galumnian. He explained his rule about not answering letters an.d said that neverthele ss, when Mme. de Hartmann handed him the money, he fe lt he must write personally. He explained that he was at last struggling free from the problems created by the liquidation of the Fontainebleau Institut e-and maintained the fiction that he was also liquidating its various branc hes througho ut the world . He had no time to devote to the money-making activities which could support an Institute, he expla ined; neither could his writing be interrupt ed. He was theref ore compelled to refuse the offer 'of the Taos house. Toomer had lost his chance to establish the well-endowed Institute of his dream s. The 14,000 dollars went into a fund fo r the publication of Beelzebub's Tales, and the Taos plan was abandoned. This no whit diminished the enthusiasm of Mabel Luhan . On April 3, she replied to a letter from Lawrence which ended with the reflection that \"we are all changi ng pretty dras ticall y\"; and agai n, her tone is eager to engage Law rence .

First with non­ identific ation, then participat ion, then experim ent.\" She tried to persuade her friend to sound out Gurd jieff fo r her; and as she suspected that the Master was at that moment on the French Riviera on one of his chaotic expediti ons, might not Lawrence be able to cross the Italian frontier and interview him? Keeping up the pretense that she was asking a favor, she cajoled Lawrence by prote sting her trust in him. She might visit Fon­ tainebleau \"for a week or two in May,\" she wrote ; \"but I'd rather wait to hear from you first.\" Lawr ence had no intention of succumbing. He was tolerant of her interest, and even prepared to investigate it. But he was fu ndament ally oppOsed to the ideology of expanded conscio usness, belieVing that the way to cosmic aware ness lay through the unconsci ous. His annotations of Tertium Orga n um show a total opposition to Ouspensky, and \"As fo r Gourd jieff and Orage and the awakening of various centres and the ultimate I and all that,\" he wrote , \"-to tell you the truth, plainly, I don't know ... There is no way mapped out, and never will be.\" Mrs. Luhan could retrieve her own gam e; Fontainebleau might do her good. The last word from the Lawrence side of the corre spondence came from Frieda Lawre nce, who wrote discouragingly in July: \"I don't like the Gurdjieff s and the Orages and the other little thunderstor ms.\" Meanwhile, Toomer continued his spiritual odyssey. Increasingly, he fe lt himself detached fr om life, his values rooted in the values of the Work . A memora ndum, dated April 10 and 11, 1926, indicates the state which he was seeking: \"the planet Karatas\" to which he refers is mentioned in Beelze bub's Tales as Beelzebub's home planet from which he was exiled fo r presumption, and to which he has painf ully won the right to return . I have an intimation that this Earth, instead of being my home planet -as Toomer assumes and fe els that it is and as it is fo r the plan etary body-will become stran ge, fo reign and remote, while at the same time I will increasingly fe el Karatas or the Sun-A bsolute to be my hom e. This, in the reality of fact, knowle dge, attitude, realisat ion; not in mere words or fa ncy. . . . Let me observe where this remote being, Too mer, dwell s, what he does, where he goes, what things he uses, and how he lives, in general. Let me likewise observe the life of these other remote beings, bipeds, quad rupeds, insects, etc., seeing them all as remote, distant from my native planet, friends, associates and surroundings. If I can hold this state , wherein this Earth-all of it, New York and Toomer's room and friends in New York included-is really the remote place ,"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"342 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE whereas Karatas is really home, the chief feature will then at once wish to leave this place and will become nostalgic, will wish to reach Karat as. And in this way, it can be used to aid my return. In his notes fo r conducting his own group, Too mer had reminded himself to bear in mind \"the nature of the I that is to be conceived .\" Now, in his increasing internalizat ion, he admonished hims elf: \"Tran sfer all depen­ dence and expectancy from the external world, and fr om organism, to I.\" He became awed with the idea which Orage tran smitted as \"man can become a cell in the mind of God.\" Hitherto I have held the attitude that life would help the orga nism, that the organ ism must be helped by something external : this has been my dearest attitude . Now I say that I must help it, and must prepare myself in order to help God. This prospect is at once terrifying and liberat ing. He is a remote being. I am responsible for him and I am responsible fo r myself throughout all time. I am obliged to make all possible effort in all circumstances to preserve, improve and develop him. I am responsible fo r my own realisation. The nearest practical equivalent to \"the planet Karatas\" was the Prieure, where Toomer spent the summer of 1926. He returned to Chicago in September, and a circular announced his first meeting on October 3. There were to be groups fo r both old and new membe.rs and a special group to listen to readings of Beelzebub's Tales . \"Ev ents at Fontainebleau this summer which have a bearing on the work in America will be mention ed.\" The nature of these mysterious events is not state d; and probably the sentence was used by Too mer simply to excite interest in his return fr om France . A month or so later Orage wrote urgently fr om the Prieure-or \"Chateau Gurdjieff, \" as he liked to call it-in the terms of Beelzebub's Tales to ask \"how you are getting on during your first descent to the planet 'Earth'?\" Toom er replied that he conf ronted \"a strange composite of positive and negative feelings towards the work, with very few clear conceptions of what it is about or how it is conducted in groups .\" He fo und that many people were friendly to him personally, but balked at the mention of his mission in Chicago . The \"planet 'Earth' \" was not a hospitable place fo r a pupil-teacher of Gurd jieff's ideas. Next summer he returned to Fontainebleau , partly at the request of Orage , who had decided not to cross the Atlantic that year and wrote that he would feel \"easier in his mind\" if Too mer were at the Prietlre to superintend the summer visitors. In 1927 there were a great many"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"ART, SCIENCE , RELIGION AND GYMNASTICS 343 Americans at Fontainebleau , and Toomer was the senior American pupil present. It seems that, in his elliptical fa shion, Gurd jieff indicated that great things were in store fo r him; but there is little fu rther information about his relat ionship with Gurd jieff until the summer of 1929 when he was again at the Prieure. He was suffering from a prolonged bout of depression which had begun when his novel Transatlantic had been rejected the previous year; and in a note dated September 20, 1929, he analyzed his fe elings. He had returned to Fontainebleau \"after some months of having been comparativ ely asleep in the objective world .\" The French Line turned down a scheme, which he had hoped to arra nge, fo r him to write factually about life aboard one of their ships. This jolted him \"from my comparative state of not fe eling reality and made me again conscious of life as it is, of the real difficu lties involved in managing this orga nism named Toomer. \" He was depressed about sex problems and money. He got drunk repeatedly and wrote of vomiting and nausea in a paroxy sm of self-disgust. While wai ting fo r the publishers Harcourt Brace to pass verdict upon the rewritten version of Transatlantic, he made an entry in his notebook which shows how \"the planet Karatas\" was now becoming the alien wor ld. His fe et were once more touching the surface of that much despised planet Earth . In the midst of my great work I am becoming literary. This idea was fo rmulated one chill rainy twilight as, with two grogs aux [sic] rum under my belt, I walked through the avenue of plane trees fr om the gare at Avon to Le Prieure. It was caused (1) by a recognition of the increasing value I am giving ;i@ all that has to do with writing, (2) by a realisation that many of my inner experiencings are automatically relating themselves to literary fo rms, (3) that I again see, sense, fe el, underst and the world fr om the wint of view of a literary artist, (4) that my literary work again has a living atmosphere . I accept it. I accept it because I understand it is an aspect of my necessary contacting with the ordinary and practical wor lds. This begins the period of my great writing. . Years hence I will again emerge into the world of pure being. This is an eclipse ofJean the saint, an emergence of Jean the man in the world and art ist. Salzma nn: \"Once you were an eagle.

Worse still, he saw things repeating . . . and repeating in the pattern of his life, in a minuscule reminder of eternal recurr ence. Once more he would be returning to Chicago from Fontainebleau , havi ng failed to have a novel accepted. Resignedly, he sailed fo r the United States in October to resume his grou ps. \"Imper fect though it is,\" he wrote, \"I leave my fo rm in Chicago . In Chicago I am and possess all that having a fo rm implies. The minute I leave Chicago , my form tends to dissolve .\" Just as he had reconciled himself to the world in the hopes of success with his novel, he accepted his role as a spiritual director when that succ ess was denied him. Although he was far from downing his pen, Transatlantic was Toomer's attempt at the sole literary fo rm in which he had achieved succ ess. Afterward he burrowed deeper into the core of Gurd jieff's ideas, and his later writings almost all relate to the discipline which he continued to teach. He made his most original contribution to the Work in 1932- some three years after he had temporarily fo lded his wings and decided to join the common herd. With unintentional iron y-fo r he was necessarily ignorant of the battle with literary ambition which Toomer was fighting-Gorham Mu nson published an essay on \"The Significance of Jean Too mer\" in his book Destinations (1928). He held up his fr iend as an example to all American writ ers. An artist fully conscious of the responsibility which his gifts entaile d, Munson wr ote, was fo rced, like Too mer, to seek the solution to the universal questi ons. He was morally bound to seek fo r unity in himself, so that the voice his readers heard would be genuinely his own. Harking back to the days when they sat together at the fe et of Waldo Frank and looked on Tertium Organum as their Bible, Munson wrote of the potential of this new sort of artist, and the reader of Destinations is left in no doubt that in its author's eyes the correct destination was Toomer's indefinable goal . In another essay in the book, \"American Literature and the Unattaitl.a­ bIe,\" Muns on pointed the way in more general terms. He appealed to the disillusioned but not disheartened man; \"the man who has lost his illusions concerning wealth and sex and art and social refu rm, but who has turned searcher with a vengeance , who is desp erate �d practical , skeptical of himsel f, energetic to the point of gratuitous effort and unified by his object, which is self-knowledge and self-developm ent towards a dear but utterly remote standard .\" This might stand as a definition of Oragean Man, and Munson proposed it in direct opposition to the ideal of the whole man embodied in the romantic vision of the art ist. As a leading supporter 'Of the romantic heresy, he selected Waldo Frank. This onslaught on his fo r:mer"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"ART, SCIENC E , RELIGIO N AND GYMN ASTICS 345 mentor was the first of several; for the coming of Orage had fairly split the \"Art as Vision\" circ le, and Munson conceived it his duty to show Frank the error of his ways. Munson was less prominent than Toomer in the Work hierarchy, but was very active on Gurd jieff s behalf and became the unofficial treasurer of the Gurd jieff fund in Ne w York. Kenneth Burke was certainly interested in the ideas and may have conducted a group at some time before he turned Marxist in the 1930s. Hart Crane was the only one of the original circle to hold out staunchly for a more personal vision. \"Your comments on Gorham's shrine and gland-tot emism ,\" he wrote to Allen Tate early in 1927, \"convince me that Orage talked as vaguely and arbitrarily in your presence as he did in mine on a similar occasi on.\" A longer letter to Ivor Winters, written on May 29 of the same year, complains that his friends' mis sionary zeal has broken the ties between them. For even Waldo Frank had become swept up by the Oragean tide. A month or so after Crane decided that he could no longer understand his friends, Frank arrived at the Prieure to stay fo r a weekend with his second wif e, Alma; both Toomer and the Munsons were at Fonta inebleau, and Frank's discomfiture was widely observed. Acco rding to Munson, he was little the wiser fo r his experience in Orage's groups and seemed unaff ected by Gurd jieff's scorn fo r intellectual posturing; he appeared to believe that the Master would welcome him as a fe llow -sage. Instead of meeting Gurd jieff as an equal, he had fo und himself led on a lengthy tour of the Prieure grounds by Russian pupi ls. Eventually, Frank was introduced to Gurdjieff, who thoroughly conf used him by talking in his usual garbled . li;nglish about the still less comprehensible Beelzebub's Tales . Th e Saturday routine wore on, with the bath in the late evening and the fe ast held at midnight in the \"English\" dining room. The Franks were seated on each side of Gurd jieff, who presided patriarchally over a gathering sixty strong. During the meal there was a lull in the conversati on, �d into this Gurd jieff interjected a passage which in Munson's account is s l ightly confused. However, the incident was recorded by another pupil, and Gurd jieff seems to have been implying that Frank treated Alma as a SUbs titute fo r Margaret Naumburg, not as an individual in her own right. ,'�ou not marry Blondi ne,\" he said to Frank, \"why you tell me so? Better you stay with Jewish wife. For Jewish man only Jewish woman corre spond­ ing. In bed he take woman like handkerchief. Truth I tell, woman squirm, si!e know, truth I tell .\" This is strong medicine-unle ss Gurd jieff is to be considered infallible­ and it may be thought questionable . It is all very well fo r Munson to write that \"Gurd jieff's diagnosis was confirmed by their separation two years later,\" and fo r another pupil to claim that he never knew Gurd jieff to be the"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"346 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE cause of a broken marriage . Granted that Gurd jieff had achieved his customary psychological precision in his assessment of the Frank's relati on­ ship, by what standards was he acting? Was it in the best interests of either Waldo or Alma Frank to have their troubles aired in public? By the standards of his Work, the standards of impartial self-assessment and self­ develop ment, Gurd jieff may have been perf ectly correct. But we have no guarantee that the drastic treatm ent at Fontainebleau did not contribute of itself to the breakdown of Frank's marriage . The moral question aside, this thrust undoubtedly told . The rest of the evening seems to have been devoted to testing the Franks . A reading of Beelzebub's Tales dragged on until nearly fo ur in the morning. Eventua lly Waldo Frank cracked and asked permission to go to bed. Gurd jieff instantly gave it and invited both Franks to one of his crayfish dinners. A very short time after the couple had gone to bed, Gurd jieff stopped the reading and dispersed the compa ny. Accor ding to Gorham Munson, Frank's final brush with Gurd jieff took place in L'Ecrevisse. A companion of Gurd jieff was witn ess to this scene. Gurd jieff was nervous, she record s, and his writing was apparently going badly . He was so distracted that he began to sharpen a pencil, although his breast pocket was full of pencils which were already sharp . Waldo Frank was expect ed, and eventually arriv ed. \"Sh aking with rage , he raised his fist and, shaking it at Gurdjieff, yelled, 'Go back to your hell, you devil, and leave us alon e.'\" \"Unfortunat ely,\" remarks Munson, who heard a version of the story from Alma Frank, \"Frank's voice tended to be light and high and the perf ormance was shrill .\" Gurd jieff looked up innocently. \"What angry man say? I not understa nd. \" Waldo Frank made a dramatic exit, and Gurd jieff turned to his companion with whom he had planned a shopping expedition, \"Miss, you pay, eh?\" Munson's epilogue to this story consists of a remark made by Gurd jieff on an expedition to Mont-Saint-M ichel a fe w days late r. Talking of Waldo Frank and Margaret Naumburg, he made the comment: \"Her I like. But he is squared idio t.\" ., The squared idiot had had enough of Gurd jieff -and took refuge in his former inter ests. The novel which he planned to complete during the summer of 1927 was never finished, and his notebooks merely contain what one critic describes as jottings on mystic ism. It may be that the shock of h is weekend at the , Prieure was responsible fo r Frank's re-emergence as the prophet of the New America. Invest igation of the possibili t ies of becoming a more perfect individual had halted , and he reverted to the possibilities of the nation as the more perfect communion of the individual with his kind. During 1928 he produced The Rediscovery of America, which tlie New Republic printed chapter by chapter with Frank's ink scarcely dry on the"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"ART, SCIEN CE, RELIGI ON AND GYMNASTICS 347 manuscript . His new vision was based on an analysis of the American situation from a neo-Oragean viewpo int, although the influence of his wide mystical reading was also marke d. Frank saw in true Oragean fashion \"a unif orm people, an unconscious people, a people enslaved to the monotone of industrial 'advance ' which is the domination of things .\" To this he opposed his ideal nation composed of \"a conscious people, a varied and integral people, the symphonic nation in whom all selves adumbrate to whole ness. \" The whole troub le, he thought, lay in the fickl eness of the self. He took his stand on Gurd jieff's teaching of man's \"many I's.\" \"The usual 'self is a flashing and fu sing of wor ds, a flux of memories and behaviours split fr om the unity of life.\" No nation could be composed from such impermanent individua ls. In order to create a group, the individual first needed to reform himsel f. His argu ment was that which Munson had used a year earlier in Destinati ons . \"What is needed ,\" wrote Frank, \"is a method fo r achieving specific controls within us, as sure as the method of the modern chemis t.\" He debated Buddhism, Pythagoras, and the Cabala as disciplines fo r achieving self-knowledge and unity with the whole . \"The archaic methods are barred,\" he concl uded, \"for their values and ends are not ours.\" But America could learn fr om the East the \"applied science\" of which it stood in need. Frank then outlined a vague and inflated method fo r achieving what he called \"the image of wholene ss.\" He warn ed his readers that there were various dangers to the semi-mys tical practices which he recommended. As an example, he criticized the Method derived fr om Gu rdjieff, whose followers fo rmed the only \"Ea stern cult\" with which he had had conta ct. \"It is vitiated ,\" he wrote, \"by the doctrinal separation of the observing 'I' from �� observed organ ism.\" He ended by acknowledging \"my debt to Mr. Ora ge, whose dialectic stimulated me, often through disagr eement, to come to my own conclusi ons.\" Frank's more detailed critici sm of the Gurdjieff technique is very acute : he had in fact stumbled on the central trick of the Method and decided that � did not like the direction in which it was leading him. To those who remained in every sense disciples, this exhibition of -dare one say-f ree �ll, appeared as a return into mechanica lness. They began to accu se Frank Of plagiari zing Gurdjieff. Having come in he was now going out again ; but � and out from the point of view of a true believer. It was clear that he lnust be censured. \\' In 1930, the year after The Red iscovery of America was issued in book form, Gorham Munson published The Dilemma of the Liberated . In many ,Ways this was a covert reply to Frank' s apo stasy; but whereas Frank had �sed Orage's Method as a possible aid in his self-imposed task of constru � ting a distinctive \"American ness,\" Munson argued fr om current"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"348 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE intellectual questions to the necessity of the Method. The Oragean attitude appeared to him as a necessary outcome of the Huma nist philosophy propo unded by Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More. Munson opposed the Humanist position to the conventional attitudes of the Romantic. The Romantic \"resigns his Ego to his organ ism\" and \"like a child led by its nurse\" he travels along the road mapped out fo r him by nature. The logical end of this progress was Freud, whom Munson rather oddly saw as a prophet of sensuality. Munson addre ssed those attracted by Babbitt's doctr ines of \"restraint\" in tones which only a knowledge of the Work can discern as a sales pitch. \"The New Huma nist fe els that his real, deepest self is somewhat apart fr om his natural mechanical self. He wants to be the driver of his machine, not a mere intoxicated passenger in a runaway vehicle .\" The Humanists, Muns on fe lt, were obviously halfway to his own position. They appreciated the need for a salutary discipline; but they stopped short of taki ng the vital step. The liberated man would consider Humanism \\\\-i th sympathy, but his own aspirations were set on higher things. For the Humanists in the last resort were only \"pseudo-liber ated\". and-Qf course-­ they lacked a Method fo r developing the Will which was to exert the discipline they preac hed. Munson thought the Humanists had restricted \"the length of our teth er.\" His appeal would be fa miliar nowaday s, and in Europe the phrase, \"expansion of conscio usness ,\" had long been current in the society fr equented by Ouspensky and Orage . Munson put his \" d is­ agreea ble\" proposition in more homely terms. \"The Great Revolt will be the revolt against the limits of Humanism as new vistas of action , thought and being become discernible beyond the end of the tethe r. \" The real lesson was to be learned from \"the resol ute disposition of the genuinely religious to go to any lengths, if necessar y.\" A truly liberated human being was religious by definition . The Dilemma of the Liberated was an appeal to the man who had fr eed himself from convention and inheritance, but who had come to see that self­ indulgence was not the way out. In many ways it is a rem arkable book which would have been prophetic if it had been less shackled to the intellectual contr oversies of the time. As it stands, it is the attitude alone which remains prop hetic; and the attitude is derived almost entirely from Orage . The Dilemma of the Liberated is very much the sort of book Orage would have written if he had written sustained critic ism. It was Gurd jieff and Orage applied; a sort of public version of the appeal with which every teacher of the Gurd jieff ideas begins his campaign : \"What do you wan t?

Again the Oragean magic had convinced a group of intellectuals that art was not enough. Among them, Margaret Anderson leaves no doubt that it was Orage , rather than the \"baffling\" Gurdjieff, who initiated her into \"the art of life.\" When in 1925 she visited the Prieure, Gurd jieffwas still almost incommunicado, and Orage's adroit manipulation left her \"slightly hysterica l\"; \"I wanted to shake Orage and shout: tell me what it is you know that I don't! Next I wanted to weep, as a token of my admirati on.\" Instead they discussed her react ions, and Orage dangled before her the carrot of a less \"subjective\" state of being. Then he cross­ examined her on what she wanted from life: What is your object in playing the piano? As nearly as I can define it, playing the piano is the logical way to recapture continuously that state of ecstasy without which life is not worth liVing. That is not an object, corrected Orage . If you say you are playing the piano to make money or to give concert tours you have named objects. And then he added the five words that have changed my outlook upon life: Act, said Orage , don't be acted upon. * * * * I saw Orage again. This time he said seven words : Remember you're a pianist and not a piano. Orage 's influence was also the deciding factor fo r Jane Heap. In 1926, after visiting the Prieure several times, she allowed space in The Little Review for a rather heavy-handed article by Orage called \"A Theatre fo r UB ,\" in which Orage described Gurd jieff's theory of the three centers of man . ••.•.. Orage added that he did not undertake to write a Gurd jieffian play, but � would go to see it. It is small wonder that his English friends considered that his judgment had faltered ; fo r if they took this covert piece of � aganda at its face value, they must have formed a poor opinion of ' f)rage's artistic standard s. Literature and art had been completely subordi­ ated to the world view of Gurdjieff; and the appearance of this article in �he Little Review-the magaz ine of all the little maga zines which most �xalted the role of the artist-shows clearly how the artist was coming to ill strust his own most cherished illusions. The article speaks \"as an intelligent to the intellig ent,\" it addressed an \"in-gro up,\" and with hindsight it appears as the forerunner of The Little Review's capitulation to the pressure of the times and Orage's remorseless logic."},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"350 THE HA8MONIOUS CIRCLE During the years 1928--30, Margaret Anderson and Georgette Leblanc lived in a lighthou se at Tancar ville in Normandy and wrote their memoirs. Georgette Leblanc admitted that her Maeterlinck and I was an act of exor cism, but Margaret Anderson's My Thirty Years War was equally an attempt to annihilate the past by comprehending it. \"Ea ch day,\" wrote the creator of Mel isande, \"I fe el that I leave myself a little more, the better to go towards my encounter with myself. \" The fo under of The Little Review put it more simply: \"I am trying to become a new human being .\" Then at last Jane Heap agreed with Margaret Anderson that The Little Review must end. All their strivings and aspirations had become transmuted. Their attention had passed through the glass of art and fixed itself on the view beyond the window. Margaret Anderson returned to her magazine to write a last editorial in the spring of 1929. She had begun The Little Review, she wrote , because she \"wanted an intelligent life.\" Only the very best artists could give her this lif e; and so she created a maglU:ine fo r them. But now she had come to the concl usion that \"even the artist doesn't know what he is talking abo ut. And I can no longer go on publishing a magazine in which no one really knows what he is talking about. It doesn't interest me.\" She could imagine only one sort of magazine which would be interesting to publish, one which would be \"about people .\" Only, don't let me hear any more about \"it's the artist who transf orms life.\" I know it. But I'm not particularly interested at the moment in transf ormation . I want a little illumiI).ation. Of course I won't start that other kind of review. I wouldn't really have the patience: everyone becomes too angry when expert opinion is brought to bear upon his pretenc es, his satisf action in living the human cliche s. It would take years to get down to a little decent discuss ion of the world psyche. In the meantime I shall search psychological conversation . Jane Heap's farew ell was less tumultuous and more concerned with the artist's predica ment. Headed, \"Lost: a Renaissance ,\" it recalled that The Little Review had been the standard-bearer of \"the revolution in the arts, begun before the war.\" Hope of this renaissance had faded, she wrote, just as the hope of a better world after Armageddon had vanished soon after the signing of the Versailles peace.

There was one obvious difference: the Gurd jieff discipline promised a way of escape fo r individua lists.

In all this we have not brought forward anything approa ching a masterpiece except the \"Ulysses\" of Mr. Joyce .... Self-expre ssion is not enough; experiment is not enough; the recording of special moments or cases is not enough. All of the arts have broken fa ith or lost connection with their origin and functi on. They have ceased to be concerned with the legitimate and permanent material of art. I have not come to this opinion hastily nor through any habitual pessimism, but only after years of observa t ion, reval uing, and learning. I hold no disappo intment, despair, or fe ars fo r the future. I hold no negative emotions. The actual situation of art today is not a very important or adult concern (Art is not the highest aim of man); it is interesting only as a pronounced symptom of an ailing and aimless society . This is the situation as I see it. My \"luminous certitude\" that it could be changed made of me a victim of the Little Review .... In spite of logic, deprivat ions, financial catastrophies and Mr. Sumner, we have gone on running the Little Review: or I thought I had until I fo und that it was running me.

The final number of The Little Review in which these editorials appeared is an extra ordinary document. The bulk of the issue was taken up by the re plies made by past contributors to a questionnaire sent them by the edit ors. This was an adaptation of the standard questionnaire which Orage gave to his pupils as a preliminary exercise in self-know ledge; and the editors printed a letter from Orage which correctly prophesied the sort of llDSW ers they recei ved: I doubt whethe r you will get any sincere answers to these questions. After all, the stuff of the answers is the stuff of which \"literature\" is the disguise-and as your questioners are mainly literary, they will naturally preserve their private capital .

The contributors divided themselves into several factions: those like Picasso and Shaw who were too busy and eminent to reply; rumbustious corre spondents like Ben Hecht and Richard Aldington who took the questions at their face value, and others who filled in the answers in an exce ss of humor (some of the jokes were quite good : Ques tion-Why would you not change places with anyone ?-Allen Tanner: \"Ah, because I am myself and intensely under my influence\"); a group which included Andre Gide and Aldous Huxley who caught some idea of the underlying intention; and the Little Review set who were pupils of Orage and Gurdjieff and wrote in the private language of their ideas. Of these some, like Munson, answered in the Oragean mode. Why should he make strangers privy to his dearly bought self-knowledge? Others, like Solita Solano and Georgette Lebla nc, answered straig htfor­ wardly that they wanted to be \"more consci ous\" human beings, and the rest of their answers fo llowed acco rding to the canon. There was an astoundingly sophis ticated-and Gurdj ieffian-reply fr om Fritz Peters, aged fifteen. Mark Turbyfill contributed a dolorous lament fo r his will-less \"puppet­ hood .\" Gertrude Stein was more than usually enigmatic (\"Jane, Jane come away let the garden come and stay came late to stay in the morning came late to stay the first day in the evening\"). Margaret Anderson regarded the answers as confirmation that even artists did not know what they were doing. Jane Heap announced that she had fo und her own answers to some of the questions and that these provided the best reason for abandoning art. But none of the really eminent contributors fo llowed suit. The real creators- those who were still convinced that they could in fact create-­ remained unmoved by the arguments about the necessi ty of going \"beyond ar t.\" The critics were drawn to Orage by intellectual honesty; the minor writers perhaps because they lacked the final obsessive conviction which drove the greater art ists. It was those who had been defeated by the 1920s who joined the Oragean caucu s. The release experienced by the intelleCtual who discards his rigor ous standards is often of an intensely emotional nature ; and the devotion which Orage inspired was more than a little relig ious . To Herbert Croly, Gurd jieff's approach seemed to provide the contemporary philosopher's stone, the union of religion and science. During 1925 and 1926, his New Republic editorials made frequent concealed ref erence to Orage's tech­ nique, and Croly moved into the open with his article \"Religion as"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"ART, SCIEN CE, RELIGI ON AND GYMNA STICS 353 Metho d,\" of June 30, 1926. \"The only trustworthy knowledge of God,\" he declare d, \"is derived from a kind of contemplation which includes and combines the results of mystical experience and scientific method .\" He distinguished two possible ways of \"being aware .\" The first-in which the \"individual organ ism\" was supposed to deepen its contacts with the \"total environment\"-is related to the \"method\" of Waldo Frank . The second was simply the Method as taught by Ora ge. Croly himself seems not to have pursued his discipline to the end. Perhaps the vacillation between Frank's mysticism and the Method which can be seen in his writings of 1926 shows that he never committed himself wholeheartedly to Orage and Gurd jieff . In 1928 he had a stroke which Robert Morse Lovett, in his own book, All Our Years, connects with his practice of the Gurd jieff Method. The same year the New Republic published Waldo Frank's The Rediscovery of America; and when the work was issued in book fo rm in 1929, it bore a fulsome dedication to Croly, whose association with the renegade Frank indicates that he had at last decided agai nst Orage . \"Croly was a fa stidious man,\" writes Edmund Wilson, \"and in the long run he fo und Orage grat ing. \" The fo under of the New Republic died in 1930, by which time Orag e's authority in intellectual circles was in any case on the wane. However, Croly's hope fo r a scientific religion was shared by committed Oragea ns. Jane Heap was fo nd of emphasizing the technical aspect of the discipline; in Orage 's words, it was \"a technique of techniq ues .\" Margaret Anderson makes fr equent references to \"the Gurdjieff science .\" The best apology fo r the scientific attitude of Gurd jieff's approach was made by the recorder of The Oragean Ver sion, Charle s Daly King. In 1927, at the height of Orage's succ ess. Daly King published a short book called Beyond Behaviorism under the pseudonym of Robert Court­ ney. It begins with an acknowl edgment to Orage and a dedication \"to my old friend and frequent companion, M. N. Eddin\" -the Mullah Nasr Eddin whose unconventional drolleries pepper the pages of Beelzebub's Tales . Th e Orage groups considered the book to be their justification in terms of contemporary psychology. Psychoana lysis was not worthy of their steel; it was merely another product of the Western life of illusions, but Behavior­ ism and its leading popular prophet, Dr. John B. Watson, were other matt ers. If men were no better than Pavlov's dogs and if psychology must confine its attentions to recording observable behavior, the position of Western man might seem more hopeless than ever. This was where the Oragean stepped in. Of course, man is mechanical , ran the argu ment; of course, he is conditioned by physique, inheritance, and educat ion: but t here is a way out . . . Like Croly, Daly King saw the Met hod as a possible junction of religion"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"354 THE HA RMONIOUS CIRCLE and science. He began with the parable of the emergence of the butterHy from the chrysa lis. In the course of his argu ment, this comparison was applied to the new men who were to emerge fr om the old automatic men, and to the new science which was to spring from the ashes of the old. Daly wanted \"bigger and better men\" as the only possible solution to the probl ems of industrial society. Presently, so it is said, within a fe w generati ons, we shall face a bankruptcy of brains that will cause our fo od and water supplies to become uncertain, epidemics to sweep our crowded cities, and our who le, vast, complicated fabric of life to decompose in such a welter of blood and misery as the world has never seen. He accepted many of the Behavio rists' argu ments, but these merely increased the sense of hopele ssness. \"Is our civilization doomed?\" This question was dismissed as too vast fo r individual consideration . The individual must therefore concentrate on hims elf. Religion s-which had held out the hope of a soul only if a man worked to obtain it-had degenerated into mere altruism. \"As if, fo rsooth , by a figurative enlarge­ ment of the visceral system a man could become a god !\" Daly shaded the desperate situation of humanity in the darke st possible tones. If religions and psychologies provided no solution , where could the inquirer find hope? At this point he introduced the idea of self-o bser vati on. \"Her e,\" he announce d, \"we have the very secret itself!\" \"That T am indeed a thing distinct fr om my body (or any or all of its functioning parts) is evident fr om the fact that it is possible for T to observe its behaving body with completely impersonal non-ident ificati on.\" The practice of this method would result in the metamorphosis of the human butterfly . \"This method is the technique of techn iques. If we can make progre ss with this, all other proc esses, from play-wri ting to carpentering, will become ipso fa cto much easier fo r us to mast er.\" The summer after he had published Beyond Behaviorism, Daly-now with a degree in psychology- went to Calif ornia as assistant to Dr. William M. Marston, under whom he had studied at Columbia. Here he worked with Marston in developing the system of \"Int egrative Psychology .\" Marston's position was that, although the Behavio rists were correct in attempting to measure only what was measurable , this did not mean that the phenomena of consciousness should be exclu ded from t he province of psychology. He argued that Behaviorism was a valid branch of physiology and not part of psychology at all. His own theory was that consciousness was what he called \"psychonic energy\" which resulted from the functioning of syna pses in the brain."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"ART, SCIEN CE, RELIGION AND GYMNASTICS 355 Daly collaborated with his fo rmer teacher in various papers and a book on the theory of Integrative Psychology . From his point of view, the most important aspect of Marston's work was that it rescued the phenomena of consci ousness from the Behaviori sts, who had tried to exclude the topic from all academic considerati on. He set to work to incorporate this helpful new approach within the structure of the Method. The result was another book, The Psychology of Consciousness, published in 1932. This is \"a much more detail ed, technical and expanded version\" of Beyond Behaviorism . Gone are the literary conceits of the purely Oragean work ; gone are the mou rnful reflections on approach ing doom. In their place is a closely argued justification for the method of self-observation . The first part of the book contains a critique of Behaviori sm and other schools of psychology . It ends with an outline of Marston's ideas. Having restored consci ousness to the center of att ention, Daly parades across the field the question of the \"I.\" He then pounces on the defects which he finds in all the current theories of the nature of the \"I\"-the soul-theory, the mind-t heory and the body-theory\" with all their variati ons. Then once more, taking care to distinguish it fr om \"the fa llacy of introspect ion,\" he produces like a rabbit from a hat, the Method of Gurd jieff and Orage . Daly King's description of the technique of self-observation is taken directly fr om the material which he had derived fr om Orage and later published in The Oragean Versio n. The importance of The Psychology of Consciousness is that it provides a rational just ification fo r the proces s-and a superficially impressive one. Daly liked to claim that self-observation was \"the only extant proposal fo r psychology which is at the same time both scientific and psychological .\" Somewhat natural ly, there is no evidence that .he derived any support from the psychologists at whom he directed his ar guments; they were likely to be wedded either to the physiological or the philosophical scho ols. What he was proposi ng-and it must have seemed all the more extra ordinary to readers who knew nothing of Gurd jieff or Orage-was an activity neither philosophical nor physiological, but which .� claimed as truly scientific. The defects of his book are obvious enough: there is a suggestion of cultishness, and topics which only an Oragean would consider relevant intrude into the discussion. But The Psychology of Consciousness is an astonishing proof that it is possible to argue strongly fo r the \"scientific\" status of the discipline brought to Eur ope and America by a man popularly considered as a crank and a charlat an. By the end of · the 1920s there had grown up a distinctive \"Oragean\" standpoi nt. No one could claim that this had much influence outside a small Circle; but it was an honest -at times a painfully honest -atte mpt to come to terms with reality . If detached critics like Edmund Wilson could see the"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"356 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE attitu des of the early 1920s as outworn by the end of the decade, the situation L r those who had been most deeply involved in that hopeful rebellion was both more personal and more desperate . The Augustan critic could call fo r new soluti ons; but to romantics who had experienced the poverty of their own fo rmer attit udes, there were few courses open in a sceptical wor ld. Munson saw the year 1929 as a turning point fo r the twe nties generati on. He pointed to the final number of The Little Review, to the appearance of books like Walter Lippmann's A Pre face to Morals and Joseph Wood Krutch's The Modern Temper, which recogn i zed the prevail­ ing atmosphere of blighted hopes a n d called fo r new standar ds. Krutch's book was influential in its day, and despite Mu nson's subpoena on its argu ments, these were in one place directed at the weakest spot in the Oragean armor. It is difficult to believe that Krutch did not have the Orageans in mind when he analyzed the pressures making fo r a new religiosity. He detected a general belief in a discontinuity between the human and the natural wor ld. If this belief ever came to be accepted, he wrote , the door into the unseen world would be open once more and religion might well flourish quite as luxuriantly as it did in fo rmer times. But Krutch saw a basic implausibility in this attitu de. It was really a \"philosophy of the 'as if. '\" \"We may reasonably doub t,\" he wrote, \"whether men can actually live by any fa ith so tenuous .\" He saw two results of the flight into materiali sm: to win fo r the old creeds a small number of troub lesomely vacillating recru its; and considerably to increase the number of people interested in metaphy sics considered rath er as a game than as a means of arriv ing at truths relevant to the life in which we live . It is noticeable that most of the Orageans came to their discipline-or at least argued in support of it-f rom despair. There was no hope . Therefore they would try a more hop eful path . This approach seems very much a \"philosophy of the 'as if,'\" and however Orage had begun his spiritual journey fr om the office in Chancery Lane , such an attitude of willed acceptance did come to dominate his rela tionship to the Work . In his posthumously published The Active Mind, he makes a plea fo r adopting the Gurd jieffian point of view in an essay called \"Life as Gymnasti cs.\" Can we alter our attitudes at will? asks Orage . If we establish control over our emotions, we can fe el about any event as we pleas e. Any \"met hod aiming towards betterment\" must start by corre cting the attitude to life. \"What is our imagination of life? What do we take it to be? fs it a coiled rope or a snake? It may prove in the end impossible to know fo r certain what life is; but in that case, we are free to imagine it to be something use fu l to us.\" Orage suggested that \"in the present epoch the image of life .as a gymnasium is a greatly needed toni c.\" The gymnasium, he reminded his"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"ART, SCI ENe E, R ELI G ION AND GYM N A S TI C S 357 readers, had been the symbol of life itself fo r the Pythago reans, \"whose God ran this planet as a gymnasium for the exercise of men.\" It is difficult to see in what other direction we moderns can look fo r a new image and therefore attitude towards life. We have no longer the possibility of religion in the traditional sense. Ordinary goodness-in the sense of doing what others call good-has no intelligent appeal . And after the still recent Great War, the belief in prog ress is superstition. But the clean, strong, idea of life as a field of exercise fo r the development of all our muscle s-physical, emotional and intellec­ tual-has still the unspoiled quality of manly or womanly idea lism. And lif e lived in that attitude would certai nly be interesting as well as profita ble. Was the whole fabric of Oragean intellectual ism built on so fr agile a fo undati on? If the teacher were playing a role not out of an overriding sense of personal conviction but fo r the sake of encouraging a \"right attitude\" toward life-t hen perhaps this attitude was all that was taught? Or was Orag e's almost cynical point of view an act of superrea lism? There is no indication when he wrote \"Life as Gymnastics\" but it is probable that he grew toward these opinions as his association with Gurdjieff progre ssed. So far we have seen Orage as the pupil-teacher , the figurehead , the Master in his own right. We have ignored the progr ess of the actor behind the role. He can no longer be neglected, fo r in 1929 Gurd jieff once more appeared in New York, and Orag e's very ability to perf orm his task was ca lled into question . Two years later Orage left America to the mercy of Gurd jieff and �. Depression. The circumstances of this parting can be interpreted in many different ways; sometimes, it seems, in several different ways at once. Time, taught Orage , fo llowing Ouspensky, is \"the potentiality of experi­ ence.\" In The Active Mind, he wrote : \"Time as succession is simply the �alisation of one possibility out of each successive moment. Could we � alise two possibilities, or three or fo ur at once, we should be living in two or three or four different stream s of time.\" Go back to his introduc­ � n-the division of reality into the Actual and Potential . In terms of time, :n ending our potentiality must have something to do with simult aneity ... me re are so many possibilities. . . ."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"9 The Domi nion of Heropass \"The Heropass\"-or to give the process its fu ll fe arsome title, \"our ALL­ COMMON MASTER THE MERCILESS HEROPASS \" -was Gurd jieff's term fo r the flow of time. Unlike many of the words he used in Beelzebub's Tales, the meaning is easily guessed. For Gurdjieff hims elf, fo r his leading follow ers, and fo r their pupils also, the years 1929-34 were a period of great change s. Perhaps these resulted from the natural effects of the passage of time. Perhaps they arose from an artificial disturbance in it. Orage's letters to Jean Toomer provide a good index of his changing attit udes. On January 5, 1926, he wrote to Toom er enclosing :'the remaining\" chapters of THE BOOK. There was one section still unwritt en, and the conc lusion of the chapter on Art had to await Orage's return to Font ainebleau . Gurd jieff did not propose to publish the first series of his writings until the second and third were complete in Russian and English transla tion. You will see that the Greek Kalends will come first! However it is nothing to us personally; and in fact, it is something of a privilege to be able to prepare an understanding of the book before (if ever) it is published ....

Orage wrote that he was starting a group fo r all previous members of his and Toomer:s groups, and had already begun one for newc omers. There was a third group to occupy his atte ntion; but even with some income coming from these sources he was hard pressed. \"I already see,\" he wro te, \"that it will leave me fa r too short a time to worse than was te. In short, I must have something to do that will be profitab le. \" When he left Fontainebleau around Christmas time, he had given Gurd jieff 500 dollars of his own money. \"The Prieure was in debt, Gurd jieff had not a penny and nothing had arri ved. . . . Financing the importunate Gurd jieff was almost the chief subject of the corre spondence between Orage and Too mer. Sometimes we may suspect Orage of passing on to his junior colleague the pressures which were put on him; but although a measure of acting may intrude into the situati on, there is no doubt of the incessant demands made by the Prieure. By late spring 1926, the question arose of Too mer's becoming responsible fo r the publication of Beelzebub's Tales . In May, Orage wrote putting at his disposal 3,000 dollars , if this should arise. This seems to have been in return fo r Too mer's releasing appro ximately that sum fr om the publication fund established with Mabel Luhan 's donati on. This sum fo und its way to Gurd jieff and his administrators , but it did not support the Prieure fo r long. On November 12, 1926, after Toomer had left the Prieure fo r Chicago, Orage wrote fr om Fontainebleau telling him how much Gurd jieff had 8: pp reciated his \"parting present\" of money. This seems to have consisted of an other 2,000 dollars from the printing fund, of which some had already been given to Gurd jieff and some was promised; and Orage wondered anxi ously: \"God knows how you are going to make up to the printing fund the $2,000 you have given to G. but I presume that you like, as I do, � mething to work agai nst. \" He then tightened the screws furthe r. � An yhow, it went very quick, and just as a dog soon learns where he last got meat and expecting returns fo r more without enquiring how it got there, G . . and Mme.

He wrote that Gurd jieff proposed to go to Dijon \"to ,Consult about fo rmat, etc.\" He advised Too mer \"to begin at the beginning �d only to 'rustle' the book at first, Get along with the elements, just as you did in your New York group-and in the meanwhi le, create an interest 'in the book by seldom speaking of it. Then a little later, as a special favour, you might consent to reading the chapters to groups specially collected and, as it were, privileged .\" Orage wrote that jessie Dwight, Jane Heap, and"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"360 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Elizabeth Gordon had left fo r New York to take temporary charge of his own groups. He himself had evidently had to stay to work on Beelzebub's Tales . There creeps into his letters a hint of frustration and the suspicion that Gurdjieff is \"holding out\" on him. I still am not sure of my return to New York at Christma s-but I hope to go, and to find much new material ready to my hand. All the same, my fe et get very cold occas ionally when I think of beginning groups all over a g ain- because I doubt whether the \"ancient\" groups would profit us or themselves by more attenti on. During late November and early December Orage wrote several times bemoaning Gurd jieff's slow progress on THE BOOK and trying to squeeze money out of the unfortunate Toomer. Gurdjieff \"quite expects the remainder of your nest-egg at any mome nt.\" He \"looks for the post, so to speak , in expectation of 'America send cheque, finish $2,OOO !!!' as Beelzebub would say.\" On December 6, Orage announced his own return to New York where he hoped to be useful in attra cting income; \"and certainly I do not consider any money too high to pay-if only we can get it!\" From his letters to Chicago in the early part of 1927, it is clear that Orage was becoming increasingly impatient of Gurd jieff's incessant demands. His appeals during the previous months may have been an attempt to persuade Too mer to overcom mit himself so that he should have \"somet hing to work against\"; but in New York he was once again himself in the firing line. On January 17, he wrote that \"things are not going with a mighty flourish here either. The wind has dropped a good deal since last June .... How ever, the work is to go on as if circumstances were completely favourable . . .\" The depression was only mome ntary and on February 11, he reported that, \"with a good deal of effo rt,\" the situation has improved. \"Like a fool\" he had sent more of his own money to Gurdji eff-and during the spring of 1927 the financial situation continued to dominate his corre spondence. Gurdjieff is really quite extraordinary about money-but not, unfor­ tunately, unique; we've known many people at college and in life equally extraord inary .

His warning was not in time to prevent Too mer succu mbing to the plaintive demands of the Prieure; and on April 8, Orage was writing again : \"I still think you should have resisted the appeal.

At the end of May he wrote that he had personally sent 2,500 dollars since January, and that he was having trouble making ends meet. He had been fo rced to turn a deaf ear to a cable appealing for more. The Prieure would have to take summer visitors to make up its cornucopian budget, and it was now that Orage held out to Gurd jieff the prospect of American disciples paying 100 dollars each . Apart fr om the financial consideration s, Orage' s letters of early 1927 betray a certain uneasiness at his position in New York; an uneasiness which stemmed from the same sources as had made him doubt whether his groups would really benefit fr om his return in the winter of 1926. In February he was writing to Toomer-perhaps in an attempt to rally his spirits -\"I tremble to anticipate each succe eding week. If I don't make the ideas inte resting, the group would fa ll flat, but if I make them too interesting, the group would fall flatter, perhaps would never rise. G.'s noose-dance is no joke!\" In early April his mood was of resigned determination ; the sigh and the setting of the jaw can almost be heard : It is not plain sailing to interpret G.; and I'm usually in despair before the lecture and in a state of self-disgust after it. All the expr essed admiration in the world doesn't affect my feelings. At the same time I'm glad to be up against anything so impossible and intrig uing. ()p May 12, soon before the summer recess, his mood was even blac ker. <'I'm prof oundly dissatisfied with my atte mpts to get anywhere near the bottom of the damned BOOK. \" The summer of 1927 was significant fo r Orage's rela tionship with Gurdjieff. Instead of traveling to the Prieure with the main influx of su mmer visitors, he and Jessie Dwight went on holiday in Canada with the .Daly Kings. That August Orage sailed fo r France alone, and stayed at .Fontai nebleau for ten days, then returned to New York . Soon after his arrival-Qn September 24--he and Jessie Dwight were marr ied. Some Orageans noticed that their leader became less acce ssible after his �arriage . This was only natural, but it shows how Orage's priorities had begun to alter. His essay \"On Love\" was written while Jessie Dwight was at the Prieure in 1924, and it marks an important point in the development of"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"362 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE his ideas. The essay is based upon Gurd jieff's teac hing about the three kinds of love: instinctive, emotional, and consc ious. Instinctive love is a matter of chemistry or biology. Emotional love is an aberration . Conscious love-rarely if ever attained-is the only true fo rm of loving. A conscious lover works on himself in order to help the loved one: \"If I am not sure what ,is proper to her perf ection, let her at least have free way to fo llow her own bent. Mea nwhile , to study -what she is, and may become; what she needs, what her soul craves and cannot find a name, still less a thing for. To anticipate today her needs of tomorrow . And without a thought all the while of what her needs may mean to me. \" The attitude is the same as Katherine Mansfield's when she planned to describe a \"con test of lovi ng. \" \"On Love \" takes up the idea, develops it, and applies it to the author's own situati on. Orage 's embarkation on a phase of happy fa mily life was the natural outcome of this attitude; and it marked the end of his total dependence on Gurdjieff. But he was by no means fr ee of his Master yet; and Gurd jieff knew it. The Orages sailed again fo r Fontainebleau on New Year's Eve 1927. When they arrived in France, Gurd jieff kissed Jessie Orage , declaring that she was half his now, whether she liked it or not. Mrs. Orage's relat ionship with Gurd jieff was ambival ent. She had first gone to the Prieure only at her husband's express urging, and although she took a leading part in the typing and translation of Beelzebub's Tales , she also stubbornly went her own way. She overrode Gurd jieff's rather schoolmasterly \"rules\" and avoided the tasks which more conscientious converts fulfilled. So, fo r exam ple, when all the other pupils removed their shoes for the movements in the Study House, �he left hers outside the building so as not to be seen recovering them when she slipped away . Gurdjieff seems to have respected her attitu de, and his eye was lasciviously fixed on her. After one occasion on which she evaded his invitation to his flat in Paris, Gurd jieff discovered her reading letters fr om Ora g e, and promptly issued an edict that all mail was to pass through his hands. She was alway s more detached fr om the Work than her husband. Her independence grated on some of Gurd jieff's followers . When Gurd jieff introduced his idiot toas ts, Mrs. Orage was put in the \"squirming id i ot\" category; and Alexa nder de Salzmann once burst out in exasperation, \"If you'd only admit that you're a squirming idiot, what a marvellous initiate you'd be!\" From one angle it seems as though Gurd jieff resented her claims on Orage and exerted himself to be unpleasant. Once, when 'the couple were returning fr om France to the tlnited State s, they went to say goodbye to the Master at the Cafe de la Paix. \"Did you ever hear of a man called Y?\" asked Gurd jieff (it had been Mrs,.. Y who threw herself out of the boa rding house window) . \"His wife make trouble fo r me. She commit suicide .\" The"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"DOMINI ON OF HEROPASS 363 reference was to a real suicide, known as such, and the impact on Gurd jieff's listeners was horrific. But was the remark dictated by jealousy and self-interest-or was this another \"shock\" administered fo r the Orag es' benefit? If Jessie Dwight had resented Gurd jieff's influence over Orage, as Jessie Orage she resented it still more. In the days before they were married Gurd jieff went out of his way to underline his ascendancy over his \"super­ idiot\"; and afterward he placed great strains on the relati onship. Once in the early days Gurd jieff and the Orages were touring in Gurdji eff's car on a chaotic journey with typewriters and picnic baskets. Gurd jieff discovered a fo ur-day-old jar of caviar among his provisions and gave it to Orage to finish. To Jessie Dwight's annoyance, Orage meekly ate some of the decrepit cont ents, and Gurdjieff underlined his victory with an airy : ''I'll give the rest to Lady Rothermere .\" An incident fr om the winter of 1927 -28 illustrates Gurd jieff's continual goading. The scene was the dining room of the Prieure, with Orage seated on Gurd jieff's left. The \"introduction of the noble French armagnac\" into the syste ms of the diners had been rather more concentrated than usual. A pupil who was present remembers a commotion around Gurd jieff which resolved itself into the Master dangling a small object which he had snatche d-probably a watch or a locket belonging to Jessie Orage . Orage , says the pupil, had a \"tiger-like\" look on his face and sat watc hing Gurd jieff play with the obj ect he had captured with \"polite patience .\" Suddenly, he pounced to recover the locke t; but Gurdjieff-al though he was supposed to be very drunk -was even quicker, and whisked his prize away from Orage 's lunge. I', This acting-or was it acting? -increasingly determined the relationship �ee n the Orages and their Master. Gurd jieff grew increasingly impossible, and the final straw was a terrify ing experience when the couple were leaving Paris fo r New York in February 1928. Gurd jieff transfixed Jessie Orage with his gaze . He seemed to immobilize her, and she could not breat he; fo r a moment she was �v inced that he was going to make her lose consciousness altoget her. Then he spoke: \"If you keep my super-idiot from coming back to me, you �rn in boiling oil.\" Orage had gone to sleep. But he was finally persuaded !'t his wife's insistence that this time Gurd jieff had gone too far. It was the �t visit he ever paid to Fontainebleau , and the Orages saw nothing of � rdjieff fo r almost a year. �;i:' From the spring of 1928, they were back in the United States, and in the t� summer, Orage wrote two letters to Too mer which refer clearly to the , ' cial extre mities in which Gurd jieff fo und himse lf and his own new . etachm ent from the demands of Fontainebleau . \"I have a fe eling that � ething will happen to the Prieure this summer,\" he wrote on May 5."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"364 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE \"Su pplies are really short . . . the situation is slated fo r drastic change ; and I should have liked one of us-and not me-to be there to witness it.\" Just over a month later another resigned letter arrived in Chicago . \"I suppose you can't contribute immediately and substa ntially towards the sum of $10,0 00 which G. has called fo r? No? Well, anyhow, I send the S.O.S.\" In the middle ofJune 1928, the Orages left for Calif ornia via Taos, and in the autumn Orage tried to start groups in San Francisco . But after two months of effort his audience was only thirty or fo rty fo r a weekly group, and by the end of October, he decided that it would take six months to arouse any general interest. He had heard of Jean Toomer's renewed literary ambitions and wrote that he was \"reviving my own intere st strangely enoug h.\" He proposed a competition to see whether he or Too mer could make more money by writing before June the fo llowing year. This is extremely significant, fo r next year (1929) Toomer was to write the memorandum which might-if Transatlantic had been succes sful-have signaled his emergence fr om the Work . In the event, Toomer returned to Chicago reflecting that there he had left \"his fo rm.\" Orage now had a fo rm-a marria ge-apart fr om and even antag onistic to the Gurd jieff ideas, and to this he held. He was clearly beginning to feel that he had been in long enough; and that it was time to come out . Perhaps Gurd jieff had some inkling of this. Certainly he knew that the 10,000 dollars fo r which he had asked had not arrive d. The only solution was a personal trip to New York. Gurd jieff arrived in New York on January 23, 1929. Three days late r, Orage informed Too mer: \"As you can guess, G.'s main purpose in being here is money; and he wants $10,0 00 within three weeks .\" He himself was suggesting privately to several people that they borrow 10,000 dollars to provide \"this colossal amount .\" The Master was in top fo rm. \"G. is more himself than ever -that is to say, he is more impossible than ever. But certainly New York needed a shaking up; and I too must have needed it. ... \" Five days later, Orage wrote again to suggest that Too mer use the idea of financing the publication of Beelzebub's Tales as an excuse fo r levying contributi ons. The New York groups were nearly mutinou s. \"We are all making a specia l-and fo r most-final effort.\" By the middle of the month Toomer had decided to come to New York, and Orage told him that he would be \"twice welcome bearing gifts .\" He was to raise 1,00 0 dollars in Chicago \"so to say, as security fo r your return to Chicago with G.'s fresh material , et c.\" Apparently Orage was still prepared to absorb the shock of Gurd jieff's demands into the attitude of the Work. On April 22, after Gurd jieff's departure fo r France, he wrote to Toomer that a monthly sum had been guaranteed him from the New York groups. \"I find myself no end pepped up by G.' s visit; and I'm SlIre you find yourself the same. He got his 'roses,' I may say .. . \""},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"DOMI NION OF HEROPASS 365 So had the letter writer; but in a different sense. On April 5, 1929, Gurd jieff had sailed fo r France . After the ship moved out, Orage danced fo r joy on the quay. \"Thank God I'm free again!\" he said. A fo rtnight later his first child, Richard, was born, and this all but set the seal on his liberation fr om the Master. Orage's personal interests were expanding again. In 1929 he began to conduct a writing clas s and revived his own literary efforts. He collected short passages of critici sm fr om the New Age and published them with a fe w more recent essays under the title, The Ar t of Reading . One of the New Age articles he reprinted was an assault on the inadequacies of rationa lism; and the final essa y in the book advocated a return to the cultural standards of ancient India. Such ideas recalled the position he had occupied in pre­ Gurd jieff days; the days of T. E. Hulme and his return to the irrational during the Great War. They were not likely to strike any chord in his reade rs. Orage was staunchly out-of -date ; and when The Art of Reading was published in the summer of 1930, the reviews showed it. There was general approval of Orage 's critical powers , but many reviewers began to ask what all the fu ss had been abo ut. C. H. Grattan in The Nation expre ssed the prevail ing disillusionment: \"A. R. Orage has a vast reputation fo r prof un­ dity, and indeed is more than a literary critic in the eyes of his intimate s: he is a sage . But I fa il to see what it is that so interests our Columbuses of the spirit, fo r I can find nothing in the man except an Englishman who happens to be a fa irly interesting criti c.\" The fe eling that the Orage bubble had burst was expre ssed even more powerf ully when Farrar and Rinehart issued his Psychological Exercises in the autumn. Again it was The Nation which was most deflatin g: This book ends a mystery in none too impressive a fa shion. It reveals just what Mr. Orage's initiates meant when they spoke of his '; psychological exerc ises .\" For a long time those who have stood apart from the Orage fu ror have imagined that these were something pretty impressive, but now anyone can consult this book and find that they are no more rema rkable than cross-word puzz les, anagram s, and other parlor games that involve a certain literacy . One can imagine idle people having fun with Mr. Orage 's exer cises, but they won't one fears, become much wiser in consequence. By the time . these unflattering notices were published, Orage had ,li.eturned to England. Before he left, he had to submit to one last invasion , b y Gurd jieff , who landed in New York on February 15, 1930. His arrival h ad been announced in two ambiguously worded cables . One- which had 'probably been edited by a member of Gurd jieff's entourage -read :"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"366 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE BREMEN BRINGS THOUSAND KILOS DISILLUSION; HUNDRED KILOS MOMEN­ TARY HAPPINESS, AND TEN POUNDS RETRIBUTI ON.

Orage wrote to Nott that Gurd jieff was once more in search of funds, \"though I doubt whether this time he will get much. His coming has, of course, bust up my group meetings and left me desperately placed fo r income, but I must be 'clev er,' I suppose and find a substitute .\" At the end of May, he closed his meetings and left fo r England with his wife and son, intending to spend the next six months writing fo r American magaz ines. He told Nott that he would not hold \"any groups wha tsoe ver, \" and it is difficult to avoid the impression that one reason fo r the trip was to avoid the pressures imposed by Gurd jieff's presence in New York. The fa mily settled near Rye in Sussex, and although the writing went badly , Orage spent the summer and autumn unmolested by Beelzebub and his importunities. But by the beginning of December 1930, Orage 's indecisions had again propelled him across the Atla ntic. Gurd jieff's own acco unt of his break with Orage is contained in the first chapter of his privately published Third Series . Although there are several typescript versions of this chapter in circulat ion, the outline of events is not in doubt. Gurd jieff begins by recalling the circumstances of his \"accide nt,\" and the closing of the Institute at Fontainebleau. This, he writes, dispersed his pupils throughout Europe, and many of them became teachers of his 'ideas in order to support them selves. Because they were insufficiently prepar ed, this merely increased the misund erstandings which already existed abo ut him. Eventually, he concluded that all the various groups which had grown up while he was writing his book had becom'.: more or less insane. Gurdjieff claims that when he arrived in America on November 13, 1930, he saw from the faces of his reception committee that they too had developed this fo rm of mad ness. The Americans had become concerned exclUSively with a small part of his teaching on self-observati on, which was itself a very preliminary exerci se. Acco rdingly, Gurdjieff write s, tongue almost projecting from cheek, he reversed an earlier de't:ision to exempt Orage's pupils-to whose contributions he already owed so much-from the sheep-shearing which was the purpose of his expediti on. Gurd jieff then recalls how he summoned five of the leading members of the New York groups to a confidential meeting. He told them that as he had now finished the first book of his proposed writin gs, he was able to devote"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"DOMINION OF HEROP ASS 367 his attention to reorganizing his work on the original plan which had been interrupted by the car cras h. Because of the support they had given him, he was going to begin with the America ns. Gurd jieff informed the group of five that, regretta bly, he would be forced to reject many of their fe llow Orage ans. He proposed to treat those who were rejected so that they should be completely disillusioned both with his ideas and with Orage himse lf. His five leading henchmen were warned not to tell anyone of this projected piece of theate r. On November 21, when Gurd jieff delivered a lecture in the apartment where he was stayi ng to all Orage's pupils who could attend, he told them that he had intended to divide the pupils at Fontainebleau into three catego ries. When Orage came to New York, he had become a candidate fo r the middle group-b ut that was all. The results of Gurd jieff's \"accident\" had left Orage high and dry in America and Gurdjieff without a source of income in France . Orage had behaved much better and with less cause than some of his other pupils, said Gurd jieff ; he had imm ediately begun to send him money. For his part, he was compelled to turn a blind eye to various misint erpretations of his teaching until his health was fu lly restored and he could divert his attention from his writing. After this acknowle dgment, Gurd jieff's next words seem at first sight completely inexplica ble. In an early version of this chapter he is especially virulent agai nst Orage . Orage had made various collecti ons, a portion of which he had sent on to Gurd jieff -Gurdjieff implies that he had kept large quantities of money fo r himse lf-and in order to justifY the levying of contribution s had started unauthorized classes fo r Gurd jieff's movements, directing his own group s, using only the various preliminary instructions wh ich he had absorbed in his short time as a pupil. This was all the material with which Orage had to work, and his pupils had therefore been driven mad: it was as if they were trying to become generals by constantly practicing the introductory drill fo r raw recr uits. Gur dj ieff added some gratuitous insults about Mrs. Orage, a cause appare ntly of Orage's vast �enses which obliged him to continue manipulating the small amounts of material already in his possessi on .... To his New York audience, most of whom must have been baIRed, ilnnoyed, or shocked by his denunciati ons of their beloved leader, Gur dj ieff then announced the plan of which he had told five selected pupils: teorgan izing his work in a new fo rm. No one could join the new group , he �d, who fa iled to sign a fo rm of obligation which he dicta ted. This fo rbade In embers of his projected new group to associate with any of the Orageans etcept those who were named in a list which Gurdjieff proposed to distr ibute. They were also prohibited from having anything to do with Orage himself. While Gurd jieff discoursed to the select band who had at once signed the"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"368 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE obligati on, his original audience had been decimated by the fe rvent Orageans who were suspicious of Gurd jieff and wanted to remain fa ithful to Orage alone. There was a third group which came in fo r Gurd jieff's most ponderous irony: they sent a telegram , asking fo r the advice of Orage , who was on his way fr om England. These ditherers tried to postpone their decision whether or not to sign until Orage himself landed. He arrived at the beginning of December and promptly asked fo r an interview . Gurd jieff replied that, being a man of his word, he could not possibly meet Mr. Orage unless he also signed the obligation imposed on all the other members of the New York groups. To the astonishment of Gurd jieff's entourage , Orage at once signed the obligat ion, although it appeared quite absurd to ask him to promise to dissociate himself fr om his pupils-even to break with himsel f. But, according to Gurdjieff, Orage fo und nothing contradictory in the request. He explained that fo r a long time he had fe lt the contradiction between his inner uncertainties and the part of the omniscient Teac her he had to play. He had wanted to put an end to the charade much earlier, but circum­ stances had prevented him fro m making a final decisi on. Now he would take the opportunity of signing the obligation to make a clean break with the people whom he had lately taught-as a teacher; and to have nothing to do with A. R. Orage-the Orage who had fo rmerly existed. He asked to be allowed to join the new group as an ordinary member. Gurd jieff describes his reactions on hearing of Orage 's surrealistic decision. He was concocting one of his exotic dishes when the news was brought to him, and when it had sunk home, he was so affected-- that he broke down completely. He rushed into his bedroom in a flood of tears, and had to be rescued by Dr. Stoerneval with whisky. Despite the ever-present possibility that this story is one of Gurd jieff's mystifying parable s, there is evidence that fo r once he is speaking of real events. After Orage's signature , those pupils who had been holding back rushed to sign the obligation, and Gurdjieff established a scale, of fines acco rding to the resource s of each defaulter. His next lecture was given to a fu ll house, which included Orage and most of his disconsolate supporters , who bad now been well and truly shorn. To Daly King, who had been among the diehard Oragean s, the whole fa rrago seemed a pointle ss bluff, and he consigned Gurd jieff's exerci ses to the kindergart en. He and the other recalcitrants were permitted to atte nd all Gurd jieff's meetings as usual, and he therefore concluded that Gurd­ jieff's repudiation of Orage had no real significance . But later he changed his mind; and fr om the drama Gurd jieff staged in the winter of 1931 arose count less conf usions which nearly submerged the Work in the United ' State s."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"DOMI NION OF HER OPASS 369 Gurd jieff's activities continued in their elliptical fashion. His apartment on West 59th Street was filled to bursting with pupils, acquai ntanc es, and the smell of cooking. Readings of the first and second series of his writings were held in Studio 61 of Carnegie Hall, with Mme. de Salzmann in charge of the first book and Gurd jieff's German secretary, Louisa Goepf ert, in charge of the second. The Third S e ri es -which may have consisted only of his lectures-was read in Gurd jieff's apart ments by Dr. Stoerneval . The fe es fo r attending public readings were two, three, and fo ur dollars respectively , and private readings were also held -at which presumably Gurd jieff presided -for higher fe es. This wholesale takeover of his pupils left Orage in a by now fa miliar but still precarious position . \"I've led the life of Jack -in-the-Box since my return here,\" he wrote to Nott on March 1. To make ends meet he \"had to conduct fo ur literary classes a week, \" as there was no income fr om his old groups, and Gurd jieff had chased three-quarters of his fo llowers away with his perpetual demands fo r money. G. talks as if he expects me to carry on as before; but in spite of my constant association with him, I'm not fe eling even warm about group work . He has a mir acle to perform in ten days. He has the intention, it really appears, of publishing part of Beelzebub's Tales here in New York. That will be something tangible if it comes off. But he is making such impossible conditions that no publisher will accept them; and, in fact, G. cannot really expect it. All the same, I do think we are near publishing something! It is doub tfu l whether Gurd jieff was serious about publishing Beelzebub's Ta les . Orage had always wanted the book published, and it might be that Gurd jieff was simply humoring his subordinate . Nott tells a story about Alfred Knopf which seems to show that Gurd jieff was not exactly pressing hard fo r publication . As the publisher of Tertium Orga num, Knopf approached Gurd jieff to see whether he could add Beelzebub's Tales to his list. He was told by Gurdjieff: \"First clean your house, then perhaps you can have my boo k.\" This story may well be apocryphal, and Nott's statement that Gurd jieff left America without selecting a publisher because «the time fo r publication was not come\" piously wishful thinking. On March 20, Orage wrote to Too mer that Gurd jieff had left him with a selection of chapters \"to get published or to publi sh.\" He wrote that Knopf had the typescript and that \"after him I will send it to others .\" Eight days later, Too mer was told that Knopf had turned it down and that Beelzebub's epic voyage had continued to Doubleday . \"I share your opinion that no p ublisher will accept it.\" Orage conc luded that they would have to issue it the ms e lves."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"370 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Despite his appare nt cooperation with Gurd jieff's plans, Orage himself had been irritat ed. \"The situation is anything but brig ht,\" he w r ote to Jean Too mer on March 28, \"and I conf ess to a little fa tigue with Gurdjieff and his ways. Perhaps that is beca use I've just had to find over two hundred dollars with which to discharge the debts he failed to remember!\" By April 10, he had still not been able to hold a group meeting. He wrote to Nott of \"the paral ysis left by G.\" This was only cured by the prospect of his own permanent departu re; and at the end of May he held his final meeting in Muriel Draper's apar tment. Carl Zigrosser remembers this last exhibition of the maestro's virtuosity: \"He rang all the hortatory change s, he played on all the emotions. He was witty , subtle, ironic, sarcastic, noble . He was prodigal with memorable phrases and precise fo rmulati ons. He beseeched and scolded like an elder brothe r. It was a brilliant performance .\" On July 1, a farewell party took place at Muriel Dra per's. Orage's fo rmer pupils mingled with his literary fr iends, among whom Zigr osser mentions E. E. Cummings and Lincoln Kirstein. Two days later the Orages left New York to live permanently in England. Thanks to Gurd jieff's machina tions, Orage left virtually nothing behind him- little, that is, of an organ ized sort , nothing except those intangible \"influenc es.\" On his arrival in England, he had a conversation with Nott which that kindly Boswell has recor ded. He said that he fe lt that his work with groups in America had come to an end, and another phase was beginning; that to every pupil the time comes when he must leave his teacher and go into life, and work out, digest, what he has acqu ired. Then he can return to his tea�er, if necessary, on another level. It was not that he had left Gurd jieff or the Teac hing, but beca use of both he had reached a certain stage, a nd it was necessary fo r him to stand on his own fe et. Notl's opinion provides the \"orthodox\" verdict from the viewpoint of a pupil of both Orage and Gurdjieff. Orag e's group had \"got stuck\" and needed to be shock ed. Orage himself was not fired, repudiated or driven away by Gurdjieff, but brought to renounce his former self and to emerge a better and more self-reliant man. There is one item of evidence which this possibility igno res. Why did Gurd jieff colla pse in a paroxysm of weeping when he heard of Orage's subtle decision to have nothing to do with himself? Was it�eca use, despite unbearable provocatio n, Orage had understood so correctly what was required of him? Or was it because Orage had not understood at all? Gurd jieff was clearly trying to destroy all traces of Orage's work in New"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"DOMI NION OF HE ROPASS 371 York, and-p erhaps equally important to him-to send the Orages away fo r good. It m ay be that Gurdjieff was finding it next to impossible to relieve Orage of his dependence on him. This would explain his threats and insults to Mrs. Orage : they were attempts to provoke Orage into standing up fo r himself and his wife; ultimately perhaps into leaving. It also explai ns Gurd jieff's colla pse in New York. For by signing the obligation imposed on all his fo rmer pupils, Orage-slippery as a philosophic eel-had wriggled out of a position in which he seemed certain to be fo rced to break with Gurd jieff . He had detected a symbolic significance in Gurd jieff's demands which had never been intended-Gurd jieff's account of his request to Orage can be read to mean that he acted as a joke. Perhaps Gurdjieff broke down and cried because of his real affection fo r his super-idiot and his apparent inability to get that idiot to see two things: that he must take responsibility fo r hims elf, and that his quicksilver mind was not the answer to all prob lems. Orage said goodbye to Gurd jieff fo r the last time on May 24, 1931. Later in England he received a number of communi cations fro m the Master asking him over to France , such as a letter of August 1932 requesting him to come fo r a day, or at least to send Jessie. Orage replied: \"There was a time when I would have crossed oceans at your bidding. Now I would not even cross the Cha nne l.\" There are a succession of postscripts to this story . An almost iden tical situation had arisen in Gurd jieff's relat ionship with the de Hartmanns-and at virtually the same time. Both husband and wife had accompanied Gur dj ieff to New York on the trip early in 1929, and during this time Gurd jieff had spoken at length to Thomas de Hartmann about the need to esta blish his career independently of the Prieure. On their return from N ew York, he began to make life very unpleasant fo r the de Hartma nns. Eventually, \"after a very strained and difficult conversati on,\" they fe lt fo r�ed to go. Thomas de Hartmann was so affected that he hovered on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and was never able to mention Gurd jieff's name again. But Olga de Hartmann continued to visit the Prieure and accompanied Gurd jieff to Berlin in the autumn of 1929. All the time 9 urdj ieff put her under pressure. , .One evening after their return from Berlin, she was with Gurdj ieff at the Prieure . He asked her to do something which she fe lt unable to do and told her that if she refused some terrible event would befall her husband.

Poised in the carriage doorway, he made a dramatic exit as the boat­ train steamed out of the stat ion. Olga de Hartmann returned home and lay in bed fo r four days before she could face the reality of the world outside. The de Hartmanns do not specify what pressures Gurdj ieff exerted on them, and it does not matter. Without minimizing the distress which his technique caused, it should be noticed that-if we admit the possibility that Gurd jieff was trying to engineer a break-his methods were very similar with the Orage s. To the de Hartmanns also , he sent mes sages asking them to return. And although they remained fa ithful to Gurd jieff' s i d eas, they too, resisted any atte mpts to entice them back. There is a story which shows that Orage took his separation fr om Gurd jieff in the same positive sense-despite his angry telegram . A pupil was sent by Gurd jieff from Paris to London with a typescript fo r Orage to correct or translate . She was directed to travel by train and boat, as Gurd jieff had-or pretended to have-a great mistrust of aircraft . Despite the fo rceful courtesy with which Gurd jieff escorted her to the door of her railway carr iage, she was determined to save time by catc hing a plane to London. Dutifully climbing into the train, she climbed straight out again on the other side and made off in triumph to the airport. On her arrival in Lond on, she delivered her parcel to Orage and told him of her exploit. To her surprise, instead of laughing or registering astonishment, he became fe rociously angry , and left his visitor in no doubt that she should on no acco unt have disobeyed Gurdjieff. On her return to Paris, she (:'onf essed her stratage m. Gurd jieff appeared a little irked by her cunning. \"So you think you smarter than Gurd jieffi\" he repeated in the tones of a Chicago gan gster. Then, becoming serio us: \"By this I know that Orage still friend .\" But his verdict was not completely favorable, as Jessie Orage fo und when she visited Gurd jieff's Paris flat after the Second World War. The usual fe ast was in progr ess, and a short conversation took place during which Gurd jieff said to her: \"Jessie, you have my plate , my dinner .\" \"No, I've had it,\" she answ ered. Gurd jieff then began to talk about a man whom he did not name. This man knew everything but lacked \"the simple understanding .... He tried for suc h,\" said Gurdj ieff, \"and was too intelligent to grasp it.\" She began to cry. Gurd jieff never took his eyes off her. On returning to England, Orage 's first th ought was to buy back the New Age; but Arth ur Brenton, who had edited the paper since shortly after Orage went to Fontain ebleau, refused to sell. Orage 's old colleagues 'in the Social Credit movement were at first wary of him. His articl es on \"An"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"DOMI NION OF HER OPASS 373 Editor's Prog ress \"-which had been published in the New Age during 1926-seemed to argue that he had renounced political problems for good, and he was resented as an opport unist and a turncoat. A certain amount of lobbying took place on his behalf. According to the poet Hugh McDi arm id, the return of the prodigal was enveloped in mystery. \"When news got about that he was back,\" he write s, \"a mutual friend offered to motor me down to the out- of-the­ way Sussex farmhouse where he was living. Great secrecy was enjoined on me and the visit was given all the trappings of melodrama. But I was not disa ppointe d. Orage was well worth meeting under any circumstanc es.\" What the doubters perhaps did not know was that Orage had returned to the cause of Social Credit in New York, and as a result, a New Economics group had been fo rmed with Gorham Munson as the editor of its paper, New Democracy . From his sympathizers in the United States, Orage raised a subsidy of 1000 pounds fo r a new magazine to be run fr om the Social Credit viewpo int. From offices in the building in Chancery Lan e where he had edited the New Age, Orage brought out the first number of his New English Weekly on April 21, 1932. His \"Readers and Writers\" column revived his old pen name of \"R. H. C,\" and the very first article began in a way which seemed to show that the old Orage was back in fighting fo rm. \"As I was saying ten years ago,\" R. H. C. remark ed, \"when my literary studies were suddenly lifted to another plane, Mr. Ezra Pound is one of our very few men of letter s.\" To some people it seemed that this was indeed the same Orage . Paul Selver's heart had sunk when reading the \"bewildering\" series of auto­ biographical articles on \"An Editor's Progr ess.\" They appeared to him to show an intellectual and stylistic softening; and there is some truth in this 6:iti cism, for Orage's fastidious prose was markedly less taut in the scattered articles which he wrote during his long sabbatical . But when Selver actually met Orage agai n, all his doubts vanished. \"Yes, this was the Orage to whom I had always paid homage. No decline what ever. Not changed in the slight est. \" Others thought differently. Nott saw him as \"a humbler, bigg er, more understanding and a more youthful man. \" This was not only the impression of those who were informed as to his activities since 1923. Eric Gill wrote after Orage's death : \"I do not know what gift or what grace he received at Fontain ebleau. It is certain that his deep appetite for religion was there, in some manner, satisfi ed.\" To Philip Mairet, who had passed the years since Orage left England close to Dmitrije Mitrinovic, the new Orage \"had a new and deeper kind of Wisdom. If in conversation he showed less brilliance fo r the love of it, his fewer words had more weight. Of the more than occasiona l arrogance of former days there was scarcely a trace : his judgments were as quick and accurate, if delivered from a higher and more detached point of view.

Orage's lucidity of mind earned the renewed applau se of such natural sympathizers as T. S. Eliot; and he continued to discover young writers-inc luding the eighteen-year-old Dylan Thomas. But he failed to mobilize support of the quality he had fo rmerly com­ manded. \"His return was the signal fo r a welc ome,\" wrote his old ally, Maurice Reckitt, \"the extent of which may have surprised him, but the practical results of which did not amount to much. The prophet was not wholly without honour, but he was still almost without discipl es.\" Philip Mairet reports that the New English Weekly started life with a larger circulation than the New Age had boasted when Orage sold it; but the earlier target would not have been difficult to match and, after his ten years of exile, Orage had lost touch with-liter ary fa shion. As before, he had now to depend on private subsidies to support his journal ism, and the New English Weekly consistently lost money. For contribution s, he had often to rely on his American friends and fo rmer pupils- sometimes the products of his writing school . Lack of material success or any real recognition of his new venture depressed Orage . Nott saw a great deal of him at this time and recalls that he fe lt trapped by his political \"Notes of the Week.\" Orage slightly scandalized his friend-an ardent Social Credit or-by admitting that his interest in monetary reform was only a \"pseudo-inter est. \" Philip Mairet had become sub-editor on the New English We ekly, and he noticed th� stresses under with Orage's work as a publici st now placed him. \"If the tension between this public work and his other-worldly aspirations had much to do with his previous flight fr om London, the gulf between them was now wider still. He was indeed better able to bear the stra in; only once did he allow me to see something of what it cost him; but there can be little doubt that it shortened his life.\" One result was that Orage began to contemplate the chances of an academic post. Another was that his interests turned again toward the tran scendental . DUring its first year, the New English Weekly had avoided anything which suggested the occult. Orage had received a warning that his unorthodox interests were unpalatable to the circles in England which he wished to influence; fo r soon after his return , he had greatly alarmed a Social Credit audience with a dogmatic state ment about diff erent human types. Apart from a lighthearted reco mmend ation of the antholOgi st of inexplicable happen ings, Charles Fort-Gorham Mu nson was also a Fort enthusiast and compared him to Gurd jieff -Orage contented himself"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"DOMIN ION OF HEROPASS 375 during 1932 with a single printed statement on his esoteric standp oint. Although this may have been designed to placate his critics , it shows without any ambiguity the effects of his time with Gurdjieff. His credo took the form of a note on the Jubilee of the Society fo r Psychical Research : After years of search and research my concl usion upon the three greate st and most important questions-survival after death, immor­ tality, the meaning and aim of existenc e-is that I do not know. The worst of it is that I do not know either whether anybody has ever possessed such knowledge or even whether such knowledge is possible. Although Candide-like he advised his readers to \"cultivate their gardens,\" in the last half of 1933 he gave increasing evidence of a return to the interests which predated Gurdjieff. For a brief period he was associated with Dmitr ije Mitrinovic in the latter's ambitious \"New Britain\" move­ ment. In the New English We ekly, James Young made a reappearance­ although with a savage attack on spiritua lism. But by 1934, even \"M. B. Oxon\" was back in Orage's columns, indomit ably discussing the time theories of J. W. Dunne . From August 1933, Orage also began to contribute regular articles to The Aryan Path, the Theosophical magaz ine whose presiding spirit was J. D. Beresf ord, another old friend from the days of Ouspensky's first arrival in Lond on. These articles continued until the month before his death , and were cast in a familiar mold. To Philip Mairet the beginning of 1934 signaled the appearance of Orage in detached and philosophic mood. He spent much time listening to the long monologues of A. E., in whom he discovered a kindred spirit. He discussed immor tality and Jung, and no longer always changed the subject when Gurdjieff and his ideas were mentioned. In the second edition of his Me11Wir, Mairet cuts a passage which is remarkably interesting for the light it sheds on Orage 's philosophy immedi ately before his death . \"I will not attempt to recall, for fear of misrepresentati on,\" he originally wrote, \"some things he said of Jesus Christ, except that some of his supporters would have been shocked at their relative orthodoxy, theologically speaking-but not moralistically so, for he had no use for a humanist Jesus .\" Such a simple attitude-the apprehension of new meaning in old truths- seems quite often to be adopted by those who pass through the Gurdjieff mill. Through Rosamund Sharp , Orage made contact with Ouspensky, but declined the latter's invitation to visit him and dubbed the typescript of A New Model of the Universe, a \"new muddle .\" He did not hold completely aloof; for although he refused a former pupil of his own in New York an introduction to Ouspensky himself, he did pass her on to Ouspensky ' ,"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"376 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE secretary, Mme. Kadlo ubovsky. Both Mairet and Nott were under the impression that during the last year of his life Orage hoped to alter completely the nature of the New English Week ly . He spoke optimistically of the conc lusion of the struggle fo r Social Credit and hinted that he was planning to introduce social and literary critici sm based on Gurd jieff's ideas. What were Orage's fe elings toward the man who had dominated so much of his life? \"He left Gurdj ieff, \" says Mrs. Orage, \"but he stayed with the System .\" One American pupil of both Orage and Gurdjieff remembers a conversation between the two men-probably in the winter of 1929-3� during which Orage appears to have told Gurd jieff that although he had helped the Work, he had not been given the help which he himself needed. If Nott is to be believed, Orage's position in 1934 was still the same. He conf essed that he had never been able to decide whether Gurd jieff was a saint, a charlat an, or a mixture of both. This /lttitude seems to be reflected in a short sketch printed in the New English Weekly not long before his death . This is called \"A Dealer in Imm ortality ,\" and is by one \"Edward Farrell .\" It is set in the United States and concerns a Gurdjieff-type figure who claims to conf er immor tality by leading his clients along a philosop hical path toward a recognition of the mystic unity of things. The story ends with the arrival of a telegram accu sing the dealer in imm ortality of fr aud and the hurried departure of that individual fo r France . As a literary effort, it is poor stuff; and it is left unclear whether \"Edward Farre ll\" thinks that his metaphysical huckster is a misunderstood genius or a crook. Nothing definite can be inferred fr om such ambiguous hints; but it WOU�1 probably not be fa r fr om the truth to say that Orage 's attitude to Gurd jieff approached the \"reverent agnosti cism\" which he then fo und so admir able in Julian Huxley. Nott maintains that, fo r all his doubts, Orage was convinced that \"some thing had changed\" in them as a result of their work with Gurdjieff. Together they speculated about recurrence . Next time ... perhaps they would be able to develop more quick ly, perhaps their places in the cosmic scheme would be taken by others and they themselves liberated fr om the demands of the machine .... Orage might not know the answers he had sought-and might admit to not knowing-but he had no regr ets. A week before his death he exclai med to Nott: \"You know, I thank God every day of my life that I met Gurdjieff. \" By this time it appears that Orage knew that he was under sentence of death . His health had deteriorated in the early part of 1934, and he suspended publication of the New English We ekly during August. On returning to work, he caught a cold and began to suffer fr om an acute pain below the heart.

If such an event had occurred in a novel, reviewers would have dismissed it as being too obviously contri ved. \" Orage had been asked to broadcast on Social Credit. This coup was regarded both as a personal success and as a fe ather in the cap of Douglasites generally. He prepared his speech with great care , and delivered it on the night of November 5. During the talk he was sharply attacked by the pain in his heart, but the broadcast was acco unted a succ ess. That night he died in his sleep. The play called \"A. R. Orage\" had ended with the precision of his own most mannered sentence s. To Nott there had appeared signs and port ents. About a fo rtnight before Orage's death he had watched his friend talking to a group in the Chancery Lane ABC cafe . \"A pale yellow light issued from Orage , a nimbus, not only round his head, but around his whole fo rm . . .

Orage was sixty-o ne, and the period of his greatest editorial brilliance was twenty years behind him. His mourners were not lamenting the editor of genius or the publicist of Social Cred it-ho wever much they pretended that this was what they were doing.

The insubst antial quality of Orage 's last years may suggest a withd rawal from the world into disillusion. If so, this was not acco mpanied by bitter ness, but reflected a positive nature resting after the tumult of its Gurd jieff adventure . To allow Orage to sink into some pit of piety is to detract fr om the essential excitement of his time with Gurdjieff: he had been exercised, made supple, stretched -until, acco rding to some, the light shone thro ugh. The explicit character of Orage makes clearer, howeve r, the problems which surround the more reticent Ouspensky. The accepted explanations of why Ouspensky and Gurdjieff parted company show a clear division be tween the disciples of the two men, and-particularly among Ouspensky's more superstitious fo llowers-the situation is sometimes repre sented as a mysterious esoteric duel; a struggle of the magician s. But the complexities which surround Orage's break with Gurdjieff should warn the inquirer against acce pting too facile an interpreta tion. The case from Gurd jieff's side has been made by Nott, who relies partly ')n information from his friend, F. S. Pinder. It appears that after [;urd jieff's London visits in February 1922, he made another trip later that winter, taking Pinder with him as interpreter. At a meeting of Ouspensky's ?upils, Gurdjieff dismayed the audience by turning on their revered .:eacher and tearing him to shreds. He was too intellectual , declared 379"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"380 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE Gurdj ieff; if he really wanted to understand , he must go back to the beginning again, and \"work on hims elf. \" A little later, when Ouspensky was visiting Fontainebleau , Gurd jieff used Pinder to interpret a lecture in the Study House. When Ouspensky obj ected to some of Pinder's translat ions, Gurd jieff turned on him with , \"Pinder is interpre ting fo r me, not you !\" The Pinder-No tt version of the break is that Ouspensky was mista ken in thinking that he understood \"Gurd jieff's inner teachi ng.\" They argue that he saw himself as a religious philosopher in the trad ition of Vladimir Soloviev and was determined at all costs to fo und his own school and have disciples sitting at his own fe et. Nott maintains that it was Gurd jieff's trip to London in late 1922 which really caused the break, and reports a remark made by Gurdjieff to Pinder on their way back to France . \"No w, \" he said, \"they will have to choose a teac her.\" There are several diff erent interpretations of the \"Gurdjieffian\" school of thought. Ouspensky is sometimes seen as being both lazy and a thief. In Nott's wor ds, he \"had a perf unctory fling\" at the movements, then abandoned them as unproducti ve. He was a writer when he met Gurdjieff, and he remained a writer- \"stealing\" Gurd jieff's material and manuf actur­ ing a \"System\" which was never intended to be systematized or even made public at all. In fact, he was what Gurd jieff called a \"hasna muss\"; a man lacking conscience or any sort or scruple s. More frequently Ouspensky is seen as someone who failed the tests which Gurd jieff set him. According to this interpreta tion, he could not withstand Gurd jieff's onslaughts on his self-importance and over-intellec­ tual ism. The attitude treating Ouspensky as a \"failure\" sometimes mellows into understanding and sympat hy. Gurd jieff's \"shocks ,\" it is emphasized, were often really intolera ble; and Ouspensky was esse ntially a nice man whose conscience might have been offended by any one of Gurd j ieff's outrag eous acti ons. It should be clear by now that part of the Gurd jieff discipline consists in conf ronting the pupil with what fo r him are the worst things in the world : things which fo r him at that moment . repr esent limitations of his nature to which he cannot admit -of which he is possibly even unable to conc eive. It may be that there is no limit to how far this can be carr ied, and there have certainly been catas trophic fa ilur es. There may have been simple conflict between Ouspensky's preconception s-which he may never have recogn ized as such-and the �eliberate acti ons of his unpred ictable teac her. Perha ps, it is suggested, there was some action­ immoral, unforgiva ble, crimi nal- which Ouspensky recognized might have its place in the context of the Work, but which he could not himself accept. However, the suspicion that Gurd jieff had tried to drive away Orage and the de Hartmanns can lead to a very different interpretation of the evidence of Nott and Pinder. Ouspensky's withd rawal might have been exactly the"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"WHA T STRU GGLE? WHA T MAGICIAN S? 381 result fo r which Gurd jieff was striving. Ouspensky broke with him at Essentuki, rejoined him at Constantinople, and once more returned to work with him in London and Paris. Would he never learn to stand on his own two fe et? It is conceivable that Gurd jieff reasoned in this fa shion and forced his pupil into making the final separation fo r hims elf. There is also the consideration that Ouspensky's followers might have been thoroughly confused by an appare nt contradiction between their teache r's methods and the more outlandish tactics of Gurdjieff. There are indications that Ouspensky partly agreed with this estimate of Gurd jieff's purpose. He writes that Gurd jieff asked him to come and live in Fontainebleau several times during the period between the acqu isition of the Prieure and his departure fo r America. \"There was a good deal of temptation in this .\" The term \"temptati on\" is always used by Gurd jieff and Ouspensky to signify a process of deliberate deception carried on in \"esoteric schools\" to test the pupils; and both Orage and the de Hartmanns were exposed to the ident ical \"temptati on.\" Ouspensky clearly made the same deduction as had Orage and the de Hartma nns: the break must be absolute . Thus he returned from France after Gurd jieff's departure fo r the United States and told those who wanted to work with him that \"my work in fu ture would proceed quite independently in the way in which it had been begun in London in 1921 .\" In the rather doctrinaire atmosphere of his London grou ps, the ominous \"G.\" was legislated out of existence, although Ouspensky never denied that what he taught derived from him. On a number of occasions he amplified what he said in In Search of the Miraculous about his break with the Master. It is necessary to examine in more detail the idea that Ouspensky was able to break away on his own as a result of what he learned from Gurdjieff, rather than as a reaction against it. In Search of the Miraculous concentrates on his separation of the man Gurd jieff from the ideas of Gurdjieff. From what we know of Ora ge's life aft�r his parting with the Great Magician , it seems that he too may have perf ormed such a painful division. While the Man Who Knows still seemed to know a lot, he himse lf appeared less admir able than before. \"I saw clearly at that time,\" Ouspensky had written of his break at Essentuki, \"that I had been mistaken about many things I had ascribed to G.\" In the language of psychoanal ysis, we should say that the effects of the tran s­ fe rence were wearing off. Ouspensky's idea of the perfect master had been strongly influenced by Nietzsche. \"Men who seek for a real, living superman in the present, \" he Wrote in A New Model of the Universe, \"somehow thereby reveal a higher principle in their souls. \" Ouspensky's discovery that the seeds of a new humanity were latent in the individual came as the result of his search fo r a superior breed of human being already in existence: \"Ma n finds superman"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"382 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE within himself when he begins to look for him outside hims elf, and he can find superman outside himself when he has begun to look fo r him within hims elf. \" Almost certainly the \"things I had ascribed to G.\" had to do with Ouspensky's vision of Gurd jieff as a representative of superhumanity . Discussion with the visible superman threw him back on the superman within- his own higher fo rces, that superior self which he had fe lt assert itself during the sad and dangerous winter of 1919. When he broke with Gurd jieff in Esse ntuki, Ouspensky reverted to his earlier esoteric interests and continued his search fo r the miracul ous. On the appearance of his A New Model of the Universe in 1931, he remarked to Kenneth Walker that he hoped to make contact with an \"es'bteric school\" as a result of its publicati on. This prompts the question: to what did he think he had belonged during his time with Gurd jieff? Orage considered the Prieure an \"esoteric school ,\" although Gurd jieff had always proc laimed that his groups were only an outer, or at best, a central ring on some occult target. Perhaps Ouspensky's image of an \"esoteric school\" was destroyed at the same time as his image of the, Master. Or, perhaps he decided that Gurd jieff's \"school\" was , as Gurd jieff claimed it to be, a preparatory school fo r higher things. By February 1923, when the London Daily News interviewed him, Ouspensky had become careful not to present himself as in any sense Gurd jieff's subordinate . \"Gurdjieff and I have reached our present stage of knowledge by long and hard work in many lands,\" he was quoted as saying; and his interviewer reported that \"in Gurd jieff he fo und a kindred spirit who had gone fa rther on the same road.\" This raises a second crucial question: now that we are more fa miliar with Gurd jieff's tactics in presenting his ideas favorably to those he considered likely to respond \" had Ouspensky ever been just ified at all in thinking that he and Gurd jieff were in fact trav�ling the same road ? Perhaps their objectives had only coincided fo r a time; or perhaps Ouspensky's aims-the attain ment of \"cosmic consciousn ess,\" the achievement of fr eedom in a universe . of many dimension s-had never been the same as those of Gurd jieff? The Master had emphasized \"the teaching by itself cannot pursue any defi nite aim . It can only show the way fo r men to attain wha tever aims they might have .\" Ouspensky had passed through a proces s, reached a point at which, after protracted anguish, he made a decision and emerged on the other side of the tunnel. He may have thought that Gurd jieff's more experienced fo llowers would leave after the expedition through the mountains from Essentuki because they, too, would recognize the nature of the process they had undergone. This possibility is supported by the fact that Ouspensky made a divJsion between his own ideas-like those on eternal recurrence-and Gurd f ieff's"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"WHA T STRU GGLE ? WHA T MAGICIAN S? 383 System. He and his pupils were engaged in dual activity. On the one hand, Ouspensky taught Gurd jieff's System; and on the other, he enlisted his pupils' help in his own search fo r the miracul ous. The ideas of the System were sound, but the source from which he had received them had become tainted. Accordi ngly, they must all search fo r the Source fr om which Gurd jieff himself had received the ideas. In a private conversation in the winter of 1924, Ouspensky replied to J. G. Bennett's enthusiastic affirma­ tion that the System could lead to \"Consciousness and Immortality\" in terms of the most stoical pessimism: We were in his little sitting room in Gwendwr Road , West Kensington. He stood with his back to the gas fire, peering at me as usual through his powerful pince-nez. He sighed deeply, and said: \"You say that you are sure that this work can lead to consci ousness and immo rtality . I am not sure. I am sure of nothi ng. But I do know that we have nothing, and ther efore we have nothing to lose. For me it is not a question of hope, but of being sure that there is no other way . I have tried too much and seen too much to believe in anything. But I will not give up the struggle . In princip le, I believe that it is possible to attain what we seek-but I am not sure that we have yet fo und the way . But it is useless to wait. We know that we have something that has come from a Higher Source. It may be that something more will come from the same Source .\" Ouspensky had really made two separation s: he had separated the man Gurd jiefff rom Gurd jieff's ideas, and he had separated his own theories and aspiration s from Gurd jieff's Syst em. In public he never criticized his old tea cher; but in private , he fo und fa ult with Gurd jieff's conduct, on Gurd jieff's own terms. In October 1935 and October 1937, he detailed his obj«rction s. In the beginning, he said, Gurd jieff had laid down three principles for the Work which he contradicted by his later behavior. The . fitst was that no one must do anything without understanding why they were doing it. The second was that no one should take anything on trust, but must verify any state ment of Gurd jieff's fr om their own experience . The third principle was that the leader of the Work must never produce inf atuation in his discip les. Ouspensky stated bluntly that in Essentuki Gurd jieff had begun to ignore these principles by demanding and accepting faith and blind obedience. He had ther efore broken the contract which bound his pupils · to him by betraying his position of authority . Ouspensky told his followers that, as well as his moral scruples about Gurd jieff's conduct, there was a further problem which had made him decide on the break in January 1924. Gurd jieff had begun accepting people"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"384 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE who were totally unprepared to benefit from the Work. Ouspensky said that the help he had given Gurd jieff in 1922 was a final test, a gamble to see whether anything would come of the Institute (at Fontaineble au-a fo rmat about which he had all along had the gravest doubts. He had collected money and sent people to Gurdjieff, but in the resigned anticipation of failure. All this is relatively mild, and may only have been the story which Ouspensky related for general consumption. His public loyalty to Gurd jieff was extrao rdinary, and he permitted himself fu ll liberty o£ expression only within his closest circle . Orage 's explanation of the split is therefore of great interest. He always maintained that it was Gurd jieff's near rape of Mrs. Y in 1923-24 that finally decided Ouspensky. The date tallies, and the scandal was of such proportion that the explanation is very plausible. If Orage were right, this would explain Ouspensky's obsession with Gurd jieff's \"integrity\" in his conversation with Boris Mour avieff after Gurd jieff's crash; and why­ out of loyalty to his teacher, as a \"member of the same family\"-he refused to tell Mour avieff why he had decided to work alone. So who is the Black Magician -Ouspensky, the thief; or Gurd jieff, the monster of depravity? The situation is more complicated than is clear from any partisan point of view. For although Ouspensk y implies that the break in January 1924 was complete, he quite definitely did continue to see Gurd jieff from time to time. He often traveled to Paris, where A New Model of the Universe and In Sear ch of the Miraculous were being translated under the supervision of Baroness Rausch de Trau benberg, and these absences effectively concealed such contact from his own pupils. For his part, Gurdjieff became increasingly careful to hide Ouspensky's arrival from the inmates of the Prieure. Margaret Anderson was surprised to find Ouspensky at Fontainebleau in the spring of 1924-- after the supposed break had taken place . He was there again for Mme. Ostrowsky's fu neral in 1926. At various other times during the 1920s, Ouspensky was seen at Fontainebleau , although Gurdjieff did not allow him to mix with his pupils and saw him only in the salon behind closed doors. The possibility of collusion--even of some master plan--can not be ruled out. In about 1930 Ouspen sky told several of his older followers that fo r the previous seven years he had been lying quiet in the hopes that something might come of Gurd jieff's work, much in the spirit that he had cooperated in the establishment of the Institute fo r the Harmonious Development of Man. Certainly, during the 1920s his activities had about them a quality of wait- and-see, and he kept them on a very modest scale. His pupils numbered between forty and fifty, and his meetings continued to be held at 38 Warwick Garde ns in South Kensington."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"WHA T STRUGGLE ? WHAT MAGICIA NS? 385 Kenneth Walker, a Harley Street surgeon who joined the group in 1923, condenses his memories of the unvarying nature of Ouspensky's meetings. The entry past Mme. Eugenie Kadloubovsky, the wife of a former Russian diplomat, who acted as Ouspensky's private secretary and administ rator; the austere schoolroom atmosphere; the slightly uncomf ortable and tense mood of Ouspensky's audience as they waited for their lecturer -who was inevitably late, as Gurdjieff and Orage were always late for their meetings­ are all of a pattern . The silent and almost imperceptible appearance of Ouspensk y-as Rom Landau described him, \"white-haired, clean-sha ven, above middle-age, bespectacled, stout\"-and the introductory, \"Well\" are later confirmed. It was always difficult to discover when the next lecture was scheduled, but the routine of the meeting itself scarcely varied. Some ten years after Walker's introduction to Ouspensky's lectures, Rom Landau found virtually the same arrange ments. Ouspensky's notes seemed to him to serve as \"a focus for his eyes\" rather than as an aid for the memory; and if he ever, in fact, needed to refer to them he disconcerted his audience by removing his spectacles altogether and bringing the manuscript right up against his nose. His heavily accented English and his staccato delivery made it difficult to follow what he was saying, but somehow this did not detract from the total effect of his manner. If the meeting were devoted to one of the introductory lectures which Ouspensky wrote, he would speak for three-quarters of an hour. More commonly, the t2lk would last from five to ten minutes and be fo llowed by another silence, appare ntly endless, until a pupil summoned up enough courage to ask a question. When he was once asked if he intended to publish his lectures, Ouspensky replied, \"What is the use? What is important is not the lectures, but the questions and answ ers,\" and this warning note is inserted by Mme. Kadloubovsky at the beginning of her selection from Ouspensky's talks entitled The Fourth Way . Landau makes it clear that the success of the meeting depended on the nature of the question: Mere literary or philosophical questions were not welc ome, and the effect of such a question was invariably devastat ing. Ouspensky was never rude, nor even ironical-but he was cruelly matter- of-fact, and would not tolerate questions that did not betray an honest desire to know more. Someone would ask, after Ouspen sky had discussed the various states of conscious ness: \"Is Buddha the seventh state of con­ sciousness ? \" Ouspensky, without even looking up to see who had asked the unfortunate question, would only answer: \"I don't know. \" He then"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"386 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE remained silent, and you felt that in his thoughts he probably continued, \"and I don't care.\" This method of question and answer reproduced in a fo rmal fashion the means by which Ouspensky and his companions had been forced to extract information from Gurdjieff in Russia. For although pupils might atte nd \"lectu res,\" they were never spoon-f ed, and Ouspensky emphasized that originally it had been no part of Gurd jieff's plan to teach a ·\"syste m.\" As Rosamund Sharp found, a pupil had to probe and prod to complete each facet of the Ouspensk ian universe. Undoubtedly this contributed to the excitement and the sense of purpose experienced by Ouspensky's followers. Their teacher was doing his best to reproduce for them his own experience . But because of the conditions under which he work ed, the ideas were easier to assemble than they had been when he learned them from Gu rdjieff. As he told his pupils: when he first met the System, he had been urged to \"remember himself\" fo r two years before it was finally revealed that man does not remember hims elf. What his follower, Rodney Collin-S�ith, later dubbed \"this strange unfolding of possibilities which went by the name of 0' s lectures\" proceeded quickly enough to provide a sense of achievement, the fe eling that something had been accomplished in the knowledge of the human mach ine. Rom Landau came as a ,journalist, but stayed out of fascinatio n. He noticed practical results \"even within a single year's work.\" Ouspensky's conception of \"the System\" was inseparable from his concept of \"scho ol.\" His obsession with the latter idea can be traced back to his own erratic educatio n; and it was always associated for him with the idea of a definite structure . The System as taught in such a school demanded a discipline on the part of the pupils. \"If there are no rules,\" said Ouspensky, \"there is no school .\" There were rules for a number of reaso ns. The first was to create friction so that the pupils would have to make efforts to overcome their negative emotions. Because the pupil must put himself in the hands of the teach er, \"one can only enter a school when one has lost, or is prepared to lose, a certain amount of self-wil l.\" And certain rules-such as that about not talking to strangers about their esoteric studie s-we re designed to prevent the Work from suffering. If they talked, their own valuation of their activities would suffer, and they ran the risk not only of distorting the ideas by transmitting them ineptly, but of broadcas ting material which should be kept for schoolwork . Such considerations produced the rule-dominated structure of Ouspensky's following. While some rules stemmed from the ideas of the Work itself, others seemed to have more to do with Ouspensky's rather formal correctness-perhaps a reaction against the flamboyance of Gurd-"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"WHA T STRUGGL E ? WHAT MAGICIA NS? 387 jieff. People were not allowed to address each other by their Christian names, and the custom of \"Mister s,\" \"Madams,\" and \"Misses\" continues today. Other rules were probably the result of Ouspensky's Russian upbringing, with its restrictions on free intellectual discussion, and his consequent fear of police of whatever nationality . Pupils attending meetings at Warwick Gardens had to leave their cars several blocks away, so as not to draw attention to the building. If they met each other in public-in the street or at a theater, for example--th ey were forbidden to recognize each other fo r fear of provoking a conversation with third parties about Ouspensky's work. For similar reasons they were not to mix friends \"in the Work\" with friends outside it. The rules certainly served to provoke friction; and they produced the \"secret society atmosphere\" which grated on outsiders like Nott. They could result in ludicrous situat ions. A regular attender at Warwick Gardens who wished to lunch with a fe llow Ouspensk ian might feel compelled to do so in a suitably clandestine rendez vous; and one furtive publisher took to telephoning his acquai ntances \"in the Work\" from public phone booths in order to circumvent possible eavesdroppin g from his office switchboard. The rules were open also to some potentially harmf ul applica tions. There was one, which had originated in St. Petersburg, that if a member of a group decided to leave, he should be ostracized by the remaining members. Gurdjieff had explai ned that the purpose of this regulation was to prevent errant pupils from being scared of returning. But in the later stages of Ouspensky's own work and under his successors, this rule was applied so that the offenders fo und t hemselves cut dead by numbers of people whom they regarded as their friends. Nothing could have been further from Ouspensky's own intention s. His essen tial kindliness overrode all other considerat ions. A pupil once came to him to announce her engagement to another of his followers. His face wreathed in smiles, Ouspensky said: \"In that case, of course, there are no rules.\" I ndeed the hallmark of his teaching when contrasted with Gurd jieff's was its gentleness. As one of his American followers expressed it: \"Ouspensky omelett e--not too tough.\" He refused to batter his pupils, and this decision dates back as far as the preliminaries to his \"miracle\" in Finland, when he arrived at \"the esoteric principle of the impossibility of violence .\" This did not mean that Ouspensky would not occasionally fry the omelette a little longer if the need arose. As one of his old pupils puts it: \"He was unfailingly courteous, but w hen it was absolutely necessary, he could also shout 'Mosc ow-fashion' -a sound which 'split the air' and shocked into awareness the day-dreaming pupil fo r whom it was intended .\" To all appearances-apart from the role of · the teacher- Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"388 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE seldom indulged in the more theatrical techn iques used by Gurd jieff. But it is very difficult to know where to draw the line in terms of theatrica lity. The sensation that the teacher was playing a role was never so marked among Ouspensky's pupils as it was among those of Gurdji eff; but Ouspensky possessed a verbal dexterity which could amount to the same thing. When combined with his skillful assessment of a pupil's psychological state, this could produce effects similar to those -which Gurd jieff achieved with more toil, sweat and pyrotechnics . Ouspensky's methods could be extremely subtle. For exam ple, once during the 1940s he was telling his pupils in New York about the doctrine of the \"many I's\": \"He scolded us severely ,\" one pupil writes, \"saying that we must never say 'I' bef ore we knew what we were saying\": \"Look what happe ned to the deVil ,\" he said. And I protested: \"But Mr. Ouspensky, God said to Moses on Mount Tabor, 'I am that I am !''' I was sitting in the first row. He paused, and looked at me for a while, and then said tenderly and very softly : \"Yes. But you, you see, you are not God. In you there is no 'I.' You must work. Work hard to have 'I. \", \"If only I had enough energy to work!\" I said sincerely. \"You have it,\" he assured me. \"You waste it in arguments .\" He gave me a long look, and then indulged in the shadow of a smile. Behind the stern figure of Warwick Garde ns, there was still the charming and affable Ouspensky of earlier days. He was now \"taking serious things seriousl y\"-and this may account for the slight oppressiveness of his System when contrasted \\Vith the JOVial performance of Gurd jieff-but he still enjoyed good food and Wine, still took pleasure in art and poetry, still displayed the sense of humor which he had shown Bech hofer Roberts in Rostov. In London he patronized a Chinese restaurant in Oxford Street, and his taste in tea became so celebrated that Twinings of the Strand regularly invited him to their major tastings. Some of his pupils found it hard to realize that he was a man like any other. Bennett remembers an expedition to buy prints of St. Petersburg for Ouspensky's flat, when he found himself unable hJ accept that this was not in some way a teaching expedition and that the Master needed relaxation like any other human being. By virtue of the teac h ing role, and the need to play a part to sustain it, the inevitable transf erence took place . One evening in Paris, Ouspensky and Mme. Ouspensky were sitting in a cafe with some of their pupils. Ouspensky was withdra wn, rugged, and Russian. \"Very hard to make a friend of Mr. Ouspensk y,\" said his wife; and what was"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"WHA T STRUGGL E ? WHA T MAGICI ANS? 389 perhaps merely a dig at a husband's moroseness thereafter came to be repeated as an element of the tea cher's mystique. Ouspensky saw his pupils privately in his flat in Gwendwr Road . The building is now demolished, but Kenneth Walker remembers it as \"a rather somber Victorian house in an equally dismal road.\" His description of Ouspensky's rooms gives the impression of a vaguely rundown atmosphere. \"There was a divan-bed� a bookcase , two chairs near to the gas-fire, and a large mahogany table on which rested a type-wri ter, writing materia ls, a camera, a galvanometer and some scientific apparatus of an unfamiliar nature. On the mantlepiece lay a half-fi nished tin of sardines, the remains of a loaf, a plate, knife and fork and a few morsels of cheese .... \" Until the late 1920s, this unrema rkable haunt of bache lor Bohemianism was Ouspensky's only home. Then sometime between 1929 and 1931, he came to a decision . His routine altered, and it was never the same again. In the autumn of 1930, he told J. G. Bennett and other leading followers that since the ,results he had expected from Gurdjieff's work had not materializ ed, he would therefore no longer apply the brake to his own activi ties. His last visit to Fon­ tainebleau was in 1931. On this occas ion Gurd jieff did not even allow him as far as the village of Avon, and their conference took place in the Cafe Henri IV at Fontainebleau. This meeting marked more decisively than the appa rent break in 1924 Ouspensky's complete separation of his work from Gurd jieff's. From this time or, his disapp ointment with Gurd jieff was more openly-and sometimes bitterly-ex pressed. He spoke of Gurd jieff's \"failure\" as a catastrophe greater than the Russian Revolution. On several occas ions he was even more emphatic. To one pupil who asked him privately what must have become a wearisome question, Ouspensky said quite simply: \"Well, he went mad, you see.\" Another complication is created by the role of Mme. Ouspensky. It has alr e ady been ment ioned that the Ouspenskys' marriage was an unusual arrangement and that when Ouspensky first arrived in London, his wife did not accompany him. Until about 1924-25, she lived at the Prieure. Gurdjieff is then reported to have sent her away , saying that her husband oc;leded her. Mme. Ouspensky left Fontainebleau, but ins tead of going to England-a country she loathed and whose language she never made any great eff ort to learn-she took a flat for several years at Asnieres near Paris. She did establ ish a working relati onship with her husband: some of the London pupils came to Paris to help with the translations of his books and formed a Work group under the direction of \"Madame.\" When, about 1927, Mme. Ouspensk y at last nerved herself to cross the"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"390 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE English Channel, the relationship of husband and wife remained as distant as before. Mme. Ouspensky used to say that Gurd jieff was her teach er, and for his part, Ouspensky had at least one mistress. In the various country houses in which the couple lived during the 1930s, they had separate quarte rs. These houses were Mme. Ouspensky's contributions to the Work in England, and gradually she drew in to her hands the reins of a communal activity of the sort that Gurdjieff had created at Fontainebleau . At first she came to England only for part of the summer, and the country houses which she supervised were taken in the names of one or other of Ouspensky's pupils. There was a house in the southeast of England, another called Pound Scots at High Wycombe, next the Oast House at Trosley in Kent, and in 1930 an increased number of pupils gathered in Wendover. At this succession of establi shments, Mme. Ouspensky set herself to reproduce Gurd jieff's assaults on his pupils' prejudices and self-images-in fact to provide the necessary friction for people to apply the principles which Ouspensky outlined. She still kept communications open with Gurdjieff in France, and Nott and Mme. de Salzmann were among those who acted as couriers. Ouspensky was as interested as his wife in tales of Gurd jieff' s activities; and his pupils remember how he sometimes turned a blind eye to emiss aries who were \"smuggled\" into Mme. Ouspensky's presence. But was this only a blind eye? It remains possible that the breach between the two Masters \"'::\"\" even the appa rently definite breach of 1931-was deliberately arrang ed: a play, rather as Gurd jieff's passage of arms with the Orageans that same year was a play. And perhaps the play was not even for the benefit of Gurd jieff's or Ouspensky's immediate followers, but for later generati ons. The idea of the struggle of the magicians creates an almost mythical polarity. To say that the pious comedy-the ludibr ium-was designed to provide the focus of a new religion may not be too wide of the mark . Let us remember the lack of evidence we possess fo r the historical reality of events before 1919. How far does the play extend? Ouspen sky's role may have been conceived as in some way mitigating the difficulties which Gurd jieff's methods inevitably created . Such a role might have the appearance of treache ry, and might even appear treac herous to Gurd jieff hims elf. It may have been that Ouspensky saw himself in the role of Judas to Gurd jieff's Christ. Gurdjieff taught in Russi a--and repeated in Beelzebub's T a les - that the accepted view of Judas Iscariot was completely wrong. In reality, he said, Judas had been the closest and most faithful disciple. The fact that Christ had to die was known to all the disciples beforehand: it was a necessary part of the mystery play which they had determined to act out. Withou 'l: the"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"WHA T STRUGGLE ? WHA T MAGICIA NS? 391 selfless performance of the traito r's role by Judas -who knew he would go down in history as a villain-the Christian drama would not have reached its necessary conclusion. Gurd jieff's favorite term of abuse fo r followers who began to teach his ideas was \"Judas-1scari ots\"; and we know that his vilification of Orage as a plagiarizer and as an ambitious man was not the condemnation which it sounds. Ouspensky was obviously another of the \"Judas-I scariots\" at whom Gurd jieff aimed his shaf ts. If they were in collusion to perfect their drama, it is possible that Ouspensky's appare nt defection was part of the design, that he was the closest and most trusted disciple despite all appearances­ or even that it was on his initiative that the drama was played in the manner in which it was. Ouspensky might well have thought that Gurdjieff needed a loyal opposition; and he might even have brought Gurdjieff himself around to this point of view. Shortly before his death Ouspensky told one of his pupils that \" she would understand\" -what, he did not say-if she read Old Diary Leaves . This is Colonel H. S. Olcott's six-volume history of the Theosophi­ cal Society . Knowing Ouspensky's methods -he once told a pupil to read the New Testament in every translation she could find, solely to draw her attention to a passage halfway through St. Matthew's gospel -we might expect the solution to be fa irly near the beginning of Olcott's saga. In the foreward to the first volume of Old Diary Leaves (1895), the Colonel explains his reasons for speaking out. The contro lling impulse to prepare these pages was a desire to combat a growing tendency within the Society to deify Madame Blava tsky, and to give her commonest literary productions a quasi-inspirational characte r. Her transparent faults were being blindly ignored , and the pinchbeck screen of pretended authority drawn between her actions and legitimate critic ism. Those who had least of her actual conf idence, and hence knew least of her private characte r, were the greatest offenders in this direction. It was but. too evident that unless I spoke out what I alone knew, the true history of our movement could never be writte n, nor the actual merit of my wonde rful colleague become known . One must still explain the abuse on both sides: Gurd jieff's castigation of Ouspensky as a \"weak man,\" and Ouspensky's seeming anger against Curd jieff's \"paranoia .\" It may well have been a case similar to that of Gurdjieff and Orage-but with a different and perhaps a larger end in view. Like Gurd jieff's characters \"Yelov\" and \"Pogossian ,\" Ouspensky and Gurdjieff may have flung mud at each other with the tacit understanding"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"392 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE that they were acting for each other's benefit. The opposition between the two figures has been made overacute by some of their followers, although such parti sanship may in fact be designed to conceal the true nature of the game in progre ss. Of course, just as in the case of Gurd jieff's accident, it is always possible that a plan was made and then miscarried; that both Gurdjieff and Ouspensky began to identify with their roles vis-a-vis each other; that Gurdjieff became in truth the strict chastizer of the erring disciple and Ouspensky grew more and more into the part of the disillusioned renega de. And although Ouspensky recorded Gurd jieff's teaching about Judas in In Sea rch of the Miracul ous, he himself maintained an opposite view in A New Model of the Universe . Does this counter act the previous argume nt; is it a deliberate contradiction inserted by the author-Qr is it his indirect confession, left behind fo r those who run to read ? Judas is simply a small man who found himself in the wrong place, an ordinary man, fu ll of distrust, of fears and suspicions, a man who ought not to have been among the apostles, who understood nothing of what Jesus said to his disciples, but a man who for some reason or other was accepted as one of them and was even given a responsible position and a certain authority . Judas was considered one of the favourite disciples of Jesus; he was in charge of the apostles' domestic arrang ements, was their treasurer. Judas' tragedy is that he fe ared to be exposed; he fe lt himself in the wrong place and dreaded the idea that Jesus might one day reveal this to others. And at last he could bellr it no longer. He did not understand some words of Jesus; perhaps he felt a threat in these words, perhaps a hint of something which only he and Jesus knew. Perturbed and frightened, Judas fled from the supper of Jesus and his disciples and decided to expose Jesus .... He needed to accuse Jesus and his disciples of crimes in order to feel himself in the right. Judas' psychology is a most human psychology, the psychology of slandering what one does not understand.

Alternatively, everything may be deceptio n."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"11 Real Psychology When in 1930-31, Ouspensky told his senior pupils of his decision to wait no longer for results fr om Gurd jieff's work, he added a strange corollary. Perhaps , he said, the expansion which he planned would attract the attention of the \"Inner Circle ,\" the invisible esoteric hierarchy which he appeared to believe was the source of Gurd jieff's teac hing. How seriously he took this hope is hard to say. Was the \"inner circle\" of humanity merely another carrot dangled before the noses of his expectant donkeys ? The fo rmation of some sort of organization to support the Work was an old project of Ouspensky. He told his pupils that this was his contribution to what Gurd jieff called \"the third line of wor k,\" that is, \"work fo r the benefit of the school .\" \"From the moment I met the system,\" he said, \"I felt that it was more important than anything I ever knew and, at the same time that it was known only to a small group of people . There were no organizati ons behind it, no help, no nothing . . . I decided to work on this line .\" But many of his associates thought that the pressure fo r expansion came largely from his wife . One fo rmer pupil writes: \"She might have been said to have bullied all of us into pressing this idea on 0., who gradually gave way.\" As the Ouspenskys' own organization expa nded, all efforts to make contact wit h the \"Inner Circle\" were abandoned. Mme. Ouspensky succeeded in converting most of her husband's pupils to a belief that they themselves would eventually constitute an \"inner circle ,\" and that a large"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"394 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE organization was necessary to screen possible recruits. Ouspensky himself was never completely won over, and insisted that the idea was his pupils' responsibility. However, in the autumn of 1930, he began the program of expansion with a series of public lectures under the title \"The Search for Objective Conscious ness.\" His audiences grew steadily. One result of the increasing number of pupils was that more people wanted to work with Mme. Ouspen sky in her country establishments. In 1931 a house called The Dell was taken at Sevenoaks; and although several pupils were driven away by the ferocity of \"Madam's\" treatm ent, next year a still larger house was found to be necessary. Sophia Grigorievna Ouspensky was to all outward appearan ces a termaga nt. \"She was, in every act, a great lady,\" Bennett write s. Nott calls her \"always the Grand Duch ess.\" She would never accept the title of \"teacher\" but always referred to herself as \"nurse.\" Nevertheless, her methods were modeled on Gurd jieff's; and she pulled no punches. Incongruously, her public mockery of her followers had at first to be carried out through an interpreter. This was Gurdjieff -but Gurdjieff without the subtlety or the warm th which redeemed all but his most outrageous violations of conventional human relatio nships. It is true that Mme. Ouspensky took on her shoulders all the odium generated by the unpleasant aspects of the Work: Ouspensky even stopped seeing all but his closest followers privately in Gwendwr Road and sent those who came to him with personal problems to his wife. So the contrast between the shrewish exterior of Sophia Grigorievna and t h e consideration shown by Pyotr Demi anovitch is a little unf air. But there is no doubt that if Mme. Ouspensky assumed the martyr's role, its vindictive side \"did not,\" in the words of one who suffered under her, \"conflict with her private inclination s.\" Neither was she above using people in Gurd jieff's most unscrupulous manner. When toward the end of the 1930s she took to her bed, it became appare nt that she had been training members of her entourage with just this eventuality in mind. Relieved of his tutorial activities, Ouspensky was able to devote more time to his literary work. In 1927 Ouspensky decided to revise In Search of the Miraculous and eliminate from it all confusion between his ideas and those of Gurdj ieff. This was a task in which he could never entirely succeed, but any developments of his own ide as-o n the fo urth dimension, eternal recurrence or the Superma n-found their way into the book which was eventually published as A New Model of the Universe; a better subtitle than the one given it would have been, \"app licati ons of the third canon of thoug ht.\" Only one of Ouspensky's changes in terminology is significant. This is the introduction of the phrase, \"the psychological method .\" When A New Model of the Universe was published in 1931, the expression gave reviewe rs"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOLOGY 395 great trou ble, and as the book was subtitled, \"principles of the psychologi­ cal method in its application to science , relig ion, and ar t, \" this was serio us. In the early editions of Tertium Orga num Ouspensky had not used the phrase at all. Inst ead , he talked of the limitations of scientific reasoning and the necessity of going beyond in terms of \"objective\" and \"subjective\" knowledge . Scientific investigation proceeds by the ob jective method. Where this fa ils, the only solution is to transcend the limitations of the human psyche by expanding \"the limits of receptivity. \" He had originally discussed this process as \"the possibility of the expansion of subjective knowledge .\" But by the 1923 edition of Tertium Organum this had become \"the possibility of the expansion of the application of the psychological metho d. \" Thus the daunting \"psychological method\" grew out of the earlier \"s ubjective knowledge .\" It was really an ext ension of Ouspensk y's memo­ randum to himself to \"think in other categorie s,\" just as A New Model of the Universe was an outgrowth fr om Tertium Organum and the illumin ation which acc ompanied it. \"The psychological method ,\" Ouspensky expla ined, \"is nothing other than the revaluation of all values fr om the point of view of their own psychological meaning and independently of the outer or acco mpanying fac ts on the basis on which they are generally judged .\" To take a literary analogy, this is an ar gument fo r revaluation of experience acco rding to the sort of standards fo r which C. S. Lewis argues in An Experiment in Criticism: that is, standards of literary appreciation ref erring only to the book under discussion. Kenneth Burke once gave an example of the psychological method fr om the real ms of mystical experie nce. \"If one under gas dreamed a metaphysical 'revelati on,' we could not dispose of the 'revelation' by saying that the man was under gas; it would remain a revelation regar dless of the 'facts .'\" The use of the psychological method eff ectively puts its user beyond criticis m. In the second edition of A New Model of the Universe, Ouspensky attempted to clarify his ar gument. A logical mind is all very well and most useful for certain operation s. But as soon as this logical mind has the courage to recognize its limitati ons, it becomes a \"psy chological min d.\" This is what he had meant by saying that the psychological method \"aims at keeping the mind itself constantly in its field of view, and at regarding all conclusions and discoveries relatively to the state or kind of mi nd.\" Then he makes one of his fa miliar paralogical lea ps: The psychological method is first of all a method of distinguishing between diff erent levels of thinking, and of realising the fa ct that perceptio ns change according to the powers and properties of the perceiving appara tus.

We can see how he arrived at this position through the logic of Tertium Organum and his ideas of the fourth psychological dimension. It is also quite in harmony with Gurd jieff's teaching on self-observati on. But why must the psychological mind realize the reality of the existence of esoteric know ledge? Ouspensky is once more indulging in dogmatic imperatives where he should have only expr essed possibilities. The clue lies in the original term, \"subj ective knowledge .\" The subjec­ tivity with which the New Model deals is Ouspensky's; and the argu ments fo r the existence of esoteric knowledge which its author finds compelling need convince no one but hims elf. \"The idea of the existence of a hidden knowle dge,\" he write s, \". . . must grow and strengthen in people 's minds from the realisation of the insolubility of many questions and problems which confront them .\" This expre sses his own driving fo rce in a single sentence. He never accepted the idea that, objectively, there might be no solution s and, where logic failed him, he took refuge in a private world . As long as the New Model is read conventionally, as an expre ssion of objective and universally valid truth , it must seem absurd. But if the reader appl ies Ouspensky's \"psychological method\" to the text, the book becomes merely an invitation to enter its author' s sub jective world . A New Model oJ the Universe is Ouspensky's application of the third canon of thought to his personal obsessions. As an indication of possibilities open to the untram­ meled mind, it proved an intoxicating experience fo r many of its reade rs. As the author once remarke d, it is \"a very long boo k.\" Most of the subject matter had been touched on in Tertium Organum, and what is new is the manner of present ation. The book possesses little consecutive argument, but it is rather the introduction to a state of mind. Some of its original fa scination is lost today in a world fa miliar with the mind-st retching concepts of science fiction; and it is significant that ideas derived from the New Model have formed a quarry fo r several · science fiction write rs. Ouspensky evidently hoped that some of his readers would fo llow him into his personal universe, and because this was by definition a universe where ordinary logic did not apply, he had to provide some hypothetical framework to provide an illusion of security for those who took the bait. So-very much on the principle by which Orage had dubbed Gurcbieff's"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOL OGY 397 cosmology \"the Greater Map\"- Ouspensky projected such a framework in the title chapter, \"A New Model of the Universe .\" He began by discussing the ideas of Newtonian physics and showed how the universe of scientific laws had been upset by the Eins teinian universe of relativity. He then proposed \"a new model\" which could disrupt existing physics just as the old physics had earlier been overturned. This \"model\" had in fact been completed by 1912, and Ouspensky had since been encouraged by Gurdjieff in the belief that the \"period of dimensions\" which he postulated expressed the same idea as Gurd jieff's Ray of Creatio n. In his earlier writings, Ouspensky had discussed five dimensions: the zero dimension, the conventional three, and the \"fourth\" of Time. In his \"new model\" he postulated two more. If we imagine Ouspensky's fo urth dimension, the Long Body of Time, stretched like a clothesline before us, the short fifth dimension runs perpendicular to it-like a series of monstrously elongated clothespins, with each clothespin representing one particular moment -say 10 A. M. on April 10, 1980. This is the dimension of the Eternal Now, and if each clothespin were crossed by other lines of Time, it would still and fo rever represent 10 A. M. on April 10, 1980. But at each moment in Time--at each moment when the clothesline is broken by the clothespin-a man's actions may affect what happe ns next, and thus the structure of the clothe sline, the shape of the Long Body, and also each subsequent moment of time, each Eternal Now, each clothespin fo llowing. But at each moment, there are also a number of possible courses of action open to us. Some are not selected and theref ore are not actua lized in the line of time along the clothesline. Ouspensk y then postulated a sixth dimension, one at right angles to the cloth esline and clothespin, which actualized all possibilit ies-whether selected or not selected -at once. This ingenious piece of speculation was linked to the idea of eternal recurrence . If a man recurs and recurs, the only means of altering the remors eless cycle is to make different choice s: that is, to select different possible courses of action at any moment in time. Thus by chan ging the future, by altering the shape of the Long Body as it will reveal itself aft er his choice, a man will also be altering his past-the configuration of the body of Time as it existed the last time he traveled this way. Acco rdingly, the next time around more new choices may be possible, and further chan ge. And further on (it is impli ed)-with unlimited change at each moment in time, when we are free of the tyranny of both past and future, when we arrive in the psycholog ical dimension of absolute freedom and contain within ourselves all possible worlds-this is indeed the wisdom of the gods. A New Model of the Universe had a mixed critical recep tion. It was"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"398 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE agreed that Ouspensky's essay on yoga was very fine, but the rest of the book met with general incomprehension, and the \"New Model\" chapter was severely criticiz ed. The Times Literary Supplement remarked that the book was \"very good when the author is telling us about himsel f; it is mostly very bad when he is telling us about anything else .. .. \" The Nation came even nearer the mark: \"the only knowledge that a non-esot eric reader will derive . . . is about the psychological workings of the esoteric mind.\" Ouspensky had one panegyrici st, John O'Hara Cosgrave in the Saturday Review a/ Literatu re , who wanted to fo rce the New M a del on \"every college professor and author of books and writer fo r newspapers and magazi nes.\" In the New Republic Kennet h Burke recalled the impact of Tertium Organum on his circle, but described the New Model as \"beyond 'argument. '\" For his revised version of the universe he preferred Blake or Milton. In England there was a second edition in 1934, and despite the obvious intellectual pitfalls, the book served very well what might easily be supposed to be Ouspensky's purpoSe. He had designed it fo r a popular audience and had hoped fo r a popular succ ess; indeed he was dissatisfied with the high price of the handsome Routledge volume * and wanted a cheap edition. Who would bite on the lures he had strewn about so plentif ully? He had talked in terms of religion, biology, mathemati cs, occult ism, and philosophy; he had discussed sex and politics; he had indulged the most romantic fancies of journeys to the East. Behind it all, however, was an implication that there were particular secrets to be learned. In a note prefacing the New Model, Ouspensky promised the publication of another book telling of his discoveries \"during the time from 1915 to 1919.\" Three times he referred to the existence of a \"special doctr ine accessible only to a few\" in place s where his readers might make some connection with ideas of self-devel opment. This was the opposite of the technique which he had used with his band of forty to fifty pupils in 1924. They had been given the task of distinguishing between Gurd jieff's ideas­ referred to as \"Special Doctrine\"-and the \"New Doctrine\" fo r which Ouspensky was responsible. Ouspensky once answered the question whether he had \"altered the teachi ng much\" that he had not altered it at all. He went on: \"But I pref er ... to start with the psychological side.\" He defined psychology as \"study of ones elf.\" This leads first to the recognition of t h e multiplicity of 'T s\"; and second to learning methods of self-observation -for which a man needs to know Gurd jieff's work ing diagram of the human mach ine. \"Real psychol- ... A New Model of the Universe was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul largely through the in8.uence of Herbert Read, a director of the firm. ."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCH OLOGY 399 ogy,\" Ouspensky said, begins when a man is told to \"remember himself\" and realizes that although he cannot do this in his present state , he might succeed with effort. This was the nub and axis of the System as he taught it, and even when he had led his pupils on some cosmological sally, he never tired of reminding them that \"Only with the help of the psychological study shall we really increase our knowledge; without it we shall only be learning wor ds.\" After the publication of the New Model in 1931, and still more after the second edition of 1934, recruits came in droves to Warwick Garde ns. Ouspensky instructed his pupils to approach fr iends who might respond to the System, and he began to hold meetings on more than one evening a week. In 1934 he wrote a series of introductory lectures, which were later published under the title of The Psychology of Man's Possible Evoluti on . These served both as an introduction to the ideas of Gurdjieff and- because they were frequently repeated -as a means of reminding pupils of the principles they were studying. To repeat these lectures and also to save time in answering questions about the basic · outline of the System, Ouspensky made use of his most senior pupils. These included one man who had been with him since 1924, a journalist who was one of his older fo llowers and a member of the Royal College of Physicians named Dr. Francis Ro les. At the same time Ouspensky delegated his authority to two other fo llow ers. The first was a very qualified delegation and simply involved the recognition of an already existing situation . J. G. Bennett -to whom Ouspensky was indebted fo r having arranged his visas fr om Constantino­ ple-enjoyed an ambiguous relationship with his teach er, and fr om 1925 to 1930 had no direct contact with him at all. By the summer of 1930, Bennett had establi shed a small discussion gro up which met regularly , and of whose activities he sent reports to Ouspensky. The second delegation of authority was made by Ouspensky in a quasi­ offi�ial manner. On September 9, 1931, he was talki ng to his closest pupil and friend, Maurice Nicoll. Then he said: \"Nicoll, you had better go away .... \" In the silence after his words , Nicoll was left contemplating his boots . Ouspensky completed his sentence. \"Go awa y,\" he said, \"and teach the Syst em .\" At first Nicoll's teach ing was on a very small scale and had to be combined with the demands of his prof ession as a psychiatJ:i st. His earliest pupils often fo und themselves sitting among the patients in the doctor's waiting room. The nucleu� was fo rmed by a fe w old fo llowers of Ouspensky. These brought their fr iends, and outsiders might be introduced to the regular meetings. As the number of pupils grew, Nicoll divided his gr oups. There were meetings in his consulting roo ms, in the fiats of group"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"400 THE HARM ' ONIOUS CIRCLE members, in a physical culture studio run by a devoted follower named Fulford Bush, and in a dancing school in the Finchley Road . Nicoll's experiences as a psychiatrist fitted him much better than Orage or either of the Ouspenskys to crack the whip if necessary, and it does not seem that his teach ing ever incurred the casualties inflicted by Gurd jieff and Mme. Ouspensky. The impression remains that the doctor was remarkably skillful in tempering the wind to the shorn lambs under his charge . We imagine the 1930s as a period dominated by industrial depr ession, unemployment, and mass political movements. But the slump affected intellectuals in different ways. Some turned toward the realities of this world, others withdrew from it precipita tely. Ouspensky's teaching seemed to provide a way of detach ment from the world which did not require subscription to app arently outmoded creeds. His decision to expand coincided with the beginning of the recession, and his success certainly owed something to the troubled state of Europe. It was in this psychological climate that Rom Landau wrote a bestseller, God Is My Adventure, and came himself to hear Ouspensky. In his New Stateslluln review of The Fourth Way, Rayner Heppenst all places Ouspensky's readers among that section of the avant-garde who had never been quite certain whether or not their place was in the arriere -ban: For quite a lot of people the years before Hitler's war were still dominated, not by the new Oxford communist poets, but by Cent ral European mystagogu es with more or less eye cocked on the mystic East. ... In many a Garden Suburb sitting-r oom, beside the nature cure pamphlets and the outlines of Adlerian psychology, lay a copy of Tertium Organum or A New Model of the Universe . People were bent on awakening their higher centres, emerging from the prison of mechanica lness, being at one with the One, achieving synthesis and breathing correctly. After the publication of the New Model, Ouspensky's lectures began to attract the attention of the literati . His shadowy presence in London was known to many intellectuals, and despite the secrecy of meetings at Warwick Garde ns, the departure of Orage and Ka t herine Mansfield for the Prieure had inevitably placed Ouspensky on the literary map. Although Tertium Organum never achieved the success in England which it en joyed in the United States, it had a wide circulation in Progre ssive circles; and one of its most fe rvent devotees was Mrs. Bernard Shaw. But during the 1930s the literary men who attended Ouspensky's meet ings came less"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOLOGY 401 frequently from the Prog ressive camp than from the fringes of Bloomsbury. In those high and far-off days, contact between \"intellectuals\" and \"society\" was very close, and there was still a small circle within which fa shions traveled fa st. Nicoll, with his literary connections and parties at the Cafe Royal , moved in several strata of society and was the natural choice when Edwin Muir needed psychiatric help. Kenneth Walker (d. 1966) was an eminent surgeon, fe llow of innumer able Royal Societies, and three times Hunterian Prof essor-the last two occas ions in 1922 and 1924. He was introduced to Warwick Gardens by Nicoll, whose fr iend he had been at Cambridge and whose neighbor he was in Harley Street. Walker himself was no stranger to Bloomsbury and was a fr iend of Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson. Mrs. Beatrice Mayor was a friend of the Huxleys. Her husband, R. J. G. Mayor (1869-1947), was a prominent civil servant in the Depar tment of Education and was also a fo llower of Ouspensky. He was a member of the fa mous Cambridge \"Apos tles,\" and a peripheral figure in the circle of Lytton Strach ey, who disapproved violently of his atte mpts to discover Tru th. Aldou s Huxley, Gerald Heard, and Christopher Isher wood also attended Ouspensky's lecture s; both Huxley and Heard went several times to talk with Mme . Ouspensky in the country , although they never took part in the regular Work activitie s. Some traces of Ouspensky's influence may be fo und in Heard's The Third Morality (1937), but Huxley was the most obviously affected of the group-­ although the impression remains that he reacted unfavorably to the Work, perhaps because he believed that Gurd jieff had been the cause of Katherine Mansfield's death . One obvious example of Huxley's borro wing is his use of the term \"negative emotio ns,\" which occurs in The Doors of Perception (1954), to describe the unpleasant states of mind which are acce ntuated by hallUcinogenic drugs. While he was writing his Ends and Means (1937), Huxley consulted the bookseller John M. Wat kins of Cecil Court about the sources of \"the perennial philospophy ,\" and fo llowers of Ouspensky maintain that his attendance at Ouspensky's lectures was also in the nature .of a research expedition . Certainly the argu ment, if not the details, of Ends and Means with its declaration that \"The ideal man is the non-attached man,\" is strikingly similar to what Huxley might have heard at Warwick . Gard ens. The character of Mr. Propter in Huxley's Aft er Many a Summer (19 39) is sometimes taken as a portrait of Ouspensky. Propter is a man capable of withdrawi ng from personality. His method entails helping a man to \"unlearn a lot of things he l now regarded as self-evident and right.\" In Mr. Propter's conversation can be fo und hints of Gurd jieff's \"objective moral­ ity.\" \"All personality is a prison. Potential good is anything that helps you to get out of prison .\" And in his lecturing of the \"middle-aged English"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"402 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE scholar,\" Jeremy Pordage, the reader finds a transposition into literary terms of the Ray of Creation, with its successively increas ing number of mechanical laws. \"Most of us live on the mechanical level,\" says Mr. Propter, \"where events happen in accordance with large numbers. The things we call accidental or irrelevant belong to the very essence of the world in which we elect to live.\" The promiscuousness of intellectuals toward Ouspensky did not result in a literary movement like that which Orage had inspired in the United States. The reason was Ouspensky's inflexible ban on writing about the System without his permission. When his followers asked-as they did at regular interval s-for news of when he intended to publish In Search of the Miraculou s, Ouspensky would temporize and say that it was in their interests to keep the ideas for their own work rather than to let the world into their secrets . This prohibition was extended to prevent his pupils from writing altogether. One example is that of the novelist Bernadette Murphy, who was directed to abandon her writing and become secretary to Kenneth Walker. A few stray references did escape Ouspensky's net; only in the case of Aldous Huxley was the leakage considered serious, and the faithful erupted in loud cries against plagiarism of the Work. The writing which Ouspensky did permit is so allusive as to give nothing away. Frequently it would be impossible to tell that an author had been in touch with his teaching. Robert Mayor's posthumously published Reason and Common Sense (1952) is the sort of philosophical treatise one wou1d expect from a former Fellow of King's. Beatrice Mayor's The Story without an End (1940) is a mawkish allegory of spiritual progress dealing with the attempts of Betsy , denizen of Lowlan d, to climb the Great Slope. R. R. Merton, the translator of the New Model, published a volume called Sons of the King (1940) which contains Ouspensk ian ideas filtered through a rather woolly mind. Almost nowhere is there to be found the life-giving impulse which animated the Oragea ns, and the contrast between Orage's fertilizing influence and Ouspensky's impersonation of a hen brooding on a clutch of eggs is telling. The single exception to this melancholy rule was a book published in 1936 by Kenneth Walker, whose only previous literary work had been a children's story. Called The Intru der * and subtitle d, \"an unfinished self­ portrait,\" this is an interesting attempt to base an autobiography on the doctrine of man's \"many I's.\" Walker introduces himself as his own experimental rabbit, and declares that \"the study of psychology should begin, not with the examination of the broken clockwork that is brought to the psychothera pist's consulting room, but with a careful observation of the wheels and springs of action working within one.\" He confines himself to * Later rewritten as I Talk of Dreams. ,"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOL OGY 403 observing four different \"I's,\" \"so immer sed in their dreams that they represent sleep rather than aware ness\"; but over and above his multiple ego, Walker makes out anothe r entity whom he christens \"the Intruder .\" The Intruder corresponds to what Ouspensky called \"Big I,\" and Walker sees him as the agent of that fuller consciousness which alerts him to the cavortings of the marionettes who normally manipulate his life. Just as the presence of Ouspensky in London acted as a compelling magnet for some intellectual circles, A New Model of the Universe provided a similar lodestone fo r a wider audience. In 1931, the year the New Model appe ared, Charles Williams-whose secretary, a Miss Ripman, belonged to the Work groups and so had prior knowledge of Ouspensky's ideas­ published his novel Many Dimensio ns, which contains much speculation on time and dimensions, and even a character who is trapped in a \"perpetual recurrence .\" Britain in the 1930s had developed an appe tite fo r the mysteries of time. J. W. Dunne published his Experiment with Time in 1927; and the same year Wyndham Lewis argued in Time and Western Man that time was the obsessive preoccupation of the age (and even the inspiration of Charlie Chaplin). John Buchan-adept as always at picking incipient fantasies from the void- published The Gap in the Curtain in July 1932. It is difficult to believe that he had not read the New Model and heard something of Ouspensky. The Gap in the Curtain tells of a house party at which the lion of the weekend is Prof essor August Moe. Moe selects five members of the house party for an experiment, all of whom are tired, nervous, or ill. They must not be men \"too deeply sunk in matter .\" After a period of fasting and drug taking, Moe's subjects sit holding pieces of blank paper cut to the size of the Times . The object is to visualize the text of the newspaper one year from the date when the experiment takes place; and the story is concerned with what the chara cters do with the information they receiv e. The interesting fe ature of The Gap in the Curtain is not the pseudotheory of reilding the fu ture, which is an amalgam of Dunne and Ouspensky. It is the chara cter of Prof essor August Moe. Moe is the first appearance in the popular literature of the 1930s of a charac ter who became archetypal for the decade . A brooding, powerf ul, Central European-or perhaps Scandina­ Vian-ge nius with. the ability to cast an intell ectual spell over his listeners, Prof essor Moe is a sensationalized version of Ouspensky's public image. He shares with Ouspensky the technique of presenting his case in different ways to different people; and he share s his fascination with time. Professor Moe anticipates another fictional genius: in this case one whose ideas were admittedly borrowed from , Ouspensky, and whose appearance gives sub­ stance to the idea that a vague image of Ouspensky himself formed part of the mental furniture of the late 1930s.

Ouspensky's astonishing book, A New Model of the Universe . It must be understood howe ver, that I accept full responsibility for the free use I have made of these borrowed ideas, and that it does not follow because I make use of them that I necessarily believe in them. J. B. Priestley The play is set in a lonely Yorkshire inn and the basic plot is a contemplated adulte ry. The situation is complicated by the appearance of the mysterious Dr. GortIer, hinting darkly at the theories of eternal recurre nce. Some of the characters decide that they have \"been here before .\" It emerges that GortIer has intervened to halt a succession of misfortunes which will occur if the wif e goes off with her lover. The affair will end disastrously, the lover's career will be ruined, the forsaken husband will shoot himsel f, and various subsidiary characte rs who depend on the protag onists will be caught up in the general tragedy. In the last act it appears that GortIer failed, because the lovers elope as they had dqne \"before.\" But the wife returns repentant to find that Gortler has persuaded her husband not to commit suicide. The result is that the husband is reconciled to the loss of his wife; thus saving his own lif e and her happiness, as well as the career of his wife's lover, and the well-being of those who would also have been affected. It is a neatly moral application of Ouspensky's theorie s. The play was commercially successful, and it certainly helped the sales of the New Mod el . A common reaction must have been that of David Hughes in his book on J. B. Priestley: \"One cannot help being intereste d,\" he writes; \"however much, fo r the sake of intellectual dignity, you pretend to wriggle in your seat, the attention is held throughout the piece, and you go away from the theatre muttering comments that sound vaguely like threa ts, determined to have a look at Ouspensky and see what possible truth it conta ins, even if you stick at the first thirty pages .\" In Warwick Gardens there were outraged cries about plagiari sm which Ouspen sky met with equani mity. He was used, he said, to people stealing his ideas. Although Priestley had freely ackn owledged his Source, he never succeeded in meeting Ouspensky, who regarded him as a potential mena ce to security. But the impact of the New Model had a lasting influence in turning"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOLOGY 405 Priestley's mind toward the books of Gurd jieff, Ouspensky, and Nicoll, with results which became apparent in his later fiction. Behind the mystery-making which produced such excellent entertain­ ments, Ouspensky's reputation grew. Regarded by outsiders as a myste­ rious underground eminence, he was increasingly revered by his disciples, and the strange sort of success he enjoyed by proxy in the personae of Prof essor Moe and Dr. Gortler, may unconsciously have colored the pupils' images of the Master. The notoriety which the New Model and Ouspensky's lectures brought the Work resulted in a further increase in the number of people who wanted to spend weekends under the eagle eye of Mme. Ouspensky at Gadsden. In the autumn of 1935, a larger house was taken at Virginia Water in Surrey. This was Lyne Place , a sizable Regency building with a fa rm. Perhaps harking back to the Tolstoyan fashions of his youth, Ouspensky decided that Lyne should be as self-supporting as possible. His pupils work ed: making hay, growing fruit and vegetabl es, and keeping bees, with the dual objects of producing fo od and generating the friction which their discipline demanded. Later on, clas ses were held in Gurd jieff's move­ ments. Some twenty people lived in Lyne Place itself, others bought houses in Virg inia Water, and by 1938 about a hundred people were arriving to work on Sundays. This expa nsion brought with it eff ects which some of the older pupils noted with chag rin, among them, Kenneth Wal ker: One ofthe most obvious losses was that because we were now so many, we saw much less of the two Ouspenskys. This meant that we received less personal guidance from them, and were left more to our own devices. We were no longer a big fa mily, but were now acquiring the attrib utes of an Institute. Yes, the older amongst us were forced to accept the fact that we had lost something by becoming bigger. Lyne Place was organized with the mixture of elegance and austerity which was the Ouspensky trademark. Visitors complained of an atmosphere of tension. One was even convinced that the regime was vege tarian-which was not true, although the impression can be explained in terms of its puritan association s. Little conversation at meals, no laugh ter, the deadly seri ousness of the pupils immersed in their struggle s to \"self-re member\"; this was undoubtedly one aspect of the life at Lyne Place . In contras t, if there was a celebration of some kind, no expense was spar ed: Ouspensky enjoyed large , fo rmal dinner parties, and his country house provided an excellent setting. c. S. Nott visited Lyne Place in the late 1930s, and found the Ouspenskys comf ortably established. He had the impression that despite all"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"406 THE HARMONIOU S CIRCLE . the outward trappings of success, Ouspen sky-who was drinking heavily­ was living in the past. This is an accusation also made by J. G. Bennett in connection with a drinking session in 1933: \"He then had the habit of sitting up half the night drinking claret and, nearly alway s, of talking about his own early days in Russia. He seemed to have been obsessed with the need to put himself back into the life he was living before he met Gurdjieff in 1915.\" This may have been so; but Ouspensky's manner of teaching and the material he used made him live not so much in the past as in a sort of continuing present. By the very fact that he was teaching a system which resulted from his time with Gurdjieff, he had created a kind of canonical period and ceaselessly reconcentrated his mind on its events. This impreSSion was intensified for his pupils through readings from the typescript of In Search of the Miraculous . By inviting people to enter his private psychological world in the New Model, Ouspensky created around him an atmosphere which reinforced the Russian associations of the New Model's subject matter-which came chiefly from the years between 1908 and 1912. As he gradually gave more prominence to his personal ideas, his pupils heard of the role of the devil in preventing human evolution, discussed Ouspensky's theory of an \"esoteric school\" which had inspired Ibsen, Rossetti, and Alexis Tolstoy, and practiced exercises of \"repetition\" and \"stopping thoughts\" with which their teacher had experimented long before. For them Ouspensky's own search was a historical glyph ; yet that search had not ended, and perhaps Ouspensky had begun to look bac k toward the direction in which he had first set out. The impression that he was disappointed in the results of his personal quest is given by another story told by Bennett, whose wife had an interview with Ouspensky soon after she recovered from an overdose of drugs. The tale of her ecstatic experiences when close to death brought Ouspensky to the verge of tears. He told her that since his youth he had been hoping for such an experience but that he had remained un­ enlightened. A sense of having been cheated by fate may have lain at the back of his increasing dogmat ism. It had always been a feature of his charact er to entrench himsel f in strange positions, and as the 1930s wore on, his stubbornness grew. One frequent source of conflict was provided b� Ouspensky's views on evolution. In the New Model he describes the . universe as a \"Great Laboratory .\" He believed devoutly in the inheritance of acquired charac­ teristics and argued that certain forms of life had been created solely to develop a particular charac teristic which was needed fo r the creation of the culminating life form-man . Man was the prize exhibit in the laboratory. fo r he was nature's attempt to manufacture a self-evolving creatu re."},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOL OGY 407 Ouspensky followed a bizarre but common occult theory that animals are degenerated men-perhaps failed experim ents. He had some equally unorthodox ideas about personal evoluti on. Three categories of men were distinguished according to sexual behavior: men of supra�sex, infra�sex and normal sex. Humans afHicted by infra�sex were symptoms of race�degeneration ; and among these Ouspensky included both the sex�obsessed and the sexually \"abnormal\" of any descripti on. Beings of supra�sex were those who had mastered the art of transmuting the sex� energy into a means of personal evolution , and Ouspensky printed a list of the \"thirty-two signs of Budd ha-hood\"-actually deriving from a Chinese astrological manual-as an indication of what these supermen might look like. From his earliest days in Lond on, Ouspensky's refusal to admit orthodox concepts of evolution had brought him into conflict with his more scientifically trained fo llowers . His views on the sexually \"abnormal\" were unshaka ble; \"and may,\" one former pupil writes, \"have been genuinely naive .\" In answer to a question about homosexuality , he once replied that he knew very little about it, because it did not exist in Russia; and in A New Model of the Universe he inveighs against psychoanaly sis fo r providing a justification fo r homosexuals. Such traits belong to the caricature reaction­ ary, and it is evident that Ouspensky intensely and increasingly disliked his own time. It would be wrong to see this as a blind revulsion from a world which had turned against him. What was happening was that the psycholog­ ical method had got out of hand. Ouspensky even used the latter to justify his hatred of Bolshev ism. In A New Model of the Universe there is a chapter called \"Eternal Recurrence . and the Laws of Manu ,\" in which Ouspensky couples his theory of recurrence to the caste divisions laid down by Hindu tradition. These laws, he said, represented \"an ideal social organisation in accordance with esoteric systems\" because the division into fo ur castes of Bra hmins (priests and schola rs), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaisyas (merchan ts), and Sudras (servant s), was a natural division. Whether people liked it or not, they belonged to one or another of these classes. A man might move up a caste the next time around the circle of recurrence . Here Ouspensky could not have differed more from Gurdji eff, who denounced the \"maleficent castes\" of society . Ouspensky admitted that modern society offered no examples of \"correct\" division into castes. But \"the most brilliant periods of history\" occurred by accident when the social order approached the caste system yet still allowed some flexibility . One of these periods had been \"the beginning of the 20th century in Russi a.\" Ouspensky appeared to regard the Russian intelligentsia as potential Bra hmins, characterized by the wish fo r \"disinterested activity\" and \"personal freedom .\" This is really an"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"408 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE adaptation of his early presentiment that he belonged to \"a new race of men.\" In the 1931 edition of the New Model, Ouspensky incorporated a long note denouncing the \"pseudo-intelligentsia, \" a class he described as \"the worst, outcaste element of Vaisyas and Sudras .\" He charact erized these-still using the Russi an example and obviously with the Bolsheviks in mind -as intellectuals \"who do not become the intelligentsia\"; that is, intellectuals who disagreed with his concept of the role of an \"intelligent.\" By the time the second edition of the New Model appeared three years later, Ouspensky had obviously come under fire about this rather strange sociological theory. He altered the text of his chapter on the Laws of Manu, but inserted a new preface-wh ose purpose was chiefly to explain his ideas of the \"psychological method\" -a further condemnation of Bolshevis m. It appeared that, according to the psychological method, Bolshevism was evil incarna te. But the merely \"Iogical \"-as opposed to \"psycholo gical\"-m ind would never see this. The man of logical mind who demands proof s for everything . . . looks fo r the cause of the world economic and political crisis everywhere except where it actually lies. And even if he were told that the causes . . . lie in the existence of the Soviet government in Russia, and in the recognition and support of this gover nment by other governments, he would never understand it. He is accustomed to think in a certain way and he is unable to think differently. For him the bolsheviks are a \"political party\" like any other party, and the Soviet Government is a \"government\" like any other government. He is unable to see that this is a new phenomenon different from anything he knew before. Where are the proof s of this? he would ask. And he will never see that this needs no proofs .... \"proofs\" are by no means always necessary in order to accept or to deny a given prop osition. There are \"psychological proof s\" which mean much more than facts because fa cts can lie and psychological proofs cannot lie. But one must be able to feel them. Why must one be able to feel them? The answer is because Ouspensky felt them. Because he regarded Bolshevism as. the dominance of the criminal element in humanity and its leaders as renegade Brahm ins, the psychological method-supported by esotericism -dictated that everyone else must feel this too. Ouspen sky made a rule for his followers about not becoming involved in \"criminal politics\" -which included not only fascism and Communism but the English Labour Party . This bore heavily on some of his followers -for example, Bennett, who had been offered a parli amen­ tary seat by Ramsay MacDonald."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOL OGY 409 Dogmati sm did not matter when Ouspensky was teaching the System, because he faithfully insisted that his followers must verify everyth ing for themselv es. But it came to mean an increasingly dictatorial attitude toward more general matters. For example, Kenneth Walker, besides being a surgeon, was one of the pioneers of popular sexology, and in 1940 published one of the first paperback books on sex. Then on one occasion at Lyne it was discovered that he had given a young Ouspen skian advice on some sexual problem. Ouspensky's rage was colossa l-although it appeared to have little impact on a blandly smiling Walker. The influx of new disciples had repercussions for Ouspensky's London lecture s. By the autumn of 1937, he found himself overwhelmed with meetings, and told his senior pupils that they must share the burd en. Apart from delegating some of the routine work, he wanted to devote more time to writing. He was becoming anxious that he had not published anything fo r a long time and needed to keep his name before the public. He also had to find a larger house for the meetings, if possible with a hall where Gurd jieff's movements could be taught. By the spring of 1938 the problem had been solved. The building which Ouspen sky and his followers acquired is known as Colet House and stands in Colet Gardens opposite the old site of St. Paul's School. It had belonged to the ballet school of Nicholas Legat whose wife, Nadine Legat, was a pupil of Ouspensk y and had evolved a gymnastic form of dancing incorporating Gurdjieffian principles of self-ob servation. The large hall was ideal for the movements, and there was ample room to hold much larger meetings. Ouspensky moved a private press, belonging to one of his pupils, into the basement where it fu nctioned as a means of \"work\" with a particularly pointed moral. For when the proof s were pulled-in the words of a pupil who was concerned in the project- \"every literal [misprint] was an unmist akable example of sleep. \" Ouspensky insisted that this enlargement of his activities should have some outward cover to satisfy the police that nothing subversive was in progr ess. The result was the formation of a society called the \"Hist orico­ Psychological Society ,\" whose numbers were fixed at 300. The committee consisted of the two Ouspenskys, some half dozen supporters from Lyne, and a strong medical lobby from the Harley Street district, including Kenneth Walker and Dr. Francis Roles. Other members were the journalist who had taken meetings for Ouspensky and Robert Mayor who acted as librarian and treasurer. The Society's objects again hint at a vision of \"real psycholog y\": 1) The study of problems of evolution of man and particularly the idea of psycho-trans fo rmism . 2) The study of psychological schools in different histor ical periods and"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"410 THE HA RMONIOUS CIRCLE in different countrie s, and the study of their influence on the moral and intellectual develop ment of humanity. 3) Practical investigation of methods of self-study and self-develop­ ment according to principles and methods of psychological schools. 4) Research work in the history of religi ons, of philosophy, of science and of art with the object of establishing their common origin where it can be found and different psychological levels in each of them. Under this rather unwieldy umbrella, Ouspensky's organization took shape . By 1938 he seemed to have atta ined much of what he had set out to achieve fo r his \"third line of wor k. \" If Gurd jieff's Institute had fai led, Ouspensky now had a subs tantial London base and an organizational framework; while at Lyne his wife put his pupils through the hoops about which he told them theoretically. Despite the hints that he was a disappointed man, Ouspensky had many more material advantages than he could have hoped fo r twenty years earlier. He had an estate where he lived the life of a country gentleman and indulged his hobbies. He kept horses and his increasingly portly figure was a fam iliar sight in the saddle. He made a collection of antique firearms and held sessions of target pract ice. His sense of irony prevented him from taking his organization too seriously. Neither did he encourage uncritical adoration of hims elf. Once at a meeting he had a question about \"invisibili ty\"-had he ever been \"invisi­ ble\"? he was asked. Ouspensky replied cuttingly that he could tell them anything he liked and they would still have to believe him. It was the same with people who tried to invest him with miraculous pow ers. Neverth eless some did so, and the circumstances surrounding his death were to give them cause to reassert their opinions. \"Ouspensky had powers ,\" one young disciple wrote . \"He kept his powers hidden, howev er, and they were manif ested only very rare ly, and then most subtly and never fo r show. His integrity in these and other matters was absolute , and he was incorrupti­ ble.\" If there is something of Dr. Gortler and Prof essor Moe in this picture of Ouspensky, it is an image which was common to a number of his pupils. In contrast, while magical powers never seem to have been attributed to Mme. Ouspensky, she was not averse to a certain amount of adora tion. This may have gath ered about her by associat ion; fo r although Ouspensky sometimes discussed religious topics with his pupils, and went everywhere acco mpanied by a \"much-thumbed New Testa ment,\" he drew a definite boundary between religion and the System. This was not true of his wife. During the weekends at Lyne, she would organize readings fr om the sayings of Buddha, or the Sufi poet Rumi, or the Russian compilation of the Fathers known as the Philokalia, which she had translated into English by"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"REAL PSYCHOL OGY 411 Mme. Kadloub ovsky-all of which she accompanied by a comment ary pointing out the resemblances to the System. People best remember the Ouspenskys as they were in 1938 and 1939. These were the great days, when their work was outwardly successful, and apparently harmonious . But the distinct separation between Ouspensky's personal following and \"Madam's people\" encouraged some internal dissension and faction fighting. One recurrent problem was that of Mme. Ouspensky's grandson, who lived with the community at Lyne . He made incessant demands on the patience of the Ouspenskys' pupils, and many thought Mme. Ouspensky blind to his faults. However, to some of \"Madam's people ,\" Lonya's behavior seemed to be yet another deliberate provocation in the sense of the Work. Ouspensky himself admitted that his step-grandchild was a thorough nuisance, but in this-as in other matters-allowed himself to be swayed by his wife. Ouspensky's difficulties were compounded by his wife's taking to her bed. He discussed her illness with a psychiatrist pupil and both concluded that the cause was a fo rm of neurasthenia. Yet even though she spent an increasing amount of time in her room, Mme. Ouspensky's influence grew increasingly powerf ul, and Ouspensky came under attack fo r his appare nt subservience. Maurice Nicoll once visited Gadsden and once Lyne fo r special celebratio ns; and on both occas ions-af ter a large quantity of drink was consumed-Nicoll became highly critical . At Gadsden, the evening ended with Nicoll, Ouspensky, and a s.enior pupil of Ouspensky's drinking togethe r. Nicoll stated \"violently\" that Ouspensky had \"gone soft\" and was too much under his wife's influence. He tried unsucces sfully to persuade the third man present to break with Ouspensky and start a group of his own. It is known that Nicoll kept in touch with Gurdjieff despite the appearance of complete separatio n. Was this a fu rther act in the play? Was Nicoll playing Judas in his tum? Or was his role that of the slave who rode in the chariot of the Roman Emperor whispering: \"You too are morta!\"? Certainly , there was a suggestion of the ·imperial about the Ouspenskys in the late 1930s. They enjoyed the status which had belonged to Gurdjieff in the early days at Fontainebleau . The contrast between their circumstances and those of their old Master was considera ble. It might almost be seen-by those eyes peering at the histori cal glyph-as a morality ."},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"12 The Bone Benea th the Mount ain Gurd jieff's coup de theatre of 1931 nearly wrecked his work altogether. His material fortunes had been closely bound up with those of Orage ; and most of his remaining pupils had been Orage 's also. Although his appare nt ill­ treatm ent of his leading henchman did not of itself result in many defections, it introduced an element of doubt into the Master's relati ons with his American followers which had not been present when the persuasive Englishman had been available as mediator. To those in close touch with Gurdji eff, there was really little doubt that there was \"business as usual.\" He carried his personal atmosphere around with him, and on his visits to New York the hotels in which he stayed were crowded with the apparatus of Oriental cookin g. He rose early-a bout 6 or 7 A.M.- and spent the morning writing in the Childs restaurants which he used as \"offices .\" Then he went shopping for the ingredients of an exotic lunch. The meal, with its accompa niment of vodka and apple jack, might last till about 2:30, after which Gurdj ieff would rest for an hour. In the evening he would return to Childs and perhaps again play host to his pupils at dinner, prolonging the session into the small hours by recita tions on his hand organ . Some former Orageans remember farewell ceremonies for Orage instig­ ated by Gurdjieff both in New York and at the Prieure. There was a general impression that no division of interests separated the teacher and his pupil. 412"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN 413 Yet Orage had gone; and he had certainly expr essed some doubts about his old Master to several of his American pupils. Because Gurdjieff now had to take responsibility fo r raising money hims elf, this meant trips to the United States at least once a year between 1930 and 1934. Personal contact with Gurd jieff in his role of sheep-shearer naturally increased whate ver doubts a pupil might have had about entrusting himself to an \"esoteric teach er.\" Seen from the New World, Gurd jieff's fo rtunes appeared to be undergoing a rapid decline. In England historical circumstances seemed to play into the hands of the Ouspenskys. In America, although Gurd jieff quite obviously expected the Depression to bring many more recru its to the Work, economic hardship and uncertainty had precisely the opposite effect. This may have been partly because Orage 's success in New York was associated with the sort of intellectual attitudes which came to be considered particularly \"Twe n­ tiesish\"-the complex of humanism, hedonism, and unorthodox psychology which Edmund Wilson denounced. In England, Ouspensky escaped identification with outmoded attitu des becau se he had begun on a very small scale. But the early successes of Orage in New York effectively discredited Gurd jieff's ideas fo r Americans of the 1930s. There was no one to replace Orage , although several small groups came into existence under directors like Schuyler Jacks on. A number of Gurd­ jieff's leading fo llowers in the New York area fo rmed a \"Commi ttee fo r the New York Group ,\" which took on the thankle ss task of trying to organize financial support fo r their prodigal Master. But after Orage's final depar­ ture, the most senior \"pupil-teacher\" of Gurd jieff's ideas in the United States was Jean Toomer in Chicago . It was during 1931 and 1932 that . Toomer emer ged with a personal initiative which attracted widespread notice, as it was linked to a romantic and tragic development in his personal life. The expedition which he made to Fontainebleau in 1929 was to prove his last. Next year Gurd jieff visited the group in Chicago , and Too mer himself visited New York and Montreal. In 1931 he did not meet Gu rdjieff, and the . Toomer papers provide little information about his activit ies; but he once more appeared in print fo r the first time at any length since the publication of Cane . Toomer's Essentials was issued privately in Chicago . Its author described it as \"some 300 crystallizations in words of observations and understandings which have arisen in me during a five-year period .\" The book is a collection of aphori sms and would probably be inacce ssible to anyone unfamiliar with Gurd jieff's ideas. \"We have many reformers, few transf orm ers,\" Too mer w rote; and \"We want to be free from the things we want .\" There is: something about the Work which encourages its devot ees to make epigram s"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"414 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE about it. Jane Heap was another coiner of phra ses; and the idea may be to provide mnemonics or texts to be mulled over. Those contained in Essentials are often well-turned or witty and provide enduring food for thoug ht. \"While an increasing number of materia lists are committing suicide because they believe they have no soul ,\" Toomer procla imed, \"an increas ing number of spiritualists are going crazy because they believe they have one.\" There is much more in the same vein, and no single aphorism could be chosen as displaying the theme of the book. But one short passage , less epigrammatic than many, does seem to provide an indication of how Toomer had come to understand the Work. He wrote that he saw the emergence of a new type of man, a \"psychological type .\" \"This is a psychological adventurer: one who, having had the stock experiences of mankind, sets out at right angles to all previous experience to discover new states of being.\" There are no detailed records of how Toomer conducted his groups in Chicago . Fritz Peters met his pupils in the autumn of 1931 when they numbered about twenty-five and was not impressed by their quality . \"They seemed to me to have been attracted to his teach ing for a variety of not very good reasons-because of lonelines s, or perhaps because they considered themselves misf its or outcas ts. Most of them had dabbled in the arts, theosophy , the occult or something of the sort, and had come to Gurdjieff as if in search of another 'cure' for their life problems ... \" Toomer' s meeti � gs consisted of readings from Beelzebub's Tales followed by discussions in which the participan ts tried to relate the book to their personal situatio ns. Gurd jieff's \"impartially objective criticism of the life of man\" became a justific ation for anything avant-garde . \"Any radical social behavior became almost automatically justified,\" Peters write s, \" ... the prevailing attitude of this particular group of followers was that of substituting new values for old by rote.\" What is clear is that Toomer's group had struck out on their own line; and this was not very acceptable to a fundamentalist. For two months in the summer of 1931, Toomer lived with several members of his group in a three-room cottage at Portage , Wisco nsin. He began with four of his closest associate s, and on weekends the numbers were increased to thirty by the addition of other pupils from Chicago and some interested locals. To the newspapers he described the object of his summer at Portage-s till hazily referred to by literary historians as \"a cottage experiment\" -as being \"to keep a number of , intellectual' men and 'intellectual' women in close proximity and observe the psychological effec ts.\" Among his group were a bank cashier, a salesman, a report er, a clubw oman, a justice of the peace , and a businessman. There was also a native of Portage named Margery Latimer. She had first become interested"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOU NTAIN 415 in Orage's groups in New York and had joined Jean Toomer's in Chicago when she returned to Portage from leading the literary life. Margery Latimer was a promising young writer, the author of We Are Incredible (1928) and the even more highly regarded Nellie Bloom and Other Stories (1929), which contains several traces of Gurd jieff's influence. She was probably responsible fo r the site chosen by Toomer for his experiment; and also fo r igniting a fresh spark of interest in Portage's most celebrated lady of letters and her own literary godmother: Zona Gale. Zona Gale invited the townsf olk of Portage to her home to hear Toomer lecture and succeeded in arousing a degree of interest. A few sober citizens were persuaded to at tend talks which Toomer delivered in the woods nearby, but a small number of interested locals did not prevent rumors circulating about the doings in the cottage by the river. About a year after the experiment, a reporter from the San Francisco State Journal interviewed the acting Chief of Police in Portage . Did he remember Jean Toomer? \"Yes,\" said the chief , puffing at his pipe. \"I remember him well. Tall fe llow, pretty dark. Yesh, we had an idea he was part Negro all right. Lots of people here did.\" \"What kind of place did he run, chief?\" The chief thought for a moment and replied: \"I don't know much about it, but from reports we got there was some damn fu nny things going on out there. He was some kind of philosopher. 1 never did figure it out.\" Over in the corner a man, hidden behind a newspa per, suddenly said: \"Why 1 heard they were climbing trees out there just like squirr els. \" \"Yes sir,\" the chief said solemnly, \"just like squirrels .\" Apart from climbing trees and shocking the bourgeoisie, what was Toom er doing? He called the account he wrote of the episodes \"Portage Potential ,\" and subtitled it \"An adventure in human developmen t.\" He constantly empha­ sizes that the experiment was his personal creati on: \"I was building a world. I was creating a form. It was to be my own.\" His methods bore some relat ionship to those of Gurd jieff but are recognizably original . He introduced games-d eck tennis and swimming in the nearby river -which provided excell � nt mateliial for observing the nature s of group members. He named the members responsible for various activities---c ooking or housework-\"Chiefs\" (and how did they respond to the suggestion of authori ty?). He delivered lectures on the particular sort of tail which each <Jf"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"416 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE his pupils possessed. Short and curly? Twisted? Diabolically straight? His contribution was intended to be more than simply personal; Toomer being who he was, with a particular interest in creating Americans out of a bouillaba isse of peoples, saw it as a particularly American form. \"The Portage cottage was a nurser y school, and we its members. It was a school fo r Ame ricans-a place where those who had been conditioned by America could work the bad of America out, the good of America in, and become human beings of the given types as developed in Americ a.\" He had at last begun to give expre ssion to the ideas of a nation of regenerated men which he had absorbed from Waldo Frank. It is a great loss that \"Portage Potential\" has never been published; it is unique in portraying the uncertainties and extemporizations on the part of the teacher as well as the reaction of the pupils to the shocks he administers. From the tea cher's side, it is clear that some of the most powerf ul effects he produces are unintentional. Toomer admits that one talk he delive red-chiefly on \"negative emotions\" -had a completely unfore­ seen impact upon Margery Latimer. In the typescript she is referred to as \"Marion Kilburn .\" The eff ect of this talk was experienced most by Marion Kilburn; and in her there was produced a series of experiences considerably beyond anything that I had planned or could possibly have controlled. The results in her, indeed, came about only because my, for me concise fo rmulatio ns, but for her more than random shots, happened to crystallize materials fo r certain experience s, materials gathered by her unusual person over a number of years . Judging by the list of testimonials from his pupils which Toomer attached to the text of \"Portage Potential\" he succeeded in inducing experiences of great intensity in a considerable number of people. He concluded that his experiment had shown four things: \"That through self-knowledge man can become man\"; \"the possibility of chang e\"; that \"people can be consciously energized\"; and that it was possible 'to create a \"conscious form\" in which all these things could take place . For public consumption he put it more simply: \"As a result of the experi ment,\" he told a reporte r, \"I am satisfied that it is entirely possible to eradicate the false vene�r of civiliza tion, with its unnatural inhibitions, its selfishness, petty meanness and unnatural behavior , under proper conditi ons. Adults can be reeducated to become as natural as little children, before civilization stamps out their true sub­ conscious instincts .\" This sort of language was not calculated to soothe the critics who suspected that, without the veneer of civilizat ion, moral anarchy would"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOU NTAIN 417 break loose. By the time this interview appear ed, Too mer had come under heavy fire. As the summer of 1931 passed, the curiosity of the local press increa sed. It was hinted that the inmates of the cottage fo rmed a \"free love\" colony, and increasingly vicious attacks were made on Toomer's Negro ance stry. Whether or not Fritz Peters is right in attributing deliberate flouting of convention to the members of the Chicago group, Too mer's associates were certainly used to more Bohemian standards of behavior than the citizens of Porta ge; and Too mer's own attrac tiveness to women had bef ore 1931 led to awkward situati ons. The result of the Portage exper iment as far as the outside world was concerned was to make Toomer notorious as an arcanely corrupt \"philosopher\" -although few readers of the many newspaper reports can have approached an accurate conception of what the experiment had been about. In October 1931, Too mer and Margery Latimer were married in Portage . Baulked of their free love scandal, the press began to make life in the town increasingly unpleasant fo r the Too mers and their protectre ss, Zona Gale. Everywhere the couple went they had to face hostile inquisitions from reporte rs. Even six months later, on their arrival in the artists' colony at Carmel, Calif ornia, they were subjected to a barrage of questions on the Portage experi ment. How had chaperonage been observed? Did they believe in nudism? And pounding away beneath the more salacious speculati ons was the drumbeat of a manuf actured public opinion demand­ ing the ostracism of the Too mers fo r marrying across the color line. It is considered that this persecution helped to cause Margery Latimer's early death, which took place in 1932 after she had given birth to a daught er. Her husband called the child \"Margery\" and dedicated \"Portage Potential\" to \"Ma rgery of Portage .\" \"Portage Potential\" was finished in the autumn of 1931. But no publisher would accept it, and on February 9, 1932, Too mer wrote to Gorham Muns on asking his opinion of the manuscript and enclosing the verdict of one publisher's reader: \"I believe very deeply that since Cane (which had genius in it) you have traversed the wrong roa d.\" In the correspondence which fo llow ed, Munson's ob jections amounted to a request that Toomer suppress his work fo r political reas ons. He disliked the testimonials which Toomer had appended to the book and advised his friend to cut all reference to emotional entanglements between members of the Portage group . He wrote fo rcefully about the unwisdom of mentioning Gurd jieH\" s name in connlection with the experi ment. Too mer had loyally avoided connecting his unpopular activities with Gurd jieH' in any interviews he gave to the press, but evidently fe lt that he could scarcely write a book about his summer colony with no mention of the source of his ideas. As it"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"418 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE turned out, Portage Potential remained unpublished, although its author formally registered the copyri ght. He may have been influenced by Munson's urgent appeals against trying again fo r publication after a lapse of time. From Munson's description of Gurd jieff's reputation in New York, his advice was just ified. Muns on also hinted that renegades from the Work were causing trouble fo r Gurd jieff' s loyal supporte rs. The sort of rumors spread by disillusioned Gurd jieffians can easily be imagined. Fritz Peters has recorded several incidents which blackened Gurd jieff' s reputat ion. Two of these were the result of his unorthodox medi cal treatm ents. In one case Gurd jieff prescribed a limited amount of alcohol fo r a woman supposed to be a semi-a lcoholic on the grounds that without it she would die. Her doctor had fo rbidden her to drink as part of his treatm ent fo r another illness and was naturally furious when he discovered that his patient had fo rsaken him for an illicit medical prac titioner. He restored the regime of abstinence , and the woman duly died. A second cause celebre concerned another woman who was dying in the hospital . Gurdjieff diagnosed her trouble simply as a death wish and prescribed enemas of olive oil which she was to administer herself with a syringe smuggled into the ward . Supposedly this was to remove a particularly vile fo rm of constipation fr om which the patient suff ered; in fact-as Gurdjieff might well have intend ed-the syringe was discovered qy the hospital author ities. When the woman eventually left the hospital , she bitterly attacked Gurd jieff fo r causing trou ble. Gurd jieff on his side claimed that he had now given her cause to live-by provoking her to a positive hatred . Of course it is easy to claim responsibility after the event; and it may be wondered whether Gurd jieff's olive oil enemas did not fall into the same category as Orage's stout and oysters. But although he may occas ionally have been driven to prescribe unlikely remedies by the clamor of his disciples, as the decade wore on-and particularly after 1933--- Gurd jieff came increasingly to rely on his unorthodox medical treatm ents as a source of income. He has alway s had his advocates as a physician, and during the later 1930s, he was virtually supported by contributions from one young American who had arrived at the Prieure to be cured of a drug addict ion. The role of the physician-hypnotist which had served him so well in Turkestan , Constantinople, and Paris, was transferred to New York. Peters remembers Gurd jieff's complaints that, because of lack of interest on the part of his disciples, he was forced to earn money for hims elf. At this time he was living in a fifth-rate hotel, and the ambivalent tone of his activities depressed the young man who had known him as the Master of the Chateau du Prieure. \"I was glad ,\" he writes, \"when he emer ged from this rather"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOU NTAIN 419 woebegone charac terization of a kind of quack doctor living in shoddy circumstances. \" This progressive deterioration in Gurdjieff's circumstances was just beginning when Gorham Munson advised against the publication of Portage Potential in 1932. A more serious cause fo r concern was provided by rumors of his sexual misdemeanors. Along with the usual stories of women being invited to his hotel room at unlikely hours of the night, there was a dinner party to which Gurdjieff asked a number of reporters and writers. Before the party he persuaded Fritz Peters to \"teach\" him all the most Anglo­ Saxon terms he knew fo r sexual activity-although afterward it appeared that he not only knew the fo ur-letter vocabulary well, but had played this scene with other people. During the dinner party Gurdjieff subtly switched roles from that of perf ect host to that of satyr, making use of the coarsest expre ssions he had been \"taug ht.\" The result was the beginning of an orgy. Gurdjieff eventually stopped proce edings by ridiculing his guests and directing them to see from their conduct what they really were. He told them that, as this was an important lesson, he deserved to be paid; and according to Peters collected several thousand dollars . Such proceedings were open to grave misund erstandings. But one specific case brought home to America the possibile consequences of Gurd jieff's capac ity to inspire devotion. This concerned a young woman who met him in Chicago and fo llowed him to New York. She was considered a \"semi-i nvalid,\" and was evidently crippled by shyness and fe elings of inadequacy. According to Peters, Gurdjieff told his associates that he could both help the girl with her problems and cure her infatuati on. However, the girl's family arrived from Chicago, accused Gurdjieff of seducing their daughter and had her committed to a mental hospital . In the hospital the girl committed suicide. Gurd jieff's fo llowers split into two camps; and at the instig ation of his opponents, the Master was imprisoned fo r several days on Ellis Island. His supporters finally secured his release, but Gurd jieff had to return to France , and later fo und it difficult to reenter the United States. The steady decline of Gurd jieff's reputation extended over several years. After the excitements ofl930-3 1, the New York group had been prepared fo r anything when Gurdjieff arrived fo r the winter of 1931-32, and it was in tones of amaze ment and relief that Gorham Munson described the visit to Toomer in Chicago . Gurdjieff was affable, approachable and open. This extraordinary improvement was maintained right up until his departure on the Bremen on January 16, 1932. If Gurdjieff had been intent on papering over the cracks caused by the fracas of the previous winter, he seems partly to have succeeded, although Munson, fo r one, had no illusions about the purpose of his Master's visit. As he wrote to Toomer, Gurdjieff announced"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"' 420 THE HARMONI OUS CIRCLE his departure imme diately after securing what he had come for. As in the days of Orage , sheep-shearing took priority over enlightenment. Next winter Gurd jieff was again in the United States and visited New York and Chicago. The trip of 1932-33 marks the point at which relati ons between him and his American followers began to deteriorate in earne st, and several were driven away filled-in Toomer's words-\"with disgust and anger and the conviction that he was using his power merely in order to obtain money, money and more money without cease.\" Money was urgently needed. In the spring of 1933 a shocking telegram arrived in New York announcing that Gurdjieff was \"absolutely destitute\" and that the Prieure was about to be sold. Nothing could be done, for Gurdjieff had exhausted not only the patience of his fo llowers but the fund of goodwill on which they in turn could draw. Toomer was approach ed by the New York \"Committee\" about the large gift made by Mabel Luhan, for which he had acted as trustee in 1926, and replied that \"the sum no longer exists .\" He did not state how the money had been spent, but most of it must have dribbled from the publication fund into the coffers of the Prieure. The Gurd jieff who arrived to winter in New York in 1933-34 was a man with all the accoutrements of failure. The noisome reputation he had gathered, the seedy appearance of his doctor ing and hypnotizing, the feeling that the Prieure and the good days were now in the past, all contributed to a slightly unhealthy atmosphere which impressed itself o n some of those who met him. It seemed undeniable that his health was poor-he already looked terrible in the winter of 1932-33-and he had grown very fat. He had totally confused his pupils by publishing a strange book called Herald of Coming Good . As far as the public was concerned, the image of Gurdjieff the ogre was in the ascendant. Rom Landau flew the Atlantic to see him and was almost frightened out of his wits. Before his interview he had lunch with an American writer who had followed the progr ess of the Work for several years and who confirmed Landau's worst suspicions with an extraordinary piece of gossip. Landau's informant had last seen Gurdjieff at a reception in the spring of 1933. He had been sitting at a table with a woman friend, a novelist. * Gurdjieff caught her eye and began to breathe in and out in a peculiar fashion. 'The novelist turned pale. After a few minutes, she recovered and admitted to him that whatever Gurd jieff had been doing had \"struck her right through her sexual center.\" In plainer language, she had been given an orgasm by remote control. Landau's visit to the Great Northern Hotel on West 57th Street where Gurd jieff was living proved sufficiently alarming. He was admitted to the * Landau does not name either of the charac ters, but the man was probably Bragdon and the woman Zona Gale."},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNTA IN 421 Master's shabby rooms by a young man with eyes which \"glowed feverishly\" and who gave the journalist the impression of \"having just seen a ghost.\" The interview with Gurd jieff went badly. Landau was discom­ posed by having unwanted cigarettes pressed on him, and Gurdjieff clearly did not intend to answer his questions. Even worse, the journalist appeared to be falling under some \"hypnotic influence\" or \"electric emanation\" which deprived him of the power to move from his chair and gave him a fe eling of \"acute nervousness\" in the pit of his stomach. Gurd jieff looked \"the perf ect Levan tine, evasive in his answers, hyperbolical and anxious as to what effect he was producing .\" Released from his psychic disablement, Landau was sent home with a copy of Herald of Coming Good . After the encounter, he returned to his hotel where he \"felt a strong desire to wash my hands. I washed them in very hot water fo r about five minutes, and then fe lt better .... \" Gurd jieff could not be washed away by soap and wat er. He might be temporarily cast down; his appearance might have deteriorat ed; but even at his seediest, a taste of the old mastery was still in evidence. Claude Bragdon caught a glimpse of him in early 1934 through the plate glass window of the Hecksher Building Childs Restaurant which Gurd jieff was then using as his New York \"offic e.\" \"He had grown fat,\" Bragdon wrote, \"he looked untidy; time had turned his long, black ringmaster's m ous tache to grey; but he was unmist akably a personage, and the old, arroga nt, undaunted look shone forth from his eyes .\" Toomer's reaction to this mercurial Falst aff was confused. Perhaps what had appeared right and proper in the castle of the Great Magician seemed � and petty in the United States. At all events, when he met Gurdjieff in New York in the spring of 1933, he was disconcert ed. \"He was in a bad way. His health was poor. He looked it, however, looked as if he had been throqgh a mill .... \" Gurd jieff's behavior was as appalling as his physical condition. It was unprincipl ed, unpleasant, and absurd. Toomer fe lt \"a great relief when I left New York and thus left him. To me he seemed a changed man, changed for the wors e. I felt his work was dead. Whether dead or not there was no place or function for me in it. It was a travesty and hollow mockery of the work I had entered in 1924 with all my heart. I would have nothing to do with what was going on at present. I would have something to do with future work-if there was a fu ture work�n the critical basis as if I were meeting him and his work for the first time, taking nothing for granted .\" l During the summer of 1933, the scandalous rumors about Gurdjieff began to spread. Toomer recorded the speculations of some disillusioned disciples that Gurdjieff himself was out of control and smashing everyth ing. \"He seemed to be tearing down everyth ing he had created ,\" he wrote"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"422 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE disconsolately. \"His life seemed a blight, he was alienating people and throwing them off right and left .... \" Yet he refused to condem n. He still possessed a legacy which he treasured in the form of the ideas and Beelzebub's Tales . He could not pass judgment on the man who had given him these; but he could stand aside. The lieutenant resolved not to bring any new recruits to his tricky general. This resulted in an ironical state of affairs. Those whom Toomer himself had introduced to the ideas began to lecture their former teache r. \"I found myself in the role of a student to my own fo rmer pupils who had now risen above me,\" he commented wryly, \"because they saw and believed whereas 1 was blind and skeptical . The situation was not without its humo r.\" There was an obvious parallel to the dilemma which Gurdjieff had presented Orage two years earlier; and Toomer's resolution of the problem recalls the fate of his old friend and fo rmer teache r. Orage 's establishment as the father of a family had helped to loosen the ties which bound him to Gurdj ieff; and in early 1934, Toomer had moved to New York where he met Marjorie Content-one of the earliest partners in the Sunwise Turn-and the pair decided to marry. Toomer wrote to Gurd jieff requesting an interview. He explai ned that his \"center of gravity\" had first been in Gurd jieff's work, then in his first marria ge. After this, he wrote, he had gravitated back into the Work ; but now he proposed to marry again. He approached Gurdjieff in a valedictory mood, although he was still prepared to discover the old fascinati on. At their first meeting Gurdjieff told him that he was leaving for France the next day. Toomer knew that he was short of money and gave him 200 dolla rs. Gurdjieff imm ediately began to work on him for more. They met again in Gurd jieff's apartment. Toomer found the rooms piled high with the normal rubble of Gurdjieffian living; it was clear that their occupant had not the slightest intention of leaving America for many weeks to come. Gurd jieff put pressure on his visitor for a sum of over 300 dollars, giving his \"essence-word\" that he would be paid back in four months' time, and that he would have \"a place in his future creat ions.\" These tactics imm ediately reaw akened all Toomer's distaste of the previous spring, and the reasons which had driven him away again became compe lling. What could be in the man's mind? Who and what was he? What were his purp oses? What aims did he have for me, if any? What aims for the people of the world? Was 1 a mere tool? Was I not even that, so nothing fr om his point of view that he need not even consider the way he used or misused me? Was he the supreme egotist? Was he, as some claimed, insane? Did he, as some also claimed, know psychic laws 'but was essen tially stupid in his practical dealing with people? If he knew"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUN TAIN 423 anything at all about me, how could he fa il to know that I was ready and willing to do all I possibly could as regards any real need of his that I could grasp and understand, whereas just these tricky manipulative tactics were sure to throw me off. Or, on the other hand, was he, under the guise of this, to me, distasteful propos al, trying to do something fo r my good? The sickening fe eling of uncertainty allowed fo r no firm decision s. Perched on his fence, Toomer wavered now this way , now that. This is what is so awfu l about the situation with G. The situations themselves are always taxing-and you can arrive at no sure reconcilia­ tion or fixed understanding because for every fact there is a counter­ fact, fo r every reason a counter reason , fo r every bit of \"bad\" behavior another bit of \"good\" behavior, for every son-of -a-bitching thing a counter saintly thing. All of a sudden his resist ance colla psed. He felt that he hims elf was insign ificant-so why not give the money? The Gurdjieff he now saw was in improved health , full of vitality, altoge ther a return to his fo rmer self. Insane? He was in fu ll possession of every one of his extraordinary faculti es. Debauched and slovenly? Nothing of the sort. Afraid of the dark and being alon e? It was ridicul ous. Whate ver he had gone thro ugh, the thing that showed plainly was a decided improvement in every respect. Too mer admitted his bafHement over Gurd jieff's anti cs. He decided that some of the deceptions were so transparent that those who fell fo r them deserved no sympathy. \"Why does he work in this way?\" he asked. \"Mi ght as well ask the sphi nx. \" But the sphinx had become a little more commu nicativ e, and as the result of answers Gurdjieff gave to his pupils' questions, it began to be rumored that he would begin a new phase of work on his \"birthday ,\" January 13. He had ended a phase of writing and recuperation which had begun with his accide nt in 1924. After the accident, said Gurd jieff, he had been compelled to \"produce energy artificially .\" He announced expansively that he had consumed enough drink to fe ll ten men, and also forty pounds of opium. In order to restore his body, he said, he had been doing things which .would make him suffer when he remembered them. Too mer's comment was that this explanation said nothing about \"the benefits or distastes experienced by those others who were parties to his Gurdjieffian nights .\""},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"424 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE To Toom er, Gurd jieff became quite confidential, and the American plucked up courage to ask whether Gurdjieff remembered a time when he had promised to make him \"ruler of Afric a.\" Gurd jieff smiled: \"Something went wrong,\" he said. Toomer's psyche was African . At this Toomer was puzzled, remembering that at different times Gurd jieff had told him that he was both English and American. He quizzed the Master again. \"You not as I counted ,\" he said. \"How do you mean?\" \"In the very beginning I counted you.\" I suppose he meant, \"got my numb er.\" He went on, \"You not as I count ed.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"You manif est differently at different times, different from what I expect ed. You not as I counted and 1 get angry.\" \"Angry? Why?\" \"You not as I counted .\" Gurdjieff remained in New York until the late spring of 1934, and Toomer was approached for more money on at least one other occasion. But despite his renewed affection for the Master, he was not back in the foI l Like Orage before him, he had a sense that he was up against a brick wa ll. In 1935 he was married and detached from his roots in Chicago . He wrote : \"I have reached the limit of my possibilities fo r the present. 1 can do n o more fo r myself in the way of having new experiences. In the immediate future I, myse lf, personally , do not exist .\" In 1936 he and his wife moved to Doylesto wn, Pennsylvania, and fo r a time, all contact with Gurdjieff and his pupils ceased. It should be said, however, that late in life Toomer returned to the fold, and that his last years were spent working with a Gurd jieff group . By 1934 the Work in America was in a fragmented state. During the 1920s, it had seemed that the Master and his subordinates were determined to extend their activi ties at least among the fe w deemed capable of appreciati ng what they were up to: Now it began to seem that-since the break with Orag e-e verything that had been achieved had been sacrificed. In New York there was a divided group of perhaps fewer than thirty fo llowe rs. Toomer no longer superintended affairs �n Chicago, although a Chicago group continued to exist and Gurd jieff visited the town, trailing chaos in his wake , both in 1932-33 and in 1933-34. In various other Amer ican cities, there were small groups who remained interested in Gurd jieff' s ideas. But the most impressive result of his influence had appeared in the work of another man, Frank Lloyd Wright. The marriage of the distinguished architect to Olgivanna Hinzenberg in August 1928, resulted in a close J;.elationship between the Lloyd Wrights"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEA TH THE MOUNTAIN 425 and Gurdjieff . The couple had attended Toomer's Chicago groups, and Frank Lloyd Wright announced the foundation of his Taliesin Fellowship in 1932-the year in which Toomer left Chicago . The Fellowship was announced as teaching \"essent ial architectu re,\" and Gurdjieff was one of its first guests. Olgivanna Lloyd Wright's book, The Struggle Within, was not published until 1955, but the philosophy which it embodies, and which inspired the community from the start, derives quite obviously from Gurdjieff. \"Our survival ,\" she begins, \"lies in the destruction of the false self.\" And from this precept flows the fa miliar ideas of suffering, conscious effort, and self-knowledge which she had imbibed from her master. During the 1930s, Wright often accompanied his wife to Gurd jieff's table in New York or Paris, and Gurd jieff visited Taliesin several times. The relation ship of the two men was one of mutual respect tinged with suspicion; Wright did not willingly play second fiddle to anyone. Yet he cooperated loyally during the Master's last visits to the United States. During the Second World War, Taliesin provided a congenial refuge fo r the de Hartman ns, the Notts, and other followers of Gurdjieff who fled Europe in the face of Hitler. Taliesin is still run according to Gurdjieffian principle s. It was largely because she disagreed with these that Stalin's daughter Svetlana left the community after her flight to the United States. The situation foreshadowed what was to emerge after the deaths of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. The influence of the Work has often been most pervasive in the areas where it is least obvious-not in the groups or societies formed to perpetuate the ideas, but through more underground connecti ons. Gurd jieff had driven away the de Hartma nns, Orage , and most of his . other close pupils. In America he behaved so badly that he reduced some of his former supporters to supporting a prosecution. And Ouspensky's pupils agreed that it was at about this time that their teacher ceased to keep a weather eye on Gurdjieff. No one knew what Gurdjieff intended. Toomer was far from alone in his perplexity over the Master's future plans. Rom Landau tried to find out something in 1934 and was unsuccessful. He was told by a pupil of Gurd jieff's that many of his followers had been waiting for years for answers to such question s. No one was even sure what had happ ened already . Gurd jieff was as solated as a tight-rope walker who has ceased to believe in the tight-rope vhich supports him. fhe view from Europe provides no simple answers. The main problems are posed by the sale of the Prieure and the publication of Herald of Coming Good . The sale of the Prieure was a curious affair. It does not seem that"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"426 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE mortgages were the primary cause, although Gurd jieff's long-term financial obligat ions were probably irredeema ble. The immed iate reason for the sale was a bill from the local coal mercha nt: Gurd jieff owed 200 or 300 francs. He had managed to avoid paying much greater bills and could no doubt have sidestepped this one. But it seemed that he had ceased to care: the bill remained unpaid, and the debt was bought by a Paris banker, who foreclo sed. The Prieu re-with all its contents, including the fu rniture which had come with the original purchase from Mme. Laborie-was sold. Gurd jieff appeared to have lost interest in his chateau . His apathy was so complete that his followers had to rescue trunks filled with musical manuscripts from under the noses of the auctioneers. Had he really been planning \"work on a big scale\" for the next year as Alexandre de Salzmann had told Nott? Had the Prieure served its purpose and become a millstone round his neck? Or was the episode the result of that decline in Gurd jieff's energies which was so noticeable to his American supporters? Nott was as depressed as Gurd jieff's American followers with the Master's physical condition. He found him irrita ble, silent, and morose. But as alwa ys, there are contradicti ons. It seems from Nott's account that Gurd jieff was quite aware he was ruining his health by eating too much fat, and he even had unflattering photographs taken which he stuck on packet � of sweets and gave away . This supports the idea that, for reasons of his own, Gurd jieff had decided to place himself in as bad a light as possible, and at the same time, to make a clean break with the past phases of his activity. But if we accept that he had deliberately allowed the Prieure to slip from his grasp, we must explain away the fact that in 1934, the year after the sale, Gurd jieff was angling for a permanent base in America. He remembered Mabel Dodge Luhan's offer of 1926 and delegated Toomer to see whether her house in Taos was still available . On August 18, 1934, Toomer had to report that the chatelai ne of Taos now showed no noticeable enthusiasm for the project. During the mid-19 30s, Gurdjieff made at least one other attempt to tap the bank balance of a rich woman in order to reestablish himself in a large house. Did he regard the loss of the Prieure in a serious light, or was this simply a stratagem to raise money? This question is crucial to the interpretation of that eccentric work, Herald of Coming Good . This first published writing of Gurd jieff is dated from the Cafe de la Paix on January 13, 1933. It is subtitled, \"First Appeal to Contemporary Humanit y,\" and was priced at \"from 8 to 108 French francs.\" The \"good\" which Gurd jieff announced to the world was the coming publication of the books on which he had been engaged over the past seven years, principally the (now completed) \"First Series\" known as Beelzebub's Tales, of which Herald of Coming Good included a synopsis. Appended to it were s.even fo rms of registration on which the purchaser was supposed to write. his"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUN TAIN 427 name and address, how he had acqu ired the book, the particulars of whoever had recommended it to him, and the price he had elected to pay. The object of all this rigamarole was to give Gurdjieff some idea of the size of the audience he could expect for Beelzebub's Tales and to make sure he would reach the people who had already responded to his ideas. Unfor­ tunately, there is no doubt that Herald of Coming Good was one of the factors which subst antially reduced his prospective reade rship. The style and the presentation were intimidating. The prose was, if anything, more rambling and less consequen tial than that of Beelzebub's Tales . Gurd jieff now had no Orage to structure his sentences for him, and an uninitiated reader like Rom Landau might well be forgiven for thinking that at best he had stumbled on the folly of a peculiar monomaniac. The little book was put together in haste, and its author had second, third, and fourth thoug hts. A substa ntial section merely reproduces the English translation of the prospectus fo r the Institute fo r the Harmonious Develop­ ment of Man. As well as the body of the text, there are two prefatory notes, a printed \"circular lette r,\" added after the book had gone to press, and a \"supplement ary announcement\" tacked to the end. The opening section of Herald of Coming Good contains the first information about himself which Gurdjieff made public. If the reader avoided becoming trapped in the oxbow lakes sometimes fo rmed by Gurd jieff's sentences, he would have discovered a sketchy narrative of the author's search for knowledge in the East and his career as a professional hypnot ist. This last piece of information caused great consternation when it became known among his followers; and it has of ten been insinuated that copies of Herald of Coming Good are rare as a result of a campaign to suppress this damaging evidence. Even more shocking to Gurd jieff's pupils was the admission that he regarded them as experimental anima ls. He stated bluntly that he had founded his Institute \"for purely personal ends\" and roundly abused the people who had supported him after his \"accid ent.\" Coming in the midst of Gurd jieff's appare ntly most unscrupulous behavi or, Herald of Coming Good seemed to confirm the worst suspicions of his disillusioned followers, and its appearance in the spring of 1933 coincided with the biggest exodus of his American pupi ls. But if Gurd jieff were really the unprincipled cynic he seemed to be, why did he suddenly confess everything? It could be that he had tired of the game, that he proposed to let the illusion of his master dissolve altogethe r. It could also be that this was a deliberate shock gauged to \"test\" his follow ers. Or, may it have been simple misjudgment? It is clear that at the time of his writing of Herald of Coming Good, Gurdjieff anticipated continued contact with his discip les. Apart from announcing the publication of Beelzebub's Tales, he provided an explana-"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"428 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE tion of his idiosyncratic behavior -the story that fo r the past twenty-one years he had been living an artificial life in order to prevent his guinea pigs fr om idolizing him. \"Be lieve me, \" he writes, \"during the whole period of my relations with you, my inner world never harboured either egotistical or altruistic impul se s.\" He also announced plans fo r the continuation of his work; but as fo r any perceptible effect on his fo llowe rs, these might as well have remained unvoic ed. Aside fr om the details of the plans, there were one or two indications that Gurd jieff himself did not share the exaggerated view of his abilities held by some of his pupil s. He admitted to possessing \"wea knesses\" and ref erred to \"undes irable manif estations of my nature .\" He also explained some of the principles of teach ing and role playing upon which he claimed to have based his recent conduct. Gurdjieff talks of a principle which he expre sses in a single hyphenated sen­ tence: ''To-be-patient- towa rds-every-being -and-not-to-atte mpt-by-the -pos si­ bilities-in-our -power-to -alter-the -consequences -of-t he-evil-deeds-of -our-neigh­ hours .\" DUring the previous fo ur months, he write s, he has tried to put this principle into practice himself and encouraged others to do the same . He chose three pupils fo r this exper iment. One he influenced \"by means of al most uninterrupted, kindly-intentioned persuasions and conscientious exhortati ons ,\" the second \"by threats of the terrible future aw aiting him,\" and the third \"by means of various hypnotic suggestion s.\" During the same period, while maintaining his \"inner benevole nce\" to the best of his ability, Gurd jieff write s that he set himself the task of quarre ling \"rut hlessly\" with all actions inspired by people's vanity , but always \" under a mask of s�rious irritati on.\" Whether the three subjects he describes ever existed is questiona ble, fo r Herald of Coming Good is no freer from preposterous and unverifiable statements than any other of Gurd jieff's wri tings. But the three diff erent tec hniques of manipulation are those Gurd jieff consistently employed: fo r one man the carro t, for another the stick, fo r a third hidden persuasion. Any of Gurd jieH\" s pupils might have fo und in Herald of Coming Good the keys to a dozen puzzling experience s. If they had chosen to look, that is. For most of them did not. It is fr ightening to think that one has wasted a great deal of time entirely under the influence of a skillf ul puppet master and much more consoling to believe that one has been the dupe of the devil, or is immersed in a cosmic mystery of unf athomable propor tions. The most significant fa ct about Herald of Coming Good is that it was ignored or rejected. Two atti tudes were common: either Gurd jieff was seen as a phony of the most obnoxious sort or he was taken at fa ce value, his every claim acce pted. Whether he was thought to be a hero or a villain, the result fo r his fo llowers was the same: oversimplif icati on, stupef acti on, and-as he would have said­ \"sleep .\" Gurd jieff had given away his secret; and perhaps the reaction made him"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNT AIN 429 decide that his disclosures had been premature. In New York in 1934, only a year after publicat ion, he was at work on an \"Introduction\" designed to replace the Herald and was recalling all unsold copies. Originally, he spent a lot of money on the production and hoped to market the book commercially, but later he simply gave it away . Nott and Elizabeth Gordon sent copies to all Ouspensky's pupils, and Ouspensky had it read to a gathering of his closest circle. The general opinion was that the tract was \"almost paranoia c,\" and Ouspensky suggested that perhaps Gurdjieff had syph ilis. All copies of Herald of Coming Good in England were rounded up and destroyed. There is a widely believed story that Gurdj ieff intended Herald of Coming Good to shock Ouspensky. This does not seem to go far enough. The booklet would have served as a \"shoc k,\" not only to Ouspensky, but to other close followers whose dependence on him Gurdjieff had not been able to cure. By revealing his secrets Gurdjieff might have expected to encourage a proper comprehension of his ideas in those who were able to understand him-and to disemba rrass himself of followers whose credulity passed all bounds. Of course, it might have been a quite straigh tforward appeal. The \"Supplement ary Announcement\" gives some support to this theory. It is dated March 7, 1933, from the Grand Cafe, Fontainebleau. Gurd jieff writes that this postscript is \"evoked\" by \"the events of an economic, political and social character taking place in the past few weeks .\" At first sight this seems to mean that the economic and political crisis -wh ich, for example, brought Hitler to power in Germ any-had resulted in Gurd jieff's addr essing an appeal to former members of the Institute. He announces that from June first, he proposes to reestablish the activities of the Institute as they had existed before his \"accid ent\" and to resume the life he had led before deciding to concentrate on writing. But it may be wondered whether Gurd jieff's notion of \"economic and political crises\" extended further than the coal bill and the mortgages on the Prieure, and whether this last section of his odd pamphlet is not a simple appeal for money to save the chateau. And of course Herald of Coming Good might have been simply a jeu a esprit . Gurd jieff announced a new and improved Study House which he claimed was to be erected that April . It was to be equipped with the most splendid devices. There were to be three laborato ries dealing with branches of science previously unknown on earth ; \"namely the 'magnetic­ Astra l,' the 'Thoughthanbledz oin,' and the 'Ment aloethero-winge d.'\" Two inventions of Gu rdjieff were to be set up in the new building: the \"Luminous Keyboard\" anli the \"Retro-rebounding-Echoraising Organ .\" It is impossible to believe that Gurd jieff himself took these impressively titled inventions seriously, or that he expected others to do so. But, was there l!"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"430 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCL E purpose in these absurditie s? If Gurd jieff had Beelzebub's Tales read aloud to his pupils and the meaning was too readily understood, he would alter the offending passage in the book, lengthen his already endless sentenc es, and conceal entirely the already obscure symbolism. \"Mu st dig dog deeper ,\" he would say; and his pupils would have to scrabble for the bone. Gurd jieff's literary work and his personal teaching were very similar. He would help a pupil toward a valuable insight, and then try to confuse the issue by talking nonsense for hours on end. In Herald of Coming Good he revealed some of his trade secrets-and then buried the bone under some obViously fraudulent claims about his invention of the \"Luminous Key­ board.\" Whether or not Herald of Coming Good had any significance for Gurd jieff's plans for the immediate future, it could not prevent the loss of the Prieure. Gurdjieff retired to Paris, where he lived for a time in the Grand Hotel. The sale of the Prieure and his trip to Ame rica in 1933-34 mark the end of a period of turmo il which had begun in 1929. About the year 1930, Gurdjieff wrote a piece of music called \"As if the difficult years had pa ssed.\" Whether in his own estimation the difficult years were already over or were still to come, the 1930s were trying enough. The decade took permanently some of his closest companio ns. Memento morl ... people had begun to die. Alexandre de Salzmann died in 1933, Orage in 1934; and during the later 1930s, Gurd jieff's brother Dmitri and Leonid Stoerneval also died. Gurd jieff's personal circumstances were less favorable than at any time since his arrival in the West, and he seemed to have exhausted the energy which usually enabled him to rise above misfortune. , After the sale of the Prieure he was more than ever dependent on his remaining American pupi ls. From midsummer 1933 until midsummer 1935, he spent most of his time in the United States. For six mont hs he stayed with Fred Leighton-a wealthy adherent whose allegiance dated back to the Oragean groups of the mid-19 20s-and made several efforts to reestablish himself in the style to which he had become accustomed during his occupancy of the Prieure. It was during this period that Toomer approached Mabel Luhan on his behalf and, according to J. G. Bennett, a number of other attempts were made to find support for his plans. One project foundered when the plane carryi ng a senator on his way to meet Gurd jieff exploded in midair. Another was prevented by the refusal of the Soviet authoritie s to allow Gurdjieff to teach his System in the USSR. He sailed for Europe some time in the summer of 1935, appa rently in a despondent state of mind; after a visit to Germany, he returned to Paris. Bennett believed that between May and July 1935, Gurdjieff succee ded"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNT AIN 431 in returning to Central Asia. He produces no evidence to support this assertion , beyond his own recollection that toward the end of his life, Gurd jieff spoke of a trip he had made to Persia-wh ich Bennett somehow associated with this stage in his career. But we know fo r certain only that he returned to Europe after his plans had apparently been frustrated at every turn. In the late summer of 1935, Gurd jieff reappeared in Paris. For a time he lived in a flat in the Rue Marchan d, then in one in the Rue Labis. In 1936 he moved to his best-known addre ss at 6, Rue des Colonels Renard , in what was then the Russian quarter just north of the Etoile. He was more elusive than before, and trave led widely: to Vichy, where there lived a number of Russians who had fo rmerly been at the Prieure; to the hotels on the Riviera where he seemed to feel at home; to Normandy to visit the Stoerneva ls; also to Germany and the Low Countr ies. He kept in touch with the small number of followers left in New York and a few old pupils in England like C. S. Nott, who occasionally visited him in Paris. Elizabeth Gordon from the Prieure remained with him; and a number of America ns, inspired by the teaching of Jane Heap, took the Master by storm. The Gurdjieff whom they knew was a man more obviously benevolent than his younger self. It was as if, having buried his bone hundreds of meters deep to confuse history, he allowed his followers closer to the larder than they had been fo r a deca de. The final number of The Little Review had symbolized a complete break with its editors' previous lives. It was a confession offaith in the Work; and, once committed Jane Heap in particular devoted the whole of her powerful energies to the cause. She became the intermediary between Gurd jieff and . . the expatriate commu nity of. Paris, and from as early as 1927, she supervised an \"artist's group .\" In many ways she took over the function of Orage as the missi onary to the intellectua ls; and she came to occupy a place in the affections of her pupils not far removed from the niche reserved fo r her initiator . Margaret Anderson ranks her with Orage as the best \"introducer\" to the System, and it was largely Jane Heap's doing that Gurd jieff's \"reputation loomed in Left Bank conversations\" (to quote his follower Kathryn Hulme) \"in a persistent hush-hush way, like a cloud enveloping a Jehova h.\" From 1932 Jane Heap's group began to meet in a more regular fashion in her apart ment in Montparnasse. It included Solita Solano and also Georgette Leblanc and Margaret Anderson, when they visited Paris . In The Unknowable Gu�djieff Margaret Anderson prints a series of aphorisms made by Jane Heap in her exposition of the Work, and these remain the only published records of her teach ing.

The size of Jane Heap's group and the names of others who comprised it remains a mystery. Janet Flanner -a uthor of the \"Genet\" columns for the New Yorker and translator of Georgette Lebla nc's Maeterlinck and I-an d Djuna Barnes-the author of Nightwood-were friends of The Little Review circ le, and may possibly have been among her group . For just as the Prieure had been part of \"Paris in the Twenties\" first Jane Heap, and then Gurd jieff him self, were part of \"Paris in the Thirt ies\": a Paris where the wine tasted a little sourer than in the previous decade ; the . Paris of Nightwood, which T. S. Eliot published in 1936, with an introduction hinting that the perversions of the novel's characters stood only fo r the wider situat ion. Jane Heap -w hose \"personal magnetism was almost visible\" -pr ovided a sheet anchor fo r a number of displaced persons. In late October 1936, she left Paris fo r London on Gurd jieff's orders to begin teaching there. Her Paris group was left, as Kathryn Hulme writ es, \"high and dry\"; she had always discour aged them fr om meeting Gurdjieff personally , on the grounds that his role playing would put them off the Work . But three or fo ur of her stranded pupils, including Solano and Hulme herse lf, refused to be daunt ed, and bearded the Master in the Cafe de la Paix. Gradually, with the addition of Elizabeth Gord on, and later Margaret Anderson and Georgette Leblanc, this circle became a regular group under fo rmal instruction from Gurdjieff. It was a group which Gurd jieff kept strictly to itsel f, a group composed of women of a certain type--l iterary, sophisti­ cated, and single--w hether divorc ed, deserted, unmarried, or fr ankly Lesbian . Casual visitors who asked to be allowed to join the Work were met with a blank refusal . Kathryn Hulme in Undiscovered Country and Margaret Anderson in The Fiery Fountains have both described the Gurd jieff of 1936-38 . The Master who emerges is essent ially a kind and charitable man. He could be terrib le: raging at his pupils fo r some fault real or imaginary; exacting; giving them strenuous exercises fo r the development of their \"inner worl ds\"; or contradictory in fam iliar fa shion. But an atmosphere of mellow ness sur­ rounds him-as if the difficult years had indeed l>assed. He was no longer the grasping entrepr eneur, but the charitable man, consoling the lonely women for what was lacking in their lives; no long e r the ogre, but the man known as \"Monsieur Bonbon\" fr om his habit of giving away sweets to shop assistants, lift boys, and casual passersby. His hospitality was as extravagant as ever, his charity overstepped the bounds of his pupils and fri ends, and gradually the walls of his Hat began to fill with oil paintings of all �o rts-"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN 433 most of them excrucia tingly bad- which he bought in order to keep the artists alive . Until the end of his life, the traffic of pupils and patients in and out of his apartm ent was swollen by those to whom he referred as \"mes parasites. \" If he was more genial, he was also more straightf orward than before. It may be that the records of this period are written by people who were in particularly close contact with him, but the Gurd jieff of their accounts is less confusing and more paternal : he gave direct instructions for performing exercise s-for example, with rosaries such as the ones \"Ushe Narzunoff\" is holding in his photogra ph; he was concerned less with the intricacies of cosmolo gy-h e had abandoned his writing for good-and more with practical instruction. There were still the familiar, enormous, and taxing lunches with the traditional idiot toasts. The same extraordinary ability to assess psychological states was brought into play as Gurdjieff christened his pupils with animal names, names which he said expre ssed their \"inner natur es.\" Once more the hair-ra ising motor expeditions set off for Vichy or the South Coast-where in Monte Carlo Gurdjieff gave all his \"children\" money and sent them off to play at the Casino. In the Rue des Colonels Renard , his eccentric scheme of decora tion, his Oriental cooking, and his perpetually shuttered windows plucked his pupils from the heart of Paris into another world. At about the same time that Jane Heap's group of Americans began to meet regularly in her apartm ent in Mont parnas se, the Work at long last began to penetrate the Parisian intelligentsia. This was the responsibility of Alexandre and Jeanne de Salzman n. The group which Alexandre de Salzmann gathered round him in 1932 • was the second which he and his \",ife brought to Gurdjieff. About 1928 the de Salzmanns visited Alphons Paquet in Frankf urt, and together with Louisa Goepf ert, they began group readings from Beelzebub's Tales in the Paquet household. Paquet himself visited Gurd jieff only once, shortly before the closure of the Prieure; but in the autumn of 1932, his wife and one of his daughters came to Paris to study with the Master. In his turn, Gurd jieff visited Germany on sever al occasions. Paqu et's daughter, Frau Henr iette Klingmiiller, remembers his first appearance in Frankf urt, when all her sisters were tipped by Gurd jieff-b ut she herself left out. \"You not necessa rily mone y,\" remarked the Master, \"you my godchild\"; and proceeded to concern himself especially with his goddaugh­ ter whose dowry he appa rently withheld. Apart from the' Frankfurt group, de Salzmann's services were rendered chiefly at the Prieure.

The group which collected round him in the two years before his death in 1933 arrived largely by accide nt. The literary-philosophical group known as the Grand Jeu originated in the fr iendship of fo ur Rheims schoolb oys, Rene Daumal, Roger-Gilbert Lecomte, Roger Vailland, and Robert Meyrat. All except Daum al-t he youngest by a year-were born in 1907. They became bored and world­ weary at a precociously early age . They called themselves the \"Phreres simplist es,\" cultivated a morbid sense of humor, and experimented with alcohol and the occult. By 1927 the group were living in Paris and had made contact with kindred spirits. The enlarged circle decided to publish a review. This was called 1£ Grand leu -but significantly , it had originally been entitled La Voie . \"We believe in all miracle s,\" procl aimed the manif esto. \"Attitude : one must enter into a state of complete receptivity, be pure in order to do this, having created a void within oneself. From this stems our ideal wish to place everything in question at every moment . . . . We do not accept because we no longer u nderstand anythi ng.\" The signatories of the manif esto sought the \"eternal moments\" which nourished the spirit. \"It is in such moments that we absorb everything, that we swallow God so as to become transparent enough to disappear .\" By the end of 1930, the Grand Jeu was in a state of decay . Vailland and Lecomte were continually in and out of the hospital ; the Surrealists had finally withdrawn the hand of fri endship; and there was a conflict between a left-wing political element and the esotericists within the group. Daumal himself was living in poverty, drifting fro m place to place , beginning to lose his teeth , and taking to his bed. He later admitted that he was \"close to madness and death .\" At this critical point, he was introduced to Alexan der de Salzmann. The intermediary was the Czech artist Josef Sima, who was one of the signatories to the Grand leu manif esto. One evening, after a meeting of the Grand Jeu at Sima's, the group encountered de Salzmann in his usual cafe on the Boulevard St. Germain. The artist always sat alone, smoking from a long cigarette holder, drinking a mixture of calvados and beer -of which he would consume perhaps a dozen glasses each eveXling. His hands would be occupied with a pencil-co ntinuously designing what looked like Oriental calligraphy. Daumal was bowled over, and de Salzmann came to seem-in the words of the poet's biograph er, Michel Random-\"the man who could save everything .\" De Salzmann's puckish sense of humor evidently influenced his relatio nship with the younger man-and Daumal wrote enthusias tically that the artist was \"a fo rmer dervish, fo rmer Bened4:tine, fo rmer prof essor of jiu-jitsu, healer, stage -designer, not a tooth left in his"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUN TAIN 435 head, an incredible man.\" \"We no longer understand anyth ing,\" the Grand leu manif esto had declar ed. In contras t, for Daumal, de Salzmann was the Man Who Knows. Other members of the Grand Jeu were less sure of the Russian's omniscience, and Daumal reproached a friend for his lack of percepti on; \"You still have only the reflection of a shadow of a vague feeling of the Personage he is . I look forward (wrongly) to witnessing the moment at which you realise this. But it is certain that you will find him on your way­ as if by chance-the very day on which you need him .... \" The advent of de Salzmann hastened the breakup of the Grand Jeu. This finally came about at the beginning of 1932, when the political and mystical wings of the group clashed over the question of militar ism. By this time, Rene Daumal was living with Vera Milanova, the young Russian whom he subsequently married; together the couple spent entire nights discussing the Work with de Salzmann. In 1932 Vera traveled to the United States and Daumal took a job as a press agent to the Indian dancer Uday Shankar in order to tour America with his troupe. In New York he composed La Grande Beuverie (\"The Great Drunk\") as his farewell to the complicated literary and occult world of the Grand Jeu. It comprises a denunciation of the ordinary apparatus of communication; a description of the \"artificial parad ises\" created by those who see through such illusions; and a recommen dation of a superior world of reality. This is the world of the awakened man of the Work, and it is not to be gained without a struggle. The agent of this struggle is the Master Totochabo-perhaps de Salzmann, perhaps what Daumal had heard of Gurdjieff from de Salzma nn-who appears with the familiar message: \"There is a way out.\" In 1933 Alexander de Salzmann died of tuberc ulosis. The Prieure had not yet been sold, but he was living in a hotel in Fontainebleau . He was quite alone, and Gurdjieff refused to visit him. One of the inmates of the Prieure used to call on him in the evenings with presen ts-halva and other delicacies-s muggled out from Gurd jieff's table. De Salzmann lay in a darke ned room, his skin a bluish-gray. He was clearly dying, but still Gurd jieff would not come to see him. Event ually, the sick man summoned up the strength to rise from his bed and sought out Gurdjieff in the Cafe Henri IV. The pupil who had brought him halva was sitting at the next table , and it seemed to her that Gurd jieff was \"not very kind\" to the man who had made such an effort to see him. A few days after the interview, de Salzmann died. It is said- but also vehement ly denied-that his last words were: 'Tll know on the other side whether he's a Master or a demon .\" Gurd jieff's appare nt cruelty may have conveyed something to de Salzmann which is closed' to outsiders, but to an outsider it cannot seem that he acted in a particularly admirable fa shion. What passed between the two mEm is unknown; but the incident must remain one of the blacke st"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"436 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE marks against the Gurd jieff of \"the difficult years .\" Neither is it known what effect the death of the Man Who Knows had on Rene and Vera Daumal; fo r by 1933, their loyalty had passed beyond devotion to a man and become devotion to a teaching. On their return to France from the Unite d States, they settled down in Paris, where Daumal worked on the Encyclopedie FranQaise and achieved some fame in 1936 with the publication of his volume of poetry, Le Contre­ Ciel . In 1935 they visited Geneva to work with Mme. de Salzma nn, acco mpanied by the Orientalist Philippe Lavas tine--at that time a pub­ lisher and the first French recruit to the Work from outside Daumal's imm ediate circle . But from 1934 until the outbreak ' of the war, the headquarters of the new group which fo rmed around Mme. de Salzmann was in Sevres. The house at Sevres, writes Jean Bies, \"reproduced in miniature the Prieure of Avon .\" The building stood in the middle of a derelict park and contained a large room fo r the movements and semi- permanent quarters fo r Mme. de Salzma nn, Dauma l, and Lavas tine. Every evening the Daumals would travel out from Paris to take part in movements classe s-which lasted fa r into the night, like Gurd jieff's at the Prieure. There were readings from the chapters of Beelzebub's Tales which had been translated into French; there was housework ; and on weekends the house filled with visitors. Acc ording to Bies, the group began to disintegrate about 1937, although it did not finally break up until two years later . . When the Sevres group had been established fo r some time, Gurd jieff reappeared in Paris, and Mme. de Salzmann began to bring her pupils to him. Gurdjieff sat-a Caucasian minota ur-at the center of a labyrinth of initiation s. Pupils approached him through \"exoteric ,\" \"mesoteric ,\" and \"esoteric\" groups . The favored, like Daumal and Lavas tine, were some­ times invited to meals at the flat in the Rue des Colonels Renard . By the outbreak of war the pattern of future activities had become established: a pupil would be introduced to the Work by Mme. de Salzmann, and only after some months-or even years-might be selected to meet the Master hims elf. It was an external fo rm fo r an idea which animated each pupil, however he or she expre ssed it: that gradually they were penetrating to the center of the secrets of the universe. Later, Daumal constructed an allegory of this spiritual progre ss in his most famous work, Mount Analogue, which he did· not live to complete. Mount Analogue is described as \"a novel of symbolically non-Euclidean adventures in mountain climbin g,\" and in its allegorical and elliptical style, there are frequent trace s of Daumal the 'pataph ysician. The book is dedicated to Alexander de Salzmann, who may be portrayed under, the name of Pierre Sogol (Sogol = Logos), a \"Prof essor of Mountaineering.Ai In"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"THE BONE BENEATH THE MOUNTAIN 437 the story, Sogol assembles a band of would-be mountaineer s to climb Mount Analogue , which stands on an island hidden from obser vation by the curvature of space . \"Everything takes place as if Mount Analogue did not exis t.\" In order to reach the island \"one must assume the poss ibility and even the necessity of reaching it.\" The 'pata physics with which Sogol \"reasons\" himself and his team on to the island are expertly deplo yed; and the characters of the vario us mountaineers are described in the same traditi on. The rewards of cli mbing Mount Analogue are repr esented in \"perada ms,\" precious and almost invisible pieces of crystal . Clearly they are spiritual reward s, and fo r that reason indefinable--except in allegorical terms. But what if Daumal had all along been deluding himself? What if there were no peradam s-no bone beneath the mountain at all? If Sogol does repre sent de Salzmann, and not some more abstract figure-say a composite of Gurd jieff and de Salzmann, or simply an archetype of the Work teacher-the beginning of Mount Analogue provides some interesting indications of how the painter might have become estranged from Gurdjieff. Sogol tells his prospective pupil that he had yearned fo r \"som ething more\" in life and that at one stage he thought that he had fo und this in religi on. He \"entered a monastery ; a very strange one ... it belonged to a distinctly heretical order .\" Every day one of the brothers was select ed-unknown to the others-to play the role of the Tempter. \"One thing proves to me, \" Sogol says, \"the diabolica l nature of this custom: not one of the brothers ever refused to accept the role of Tempt er. . . . The Tempter was himself the victim of a monstrous temptati on.\" Sogol is persuaded by a Tempter to design machines fo r waking people up; but when he himself becomes Tempter, he realizes the child ishness of his inventions and the ignominy of his role in the monastery . He goes to the Superior and tells him that he can no longer play the devil: \"He spoke to me with mild severity, perhaps sincere, perhaps prof essional. 'My son,' he conclud ed, 'I see that there is in you an incurable need to under stand, which must prevent you from remaining any longer in this house. We shall pray God to call you to him by other paths .''' Might this not, in the language of Mount Analogue, be Daumal's record of how de Salzmann parted from Gurd jieff? If so it does not seem that the artist's diff erence of opinion with his Master was over much more than methods. But if the quarrel was a more serious affair, it is ironic that it was through de Salzmann, and afterward through his wife, that Gurdjieff was left with any pupils at all. Gurd jieff -at least in the opinion of one person who knew him well dUring the late 1920s and early 1930s-was growing old and tired; and he certainly had little inclination to proselytize fo r himsel f.

Accord ing to Nott, Gurd jieff had made plans to visit Lyne Place , in an atte mpt to cure Mme. Ouspensky of her illness. But the outbreak of hostilities prevented all contact with his fo llowers abroad. On the other hand, the disastrous course of the fighting in France helped to turn the minds of French intellectuals to things of the spirit.

Auden, and Christopher Isher wood­ made emig ration fa shionable around 1938, Ouspensky resisted the persua­ sion of his supporters to follow suit. You could be too clever, he said, in anticipating political events. He had in any case his own theory of what might happen. If England and France declared war on Soviet Russia, who by the Pact of Steel had revealed herself as Germany's ally, everything would be over within a year.

So it was that, just as the effects of Ouspensky's decision to expand began to make themselves felt in increased interest in his teachi ng, events conspired to prevent any real exploitation of these gains. Insecurity created a situation very like the early days of Ouspensky's own contact with Gurdjieff , and gradually even the questions at his meetings became devoted to the problems of war. Could war be stopped? he was asked. Ouspensky repeated what he had been told by Gurdjieff in 1915. Man can do nothing. Everything happens . To people who were convinced that the war was a simple case of right and wrong, he answered that there was no question of this, but that they had seen only a fraction of the truth. Hitler was the necessary outcome of the failure of the West to stop Bolshevism in Russia. Both Fascism and Communism were \"criminal\" partie s. He recalled how, when he had returned to St. Petersburg on the outbreak of the First World War, everyone had been concerned with what they would do when the fighting ended. But an end to hostilities had not meant that the war was over. Gradua lly, his bitter anger against the Bolsheviks developed into a pessimism which saw Europe being engulf ed by \"criminal elemen ts,\" even if the Allies should win. His ideas seemed, if anything, to have hardened since 1919, and doubtless the memory of past hardships rose to the surface of his mind. Bolshevism had always existed everywhere in different forms, he procla imed, sweeping Herriot, Daladier, Blum, H. G. Wells, Bernard Shaw, and the Labo ur Party into one cosmic incinerato r. He defined Bolshevism as essen tially a will to use violent methods to compel other people to accept one's ideas. Ouspensky's abhorrence of violence and his fear of a society dominated by \"criminals\" and Sudras combined with the disruptive effects of the war to force him inexorably toward America. On January 4, 1941, Mme. Ouspensky left for the United States. J. G. Bennett's wife was one of the farewell party at the station, and returned depressed by the total dependence exhibited by \"Madam's people\" on their teache r. Then on January twenty-fifth, Ouspensky announced his own depart ure. He told his assembled pupils that he could do nothing more in England; the outbreak of war had finally put an eild to the possibilities of continuing. He compared conditions to those he had experienced in the Caucas us. Quite possibly they were witnessing the end of one particular historical period and the beginning of anothe r. Although they must have expected it, the announcement hit his followers like a physical blow. The record of the farewell meeting shows how hard they found it to accept the idea of taking any individual initiati ve.

He would keep in contact by letter and might send them some material to read. If they wanted to engage in any personal work, he advised them to try \"stopping though ts.\" It was little help to the lost sheep he was leaving behind. Mme. Ouspensky had equipped Lyne Place so that when the war broke out as many families as possible could be evacuated from central Lond on; and under the direction of a couple who had joined Ouspensky in 1924, a small community assembled to wait out the war. At much the same time, Maurice Nicoll's fo llowers were evacuated to Gloucestershire from their farm in Essex. In London, J. G. Bennett and Kenneth Walker continued to hold small groups to discuss the System . But to all intents and purposes­ and with the exception of the Nicoll household in Gloucestershi re-the departure of the Ouspenskys left a vacuum in England. Some of Ouspensky's followers began maneuvering for jobs which would allow them to follow their teacher to America. Ouspensky's directorate was split between the emigrants and those who stayed at home. Besides Walke r, Bennett, and the couple who had taken charge of Lyne, the home guard included Dr. Francis Role s. The disciples who succeeded in finding jobs in America included Lord Pentland, the journalist who sometimes deputized for Ouspensky, and a comparatively new recruit to the circle at Lyne Place named Rodney Collin-Smith, better known under his pen name of Rodney Collin. Rodney Collin was born in Brighton in 1909, the eldest son of a retired wine importer. During childhood he became an omnivorous reader. At the age of eighteen, he spent several months walking in Andalusia and gathered the material for a book of travel sketches published in 1931 under the title of Palms and Patios . During the three years he spent at the London School of Economics, he began to write fo r newspa pers, and when he graduat ed, he became a freelance writer. He founded The Rucksa ck, the journal of the Youth Hostels Association of which he was secretary, and worked fo r the Toc H Journ al. On a pilgrimage organized by Toc H in 1930 to attend the Passion Play at Oberammergau, he met his future wife, Janet Buckley, who was eight years older than he . . Although they did not marry until 1934, this meeting seems to have marked an alteration in Rodney Collin-Smith's interests. All his loves seem to have been idealistic; his involvement with Toc H and the You th Hostels movement gave place to a devotion to the Peace Pledge Union and its Peace News; and in 1932 he contributed an article to The Aryan Path appea ling in a very Ouspen skian fashion fo r a sane world government by a spiritual aristocracy . This probably means that he had come in touch with the Theosophical wing of the Peace Pledge Union-of which J. D.

U. who introduced the Collin-Smiths to Ouspensky's lectures in the autumn of 1936. The previous year they had attended several lectures given by Maurice Nicoll, which had not roused in them any particular enthusia sm. But from the time of their meeting with Ouspensky, both husband and wife devoted themselves entirely to the Work. They bought a house at Virginia Water in order to be close to Lyne Place . Janet Collin-Smit h worked in the house, and her husband returned to work in the gard ens at Lyne during the evenings. He spent his spare time in the British Museum studying the history of psychological systems on the lines worked out in the program of the Historico-Psy chological SOciety. At Lyne he developed a taste for \"super -effort\" in Gurdjieff's sense; and this was to color his later application of the ideas which he learned from Ouspensky. \"Rodney had a leaning towards effort, struggle and self-diScipl ine,\" writes his sister-in-law, the novelist Joyce Coll in-Smith. \"He was by nature a school man and he took to the Fourth Way teach ing with enthusiasm .... \" When the war cam e, his wife traveled with Mme. Ouspensky to the United States. At first the group took a series of temporary houses in New York, and fo r a time based themselves at Rumson on the New Jersey coast. Then, with the help of Schuyler Jackson and other fo rmer Orageans who had already scoured New Jersey to find a refuge fo r Gur djieff, a substitute fo r Lyne was found. Event ually Franklin Farm s at Mendham-a fo rmer residence of the Governor of New Jers ey-was bought, largely out of money prOVided by Janet Collin -Smith. Her husband secured a job on the British Purch asing Commission, which sent him to Bermuda and Mexico before finally producing, about 1942-45, the hoped -for transfer to New York . Collin joined his wife and the daughter who had been born in 1937 at Mendham and began again the routine of commuting to his office and returning to work in the gardens of the community. He was still very much a junior member of Ouspensky's Circle , although chance had given him an opportunity to approach his teach er more closely than he would other wise have done. By a coincidence, both he and Ouspensky traveled from Liverpool to New York on the Geor gie. Because the ship had to zigzag to avoid U-boats, the voyage was longer than usual, and the young man came to know Ouspensky moderately well during the passage . However, for some time after his arrival at. Frank lin Farm s, Collin was shy of presuming too much on this acquaintance . Frequently, his office work combined with the physical labor of gard ening wore him out so that he fe lt incapable of attending Ou�pensky's evening lectures in New York. \"He normally lay awake ,\" writes his sister-in-law, \"until the lights of the returning car swung into the long drive. Ouspensky would then go intq the big kitchen and sit drinking wine and talking philosophy until the early"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"THE STR}\\NGE DE ATH OF PYOTR OUSPENSKY 443 hours .\" Then, one night Collin realized that his lassitude was not simply the result of physical exhau stion: I jumped out of bed and flung on my dressing gown . . . and with the cord trailing behind me, I ran downstairs in a way quite contrary to the controlled discipline of the household. Before my courage failed me, I flung open the kitchen door. I expected to see a number of people more important than mysel f, sitting at the long table. Instead, \"0\" was alone, drinking wine. Before I could stop myself I shouted at him loudly: \"Why am I afraid of you?\" He looked at me calmly and answer ed: \"Why did you say 'J'?\" There are two interpretations of the subsequent rapproac hment between the two men. One, which emanates more or less from Ouspensky's directorate , maintains that Rodney Collin took advantage of the circum­ stances which thrust him into Ouspensky's company from the time they sailed together on the Georgie and that the appare ntly close relationship which grew up between them was unwished for by Ouspensky. The other holds that as a result of the incident in the Kitchen at Franklin Farms­ which , as Joyce Collin-Smith writes, Rodney Collin \"looked back on ... as a time of revelation \"-O uspensky began to take particular note of his young foUower. \"Thereafter he graduaUy drew Rodney nearer hims elf, as his chauff eur, personal attendant and inti n'. ate pupil. Ultimately almost as his son.\" The truth may lie somewhere in betw een the two versions, and­ predictably-on the truth may depend yet further conflicting possibilities. What is indisputable is that Rodney Collin saw a great deal of Ouspensky. His own view of the developing relationship is given in a biographical note, probably based on inf ormation provided by his wife: ... he spent more and more time with Mr. Ouspensky, driving him to and from New York for his meetings and usually spending the evening with him in a restaurant or in his study at Franklin Farm s. He became deeply attached to Mr. Ouspensky in a way that included without being limited by, personal affection and respect. While fo rmerly he had concentrated on Mr. Ouspensky's teaching, it was now the teacher and what he was demonst rating which occupied Rodney's attention. As the wordiJ;lg of this note implies, the Ouspensky who arrived in America was a little more accessible, a little less the magisterial source of wisdom of whom everyone in England stood in awe. Partly this was because he was in the United States (Russians are crows , Gurd jieff remarked about his supporte rs, English sheep, and Americans burros), and the role which"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"444 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE he had to play was different. Partly there may have been a sense of relief at escaping from his large organization . In America Ouspensky had his own reputation apart fr om any association with Gurdjieff. Tertium Organum still lingered in the minds, and in the librar ies, of a whole generation of intellectua ls. In an article which appeared in the South Atlantic Quarterly in October 1941, nicely timed to coincide with the beginning of Ouspensky's lectures in New York, Sarah Newmayer described how Tertium Organum had provided a rational justification fo r her belief in imm ortality . She recom mended the book \"to all those who ... must bring even the hope of imm ortality to the bar of reason\"; a powerful argu ment in time of war. Also, the New Model had been received more sympathetically in the United Stat es. But on the one hand, Ouspensky was meeting less reverent questione rs-like the one soon after his arrival who asked what evidence there was that a cat really did have an astral body (to which Ouspensk y answered unconcernedly that it all had to do with the connection of cente rs�and on the other, there was some trouble with fo rmer supporters of Orage . C. S. Nott had also emigrated from England and set about collecting Orageans fo r Ouspensky's lecture s. Both the Ouspenskys banned any mention of Beelzebub's Tales- THE BOOK with which both Gurd jieff and Orage were identified in New York . And there were times when Orage 's teaching clashed directly with what Ouspensky now taught. For examp le, in mid-July 1941, Ouspensky was faced with a question which centered round Orage's dictum that \"individua lity is consciousness of will.\" He replied that this was a mere fo rm of words unrelated to what Gurd jieff had said. The remark was Orage's alone; and Orage had forgotten a lot and had had to make things up. Ouspensky arrived in New York in March 1941, and his lectures seem to have begun that summer. They took place in a studio in an apartment house on 78th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues where the incessant noise from the Third Avenue EI provided a jarring acco mpaniment to Ouspensky's heavily accented voice. His audiences numbered between thirty and fifty; but he fo und great difficulty in collecting a permanent group of followe rs. In the first year perhaps only half a dozen lasted the course. Gradually the Ouspenskys' activities once more expande d. In late 1942, Franklin Farms was acqu ired, and Ouspensky began to select people from his audience to spend weekends at Mendham. The pattern of life at Lyne was reprodu ced, with farmwork and housework fo r the pupils. Gurd jieff's movements were taught by two fo rmer colleagues of Orage . Even the magnificence of the dinners at Lyne was translated to the New World, and a party fo r Mme. Ouspensky's name-day would see all the guests in fo rmal evening dress. As in England, there was a definite split between \"Mr."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE DEATH OF PYOTR OUSPENSKY 445 Ouspensky's people\" and \"Madam's people\"; and once more, Ouspensky seems only with reluctance to have accepted his wife's insistence on a large organiza tion. At Mendham, he kept to himself and did not even appear fo r the meals at which his wife would apply the lash of her tongue to selected victim s. One of her pupils, who also met Gurdjieff, has remarked on the similarity between Mme. Ouspensky and her Master: I can still feel the sen sation that crept along my spine when I heard Madam approa ching, her cane announcing her as she came closer and closer to the terrace of the dining room. Although small in stature, she looked and towered above us all through the sheer strength and poise that radiated from her presence. When she reached the long narrow tables at which we sat, everyone remained motionle ss, eyes glued to one spot, simultaneously wishing to draw her attention and yet to become invisible to her. To some of those who were closer to the milder and more sinuous approach of her husband, Mme. Ouspensky appeared as a terrible and vengeful mother. In America the contrast between her ferocity and Ouspensky's \"elegance and eloquence\" as a human being became in­ creasingly mark ed. One pupil, who used to dine on prawns with Ouspensky in one of the Longcham ps restaur ants, remembers him chiefly not as a teacher, but as a gracious host, a kind and feeling person, of \"infinite charm .\" \"There was a refinement and a lovely decency about him.\" In contra st, Sophia Grigorievna appeared to be a dark manipulator of occult forces, and Ouspensky's own \"innocent\" disposition seemed \"bewildered and terrified\" by his wife. His dining companion of the war years recalls \"a man still in search\" of something he had not found: \"He died in sadne ss.\" As he grew older, Ouspensky withdrew more and more from human contact. He would sit for hours with a few of his p\"ll pils, drinking wine in total silence. Some pupils considered this a teach ing gambit; but it could as well be seen as the watch spring running down . And Ouspensky's calm was broken by outbursts of a frustration which had been mounting since before he left England. He had been very gloomy during his last months at Ly ne, questioning whether he would ever malCe contact with the elusive \"Inner Circle .\" On one occas ion when his step-daughter was very depressed, she asked him for advice : Ouspensky shouted at her, \"Pray, Lenotchka, pray!\" If he had begun to believe that his own objective-the attainment of the higher consc iousness wMch he had so restlessly pursued in Russia -was unattainable, prayer may have come to seem the only way out. Nott used to visit him during the war in his New York apartment. He found that Ouspensky's drinking had become even heavier: \". . . he was"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"446 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE drinking strong concoct ions that I could not take. 'You must have a stomach of iron,' I said one day when he offered me one of them. 'It's too strong for me .' He said, 'It's the only thing that relieves the boredom and depression that comes over me at times .''' A new printing of A New Model of the Universe appeared with a publisher's notice stating that Ouspensky was working with Gurdjieff in a community near London. Ouspen sky was furious and wanted to withdraw the book or give a press conference to correct the false impression. His outbursts of temper became more frequent, and a challenge to his position in England by J. G. Bennett did not improve matters. In 1941 Bennett and some of his pupils spent a holiday in the Welsh mountains where Bennett had undergone a series of visionary experi ences. These seemed to him to reveal the secrets of universal order, and he began to explain the visions to his group, making use of the terminology of the System. Reports of this reached Ouspen sky in America, and a letter of May 1942 reminded Bennett of the rule that no one was to write anything without permission. Ouspensky forbade public use of the System and disparaged Bennett's speculations in multidimensi onal mathemat ics. \"He then went on to say,\" Bennett writes, \"that nothing new can be found by intellectual processes alone, and that there is only one hope: that we should find the way to work with the higher emotional centre. To this he added the sad comment: 'And we do not know how this is to be don e.'\" Reverberations of this quarrel reached New York. People who attended Ouspensky's meetings heard loud condemnations of Bennet t's plagiarism and perfidy. Ouspensky's suspicions were fanned by distance, and as Bennett continued to follow his own line, the reports from those in England who were content merely to wait for their Master's return made matters worse. The climax of the quarrel came in the middle of 1945, when Bennett was unable to contain his frustration at the lack of initiative shown by the guardians of Lyne Place, and positively invited repudiation by giving a series of public lectures on the System to a large audience. At Ouspensky's command he was summoned to Lyne, where the senior members of the directorate took him to task. He then received a letter from Ouspensky's solicitor demanding that he return all the material-in the form of lectures and manuscripts -which he had received from Ouspensky. The Lyne contingent were forbidden to have any contact with him on any subject whatsoever. This seems the act of a failing and jealous man, even though it is quite clear that Bennett had transg ressed. But was he the plagiarist and \"thief\" whom Ouspen sky vilified in New York? In Bennett's protest against the stagnant attitude adopted by the orthodox lies the germ of conflict between those who were to struggle during the next ten years to \"keep the System"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE DEATH OF PYOTR OUSPENSKY 447 pure\" and those like Bennett who saw the material they had been given as incomplete and demanded the right to supplement it. This shows more clearly than anything that Ouspensky's presentation encouraged at least two views as to the nature of the System. Orage saw a Met hod at the root of the teachi ng. Ouspensky saw a System; but systems can either be ends in themselves or fo undations fo r new and improved systems: true pictures of the world or means to att aining a true picture . It is always possible that Ouspensky was taki ng steps to ensure that Bennett struck out on his own. In Witness, Bennett describes several occasions when he was told by Mme. Ouspensky that he must try to be more hims elf; that in his work with his group he was not to imit ate his teacher's methods. It is not outside the bounds of possibility that this was the sort of dismissal received by Maurice Nicoll. There is also the possibility that Ouspensky was what he appeared to be: an old and disillusioned man, suffering from insecurity and illnes s. But what are we to make of this sembl ance of age and disapp ointment? Near the end of the war the couple who had superintended the community at Lyne made their way to Mend ham against innum erable difficultie s. They fo und Ouspensky disabled \"as if by a stroke\" and \"a sort of prisoner\" at Franklin Farm s. He told the husband that he had little time left to live. He was to return to England, derequisition Colet Gardens from the Navy who had occupied the building, and restore it as quickly as possible in preparation fo r Ouspensky's arrival . There were considerable obstacles in the way of this pro ject; but, to the accompa niment of incessant complaints from Ouspensky that the task was taking too long, it was eventually carried out. Ouspensky gave his last lectures in New York in the summer of 1946, and announced to his followers-who by this time numbered about sixty-that he was returning to Eng land. Tho se who went to Mendham would be taught by Mme. Ouspensky, but the others would have to \"find their own bearin gs.\" The effect on his pupils was catac lysmic; several ambled aimlessly from philosophy to philosophy until finally coming to rest with the remain ing New York fo llowers of Gurdjieff . From evidence of the pupil who was directed to restore Colet Gardens, it is clear that Ouspensky's return was long premeditated and part of a deliberately conceived plan. But there are other rumors that he decided to base himself in Britain because his wife had invited Gurdjieff to Mendham; and if she had done so, Ouspensky's reaction would have been consistent with his decision in 1922 that if Gurdjieff. settled in London, he would go to Paris or the United Stat es. Ouspensky landed in England in January 1947. His state of health prof oundly shocked his closer disciple s. They had heard that he was ill, then that he was better again. Kenneth Walker saw him as \"aged\" many"},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"448 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE years, \"both in mind and in body, and there were other changes in him as well. . . . It was . . . obvious to us that Ouspensky would be unlikely to be able to carry out whatever he intended to do . . . he appeared to me to be a man who had lost all of his former enthusiasm and drive .\" The nature of Ouspensky's illness was not known at the time, as he refused to submit to treatment; but it was in fact a form of kidney failure exacerbated by his drinking habits. He was driven directly to Lyne Place from the ship at Southampton and emerged into the publi c gaze only for six momentous meetings at Colet Gardens. The question which faced his pupils was: what would become of the teach ing which they had l1Sed as a life be lt for so long? They had relied completely on their teacher and obeyed his prohibitions on taking in new recruits. With the exception of Bennett, they had waited patiently for their Master's return. Since 1941 very little had happened. Kenneth Walk er, feeling some of the same pressures that affected Bennett, had published three books which referred peripherally to the System. His Diagnosis of Man (1942) had been written during the Blitz and appea led for world reform by means of internal rather than external change. The same year The Circle of Life discussed \"the circle of recurrence \"; and both books made great use of the New Model . By 1944, in Meaning and Purpose, Walker was already beginning to repeat himself, and all three books merely posed gigantic questions that revealed an underlying desperation on their author's part. Ouspensky's British fo llowers were in a bad way, and the return of the Master was to have provided artificial respirati on. Dr. Francis Roles had collected three hundred people-the number at which the membership of the Histo rico-Psychological Society had been fixed -and the shock which Ouspensky's appearance gave this wider audience was as great as that to the inner circle of his pupils. Perhaps because of infirmities which prevented him from hearing correctly, perhaps because of some purpose of his own, Ouspensky used a Miss Quinn, who had accom panied him from America, as a \"tran smitting station\" between himself and his pupils. If she could not understand a particular question, it was deemed unanswera ble; and very few questions met with approval . Ouspensky appeared to be administering to his audience en bloc the treatment which overimaginative or pretentious inquirers had received before the war. Questions were bounced back like balls hitting a blank wall. Added to this was the difficulty of hear ing Ouspensky, who spoke in fragm ents and even more ungramma tically than usual. What precisely did he mean by his conduct at these final meetings? The writer J. M. Cohen had first heard of the System during the war years and was one of the newco mers who were prepared to meet the exalted figure of prewar legend. In a broadcast talk entitled, \"In the Work, \""},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"THE STRAN GE DEA TH OF PYOTR OUSPENSK Y 449 he has described his impressions of the first three of Ouspensky' s last series of meetings: The room contained upwards of three hundred people, all of them middle class. The atmosphere was tense in a way that I came to recogn ise as chara cteristic; the ticking of names on attendance sheets was performed with ritual gravity. When we had been sittin g silently for perhaps ten minutes, Ouspensky mounted the two steps to the stage . He was short, iron-grey with a very stern and straight glance, and he walked with a stick. Every movement was clearly a painful effort. He was a very sick man .... Ouspensky asked for questions. They came in the jargon of the System, . . . but each one was stonewa lled. \"Be simpler ,\" rapped the commanding voice with the strong Russian accent. \"Start from what you know.\" \"What do you want? Be simpler and we can begin .\" But nothing did begin . . . one question stands out from those three evenings. It was asked by Kenneth Walker, the surgeon, who was one of Ouspensky's oldest pupils. \"Do you mean, Mr. Ouspensky, that you have aban doned the System?\" The answer was a thunderbolt: \"There is no System .\" What did the Master-or the sick man-require of his pupils? The first three meetings took place on February 24, March 5, and March 12. At the first, Ouspensky refused to tell his questioners what he wanted from them. He had given them no plan of activities when he left for America. What was this \"teaching\" to which they referred? He had given no teaching. He refused absolutely to answer any questions posed in the terms which he had used before the war. He asked his audience what they wan ted: if they told him, if they gave him material to work on, he might be able to do something. At the second meeting, the audience tried hard to discover the terms in which they must put their questions in order to receive an answer. Again, Ouspensky scoffed at questions about \"mechan­ icalness\" and \"self-rem emberin g.\" What did these terms mean? Who had told them that they were mechanical , he inquired, and why did they believe this? They must not believe anything. Questions posed in more general or more indefinite ways were treated with similar sarc asm. Those about the meaning of Christianity were dismissed as great imp onderables. No one would ever know what Christ really taught, just as no one would ever know what life was all about. He, Ouspensky, could not go on repeating the same things; over and over again. He possessed nothing of any importance to give them; indeed, he said, he owned nothing at all. In one of his published letters, Rodney Collin recalled how his Master answered a pupil who asked, \"How can one find harmony?\" Ouspensky"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"450 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE replied: \"This is your question? This is my question now, and 1 have no answer .\" Another questioner: \"What is meant by harmony?\" Ouspensky: \"It is a musical term, nothing more .\" From the first two meetings, two themes emerged which threw the pupils back upon their own resour ces. They must have an aim, a strai ghtf orward everyday aim. And only by onese lf could any effort be made to achieve anything. This seemed to overthrow the whole elaborate idea of \"school\" and \"rules\" which had existed bef ore the war; and by the third meeting, the implications of this train of thought were becoming clear er. Some years ago, said Ouspensky, they ha d had a \"system\" which they discussed; but at the outbreak of the war they had come to the conclusion that this would not help. He had never known even what the first step along the road to self -mastery should be. Now he no longer believed in the possibility of change . And to a worried lady who asked why he would not help them, Ouspensky returned bleakly that he could help no one, because he had no help to give. Finally, he closed the meeting beca use he said that there were no simple questions and that the ref ore he could not answer anything to the purpose. He might come again if his audience wished it. After a long gap, two more meetings were held on May seventh and twenty-first. These were much shorter than the first three, but Ouspensky seemed better pleased with the questions which were asked. Then came the last meeting on June 18. Although obviously fai ling and unable to answer clearly, Ouspensky did appear to provide one guideline: a simple rei nforcement of his instruction to each person to find out what he or she want ed: to try, test, and sample life to discover one's true inclinati ons. He closed this final meeting with the hope that he might see them again if he remained in Eng land. Perhaps, he said, som e time was left him. Afterward he had to be helped from the lecture room and-out of sight of his audie nce-was given an injectio n. The plan of returning to The United States must have already fo rmed in his mind, and it has been suggested that he had resolved to try the same gambit in New York which had so disconcerted his Eng lish pupils. He shut himself up at Lyne Place and announced that he would sail to America on September 4. \"On that day,\" writes Rodney Collin, \"we went to South­ ampt on, put our luggage on board , and were ready to lea ve. A few hours bef ore the boat was due to sail, he arrived at the �ock and suddenly said quietly, \"I am not going to America this time .' It was like the 'stop' exercise on the scale of the whole Work. A stop was made in many lives, everyon e's personal plans were turned upside down , and a space made in the momentum of time where something quite new could be do ne.\" The last month of Ouspensky's life is the most extraordinary .and problematic time in his entire existence. To say that his fo llowers were"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"THE STRAN GE DEATH OF PYOrn OUSPENSKY 451 shaken and puzzled after the meetings at Colet Gardens is understating the case. The sudden countermanding of the Ameri can trip was left until the last minute; the dock gates had even been opened so that the invalid's car could drive directly up to the liner. It was yet another disloca tion in the expected pattern of events; and already among those who hoped to begin again where they had left off in 1940, a number of conflicting interpretations of what Ouspensky meant at his final meetings had begun to gain ground. And possibilities multiply once more .... The differences of opinion were supplemented by private conversations which members of the old directorate had with Ouspensky. Kenneth Walker felt that Ouspensky's private utterances confirmed the impressi on that \"he was a very deeply disapp ointed man. Something had gone wrong, and somebody had failed but who it was that had failed was never very clear to me. In all probability we were all implicated in the failure which Ouspensky seemed to be feeling so deeply .\" Had the System failed to come up to Ouspensky's expectati ons? Had his pupils failed to make proper use of it? Or had they failed to understand anything at all? On the other hand, to the pupil who had organized the restoration of Colet House, it appeared that sometimes Ouspensky could overcome his physical disabilities and make contact with a deeper and more powerful sort of knowledge than ever before. He felt that Ouspensky had wanted to ensur e that no activities would ever be carried on in his name; that in fact he had meant what he said when he denied the usefulness-and even the very existence ---of the System. This point of view was supported by Ouspensky's emphatic declarati ons that In Search of the Mira culous was not to be published. Others agreed that Ouspensky had wished t o call a halt to activity of the kind which had become familiar, but argued th at this was because he wanted to give his fo llowers a fresh start and encourage new approach es. During the last month of the Master's life, the uncertainty generated by his last meetings produced a uniquely charged a tmosphere among his followers. To Rodney Collin the dying man was transf ormed into a repository of new meanings, significance incarnate . Even before the abortive expedition to America, the force had been accumulating around Lyne. Ouspensk y \"hardly spoke at all even to the people who were eating and sitting with him,\" Rodney Collin writes. \"Yet one had the sense that everyth ing that was done was a kind of demonst ration, and gradually an atmosphere developed which can hardly be described. . . . He showed the few who were with him, without explana tion, what it means for a man to pass consciously into the realm of the spirit .\" The strangest feature of Ouspensky's last month was that he and his fo llowers took long car joumeys-often through the night, alwa ys without"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"452 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE fo od, and with the Master's cats acco mpanying him-to parts of England which he had previously known . He drove to West Wickh am, to Seven­ oaks, to Gadsden, and to Maurice Nicoll's old seaside cottage. The expeditions were seen as of portentous significance by some members of the entourage . On one occasion the group returned to Lyne and parked in fr ont of the house. Ouspensky did not climb out with the others but stayed in his seat surrounded by his cats . He remained in the car all night, and one of the more dramatic ladies looking after him stood motionless at the window, her arm ceremoniously raised in salute. Two prominent fo llowers of Gurd jieff visited Ouspensk y in his last days and came away with the impression of an invalid making prodigious eff orts to overcome physical disability. If meaning is read into everything, there is a risk that it may be read wr ongly. And there is a version of Ouspensky's death which holds that he did not agree to the lengthy and labor ious expedit ions, that he was too ill to know what he was doing, and that it was largely the idea of Rodney Collin to make those curious pilgrimage s. The generally ac cepted view is that Ouspensky wanted to fix in his mind the places he had known with a view to \"remember ing\" them in his next recurre nce. Kenneth Walker wri tes that he often spoke of recurrence to his pupils in the last weeks of his lif e. They had the impression that there was something Ouspensky \"wished fe rvently to chan ge\" the next time around. Ever since the publication of A New Model of the Universe, Ouspensky had been plagued by questions about recurre nce. He always emphasized that the theory was not ess ential to the System, although he had synthesized it satisfactorily with Gurd jieff's ideas . The condition of mechanical man is that of ceasele ss repetition; but someone who wants to wake up may perhaps be able to change the cycle . His ideas had altered considerably since writing Ivan Osokin, and the pessimism inherent in the idea of recurrence was harnessed to the Syst em. It provided both the stick and the carrot: the motive for waking up and the goal at which to aim. The prison house in which man was confined could be seen as a fo rtress constructed of recurring liv es. Like \"people of byt,\" people connected with the \"events\" of history could never hope to escape from the place they occ upied in the gigantic construction , otherwise the whole edifice would colla pse. But the \"invisible\" man, who had avoided becoming a cornerstone of history, would have comparatively little difficulty in escaping. No one would notice a pebble dislodgi�g itself from the mortar between the massive blocks . Ouspensky taught that the possibility of escape fr om recurrence came when a man met an esoteric scho ol. He rewrote the early draft of Ivan Osokin inserting the character of a magician to whom Osokin goes after his love aff air appears to be ending unhappily . The magician repre sent� the Work . He has certain characte ristics of Gurdjieff and some of Ouspens ky' s"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE DEATH OF PYOTR OUSPENSK Y 453 own: he is something of a bonviveur; his room is hung with Oriental carpets, and he favors cats . It is this magician who sends Osokin back in time and allows him to watch himse lf make the same mistakes all over again. Ouspensky recommended an analog ous practice to his pupils, advising them to relive the events of their lives in order to avoid the repetitions-or \"recurrence s\"-wh ich provide each person with his per­ sonal blind alleys. His character Osokin decides after all not to shoot hims elf, and the magician gives him the opportunity to escape from his cycle of languid fa ilures. The solution fo r Osokin is to devote fifteen years of his life to study with the magician . And he is warn ed that, fo r thos e who have guessed \"the great secret ,\" \"time is counte d.\" They either evolve or degenerate very quickly in their cycles of recurrence-and finally they cease to be born. What was it that Ouspensky wanted to change in his next recurre nce? Did he want to take up \"school work\" at an earlier period next time around? Walker half implies that his break with Gurd jieff lay on his conscience, but other witnesses declare that Ouspensky wished to fr ee himself from the specter of Gurd jieff in any fu ture life. At the beginning of Ivan Osokin, the disconsolate hero tells a fr iend of his fe eling of being \"cut off fr om life.\" \"You have your life now, \" Osokin says \"and a fu ture ahead of you. I tried to climb over all the fe nces and the result is that I have nothing now and nothing fo r the future! If only I could begin again fr om the beginni ng!\" This is the state ment of a man disillusioned both with \"life\" and his attempts to reach beyond it. Did he simply want to relapse into conventional existence ? This is doubtf ul, because the whole idea of recurrence had by 1947 become indissolubly linked to Gurd jieff's teaching on self-remembering. In :System terms, Ouspensky declared that what recurred was a person's essence. But although essence could only recur, memory could become immortal . Mer e moments of self-remembering were relatively useless. 'The whole thing is to create a continuity .\" A continuous memory might help in remembering, in waki ng up next time. It was here that the Vivi dness of his own childhood memories assumed a particular importance . During his last years in New York, Ouspensky was preoccupied with the theme of developing memory in recurrence . In the fragmentary records of his talks from late 1944 to late 1945, the topic predominate s. He said that he was preparing a book on memory and declared that even theoretical knowledge of recurrence could alter the facts. On another occasion he revealed that he had once advocated teac hing the System to imaginative people who could acquire ,c;ome understanding of the concept. He even told one group that for them, recurrence was the most important idea of all. At what stage do we step off the endless belt? When do we become free?

The sick Master ended his expe ditions and retired to his room. It is hardly possible to call what took place \"events\"; fo r whatever was going on becam e confusing, even distressing, to those who were present. Memories of the period are clouded; more than one person has claimed that Ouspensky died in their arm s; and as to what it all meant, no one not present would be able to pass judgment. Several interpretations of the circumstances surrounding Ouspensky's death sprang up-but because these are based on participation in an unimaginable atmosphere, it is quite impossi ble to say what really happ ened. One passage in literature seems to correspond to the hints and brief writings about the period. It is the section of Memories, Dreams, Reflectio ns, in which C. G. Jung records the circumstances in which he began his Seven Sermons to the Dead: \"The whole house was filled as if there was a crowd present, cram med fu ll of spirits. They were packed deep right up to the door, and the air was so thick it was scarcely possible to breathe .... \" The fo rces which had taken Lyne Place in their grip-wh ether they were subjective or in any sense \"objective\" ---c ame from the world of the miraculous which the dying man had sought so long. Communi cation went beyond the verbal thre shold. Some people fe lt that knowledge came seeping through the limits of the three-dimensional world by some divine osmosis, that they were in touch with \"the inner circle of humanit y.\" The dying man seemed able to commu nicate his ideas telepathically, to such an extent that one of his atte ndants, scared of becoming the victim of her own imagination , asked that he use words alone . Ouspensk y accepted this reasoning and compli ed. . The house was overshadowed . One witness remembers Ouspensky sitting in the Green Dra\\V ing Room , when a powerful presence seemed to press upon his compa nions. Ouspensky spoke : \"You notice ?\" he said. Was he the vehicle fo r fo rces greater than man? \"What was going on,\" says one pupil, \"was God's business .\" In the words of anot her: \"He was an angel: don't you underst and that?\" In the terms of the System, Ouspensky had equated the \"angels\" of the Christian hierarchy with the degree of being repre sented as \"pla nets\" on Gurd jieff's Ray of Creation . There was a sense that in some way those at Lyne were participating in an ascension. Also that it had been planned before. In the da)\"S of 55a Gwendwr Road , 2 pupil had gone to the flat to find the door opened by Ouspensky hims elf. \"I only kno w,\" said the pupil, \"that I have to be W ith you when you die.\" \"Quite right,\" said Ouspensky, and so it proved. In his later New York lectures he had often returned to the theme of \"mi racle ,\" defined in the terms of the System as \"the laws of a higher cosmos operating in a low er.\" There was a sense that in the mir acle of his death, Ouspensky was somehow creating a mys tical body of which his fo llowe rs were part. \"'I will always be"},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"THE STRAN GE DEA TH OF PYOTR OUSPENSK Y 455 with you,' he too could say,\" Rodney Collin remembered, \"but lightly and smoking a cigarette so that none noticed .\" One of those present at Lyne declares that he \"saw him succeed during the last month of his life in his life-long aim of experiencing 'cosmic conscious ness.' During and after this experience two more eye-witn esses agree with me that he was a completely changed man-no longer the man who wrote the books or conducted the groups in London and New York.\" But to Rodney Collin, the miracle appeared to be enacted also for the benefit of Ouspensky's pupils. It was partly the culmination of the teaching which Ouspensky provided merely through existing, partly the last act in a gigantic mystery play. The idea of the mystery play derives from Ouspensky himself, but is indirectly influenced by Gurdjieff' s teaching of the uses of the stage in antiquity . When in A New Model of the Universe Ouspensky discusses the parts men play in the cycles of recurrence, he ref ers to the particular sort of roles acted by men who are members of \"esoteric schools.\" These men are more conscious than the corps-de-ballet of mechanically repeating people, and their roles are consciously directed . The perfect instance of a drama connected with an esoteric school is \"the drama of Christ.\" Ouspensky connected the Gospel drama with the Greek mystery plays, which for him represented the outer courts of an esoteric school which trained candidates by \"a consecutive and gradual introduction to a new cycle of thought and feeling.\" The purpose of the theatrical representation of the mystery schools and the historical drama of Christ was the same; the diff erence was \"that the latter was played in real life.\" Under the circumstances it was not unnatural to compare the death of a revered teacher in apparently miraculous circumstances to the Crucifixion scene of the Gospel drama. Rodney Collin saw Ouspensky's death as providing an equivalent experience in the drama of the Work, and he applied his Master's dicta about Christ to Ouspensky himself. He wrote an account of Ouspensky's last days called Last Remembrances of a Magicia n, which still exists but is inaccessible. After Ouspensky died this was circulated in typescript until objections-quite possibly to the part allotted to its author-forced Rodney Collin to withdraw it. He then issued another version with the offending passages blocked out in the style of a wartime censor. This account has never been published. Rodney Collin's version of events is complicated by the fact that he saw himself as having an important part to play in the drama of Ouspensky's death . This part demanded that he supplement the failing resources of his Master with his own. Just as the Work teacher created situations which would tax his pupils' predispositions to the utmost, Collin saw it as his duty to force Ouspensky to act counter to his \" automatic\" instincts-the feelings"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"456 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE and sensations of a very sick man. By resi sting the \"norma l,\" mechanical imperatives of a diseased body, Ouspensky might remain conscious in his last hours, and at the last \"die consci ously.\" The struggle for full consci ousness was an additional reason for the long motor drives and the minor exertions which filled Ouspensky's last days. Collin believed that his teacher had explicitly delegated this task to him; but those who object that Ouspensky was bamboozled into taking his motor expeditions would also object that Rodney Collin's behavior just before Ouspensky's death bore little relationship to the facts of what occur red. Last Remembrances of a Magician is a title, one of Ouspensky's for mer followers write s, \"which at any rate until he was too ill to know what he was doing or saying, Ouspensky would have loathed and repudiat ed.\" What we know of Collin's conduct gives a certain weight to this idea. He returned to England with Ouspensk y in January 1947, temporarily leaving his wife with Mme. Ouspensky at Mendham. There is some evidence that his attentions were unwelco me-that the intimate position which he felt himself to occupy was not a matter of choice on Ouspensky's part. One particular incident demons trates this. Sitting in the drawing room at Lyne, Ouspensky became extremely angry with Rodney Collin and started shouting at him, ending by hitting him across the face. Collin interpreted this in his own fashion, and \"completely slap-happy ,\" turned around and delivered a stinging blow to the head of Dr. Francis Role,s , which broke the docto r's eardrum. The episode was construed by Collin as a form of initiation, and shortly afterward, he acted on this assumption. He caught a plane across the Atlantic and went posthaste to Mendham. Later he wrote that Ouspensky \"possessed\" him \"with his own mind\" during the flight. On his arrival at Franklin Farm s, he consider ably scared Mme. Ouspensky by assuming the manners and voice of her husband and implying that the mantle of the dying Master had fallen on him. Nothing more is known about this interview, except that, after it had taken place , Collin returned to England and the house of miracles at Lyne. Lyne Place was overshadowed ... . In November 1951, Collin wrote : \"Among the many extraord inary impressions at the time of Ouspensky's death there was-particularly at one period-the 1mmensely strong feeling of some great power or being, some Christ-li�e being, as far above Ouspensky as Ouspensky was above us, p residing over all that was being done.\" And in March of that year, he sum med up in a single letter the theology which he developed from Ouspensky's last days: All the literally miraculous things that happened at Ouspensky's death, and everything that has developed since-both for me personally and"},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE DEATH OF PYOTR OUSPENSK Y 457 in relation to his work as a whol e----co nvince me that he did not die as ordinary men die, but that he reached a level where a man becomes immortal, or at any rate where he is not confined to time as we know it, but can act and make connections through time .... Further, if he did so become independent of time, or if he had acquired fo urth body (if you like to be technical) then he is ac cessible now to anyone who desires his help with sufficient urgency and belief. The lectur es, the whole system as he explained it, were indeed the explanation of how to do the impossible, of how miracles are achi eved. How then should we be surprised that Ouspensky himself actually put this knowledge to the use fo r which it was intended, and eVidently expected those who fo llowed him to take it the same way? Looking back I am appalled to remember how we took it all as a method of making slight ad jus tments to our personal psychology .... But what actually hap pened? Without a blow-by-blow account of events , there is little to be said. Few people know the answer, and some of those who do have put fo rward the most disturbing ideas . Rodney Collin, of course, described Ouspensky's conduct as an example of \" work\"-of \"super-eff ort, \" as Gurd jieff would have said-a demonst ration of how to tum the most ad verse circu mstances to good acc ount. \"One of the most extraordinary things was to see how he turned every unf avourab le trick of fa te-separation from his fr iends, distortion of his ideas , physical weakness and pain, into advanta ges, and by willingly abandoning normal p owers and facu lties was enabled to achieve supernormal ones of infinite ly greater valu e.\" Even if we do not dispute the miracu lous which engu lfed Lyne Place, it is easy to see how Rodney Collin might have read into Ouspensky's slightest actions the sense of an event which he already half -expected. For exam ple, if Ouspensky had been trying to keep him at arm 's length , the follOwing sentence from a letter of July 15, 1949 is easily expla ined: \"In Ouspensk y's last months one saw how he accep ted being old, sick, ugly, helpl ess, in pain , misunderstood, and indeed did everything to prevent others comf orting him, to suffer conscio usly, to make it more difficult fo r him to be understood .... \" Was it not simply that the disciple's advances had been rebuff ed in irrita tion? Collin admits that fa ith alone kept at bay disillusion and bewilderm ent. \"While if fo r a moment that fa ith was lost, what was being done actually became fo r the doubter no more than the vagar ies of an old man who had lost his mind .\" What ever possibility is acce pted , it is clear that Ouspensky was making stupendous effOrts to fo rce his weak ening body into extended act ivity . In"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"458 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE The Theory of Eternal Life Rodney Collin describes how, after his journeys through England, his Master continued to exert himself gratuit ously. When almost unable to set one foot before the other he would make his dying body walk step by step fo r an hour at a time through the rough lanes; fo rce it to rise in the small hours, dress, descend and climb long flights of stairs; turn nigh t into day; and require of his companions in order to remain with him, such feats of endurance as they in full possession of health and strength were scarcely able to accomplish. And again in a letter of August 23, 1952: A little before his death Ouspensky after having spent a whole night fo rcing his dying body to walk , and waking us in order to make many expe riments, said to me: \"Now do you understand that everything has to be done by effort or do you still think that things come right by themselves ?\" A fortnight before his death , Ouspensky assembled his inner circle and told them that they must \"not be afraid to take second step .\" They must reconstruct everything fo r themselves \"-f rom the very beginning .\" His companions were convinced that their Master was undergoing the transmutation before their eyes. The unseen presences attended them; fo r the wall between here and there had been breac hed. Telepathic effects reached fa r beyond Lyne itse lf, as dimensions and cosmoses merged to produce their miracle s. The epigraph to Tertium Organum had looked forward to a day when \"there shall be time no longer .\" The words of one Apocalyp se contained the shadow of anot her. On the last day of his life, Ouspensky got up and dressed. Brushing aside all restraint, he came downstairs and summ oned the household fo r a final briefing. To Rodney Collin it seemed that \"he was able to commu nicate many ideas in such a way that each perceived in them the solution of his own probl em.\" Ouspensky returned to his room. At dawn the next day, October 2, 1947, he died. In the opinion of his companions this was a \"conscious deat h.\" When his body had been removed fo r burial at Lyne Church , Rodney Collin went to the bedroom where his Master had died and locked himself in. He refused to come out, despite persuasions which became increasingly angry and hostile. The household was already prostrated before the blank ness of the future and had no time fo r an absurd young man compounding their grief. A ladder was placed agai nst the window ledge, and an attempt was made to reach the man inside. The ladder was pushed"},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"THE STRANGE DEATH O F PYOTR OUSPENSKY 459 away from the wall. Six days later the bell of Ouspensky's room rang downstairs in the kitche n. Janet Collin-Smith, who had by now arrived from America, was sent to her husband. She found him sitting cross-legged on Ouspensky's bed, in the words of his sister-in-law, \"emaciat ed, dirty, unshaven. He bore all the signs of having been through a tremendous traumatic experie nce. He had had neither food nor drink during his time of solitude. He asked for lime juice. He adopted a gentle, child-like attitude to those who came to look after him, unlike his usual forthright manner. \" Patently something had happ ened to him; but what he thought this was became clear only later. From this six-day fast a whole new development was to result. For a time, howe ver, there was only confusion and dismay. Ouspensky had depart ed. What were his followers to do? To some, the sun had suddenly ceased to shine; but to others, it seemed that the sacred time, the time of the miracle s, might not be over. The miraculous had extended its influence beyond Lyne, both before and after Ouspensky's death. \"That morning dead,\" Rodney Collin wrote of his teache r, \"he walked with a traveller crossing London Bridge; and to another at the wheel of a car showed the secrets of this universe. \" Neither was he the only member of the group at Lyne who felt the continuing presence of Ouspensky. The strange ness of the attendant phenomena continued to haunt one participant long after 1947. She discovered certain parallels in sacred literature and decided that Dr. W. Y. Evans-Wentz, the editor of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, spoke with the voice of authority. Event ually, she ran Evans-Wentz to earth ; he lived on a mountain sacred to the Indians on the Mexican border. During their conversation Evans-Wentz tried to give his mountain away ; but this concerned Ouspensky's old pupil less than his reaction to her account of Ouspensky's death . \"I always thought Ouspensky was an Arha nt,\" he remark ed: \"now I know that he is.\" Just before Ouspensky died, the printing of Strange Life of Ivan Osokin on the private press used by his fo llowers was completed. Although a copy was taken posthaste to Lyne by the printer, Ouspensky died before he could see it. At his funeral the printer discovered the novel in the glove compart ment of the car. \"Do you remember the end, the very end?\" asked Osokin. \"Yes, I rememb er,\" and slowly she recites the end of the tale: And the King's daughter of Duntrine got her to that part of the beach where strange things had been done in the ancient ages; and there she sat her down.

Had they been freed from the repetition of fixed fo rms or not? And fo r a few, who had been affected by the sense of the miracul ous, the same question posed itself fo r the Master. How to acco unt fo r this sense of his continuing presence? Perhaps his last heroic days had freed him from recurrence . Perhaps he had gone fu rther on, to some inconceivable new beginning. \"One life ends and another begins. One ti1JW ends and another begins . Death is really a return to the beginning .\""},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"14 The Last Suppers During the period of indecision after Ouspensky's death grou ps gathered round two figures, Dr. Francis Roles and Rodney Collin. The directorate could see only one course open: to ask Mme. Ouspensky fo r help. Mme. Ouspensky's own wishes were clear, but shocking: they were to contact Gurdjieff in Paris. There was renewed dissension. Then Mme . Ouspensky w rote to say that plainly, no one had understood anything; it was nonsense that Ouspensky had aban doned everything by which he had lived since meeting Gurdjieff. They were to sell Lyne Place and end their own activitie s. Gurdjieff himsel f took a hand in the game. A comm unication arrived at Lyne reading: \"You are sheep without a shepherd. Come to me.\" This new development caused almost as much consternation as the succe ssive blows of Ouspensky's last meetings and death. His pupils had been fo rbidden to think of Gurd jieff for so long that those who did think of him at all imagined that he was probably dead. Others decided that Ouspensky really had meant that Gurd jieff was mad. To others he was something approa ching the devil incarnate; at the very least a Black Magician . When an artist sketched Ouspensky's death mask, one of the Russian's devoted followers suppressed the picture fo r fear Gurd jieff might acquire it and so obtain a magical hold over Ouspensky's soul. At all events, Ouspensky had parted from Gurd jieff for reasons which no doubt seemed 461"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"462 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE good to him; and who were his pupils to question the decisions of a man from whom they had learned so much? The section which was united in devotion to Ouspensky divided into two main bodies of opinion: those who supported Roles's view that he had a mandate to carry on Ouspensky's work, and those who believed that Ouspensky had tried to put an end to everyt hing. But about half of Ouspensky's fo rmer disciples, under Kenneth Walker, decided to obey the instructions from Mendham. In the spring of 1948, Mme. Ouspensky herself decided to reestablish contact with Gurdjieff and dispatched presents of 300 dollars and a roll of silk. These were regarded as grossly inadequate ; but in answer to a query whether Mme. Ouspensky should be written to and trounced fo r her niggar dliness, Gurdjieff replied: \"No. You out of mouse make elephant .\" The lines were open between Paris and Franklin Farms. Ouspensky's death also affected J. G. Bennett, who had expanded his teac hing activit ies. In 1941 he had acquired a large house called Coombe Springs, standing in extensive grounds in the London suburb of Kingston­ on-Tham es. This became the center of his group which styled itself \"The Institute fo r the Compa rative Study of Hist ory, Philosophy and the Scienc es.\" By the mid-19 40s, two to three hundred pupils were visiting Coombe Springs fo r the sort of act ivities which had prevailed at the Prieure or Lyne Place . Bennett had resolved to take the bold step of publishing a book mentioning the System. At the inauguration of his Institute in 1946, he had delivered a series of lecture s entitled The Crisis in Human Affairs, based partly on a private theory of history and partly on the Syst em. The Crisis in Human Affairs appeared in July 1948---at the precise moment when Bennett learned that Gurd jieff, far from being dead or relapsed into senility as was the common assumption, was very much alive and kicking. On a business trip to the United States he visited Mme. Ouspensky at Men dham and received the same advice as had been given to the emiss arie s fr om Ouspensky's English groups. Trembling inwardly at the thought of con­ fronting the terrifying phenomenon he had last known at Fontainebleau , he returned to England and left with his wife for Paris. Bennett and the Ousp enskians were Johnny-come-lateHes as fa r as Gurd jieff's personal following was conce rned. As soon as warti me condi­ tions permitted, Gurd jieff's pupils had begun to converge fr om every point of the compass on the Rue des Colonels Renard . Two of the ear liest comers had strange tales to tell. Fritz Peters was serving in the American fo rces in Luxembourg. He had fallen into a trough of depression induced by a series of appare ntly miraculous escapes from death and a mounting disgust at the horrors of warf are. Eventually he secured leave and headed for Paris \"very close to"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"THE LAST SUPPERS 463 what I would have to call a form of mad ness.\" Gurd jieff welc omed him with literally open arm s, took in his condition at a glance, and directed him to lie down and rest. Peters was refused aspirin fo r his headache and was given scalding coffee instead. I remember being slumped 'over the table, sipping at my coff ee, when I began to fe el a strange uprising of my energy within myse lf-I stared at him, automatically straighte ned up, and it was as if a violent, electric blue light emanated from him and entered into me. As this happened, I could fe el the tiredness drain out of me, but at the same moment his body slumped and his face turned grey as if it was being drained of life. I looked at him, amaz ed, and when he saw me sitting erect, smiling and full of energy, he said quickly: \"You all right now-watch fo od on stove--I must go. \" There was something very urgent in his voice and I leaped to my fe et to help him but he waved me away and limped slowly out of the room. A quarter of an hour later Gurdjieff returned to the room. \"He looked like a young man again,\" Peters write s, \"alert, smiling, sly and full of good spirits .\" The reunion was celebrated uproariously and acco mpanied by copious quantities of armagnac . Gurd jieff sent Peters away \"convinced ... that he knew how to transmit energy fr om himself to others . . . at great cost to hims elf. \" In the summer of 1946, Kathryn Hulme visited Gurdjieff. She took with her a young Belgian nurse-- an ex-nun -with whom she had been doing relief work in Germany. During their conversati on, Gurdjieff appeared to :,f8l l asleep, and the Belgian girl whi spered that perhaps they had better go . . ' Gurd jieff awoke, smiled at her and-in spite of his total ignorance of her past- named the precise Order of which she had been a member: \"Petite soeur de ... \" As Kathryn Hulme write s, he could have just been commending his visito r's compassion; but this was not an explanation which she would readily accept. Entire groups of pupils arrived at the Rue des Colonels Renard . An ambassador from Jane Heap's London group arrived in 1946, and in the a utumn of that year, Gurdjieff was surprised by roars of laughter which greeted his onslaught on a hapless newcomer who had endured iden tical trea tment at the hands of Jane Heap in London. Building up gradually to a crescendo toward the end of 1948, Gurd jieff's fo rmer pupik-with their; pupils, and their friends, relat ions, and chil­ dren- poured into Pari s to sit at the Master's fe et. They fo und him a little older, a little more tired, but recognizably the same man .

But complications were created by the arrival of so many fo rmer disciples. There was considerable agitation among Gurd jieff's French pupils, who were reminded that the play in which they had taken part was only the latest in a line of long-running succe sses. the new arrivals created a crowd scene where before there had been tastef ul soup ers intimes . Gurd jieff's wartime teaching had not been exactly clandestine, but neither had it been widely advertised. Rumors branching from the circle of Daumal and Lavastine invaded the intellectual community. \"His name passed from mouth to mouth, \" explains Pierre Schaeff er, who met Gurdjieff in 1943; and although no single approach to Gurd jieff was ever exactly like another, Schaeff er's situation at the time may indicate the more general reasons which brought others to Gurdjieff. Within the space of a fe w years, he had had to withstand \"a war lost, a general mist ake in orientation, a naive belief in the possibility of changing the world .\" Gurd jieff saved him from despair. \"You didn't go to Gurdjieff because you wanted to meet him,\" Scha effer told the writer Elizabeth Antebi, \"it happened to you to meet him through a third person .\" With a relatively small number of pupils gathered in this fashion, Gurd jieff had returned during 1943 and 1944 to holding sessions of questions and answers-as he had in Russia and as Ouspensk y had done in his memory fo r so many years at Warwick Gard ens. \"He would prop ose�a field of obser vation,\" says Henri Trac ol, who came to him during the war . Discussion of the results fo rmed the basis of meetings, and the Master might occasionally recommend exercises fo r particular individua ls. He seems to have abandoned the occult cosmology recorded in In Search of the Miraculous, but he was never averse to flashes of Mage ry-to playing the Man Who Knows, allowing his hieratic manner fu ll rein. There was one pupil, fo r example, who had scarcely begun a question- \"M. Gurdjieff, \" whom the Master interrupted, grandly and mysteriously; \"It is a long time now, since I was Gurd jieff ... \" With the increasing demands on his time and on the floor space of his tiny flat, Gurdjieff reverted to more general methods -as he had done when he first arrived in Western Eur ope. He was. now teaching in a more sedentary fashion than before, presiding as a domestic patriarch over a rapidly increasing fa mily. To make up fo r the lack of a Study House there was the Salle Pleyel, where nightly sess ions of the movements were held, which Gurdjieff rarely missed. He retained all his old skill as a \"teacher of dancing\" and his poise and presence in the cla sses never fa iled to make an impreSSion. \"He came in,\" one remembers, \"like a great red light . .. \" With minor variations his routine was the same as it had been fo r Menty"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"THE LAST SUPPERS 465 years, though by the late 1940s it had attai ned the sacrosanctity of ritual. There was the Hat itself-of which every detail impressed itself on visitors. It stood on the first Hoor in the Rue des Colonels Renard, on the right as one entered the building. The block itself was massive and functional, a warren of small Hats like Gurd jieff's own, the street a high­ walled gulley admitting little light -even supposing that Gurdjieff did not close the shutters, in order (as he once wickedly explained) \"to prevent the vibrations from escapin g.\" The Hat itself was unprepossessing. A hallway, which bent to the left, turned into a passage leading to Gurd jieff's room and a spare bedro om. On the right of the hallway was the sitting room, decorated in the most extraordinary fashion. Its wall s, like the walls of the hallway, were covered with the paintings of his \"paras ites\" -not a square inch of wall space was untenanted. On each side of the sitting-room fireplace hung twin representations of the enneagram , made of mother-o f- pearl, sewn to fabric-covered black disks. Under one of these, the Master himself would sit, observing his disciples as they crouched on low, uncomf ortable stools during intermina­ ble readings fr om Beelzebub's Tales . Behind them, in the corners abutting the street, were two strange and glittering artif acts. One was a sort of stylized Christmas tree, made out of some gold-colored metal or gilded wood , which gleamed in the light reHected fr om countless prisms of glas s. The other was a cabinet contai ning a large collection of dolls dressed in different national costumes and an assortment of keepsake s: pipes, musical instruments, Orientalia . When the room was properly lit, the skill of Gurd jieff as a stage designer became as obvious as it had been in the Study House at Fontainebleau . The cheap materials scintillated and sparkled like Aladdin's cave. Encased in their private fa ntasies-more like the Forty Thieves in their jars than Aladdin's genii-the pupils sat under the Master's eye. That is, if they were not next door, in the dining room, where the pictures still clustered thickly on the wall, and there was scarcely room to breathe if Gurdj ieff had a full house. This was where the toasts to the idiots were drunk, as they had been ever since Fontainebleau . The toasts were pro posed by a director-not now the long-dead Schumaker, but an incongruous Paris banker or an English technologi st. It was at Gurd jieff's table that some pupils fe lt most keenly the intensity of the experien ce-and an extraordinary parallel was born in the mind of more than one. Here Gurd jieff would make ritual offerings of dainties to his guests, abuse or comf ort his visitors, comp�l the drunkards to abstain fr om alcohol and the teetotalers to down glass after glass of armagnac or peppered vodka. The food fo r Gurd jieff's feasts would proceed acro ss the hall to the dining room by meaJ;lS of a human chain , which originated in the diminutive"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"466 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE kitchen. Here Gurdjieff cooked his highly spiced dishes on a coal stove, and his pupils washed up in the most primitive of sinks. Next door to the kitchen, and directly to the left of the entrance to the flat, was what fo r many pupils was the most significant room in the house: Gurd jieff's pantry . This room was a study, storeroom and conf essional combined. Its shelves were cram med with bottles and jars, and from them dangled rings of sausages and sheaves of dried herbs. Nudging the delicacies were re­ minders of Gurd jieff's occupation : rosaries or chap lets hanging from nails. On the little table benea th might lie a pile of pape rs, relics of Gurdjie ff's literary work, and a vacu um flask of hot coffee. Kathryn Hulme first knew the pantry during the 1930s; on her return in 1946, she fo und it \"a Lucullian treasure room, its tiers of shelves stacked with boxed, bagged and tinned goods, while overhead hung from the ceiling were garlands of spice bouquets, strung red peppers and imported sausages of every size and colo ur.\" In this aromatic conf usion Gurdjieff would give advice to individual pupils, prescribe exerci ses or listen to their problems. If the French had to reconcile themselves to sharing Gurd jieff with others, the Eng lish and American s, who had been receiving his teaching irregularly or at second or third hand, were fo rced to adapt themselves to his unpred ictable behavior. Those who had been fa miliars of Gurd jieff before the war noticed few changes-but sever al faces were missing from his board . Georgette Leblanc, fo r example, had died in 1941, watched over by Margaret Anderson. In The Fiery Fountains her friend has recorded how the dying woman made prodigious efforts to \"die consciously\" -to watch the core of her being through death. Just before the end she was told that Gurdjieff had called her \"friend\" and seemed overjoyed by the news. \"AJo rs,\" she inquired, \"nous allons mourir sans mourir?\" Memento mori-and there was Gurd jieff himsel f, widely believed to be in his eightie s. \"What shall we do when you die, Mr. Gurd jieff?\" asked one of his pupils. \"I Gurdji eff, \" the Master replied fu riously, \"I not wiU die.\" But the question remained. Pierre Schaeff er atte nded the meetings with the perpetual conviction that the Master would die before he, Schaeff er, would have time to ask him his own question. The fact of death and Gurd jieff's attitude toward it hung suspended over the whole company. A complicated relay of cause and eff ect was set off by the death of Rene Daumal in 1944. Daumal had finally been conquered by tuberculosis and malnutrition-Max-Pol Fouchet, who visited the Daumals in 1942, fo und them drinking hot water to fill their stomac hs. Daumal died in the faith, in the middle of composing Mount Anal ogue while believing himself to be only a beginner on the slopes of his mountain .

A few days before he died, Daumal was photographed by another group member, Luc Dietrich. Dietrich was so affected by the death of his fr iend that he underwent a crisis, as a result of which he abandoned everything and rushed off to Normandy to study the behavior of madmen in a mental hospital . During the Allied bombar dment of the village in which he was worki ng, he develop ed an absce ss on the brain. He died in August 1944, after three weeks of ag ony. Gurd jieff came to visit him in the hospital and brought him two orang es. He placed one in each hand of the invalid with the benedict ion: \"All your life has been a preparation fo r this mome nt.\" One of Dietrich's fr iends was struck by the last tortured glance which the dying man cast at his teacher who stood at his bedside, calmly engaged in his favorite pastime of handing out sweets. This fr iend was Lanza del Vasto, and the sinister impression which Gurd jieff made on him had considerable consequences fo r the Master's reputation . Lanza and Dietrich had been close friends in the days when Dietrich was a poverty-stricken young writer seeking a mentor. Lanza held a degree in philosophy and tended toward mystical speculati on; he was soon to become known fo r fo unding the mystical order \"L'Arche \" and publishing a celebrated narrativ e of his journey to India, felerinage aux sources (1943). While Lanza was in India, Dietrich met Philippe Lavas tine, who intro­ duced him to Mme. de Salzmann, and eventually to Gurd jieff. On Lanza s return he fo und Dietrich converted to the Work; and fo r a time, he, Dietrich, and Lavastine formed a group under Gurd jieff's instruction . Then he became uneasy and tried unsuccessfully to drag Dietrich away. Lanza del Vasto's suspicions of Gurd jieff were significant because of his mys tical proclivitie s. There was already some disquiet about the Work in the ,french occult world. This may have originated in a fe ud between Alexander de Salz m ann and the leading French esotericist, Rene Guenon (1886-19 51). Guenon is said to have admired de Salzmann and sought a meeting; but all atte mpts at a rapproc hement were spoiled by de Salzmann's wicked sense of humor. Guenon was fond of para ding his lack of c o ncern fo r his selfish ego-- \"II n'y a pas de Rene Guenon ,\" he would say, implying that he was at one with the infinite and personally unworthy of the reverence which his disciples bestowed on him. \"II n'y a pas de Rene Guenon? Hela s,\" said Alexander de Salzmann, the fo llower of Gurd jieff in search of his \"Big 1.\" It is uncertain whether this tale had anything to do with Guenon's injunction to his disciples to \"flee Gurd jieff like the plag ue,\" but relations between the Work and the French esotericists were already"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"468 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE strained by the 1940s. When Lan za became eminent in French mystical circles after the publication of Felerinage aux sources, the addition of his voice to those of Gurd jieff' s other opponents meant that the whispering campaign against the Work increased in volume. There was another disturbing death -closely connected with the death of Luc Dietrich. Gurd jieff had singled out Dietrich as a compulsive Don Juan and condemned him to have one woman a day \"and not prostitute s, that's too easy.\" In the early spring of 1942, Lanza, Dietrich, and the Daumals were together on the plateau of Assy in Savoy , in an atmosphere reminiscent of Thomas Mann's The Magic Mounta in. Assy was an area where consumptives came to be cured and this was the reason fo r Daumal's presence there . A young conva lescent named Irene-C arole Reweliotty arrived at the spa: a woman of twenty-one who had suffered from heart trouble since puberty. She had literary ambitions and fell quickly under the spell of Dietrich , the published writer and the accom plished charm er. Dietrich introduced her to the Gurd jieff groups, an event which Irene, at the time, regard ed as the turning point in her life. She recorded her struggles in a diary, published in 1946 as the Journal d'une jeune fiUe . They are struggles fa miliar enough from the writings of Margaret Anderson and the papers of Jean Toomer. She was a machine, she could not write-- fo r what should she write about? She hated herself and next, by a swift reversal, hated the Gurd jieff groups. Then Daumal died and after him Dietrich , her protector and \"elder brother\" in the Work . Shortly before his death he had written to his protegee advising her to distance herself from the Work; but despite her doubts, Irene-Carole continued to attend the groups. Eventually in 1945 she received an invitation to dinner at the Rue des Colonels Renard . During the course of the meal Gurd jieff spoke to her in Russian, a language which none of the others present could underst and. He directed her to pretend to leave with the others and then to return to the fiat. Accordingly she left, but instead of returning, she telephoned Gurd jieff from a cafe and told him that she could not come as her mother was expecting her. Gurd jieff insulted her \"in terms,\" Louis Pauw els write s, \"which seemed to'conceal nothing of his intenti ons.\" The next day, Irene, in a state of shock , went to the disciple who had introduced her to Gurd jieff and announced her departure from the Work. She was turned away in a manner which Pauwe ls does not specify and thrown back on her own resource s, which threatened to abandon her altogether. The bottom had fallen out of her world . In the hopes of reconstituting her universe she returned to Assy where she died unexpectedly of a heart attack . Her last letter to her mother contained the sentence, \"I'll end by thinking �t G. has cast a spell on me.\" ."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"THE LAST SUPPERS 469 The wildest rumors circulated after her death. It was said that her brother had had a vision of Gurd jieff -whom he had never seen, but whom he nevertheless recognized -when he entered the room where his sister had died. There were rumors that inquiries into the case had been suppr essed. The image of the Black Magician rose like some diabolical phoenix out of the ashes. Once mor e-- as in the examples of questionable conduct during the 1920s-there is an element of uncertainty. Even if we discou nt the recurrent vision of Gurdjieff as Bluebeard or Rasput in, there are still disturbing factors about this cas e. It does seem that someone had bungled -wh ether Gurdjieff or the pupil-teacher does not matte r. It may be that Gurdjieff did want to sleep with Irene-Carole, but that is not in itself a crime. Neither can it be said that he directly caused her death. But there can be little doubt that the Work in general and the contretemps with Gurdjieff in particular caused a nervous breakdown ; and that this reacti­ vated a dormant physical or psycho-physical ailment. The dark side of the Work was again in evidence. And, of course, suspicion of Gurdjieff was strengt hened in occult and mystical circ les. It was not as if his reputation was spotless, even on a strictly material plane . Wartime conditions had provided Gurdjieff with a superb oppor­ tunity to stir the pot of violent emotion s; and at the same time, no doubt, to indulge his roguish temperament. His lavish hospitality struck a jarring note at a time of material privat ion: fo r even if the Master expended a great deal of time and money on his pupils, just how, in that occupied city, had he acqu ired the vodka and the delicacies which gave his fe asts their memorable flavo r? He did of course levy dues on his fo llowers-but on at .least one occas ion he lived fully up to the precepts which he embodied in the story of \"Abram Yelov\" and \"Peter Karpenko .\" Looking at the company aro und his board , he lashed out: \"You eat good soup, cost eighty dollars . And you nothing give. You parasit es.\" The instructor of the group reminded .the Master of a 2,000 franc contribution which had been handed to him on .the group's behalf. Far from being ashamed, Gurdjieff launched into the most withering verbal assault, and acted his role with such conviction that one of the instructors seceded altoge ther from the Work, taki ng along a bcxiy of pupils. But was he acting? There were objections on the grounds of patrio tism as well. Gurd jieff admitted to working the black market and collaborating with the Germans. He could fe el no particular loyalties to either side in the conflict and had · enough experience of war and revolution to give him an enviable sangfroid in dealing with the problems of material survival . When his American pupils returned after the war, they expected to find him ill and starving; instead, they fo und the pantry fully stocked and Gurdjieff well"},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"470 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE supplied with cigarettes. He had indeed taken one gamble-that of mobilizing as much credit as he could. He told shopkeepers that he had inherited an oil well in the United Stat es, and that after the war he would pay them everything he owed . The returning Americans bailed him out­ and Gurd jieff was able to stalk proudly into his creditors' shops or offices and announce the arrival of his legacy. But he was sailing close to the wind. Soon afte r the war the police searched his Bat and discovered under his mattr ess quantitie s of foreign currency-gifts from pupils which he had hoarded illegally . The mystery was that Gurd jieff had been warned of the author ities' intention to search the Bat, and not only had he done nothing about the warn ing, but he announced to all and sundry that nothing compromising would ever be fo und. J. G. Bennett, who tells the story , repeats Gurd jieff's statement that his motive had been to experience prison from the inside -although his experiences in both India and Georgia might well have given this tale the lie-and adds that Gurd jieff's \"dossiers with the Surete Publique and the Pref ecture of Paris were bulging with reports of unlawful acti vities of all kinds .\" This was the Sly Man's ambiguity on a quite basic level. There was also the ambiguity of the man-monster. Gurdjieff, after all, was the Great Magician , the Man Who Knows and the fo untainhead of the teac hing. Numbers of Bennett's pupils were shocked and distressed by Gurd jieff's bad language and his terrorizing tactics . One lady who had made the trip from England was so overco me by her first impressions that she stayed away from her next appointment in the Rue des Colonels Renard . Eventually she summoned up her courage and returned, apologiz­ ing to Gurdjieff fo r not staying the course. \"Your loss,\" said Gurdjieff, severely, bidding her farewell, \"your loss.\" Memento moo- would you save your life or lose it? Propelled once more by the friction of affirmation and denial, the timorous and the foolhardy sat and sweated-both literally and metaphorically-through the ordeals in Gurd jieff's Bat. But Gurd jieff could wear another face. The French called the lunches and dinners agapes, or love fe asts. Pierre Schaeff er's essay \"A Modem Thaumaturge ,\" prov ides the best evocation of their atmosphere . \"I fe el obliged to state ,\" Schaeffer writes about Gurd jieff's hospitality, \"that anything (gherkin or pimento) can, with the necessary concentration and human tension, become the way to communion . . . \" This great feast --<!an I say it without shocki ng?-re minded me of anothe r. It was impossible not to think of the Last Supper. Bludgeoned into life, we were taking part in tragic agapes. We dipped our hands in the dish with a Master.

There were swooning Mary Magdale ns, incorrigible Marthas and Nic­ ode muses painfully full of goodw ill. Was Gurdjieff himself aware of these resemblances? The very act of eating, if surrounded by rites, however incongruo us, could not fail to make us think of Holy Communion. The quality of the occasion, the intense meaning which suffused the suffocating, aromatic fiat, Gurd jieff's conduct at the table- these are indicati ons of the many levels on which life at the Rue des Colonels Renard was conducted. As at Fontainebleau, the Master's presence brought extra significance to every remark, every minor incident. Gurdjieff's last suppers were Last Suppers in the Biblical sense. What else could they be? After Gurd jieff' s death, Schaeffer became a Catholic. He later confessed that he could never go to Mass without thinking of Gurdjieff. \"Had he not invited me to the last hours in the Upper Room?\" He laments: \"Last Suppers, alas, are always among the last moments of the Masters, they will be their memoria ls. \" As the remark implies, Gurdjieff was moving on to an ecclesiastical plane. There were so many people: former Ouspenskians, former Oragean s, those who had known Gurdjieff personally or through his disciples, pupils of J. G. Bennett whose connection with the Work was more peripher al. Whether or not Gurdjieff wished it to happe n, they formed what one commentator has .�led a \"spir itual empire .\" The lone adventurer of the Hima layas , \"the tiger of Turke stan, \" was a long way away . Now there was an old man, a Man of Power, who inspired both terror and affection and controlled the allegiance of a sizable number of people. It seemed that the emper or was taking steps to consolidate his dominions and th at he intended to leave behind him some organization to perpetuate his teaching. After the war Gurdjieff made at least two plans to establish himself in large houses in the country: once in a vast nineteenth-century �Mteau and once in a disused hotel on the Seine. His pupils remain doubtf ul how seriously he intended these projects to be taken; perha ps, like the chores at the Prieure, they were merely an excuse for \"wor k.\" Gurd jieff also decided to publish Beelzebub's Tales . When F. S. Pinder asked the Master why he intended to issue a work whic h-fo r all the repeated revisions -was still riddled with mistakes, Gurdjieff replied that it was a \"rough diamond .\" \"Now necessary to publish. \" He was slowing up perceptibly.

Why must he go on doing it? Why do they let him? We should go home, we should not ask this tired man fo r anyt hing. ,,, Another acci dent took place . Gurd jieff's car was rammed by a drunken driver. Bennett saw him return home afterward and thought he had seen a corpse walking. Gurd jieff had fr actured ribs, had cut and bruised himself severely, and had sustained dangerous internal injuries. Despite his doctor's orders and in danger of death from countless different causes, he held a dinner that night as usual, telling his pupils that he must fo rce his body to walk. For several days he was very ill, but continued to lever his battered frame into the dining room and play host. Gradually his bruises fad ed, and he was cured. The words of one fo llower- \"cured hims elf'--do not seem too wide of the mark fo r this occasi on. \"His recovery was so complete ,\" Dorothy Caruso write s, \"that he looked younger after the accident than before . . .\" The mishap did seem to reinf orce what ever resolutions he had made about the future, fo r three or fo ur days afterward, he summoned Bennett and directed him to bring as many pupils as he could to see him in Pari s. A fr esh influx began . Bennett brought some sixty of his pupils during the summer of 1948, and weekend visits to Paris became the rule fo r him and his wife. Bennett's role in events was becoming crucial, fo r a variety of reaso ns. He was availa ble, devoted to Gurdj ieff, and possessed of extraor­ dinary energi es. In England he had an established center at Coombe Sprin gs-a body of pupils as extensive as any Ouspensky had ever command ed-and the organizational abilitie s which went with so large an underta king. If C. S. Nott is to be believed, Gur dj ieff told him that Bennett was \"useful for money\" but that the majority of his pupils would be useless fo r the purposes he had in mind. Gurdjieff might have had many different reasons fo r making this statement, but to take the cynical view, he might also have seen Bennett as a link with those who had been taught in the very different manner of Ouspensky. Such a conjunction was certainly in his mind, and he had even instituted readings from the typescript of In Search of the Miraculous as a change from Beelzebub's Tales . In the summer of 1949 Bennett was at a meal in the Rue des Colonels Renard, when Gurdjieff began to talk to him \"in rather a low voice\" about the role of Judas at the Last Supper. He reminded Bennett of his teac hing about Judas and asked him if he agreed. Bennett replied that he thought Gurd jieff was right. \"I am pleased that you understand ,\" said Gurdji eff; and in answer to another pupil who asked him to repeat what he had said, he returned: \"I speak only for him .\" Bennett calls Gurdjieff\" s words \"enigma­ tic,\" but it is clear that they had great signif icance 'for him; and elsewhere \""},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"THE LAST SUPPERS 473 he commends the role of \"Judases\" in general. They are the \"near-heretics\" who make the work of their masters live. This is worth bearing in mind when considering the history of the Work after Gurd jieff's death . On October 30, 1948, Gurd jieff sailed fo r America once more. His pupils had to bring very high-level pressure to bear on the French authorities before they would grant him a reentry permit, and there may also have been difficulties about landing in New York. Once there, Gurdjieff ensconced himself in the Wellington Hotel and resumed his American rout ine. The meals in the hotel, the sessions in various Childs Restaura nts, and the visits to the baths in the company of the men unrolled as before. Gurd jieff scandalized devoted Ouspensk ians by his apparently ungratef ul attitude toward their teacher who he said had \"perished like a dog.\" Others again were prepared to be terrified by a man whom they knew simply by the reputation he had acquired during the early 1930s. Most were pleasantly surprised by the mellow Gurd jieff they encounter ed. During his visit, Gurd jieff addre ssed an appeal \"to all my present and fo rmer adepts\" on the subject of Beelzebub's Tales . He announced its fo rthco ming publication and asked all of those who fe lt that they had derived benefit fr om the study of his ideas to pay 100 pounds fo r a copy of the first printing. The appeal was written by Bennett, who claims that he was not aware of what he was writing and that the manner and vocabulary were completely alien to him. He concludes that he \"had been made the victim of one of those tricks of thought transf erence, or suggestion, that Gurd jieff loved to play.\" There were just over nine months of Gurd jieff's life to run. In the New Year he returned to France and resumed the fa miliar pattern of his 'e xiste nce. Hordes of pupils crowded into his flat, or took part in chaotic motor expeditions so like those of the 1920s that only Gurd jieff's age and corpulence betrayed the difference. All this time he continued his practice as a \"physician-hypnotist\" and the constant proce ssion of his patients was a familiar sight to those who visited him in his capacity of Master. Throughout the summer of 1949, Gurdjieff drove him self against what was clearly a mounting burden of pain. He grew thin and pale. To the question of a pupil about whether he would not go to Calif ornia fo r a rest­ \"the kind of question Gurd jieff never answer ed,\" says Dorothy Carus�he repl ied: \"Perhaps Calif ornia, perhaps furthe r.\" Those around him refused to accept the nature of his illne ss. He had w eathered so many storms that he seemed to be indestructibl e. Surely he would cure himself again?

In connection with Bennett's lecture s, Mme. de Salzmann Hew to London to give instructions in the movements. The response was gratifyingly large . Gurd jieff had been booked to leave for the United States on October twentieth, four days before Bennett delivered his last lecture. But, as in the case of Ouspensky on a very similar occasion, the sea voyage never took place . From what Gurd jieff said to fo llowers like Fritz Peters, it seems that he must have known fo r some time that death was approach ing. William Welch records an odd incident, about two weeks before Gurd jieff's death , when the Master drove to the Russian church in the Rue Daru with fo ur or five compan ions, and fo r an hour sat silently outside it. \"They remembered it only later and wondered about it when they fo und themselves in that same cathedral standing around his bier. \" Gurd jieff treated his doctors abominably, ignoring or refusing their advice . Eventually the newly qualified Dr. William Welch was sent fo r from America to take over fr om the corps of distinguished physicians who had been repulsed by the Master. Gurdjieff now seemed to have little will to live , and the doctor removed him without difficulty to the Americ � n Hospital at Neuilly. There he prepared to tap Gurd jieff's dropsy. \"Only if you not tired, Doctor ,\" the Master told him. Gurd jieff died at 11 A. M. on October 29, 1949. \"Do you want to die like a dog?\" he had thundered at his quivering pupils; and Pierre Schaeff er asserts that Gurd jieff's own death was fa r from the bestial fate he predicted fo r the ma..ss of mank ind. \"He didn't die like a dog, \" Schaeffer write s. \"In death he made a difficult, indefinable movement with his extraordinarily contorted muscl es.

Acco rding to Dr. William Welch, on the Thursday before his death Gurd jieff had summoned Mme. de Salzmann to his bedside and issued instructions fo r the continuation of his work . On the evening of the Master's burial in Avon-wh ere he lies between two great menhirs of undressed stone--she spoke to about fifty pupils and announced her program . She told them that a teacher of Gurd jieff's stature could never be replaced . Their one chance was to work toget her: to create the conditions which Gurd jieff had been able to man ufac ture by himsel f, but which could not now be engineered by a single person. J. G. Bennett had already been approached by French rebels aga inst her authority, and he knew full well the differences of opinion which divided both the English and the American followers of Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. \"Ha ving seen the friction between those who had been closest to Gurd jieff ,\" Bennett writes, \"1 could not but marvel at her optim ism; yet 1 was bound to agree that in unity lay our only hope .\" The Masters might be gone; but there were Mistresses to take their place .

It is known simply as \"the Work\" and has been able to bring mult ifarious points of view under a common umbrella. For example, atte mpts to bridge the gap between Maurice Nicoll and the orthodox Gurd jieffians had been made even before the doct or's death fr om cancer in 1953. This was important, because after the deaths of his own two teachers , Nicoll had increasingly come into the open. With a fo llowing of about six hundred people, a headquarters at Great Amwell House in Hertf ordshire, and some influence on the journalistic world, his support was significant . Volumes I-III of what eventually became Nicoll's five-vo lume Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of G. 1. Gurd jieff and P. D. Ouspensky was first privately printed in 1949. These were followed by his The New Man (1950), a volume of Gospel interpretations inspired by the psychoanalytical interpretation of dream s, and Living Time (1952), an extension of Ouspensky's time speculat ions with the aid of classical philosophy. The Commentaries received an enthusiastic endorsement from Mme. de Salzma nn, and fo r his part Nicoll was careful to deny that his own works had any authoritative nature . They were mere \"personal contributi ons.\" In view of their teacher's attitude it is not surprising that by 1960 Nicoll's successors had joined the Paris-oriented London Gurd jieff Society. On the other hand there were the bodies of opinion which would have nothing to do with Gurd jieff's successors and were mostly headed by Ouspensky's fo rmer pupils. There were the Society fo r the Study of Normal Man-f ounded in 1951 by the adherents of Dr. Francis Roles-the London­ based School of Economic Science; and by 1955 the supporters of J. G . . a ennett, who had seceded from the Paris-controlled groups. Some disciples in the Ouspe nskian line of succe ssion have wanted to preserve the teac hing as they received it from their Master -in their phrase , to \"keep the System pure\"-while others believe that Ousp ensky's exposition of Gurd jieff's jdeas had all along had \"som ething missin g.\" Still others have been inspired to add their own contribution to the Work ideas. It would be possible to write another entire book about the bewildering variety of quests on which the independent groups have embarked; and here it can only be said that these have embraced Greek Orthodoxy , Hinduism and the Whirling Dervishes, as well as resulting in a fo ur-volume survey of the whole human knowledge by Bennett and the introduction to the West of the Indonesian religion Subud and the Tran scendental Medi tation of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

But a halt must be made somewhere: although even a book which takes the deaths of Gurd jieff and Ouspen sky as its historical conclusion would be incomplete without at least one postscript indicating some of the directions in which it was possible to travel after the great men were gone. One of the most intriguing journe ys-incorporating within itself so many pos­ sibilitie s-was the personal odyssey of Rodney Collin. If any one of the disciples' spiritual journeys suggested ways of fa shioning harmony out of discor ds, it was this extraordinary pilgrimage . For Rodney Collin the time of Ouspensky's death remained the fo cal point in the history of the Work, the core of all meanings and the source of fu ture insp iration . Long afterward he still fo und himself \"looking back at all those years of Ouspensky's work between the wars as preparation­ preparation fo r something that was actually conceived in the end. . . .\" In November 1949, he had expressed the sense that all times and all possibilities were somehow contained in Ouspensky's passage fr om this world to another. Death, he wrote , was \"the greatest mystery, in which everything becomes possible, nothing is impossib le.\" The miracles surrounding Ouspensky's death had proved the quality of the event; and Collin had experienced his own personal miracle . When he had locked himself into the room where Ouspensky had died something had happened to him---or, more precisely, something came to him. I always disliked and still do dislike the idea of \"commun ications .\" For although such things are certainly possible from higher man they are inevitably understood wrongly, and immediately they are spoken about give rise to superstition in some and incredulity in others. And in due course the superstitious and the incredulous inevitably quarr el. But I have to tell you a story . Not long after Ouspensky's death I went to his bedroom and sat down there in a rather curious, superstitious mood. After a minute or two a voice in me-it could have been a memory of Ouspensky's voice-said with the chuckle which I also remember very well: \"You want a communication from the dead . Well, you won't get one!\" During his six days of isolation Rodney Collin clearly thought that he had receiv ed, if not a \"commu nicati on,\" at least some insight or information into the state of the universe. He moved into a flat in central London and completed a book he called The Theory of Eternal Life . This was based on the visions which had come to him during the six days at Lyne. It possesses the extremely brittle eoherence of many visionary"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"THE QUES T FOR HARMONY 479 works- like, for example Tertium Organum, with which it can be com­ pared. Some tremendous upheaval, some gigantic implosion of new meanings has transf ormed the author' s univer se, and suddenly everything he ever knew realigns itself to support his new vision of the wor ld. Like Tertium Organum, The Theory of Eternal Life can be frequently faulted where it tries to be most \"scien tific\"-a mistake in the first chapter ruins the supposed mathematical basis of the argument-but its author's intense conviction of the importance of his miracle provides -as it provides for Tertium Organum-a justification for the book. The Theory of Eternal Life in a sense was Rodney Collin's miracle, or a central part of it. The first edition was printed privately and issued anony mously in 1950. Collin could not be induced to put his name to it, as he maintained that he had no right to claim authorship. The unanticipated result was that The Theory of Eternal Life sold heavily on the basis of a rumor that it was by Ouspensky. Many people who knew Collin have asserted that he rose above his natural capaci ties to write this book, and the conclusion of The Theory of Eternal Li fe shows that he agreed. Referring to Ouspensky, he write s: \"Of his achieve ment then let this present book stand witne ss, written this year following his death, of knowledge undeser ved by me. Let him who can understand understand. For so it is.\" He begins The Theory of Eternal Life by dividing human life into nine periods, which he imagines to be relate d on a logarith mic scale. The ennea gram is clearly in the back of his mind. Each period of human life is used to develop a higher function: thus the period of gestation produces the physical body, the first seven years of life elaborate the personality , and maturity is the time when the soul should be developed. Then comes the first covert reference to Ouspensky's death : \"We have every reason to believe that the impact of ever higher energies at successive stages of life does not end at . . . the prime of life.\" The \"prime of life\" is the penultimate point on his scale; and the last point is death. At death-wh en according to Ouspensky the death agony merges with the ecstasy of conception for the next recurrence-the energy released is \"too intense to be contai ned within a body of cellular structure ,\" which naturally dissolv es. With these principles established, the author turns to religious and mythical writings. Traditional wisdom teaches that a period of time elapses between death and the allotting of a new body to the soul. St. Makary of Alexandria, The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and the Platonic myth of Er, all demonstrate that the soul does not immediately reincarnate . To discover what happens in the intervening time, Collin pro jects his logarit hmic scale into a diagram of what he calls \"the invisible world s,\" which had come to him during his vigil at Lyne. This diagram consists of four circles or rings interlinked as if a figure eight had been transfixed by the sign for infinit y­ or another figure eight at right angles to the first, joining it at the central"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"480 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE point. These fo ur circles represent the four possible world s. The first circle is the \"cellular\" world in which we live; its sibling on the lateral figure of eight is a world of higher energy, the \"molecular\" world ; above both soars the \"electronic\" world of extremely rarified matte r; and below everything at the bottom of the vertical figure eight lies a heavy, nearly inert world of mineral existence. In religious terms these worlds correspond to Earth , Purgatory , Heaven, and Hell. In the interval between death and birth, a man lives in the invisible worlds. The \"soul\" is born at the physical death of a man and serves as the vehicle of consciou sness in the molecular world , or Purgatory. Before death, some men develop a soul, which has \"the freedom of the Earth worl d\"; that is, it can pass through physical objects. Simil arly the \"spir it\" is the body or vehicle of consciou sness in the electronic world . The spirit is composed of a degree of matter equivalent to light and possessing similar freedoms; fo r example, travel in three dimensions. By projecting the logarithmic scale which governs his division of the visible life of man into different period s, Rodney Collin even arrives at the average lifetime of these more rarified bodies. \"Man's individuality ,\" he write s, \"which inhabits a physical body fo r 76 years , has previously inhabited a soul fo r one month and before that a spirit fo r fo rty minutes. And birth into that spirit was simul taneous with the death of the previous physical bod y.\" But entry to the electronic of Heaven-world presents such a shock to the individuality that most men awake fr om death only in the latter stages of their sojourn in the world which fo llows (the world of the soul, or Purgato ry). Apparently deriving his idea fr om Plato, Collin maintains that in Purgatory time is reversed. The originality of this conception staggers him. \"It is an idea of such powe r, intensity and far-reac hing effect that it could not be invented. It is too strong fo r human imaginati on, which of itself can only produce weak ideas, enervating though ts.\" In the world of Purgatory causes become effects. \"I create the kind of world in which I live . . . the murderer gives birth to the murdered man and is responsible fo r the latter's life .\" This unnerving prospect has been exploited in Philip K. Dick's science fiction novel, Counter-Clock World (1968) . Mem ory of the counter-clock experience , Collin thinks, would explain why the saviors of humanity fe el th�t they were responsible fo r all the- suffering and evil in the world, when from the opposite direction of time they appear to assimilate it. The Heaven -world stands above Earth and Purg atory-at right angles to all Time, outside Time and contemplating its flow . Beneath the worlds of Time lies Hell, the destination of degenerating souls, where Time flows slowly and interminably. Legends of the Last Judgment in fact repre sent the moment when a soul,"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"THE QUES T FOR HARMONY 481 having traveled through the invisible worlds, passes into a new physical body. The stumbling block to the whole argument is the absence of memory in the ordinary man, reborn man-a fact to which legends of the River Lethe refer. The probl em, as Rodney Collin saw it, is to develop memory so that it can survive the shock of the transition into the invisible worlds. First a man must \"develop the film\" of his own memories-a doctrine which the author derived through Ouspensky directly from Gurdjieff. \"Memo­ ries-of people, places, critical and trivial incident s-which are ordinarily evoked in him only by associati on, must be brought back sequentia lly and by will.\" A man must concentrate on every single event in his life: \"Particularly those which he is reluctant to recall .\" It is the unpleasant memories, the memories of mistakes and weakne sses, which will lead a man to remember the reasons for his embarras sments and failures, and therefore give him the possibility of change in the next recurre nce. This is linked to Ouspensky's teaching that every life has its \"cross -roads\": points where different courses of action can make or mar the life. The man desiring to change his next recurrence must clearly note these crossroads in his newly developed memory: Perhaps he may go back to the actual scene of some mistake or opportu nity, and striving with all his force to remember himself, endeavour to attach to some wall or tree engraved upon his memory the understanding which he wishes to transmit. He may tell himself that when he stands there in his next life the sight of this tree must remind him to remembe r. It will then be borne upon him that his only chance is to become conscious now. He will understand practically the principle that our only way of commun icating memory to another life is by the force of consciousness in this. And he will see that the purpose of acquiring consciousness in life, is to remain conscious through death . In the colossal task of maintaining the thread of consciousness through death, only the most severe measures are likely to succeed. Rodney Collin suggests that suffering provides the necessary fixative. Christ, Socrate s, Buddha, and the Tibetan yogi Milarepa all seemed to invite martyrdo m. This then was the explanation for the curious activities of Ouspensky's last days: they were a preparation fo r self-remembering through death . To Collin it seemed that if Ouspensky had been preparing for the conscious acquisition of spirit, he must also be helping his followers to acquire souls. This was an application of the principle which the Master had often repeated: in order to move up the ladder of being a man must put someone in his place. Everyone concerned is therefore \"moving up one\"-being"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"482 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE dragged up by the teache r's cosmic ascent. This complicated proce ss shatter s the world fixed in its normally unalterable recurr ence. It can take place only at the death of the teacher and-it is never clear precisely why, except that Ouspensky had thrown out the idea in the New Model -this requires the perf ormance of \"a tremendous cosmic drama\" in which \"the chief e vent will be the death of the produc er. \" Ouspensky's name is never mentioned. During one short section the Russian appears as \"a man I knew\"; but it is doubtf ul whether The Theory of Eternal Li fe would make sense to anyon e unaware that it sprang fully fledged from Ouspensky's deathbed. The stat ement that the drama which precedes \"transfiguration into the electronic world\" can only be organized telepathically, remains an additional extravagance if the reader does not know that telepathy was commonpl ace at Lyne in September 1947. Ref erences to the miraculous appearance of Christ after the Crucifixion seems to be gratuitous wonder-making-until we remember that Ouspensky was thought by some of his fo llowers to have appeared or at least made his presence fe lt after his death. Rodney Collin drew several conclusions fr om his continuing sense of the miracu lous. The first was that miracles oc curring after a transfiguration were a sign that the experiment had succ eeded . They were also designed as a final test fo r a teache r's disciples -to see whether they possessed sufficient fa ith to fo llow where the teacher led. The transfiguration had opened \"a crack through all levels of matter, \" through which \"f or all beings there now lies a way of escape which did not exist before .\" On these principles he proposed to organize the rest of his life . While her husband was writing, Janet C ollin-Smith had been standing guard over him, preventing him from being overwhelmed by visitors who sought in his newly discovered certainties an authority to replace that of Ouspensky. But he seemed to have little wish to teach, although at least one friend fe lt that he was \"going somewhere very fa st. \" In a letter of July 30, 1948, he wrote It is interesting ... that people say: \"Collin-Smith is teaching, will teach, won't teach. They don't understand that I am learning and this is the only way that I or anyone else can do so. I r�ember very clearly sitting with Ouspensky at Longchamps in New York sometime about 1942, I think, and asking why everything seemed to have come to a stop. He said: \"You fo rget ope thing; many people fo rget it-to learn more you have to teach .\" By the time this was writt en, Collin was in MexiCQ. In the drab period fo llowing the end of the war, many of Ouspenskv's fo rmer fo llowers"},{"pageNumber":486,"pageContent":"THE QUEST FOR HARMONY 483 considered emigra tion. There was rationing at home, a Labour Government which some of the better-off no doubt wished fe rvently to avoid, and after their teacher vanished, there seemed little reason to stay . Some emig rated to South Africa, others to the United States-where Mendham still held open its doors. Rodney Collin had grown to love Mexico during.his wartime stay in America, and after a period of indecision, he left with his family and a small number of fo llowers fo r Guadala jara, where The Theory of Eternal Life was finished in November 1948, and then moved into an old hacienda in Tlalpam on the outskirts of Mexico City. They rented a Hat in the center of Mexico City where meetings were held which attracted Mexicans and members of the local expatriate society . Their community at Tlalpam was joined by a few more disoriented Ouspenskians from England. Until 1954 Rodney Collin did his best to project the vision of a sacred drama and to take the role in it which he understood had been allotted to him. Underneath the part he was playing-and this was a role half­ deliberately conce ived on a grand theological scale-what was there? \"A very fine man,\" says one person who knew him. To a woman who knew both Nicoll and Ouspensky, Collin seemed \"the most lovable and the warmest of them all. He had charity to the tips of his fingers .\" He seems always to have fo und it easy to attract friends; yet until he met Ouspensky, he had no fixed center of gravity. From then on a great earne stness drove him. It may have driven him too fa r. There are critics who say that he eventually went mad . Another faction mainta ins that earlier in his life Rodney Collin had been a skillful hypnotist and accu sed him of using hypnotic powers on people \"in the Wor k.\" Tall, charming, and consider ate, the contours of his face particularly English, he seems the most unlikely figure to invest with the cloak of a Svengali; and the accusation is denied by those who knew him best. But outside the closed circle of \"Work\" values, divorced from the intensity of his private experience , what sen se does he make? The conc lusion is inevitable : only within the context of the role he envisaged fo r himself can he be understood. In the letters he wrote from Mexico to his numerous corre spondents, he et:llarged upon the theme of the miracu lous. Ouspensky had gon e in search of the miraculous and had enabled others to experience the miraculous for themselves. Just as Ouspensky's death was fo r him the key point in time, the state of mind he had experienced with some of the others at Lyne remained the key attitude to life. In one aspect he saw his mission as being to break down resist ance to the mirac ulous. In November 1951, he wrote : \"My own aim is to live permanently in this miraculou s atmosphere ; or at least permanently in the knowledge and memory of it. At such times it is less and less the need of personal work I fe el, and more and more the"},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"484 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE urgency of acting as a pure and understanding instrument in the realisation of a great plan.\" In July 1953, he used a metaphor which leaves no doubt of how he saw the situati on: \"All work fo r the creation of groups on earth is concerned with the building of arks to be navigated from a higher level. But my experience is that navigation may be fa r more exact and meaningful after the Teach er achieves and dies. For then he sees further and wider; yet his work must still be with the ark he made. . . . The difference is like navigating with a great capta in, and then navigati ng under the first mate with radio.\" Rodney Collin was content to be an instrument, and to encourage in others an app rehension of the realm of wonders he himself had con­ templated. The great energy released by Ouspensky's death could still give \"understanding and direction\" to those who had fe lt its effects. By June 1951, he had come to consider that \"the question of actual contact with Ouspensk y-through time or however it is- seems to be the key question, and no longer for a few lucky individuals but on a larger scale .\" His part of the Work could form part of a mys tical body connected with Ouspensky through the crack in matter which his death had opened up, and mainta ining its connection through the emotional support it gave to the teacher who had gone ahead . \"Those who believe in him become part of his work, and he in turn becomes responsible for them .\" The essent ial fo r this was what Ouspensky called \"positive attitude ;\" which is nothing more nor less than faith. Rodney Collin's advice to more orthodox Ouspen skians was in the uncompr omising terms of a fu ndamental­ ist, berating Doubting Thomas. To those who floundered about wailing that their teachers had been taken from them, he wrote in tones of in­ compreh ension. \"If we ever had a teacher we have one now. If we have not one now, did we ever have one?\" His answer to the more staid-those without \"positive attitude\" toward the fa cts of Ouspensky's death and who by implication questioned his own sanit y-a pplied both to the last days of his departed teacher and to his own condition at the time of writing: All that Ouspensky said and did at that time seemed to me to have exactly this purpose and effect-to sort out the people who could respond to the miraculous from those who could not. . . . It was very clear that if a man in a higher state of consc iousness acts directly from the perceptions of that state , . . . he will seem mad to men in an ordinary state . By July 24, 1953, his impatience with the custodians of inh er ited tradition had broken all bounds and he rebuked th� react ionaries who refused to take up the challenge of the new age :"},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"THE QUEST FOR HARMONY 485 It was put into out hands to be the agents of miracles. And we tell people to control the expre ssion of their negative emotions, not to push, and to form an orderly queue for an unknown bus, which may one day take them a twopenny stage nearer heaven. I wonder that a great voice doesn't come out of heaven thundering: \"0 ye of little faith!\" When will people understand that a new age has really dawned? When will they stop sealing up the terrible crack in heaven which Ouspensky has made with precautions and good behav iour? We must allow divine madness to take possession of us now, before hell freezes! With Rodney Collin's increasing emancipation from the letter of the law as Ouspensky preached it, the routine of the community at Tlalpam departed from the pattern of Lyne Place. Activity centered around an extraordinary project which originated in the visions experienced by its designer in the week after Ouspensky's death. This was for a \"three­ dimensional diagram\" to symbolize the laws governing universal harmony . In 1949 a field in the mountains outside Mexico City was bought, and work began on a building which became known as the Planetarium of Tetecala. Tetecala --meaning \"stone house of God\" -was the name of the field on which the building stood. The site was perched dramatically 9,000 feet above sea level, with a magnificent view over the valley in which Mexico City lay 2,000 feet below, and the design of the building was equally remarkabl e. The ground plan was based on two chambers hollowed from the lava rock on which the Planetarium was to stand. The larger area-­ fOrty-three feet in diameter -was named the Chamber of the Sun. Linked to it was the smaller Chamber of the Moon. \"Between the two in a small space ,\" Joyce Collin-Sm ith writes, \"a great upturned shell received the sun's rays through an aperture , at the Summer Solstice. Round the chamber ran a passage-way, .the walls of which were lined with mosaic designs drawn and laid by himself, depicting all levels of organic life, from the primordial to the perfect Man. Above ground, the planetarium itself was to have been Oanked by the library , and a room for Mexican dancing, lectures or theatre performances. \" The community at Tlalpam planned to build their own houses beside the Planeta rium. A clinic and dispensary were established for the local peons . The strange immigrant band began to integrate themselves with the life of the country. Rodney Collin established an English bookshop in Mexico City and made plans for marketing Mexican arts and crafts . He set up a publishing firm, Ediciones Sol, to issue his own books and Spanish translations of Ouspensky and Maurice Nicoll. He felt that he, the Work, and Mexico were all on the edge of a new beginning. On February 22, 1950, he wrote: \"It is very difficult to convey the strange springtime feeling"},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":".486 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE of certainty, of beginning from the beginning, of a new unspoiled start, which one gets in Mexico just now. Everything is growing, expan ding, developing . . .\" By abando ning the System, Ouspensky had set his fo llowers free to travel their own paths . \"The idea of reconstruction seems to be endl ess,\" Collin fe lt. \"It will be different for each person acco rding to his knowledge and capa city.\" The new beginning in Mexico was watch ed with some trepidation from the Old World. To some it seemed that by erecting the Planetar ium, Collin was embalming the Work in a stone coffi n. On the principle that there should be no permanent fo rms, no tangible monuments, no direct literary representations of the teachi ng, this was unanswera ble. Yet when the Collin-Smiths traveled to Eur ope in 1952-53, few voices were raised against them. Rodney Collin was invited by Maurice Nicoll to lecture at Great Amwell, and he remained in contact with Francis Roles and the more orthodox Ouspenskians. He also visited Paris whe re, through the Librairie Vega, he bought a large private library of occult books to be housed at the Planetari um. He took part in the work of the Paris groups ; and with the single exception of J. G. Bennett -with whom he appears to have quarreled-he was in contact with all the different strands of activity deriving fr om Gurdjieff or Ouspensky. His own task began to seem more and more a work harmonizing appare ntly conflicting points of view. Harmony! What to others appeared schism and dissension, seemed to Collin a necessary division of functi ons, the extension of a sphere of influence rath er than a proclamation of dogmatic \"teachi ng\"; the provision of many different but complement ary points of view. At first, with the memory of the apocalypse of Lyne upon him, his perception of the unity underlying all things had been expressed in terms of the union of Ouspensky's followers with their tran sfigured Master. As the impact of the experience faded with time, his sense of harmony seemed more and more to refer to the Work as a whole , to all the influences stemming from Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. This larger idea of harmony had in fact been born soon after Ouspensky's death . In August 1948, he had answered one inquirer that progress was necessary-b ut at the same time, that the growth of a living organ ism had been in the plan of the Work from the beginning. What he was doing was providing the theology to support the work of Mme. de Salzmann and Mme. Ouspensky in bringing the scattered groups together-although he saw more unity in diversity than other leaders of the Work. He set out deliberately to write scripture , revelati on, and commen­ tary all at once; and he found his inspiration in A New Model of the Universe . When Ouspensky refers in the New Model to \"the draJJla of Christ\"-the mystery play acted out on the stage of the world-he says that no one can now tell if any of the actors in that play stumbled over their lines"},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"THE QUES T FOR HARMONY 487 or missed their cues. All mistakes were corrected in the Gospels, which presented a perf ect picture so that the play should have its intended effect. As early as February 1949, Rodney Collin had committed himself to the task of ensuring that the drama of Ouspen sky was presented as flaw lessly as possible. I am sure that it is in some way an esoteric principle that records have to be \"made right .\" It is not a question of hiding mistakes or unpleasan tness or anything like that . But if someone in the play acts outside of chara cter, so to speak, the record has to correct it. The text of the play has to be more perf ect than the play itself. How this can be is practically impossible to say. The New Testam ent must be the perfect example: everything is right. Collin embodied his convictions in a pamphlet, The Herald of Harm ony, which Ediciones Sol published in 1954. With its title harking back to Herald of Coming Good, it proclai med that its author's allegiance was no longer simply Ouspenskian. The pamphlet made huge claims fo r the mis sion of Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. Each age had had a messen ger sent out by \"the Hier archy ,\" which Collin also called \"Great School .\" The last age was that of Christ with his mes sage of love; but that age had lacked the element of harm ony. Gurdjieff and Ouspen sky were the mes sengers of the Hierarchy fo r the new era, and their complement ary qualities fo rmed a polarity on which their work was based. The deaths of the two Masters still appeared of tran scendental signifi­ cance, although The Herald of Harmony was a little doubtf ul about that of Curd jieff who , \"joking up to heave n, escaped with but the slightest Singeing of his wings, a drift of unearthly music echoing in his trail .\" Both Gurd jieff and Ouspensky now took their places as spiritual influences on the coming age. The destiny envisaged fo r the Work was enormous. \"Its interde pendent parts-now single men, now groups-later must grow to nati ons, belief s, whole races and their destin y.\" It was to be the fe rtilizing agent fo r the whole new era. Everyt hing, as Rodney Collin had written in 1951, was \"part of a great and fo reseen plan.\" His oWn role in the plan was to proclaim harmony , and in carrying out this task, he claimed the same poetic autonomy as in the creation of the Planetar ium. As he wrote in the fo reword to his play Hellas -written in 194!;} and published the next year-\" So much was put into the fashionable jargon of our day-in scientific terms, with electronic matter fo r divinity, and nuclear fission for its attainment. But not everyone is at home with molecules, and those that are grow tired of them at times. So now we must return to legend, striving to reanimate a more attractive fo rm.\" He"},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"488 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE was dramatizing the mythical possibilities inherent in the historical situation ; and in his own activi ties in Mexico, he tried to keep alive the sense of the miraculous and the perception of harmony by activating the oldest of all harmonic myths: the relationship between man and the stars. In 1954 his long book, The Theory of Celestial Influence , was published in English. He regar ded The Theory of Eternal Life as a condensation of some ideas contained in the larger book, and The Theory of Celestial In fluence also had its roots in his visions at Lyne. Its author even saw it as the fulfillment of a pr omise made to him by Ouspensky on the first occas ion they had met privately in Gwyndwr Road. He had told the Master that he was a writer by nature and asked his advice about his journalistic career. Ouspensky's reply had been, \"'Better not get too involved. Later we may find something fo r you to writ e.'\" It was a rule that if one asked Ouspensky's advice , that advice had the fo rce of law, and Collin had written nothing fo r the next ten years. \"But in the end, \" he noted, \"0. kept his prom ise. And the outline of the present book was written in the two months imme diately bef ore his death ... as a direct result of what he was trying to achieve and show at that time.\" Written, Collin seems to have believed, under the direction of Ouspensky, The Theory of Celestial In fluence is an ambitious attempt to link the ideas of the System with the findings of science and to calculate the cycles which govern the workings of nature . But whereas Ouspensky had drawn Gurd jieff's Ra y of Creation as a diagram of various degrees of matte r , Collin was concerned not with degrees of matter expressed as \"all suns\" or \"all worl ds,\" but with the actual physical planets. He calculated the ·life of the solar system; c orrelated planetary cycles with the functions of the human organ ism; co ordinated cosmic factors with the rise and fa ll of civilizat ions; and in general, attempted to produce a contemporary version of the Renaissance philosophy of the harmony of the spher es. The world is one united organ ism, and man is a corpuscle in the world body. Such corpuscles are called \"cosmoses\": \"The possibility of self-evolution or self­ transcendence implies a very special plan and structure which some creatures have and others do not have . Thus man, who possesses the possibility of perf ecting and tran scending hims elf, can be called a cosmos, whereas a dog, whic h seems to be a finished experiment with no further possibilities, canno t.\" The deSignation can also apply to groups of men. Under normal conditi ons, man develops in response to influences created in the con­ ventional proce sses of nature. But these are much too slow to permit real grow th. The result is the appearance of \"schools of regeneration\" which stimulate natural proce sses to encourage quicker development. The\".ap­ pearance of such schools is governed by the 165-year cycle of Neptune. By <'.�"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"THE QUEST FOR HARMONY 489 calcu lating from 30 B.C. Rodney Collin arrives at various dates which can be associated with \"esoteric schools .\" Thus the builders of the Gothic cathedrals, who so interested Ouspensky, flourished circa 1125; and after a number of 165-year periods, the Rosicrucians appeared about the year 1620. Never stated, but always implied, is the most recent date on the cycle of Neptu ne: 1950. It is safe to imagine with what esoteric school this is associated . A true school , Rodney Collin write s, \"endeavors to simulate and in successful cases actually creates a cosm os.\" Members of the school act the parts which in the great body of the universe are take n, fo r exam ple, by the planets . In this replica of the cosmic dance the teach er is the Sun. The Theory of Celestial Influence is dedicated to Ouspensky: \"Magistro Meo, qui Sol fu it est et erit ... \"-Ouspensky, \"who was, is, and will be the Sun.\" In The Theory of Eternal Life , Rodney Collin argues that the world of the spirit is the world of electronic energy. In several places Collin elaborates on the role of the Sun. Most importantly he writes that although man can imagine an infinity of Absolute s, fo r all practical purposes, the Sun is God. The implicati ons are extraor dinary, especially in view of the astonishing dedication to Ouspensky, who was, is, and will be the Sun. It was Collin's personal truth and quite \"beyond argume nt.\" Whatever may be thought of his harmonious universe, it has a poetic consistency which, although less compelling than Ouspensky's, required a similar leap of the imagination to perceive and to sustain. But by 1954 something of his earlier frenzy was leaving Rodney Collin. The language of The Herald of Harmony is false, stilte d, and sugary, however real the convictions which inspired it. And, The Theory of Celestial Influence, although written years earlier, shows the gaps in Rodney Collin's armor, which could be ignored in the eccentric ecstasy of The Theory of Eternal Life. The longer work was written at high speed and is full of factual errors , but it is the nature of the mind behind it which is called into question. The book gives the impreSSion of a man striving, and failing, to be a polymath . \"He did not possess ,\" says one acquaintan ce, \"the intellect for what he was trying to do.\" Rodney Collin had a journalist's training and a large store of general know ledge: he had} among other jobs, worked on the research staff of the Daily Express Encyclopedia in 1934. But general knowledge does not produce gener ally convincing explanatio ns of the universe. Rodney Collin is more impressive in his theological context, as the man who could live in the miraculous and who wished to inspire others with his version of ha rmony. Miracles still pursued him through the last two years of his life. For example: one evening in 1954 or 1955 a companion was seated with him in his study. In amazement she saw his features dissolve and reform into an \"Orient al\" face. Then it became difficult for her to focus on the face at all,"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"490 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE and it seemed as if Rodney Collin were an old man with a fluffy white beard. \"It's only because I haven't shaved fo r some day s,\" he said. Then his face became that of Ouspensky before shifting rapidly through a succession of unfamiliar masks- some Oriental, some simply unknown. When Ouspensky's image appeared, his companion cried out, \"You are Ouspensky!\" \"Very likel y,\" was the calm reply . And again in a restaurant, the same companion noticed the same phenomenon. \"I can see a face again ,\" she said; it seemed to be Chinese. \"I think, Tibetan ,\" said Rodney Collin. The n: \"Don't be frightened, the curtain of time grows thin, that's all.\" But even in the realm of the mirac ulous, by 1954 something had failed; the batteries were running low. People began to speculate : had he lost his con nection , was he mixing the levels of experien ce? Even -had he begun to pretend? He had given up listening to his own voices and begun to rely on othe rs. Compared to what had gone before, he had walked from the Chamber of the Sun into that of the Moon. Among those who were attracted to the meetings in Mexico City were an Eng lishman and his Mexican wife. Mrs. D. was a spirit medium, and soon after her arrival in the community at Tlalpam, she began to bring through messages from Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. How are we to account fo r the fact that the navigator listens to her, unless his radio is not working? Mrs. D. was an impressive personality and a powerful medium. Her renderings from Gurd jieff and Ouspensky were acco mpanied by the appropriate manif estat ions; she would walk like a man, her face would seem to contort into the outline of Gurd jieff's or Ouspensky's, and her voice grew harsh and guttural, even rendering Ouspensky's famous chuckle . She had been known to exhibit the stigmata and, acco rding to some reports, could open the wounds \"at will .\" She had been brought up in the intense atmosphere of Mex ican Catholic ism, and it was to be expected that her messages would contain the flavor of authoritarian Christia nity. A whole mythology grew up from the stories told by her voic es, which supplemented Rodney Collin's interpretation of the mssion of Gurd jieff and Ouspensky. Behind the great Masters, and in some way supporting them, were a pair of early Christian saints-Cosmas and Damian, the medical saints who were the patrons of the Medici. Ouspensky, of cours e, was named \"Pyotr Dem ianovitch \" and it was rumored that the name of \"Cos mas\" was somehow associated with Gurdjieff. Behind St. Cosmas and St. Damian was a mysterious character called \"Ivan Ivanovitc h,\" who appeared at odd times in history, and inspired all Ouspensky's heroes -the \"Rome School ,\" Stevenson, Nietzsche, Gurdj ieff, and Ouspensky's grand- \""},{"pageNumber":494,"pageContent":"THE QUEST FOR HARMONY 491 mother -and eventually by some mystical subterfuge, turned out to be st. Luke himself. . . . In 1954 the house at Tlalpam was sold and the community dispersed into family units in Mexic o City, although the Planetarium remained the focus of their activity . A Christian note, pitched in an uncertain key, began to be heard in the publications of Ediciones Sol. In The Herald of Harmony, Rodney Collin claimed his harmonious gospel as the \"New Christianity .\" The same year, he published another pamphlet called The Christian Mystery, which included a \"Litany fo r the Ennea gram .\" Yet another pamphlet called The Pyramid of Fire was withdrawn after publicat ion. * An encounter with Catholici sm became inevitab le. In the summer of 1954 the Colli n-Smi ths, acco mpanied by Mrs. D., made an expedition to Europe. The voices traveled with them; and the little group was directed from country to country on a mysterious occult quest. \"We went looking fo r traces of schools in the past,\" Rodney Collin wrote, \". . . and in a way difficult to describe, one seems also to make a living connection through time back to those experim ents.\" The quest was not altoge ther successful. They visited Seville, where the voices told them to look fo r a particular text in a specific book in a certain library : but the book was not there. After Holy Week in Seville, they traveled through the Greek islands, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon , Persia, and Turkey before returning to Mexico through Rome, Paris, and London. \"Although we didn't fully understand this when we started ,\" Rodney Collin wrote the fo llowing year, \"it is now clear that this last trip was a journey in search of the Passion .\" For the voices had not entirely fa iled, although they were not to be relied on for the exact page references of esoteric scholarsh ip. The party had halted at Rome, and here Rodney Collin was received into the Catholic Church . It may be suspected that the voices-although they appeared to be indicating the Pyramids or the Mount of Olive s-had actually been whispering \"St. Peter's\" all along. On his return to Mexico, Rodney Collin fo und that many of his more educated followers had drifted away . He had to def end himself against charges of superstitious reliance on the voices of Mrs. D., and compared the lady 's mission to that of Joan of Arc. He also had to defend himself * A fate which met several of the Ediciones Sol pamphlets. The earliest to be withdrawn was supposed to have been written by Ouspensky, Notes on Saint John's Gospel . This was a manuscript discovered by Rodney Collin among Ouspensky's papers, but which was in fact the work of another pu p il whp had submitted it to him. Collin issued it believing it to be Ouspensky's work, but withdrew it when he discovered his mistake.

In October 1954, he issued what reads as a general statement on his conversi on: I realized many years ago that our work is not a substitute fo r religi on. It is a key to religion, as it is a key to art, science and all other sides of human life ... By temperament, inclination , study, and by the country in which I have to work, I became a Roman Catholic. I had already anticipated this several years ago.

A year later he reassured a correspondent that although he was now a Catholic he still belonged to the Fourth Way, and \"no one either in or out of the Church\" could persuade him of a contradictio n. But relations with the more orthodox followers of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky had by now become strain ed. Those who had earlier been prepared to extend an understanding tolerance now fe lt that he had lost his way. In South America, howeve r, his influence was widespread .

In Mexico itself, Collin:S joint activities with Mrs. D. entered the public eye, as they busied themselves in welfare work among the poor. At the Planetari um, movements wete taught and theatrical performances given-which significan tly, included Anouilh's play about St. Joan, The Lark-and Rodney Collin involved himself in a ceaseless round of activity. He was becoming increasingly simple and childlike . Some people see him as a Schweitzer-fig ure; others would say that he became increasingly suggestib le. He drove himself harder and hru;der, tiring himself by responding to every call upon his time; sleeping little , growing exhausted in the thin atmosphere after long expeditions through uninhabited country with little food or rest. One such walk lasted fo r several days during which he ate only a handful of ra isins.

The only new development during 1955 was a pervasive emphasis on the term \"Hi er­ archy .\" The expre ssion had appeared in The Herald of Harnwny, and in his letters of 1955 it became increasingly important as the bridge between the ideas of Ouspensky and the Catholic Church. It was \"the Hier archy\" which had sent Gurd jieff and Ouspensky to earth : There exists an invisible Hier archy of spirits who order and direct all the diff erent aspects of lif e on earth and humanity . That which Ouspensky calls the Inner Circle of Huma nity , that which the Church calls the Church Triumphant, that is what we call the Hier arc hy. The Hier archy consists in Our Lord Jesus Christ, the spirit and redeemer of our univer se, and all his conscious helpers, great and small .

He had fo und his own home in the Catholic Church , and his letters are almost fr ee of the complicated terms of the Syst em .

We might assume that he had emerged from the cavern into the light of common day-b ut during the autumn and winter of 1955, a fl:� sense of urgency appeared to strike him. Something was at last go ing to happe n, the new age was really going to dawn . On October 3, 1955, he wro te: \"I think we have come to a cross-roads on many diff erent sca les.

Rodney Collin remarked that he fe lt \"rather stra nge,\" and much to his wif e's surprise -fo r usually he had no truck with medicines -he took several doses of the corarn ine that had been prescribed to relieve the eff ects of altitude sickness. That afternoon he went out alone into the streets of Lima, where he discovered an orphan beggar boy named Modesto. The boy had a def ormed leg which ca used him to walk on the toes of his right fo ot: neverth eless, he acco mpanied Rodney Collin on a climb up to the huge statue of Christ which stands on the mountain overlooking the city. Here they prayed that Modesto might be healed. When Janet Collin-Smith emerged after the siesta hour, she fo und a crowd gathered outside a draper's shop where her husband was buying the boy clot hes. It appeared that, after the expedition up the mountain, the two had gone together to the public baths where, in a ritual of pUrific ati on, Rodney Collin had washed the beggar boy and dried him with his own shirt. In the street he spoke to the onlookers and told them that the boy was their responsibility . \"You must learn what is harmony, \" M told them, \"you must learn to look after each other; you must learn to give-to give .\" The predictable retort came fr om the crowd : \"That's all very well fo r you, you're ric h.\" Rodney Collin repli ed: \"Ever yone can give something. Everyone can give a prayer. Even if you can't give anything else, you can always give a smile; that doesn't cost an yth ing.\" Then he took the boy off to buy him shoes and fe ed him.

The morning's sightseeing went as planned, and the Collin-Smi ths returned to their hotel . During the siesta, Rodney Collin went out again as he had done the previous day. From various accounts which his wife and friends pieced together afterward, he seems to have gone straight to the cathedral to find Modesto in his belfry, ninety-eight steps above the cathedral square . He sat down on a ledge below the parapet, and began to tell Modesto how he was going to arrange for an operation to be carried out on his twisted leg. All the time he was talking, he kept his eyes fixed on the statue of Christ on the mountain opposite . Suddenly he stood up, gave a gasp, and lurched fo rward on to the top of the parapet, grasping with his hands the two beams which supported the arch above it. Then his head struck one of the beams, and he fe ll into the street below . An old woman who saw him fall said that he fe ll fe et foremost, his arms outstretched in the fo rm of a cross, and his head canted backward as if his gaze were still fixed upon the statue . He lay on the ground in a peculiar cruciform positi on, with his right leg drawn up just as the cripple boy's had been. He was smiling. \"It is not unusua l,\" Janet Collin-Smith remarks , \"for a man to die of a heart attack after climbing a long flight of steep stairs at such an altitude after weeks of physical etTort in a state of exhau stion. It is the natural consequence of physical conditi ons.

His death could have been an accid ent, act of God, or the grateful surrender of an exhausted spirit into his Savior's keeping. It could have been a death chosen in a ccordance with the theories of The Theory of Eternal Life: part of a mystery play, part of a process designed to fix his memories through the invisible worlds . Or, it could have been connected with his confession to his wif e that he had off ered his body in exchange for the health of the beggar boy. In November, the previous year, a correspondent had asked him about escaping from eternal recurren ce. He replied that this could only be done \"by sacrificing one's unicellular 'liberty' and becoming absorbed into a higher organism with a higher aim.\" He had alway s considered that the little human cosmos should join with a greater whole, and tried to live his life in a universal context.

Gurd jieff and Tradition There is a distinction between the fo rms and content of Gurd jieff's teaching�r to use the theological terms, \"subst ance\" and \"acciden ts.\" W hen Gurd jieff was actually engaged in teachi ng, the accidents may not have affected the subs tance of what he taug ht. But fo r anyone approaching his ideas in historical perspective, such acci dents are a stumbling block . Although he varied the fo rms within which he worked , Gurd jieff did make consistent use of an elaborate co:;molog ical scheme. This is expressed in the palate -shattering language of Beelzebub's Tales, but it is better known through Ouspensky's In Search of the Miraculous . Many people fa scinated by Gurd jieff approach him through this book. The result is that the cosmology which he taught to his groups in Holy Russia has become fixed in the imagination as an integral part of \"what Gurdjieff taught .\" Ouspensky was part.icularly interested in Gurd jieff' s theories on the cosmic relat ions; and successor teachers of the ideas have made use of the ennea gram , the Cosmic Octa ve, the Table of Hydroge ns, and the rest of the esoteric paraphernalia with which the name of Gurd jieff is associated . Gurd jieff \"remains one of the great enigmas of our time ,\" writes Prof essor Needleman. \"What sources did he draw on fo r his ideas, his music, and sacred danc es, his method of lne?\" Research into the sources of Gurd jieff's System has been going on ever since he arrived in the West, but 499"},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"500 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE very little has been published that is not deliberately misleading. J. G. Bennett writes that \"95% of what he taught can be fo und elsewhere ,\" and followers of Gurd jieff and Ouspensky must at least have traced the sources of the cosmology . Discovering the sources of the cosmology makes it much clearer what Gurdjieff was about, although we must beware of assuming that the cosmology alone is \"what Gurdjieff taught.\" In Glimpses of Truth Gurdjieff cautions the narrator against imagining that he would have expressed himself in occult terms to everyone who came his way: The fact of the matter is that in occult literature much that has been said is superfluous and untrue. You had better forget all this. All your researches in this area were a good exercise fo r your mind; therein lies their great value, but only there . They have not given you knowl­ edge .... Judge everything from the point of view of your common sense. Become the possessor of your own sound ideas and don't accept anything on faith; and when you, your self, by way of sound reasoning and argument, come to an unshakable persuasion, to a full understand­ ing of something, you will have achieved a certain degree of initiat ion. The details of Gurd jieff's cosmology belong primarily to the accidents of his teaching. Whether or not Gurd jieff himself took seriously his more occult ideas is another question. Any attempt to trace these ideas to their sources in occult tradition does show that Gurd jieff himself had read or studied deeply in such sourc es, or that he accepted the findings of people who had done so. When the cosmology recorc;led by Ouspensky is combined with various other hints dropped by Gurdjieff and what little we know of his life, a fairly accurate picture can be formed of the sources of Gurd jieff' s System. This suggests a surprisingly coherent and plausible interpretation of Gurd jieff's intellectual develo pment; although it is as well to remember that any particular fe ature of his teach ing may have come from friends who were more expert in certain subjects-Qr languages-than he. Although the game of origins is fascinating and informative , it at once becomes futile when it is used to argue that Gurd jieff derived his ideas from any one particular source . This is why, fo r exam ple, nothing will be said about the possibility that Gurdjieff took ideas froIJI any Sufi order, though certain Sufi methods-most notably the \"Stop\" exercise -were clearly important to him, and it is possible that several ideas which will be discussed in a European context-such as Cabala or nume rology-were first imbibed by Gurd jieff in an Islamic (that is to say Sufic) fo rm.

The essence of the"},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 501 concept is expressed in Gurd jieff's word, \"legominism\": knowledge trans­ mitted not by written instructions but by personal contact-too limiting to say by word of mouth-f rom generation to generati on. Very often there is a corollary to this: what might be called the theory of degeneration of knowle dge. In contrast with our normal ideas of acquiring knowledg e through the orderly progression of inquiry and experiment we associate with the scientific method, the Traditionalist holds that our real knowl­ edge-and our understanding of what knowledge we still possess -is steadily diminishing. The inheritors of Traditional wisdom are illuminated by the eternal flame of ancient knowledge which they guard fo r a time and then pass on. In this century there have been several attempts to make this idea respecta ble. Philosophers like Rene Guenon, students of religion like Mircea Eliade and Henri Corbin, and poets like Kathleen Raine have argued movingly for the transmission of knowledge within closed groups. On the other hand there have been countless cultists and occultists-what Gurdjieff called \"initiates of new fo rmat\"-w hose claims to possess Tradi­ tional wisdom are of the most doubtful nature . Some would place Gurdj ieff and Ouspensky in this categ ory. What is true is that twentieth-century Traditionalists-w hether phony or sincere-rely much more than they like to admit on the revival of occultism which took place during the last quarter of the nineteenth century . This phenomenon has been mentioned in connection with Gurd jieff's search fo r truth. The late Victorian occult revival drew the materials of its religious syntheses from sources beloved of Tradi tionalists throughout all Western history . In a sense the Victorian occultists were correct; their Traditions did represent a continuing line of knowledge which had remained rejected from the mainstream of European culture because of historical accident. * They sought inspiration in a perennial underground of \"re jected knowledge\" which has broken through the established culture of the West only at points of crisis. The turn of the century was one of these; another was that of the Renaissance and Reformation . The earliest detecta ble crisis in which the Traditions broke the surface was the period of some 400 years centered on the birth of Christ. This is the real canonical period of occult tradition . Oriental mystery religions were engulfing the Roman Empire; in Egypt the cult of Thrice-Great Hermes and the \"science\" of alche my arose; Gnostic prophets of every description vied with each other fo r a receptive audience .

Occult or Trad itional positions have their roots in the systems of thought which the Christian Church conquered . It would take too long to describe the common chara cteristics of these ideas . They often appear widely diverse, yet share some basic assumptions. The chief is that the soul or spirit is a spark of the divine entrapped in matter, and it is the business of the adept to exert himself by religious exerc ise and mystical practice to return his spirit to its divine condition (re-ligare, \"to reconnect\": compare the idea of yoga , signifying \"yoke \"). There is a great difference between recogn izing the existence of a continuous body of Trad itional wisdom and deciding that this means that such ideas must be true in an absolute sense. Occultists often make this assumption unquestioning ly-and there is a depressing tendency to incor­ porate every fragment of rejected knowledge into individual versions of Traditional wisdom. Gurdjieff -wi tness his remark about the time he wasted on H. P. Blava tsky's The Secret Doctrine-had as much trouble as any other inquirer in sifting the grain from the chaff. Nonetheless, he began with the Traditions, the supposed repositories of that \"secret knowledge\" to which he turned when disillusioned with both religion and science . There are theref ore three main periods of history to be examined for parallel doctrines: the three known periods when occult ideas burst through from underground to influence the established culture of the West. 2. Mystical Mathematics \"All things began in order, so shall they end, and so shall they begin again, according to the ordainer of order and the mystical mathematics of the city of heaven .\" In The Garckn of Cyrus (1658), Sir Thomas Browne was expressing the vision of the universe common to modern Traditionalists and to all sections of educated opinion-both orthodox and heretical-in the prescientific age. Number was not seen just as the means of performing mathematical calcu lations but as a reflection of the divine ordering of the universe. The number 1 was not the mere integer but the Monad itself, the primordial unity which existed before, around, and through the diversifica­ tion of things. The tradition of regar ding the universe as composed of numbers is known as arithmology, and fo r the English-speaking reader the best exposition of the arithmological point of view is Theoretic Arithmetic published in 1816 by Thomas Taylor, the Platonist. Taylor made a digest from the more famous classical arithmolog ists, and gave his explanations a Platonic cast. He saw the basis of the \"Pythagorean\" position in the separation of the One from the Many in the world of form. \"The Pythagor eans, turning from the"},{"pageNumber":506,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 503 vulgar paths and delivering their philosophy in secret to those alone who were worthy to receive it, exhibited it to others through mathematical names. Hence they called fo rms, numbers, as things which are first separated fr om impartible union; fo r natures which are above fo rms, are also above separation .\" From the very first the tradition of mystical mathematics was closely bound up with the philosophical sources of Traditional doctr ine: the Platon ists, Neo-P latonists, and rank Gnostics of the first and second centuries A. D. The mysterious Pythagoras was the fa ther of a long tradition of number symbol ism. According to legend, he tra veled in the East-perhaps to the fu rther Orient, perhaps to the sanctuaries of Egypt -before fo unding his community at Crotona in Italy in the sixth century B.C. From Pythagoras one tradition of mystical mathematics passed through Plato and the fam ous calc ulations in the Timaeus into Judaism by way of Philo Judaeus and into Christianity through St. Augustine. Between the first and the fifth centuries A. D., the Pythagorean tradition influenced various schools of thoug ht. One of the most occult writers on number was Nicomacus of Gerassa (c. A.D. 1(0), author of a work entitled Theologumena Arithmetica . The arithmological view of number sees meaning and not use in number. There are obvious paral lels with Gurd jieff's usage. For exam ple, the doctrine that three fo rces must be present to fo rm any given phenomenon is an arithmological comm onplace . The \"octave\" of the Ray of Creation derives directly from Pythagoras . Gurd jieff' s diagram of the relati onships of different subst ances in the universe was expressed in terms of \"triads\" of forces-ca rbon, nitroge n, and oxygen blending to fo rm a given subs tance : the hydrog en. Arithmologists of a Gnostic or Neo- Platonic bent used the same symbol ism. From the Mona d-the Absolute in Gurd jieff's terms­ emanated various divine \"hypostas es\" or forces, which in combination produced other fo rces and so on into diversity, with each successive emanation passing fu rther away fr om the Sour ce-or, if you prefer it, descending the Ray of Creation. Gu rdjieff used arithmology to support his idea of a hierarchy of being: in one aspect this is what he meant with his Ray of Creation and the Table of Hydrogens. In the Theologumena of Nicomacus will be found a table of the numbers fr om 1 to 10 considered as various grades of being. We are approaching Gurd jieff's presen tation of Traditional wisdom from the point of view of number. But Traditional ideas are so widely diffused that Gurd jieff's use of them could be compared first of all to the philosophical position of, say, Plato, Proc lus, or Plotinus-all of whom made some use of arithmological argu ment. Gurd jieff was never primarily an arithmologist; however, a general philosophical position is less easily identified than a particular attitude to number. One final example may"},{"pageNumber":507,"pageContent":"504 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE make dear how Gurd jieff used his Traditional sources. This is a lecture on symbolism recorded by Ouspensky in In Search of the Miraculous which Gurd jieff also delivered in the days of the Institute fo r the Harmonious Development of Man. Ouspensky illustrates his record with pictorial symbols of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These are a pair of straight lines, a triangl e, a square, a pentagram (five-pointed star), and a hexagram (six-pointed star or Solomon's Seal). In other words, the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are being considered arithmologically and not arithmetica lly: the symbols represent not the arithmetical numbers, but the arithmological ideas of duad, triad, quater­ nity, pentad, and hexad . Gurd jieff's interpretation of the progression from duad to hexad was an allegory of human develo pment. Normally man is a duality, consisting entirely of pairs of opposites. When he begins to recogn ize that his nature consists of mechanically conflicti ng impulses, he may set himself the conscious aim of overcoming them . \"The creation of a permanent third principle in man is for man the transformation of the duality into the trinity .\" A strengthening and application of this conscious resolution results in the trinity becoming the quate rnity. The next transformation- from quaternity to quinternity--enta ils the construction of the pentagram ; and Gurd jieff interprets this as the proper activa tion of all five lower centers. Once man achieves such harmony he is in conta ct with higher conscio usness. The symbolic result is that he proceeds from pentagram to hexagram : And then man becom es the six-pointed star, that is, by becoming locked within a circle of life independent and complete in itself, he becomes isolated from foreign influences or accidental shocks ; he embodies in himself the Seal of Solom on. This interpretation is, of course, Gurd jieff's alone, and it is made in accordance with his ideas about human develo pment. But to show how he had framed his conclusions in accordance with Traditional doctrine, it is useful to compare what Nicomacus of Gerassa has to say about the hexad and the development of man in a passage from the Theologu mena: In another way soul is capable of articulating and arranging body in the same gener al way that psychic form is capable of doing so to formless matte r; and in general no number is more able to fit the soul than the hexad ; no other would be called so much an articulation of the universe set up as maker of soul and discovered also capable of instilling the condition of life, whence it is called \"hexa d.\" That every soul is a harmonising element . . . is evident; fo r when it is present it makes"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTE M 505 peace, and orders well and fits best together the mingled opposites in the living thing, which yield and fo llow it, and it instills in this way health into the combination ... The most important use which Gurd jieff made of number symbolism is the figure of the ennea gram , which he said contained and symbolized his whole Syst em. His ennea gram consists of a circle with the circumf erence divided into nine points which are joined to give a triangle and an irregular six-sided figure . Gurdjieff said that the triangle repre sented the presence of higher fo rces and that the six-sided figure stood fo r man. He also claimed that the ennea gram was exc lusive to his teac hing. ''This symbol cannot be met with anywhere in the study of 'occult is m,' either in books or in oral tran smission ,\" Ouspensky reports him as saying. \"It was given such significance by those who knew, that they considered it necessary to keep the knowledge of it secret .\" Not only did the enneagram express what Gurdjieff taught, but he claimed it as the final arbiter of esoteric knowledge : two men could decide by drawing the ennea gram which was the master and which the pupil. Because of the emphasis which Gurd jieff placed on this diag ram, his fo llowers have sought high and low fo r the symbol in occult literature . Bennett claims that it can not be fo und anyw here; and if disciples of Gurd jieff have in fa ct discovered the figure, they have kept it very quiet. But Gurd jieff himself was denying the truth of the matter when he said that the enneagram could not be fo und in occult literature . Representations­ although not as Gurd jieff drew it ---can be fo und, and the figure would be quit� well known to anyone who had bothered to study arit hmology. The trad itions of classical arithmology survived through the Mi ddle Ages in various fo rms. The work of Boethius (early sixth century) was much tran slated, and fr om this source as well as the Christianized versions of arithmology, ideas of the significance of number passed into common usage . When the men of the Renaissance enthus iastically rediscovered their classical inheritance, those of a mystical bent pounced eagerly on Neo­ Plat onism, Hermetism, and the Cabala to justify their transcendental impulses. The arithmological tradition was resurrected beside the other aspects of \"divine philosophy\" beloved by thinkers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuri es.

His Egyptology was overlaid with the customary reverence fo r the Cabala and Thrice-Great Hermes: and the whole had a further gloss of submission to the General of his Order and the Pope. It would be fair to describe him as presenting esoteric traditions in a Christian guise. In the Arithmolog ia, there is a figure called an \"enneagram \" composed of three equilateral triang les. At the apex of the triangle which corresponds to the completed triangular figure in Gurd jieff' s ennea gram-wh ere Gurdjieff places the do of his octave and the number 9-Kircher has the Greek inscription: \"hier arch.\" Within the symbol there is a smaller equila teral triangle. 9do Kircher's explanation of \"the mysteries of the ennead\" is similar to that of Thomas Taylor. The number 3 is particularly sacred (\"The Holy Tri­ amazikam no\"), and the 9 trebly so.

The Triune Monad, symbolised by an equilateral triang le, flows by differentiation into the intellectual world, which consists of nine choirs of angels in three degree s, represented by the same number of imaginary equila teral triangles connecting them; these instill them­ selves through the intellectual or angelic world into the astral world and thence into the elements in a miraculous and ineffable fashion. For all things are constructed according to the three catego ries of number, weight and measure, according to the creative wisdom of the Three -in­ One. The Jewish , Greek and Arab Sages of Antiquity sniffed out the mystery, and were of the opinion that they could explain the construction of both the intellectual and the physical world in no better fashion than by abstract numer ical arguments of this sort. Kircher ends his description-and his book- with an attempt to derive Scriptural support fo r his arithmological universe. And in case it is thought that his reference to the Sages of Antiquity is intended in a scathing as opposed to a complimentary light, his valediction leaves no doubt that he felt himself to be revealing hidden doctr ine. It is italicized, as is the description of the Triadic universe-but not his pious reference to Scripture . \"And I have exposed to the curious reader things which are told to fe w. Farewell, and guard your tongue .\" In fact Kircher's description covers only the early stages of what Gurd jieff would call the Ray of Creati on, and he no doubt assumed that the rest of his emblem would be understood by an audience alert to every esoteric allusion. The Monad, which is also the Holy Trinity, is represented by the eye in the triangle at the center of the enneagram . The \"nine choirs of angels\" are joined in three degrees of trinities by triangles of fire.

There are many other represent ations of the Neo-P latonic cosmology of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but Kircher's has been neglected . We have by no means done with his fiery enne agram or the hurtling spheres of his astral world. The most obvious question is: if this is the figure known to Tradition as an \"ennea gram ,\" why is Gurd jieff's different and what might this signify? 3. The Hamwnious Univer se pythagoras is the source of a number of other ideas associated with arithmology which have particular relevance to Gurdjieff. All theories of \"objective art \" based on mathema tical canons of proportion can be derived from Pythagorean principl es, and there is little doubt that Gurd jieff's conception of art came from the same ultimate source as his numer ology . Pythagoras is supposed to have invented music to cure physical illness and what lamblichus calls \"the passions of the soul.\" Both in his writings and in his life, Gurd jieff gave ample proof that his own conception of \"objective music\" was Pythagorean. In Meetings with Remarkable Men he discusses the effects of music on human beings and other living objects. The companions of the Seekers fo r Truth were almost reduced to tears, he writes, by the monotonoUs musie played in one particular monastery. These musical investi gations-which are all concerned with the effects of music on the human psyche-reveal Gurd jieff to have known a fair amount of musical history. No one knows where Pythagoras fo und his musical ideas . Scholars have guessed at both Babylon and Egypt. His theory was based on the discovery of the monocho rd-to which Gurd jieff refers in Beelzebub's Tales . The Pythagorean monochord was a single string stretched like the string on any modem stringed instrument and divided by seven frets. It was fo und that when the string was plucked and held at different frets to produce a musical note, the vibrations of the monochord increased or decreased in a precise mathematical ratio. From this discovery the Pythagoreans ,deduced far­ ranging theorie �. The universe was thought of as a harmony composed of such vibratio ns. The sort of cosmos which Athanasius Kircher depicted was essen tially harmonious as well as arithmological; for number expressed the nature of the celestial harmony which governed and maintained all things. The"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"510 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE tradition of musical analogy went hand in hand with that of arith mology . From Plato the argu ments spread throughout the Med iterran ean, collecting certain additions and alterations on the way. Proclus had the idea of simplifying the calculat ions of musical intervals by elim inating fractions. He therefore replaced the numbers from 1 to 7, which Plato had used to mark the divisions of the octave , with a scale whose highest number was 384. When the number 384 is divided into proportions corresponding to the ratio of vibrations which relates the notes in the octa ve, the resulting scale expre sses their rela tionship in whole numbers. If this reform is compared with the Table of Hydrogens recorded by Ouspensky, Gurdj ieff can be discovered perf orming a simi larly useful simpl ificat ion. Throughout the Middle Ages the idea of the harmony of the spheres was preserved and acco mmodated to a Christian universe. The various grades of angels-Serap him, Cherubim, Thro nes, Dominations, Principa lities, Pow ers, and Virtue s-f ormed a descending octave from divinity, while the heavenly spheres of the planets could be manipulated into order, perhaps by assigning a special status to the moon and repre senting the earth as the silence after the echo has died away . Like the tradition of arithmology, the harmonial view of the universe came into its own in the crisis of Renaissance and Reformation. Francesco Giorgi-a canon ist so eminent that Henr y VIII wished to consult him about his divorce- published in 1525 the work De Hamwnia Mundi which served as an underground influence on many of the thinkers of his time. De Hamwnia Mundi is written in three \"song s,\" each divided into eight \"not es.\" The very first note discusses the Pythagorean view of the connection between number, music, and the symbolic interpretation of the universe. The ancients, writes Giorgi, spoke enigmatically in parables. The universal harmony is \"the concert of all strings in pure measures with no discords .\" But disharmonies have crept into this cosmic plan, and remain a puzzle for philosophe rs. In De Hamwnia are to be found all the essentials of Pythagorean world view, distilled fr om the arith mologish, the Plat onists and Neo-Pl aton ists, and spiced with Cabala. Countless exam ples show how the philosophy elaborated by Giorgi is the source of Gurd jieff's cosmology . This does not mean that he had read the book; fo r the influence of De Hamwnia Mundi seenls to have been grea test indirectly, as the source fo r the late Renaissance harmonial philosophy . Francesco Giorgi incorporated his Pythagorean views into a deeply orthodox Christian piety; but . others whom he influenced showed less respect fo r the Church . Among these were the Rosicrucians with whom Gurd jieff was certainly familiar and in whom the doctrines of De Hamwnia were widely diffused.

Research in the British Museum soon brought them to Robert Fludd, the eccentric English mystic whose great work, Utriusque Cosmii Historia (1617 -24) , contains among other things two representations of the \"mono­ chord of the world .\" Apart from the fa ct that Fludd specifically denied being a Rosicrucian, he did acknowledge his debt to Giorgi . Between 1619 and 1622, he became involved in two controv ersies with opponents who denounced his use of the octave as absurd mystificati on. One was the astron omer, Johannes Kepler, who was trying to show that the plane ts-the physical, astronomical planets-m oved acco rding to the principles of harmony. * Another was the French monk, Marin Mersenne, who, although a devotee of Giorgi, was concerned to purge Fludd's ideas of their magical accr etio ns. It is typical of some latter-day Ouspenskians that they have pounced on the most occult and eccentric use of a well-known idea. Although Athan asius Kircher does not acknowledge Giorgi as a source fo r his Arithmolog ia, there can be little doubt that he borrowed extensively from his predece ssor. From De Hamwnia, Kircher's universe , dominated by the Triple Ternary of the enneagr am, receives a fuller explana tion: we learn that the first triad produces the ang els, the second the heaven s, and the third the fo ur elements . On the authority of Plato , Giorgi maintains that the octave can be used to scrutinize the human soul; fo r as man is constructed as an image of the greater world, the same laws apply to him as to the cosmos. De Hamwnia argues the true Tra ditional position on the return of the spirit to its divine source . \"Just as the Supreme Creator descends into us by the stairway of the angels . . . so we may return up . them to that fr om which we came .\" Kircher's experiments into the eff ects of sound on matter went further than any of his predecessors in arguing that the universe was based not only on number and harmony, but on sound itself. In his Musurgia Universalis (1622), he discusse� the monochord, the question of interval s, and the eff ects of sound on matter and mind. In 1673 he published a work under the title of Phonurgia Nova, which defines the science of \"phonurgy\" as that of \"miraculous fa culties working by means of sound s.\" Apart fr om a predicta­ ble interest in the fa ll of Jericho, Kircher is chiefly concerned with musical medici ne. He maintains that music can cure werewolves and madmen and gives a musical cure fo r a tarantula bite. There is no doubt that Gurd jieff made thorough researches into musical literature, and although he might have picked up the principles of Pythagorean harmollY from the classical texts, the version which he • In the course of this, he drew diagrams based on the division of the circle resulting from the inscribed regular polyg ons. These diagrams have also been found suggestive by followers of Curdjieff. As far as the enneagram goes, Kepler made no use of it, as it did not fit his theory."},{"pageNumber":515,"pageContent":"512 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE expounded quite definitely derives from the revival and adaptation of that philosophy in the late Renaissance. The portable organ , like Gurd jieff's own but with an assembly of pipes, was known to both Fludd and Mersenne; while many of the miracles which Gurdjieff attributed to \"Essene\" music are discussed by Kircher. It is much more likely that the teacher of an \"esoteric Christianity\" would have taken his version of the harmonial philosophy from the more orthodox writers and practically certain that Gurd jieff's interest in the effect of sound on matte r would have led him to Kircher. What of the enneagram-the blazing Triple Ternary that dominates the frontispiece to the Arithmologia of that learned Jesuit? Kircher's universe is govern ed-as Gurd jieff would have said-by the Law of Three. From the intellectual world the astral world depends -and such is the engraver's skill that it seems to spin in the emanations from the ennead. But this cosmos is governed not by number only, but also by harmony and sound. Francesco Giorgi had admitted that there were inexplicable discords in the universal harmony. But surely the true canon of proportion according to Pythagoras excluded any varia tion? Gurdjieff, the twentieth century Pythag orean, had his answer: \"intentional inexactitud es.\" The members of his society of the \"Adherents of the Leg ominism\" -in other words, Trad itionalist s-.::...had introduced into their works of art deliberate variations from the proportions which would have given perfect harmony. But the universe of the Arithmologia is a perfect universe and Kircher's ennea gram is composed of three self-contained triangles linking heavenly choirs belonging to the same angelic orders. If a circle is drawn through the points of the enne agram , it will be seen that Gurd jieff's symbol uses the same divisions of the circle as Kircher: but that the two nethermost triangles have been opened out, and the lines which in Kircher's diagram join points 6 to 5 and 8 to 9, now join 6 to 9 and 8 to 5. Is this an \"inten tional inexactit ude\"? According to Ouspensky, Gurd jieff called his enneagram \"an incomplete and theoretical form.\" Perhaps he hoped that his pupils would themselves be able to complete the symbol and"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"THE SOURCE S OF THE SYSTEM 513 restore the original harmony. He interpreted the hexagonal figure in his diagram as representing man, and the triangle as standing for the external principles: the completion of the ennea gram could well have been intended as signifying the union of man with the div ine. Gurdjieff also called his symbol \"a moving diagram ,\" and based at least one of his dances on it. In Kircher's enneagram, \"motion\" is possible only within each triangle, but in Gurd jieff's, the six-sided figure allows continuous motion by reason of its isolation from the triangle in the center. Perhaps when the discords in creation-which so troubled the Renaissance Pythagoreans-were healed by a complete conformity with the divine plan, the motion of humanity would cease to be isolated from the working of the eternal principles within it. Whate ver Gurd jieff's intention in adapting the ennea gram to his own synthes is, or even whether he inadvertently destroyed its original signifi­ cance , it seems clear that the fu nction of the ennea gram is linked closely to another esoteric diagr am: the Caba listic Tree of Lif e. 4. The Tree of Life and the Art of Ramon Lull In Meetings with Rema rkable Men, Gurd jieff introduces his imaginary \"Sarmoun Brotherhood\" with the remark that he and his friend \"Pogossian\" had discovered the name in \"the book called Merkhavat .\" If this refers to anything, it points to the Merkhabah texts of Jewish mysticism, which were the fo rerunners of medieval and Renaissance Caba lism. The Merkhabah mystics based their practices on an attempt to attain a vision of the throne of God which is described in the first chapter of Ezekiel; more accurate ly, they aspired to a vision of the \"throne-world\" which Professor Gerschom Scholem equates with the Gnostic pleroma with its various potencies and powers. Scholem suggests that there was considerable contact between Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian Gnostics; and there is little doubt that the universe of the Jewish \"Descenders to the Throne\" would have been easily recognized by the mystics of the first few centuries A. D.-or by their succe ssors of the Renaissance . Although Cabalists claim to find their traditions in the Mosaic books, the text on which later Cabalists have mostly relied is called the Sepher Yetzirah or Book of Creation. This was elaborated by another text, the Sepher Ha-Zohar or Book of Splendor, written in thirteenth century Spain. These developed the ideas inherent in Mer khabah mysticism to the point at which they could be expressed in one e l aborate but comprehensive symbol, known in the W est as the Tree of Life. This is a diagram-as the title, \"Book of Creati on,\" makes clear-of the descent of divinity from the Godhead to Earth: what Gurdjieff called the Ray of Creation and the process from which Kircher symbolized in his engraving in the"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"514 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Arithmologia . But the Tree of Lif e is a much more complex hieroglyph than the Ray of Creati on. It also symbolizes the attributes of divinity and the fo rces which in combination fo rm the universe. These elements of creation are called the Sephiroth (singular, Sephir ah) and they fo rm the symbolic \"leaves\" on the Tree of Life . Conventionally they are represented by nine or ten circles arranged in a particular patt ern and joined by twenty-two \"paths.\" On one level the Tree of Lif e fo rm s a map by which the aspiring mystic can attain a knowledge of the whole of creation and ascend to the Godhead; on another, the symbol can be said to represent the interaction of the fo rces which produce phenomena. Each Sephirah is identified by a system of corr espondences or attributi ons which by their associatio ns suggest the nature of the fo rces which th e Sephirah conveys. Such a symbol corre sponds to other definitions which Gurd jieff gave to his enn eagram . It was \"perpetual motion\"-the Great Dance of the universe. It was \"the fundamen tal hieroglyph of a universal language , which has as many meanings as there are levels of men .\" Twice in In Search of the Miraculou s, Ouspensky records Gurd jieff talking of Cabala, and in his lecture about man's symbolic progres s fr om duality to the hexad, Gurd jieff added a very suggestive comment which was deleted fr om the published account. Afte r describing how his octave with its two shocks symbolized what Kircher would have called the Triple Ternary, Gurd jieff remarked that those of his audience who were fa miliar with the Cabala might compare the Cabalistic symbolism of ninef oldness. A rece nt book called simply Tree of Life, written by Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi, does not conceal its author's fam iliarity with the terms of the System as taught by Ouspensky. In the text and in several of his diagram s, Halevi atte mpts to correlate Gurd jieff's use of the terms triad, octa ve, and interval with the traditional interp retation of the Tree of Lif e . It is significant that a modern interpreter of jewish traditions has discovered similarities between his own atte mpts to r eformulate traditional doctrine and the presentation of ancient wisdom in new gui se made by Gu rdjieff. In the Arithmologia, Kircher was quite explicit that his enn eagram was equivale nt to the Hebrew Tree of Lif e, and the diagram of the Tree places some of the \"cor respondences\" which he lists as appropriate to each Sephirnh . It is impossible to explain the functioning of the Tree of Lif e in a fe w paragra phs. There is a vast literature on the sub ject. Above Kether, the Crown, are set three facets of Divinity. They may be compared to the divine triangle in the center of Kircher's ennea gram . Kether is the point at which divine energy enters the highest of the Cabalistic wor lds, and descends into the lower degrees of matter along a zigzag course which modern Cabalists call the Lightning Flash. The lowest point on the Tree is"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"The Tree of Life"},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"516 THE HA RMONIOUS CIRCLE Malkuth, the Kingdom, the highest concentration of matte r-to all intents and purposes the physical universe. Halevi's book uses the idea of the monochord stretching from heaven to earth, and he applies Gurd jieff's Law of the Octave with its two intervals to the descent of the divine energy into matter down the Lightning Flash. From our point of view, a reverse comparison is more significant: the application of the Tree to the ennea­ gram . The key to this equation is found in the frontispiece to the Arithmologia . Around the points of the enneagram Kircher's engraver has placed numbers. In the diagram of the Tree of Life numbers are traditionally allotted to all the Sephiroth except Daath, or Knowledge, a mysterious or \"invisible\" Sephimh which is often omitted. The particular numbers are fixed and certa in; they fo rm part of the s ystem of correspondences which assigns, fo r example, planets, colors, metals, emotions, or personal characte ristics, to the influence of a particular Sephimh . So if we have reason to believe that Kircher's ennea gram represents the Tree of Life in another form, it is likely that the numbers surrounding the symbol are simply the shortest way of denoting the different Sephiroth . 6 TlPHARETH , KETHER �OD TlPHARETH KETHEA HOD In the Arithmologia, Kircher explains the three triangles of his ennea­ gram as representing the \"three degrees\" into which the \"nine choirs of angels\" are divided. In this figure, the three Sephirah highest on the Tree of Life-K ether, Hochmah, and Binah-f orm the triangle which stares directly out from the page . The other two triangles contain the triads of the Hesed-Gebur ah-Tiphareth and Netza ch-Hod-Yesoo. Malkuth, the King­ dom, is the sphere in which man Views all the cosmic action; in Gurd jieff's enne agram it would be represented by the circle joining the points. Kircher's symbol signifies the descent of the divine energy into matter through the creative action of triads. The first triad of Kether-Chokmah­ Binah, the second of Hesed-Gebur ah-Tiphareth, the third of N etzach-Hod­ Yesod, make up the Triple Ternary of the divine descent contemplated from the Earth or Malkuth."},{"pageNumber":520,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 517 When the Se phiroth are transf erred to the corresponding points on Gurd jieff's enneagram there is a peculiar result which can only be intentional . Whereas Kircher' s diagram is a picture of \"three degrees of angel s,\" Gurd jieff's is \"a moving diagram ,\" and the direction of the movement is marked by Ouspensky with arrows . The movement wi thin the six-sided figure representing man runs Hesed-Ge burah-Hod-Net zach­ Yesod- Tiphareth . On the orthodox diagram of the Tree of Life, this repres ents motion round the paths of the square centered on the sixth Sephirah, Tiphareth : this is known to Caba lists as the Yetziratic World, and is sometimes said to represent archetypal man. There is no space to explain what these desig nations mean, as it could only be done by reference to the rest of the Tree of Life. The important thing to notice is that the six-sided figure in Gurd jieff's enneagram refers to a particular division which makes sense on the Cabali stic Tree. The triangle which remains isolated in Gurd jieff's \"moving diagram\" is that of Kether-Chokmah-Binah, the three supreme Sephirah . Together they form the world of Atziluth or emanations from the divinity . Whe n Gurdjieff 's octave with its intervals is distributed around the outside of his ennea gram of this supreme trinity, only Kether-the Crown, the poi nt at which the divine emanations enter the worlds of the Tree of Life-has a note allotted to it. Appropriately enough this is do which begins each new octave , and by beginning signals the end o f the preceding one. The other points of the central triangle-said by Gurdjieff to represent the divine or eternal principle s-are marked with the intervals in the octave. At these interval s, Gurdjieff taught that a shock was neces ary to help the process over the point where \"vibrations become retard ed.\" But in fact, he displaced the second interval from its natural position between the notes 8i and do and inserted it between sol and la . At first sight this appears to have been done simply to satisfy th e demands of symmetry . In In Search of the Miraculous O us p e n s ky records Curdjieff as justifying this adjustment by a seri es of abstruse arguments which may or may not make sense within the context of his cosmology .

One could explore endlessly the possibilities which are opened up by the discovery that Gurd jieff' s ennea gram is an adaptation of the Tree of Lif e. But it may be wondered whether Gurd jieff's alterations resulted in a distortion from the original Traditio n: in some cases in an oversim plifica­ tion, in others a complication of an already complex symbol. Were these divergences invented by Gurdjieff, or did they come from a Traditional source? We cannot say fo r certain that Gurdjieff did take his cosmology from Athan asius Kircher. Kircher believed himself to be revealing a secret knowledge in his Arithmologia, and it is quite possible that he simply represented a tradition which Gurdj ieff could have encoun­ tered elsewhere. It must remain a matter of opinion. I believe that in the Arithmologia Kircher was expressing a final synthesis of Renaissance mysticism and that Gurd jieff's cosmology somehow derives from it. One final element of Kircher's system must be discussed, because it accounts fo r the fo rm in which he chose to express his Tree of Life. This is the influence of Ramon Lull and his Ars Magna . Both Kircher and Giorgi were devoted Lullia ns, and Kircher's ennea gram derives from one of the symbolic figures of the Lullian Art. Ramon Lull was born about 1232 in Majorca, which had only just recovered from three centuries of occupation by Islam. After a riotous and conventionally misspent youth, he had a series of visions and decided to devote himself to Christ. In order to achieve his ambition of converting Mohammeda ns, he learned Arabic and set about a synthesis of Islamic and Christian thought. The result was his immense Great Art, a symbolic system owing much to Christian Neo-Plat onism, something to the Moslem saint and Sufi al-Ghazza li, and something to the Jewish Cabala. Lull was in relations with both Sufis and Caba lists; in the words of a leading Lullian scholar, \"Lull in preparing to combat Islam, had steeped himself for years in its literature and mystic ism. He had taken many of his arms from his adversa ries. \" The object of Lull's Great Art was to demon strate . the truth of Christianity by means of symbolic diagrams illustrating the combination of fo rces which create phenomena. The backgro und against which he worked was the cosmology accepted by Jew, Arab , and West European Christian alike: the descent of the Godhead into matter through various grades of being. The result was a symbolic system based on two main figures. In the final fo rm of the Art, the Ars generalis ultima of 1305-08, the principles which in combination govern the universe are said to number nine. They"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 519 are known as the Dignities of God. The number 9 is suggestive to anyone with even a slight knowledge of Cabala, and the nature of the divine Dignities appears to be exactly the same as that of the Caba listic Sephir oth. One of the two main diagrams used by Lull in demonstrating how the combinations of the Dignities operate in the universe is known as the figure T, and it is this figure which Kircher used as the basis of his enneagr am. The second important Lullian diagram is called the Figure A, and it is based on the interconnection of all points on a circle whose circumf erence is divided by 9. It is easy to see that a particular conj unction of these points gives in one fo rm Kircher 's, and in anothe r, Gurd jieff's enneagram . It will be remembered that in In Search of the Miraculous Ouspen sky records several conversations with Gurd jieff on the subject of a universal language . Gurd jieff denounced all concocted universal language s, and declared that in any case a valid universal language already existed. When he introduced his Russian groups to the enneagram , he defined it as \"the . fundamental hieroglyph of a universal language .\" This description would apply very well to the Tree of Life; but it applies even more accurately to the Art of Ramon Lull. The Lullian Art was known to Gurd jieff's St. Petersburg group-it had been rediscovered by Anna Butkovsky and Anthony Charkovsk y-and this fact alone may have been responsible for Gurd jieff's use of the ennea gram in conversations with those pupils. However, we do know that Lull deliberately constructed his Art to provide a universal language which would unite men of all creeds under a single God. If he did in fact make use of Cabalistic traditions-and although there is no final proof, it is almost certain-he was in many ways anticipating the Christian Cabalists of the Renaissance . The synthesis of Lull precedes that of Kircher by three and a half centuri es. 5.

This smallish group of terrestrial beings is designated \"the Brother­ hood of the Essen es.\" In Meetings with Remarkable Men Gurd jieff introduces the \"Ess enes\" into his discussion about the mirac ulous effects of music. He claims that, thanks to an introduction from one of his childhood tutors, \"I had been among the Essenes, most of whom are Jews, and ... by means of very ancient Hebrew music they had made plants grow in half an ho ur.\" The miraculous accelerated growth of plants is a marvel which Kircher mentions in his own comments on the effects of sound. It is highly unlikely that Gurd jieff had really discovered any \"Essen es.\" Quite probably , Gurdjieff merely intended an allegorical brotherhood, although it seems that he did conceive of an inner teaching within Christianity which had at least informed the System which he taught. He could have found this idea in any of the Renaissance texts he might have studied; but another possible source is indicated in Meetings with Rema rkable Men . Gurdjieff talks about his attempts to recover the secret knowledge of past times and his conclusion that if a school of the sort of knowledge which he sought had ever existed, it must have been among the Assyrians or \"Aissors\" among whom he had a number of friends. This form of Christianity had (and has) a claim to be considered the most ancient and the most pure. After the Jewish wars of c. A.D. 70, Jewish Chrtstianity ceased to exist. With one except ion, all later Christian churches derive from the Church of Antioch in Syria, which was wholly Greek and within the Roman Empire. The exception was the Church of Edessa, the capital of a small principality called Osrhoene situated in the Euphrates valley east of the river. Tradition dates the beginning of the Church of Edessa to the coming of Mar Addai (the Apostle Thaddeus) in the first century. The Edessan Church was fairly certainly evangelized from Israel, and its liturgical tongue, Syriac,"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"TH E SO URCE S OF TH E SYSTE M 521 was similar to that of Palestine in the time of Christ. To Gurd jieff, a zealous seeker for the original and undistorted fo rm of ancient wisdom, both the derivation of the Edessan Church and the language of its Assyrian members would have provided a powerf ul reason fo r thinking that an \"Aissor school\" might possess the solutions which he was seeking. The particular stra ngeness of the doctrine of the Edessan Church was that it confined baptism to celiba tes. All the lusts of the flesh were considered evil, and only gradually were married Christians admitted to Church membership. It must be conceded that Gurdjieff gave no sign of observing these standards-although there is an echo of severe asceticism in \"Ozay's\" \"cessation to the utmost limit of diet, breath and sex.\" But we are not looking fo r a single source of Gurd jieff's teaching, merely at the signposts on the way. One of the signposts points from the Church of Edessa -wh ich could be seen as embodying an \"esoteric\" Christianit y-to the \"esoteric Christianity\" of the late Renaissance. Because of an error in the earliest writings on the Edessa n Church, it was widely believed until the early twentieth century that the Syriac of the Peshitt a-that Church's equivalent of the Authorized Version -was the very language spoken by Jesus himsel f. The standard English work on the canon of the Bible was still perpetuating this mistake in 1896. Current scholars hip would therefore have supported an interest in the Assyrians. What is more, the early 1890s were a time of great excite ment in Syriac studies. In the context of the romantic archaeology of Meetings with Remarkable Men, it becomes significant that in 1889, adventurous scholars penetrated the Syriac library of the Convent of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai. Two years later, in this library there was discovered a palimpsest containing the Syriac version of the New Testament. While it would be wrong to see Gurdjieff as taking a scholarly interest in New Testament studies, he might well have taken the interest of an esoteric antiquarian . Stimulated either by personal acquaintance with his \"Aissor\" friends, or by contemporary interest in Syriac, Gurd jieff might have turned to the Peshitta itself. Its first editor was the German humanist, J. A. Widman stet­ ter (1506-57) , who originated the notion that the language of the Peshitta was that of Christ. With Widmanstette r we are back in the atmosphere of Renaissance mysticism of which Kircher was almost the last represent ative . Widman stetter studied Hebrew and learned Arabic. Then in Italy he accidentally met an old man who showed him the Syriac Gospels and claimed to be the sole remaining expert on the language . The result was an edition of the Peshitta which Widman stetter published in Vienna in 1555 in collaboration with the legate of the Patriarch of Antioch . This text was certainly known to Kircher. His fellow Orientalist, Andreas Muller (l630-94)--a corre spondent of Kircher who succes sfully exposed the"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"522 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE fantastic nature of the Jesuit's imagination-made a study of Syriac based on Widman stetter's Peshitta. Not only does Gurd jieff's fascination with the Church of Edessa fit with contemporary interest at the end of the nineteenth century, but it had also been a preoccupation of the seven­ teenth-century Jesuits whose work almost certainly inspired his Own cosmology. In Widmanstetter's Peshitta there is an elaborate and suggestive diagram of the Tree of Life. It is all the more interesting because there seems no reason whatever fo r its inclusion in the text . The representation of the Tree is said to be that of \"John, the apostle of Jesus Chris t,\" who was recalled \"f rom Asia\" by his bishop. He then climbed a mountain near Ephesus a nd had a vision in which were contained the opening words of his Gospel: \"In the beginning was the word . . .\" The diagram shows the rest of his visio n, in which the Sephir oth of the Tree of Life are associated with the wounds of Christ on the Cross. From the point of view of Gurd jieff's teaching, the interesting feature of this Tree is that around Malkuth-the Kingdom, the physical world, the bottom Sephir ah-is curled the crescent moon. Fro m In Search of the Miraculous and the whole tenor of Ouspensky's teaching, we know that fo r Gurd jieff the moon was the last note on the Ray of Creation, deep in matte r, the realm of inorganic life. Although in some Cabalistic systems the moon may be attributed to Malkuth, it is far more often given to Yesod-the Sephirah above Malkuth, the realm of reflection and imaginati on. Here, in the pages of the Syriac Peshitta, is a Tree of Life attributing the moon to Malkuth, and linking all at once Gurd jieff's Ray of Creation, the Christianity of the Aissors, and the Cabalistic mysticism of the Renaissance. It is most unlikely that Gurd jieff stumbled upon Widman stetter' s Tree­ although there remains an outside chance that, surrounded by a bewilder­ ing conflict of belie fs , and searching fo r an unpolluted tradition of Christianity, he might have been attracted to a version of the Great Hieroglyph somehow associated with the Church of Edessa. What the coincidence does show is that in the crisis of the Renaissance and Refor mation, men concerned to mend the once seamless robe of Christ and retrieve meaning out of chaos made use of a syncretism based on Cabalistic and Pythagorean principles which it seems legitimate to call \"esoteric Christianity .\" Conf ronted with a similar crisis of consciou sness, Gurdjieff may well have responded in a similar fashion--either by consciously imitating the example of that sort of esoteric Christianity represented by Kircher, or by making his own synthesis with similar motives and with similar results. It is just possible that Gurdjieff did find some secretly preserved version of Christianity in his travels through the Middle East.

Gurdjieff himself tells us that, after he had exhausted the possibilities contained in the relatively obvious fo rms of Christianity with which he came in contact , he abandoned the present fo r \"legominisms\" from the past. In his quest fo r origins, he would certainly have pushed his inquiries as far back historically as he could go. And he could scarcely have avoided the religious and philosophical tumult of the first two centuries after the birth of Christ, when the sects known as Gnostic flourished throughout the eastern Mediterranean . There is no agreement as to the origins of Gnostic ism. Professor Hans Jonas insists that the distinctively Gnostic doctri nes derived neither from the established philosophies of the Hellenistic world, nor from \"the established religions of the East. The Gnostic faiths seem to be rooted in a syncretism of religions-but the more occult, the more hidden, the more mystical currents of theological speculatio n. Professor Jonas thinks that there is a definite link between the beginnings of Gnosticism and the beginnings of Cabala; and whatever their origins, the Gnostic systems embody the doctrine of the divine ensnarement in matte r. In the Neo­ Platonic philosophies, this is fo und in an abstract and sophis ticated form. In the Gnostic religions the idea occurs in a more magical and occult version. Both Margaret Anderson and C. S. Nott have traced Gurd jieff's teaching back to the Gnostics, who in a sense provide the most obvious parallel, particularly if we are to take seriously Gurd jieff's statement that he taught \"esoteric Christianit y.\" For in the early years of the Christian religion, before Church councils and power struggles had codified theology, there was considerable doubt as to what Christianity was. Whereas virtually all theologians might accept some version of the hierarchical universe emanat­ ing from the Godhead, the concl usions to be drawn from this cosmology were a matter fo r dispute. The version of Christianity which triumphed was one which affirmed in a limited fashion the virtues of the world; and the Gnostic Christians, the representatives of the more magical and world­ rejecting points of view, were def eated . Of all the Gnostic systems, the most Christian and the most impressive is the powerful vision of Valentin us, whose thought Ptofessor Jonas calls \"the culmination of ... the Syrian-Eg yptian type of Gnostic speculat ion.\" Vale ntinus taught in Rome for some twenty-five years before A.D. 160, and a succession of disciples elaborated his system. The Valentinians seem to have aimed at establishing an inner circle of \"true Christians\" within the orthodox Church, and this particular version of esoteric Christianity provides a suggestive parallel to the efforts of Gurdjieff nineteen centuries later. One of the most notable Valentinian converts was Bardaissan of Edessa, who had belonged to the \"Aissor\" Church and made a journe,y to"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 525 Armenia. His views on what Gurd jieff called \"the law of fa te and the law of acci dent\" are virtually identical to Gurd jieff's own teac hing. Gurd jieff certainly knew much of what could be known in his day about the Gnostic system s. It is possible to find a great deal of what he taught in one or another of the great heresiarch s--or in the Christian writers like Origen and Clement of Alexandria, who inclined more than a little toward ideas of a Gnostic nature. How Gurd jieff became attracted to the Gnostics we cannot know fo r certa in; for there were countless possible avenues down which his mind could have trave led. But the most likely possibility is that this quest for a primordial version of Christianity led him to the Gnostics via the \"esoteric Christianity\" of the nineteenth-century occult revival . In Western Europe the phrase \"eso teric Christianity\" is associated with the names of Anna Kingsf ord and Edward Maitland. Anna King sford (184 �8) was a leading light of the Victorian occult world , an ardent antivi visectionist, and a friend of Mme. Blava tsky. The visions which she experienced under ether were elaborated by Maitland and herself into an occult system based on alchemy and Gnosticis m. To this they gave the name of \"esoteric Christianity ,\" and the expression became a commonplace among the occult groups of London and Paris. As fa r as their system was Christian at all, it represented Jesus as a Gnostic magus who had sojourned in the wilde rness of the Essenes and returned to preach an esoteric doctrine in Israel. .In 1891 Maitland fo unded an \"Esoteric Christian Union,\" but the new gospel spread chiefly through the medium of the Theosophical Society-in 1901 Annie Besant published a book of her own called Esoteric Chrlstianity-and in Eur ope the theory became known through the hugely succ essful The Great Initiates (1889) of the French Theosophist Edouard S�hure. When he described his System as \"esoteric Christianity ,\" Gurd jieff might merely have been bowing to the need to define himself in a way which could be accepted in Holy Russia. When the fa shion fo r mysticism swept into St. Petersburg from Paris, the commonplaces of Western occultism became fused in an unlikely alloy with the more superstitious traditions of the Orthodox Church. The idea that there existed hidden starlzy fa scinated those who were seeking fo r a Master, and the semi-occult vision which this produced led to the rumor that these \"invisible\" holy men represented the esoteric trad ition in Orthodoxy. Gurd jieff was dealing in fa miliar ideas, and the associati ons of the phrase \"esoteric Christianity\" would have been perf ectly well known to Ouspensky. 6. Esoteric Buddhism To a believer in \"esoteric Chris tianity\"-or to someone obsessed with the need to discover the original fo rms of religious traditions-a progression from Christianity to Buddhism was not the unlikely journey that it seems."},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"526 THE HARMO NIOUS CIRCLE In 1894, the year before the Seekers fo r Truth are supposed to have been founded, the Russian N. A. Notovitch published in Paris his The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ, which had a subst antial impact on Theosophical thought. Notovitch also wrote books on the political role of Russia and was much concerned with the conflict of interests between the Russian and British Empires in Cent ral Asia. It is quite possible that he was involved in the Great Game. In The Unknown Life of Jesus Christ, Notovitch claims that after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 , he began a period of wandering \"without any definite plan\" through Central Asia. In Herald of Coming Good, Gurd jieff uses almost the identical phrase about his own travels in the same parts of the world; * and the expression chimes all too well with the appare ntly purposeless meanderings of an information-gatherer to be altogether ignored. Notovitch's own ro() ute led him over the Caucasus and through Persia to Mghanistan and India. He probably made several journeys, for the trip on which he claimed to have discovered his controversial material supposedly took place in late 1887. Traveling through Ladak h, he injured his leg and made an enforced halt in the Buddhist monastery of Himis, near Leh. He discovered that this monastery had in its library copies of texts preserved at Lhasa concerning the activities of Jesus Christ in India. Notovit ch claims that he persuaded the abbot of the monastery to read him the texts, while he transcribed the translation made by his interpr�ter. Jesus, whom Notovit ch's text calls \"Issa, \" is supposed to have left Palestine at the age of thirteen and traveled with a group of merchants to Sind. He spent six years in Jagganath , Rejegriha, Benares, and \"the other holy cities\" where he studied the Vedas . He began preach ing to the lower caste Vaisyas and Sudras, denouncing the caste structure and the many gods of Hinduism. This aroused the anger of the Brahmins and Kshatriyas who planned to kill him, but Issa was warned by the Sudras and fled to the Himalayas . Here he learned Pali and studied the Sutras for another six years. When he had completed his Buddhist studies he left the hills and traveled westward, denouncing sacrifices and idolatry . N otovitch' s account ends with the \"Tibetan\" version of Jesus' trial and crucifixion . This asserts that Pilate sent his troops to remove the body of Jesus from the tomb which was becoming a symbol of resistance to Rome. The foreword to The Unknown Life of Jesus claims to describe the reac­ tions of various dignitari es of the Church to Notovitch 's discovery; one and all, they tried to discourage him from publishing his material . It is quite probable that he was a hoaxer; for although the legend of Jesus' Indian *In another boo k, Alexander III et son entourage, Notovitch has a chapter on \"Some Remarkable Men.\""},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 527 journey is quite well known in Kashmir, such a publication fits suspiciously well into the anticlerical and Theosophical agitation of the 1890s. The book was immedi ately successf ul, appeared in English and American editions, and provided Theosophists with an eff ective argument fo r the theory that all religions derived from the East-perhaps ultimately from some hallowed center of occultism in the Himalayas . The Issa of whom Nikolai Notovitch informed the world appears in Annie Besant's Esoteric Christianity . Whether or not The Unknown Life of Jesus contains an accurate tran­ scription of material Notovitch found in Ladakh , Gurd jieff had certainly read the book or knew and believed its arguments. In Tiflis he told Carl Bechhofer Roberts as a fact that Jesus had studied in a Tibetan monastery . The romantic tone of the discovery in a remote monastery of documents vital to an understanding of the origins of Christianity would certainly have appealed to Gurd jieff; and Notovitch would undoubtedly have been discussed in Russian Theosophical circles even if no closer contact had existed between the two players of the Great Game. The idea that the real, the \"esoteric ,\" Christianity had derived from Buddhism would explain precisely what Gurdjieff was doing in Tibet as the pupil of Agwan Dordj ieff. It may also explain quite a lot about the relation ship between Dordj ieff, the convert to Orthodoxy Shamzaran Badma ieff, and Prince Ukhtomsky, the Theosophist -who, although he announced himself as a practi sing Bud­ dhist, was once described by Badmaieff in a letter to Nicholas II as a good Christian. At this point there is an unexpected link betw een the esoteric Chris­ tianity of Athanasius Kircher and the exploits of \"Ushe Narzunoff\" in Tibet. Before Narzunoff's photograph of the Potala was published, the only picture which Europe possessed of that impressive building was a draw ing in Kircher's China Illustrata (1670). This volume fo rmed part of the Jesuit's work as an Orientalist and conta ined accounts of Tibet by missionaries belonging to his Order. Before the epidemic of Tibetan voyages at the close of the nineteenth century, Kircher's book was still much more than a curiosity for travelers to Central Asia, and it is quite possible that Gurd jieff first became interested in the Jesuit scholar by way of his China lllustrata . Joseph Deniker reproduced Kircher's illustr ation of the Potala in his edition of Narzunoff 's travel diary in Le Tour du Monde . Waldo Frank thought that Gurd jieff's system was \"clearly derived\" from Buddhism. He may have made his own investigati ons, but most probably based this opinion on the idea current among Orage's groups that the technique of self � observation was outlined in a Pali scripture translated by F. L. Woodward in his Sayings of the Buddha (1935), where it is known as \"The Only Way.\" Orage's friend, Professor Denis Saurat, thought Gurd jieff \"a great connoisseur of Buddhis m\":"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"528 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Some highly educated Orientals with whom I have discussed Gurdjieff go so far as to maintain that he was simply a Buddhist who fo r personal reasons settled in the West and tried to teach some of the simplest of the methods and truths known in the Far East. ... Gurd jieff's book shows no prejudice in favour of Buddhis m, on the contrary he seems expressly to condemn the spread of Eastern ideas to w ards the West. He told me himself that he aimed at achieving a synthesis of Western science and technique on the one hand, and Eastern spirituality on the other, but he did not necessarily mean Budd hism, and was even of the opinion that all religions fo und in Asia today are degenerate fo rms of an ancient revelati on. Ouspensky once told his fo llowers that the ideas of the System could be recogn ized in Budd hism. A fo rmer pupil writes that \"he did not say what kind of Buddhi sm, but I supposed that he ref erred to the Pali texts translated by Rhys Davids in Volume II (Dialogues of the Buddha) of Sacred Books of the Buddhists , because 1 thought 1 had seen that book on Mme. O.'s bedside table .\" The European who became the Lama Angarika Govinda quotes Ouspensky in support of the tec hniques of the Pali scripture s fo r o rienting oneself in a universe of many dimensions, and it would be natural to find corre spondences in the Pali texts-of which \"T he Only Way\" is one-bec ause fo r several reasons these could have appeared to Gurd jieff as the repository of the earliest and most esoteric Buddhist teachings. For centuries after the death of the Buddh a in 480 B.C., the scriptures were not writte n down and the Pali Canon took fo rm in the first century A. D. It is divided into three groups, of which the most \"esoteric\" is the Abhidamma-Pita ka, a collection of books on \"f urther doctrine\" or \"the super-doctrine. \" Professor Edward Conze explains that these were meant fo r \"the very core of the Buddhist elite.\" Anyone fa miliar with the techniques outlined by Orage fo r the detailed practice of self-observation would recogn ize a less sophis ticated form of the analysis decreed by the Abhid amma . Anything a person may think of as his own is analzyed into its \"ultimates\" excluding any ego over and above these elements. The first five ultimates are .known as the Skand has-the material attributes, fe elings, perception, impulse, and act of consci ousness. Professor Conze gives an example of an analysis of the phenomenon: \"I have a toothache .\" 1. There is the fo rm of the tooth as matter. 2. There is a painful fe eling . 3. There is a sight-, touch-, and pain-perception of the tooth ."},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 529 4. There is by way of volitional reactions: resentment at pain, fear of possible consequences, greed fo r physical well-being, etc. 5. There is consciousn ess- and awareness of all this. While nothing we know of Gurd jieff's theory approach es the complexity and sophistication of the Abhidamma, his general approach was based on a similar attitude, and possibly he borrowed certain specific ideas from the esoteric teaching of the Pali texts: fo r example, the fourth book of the Abhidamma -Pitaka is a treatise on human types. But he may have picked up theory from many different varieties of Buddhism, including odd sects like the Tantri cs, and there is one influence on his technique which is glaringly obviou s: the heterodox Buddhism known as Cha'an or Zen. When one of his pupils once asked him whether the System had anything in common with Zen, Ouspensky replied, \"With Buddhism, but not with Zen Buddhi sm.\" On the other hand, when D. T. Suzuki attended a demonstration of Gurd jieff's movements in New York, he is said to have called the System, \"Zen fo r the West.\" Margaret Anderson writes that Eugen Herrigel's book, Zen in the Art of Archery, parallels in a striking way the method of Gurd jieff's teach ing. And once more, if Gurdjieff did take ideas from the Zen Masters, there might have been some stimulus fo r his believing that Zen represented an esoteric tradition within Buddhism. This point of view has been put forward by Alan Watts, and may represent the legacy of Theosophical opinion. In Meetings with Remarkable Men Gurd jieff describes a game which he says that his father played with his friend Dean Borsh, and which he calls kastousilia . This procedure is so much like that of the Zen stories known as mondo or \"question-answer\" as to be no coincidence-and there are of course no coincidences . Gurd jieff's example is of Dean Borsh suddenly asking his father where God was at that moment. Gurd jieff's father replied that God was in the forest region of Sari Kamish. The Dean asked what God was doing there. The answer was that God was making double ladders on the tops of which \"he was fastening happi ness.\" Gurd jieff remarks that the two men used sometimes to carry on long conversations in this idiom, which would have seemed quite mad to an outsider. He adds: \"Many of these conversations which then seemed to me so meaningless grew to have a deep meaning fo r me later when I came across questions of the same kind. . . .\" He might well have found such questions and answers in a Zendo in China or Japan . An example from Suzuki shows the similarity: Shi, of Yang-shan, was washing his robe when Tan-yuan came along and asked: \"Where is your thought at this moment?\" Shi at once retort ed: \"At this very moment what thought do you want me to have?\""},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"530 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE The correspondence between Gurd jieff and Zen seems to have heen most pronounced toward the end of his life; but D. T. Suzuki's description of an irate Master of \"primitive\" Zen equally well describes the inconsistent and combative charact er of Gurd jieff at Fontainebleau . In the Zen monastery physical labor is considered importan t, a particular status is ascribed to those performing kitchen service , and there is constant sutra­ reading, which does not require that the listeners grasp intellectually what they hear. Most interesting of all, the parallels between the routine of the Prieure and the practice of the Zendo is the ritual of the bath. One Bodhisattva is said to have attained enlighte nment while bathi ng, and several Zen Masters have made symbolic use of the bath in their teaching. Even the apparent conflict of opinion among Gurd jieff's followers as to the significance of Gurd jieff's ritual baths corresponds to the conflicti ng answers of two Zen Masters to the question, \"Why all this constant bathi ng?\" One replies: \"Even the idea of cleanliness is to be done away with.\" And a second contradicts the first: \"Just a dip, and no why.\" When Gurd jieff arrived in the West no knowledge of Zen existed in Europe or America. On the other hand , the origins of mainstream Buddhism in the \"Eightfo ld Middle Path\" taught by the Buddha would have been well known ; and the idea of the Middle Way transposes accurately into that of the harm oniously developed man, the apostle of the balance . Gurd jieff w as not seeking a union of all religion s, as were so many Theosophists of his day. Rather does he seem to have been reconstruct­ ing-as he told Denis Saurat-the \"original revelation\" from which he assumed all the great religions to have been deriv ed. Pushing farther and fa rther back, fo llowing occult Traditions to their sourc es, he would have found an \"esoteric Buddhism\" as he would have fo und an \"esoteric Christianity . \" And although he was not seeking a union of all religi ons, his search fo r a primordial wisdom must have led him to the publications of the Theosophi­ cal Society. From their headquarters at Adyar, from their American, British, and French branc hes, from their underground cells in Russia, the Theosophists acted as the central clearing house for all esoteric ideas . Although they snapped up Anna Kingsf ord's \"Esoteric Christianit y,\" their own teachi ngs first came to the attention of Europeans under the name of \"esoteric Buddhi sm.\" In the book which he published under this title in 1883, the journalist A. P. Sinnett summarized the cosmology which H. P. Blavatsky later embodied in The Secret Doctrine . The idea of esoteric Buddhism was as well known to occult circles as that of esoteric Chris­ tianity, and Ouspensky's stay in Ceylon in 1913 was dominated by the impression that he could discover some secret teaching beneath the established religion of the Therav edins.

The Occult Revival Most of the materials fo r Gurd jieff's cosmology can be fo und in the teachings of the late nineteenth-century occult r evival ; and contemporary occultism could easily have suggested lines of research leading to ideas which other investi gators ignored. Number symbolism is an example: several tomes on the subject appeared in Germany during the nineteenth century. In 1882 the Austrian spiritualist Baron Helle nbach published his Magie der Zahlen, which could have led the seeker at one remove to Athanasius Kircher; fo r Hellen bach often ref ers to the Gesetz der Quadrat of the Viennese surgeon, Franz Liharzic, which conta ins a reproduction of Kircher's ennea gram with a reference to the Arithmologia . And far from being as unfamiliar to his contemporaries as Gurd jieff pretended, the ennea gram was well known to the \"magician s\" of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , based in Londo n. In their published rituals will be fo und the lecture given to initiates on \"Polygons and Polygrams\"--of course, from an arithmological-occult point of view. The lecture describes the magical attributes of the enneagram, which is associated with the moon and the Sephirah Yesod on the Tree of Life. This does not mean that Gurd jieff read Baron Helle nbach or was initiated into the Golden Dawn . It shows simply that others were working the same quarr ies, and that his cosmology was part of a general revival of interest in Traditional doctr ine. For exam ple, the Golden Dawn lecture on Pythagorean figures was partly based on the researches of one of its founders, the London coroner, William Wynn Westcott . His Numbers, Their Occult Significance and Power was published by the Theosophical Society in 1890 and contains a reference to Kircher. Westcott also used a symbolism of squares, triang les, and geometr ical figures to indicate different stages of human knowledge . Such ideas were the common property of occultists in Lond on, Paris, Vienna, Prague, and St. Petersburg. Everyone in these small circles knew, or knew of, each other; and every new contribution was eagerly assessed to see how it could be fitted into the huge syntheses which most of the occultists were engaged in construct ing. A couple of years of occult reading -for he would not have been encumbered by much modern occult luna cy-wo uld certai nly have equipped Gurdjieff with all the material which he was likely to n�ed.

Harris's most famous convert was the Scottish Member of Parliament, Laurence Oliphant, whom he compelled to sew and to peddle food on the local train. Two genteel ladies were made to act as cook and chambermaid in a hotel, and a Quaker deputed to act as barman . Gurd jieff's deliberately eccentric use of European languages was quite probably modeled on the tactics of the eighteenth-century occultist, Martines de Pasqua lly, who was a hero to the Symbolist mystics of the 1890s. The most unexpected occult source fo r Gurd jiefl\"'s ideas is the American \"Rosicrucian ,\" Paschal Beverly Randol ph, who flourished in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Randolph was a talented and extraordin­ ary figure. Half-Neg ro by birth, he made a reputation as a lecturer on the American Civil War and other patriotic subjects, but felt always that his ancestry prevented his real merits from being recognized. Eventually he relapsed into a welter of occultism and quack medicine. The essence of Rando lph's teach ing was sexual. Gurd jieff sometimes gave personal advice on sexuality by word of mouth, but his general teaching was clear enough. Sex was a sacred function of which there should be two results: the procreation of children and the \"coating and perfection of ... 'higher parts.'\" In Russia he taught that the most refined substance produced by the body was sperm, and that it was the sperm which fo rmed the fo urth body which made man immortal. This is Ran dolph's doctrine in all respects . The detail which really ties Randolph to Gurdjieff is the American's constant references to \"Ansairetic Mysteries\" said to be secrets of \"the Syrian mountaineers .\" This associates him directly with Gurd jieff's empha­ sis on the role of the \"Aissors\" in Meetings with Remarkable Men. Unfortunately fo r any theory which would make Gurd jieff and Randolph heirs to the same esoteric tradition, the latter decided to reveal the source of his wisdom in The New Mola (1873). \"Early in life,\" he wrote , \"I discovered that the fact of my ancestry on one side, being what they were [sic] was an effectual estoppal on my preferment ...

It is difficult to see where else Gurdjieff could have derived his doctri ne; and from relatively respectable and earnest seekers for truth, he evidently turned to the most dubious members of the esoteric fringe. The vision of Gurdjieff as the representa­ tive of centuries-old wisdom is once more clouded by doubt -was he, after all, just another of the false prophets who were spawned by the turn-of-the­ century passion for things occult? With the exception of sex magic, most occult ideas somehow fo und their way into the large body of literature published by the Theosophical Society. From the Theosophical presses poured volume after volume confounding Western Traditional knowledge with Buddhism and the religion of the Vedas . Gurd jieff used the Theosophical terms \"astral body,\" \"ment al body,\" and \"casual body,\" and it was almost certainly through Theosophical references that he developed his teach ing of the seven centers of man. Without much question these are based on the Tantric chakras, the centers of fo rce in the human body, which first became known in the West through the works of Sir John Woodroff e and which Theosoph ists like the notorious Bishop Leadbeater incorporated into the occult canon. There are examples of the seven centers in the works of Renaissance mystics, and near analogies like those of Francesco Giorgi who applied the octave to the human being; but the most likely route by which the seven centers arrived in Gurd jieff's teaching is through Theosophical sources. It is also likely that the stray Hindu elements in his ideas arrived by way of Theos ophy: such as the idea of fo od as the prime matter of the universe and the comparison of the Self with the owner of horse, carriage and driver; both of which are found in the Upanishads . It has been suggested that Gurd jieff's doctrine of the \"three forces\" implies a debt to the Samkhya philosop hy; but the three gunas of Samkhya were well known to Theosoph­ ists, and appear in the book which probably provided a starting point fo r Gurd jieff's own occult synthesis. This is H. P. Blavatsky's monume ntal The Secret Doctrine (1888). In its weighty bulk are to be found references to the fo ur bodies of man, to the \"ray\" of creat ion, to number symbolism, including a reference to Hellenbach's Magie der Zahlen which would eventually have led the reader to Kircher, applicati ons of the octave to the chemical elements and the musical scale .... And apart from Gurd jieff's admission that he did follow up Mme. Blavatsky's references, there is one striking plagia rism. This is the renaming of the fo ur elements \"hydrogen ,\" \"nitrog en,\" \"oxyg en,\" and \"carb on,\" which was first accomplished on page 593 of the second volum � of Mme. Blavatsky's masterpiece. When Ouspensky describes the lecture in which Gurd jieff first intro­ duced this terminology, he notes that Gurd jieff confirmed that \"carb on,\" \"oxyg en,\" \"nitrog en,\" and \"hydroge n\" did correspond to the ancient"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"534 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE elements of fire, air, earth, and water. He adds that \"although G. had definitely promised to explain precisely why these names were taken and not others, he never did so. . . . Attempts to establish the origin of these names explained to me a great deal concern ing the whole of G.' s system as well as its history .\" We may begin to wonder why so much insistence is placed on the unprofitable nature of research into the origins of the System, and why several modern suggestions seem designed to divert inquiry on to the wrong track . Ouspensky's inquiries must h ave turned up a great deal of evidence--he knew all the Theosophical literature and much other occult literature as well. Other researchers must also have stumbled on clues to the origins of Gurd jieff's cosmology ; and despite some odd antics , his fo llowers are very far from all being fools or knave s. If this is kept in mind, we shall come very much nearer the nature of Gurd jieff's Method. 8. Psychology, Religion and the Work \"There is nothing so explosive as old ideas restated in contemporary terms,\" P. L. Travers has written of Gurdjieff. But was Gurdjieff expressing old ideas-in the sense of old theories-or was he in fact expressing something else, something far older; a series of wisdoms as old as the first wise man? Because the teach ing was presented differently by different teachers, and because they all had to have regard to their own nature and the nature of their pupils, the introduction was made in different fo rms relating to the time and place . This simply means that the terms of the situation must always be contemporary; they must be those which seem to have meaning. If the pupil finds the ambiguities of The Secret Doctrine relevant to his personal situati on, that is where the teacher starts . The Victorian occult revival certainly colored Gurd jieff's own early search fo r truth. But was it a Hight from reason or a return from alienation? In one aspect, it was an attempt to transpose the topics which had been traditionally the province of religion and the priest into the age of science and the scientist. The whole spectrum of subjective experien ce--of being­ in-the-world , of mental phenomena also-had been excluded by the uncompromising mate rialism of early Victorian science. The religiously inclined, and the few with a real interest in questions of being- in-the-world, struggled with the task of translating the events of the psyche into a language which would have meaning fo r a society conditioned by the sci<:mtific mirac le. The continued advance of science has made the premature efforts of the occult revival both out of date and emotionally suspect. Science moved on from its primitive dogmat ism, the theory of Relativity made its appearan ce, and the protests of occultists again st mate rialism no longer tempt the"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 535 serious thinker. Yet the occult attempt to restate the perennial problems has had two important results. The first was the appearance of a small number of thinkers who tried to develop the approach of Victorian occultism in a more sophisticated way. There were a bare half-dozen, of whom Gurd jieff may have been one. Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Steiner are two others. Gurd jieff can be quite easily compared to Steiner, who also passed through the influence of nineteenth-century occultism before extrac ting the material which he elaborated into his \"spiritual science ,\" Anthroposophy . There are certain similarities in the approach of the two men; the search fo r a form to suit the times, the use of movements a la Dalcroze, the theme of the Struggle of the Magician s. A second result of the internalizing of thought was the psychoanalytic movement. There is evidence which suggests that Freud had a closer contact with the oc cultists of Vienna than has ever been admitt ed, * and in the school of analytical psychology stemming from C. G. Jung, attention swung back to a consideration of topics treated by alchemy, Swedenborg, and the Gnostics. Although approach ing from the opposite direction , the new psychologists were perplexed by the same sort of problems as troubled the spiritual teachers, and they were under similar influence. While the Steiners and the Gurd jieffs searched through tradition fo r fo rgotten knowledge , the psychologists rediscovered the fo rbidden area of being-in­ the-world and proposed to subject it to the scientific method. In both cases there was bound to result a restate ment of old ideas in contemporary terms. Because Gurd jieff's System was intended to be in a form \"accessible to contemporary man,\" and also because it had been worked out through the sources to which contemporary man naturally turned, it has some corre­ spondence with other serious attempts to redefine intangibles. Ouspensky used to recommend the study of the \"older\" psychology and certain Theosophical works . The threef old division of man into body, emotions, and intellect was a commonpla ce of prescientific psychology . It is also fo und in Laurence Oliphant, Vladi mir Soloviev, Papus, Steiner, and countless occult writers. In the interesting system called \"Statuvoli sm,\" constructed in the 1870s by the American hypnotist and phrenologist, William Baker Fahnestock, can be fo und many resemblances to Gurd jieff's psychology . On a more occult level, Annie Besant's A Study in Conscious ness (1904) contains some interesting ideas as well as much talk of \"ultimate atoms.\" It is subtitled \"a study in psychology .\" More conventional psychology has left fewer traces in Gurd jieff's teac hing.

Gurdjieff and Ouspensky always gave psychoana lysis a very bad press, regarding it as fu rther involving man in the unreal world , but Kenneth Walker in his The Conscious Mind has compared Freud's views on psychology with those of Gurdjieff. Apart from their agreement that \"wrong sex\" forms one of the chief sources of human misery, there is little to just ify the comparison. The parallel with Jung is much more exact. The similarity is sometimes so marked that the two are said to have met; but Arnold Keyserling once secured a denial from Jung himself. The parallel stems chiefly from Jung's own occult reading, and particularly from his reliance on the Christian Gnostics. Of all the twentieth-century psycholog ies, the approach apparently closest to Gurd jieff's is Behavior ism. In its insistence on the mechanical conditioning of man-that man cannot do, that he is done to-and in its utter materia lism, the System as defined by Ouspensky seems to have much in common with the theories made popular by J. B. Watson. It was not entirely wishful thinking which made Orage 's followers see their Method as \"the step beyond Behaviourism .\" The origins of Behaviorism lay in Russia, in Pavlov's fa mous dogs, and the language of Behaviorism belonged at first particularly to Russian thought. If Mme. Blavatsky was in one sense the protest of the religious conscience again st Darw in, Gurdjieff representes the first adjustment of the \"spir\" itually-minded\" to Pavlovian psychology . All these similarities are in theoretical terms. It is when we move from theory to practice that the Gurdjieff Method appea rs most individual, and in so far as there is a consistent method, this is provided by the theatrical element, the philosophy of role playing which derives from Gurd jieff's own imperson ation of Everyman and Superman. But the very term \"role playing\" is not peculiar to Gurd jieff's System, and the emphasis which his followers place on the idea seems to be a relatively late develo pment. It was in 1923 that the whole idea of role playing as an explanation of psychological problems and as a means of curing them was broached by the Rumanian psychoana lyst, Jacob L. Moreno. In that year Moreno published his book, Vas Stegr eiJtheater (Theatre of Spontaneity), based on experiments which he had begun in Vienna two years earlier. He had started with the idea that actors on the stage experienced a great conflict between their own interpretations of a part and what Moreno called \"role-conserves\" -type roles artificially embalmed in the text of the drama tist. \"I remember the struggle in Eleanora Duse between herself as a private dramatis persona, and the roles she had to impersonate; the struggle between the role-concepts created by the playwright and the concepts she had of these charact ers.\" From this starting"},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"THE SOUR CES OF THE SYSTEM 537 point, Moreno developed on the one hand a theory of roles in society, and on the other, a whole series of techn iques based on the dramatization of the pati ent's problems. Even the names of his techniques are suggestive: \"role­ reversal ,\" the \"mirror-techniq ue,\" \"double ego,\" \"psychodramatic shoc k.\" \"Psy chodra ma,\" Moreno write s, \"is the science of the actor .... The actor must become an observer of hims elf. \" Moreno's techniques and terminology are so similar to the vocabulary of \"playing a role\" that there must have been some contact between the fo llowe rs of Gurd jieff and the theories of psychodrama. As to Gurdjieff hims elf, it is impossible to say. It does seem unlikely that he would pay much attention to a European who had developed fo r himse lf some of his own techniques; but without implying any debt to Moreno, Gurd jieff's Method can be described as a particular fo rm of psychodram a. And what is real in a universe where everything is theatrical? What is and what is not meant to be taken seriously? Gurd jieff's world is one of doubts, of the shadows of ideas, of uncertainty over the most normal-seeming appeara nce. What is the role of the cosmology in this altered version? 9. Theater and the World Moreno's psychodrama is not the only contemporary development with which Gurd jieff's dramatic experiment can be compared . It seems certain that there must have been contact with the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavsky (186 3--1938), whose book, An Actor Prepares, was originally published in Russia as An Actor's Work on Himself. Stanislavsky's Method involves, like Gurd jieff's, concentration of the atte ntion and relaxation of the muscles. \"Our type of creativene ss,\" he write s, \"is the conception and birth of a new being-the person in the part . It is a natural act similar to the birth of a human being.\" In another book Stanislavsky holds out to his actor the possi­ blity of expanding his awar eness. \"Only the actor whose development proceeds along harmonious lines can, quite independently and through his own acquired experience, raise himself step by step to a wider con­ sciou sness. \" Other developments in the Russian theater may have been equally significa nt; in particular the work of N. N. Evreimoff (1879-1953). Carl Bech hofer Roberts met him in Petrograd in 1915 and published translations of two of his plays in the New Age . Evreimoff is celebrated fo r his invention of \"monodram a,\" an idiom in which the internal drama of an individual's conHicting impulses is externalized on stage . Orage 's Little Review article of 1926, \"A Theatre fo r U s,�' suggestin g a representation of the three centers of man, was derived entirely from a remember ed performance of Evre­ imoff's monodrama The Theatre of the Soul at the Little Theatre in London on March 8, 1915. In theoretical term s, Evreimofl\"' s chief argu ment was"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"538 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE that all human life is governed by the theatrical instinct; and here he influenced Ouspensky, who recommended his book The Theatre in Life (1927) in A New Model of the Universe . Evreimoff ends The Theatre in Life with a confession of faith in his God, \"Theatrar ch\" : \"I believe that having played thousands of roles, more and more difficul t, I approach closer and closer to him, my director, until, perfectly trained in the dramatic cycle of the cosmos, I became at last his insepa rable and worthy colleag ue.\" This idea of a theatrical universe is an old one. We can date it back at least as far as the Hindu idea that the universe consists of the \"days and nights of Brah ma,\" of plays enacted by the god fo r his own amusement. E. R. Eddison bases the fictional world of Zimiamvia on the same poetic concepti on. Neither is the idea of a purgation by role playing confined to men of the theat er. Herman Hesse uses it in very much the same sense as Evreimoff in his novel Steppenwol J (1927). Harry Haller, the Wolf of the Steppes, the lonely visionary Outsider, prowls around the palisades of life until he discovers the magic theat er. There is a notice above the door. It reads : MAGIC THEATRE: ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY. With his attempts to gain entrance to the theater, Harry begins a surrealistic spiritual quest. Toward the end of the book he enters a booth marked \"Guidance in the building up of the personality .\" Here he learns that \"man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves.\" But he fo rgets the lesson that he plays many parts and begins to take things too seriously. In the end he commits a murd er-a theatrical murder-and is found guilty of \"the wilful misuse of the magic theatre .\" Theater in the unusual sense of the term has found a place in the communal activities of the various groups deriving from Gurdjieff. Presum­ ably ordinary dramatic productions are thought to provide material for self­ observation as valid as that given by \"spontan eous\" theater. Kenneth Burke has inaugurated a whole new school of critici sm based on the dramatic metaphor and probably deriving from Gurdjieff. At the same time there have been attempts to show that the use of theater to shock people , to disrupt what Moreno would call their \"role-conserve s,\" derives fr om Traditional wisdom. Gurd jieff' s \"Society of the Adherents of Legominism\" used the theater as a vehicle fo r self-develop ment. Orage may have been repeating something he heard from Gurdjieff when, toward the end of his life, he referred in The Aryan Path to \"one of the lesser-known traditions of the Greek drama-that its actors lived to create it\"; for it is a tradition quite unknown to historian s. Two expressions from Greek theater are suggestive : the \"persona\" or mask worn by the actor; and the actor's original designation as \"hypocrite ,\" meaning \"one who answers\" (the choru s). We do not know where Gurdjieff got his ideas about using dramatic"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"THE SOURCES OF THE SYSTEM 539 situat ions. Every academic work on the history of the theater enshrines one or another theory about the relati onship between religious ritual and the origins of the drama. A student of occult Trad ition would find the image of the world as a theater a philosophical commonplace. It is to be found in Plato and Plotinus; the Renaissance attributed the idea to Pythagoras . There is an ecclesiastical tradition which originates in St. John Chrysostom; and by the late Renaissance the rapid growth of theaters was being defended against the self-righteous by the argument that the stage was a fo rce for moral education-as Gurd jieff would have said, a \"reflector- of­ reality .\" Dr. Frances Yates has shown how the idea of the world as theater was transposed into the idea of the theater of the world, and contends that the theaters of the late Renaissance were an integral part of the occult­ philosophical world view. But the real justification for linking Gurdjieff's use of theater to occult Tradition concerns the glyph-the \"myst ery-play\" in Ouspensky's sense ­ for the beholder at a distance in time the perception that everything fa lls into place in the emblem of events; that the Passion of Christ happ ened in the only-emblem atic-way which it could have happened; that the drama of Ouspensky's death was in some way blazo ning out the heraldry of the universe. It is a quality of perception which is genuinely experienced by substantial numbers of people. This idea, which leads us to the Rosicrucian fracas of the seventeenth century, is almost more incredible than a belief in indiscriminate miracles. The stage management of history is something which it is difficult to accept-even if the play being produced has in the relative sense a very small cast indeed. The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross announced itself to the world in a series of manif estoes printed in Cassel in the years following 1614. A barrage of literature and counter-literature sprang up from people denounc­ ing, acclaiming, and seeking out the mysterious Rosicrucian s, who pro­ claimed \"a general reformation of the whole world .\" But the Brotherhood remained elusive, and it has often been wondered if it ever existed. Dr. Frances Yates in The Rosicrucian Enlightenment lays great stress on the use of the Latin term ludibrium to describe Rosicrucian activities. A ludibrium could mean \"a play scene ,\" \"a farce,\" or \"a joke.\" But, as Dr. Yates points out, those who applied the epithet to the Rosicrucians thought of the theater as an influence for good. \"The theatricality of the Rosicrucian movement, \" writes Dr. Yates, \" ... is one of the most fascinating aspects of the whole affair.\" And later she volunteers one possible interpretation of the Rose Cross ltidibrium \"not as a hoax, but as a dramatic presentation of a profoundly interesting religious and philosoph ical movem ent.\" The materials of the piece are similar to the case of Gurd jieff, Ouspensky, and the rest. The Rosicrucian manif estos describe how Frater Christian"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"540 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Rosencreuz traveled to the East in search of knowledge . In the Sly Man's pilgrimage there was material in hand to fa shion such a legend. Most importa nt, the Rosicrucians were also called \"invisible\" -they inhabited an \"invisible colleg e,\" they were an \"invisible\" brotherhood. Johann Valentin Andreae , a theologian who began by cooperating with · the Rosicrucian comedy, eventually turned against the whole ludibrium because it had become a \"dubious and slippery concern .\" There were imposters and charlatans in the field, he complained, men claiming to represent the Rosicrucia ns. When in fact, Andreae implied, there had originally been a definite purpose behind the arrange ment of a pious \"jok e,\" \"with regard to the fa shion of the age which seizes avidly on new-fangled notions. \" The nature of this purpose must still be very much a matter of opinion, but those who pushed the Rose Cross Brothers on to the Eur opean stage were probably interested in a reformation of the world on lines which were at once Prote stant, mystical, and scientific . Andreae suggested that the learned world stop blinding itself with mysteries and \"learn the way of salvatio n\" not from some occult society \"hazy, omniscient only in the eye of its own boastfulne ss,\" but fr om the Christ himself. And I suspect that this is more than a para llel with the ludibrium of the Harmonious Circle. It may be that Gurd jieff himself made the plan, or it may have been suggested by someone else entirely. The play scene is a comedy played in the theater of the world, and the play is fo r a general purpose which the covert action of the drama may not make clear. It was certainly with \"regard to the fa shion of the age which seizes avidly on new­ fangled notions\" that Gurdjieff at one time clothed his teaching in the garb of contemporary occult ism. His introductory play-scenes were always similar. First you find out what the inquirer wants and in what he is interested. Then you temper your sales pitch acco rdingly . On a historical scale, the ludibrium or myst ery play will serve the function of such an introductory comedy, until the inquirer is thoroughly \" entangled .\" Then who pushed Gurdjieff on to the stage and began the ludibrium? Was it Gurd jieff's own idea, or was he one among many? Who translated material fr om languages he could not read himself? What sort of people were behind him? We can only consider possibilitie s. The least likely is that he was fu lfilling a mission devised by some conf raternity in Centr al Asia. Only slightly less probable is the idea that he constructed his System entirely unaided. The more his theoretical teaching is studied, the more it divides itself into two section s: a definitely Orien tal part, based largely on Buddhist thought with an admixture of Sufi lore; and a definitely Western part, fo unded on European occu ltism as derived fr om the Gnostics, Neo-Platoni sts, and Rosicrucian s.

It is likeliest that he was himself largely responsible fo r the Oriental side of his teaching: the Buddhist psychology , the theories of movement, and the Eastern aspects of those ideas clearly inspired by The osophy. It is equally probable that he worked closely with more educated persons who were at home in the scholarly traditions of European occulti sm. The collaboration of Prince Ukhtomsky alone would confine Gurd jieff's achievement within a more believable compas s. There remains the possibility that the Seekers fo r Truth existed not as a band of esoteric explorers , but as Gurd jieff's equivalent to the invisible Rosicruci ans. However improbable such an organization may sound, it must be insisted that fin de siecle Russia could have contained any philosophical grouping, includin g one dedicated to fo unding a new religion by under­ cover means. H. P. Blavatsky was a Russian; and there is more than a suggestion of her tactics in Gurd jieff's own. Prince Ukhtomsky's conception of the Theosophical Society as a clandestine organization is also suggestive. It is because of the Russian Revolution that we know of Gurd jieff at all; but the Revolution may also have destroyed evidence of other men engaged in similar activit ies. Several of Gurd jieff' s fo llowe rs have alleged that after Essentuki he degenerated . This is often given some mysterious occult significance ; but if the observation has any basis in fact, it may simply show that he was handicapped by the loss of his friends. In Meetings with Rema rkable Men he describes his last interview with the possibly historical \"Prof essor Skridlov\" before leaving for the West. If \"S kridlov\" existed, he was cut off by the Revoluti on; and Gurdjieff would have been isolated from the moral and material support of any other colleagues he possessed. He had to rely on his own resources, and the ludibrium may have been fo rced on him by circumstance s. In Russia he emphasized to Ouspensky that he could not and should not have many pupils; but financial considerations later drove him to revise this dict um. It is not surprising if there seems to be a dilution of quality in the means employed. But it remains possible that Gurd jieff was acting in accordance with some preconceived plan: not as the agent of any powe rful occult society, but simply in accordance with what had been discussed among a small group of unusual men, whom he may have encountered at any stage of his unconventional pilgrimage . The Seekers fo r Truth and the Sarmoun Brotherhood are fr aternities like that of the Rosicrucian s. Arid they ace strictly invisible. How then did Gurdjieff become an \"esoteric teache r\"?

This fact has been blurred by the ambiguity of the term \"the system\" which Ouspensky adopted from the private langu age of Gurdjieff 's St. Petersburg group . \"The System\" might be taken by Ouspensky's fo llowers as referring to the vast combina­ tion of cosmological and psychological geography which their teacher had assembled. Or it might be taken as the methodical sequence of his instruction-the \"System\" of teach ing which he followed with his own pupils and had codified from the experience of his time with Gurdjieff. Orage made the distinction clearer by placing the accent on what he called the \"Method,\" and referring to the cosmol ogical or psychological theories as the greater and the lesser \"maps .\" For the Work teacher may instruct his pupils in the outlines of cartogra phy; but-as with all good teachers-the bare facts of his material do not themselves comprise the lesson which he hopes his pupils will learn .

All that can be done is to question his writings. Meetings with Rema rkable Men may have been heavily edited before its posthumous publicat ion. It was certai nly never completed as Gurd jieff originally intended. Acco rding to the prospectus printed in Herald of Coming Good, it should have consisted of at least three \"books \"-which would make its projected length simil ar to that of Beelzebub's Tales . At Gurd jieff's death the Third Series was left in a fragmentary state . Two chapters alone seem to have been completed, and others exist only in note fo rm. A chapter on \"The Four Bodies of Man\" which Gurd jieff announced in Meetings with Rema rkable Men is said to have been destroyed by the author himself. What remains of the Third Series is too incomplete to give any real idea of Gurd jieff's intentions fo r the book. That leaves us with the First Series, All and Everything : Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson . When Beelzebub's Tales was published in the spring of 1950, Amer ican reviewers -who had no doubt heard of the underground reputation of THE BOOK-were markedly scathing; and it was left to sympathizers like Gorham Munson to apologize fo r Beelzebub. Gerald Sykes considered that \"Gur djieff's reputation has been done an irreparable injury by this all but unreadable book.\" He concluded sourly: \"Mark Twain called 'The Book of Mormon ,' 'chloroform in print.' We have much better anaesthetics now.\" The Saturday Review thought the style, \"even apart from the jargon ... turbid to a degree that makes it nearly insuff erable.\" There were, this critic said, \"a fe w seeds of truth and wisdom buried in a vast midden of nonsen se.\" British critics were more affable. In The Spectator D. S. Savage declared Beelzebub's Tales to be \"wholly fascinating\"; and although in the New Statesman Kathleen Raine described the book as \"something between Gulliver's Travels, somebody's Outline of Knowledge, and a paranoiac fantasy,\" she fo und it \"strangely readable ,\" and concluded that it contained \"passages of real wisdom.\" Acco rding to Nott, the book is an \"objective work of art\" in Gurd jieff's sense if in no one else's: that is, a work constructed mathematically so as to produce a precise series of effects on its reade rs. The opportu nities which this gives fo r a species of literary pyramidology scarcely bear thinking abou t. Orage and Jean Toomer both read and commented on Beelzebub's Tales, but Orage 's comme ntary sheds little light on the darkn ess of the text and claims that \"everyt hing has three meanings and seven aspects\"­ whether or not derived from Gurd jieff himse lf-simply encourage absur­ dity. It may be true, as Orage taught, that when Gurd jieff talks about Atlan tis, he means the submer ged part of man's consciousness with which he is trying to put his pupils in contact; but just as possibly, he had the"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"A SHOR T SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 545 object of confusing the issue-or possibly Gurd jieff did believe in Atlantis and countless other disreputable theorie s.

It may enlighten some readers to be told that \"Parkt­ dolg-duty\" means \"duty\" in three languages-the refore \"duty-duty-duty\"­ but if we burrow too deep and discover such clues as delight Baconian cryptograp hers, we will have fallen into one of the traps. Gurd jieff made use of whatever peculiar etymologies came to hand, with no other consideration than confusion: fo r exam ple, there is the stellar system called \"Salzmanino\" which is especially dangerous because it is full of a gas like cyanic acid. Whether Gurd jieff intended any particular dig at Alexander or Jeanne de Salzmann cannot be known; quite possibly he was simply indulging his capricious sense of humor. A reader must beware of categorical statements about Beelze bub's Tales. For exam ple, Bennett declares that the name \"Karna k,\" which Gurd jieff gives to Beelzebub's spaceship, is derived from an Armenian word signifying that the body is the prison of the soul-but although this seems quite plausible, and there is in fact an Armenian root which could be bent to give this interpreta tion, Gurd jieff may just as easily have happened on the name on one of his motor trips through Brittany , the site of the famous prehistoric temple of Carnac. A story will give point to this argument. While he was writing Beelzebub's Tales, Gurd jieff was in Vichy on one of his motor expedition s. He adjourned to a backstreet cafe with his work . In search of inspir ation, he looked up and out of the window. Across the street was a shop, the name of which his companion cannot exactly remember -let us say, fo r the sake of illustratio n, Picasso et Duchamp. \"Ve-rr-y interesting ,\" sai d Gurd jieff slowly, and read out the name of the shop. His companion corrected his pronunciation . Gurd jieff ran the two names toget her, chopped off a syllable and rearranged his word . Then he started to laugh. \"Ah, Miss,\" he chort led, \"you read chapter such-and-such and you see I put-very important man, his name will be Dupicha mpo.\" Then he began to laugh again. His companion could not see the joke. Well, she asked, perhaps this was a good idea, but what was so funny? \"Don't you understand?\" said Gurdjieff. \"In New York, everyone who read will go to library, try to find name, make translation , everyone will have different interpretation of what mean this name!\" And he dissolved in laughter all over again. But if analysis of detail gives no help, the same broadly symbolic interpretation which leads to some understanding of Meetings with Re­ markable Men can be applied to Beelzebub's Tales . Once more Gurd jieff's statements are neither-one-thing-nor-the-ot her. On the other hand, it is"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"546 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE dangerous to state that the characters Beelzebub, Hassein, and Ahoon represent various human faculties and functions or various levels of develo pment. On the other, it is equally wrong to adopt the approach of Boris Mour avieff, who claims that the science fictional form of Gurd jieff's epic was inspired by the literary productions ofV. I. Kryshanov sky-a spirit medium who produced popular romances supposed to be dictated by the Earl of Roch ester which were much in demand in St. Petersburg in the late nineteenth century. Both attitudes are simplistio-- and not simple enough. Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson is about Beelzebub's instructions to his favorite grandson Hassein. \"It is not my book ,\" said Gurd jieff, \"it is Mr. Beelzebub' s,\" and he advised his pupils to address Beelzebub as \"dear grandf ather. \" The reader, theref ore, is to put himself in the position of Hassein, who is taking a trip in a psychological-space ship. There is no point in trying to follow the laborious twists and turns of his instruction; and if Beelzebub's Tales were an allegory of \"spiritual progres s,\" it would be better to turn straight to Mount Analogue or the works of T. S. Eliot. Gurd jieff's Beelzebub instructs directly, chiefly by atta cking the absurd habits of lif e on the planet Earth which he has visited on several occas ions. At various stages every one of Gurd jieff's fo llowers might have fe lt himself singled out fo r critic ism. There are chapters on the insanity of the Russians, the French, the Germans, and a huge chapter on \"Beelzebub in Americ a.\" Gurd jieff's section on \"Art\" might have been entitled \"Bad Art\" and is directed against the intellectuals and Bohemians who fo rmed such a large part of his circle; his general assaults on the medical profession and the learned ignorant are also specific denunciations of groups of people with whom he came in contact. All this is in line with Gurd jieff's expressed intention in his book: \"Mercilessly, without any compromise whats oever, to extirpate from the mentation and feeling of man the previous century-rooted views and beliefs about everything existing in the world. \" Besides destructive critici sm, Beelzebub's Tales contains a constructive aspect . In the prospectus which Gurd jieff printed in Herald of Coming Good, he refers the task of providing \"constructive\" material to the second and third series of his writings; but in Beelzebub's Tales itself, there are sufficient indications of what he intended. There is, 'fo r example, the series of chapters about the great prophet Ashiata Shiemash and the organization he proposes fo r the salvation of humanity. Ashiata Shiemash is one name fr om Beelzebub's Tales which can be directly translated (for what that is worth)-it is a Zoroastrian term signifying the \"Eternal Sun.\" In one aspect Ashiata stands for Gurd jieff himself. He is the son of a poor family, who in his seventeenth year decides to prepare himself fo r his mission of freeing the world from the illusions under which it lives. He decides -as Gurd jieff"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"A SHOR T SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAN D INQUISI TOR 547 himself elsewhere tells us he decided-to make use of the innate faculty of human conscience, the traditional virtues of faith, hope, and love being totally atrophied. The deliberations of the great prophet-like the travels of Beelzebub on Earth-provide something of the material \"for a new creati on\" which Gurd jieff intended to give in Meetings with Remarkable Men. Most importantly, Gurd jieff has a chapter called \"The Holy Planet Purgatory ,\" in which he describes the creation of the world and the institution of the laws of cosmic harmony which he expounded to Ouspensky's companions in Russia. Instead of outlining his cosmology clearly , he conceals its details beneath a welter of jargon; for example, the three fo rces which he had called affirming, denying, and reconciling are styled \"Surp-Otheo s,\" \"Surp-Skiros, \" and \"5urp-Athanatos .\" \"M ust dig dog deeper\": yet the dog would have fo und the same bone. In 1934 Gurdjieff explained his account of the Creation to Toomer who recorded the Master's comment. \"Just so I create my world ,\" he said. \"But my task more difficult than God's. God have to destroy nothing first.\" 50 what is the role of Gurd jieff's cosmology in the process, and did he believe in it himself? There is no doubt that he had made an intensive study of the various occult and religious cosmologies from which he construct ed. his own, and he most probably did believe -at least as a hypothesi s-the laws of the harmonial tradition which he had reconstructed. But this was his world-\" my world\"-and of a piece with the extraordinary atmosphere which he created around hims elf. His role playing, his hints of possessing strange powers, his conscious posturing and exotici sm-fo rmed a controlled personal environment which accompanied him wherever he went. What­ ever the psychological temperature in Paris, New York, or Chicago , the weather near Gurdjieff was always Gurd jieffian. He was not above setting the stage to help him achieve his effects. The house outside Moscow which is described in Glimpses of Truth, the apartm ent on the Bolshoia Dimitrovka of which Ouspensky speaks in In Search of the Miraculous , the entire Prieure-but especially the Study House-and at the end his Paris flat, with its glittering decora tions and its shutters firmly closed against the city: these were all isolated from the world of everyday-not sensory-deprivation chambers, but association­ deprivation chambers where the normal conditioned reflexes of humanity ceased to operate because there was no code of conduct which covered the situation in which the pupil found hims elf. When, by his contradictory behavi or, his concentrated assaults on the self-confidence of would-be followers, and his acute psychological insight, Gurd jieff had managed to destroy most of the conventions which dictated a pupil's responses, he could start his work of creation ."},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"548 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Ouspensky felt that it was impossible to tell a lie in Gurd jieff's Mosc ow flat. The narrator of Glimpses of Truth came from darkn ess into another world of color and light. The door of the Prieure was guarded-you had to ring loudly to get in-and once in, the strange combination of monastery, labor camp, and Mad Hatter's Tea-Party excluded the world beyond the Institute's walls; a world from which Gurd jieff's Citroen arrived, as James Young remarked, like an intruder fr om reali ty. Gurd jieff knew all about the practical uses of symboli sm. And the fu nction which unaccu stomed surroundings perf ormed directly fo r those who had personal contact with the Master was perf ormed in literary terms by the cosmology of Beelzebub's Tales . After destruction -of fixed association s, of vanities, both existing and nonexistent, of the whole fr ame of reference which constitutes the pupil's picture of the world- something must be put in its place . You cannot show a man that the bridge on which he is standing is built of dreams and fa ntasies without offering him a rope to cling to. This proce ss of substituting one world picture fo r another is implied in Ouspensky's title \"A New Model of the Universe .\" Ouspensky had seen the physics of Newton destroyed by those of Einstein, and the apparently solid universe reduced to para dox. He therefore worked out his \"new model\" while admitting -at least in the beginning -its proVisional nature . In the same way Gurd jieff, having destroyed the Newtonian world of inherited conditioning, erected an astonishing Einst einian universe where nothing was what it seemed, and where relati onships of cause and effect were blurred or rearranged in new patter ns. This was \"my world,\" into which the pupil might slip by imperceptible stages until he fo und himsel f controlled by a different system of va lues, able to perceive new connections, and to read meaning into previously meaning­ less operations of the cosmos. Beelzebub's Tales cannot provide any real literary sense of the alternative reality which Gurdjieff man ufactur ed, although it contains hints. This fu nction was to be perf ormed by Meetings with Remarkable Men . In that book Gurdjieff intended \"to acquaint the reader with the material required fo r a new creation and to prove the soundness and good quality of it.\" The task of giving literary fo rm to such an alternative reality was as difficult as the problem of expressing in words the preliminary stages of conf usion and destructi on, and fo r all its reada bility, Meetings with Rema rkable Men is probably even less successful than Beelzebub's Tales . The \"sense of another reali ty\" which one reviewer attributes to it does exist, chiefly because literary conventions demand some suspen sion of disbelie f. In Meetings with Remarkable Men Gurd jieff atte mpts to use the theme of his search for wisdom to weave around the reader some of the net of \"my world .\" As it turned out, Ouspensky's In"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"A SHORT SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 549 Search of the Miraculous has performed this function rather better for large numbers of people. But how is it done-how is the transition achieved? Gurd jieff explained in Beelzebub's Tales and his explanation has already been mentioned when discussing his activities as a professional hypnotis t. Significantly , it is contained in two paragraphs which were omitted even from Orage 's cyclo styled edition of THE BOOK. They were circulated among the New York groups as a separate fragm ent. Beelzebub is explaining to Hassein Gurd jieff' s new method of hypnot ism: So, my boy, when the hypnoti st, by modifying the tempo of the blood circulati on, temporarily suspends the action of the localization of their false consciousness -now the ruling master of their common pres­ ence-the sacred data of their genuine consciousness can blend freely during their \"waking\" state with the entire fu nctioning of their planetary body. If then he rightly assists the crystallization of data evoking in that localization an idea contrary to what has been fixed there, and directs the results of that idea upon the disharmonised part of the planetary body, an accelerated modification of the circulation of the blood in that part can be produc ed. Gurd jieff may have intended to convey something by his claims to be able to modify the circulation of the blood; or it may be simply a blind. The point is that he refers to a new fo rm of hypnotism which allows him to suspend \"false conscious ness.\" He then implants suggestions of a conflicting nature . In other words, he is talking about the process of destroying existing values and providing material fo r a \"new creation\" -that is, Gurd jieff's own \"new model\" of the universe. He admits that this is a form of hypno tism; but hypnotism used to counter the unperceived \"hypnot ism\" of conditio ning and conventional wisd om. At the very beginning of Beelzebub's Tales there is a section on the mecha nisms which power space ships. The Karnak is a ship of advanced design. Beelzebub and the captain of the ship reminisce about the antiquated vehicles which they knew in their youth . The captain remem­ bers how \"very complicated and cumbersome\" they were, and how their chief use was in transporting about the universe the fuel fo r their own prop ulsion. These primitive models were replaced by ships powered according to the \" system\"Of Saint Venoma. \" The principle of this drive was a method of destroying matter and thus creating a vacuum through which the ship could easily pass. There were grave drawb acks, says the captain,"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"550 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE chiefly because, although such ships worked well in \"atmosphereless spaces,\" \" when nearing some sun or planet it became real torture for the beings directing them, as a great deal of complicated manoeuvring was necessary . . . when the ships were passing near any sun or planet whatsoever, their speed of locomotion had sometimes to be reduced hundreds of times below their usual rate.\" It takes some familiarity with Gurd jieff' s symbolic methods-and also a certain amount of guessw ork-to see that he is ref erring to earlier methods for disrupting \"false conscio usness .\" In talking of planets and suns he probably means distracting influences which could so easily entice away recruits who had entered the \"world\" of the spaceship. But the system of Saint Venoma was soon superseded, Gurd jieff writes, by that of the Archangel Hariton. The great virtue of this method was that it operated best in conditions of dense matte r. The principle Gurdjieff describes is something like the jet-and the point is that this engine makes use of the material obstacles in its path to generate its power. \"The ship on which we are now fiying belongs to this system,\" remarks the capta in. The Karnak represents Gurd jieff's Fourth Way, the Way of the Sly Man. The captain describes its virtues as \"simpli city and convenience\" and Beelzebub compares it to \"perpetual motion .\" He pronounces what can safely be taken as Gurd jieff's justification fo r his technique: It will work perpetually without needing the expenditure of any outside materia ls. And since the world without \"planets\" and hence without at­ mospheres cannot exist, then it fo llows that as long as the world exists and in consequence, atmosphere, the cylinder-barrels invented by the great Archangel Rariton will alway s work . All you need, he might be saying, to practice this Method is yourself and the challenges of ordinary life. There is no need fo r the appal ling difficulties of trying to maintain an entire society based on theological princi ples. The closed world of a cult holds fast only when unchall enged by a rival system of values. Neither system bears comparison with the way of the man in the world. But for all the System's advanta ges, it is still countering one form of hypnoti sm with another; and there is no guarantee that the revised world picture has anything to recom mend it over the first. It may be that a magical or a religious view of the .universe is just as tenable as that of the secondhand car salesman. But it is no more tenable. The verdict here depends upon whether one believes that Gurd jieff took his harmonial vision"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"A SHORT SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 551 of the universe as a representation of absolute reality . Many of his followers have thought so-and have stuck in the alternative universe he proposed to them. But this is only half the story, one stage in the process . It is the error pilloried by the classic Zen story of the man who sees only the pointing finger and not the moon at which it points. In New York, Orage had his own version of this monitory tale which Toomer recorded : \"I am a signpost,\" he said, \"I indicate a way. But you do not fo llow the signpost, you fo llow the road. You are not to follow me; you are to practice the method I define .\" When the pupil has made the psychological-spa ce journey from Newto­ nian space into Einsteinian space , what comes next? However we alter the picture of the world which our inheritance has given us-by drugs and by yoga like the young Ouspensky, or by confusion like Gurd jieff and the Masters of Zen-the great temptation is to assume that the new universe is by definition more real than the previously limited world one has inhabited. Immed iately there are cries of \"higher forces\" ­ scarcely ever \"different\" fo rces or \"other\" fo rces. Our assumptions have been �ltered, that is all. The poor neophyte discovers that \"a mountain is not a mountain\" -and sometimes dashes round telling all his friends, in which case he may end up in a padded cell. Man wants to bow down to the lightning, as Gurd jieff came to be only too aware. But if he avoids this trap, he may discover when he returns that the world he has known as rigid is in fact infinitely flexible. A perception of new orderings may give a peculiar sharp ness to old orderings. Old associations may be knocked away, encrustations of spurious meaning vanish. There is a case for considering that a journey out of this world and back is a necessary intellectual adventure, whatev er verdict the return may bring; the point of t h e journey is not to impose upon the pupil an alien vision of the universe, although he will need a \"new model\" at one particular stage. For after the stages of destruction and the reconstruction of an alternative world picture, the new vision which has replaced the old must in its turn be destroyed. Its purpose is served once it has shown the pupil that there are other possibilities, not to dictate to him which of those possibilities he should pursue. It may be that he will choose a lifetime of sampling and tasting, with no definite commitment ever made. 'Tve lived thousands of yea rs,\" said Gurd jieff to Toomer in 1934. \"It is possible to know how to live thousands of years in one life.\" Gurdj ieff proclaimed that his object in the Third Series wa s to help the reader to f orm \"a '(reritable, nonfantastic representation . . . of the world existing in reality,\" and it may be significant that the book remains unfinished. For how could it help an individual to come to this personal conclusions about reality? It could at the most represent"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"552 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurd jieff's own effort. Toomer recorded Orage 's terse demonst ration of this point in his introductory remarks to one particular group. He asked his audience why they had all assembled. A: \"To hear about a new psychology .\" 0; \"What is the nature of this psychology? Whose is it?\" A: \"Gurdjieff' s.\" 0: \"No\" (the Method is Gurdjieff 's). Orage then developed the point that it was one's own individual psychology that was involved. In an essay called \"Scholarship and the Spirit\" (1928), which was heavily influenced by Orage , Zona Gale makes much of the chemical term \"allotrope .\" An allotrope of a substance is composed of the same chemical constituents rearranged so as to form a different substance. Zona Gale suggested that men should form \"the allotropes of themselv es.\" This implies that the element of chance plays a large part in the process, that the shaking up of the pupil's constituent parts is in reality no more than the rattling of the dice-box . Few of the Work teachers have been foolish enough to deny that they are engaged in an occupation which embodies an element of risk. It does not depend largely on the teacher how the proce ss eventually turns out. Gurd jieffhad to expend a great deal of energy to drive some of his closest pupils away ; but sooner or later they made the break \"\"\": and made it for th emselves. The pupil himself must escape from the alternative world with which he is presented; and this marks the entrance to a new stage in the process. In the revised edition of his memoir of Orage , Philip Mairet makes some comments which were inspired not only by Orage 's break with Gurd ji'eff, but his own parting from Mitrinovic. Once you are in a school, as in a religion, there is no other truth to live by than what it teac hes. In one sense this is even more obligatory in an esoteric school than in an established religious discipline, for here both doctri ne and method are dependent, even to the smallest details, upon the master's ipse dixit . Thus, if a pupil should be able, after training, to set up an independent group of his own, the new and the old masters will soon disown one another as heretical or untrust worthy ; for no pupil must be exposed to the temptation to play off one master's advice against anoth er's. There is elasticity in the discipline, too, but implicit obedience to the master's generally unexpected interventions is all the more burdensoPle and disturbing because it remains voluntary. A pupil may simply pack up and go, as many did from Gurdjieff: many, perhaps all, were free to come and go upon their business or other"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"A SHORT SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 553 occas ions. But upon any point that the master decreed essen tial fo r the good of the school or his own progress, a pupil was under compulsion by the fact that he had identified his hope of self-realization with the teachi ng, and the teach ing with Gurdj ieff. This is the powe rful bond which has to be broke n, in due course, if the pupil is ever to regain his individuality with a new confidence in life. The rupture can be a grim experience; it is itself an initiatory ordeal. Although the pupil, when he leaves the Master, may be an allotrope of his former self, it is not chance alone which dictates the nature of this transf ormation. The nature of Gurd jieff's Fourth Way is that it branches into different roads, and in his teach ing Gurdjieff did broadcast material with which his pupils could make their first steps down their different pa ths. Despite the assertions that the Fourth Way is a way fo r the household er, to be practiced in ordinary life, we should be aware of assuming that \"ordinary life\" retains the same significance fo r those who practice it. The conditions of ordinary life are used as a means of transf ormati on, and this must completely alter the way of the man in the world. Gurdj ieff told Ouspensky that there was no need to give up anything at the start. The Work begins as a via grad ua, an easy slope requiring no dramatic renunciations such as attend the monk's vows , no strenuous exercises like those of the fakir, no imaginative or intellectual acrobatics like those of the magician or the yogi. The teachers begin by leading their pupils along a path of extreme reasona bleness and ask them to verify everything they are told. But very soon the path gets stormier, and eventually the traveler is faced with a triple fork in the road. Like Thomas the Rhymour under the Eildon Tree, he must sit down and make his decision. One track is the religious path, the road toward God. Gurd jieff was perpetually irreverent when referring to the Deity-\"old Idiot who created such\"-and fo r all its absolutes, his System was agnostic. Once when Ouspensky was asked whether he could give a pupil religious faith, he replied \"absolutely not.\" And yet many of the people who came to Gurdjieff were in search of a God they had lost or never had. So it often happened that Gurd jieff found himself invested with divine attributes by what the anonymous writer in The Times Literary Supplement calls so aptly, \"Silly men and even sillier women .\" As this critic remarks, he became fo r some devotees the \"God-substitute, which at least on a conscious level he did not want to be.\" But fo r the less susceptible, their religious quest was an aim which Gurdjieff could use, and he helped them on their way. \"I have many sons in monasteries,\" he would rumble; and these monasteries need not all have been built of stone. The second road is that of the cultist, the pupil who finds a religion in"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"554 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE Gurd jieff's cosmology and a God in the teacher himself. These are the sheep who are content to be eaten: unfortunates who are trapped in the transf er situation and cannot extricate themselves. They have jumped from the frying pan into the fire and will sizzle into cinders. They may be quite happy as cinders but they will have been burned up. New religions are fo rmed by those who have misu nderstood, fo r the religious sheep are useful to the ones who do understand: the Grand Inquisitors ... In the second act ofT. S. Eliot's The Cocktail Party , Sir Henry Harcourt­ Reilly puts the problem of the fork in the Fourth Way as that of a straight opposition between the religious quest and a reconciliation with the world . \"Neither way is better, \" he says, \"Both ways are necessary. It is also necessa ryffo make a choice between them .\" To the character Celia, who asks to be cured \"of a cra ving fo r something I cannot find/And the shame of never finding it,\" Sir Henry replies by descri bing what is in effect the third fo rk in the way: The condition is curable. But the fo rm of treatment must be your own choice : I cannot choose fo r you. If that is what you wish, I can reconcile you to the human condition, The condition to which some who have gone as far as you Have succeeded in returning. They may remember The vision they had, but they cease to regret it, Maintain themselves by the common routine, Learn to avoid excessive expectati on, Become tolerant of themselves and others Giving and taking in the usual actions What there is to give and take. Whether the pupil goes on \"up and out\" or back into the world (but a more flexible world perhaps) or remains fixated on the operation of the Work depends chiefly on the degree of his initial desperation. Those who opt for the religious life are often very desperate people; as Sir Henry says, theirs is a way which requires \"the kind of faith which issues from Despair. \" But after their contact with the Work, they need ahother sort of discipline than that off ered by the Fourth Way. Although Gurd jieff knew a great deal about both Christian and Buddhist monastic practices, it is doubtful whether he intended his System to be a pathway to mysti cal experience . One fo rmer inmate of the Prieure told me that he remembered Gurdjieff with \"the greate st possible esteem and affection,\" and that he had found \"everything which he had been looking for at the time\" during his four years at Fonta inebleau. But he emphasized that"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"A SHOR T SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 555 he had achieved his \"peak experiences\" under the direction of another Master. Although there are reports of people attaining mystical insights under Gurd jieff s direct ion, he tended to belittle such occas ions, and he was not-so far as we know-that sort of spriritual direct or. Again it may be wondered whether this was not in the last analy sis the cause of Ouspensky's personal disillusionm ent-a disillusionment which he passed on to some of his fo llow ers. Perhaps it is true psychologicall y, spiritually , or existentially that there is \"so mething missing\" from the System. If the sights of the pupil are fixed on a very lofty goal , Gurd jieff's system may seem incomplete in the sense of spiritually incomplete. Gurd jieff's business was to help people to center on that psychological axis which Jungians call the Self, but it is evident that some of his pupils hoped he could lead them further. Those who take the way of reconciliation may continue to keep the discipline of self-observation as advocated by Ouspensk y-or they may simply plunge joyfully back into the maelstrom fr om which they had once desperately sought an exit. Gurd jieff could not control-nor did he want to-the precise allotrope which emerged from the period of conf usion. His aim, he explained , was to put a man in touch with his real consci ousness, which had been overlaid by a complex of mechanis ms. As he never tired of repeating, \"The teaching by itself cannot pursue any definite aim . It can only show the best way fo r men to attain whate ver aim they may have.\" The way in which it does this is by first fo rcing its participants to \"take serious things seriously ,\" and then conf using the program med \"consci ous\" mind to a degree at which-so the unwritten theory goes-the subconsc ious, which fo r Gurd jieff was the \"real conscious ness,\" makes contact with the upper reac hes of awar eness. What the subconscious contai ns- unless one decides that we are dealing with a communal unconsciousness or God-has nothing to do with the teac her. Once the pupil has made the necessary contact, he has fo und, in Aleister Crowle y's phrase, his \"true Will,\" his fu nction as a human being. The man who is reconciled to the world might compare the proce ss with the three stages of the first part of Orage's Method: Self -Observa tion: when you observe your mechanicality, your contradic tions, your obedience to program med commands. Experiment: when you discover the limits of what is possible within a new context. Participatio n: reconciliation with the world on a level of greater control. Or, in Timothy Leary's admonition , \"drop out, turn on, tune in:' In \"Portage Potential ,\" Toomer expresses the idea not as part of an esoteric proce ; s but as an inevitable human develop ment: There are three stages-and one must pass through all three of them to complete his cycle.

One reenters as a superior participator; and at the same time continues and advances the develo pment of himself. Does the pupil know \"who he is\" at the end of this elaborate pilgrimage ? If a new perception of relativity is all that results, it may be asked whether the game is worth the candle. But it is possible to justify the process simply as an experienc e--and an extra ordinary one. And on a moralistic level, the pupil may not know who he is-but he may have some idea of his correct address. So the secret is that there is no secret? That the entire operation is a gigantic ludibrium? The Man Who Knows does not know-or that he knows the extent of what it is possible to know and aims to educate others in his own disillusion ment. . . . \"In the present period of my life,\" Gurdj ieff wrote in 1933, \"when declining in years, after having had everyt hing to satiety that life can offer to a human being, and having been thereby fully disillusioned in everyth ing . . .\" Gurd jieff's pupils had to follow his own progress through the world of ideas and the spirit. Just as Ouspensky constructed a \"system\" out of his experience as Gurd jieff's pupil, Gurd jieff could only construct tl system out of his own experience. No pupil would reproduce exactly the resolutions, discoveries, and disillusionments which had been Gurd jieff's lot; but he would be steered by Gurd jieff's experience, directed within territory familiar to Gurd jieff-and make his foray into the other world within the context of a universe constructed by Gurd jieff from the debris of his own explorat ions. Of course, Gurd jieff's tales of his early sense of mission and his search fo r knowledge might all have been invented fo r the benefit of particular audiences-but I do not think so. The facts fit too well toget her. Gurd jieff would have searched fo r truth in Christianity, Buddhism, and perhaps also in Islam and Hinduism, as well as in the science and occultism of his day. At the beginning, he informed his pupils, he was \"psychopat hic. \" I believe that he meant this seriously. The journey of Hassein on the Karnak is a reflection of the progressive disillusionment of Gurd jieff himself. We can now date the point at which he recognized the extent of his disillusion. This is the time he spent near Yangi Hissar in 1905, after he returned to Central Asia from the Cauca sus. At the age of thirty- one, at last realizing that no one and nothing could help him to understand the meaning of existence, Gurd jieff carried out a revision of the premises on"},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"A SHOR T SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUISI TOR 557 which he had based in lif e. He then set about perf ecting a method which might allow his pupils to undergo the disillusioning process at \"an accelerated temp o.\" To say that Gurd jieff was \"fully disillusioned in everything\" does not mean that he abandoned all belief in an immemorial tradition of wisdom. But it calls in question the nature of that wisdom. In Beelzebub's Tales he declares that the original fo rms of Christianity and Buddhism have been distorted out of all recogniti on. It is true that those who talk of \"esoteric Buddhism\" and \"esoteric Christianity\" are often the prey of the most elaborate occult fantasies. But Ouspensky regarded Christianity and Buddhism as complementary, and Gurd jieff may well have seen the inner message of both religion s as very diff erent fr om either their public faces or the \"esoteric\" interpretations of the occulti sts. The most interesting pointer to the nature of Gurd jieff's \"esoteric Christianity\" is to be found in the work of a writer of the preceding generation : Feodor Dostoievsky. The central problem of Dostoievsky's view of Christianity is that of fr eed om. Gurdjieff also wanted men to be free. I think that it is impossible to doubt that fo r all his roguery, fo r all his occasionally exploitive tactic s, he was sincere in this hope. It seems probably that he was to some extent inspired by Dostoievsky's The Brothers Karama zov, which first appeared in 1880, when Gurdjieff was six. The novel is about three brothers , who represent mind, emotion, and body. Gurd jieff's first attempt to give his ideas literary expre ssion was a film scenario entitled \"The Three Brot hers,\" and only when this proved unsuccessful did he turn to Beelzebub's Tales . There is no doubt that Gurd jieff's three brothers would also have stood fo r the three centers of man, and although he claim ed that his scenario was inspired by a visit to the cinema, there was certainly some underground connection between his idea and Dostoievsky's novel. The most fa mous passage in The Brothers Karamazov is the poem projected by the intellectual brother Ivan, and known as ''The Legend of the Grand Inquisito r.\" It is here that Dostoievsky poses most cogently the problem of Christianity as a road to freedom. Gurd jieff may have conceived his mission as being to rescue the gospel of freedom from the well-intentioned perversions of the Grand Inquisitor and his brethre n: \"God, whose service is perfect fr eedom .\" Such an \"esoteric\" Christianity would know nothing of churche s, and its practi tioners would form an elite able to tolerate the prospect which repels the rest of mankind. But if from one angle Gurdjieff appears as a follower of Dostoievsky's Christ, from another he s eems to be on the side of the Grand Inquisitor . The decept ions, the ludibrium, the exasperating, meandering voyage of the Karnak, the proc ess of mystification and demystific ation-G urdjieff was"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"558 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE sometimes playing an Inquisitorial role. If Beelzebub's Tales represents a literary version of the process, Beelzebub in one sense is the Grand Inquisitor, although this role is not voluntarily assumed. Beelzebub is concealing a great deal from his grandson. Denis Saurat comments: \"One does not tell children the whole truth , one gives them carefu lly prepared parts of the truth which one hopes will fu rther the development of their souls.\" Beelzebub even tells Hassein that it is fo rbidden from above \"to communicate true inf ormation\" to a human being because this will prevent his from acquiring the knowledge born of experience which alone can fr ee him from illusions. Gurd jieff may have bee n consciously fo llowing a tradition which was known to sections of the early Church. In fact the book which bears most resemblance to Beelzebub's Tales is the Stromateis (\"Carpetbags ,\" i.e. , \"Miscellany\") of Clement of Alexandria, the saint who with Origen was one of the pillars of Alexandrian Christiani ty-that eclectic and sophisticated Christianity so frowned upon by orthodox churc hmen and which took over so much from the Traditional wisdom of antiq uity. The Stromateis, Clement declar es, \"will contain the truth mixed up in the dogmas of philosophy, or rather covered over and hidden as the edible part of the nut in the shell. For in my opinion, it is fiUing that the seeds of truth be kept fo r the husbandmen of faith and no others .\" A German critic, who disapproves of Clement as \"suspiciously Alexandr ine,\" describes the Stromateis as \"a deliberate thicket, a 'spiritual park' where fr uitful and unfruit fu l trees ar � planted higgledy-piggl edy so that the merely inquisitive and the hypocrite cannot steal the fr uit.\" Clement, he says , is concerned with \"truth as an encount er.\" Is this not exactly the arran gement and the purpose of Beelzebub's Tales? Clement claimed to have inherited a secret tradition derived fr om the Apost les, and justified the diversiona ry tactics of the Stromateis by the authority of Christ himself. \"He did not certainly disclose to the many what did not belong to the many; but to the few to whom he knew that they belonged, who were capable of receiving and being moulded accord ing to them. But secret things are entrusted to speech, not to writing, as is the case with God .\" \"Can I imagine ,\" Margaret Anderson wonders , \" ... anyone so treacherous as to betray that part [of Gurd jieff's knowledge] which can be revealed only by 'word of mouth'?\" At sever al centuries' remove we have the same tradition of an esoteric Christianity and the same tactics . The central problem of the Grand Inquisitor, as he tells Christ, is that there was a time when he too saw himself as one of the elect. Then it occurred to him that he was ignoring the meek and the humble in favor of the great and the strong who could tolerate freedo m. Once he too had stood"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"A SHOR T SPACE VOYAGE WITH THE GRAND INQUIS ITOR 559 in the desert, but fo r all his devotion to the gospel of freedom, he had surrendered to the temptation of temporal power out of compassion for humanity. He joined those whose mission was to feed the sheep. This happened with Gurdjieff and it happened with most of his fo llowers. It is only in part because of external pressures, because the Inquisitorial mentality must be strong from the first in anyone who sets himself up to teach his fe llowmen. Even if the message is freedom-inclu ding freedom from his own teaching-he knows best . He is one of the elect, the shepherds of humanity. This attitude emerges clearly in the last recorded dream of Maurice Nicoll; the \"violence\" which he felt that he must overcome arose from a fe eling that his eff orts to do good to his pupils were not appreciated . Ouspensky believed in an \"inner circle\" of humanity to which he sought admission. And Middleton Murry actually invoked the Grand Inquisitor by name in his estimate of Orage : I was always conscious of the existence of a barrier between Orage's mind and my own, which-such was his importance fo r me-I made many attempts to analyse to my satisf action. Finally, I came to the conclusion that in Orage there was an obstinate substratum of belief that there was some secret of control over the universe: a key by which one could unlock all the doors, and be a master of Power. There were veritable Masters in Tibet, fo r instance ; or, if the great ones of the earth would adopt Social Credit, the new age would begin: something, in short, of the mentality of the Grand Inquisitor in Dostoevsky's great legend. I happen to belong, by nature, to the other side. Grand Inquisitors are out of fashion with our age, and today Middleton Murry's point of view is likely to attract many more supporters than he attributes to Orage. In no age can a man who sets himself up to do good to others ob ject to being judged by the severest standar ds; and any argu ment which justifies the sometimes unpleasant tactics of Gurdjieff and his followers must be an argument of means being justified by ends.

The most obvious reason is that the victims are afraid of looking ridiculous -although as every individual · is ridiculous at almost every minute of the day, there is really no reason why such exposure should be feared. A second reason fo r the victim s' silence may be that they have been converted to a belief that the Grand Inquisitors are right; that with the passage of time they have come to value their experience. This argues that a justific ation can be found fo r the apparently brutal methods which the Work sometimes used; and that this justification goes beyond a superficial attempt to ref orm people's personalit ies. What are the ultimate objectives of the teach ers of the Fourth Way? In the last chapter it was suggested that if the fo llower of the Fourth Way avoided being trapped in the sheepf old of a new religion, two courses were open to him: that of reconciliation with the world on new terms, or on the road \"up and out\" toward divinity. Let us now leave aside all considerations of some ascent toward a divine superlative , admitti ng with Eliot that we cannot know anything of a hypothetical way by which \"the human is transhumanis ed.\" We must allow the possibility to stand-at the least as a gesture toward the ultimate puzzle of the universe, if not from any personal convicti on.

It all depends on what it is to which the individual believes he is reco nciling himse lf; and in certain senses the path toward God and that into the world are identical . As Gurd jieff s dervish appears to be saying in The S truggle of the Magic ians, belief and unbelief can ultimately be very much the same thing. And it does not seem-despite all the ac cumulated divine attri butes with which the unconscious minds of their pupils have endowed the teachers of the Work-that there is anything conventionally religious about the ethic of the Fourth Way . Gurd jieff's teaching belongs to the group of disciplines known as \"the way of liberati on ,\" which may be camouflaged by a religious fo rm fo r the reasons which will soon become appare nt. The obj ect of such disciplines is to engender a right perception of things and to encourage a reconciliation with real ity. Such a state entails the recognition that no final explana tions will ever be fo rthc oming fr om the universe, and that \"ma king the best of things\" is not a philosophy of resignati on, but the only possible creative attitude to lif e. Such an attitude of acceptance is in one sense a juvenile insight to market as eternal wisdom; but in another it might be experienced as the salvation of a soul. To the man who seeks a guru the world may well be a dark and terrible place . If he is troub led about the conditions of human existence, the nature of consci ousness, whether it is worth living, or a dozen other unimportant questions, he may be infinitely grateful fo r being brought to an understanding of the ac cepting attitude to life. And if he is in Ivan Osokin's situati on, with the revolver halfWay to his temple, it is the mercy of heaven if he happens to meet a magician . In his Psychotherapy East and West, Alan Watts demonst rates that the \"liberat ion\" at which Zen Masters or the Hindu gurus are aiming has nothing to do with the sort of gnostic liberation so beloved of occultists . \"Liberation\" is fr om the cond itioning imposed by social institutions, in particular fr om the illusion that man possesses an individual ego. The teacher perf orms his function by tr ying to make the pupil see that the pr oblems from which he imagines he is suff ering are not prob lems: they are simply the way things are. The teac her's chief weapon is the situation which Gregory Bateson has called the \"double-bind ,\" in which a person is placed in a position of apparent paradox, so that his conditioned behavior patterns break down under the strain of contradictory inf or mation . Let us say that the koan is given, \"truth is the sound of one hand clapping\"-it is, of course, incapa ble of any \"solution .\" The aim of the Master is to place the pupil in the state of double > bind; his ultimate obj ective to induce the realization that, in the concl usion of another Zen story, \"there is nothing especially to percei ve. \" In other words, the ways of liberation are based on a trick: the teachers pretend to know the answers to their students'"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"562 THE HARM ONIOUS CIRCLE questions; but what they are really doing is trying to show that the questions are not. questions at all, being based on false premises about the nature of things. The plan of the Gurd jieff proce ss fo llows tradition. At any time during the space voyage the pupil may cry \"Eur eka\" and bail out of the ship, for such journeys are of varying duration . Gurd jieff is one of the most confusing masters of liberation because he appears to have used so many different methods. What he was doing was not, as some of his followers have asserted, searching for means to adapt Eastern methods fo r Western consumption, but adapting the essence of the ways of liberation to different Western milieux. As these changed, Gurd jieff's present ation had to alter. This is because, although the teacher of the way of liberation has strictly speaking nothing to say, he must appear to say something -<>therwise no one will listen to him say nothing in his inimitable fashion .... He has two basic problems: that of exciting interest and that of asserting his authority . The pupil must be thoroughly entangled if the trick is to work, and the guru must fiat discQyer, the unconscious premises on which each student bases his life. The secret that there is no secret . The Man Who Knows does not know . In In Search of the Miraculous Ouspensky records Gurd jieff talking of the sin of \"Black Magi c,\" the sin of \"the pretence of doing\" as opposed to \"real doing.\" But in a sense, this is what Gurd jieff was doing all the time­ he was a Black Magician . Eventually the pupil might realize this-and his projections of good and evil would be set in conflict. A \"Struggle of the Magician s\" would begin in his own mind as he tried to reconcile the \"black\" and the \"white\" aspects of Gurd jieff's personality . It was another fo rm of koan . . . but at first there was only the occult genius, the master psychologist, or the remarkable teacher of dancing. The guru must be a great authority figure, although his only superiority to his students is that he realizes that the burning questions which torment them are completely unreal. But, fo r exam ple, if the pupil seems to be hoping fo r some metaphysical liberation from the condition of being human, the teacher will have to appear as if he himself has transcended the human condit ion. \"It is thus,\" Alan Watts comments, \"that the guru who has a bad temper, or who likes to smoke or drink sake, gives the impression that he indulges in these 'little vices' deliberat ely.\" Another way to put it is as a cosmic allegory : the teacher stands for God. His role is to pose the riddle of life as often as he can from every possible angle . And because the teacher must be God for the pupil, the religious camouflage is the disguise most often adopted by the teachers of the way of liberati on. By centuries of subtle maneuvers, such adepts have often persuaded the"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"OF MA STERS AND MEN 563 societies in which they work that they are in fact the pillars of conventional values. The authority of the Zen Master, the Hindu sannyasi, and the Christian priest is backed by all the sanctions .of traditional society . In the fragmented societies of the modern West, however, traditional sanctions have lost their meaning. So the guru of the Fourth Way must seem to possess the full social authority of whatever is the milieu in which he operates--quite often the appurtenances of material success. Hence the cachet of a good address in Paris, London, or New York, fo r certain contemporary practi tioners of the Work . I have even heard of one Gurd jieffian guru who demanded the loan of a pupil's Rolls-Royce to reinforce his authority . But material success may have outlived its usefulness as a general catch-all for the Fourth Way, and those in need of what the teachers of liberation have to off er may be more impressed by other sanctio ns. At the turn of the century it helped to ref er darkly to esoteric societies with which the guru was supposedly connec ted. In the 1970s the ploy was still being used, but today Amerindian sorcerers are more authoritative than Mahatmas from Tibet. Because of the lack of a commonly accepted code of social values, the Western guru has a much harder task than his Oriental counterpart . It is not only that he must constantly be seeking fo r fresh means of establishing himself as an authority . He lacks the security of a conventionally accepted framework within which to operate , and there fo re of a master-pupil relatio nship which can help the process toward a speedy concl usion. His activities will appear to be wildly inconsistent as he searches fo r a method of teaching the many different types who seek him out. Some may respond to the suggestion of hidden powers , others to the implications of material success. Eventually the whole process may become free-form-and perhaps even be sprung unsolicited on its subjects. This raises an important ethical point. In the more traditional fo rms of the ways of liberation-and in the West these may be hidden in the fo rm of psychotherapy-the \"pupil\" or student comes to the guru or therapist either because he is conscious that he has a problem or because he has a general anxiety about the nature of life. What of the pupil who is not conscious that he has a problem at all, but is simply faced with the ethic underlying the system: the illusory ego with which society provides all her childr en? He shares the fate of any pupil who approaches the Work, whether in a spirit of puzzlement, devoti on, or curio sity. What happens to him is never what he expects . In his memoir of Orage, Philip Mairet describes the inevitable disillusion which the \"esoteric pupil\" will suffer: Each pupil projects, more or less unconsciously, his own human ideal, the image of what he would like to be, upon the teacher, who must be"},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"564 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE able to sustain it. In short, the esoteric neophyte , far more than the religious one, is inspired by the hope of attai ning a higher state of being through self-knowledge and self -discipline . . . What happens to the esoteric devotee who perseveres is not, how ever, what he expects : if his init ial aspiration has been highly coloured by imaginations of acqu iring abilitities he admires or envies in the teac her, the higher knowledge he at last atta ins may be that this is what he can never do in this lif e; so that he may end up a simpler, more modest person, perhaps in a lower walk of lif e than bef ore . This is the attitude of the fo rmer devotee of \"esotericism\" who has come to see a value in the process through which he has passed. It is a tolerant and resigned attitude-the attitude which accepts the position of vict im, and continues to discover meaning in what otherwise might be remem­ bered only as a tragic mixture of fo lly and deception . But there are many reasons why the disillusioned \"esotericist\" may never attain this Olympian pinnacle of fo rg iven ess; he may fa ll along the way, may drop out of the process before it has run its course and become auto nomous, may regard the trick as a piece of knavery pure and simple. All these things have happened to pupils of the Fourth Way; and many of the attacks on Gurdjieff and his fo llowers can be explained by this incompre hension. First come the criti cisms which assume that the Work teachers were in fa ct teachi ng what they appeared to be teachi ng: that Gurd jieff was an inst ructor in \"harm onious developm ent,\" that Ouspensky taught a method of \"becoming less mechanical ,\" that Nicoll and Orage were past masters at guiding others to a knowledge of their own mac hine. Now, to say that these things were not taught by gurus of the Fourth Way would be untrue; Gurd jieff undoubtedly did believe that Western civilization encouraged an im balanced type of human being, Ouspensky did wish to attain \"cosmic conscio usne ss,\" and a pupil might learn a great deal about his minor fa ilings by impersonal self -observati on. Yet the matter of such character training is really among the fr inge benefits of the Fourth Way, and the study of personality def ects and psychological aut omatism is not conducted for its own sake , but to impose a discipline and to give the pupil an orientation which may lead to other things. If an outsider -say a reviewer of In Search of the Miraculous or a reader of Nicoll's Commenta ries-takes a Hatlan der's view of Work doct rine, he must pass a verdict which ignores the gradual unf olding and subsequent destruction of the strange \"other-world\" which it is the teacher's business to create . Because he has never been involved in the proce ss, he takes Ouspensky's record of Gurd jieff's conversation or Nicoll's weekly exhortations as \"what they taug ht, \" inst ead of as a record of the material which they used to build up their alternative frame of"},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"OF MASTERS AND MEN 565 reference. The outside critic cannot avoid this pitfall; and it also catches the pupil who begins but does not stay the course. For example, there was Richard Rees, who became editor of the Adelphi after Middleton Mur ry and remained convinced that \"Gur dj ieff unde rtook to teach his pupils how to secrete God-s tuff. \" Or there was D. H. Law rence , who maintained a tolerant distance from Gurd jieff -but stilI assumed that the Master meant what he said: In the end, if you Gurd jieff yourself to the very end, a dog that barks at you will become a dynamo sufficient to explode your universe. When you are final master of yourself, you are nothing, you can' t even wag your tail or bark. Lawrence could never have been \"tricked\" by Gurdj ieff, beca use his revolt came too ear ly. But what seemed fo r him the impossible obstacle­ the fu ndamental unnaturalness of the Gurd jieff Method-is a basic charac­ teristic of the Fourth Way, and one which it shares with the other ways of liberat ion. The pupil is directed to do something agai nst nature ; the ascetic must mortifY the flesh which cries out fo r care and atte ntion; the Zen student contemplates an insoluble para dox; the yogi studies the universe as an interplay of cosmic principle s. Then-s nap! The absurdity of the activity strikes him and he realizes that he cannot subdue the workings of his animal orga nism, that reality is an insoluble problem and that, to paraphrase Thomas Carly le's words to the lady who told him that she could \"accept the univer se,\" \"by God, he'd bett er.\" \"Man cannot remember himsel f, \" said Gurd jieff -and directed his pupils to try. \"Ma n is mechanical ,\" he said-and at once the neophytes attempted to nurture an infant superhumanity. Their lives became more and more stilted, more and more unnatural , until at last they were faced with the loss of their hum anity-e ven of their lives-altoget her. Colin Wilson argues that it is at this point that the Outsider, the religi ous misfit, may have his moment of illumination. The threat of death animates his sleeping will, and he realize s that \"he wants more life, not less.\" Wilson's examples are Ramakri shna and the Buddha: two extraordinary human beings endowed with the capacity fo r sainthood . It is perhaps here-at the furthest attenuation of life- that the Fourth Way may lead its followers to the vision of life abundant. For the others, they have reached the fork in the way, the obstacle which they cannot surmount, the d e cision that, if they cannot attain whatever ideals they had unconsciously harbored, they must reconcile themselves to the world. But instead of realizing that this is exactly one of the objects of the teacher-d.id not Gurd jieff call his Inst itute a \"workshop fo r spoiled"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"566 THE HARMON IOUS CIRCLE automobiles\" -the automobile may now realize that its engine is working as well as ever it will and may even backfire in the face of the mechanic who has decoked it. The sensation of having had as much as one can take-and not merely from a personal relati onship but from opposing oneself to an implacable universe- may produce a sharp about -face, and if the pupil fo rgets the state in which he approached the teach er, he may fe el quite justified in accusing his former idol of defrau ding and deceiving him, of taking his money and wasting his time. Of course, he will be partly right. Imagine the extent of Ouspensky's chagrin when he realized that the man fo r whom he had sacrificed a promising career and allowed himself to be trapped in Bolshevik Russia was to all intents and purposes a fraud. If the pupil gives himself time to consider, he will realize that his own lunatic unconscious has trapped him, and not his guru. He may become grateful to the man who has shouldered the difficult burden of his projections, and returned him to life alive and kicking; although even Ouspensky had to separate Gurdjieff and the \"ideas\" before he found it possibile to fo rgive his teach er. But the newly \"awoken\" p, upil may not give himself time for thought, and the shock of disillusion results in the second largest group of criticisms of Gurd jieff's Method. What such critics are really attack ing are their own fo rmer selves. Alan Watts writes about the tricks of liberat ion: The technique will naturally seem to be dishonest. But this is a conscious and deliberate dishonesty to counter an unconscious and otherwise inera dicable self-deception on the homeopathic principle of similia similibus cu rantur - likes are cured by likes. Set a thief to catch a thief. Speaking of mutual recognition between those who are liberated, a Zen Buddhist text says: When two thieves meet they need no introductio n: They recognise each other without questi on. Did the Sly Man not say repeatedly that he might have stolen the System? And this leads to another of the remarkable characteristics of Gurd jieff s Me thod. If the pupil is to enter the \"other world\" cl'eated by the Master, he must be encouraged to regard his teacher as a great authority figure. Yet, if the teacher of the Gurdjieff Method is doing his job, he will at the same time be planting the seeds of future doubt in the pupil's mind; hence the ambiguous impression which Gurdjieff made on many of those who encountered him. While encouraging the pupil to regard him as a great magician , the Master should be telling him all the time that he is cheati ng."},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"OF MAST .ERS AND MEN 567 There is a good exam ple of Gurd jieff doing just this in Kathryn Hulme's Undiscovered Country . He spends considerable time instructing her in breathing exercises -then devotes an equal period to mocking her for doing as she is told. Surely she doesn't really believe that she can extract the substances from the air which are necessary to create immortality? She does, of course, and bravely records the fact in her book. When the pupil \"wakes up\" his first reaction may be anger, his second a reluctant acceptance of the situation. This may be followed by a different sort of anger: an overpowe ring irritation at himself fo r having been so stupid. Here there is a definite danger that the newly \"awoken\" person will need some way of exorci sing his vindictiveness; that because he has been through the process hims elf, he will then decide that it is his vocation to put others through it in turn. The guru-game is self-perpetua ting, and the motives of Grand Inquis itors are always a little suspect. Although they may believe that they are acting fo r their quarry's own good, their compassion may well be mixed with an unrecognized wish to see others wriggle where they have wriggled before. The winnowing of the unconscious which results from the process may be incommunicable in the strict sense -although it could be described. Perhaps only the passage of time will show the victim whether or not the episode has been of value; and the experience of each pupil will undoubtedly be diff erent not only in the obvious external ways, but in the interior psychological results. It is possible to make a ground plan of the process, but there can be no real comparison of notes. It is therefore impossible to judge when the process is \"successful ,\" and unfairly easy to say when it has gone wrong. The cases of suicide which are from time to time linked with the Work do not prove a great deal. The unstable people attracted to \"occult\" theories include nume rous potential suicides. On the other hand, the teacher must be considered responsible fo r any pupil whom he accepts and he must be aware that he will attract people in dangerous psychological states. The teacher should be able to monitor his pupils with the skill of a psychological technician ; he has to know precisely what pressures to apply and when; he must be an exceptionally sensitive person, and he should certainly have undergone lengthy training in the skills needed by a manipulator of the Fourth Way. Little is known about how the Work teachers are trained except the famous adage, \"to learn more you must teach ,\" and a rumor recalled by Louis Pauwels that ) t takes seven years to make a gr oup leader. There is no doubt that the Gurd jieff groups are conscious of their responsib ilities. Nonetheless things do go wrong: they went very wrong fo r Gurd jieff himself on a number of occas ions, and they have certainly gone"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"568 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE equally wrong fo r a number of his followe rs. This is not condemnation; merely a warning that although the Fourth Way may be an enlightening psychological adventure , it is also danger ous. It is dangerous becau se, although its practitioners claim that they warn prospective neophytes of the suffering which awaits them, they can never warn them sufficiently. For the Work to work, the pupil must be hit from his blind side; indeed part of the proce ss will be to point out that he has a blind side. Gurd jieff himself had an exaggerated disrespect for direct instruction ; he was so busy creating conf usion and playing his various roles that at times he seems rarely to have explained anything at all. The Work operates by surprise attack, and if this attack is overdone, it may merely shock the pupil into a position of dependence which he or she will never be able to break. There must have been numerous unfortunates tempor arily or semi-permanently warped fo r ordinary life by their experiences in the Work . There should be no psychological snobbery here. No one can stand up to an astutely conducted campaign to implant in him the sense of an alternative reality . If the teacher cannot attach the pupil to him, he risks the departure of his charge in a reconditioned but not rehabilitated state . This is eqUivalent to driving someone mad and renouncing responsibility for it. The Fourth Way is based on violence ; and this is the most serious objection to its method s. Such violence might be justified by the specious counterar gument used by some fashionable anarchists: that the tacit \"violence\" of the prevailing system-in this case an existential situation and the conditioning of social institu tions�an only be corrected by violence in its turn. Violence is used to create the \"other world \"; violence is used to shock the pupil into realizat ions; it is by violence that he escapes from his imprisonment. If the degree of fo rce necessary is not gauged very accurately, either the proce ss will be ineffective or there is a risk of destroying the pupil altogeth er. Mouravieff sums up the possible adverse eff ects of the Fourth Way when its techniques are wielded by an incompetent or unlucky instructor. \"A dissolution of the personality ,\" he writes, \"is usually the result. Malaise, moral depression, black pessimism, persecution-mania are the symptoms of this progre ssive dissolution. In the gravest cases, this can lead to a complete state of imbalance leading to the denial of the Self, which opens the way to suicide .\" Ouspensky probably felt the truth of this criticism and modified Gurd jieff's methods accordingly. Maurice Nicoll further sugared the pill with a religious topping. But this process of watering down Gurd jieff's strong medicine has produced an appare ntly inevitable parad ox: that although the strongest objections to the Fourth Way turn on its use of violence, efforts to make it more charitable may simply increase the number of \"sheep\" who become trapped in the alternative world . If we are to admit any value at all in the whole \"liberating \" proce ss, we must also"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"OF MASTERS AND MEN 569 admit that its most violent versions -although they may result in the greatest tragedies-may also produce the greatest effects. Such a verdict seems to imply approval of the ethic behind the ways of libera tion. But is this merely the quietest, Taoist \"way of the straw dogs\" which sees the universe as game or theater and counsels detac hment from the gaudy show as the only salva tion? If we are to believe Alan Watt s, liberation is an even more specific state of being, and implies release from the duality of ego and universe. \"There is,\" he write s, \"nothing occult or supernatural in this state of conscio usness, and yet the traditional methods fo r attaining it are complex, diverge nt, obscure, and, fo r the most part, extremely arduous .\" The harmoniously developed man, who feels himself in tune with the cosmos, who \"goes with the flo w,\" accepts his own nature and that of his environment, is not generally considered as an active creature; not that he is particularly inactive , but that the sound and fury which result from the striving of the ego to impose its patte rns on the universe are experienced as irrelevant because they are seen to stem from an identification with an illusory self. As Jacob Needleman comments: \"A system of serious ideas helps a man to become still.\" Yet it could be maintained that the whole concept of the Man of the Way is itself based on an unperceived illusion, which may have arisen because the majority of people who become interested in the ways of liberation are instinctive world renounce rs, driven from a normally active life by tempor ary setbacks or a desire fo r a permanently contemplative existence. It is not possible to argue about the sense of \"cosmic conscious ness,\" \"universe as organism ,\" or \"loss of ego.\" This is a sub jective and quite nonmyst ical experience ; and the Work has certainly led people toward such a realiza tion. But whether the experience is in any sense \"objective,\" or what should be a man's relation to it are other questi ons. Even if a man is able to live out the philosophy of the universe as theater, he must see that innum erable roles are necessary in the theater of the universe. There can be no specific concl usion to the proce ss; as by the end of his instruction the pupil's decisions have become his own, and he no longer inhabits a universal situation . His conscious life is in fact only just beginning, and although the question \"what happens next?\" cannot be strictly answered, it is the most important question to ask. Gurd jieff dealt in the mechanics of human illusion. Sometimes he dealt in the general illusions, but the most important part of his work was concerned ·with those illusions which are mdividual . He never claimed that he was able to give a pupil knowledge which he or she did not already possess; but said that all he did was to arrange the pupil's knowledge in a new way.

Such minor observations may serve as an aid to greater objectivity, but the relativiza­ tion of self is an existential experience and involves the total organis m. As a greater and more comprehensive detach ment becomes possible, it is open to the individual to decide how extensive he feels that this should be. How will he take the theatrical universe? On the terms of the mystics, of those who are Puritans in the renunciation of their illusory ego-or in a more Nietzschean way like E. R. Eddison? For Eddison accepts the notion of the universe as theater, and yet finds it quite possible to will an acceptance of the play in progre ss. He suggests that there may be \"no necessity fo r these peculiar and (to us) inconvenient arrange ments, but that-fo r the mo­ ment-they are amusing .\" He explains the fact that \"they are far from amusing to us here and now\" as a failure of human faith in any real immortality . But it is possible to adopt his attitude even if we believe that death is absolute. Watts and the semi-Theosophical writers of the ways of liberation tend toward the Puritan interpretatio n. They approve of men of the Tao, detached and unassertive; men who recognize the illusory nature of the ego and are content to allow themselves to be \"existed in.\" Yet if the ego is such a harmful human attribute, why was it developed? The answer is that most tasks-am ong them the most essential tasks of physical survival-d emand the sensation of 'T' to carry them through. A man who really and in every . particular lived out an ego-less philosophy would soon not trouble to fe ed himself; and societies pervaded by such passive philosophies are the static societies, in whose conditions an attitude of acceptance is the only way to approach an intolerable existence. It has often been remarked that Taoism was developed in a China where life was all but insupportabl e; where wars and natural disasters were everyday currency, and where a stoical accep­ tance of these inevitable tragedies was an invaluable aid to survival. The unsettled condition of the contem porary West has seen a flight to the consolations of Oriental wisdom, and there is no doubt that the success of a discipline like that of the Work has come about partly in response to human necessity. It would be a hard man who condemned out of hand all such helpful philosop hies. Yet to Western minds they will always have about them something of the effete. To be able to maintain an attitude of detach ment in the face of great personal loss or hardship is a faculty to be envied. But to a man who wants to lead an active life, it will seem to be no more than a useful weapon in his psychological armory, to be brought out on occasion. By all means allow your \"ego\" to dissolve if it is overwhelmingly assailed by misfortune. But you will waste the very short time at your disposal if you live semi­ permanently in a dispersed conditi on. If you want to make the most out of"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"OF MASTERS AND MEN 571 the play in progress-and for \"you\" there will be no other play-you should collect about you the shards of some serviceable persona as soon as possible, literally pull yourself together and jump back into the ring. You may have learned in the Work that you can play many more roles than you had ever imagined were possible for you-but unless you propose to devote your life to contemplation, you had better get out there and play them. And-w hatever the arguments of Watts and the proponents of a \"unified field of consciousness\" -you do appear to possess an organism which has to be manipulat ed. From time to time you may decide that, fo r example, your vision of the world is situated inside you rather than outside, that there is in fact no separation between observer and observed. But unless you are a very unusu al person, your prevailing mode of consciousness is liable to maintain the illusion of separation . Even assuming that you could ever be certain that this was an illusion and not just anothe r metaphor, you would still have to operate within the convention. Even an illusion of self creates the reality . Let us suppose that we make our bow in the direction of the anima mundi and obtain the taste of a \"liberated consciousnes s.\" What we do with it will be entirely a matter of temperament and vocat ion. (It might be more accurate to say, what it does with us.) It is open to the individual player to rejoin the game with renewed zest and vigor. This may also be the Tao, the way \"which is not the constant way.\" If the game he is playing requires a high degree of ego-ide ntification , the individual may even choose to regard the decision to play it as his own. Although the man who chooses \"the way of the straw dogs\" may be purer, calmer, more \"in touch with himself' than the man who choo ses to play another game, other games must be playe d, perhaps with great energy, apparent submersion in events, and ultimate futility in the eyes of the philosop her. We are presented with a version of Pascal's \"Wag er,\" and the dice are loaded in favor of the man of action . If the philosopher of the Ways is \"wron g,\" the game-player will be \"rig ht.\" But if the philosopher is right, the gll' 'A-player must be right anyway. He cannot lose. Much of this history of the Work has concerned pathological material both in Gurd jieff's and in the clini cal sense of the term. This is because in order to rid a pupil of his delusions, the teachers of the Fourth Way have first to elicit a full expression of them , then to encourage the pupil to act upon his illusory concept of the world until he discovers his error . And because the teachers have to absorb the pro jections of succe ssive genera­ tions of pupils, their images ar e inflated beyond all measure. Kathleen Raine has compared the relationship of Ouspens ky to Gurd jieff with those of Trotsky to Lenin and Jung to Freud. She remarks that \"the spiritual statu re, or spiritual pride of these two men, invites ambitiou s comparison .\""},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"57 2 THE HARMONIOUS CIRCLE To some extent she is correct: both Gurdjieff and Ouspensky sometimes nodded. The guru may occasionally believe in hims elf. But what Miss Raine is really criticizing are the accumulated projections of Work pupils, which compose the icons of Gurd jieff and the other teachers fo r posterity . Much of what is visible in the story of the Harmonious Circle is madness or the result of madness; deliberately induced so that it should destroy itself. Much may appear to be madness which is not so in fact; fo r how can a teacher of the Fourth Way write books about Gurd jieff without reinforcing the legend of the source of his own authority? There are also madnesses which the Work has encouraged despite itself. But all this-and numerous reservations about the methods of the Work -should not be allowed to hide the fact that underneath the apparent lunacy lies a technique of extraordi­ nary interest. The achievements of Gurdjieff and his fo llowers are large enough to escape devaluation by talk of \"Gurd jieff's mission\" or \"a new age.\" The Work is a method of higher education which has been of great benefit to large numbers of people. If we consider it as \"psychodram a,\" it has an enormous advantage over all other fo rms in that fo r a considerable time the pupil may not suspect that the situations in which he finds himself are manufactured. Far from being inhuman, this is the Work's final justifica­ tion. It removes the possibilit y-which invalidates all other fo rms of psychodram a-that the patient will respond in an artificial manner to situations which he knows are themselves artificial . Because the teacher's knowledge is unknown , his powers infinite, and his manif est nature elicited by his pupil's unconsci ous, the situations in which a pupil is placed are more real to him than those he encounters day by day. As soon as he begins to suspect the true objective of the process-he is waking up. The enlightenment offered by the Work can, of course, be as easily obtained in the course of ordinary life. Gurd jieff's objection was that it cannot be obtained quickly enough. The Sly Man takes \"a little pill,\" and saves years of useless agony chasing daydream s. But it is also true that Gurdjieff, as Arnold Keyserling says, \"described Hell.\" We do not all of us live all the time in the nethermost region s. And it cannot really be argued that if someone approach es a teacher of the Fourth Way, he is automatically in need of help: for simply by practicing as an \"esoteric teacher,\" the guru creates the impression that there is something to be learned. As such he is a gigantic irrelevancy, a creator of sleep rather than wakefu lness, and the chief enemy of his own function. On the other hand, he might reply that to disabuse a person of the illusion that he can learn from anyone at all was only the next step in a proce ss of awake ning which had already proceeded some way in the course of nature .

Some time ago we left him posing as a scribe contemplating the mysteries of the Christian Church as interpreted by Origen. In Ptolemy's library at Alexandria he has set down his pen at the end of the last roll of vellu m. For a moment he toys with the idea of shuffiing the different sheets, chop ping them in odd pieces and handing them in a bag to those who would have read his book. There would be a certain faithfulness in that, although little practical ity. He sighs and begins to gather up the vellum sheets. He does not want to encourage anyone to enter the Fourth Way; but if a person is set on the encounter, he cannot prevent them. If this is abdica tion, it is the abdication which is always the only honest answ er. In the corridors of the library at Alexandria it is dark and twilight-col ored. Figures hurry along with a padding of sanda ls, and sometimes the scribe bumps into them. Glancing through a door he sees the stars are out, and beneath them the variety and promise of the night. Suddenly he laughs. As if his own opinions mattered to anyone but himse lf. Like Pilate in the Christian books he has just been reading, the scribe mentally washes his hands. He steps through the doorway and out of the cloistered gloom. On through the world outside.
