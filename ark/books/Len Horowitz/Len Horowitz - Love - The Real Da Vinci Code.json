“Reveals the Source Code for unleashing creative genius.” LOVE The Real Da Vinci Code Horowitz LOVE The Real Da Vinci Code Horowitz"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" D a Vinci’s teachers included Plato, Pythagoras, and Vitruvius, each a master of musical-mathematics, architecture, and creative lan - guage. From their research, Leonardo tapped into the core creative sounds of the universe, or the “Master Matrix.” This is called the “Kingdom of Heaven” in religious circles. This isnpired Da Vinci’s creative genius, prophetic vision and “Universal Man” (Vitruvian Man) hypothesis taught in this self-development guide. The precept that the “Renaissance Man” is reachable in each of us is what Leonardo epito - mized and this book proves. LOVE The Real Da Vinci Code details the principle that language is foremost a creative technology. All languages, and the sounds of music, are based on math. English for instance, has letter/number equivalents or an alpha-numeric code. Da Vinci is known to have written “back - words,” or encoded many manuscripts with reversed writings. He did this, according to the stunning evidence revealed herein, to compensate for the strict conditions of his time—the Dark Ages—from whence he lead the Renaissance. Today, his knowledge and this creative technology is urgent for a planet in desperate need of visionary leaders and people to engage a Spiritual Renaissance. LOVE The Real Da Vinci Code explains Da Vinci’s greatest secrets and provides simple exercises to expand brain function and “heart–mind” connection to empower future vision, spark creative talents, and gener - ate genius in the arts and sciences. This knowledge provides the secret sacred wisdom with which to optimize success in life, rapidly fulfill personal and career goals, and spiritually engage the “grand unification” of man and nature. Divinely- directed love, the free flow of energy including money, and your call to service will help facilitate the greatest global transformation in history. Your opportunity here is much like the one Bill Gates had before the beginning of Microsoft. His exclusive knowledge keyed a revolution in communications and computer science. LOVE The Real Da Vinci Code puts you on the ground floor of revolutionizing everything “on Earth as it is in Heaven.” LOVE The Real Da Vinci CODE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" D id you know there really is a Da Vinci code? A secret sacred code that inspires creative genius and prophetic vision. Th is empowering code was missing from Dan Brown’s famous novel and movie, Th e Da Vinci Code . Th e fact is, these truths are so freeing that some people don’t want you to access this “Master Matrix” to creative genius. In LOVE Th e Real Da Vinci Code , Harvard trained researcher, Dr. Leonard Horowitz, makes an unprecidented contribution. Honored by the World Organization for Natural Medicine as a “World Leading Intellectual,” the award-winning author of sixteen books has now cracked the real Da Vinci code.

Breaking the Code of Da Vinci I n June 2006, during a trip to South Africa, while confronted with my inability to alter the course of AIDS history, I asked our Creator for reassurance concerning my perceived insignificance. An inner voice replied saying, “You have a very important role to play in the great healing of the nations.” Then, a vision of Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man spontaneously captured my imagination. In that instant the Cre - ator showed me the universal technology inspiring creative genius for recreating our planet and solving the AIDS crisis and every other problem confronting the world today. The technology governing spiritual power to recreate ourselves in the image of God was included in this gift of insight. The Vitruvian Man, I realized, was a cryptograph mapping God’s core creative technol - ogy.

No one has difficulty believing and con - ceiving farming. Yet it seems to be difficult for peo - ple to believe that when they give of their finances, God will do the same thing, but He does.” Jesus’s adversary turned apostle, Paul, wrote in II Corinthians 9:6-8, “But this I say, He that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.” Every man according to the purpose in his heart, should give; “not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.

Facts About Creative Mathematics L eonardo da Vinci was incredibly prophetic and precisely visionary primarily as a result of having received a “Master Code” for applied wisdom. This code had been passed down through the ages. Da Vinci’s heroes, Plato and Pythagoras, were privy to it. “The Lost Temple Code” or “Genius Code” demystifies the Creator’s primary laws of creation. It advances the world’s most powerful creationistic technology. The real Da Vinci code is the Source Code for enlightenment, unleashing human genius, and the creative power to manifest miracles in the real world . As a result of obtaining this knowledge, the Renais - sance Man habitually encoded his research notes and wrote backwards! Why? Not simply for secrecy, although this has been alleged by many scholars. He wrote “back words ” because of his knowledge of the creative dynamics of language, its underlying po - larity or mirrored mathematics, and the impact of balancing left/right brain function. To be optimally creative, intuitive, and resourceful, you need to balance, integrate, and develop both hemispheres of your brain. Your left brain is more rational and scientific. Your right brain is consid - 15"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ered more imaginative and intuitive. Developing and integrating both sides of your brain, so that they both work together, is central to learning creative language, processing information, and receiving wis - dom for life mastery. In fact, everything in the universe is based on math. This includes the creative power of language. Lan - guage is math because sound is electromagnetic frequencies, and that is math. Language and sounds are heard because they vibrate at certain rates called Hertz frequencies, or cycles per second. Your brain perceives these energized vibrations, this math, much like your ears hear music from vibrations. Your brain interprets these messages according to your programming, that is, your neurology and memory circuits formed from life experiences. Much like 1950s or 60s music triggers memories for those who lived them, the ancient math presented here can trigger knowledge or wisdom from times long gone and also forthcoming. Future vision is due to the proven concept of space/time relativity, which is also based on simple mathematics and laws of physics you are about to consider. So math, as you will increasingly integrate in this interactive program, is the basis of everythinging. 16 Horowitz"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Magic of Math in Language Each letter of the alphabet carries a certain frequen - cy of sound or energy.

According to acoustics and linguistics scholars, a language’s alpha-numerics, and ability to affect hu - man consciousness, are two characteristics of sacred languages such as Hebrew and Sanskrit. Da Vinci studied the musical-mathematical teach - ings of architectural masters including Pythagoras, Plato and Vitruvius. He applied the encoded alpha- numeric ancient sacred languages during work and play to expand his capacity to access the mathemati - cal Matrix of space/time. This is detailed in Chapter 14. From his study and practice, The Renaissance Man was able to access the creative power available in the Matrix—also called the “Kingdom of Heaven” in the religious world.

To support this thesis, I quote from expert Graham Pont’s outstanding research report, “Philosophy and Science of Music in Ancient Greece: Predecessors of Pythagoras and their Contribution,” published in Nexus Network Journal (vol. 6, no. 1; 2004). This peer-reviewed scholarly periodical delves into the mathematics of music, other creative arts, and the sciences: 18 Horowitz “[T]he Pythagorean vision of the living cosmos—or Plato’s ‘World Soul’—has reappeared in new vitalist theories, . . . The modern world-view and its vast astronomical time- frame have changed our conception of humanity itself, . . .

Plato’s model here is both musical and geometrical; 729 decodes to 9 as you will soon learn. “Similarly [Ernest] McClain decoded many other musi - cal allegories and discovered the meaning of some in - credibly large numbers in Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, and Hebrew texts.

As strange as this may seem, civilizations are built on the musical-mathematics of language. More strange than this, some Western languages, such as English, have been alpha-numerically reversed . Given this knowledge, to reverse his mixed math - ematical messaging affecting brain function, Da Vinci wrote , or “backwords.” He made it a game. With this heart for fun and fundamentals—this balanced orientation, expanded mathematical mind, and super-charged neurology— he gained superior intuitive reception, prophetic vision, and many masterful skills.

LOVE The Real Da Vinci CODE 20"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Chapter 6. Important Da Vinci Definitions T o cement this language lesson in your mind con - sider these definitions. According to historians, Da Vinci was a master of “polymath,” “polyhistor,” and “mathema.” Polymath sources from the Greek word polys , mean - ing “much,” or “great in quantity;” and mathese meaning “learning.” So a person who excels in mul - tiple fields, particularly both arts and sciences is a master of polymath. Polyhistor is a synonym for polymath. In fact, his - tor and math mean the same: “knowledge, learn, or learned.” Histor implies erudition and wisdom. Erudition means “the scholarly achievement from instruction and reading followed by assimilation and contemplation that efface all rudeness; smoothes- away all the raw and untrained incivility. It is the depth, polish, and breadth that is applied to educa - tion.” The word education, derives from the Latin word educare which means to “lead out from within.” The word history, or histor with the “e” symbol for energy, implies knowledge of energy and the math - 21"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"ematics fundamental to energetics. Both of these are timeless, eternal, and fundamental to everything. Philomath means “a lover of learning.” Plato and Aristotle defined mathema as relative to disciplina (discipline); doctrina (learning the fundamental laws governing everything); and cognitio (cognition) or understanding the universe and the fundamental mathematical basis for the cosmos. These philoso - phers, and their many disciples, considered math - ema in terms of education; which included arithme - tic, geometry, astronomy, and music. Leonardo da Vinci is quoted as saying: “There is no certainty where one cannot apply any of the math - ematical sciences.” Universal certainty, divine/hu - man unity, and co-creativity is established by math.

It is like a letter that has been sent to us from a hundred miles off, and in which the writer’s mind speaks to us.” Let Yah speak to you this week through signs and wonders in nature.

Comparing double helix DNA to “the uni - verse as a double helix on the logarithmic line,” he concluded, “the genetic code itself is a product of the Global Standing Gravitational Wave = time wave.” (See Figures 1 and 2.) Waves flow according to mathematical law, in fact, the Law discussed herein. I have capitalized Law so that you will know this is not a lesser law. It is the Supreme Law directing everything.

From mi - croscopic bacteria and cell parts to macrocosmic celestial bodies and galaxies, all matter crystallizes in special energy zones within this math.

Balanced brain function, you recall, was needed for your “Grand Commu - nion.” In the forthcoming exercises, the 3s, 6s, and 9s are shown to reflect each other and intermingle.

Its bend is predicated on the shifting of numbers 3, 6, and 9. Each place and time the grand wave hits the “light horizon,” or virtual cosmic wall, its refraction shifts the Pythagorean trinity—3, 6, and 9 (or energy portal) positions—by a factor of “In(6).” “In(6)” also relates to the Book of Genesis account of universal creation “in 6 days.” Numbers are sacred symbols—secret messages about the “Cosmic Circle” spiraling to Earth from a spinning Heaven. “As above, so below.” Accord - ing to Müller, all of this occurs along the universe’s logarithmic line as determined mathematically and experimentally.

Among his dying words, Pythagoras is reported to have recommended monochord instruction to his disciples. Plato is believed to have done the same in his addendum to his Laws, called the Epinomis . This instrument, it is said, holds the keys to understand - ing the workings of the universe. The title, Epinomis , references the most important or highest value numbers. It is the only work in the entire body of Plato’s productions that specifically addresses the importance of harmonic mathematics and mathematical ratios. According to expert Graham Pont, “the harmonic analogia or tuning module of 6:8::9:12 [Epinomis 991a-b],” is centrally important. “Analogia means, ‘ equality of ratios ’ or ‘proportion,’” The word shares similar roots with the terms analysis, logic, and anal - ogy or similarity. Pont wrote, “the analogia is the module or system of whole-number ratios that gives Chapter 13  Monochord Mathematics  and the Macro/Microcosm 83"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"the ‘divisions of the monochord,’ the precise points at which the vibrating string can be stopped with a movable bridge, to sound the ‘fixed’ or fundamen - tal intervals of the musical scale, the octave (2:1); the fifth (3:2); the fourth (3:4); and the major tone (8:9). [Once again, t]he integers 6, 8, 9, and 12 are the smallest whole numbers with which the sym - metrical system of interlocking ratios—the natu - ral framework of the ancient and modern diatonic scales—can be expressed.” The exercise you com - pleted in the last section reflects this “symmetrical system of interlocking ratios.” As already mentioned, the whole note in music is written as an oval. It looks like a zero on its side. When in the middle of a line of music it looks just like a circle cut in half like the drawing you created in Chapter 11, Exercise 1b. To reiterate, this symbol obviously gave rise to the 3, 6, 8, and 9 set of special creative numbers. The oval or circle also relayed the concept that the universe is composed of two equal and opposite parts—an “equality of [male and fe - male] interlocking ratios.” This was symbolized by the phallus and challis halves of the equally-divided circle. 84 Horowitz"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Symbolically then, the zero (0) cut in half, like the eight (8), relays the concept of there always being two halves to one wholeness or unity. The cut, or middle dividing line, (like Ø) represents the fact that opposites are really part of the same circle. This circle represents the alpha and the omega (the beginning and the end) that our Creator character - izes Himself as being to Moses in the Book of Exodus . In a circle, the beginning is also the end. This relates energetically to the concept mentioned in Chapter 3 that giving, or tithing, is the same as receiving. The seeming opposites are interdependent, operating cybernetically, or energetically looped, by a spinning circular monochord. Here is another way of contemplating this universal freeing truth. Polarity exists for everything, and ev - erything and nothing are really the same. How so? If you were everything, like the Creator that mani - fests into all creation, then there would be nothing else. So everything and nothing are like opposite sides of the same coin. If one side disappears so must the other. Likewise, if one side manifests, so must the other. 85 LOVE The Real Da Vinci CODE"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The aforementioned duality and polarity relates to the circular monochord as well. This circular instru - ment, according to authorities, played into existence the basis for all experience and existence. In The Pythagorean Plato (1978) Ernest McClain discusses the fundamentals of tuning and features the circular application of the monochord string. I suggest you consider this along with the importance of tuning into the “Circle of Life.” If you were to commune with the frequencies of the monochord, how might this affect your health, well-being, and prosperity? “As above so below.” If the cosmos springs from a sacred circle of sound, the monochord, Heaven must present musically to Earthlings. McClain explained that the monochord tones can be graphed geometrically, or circularly. This idea of graphing sound, laying specific tones out on a circu - lar line, is precisely what I did when I first conceived of the “Perfect Circle of Sound.” The implications of this knowledge are broadly transformational. Taken to the next level, McClain’s text examined seven of Plato’s numerical allegories as they relate to his theories of music underlying poli - tics, empowered governors, and governments. It has 86 Horowitz"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"been reported that the governmental constitutions of Athens, Callipolis, Atlantis, and Magnesia, accord - ing to McClain, corresponded to four different tun - ing systems, or musical temperaments.

Linking musical-mathematics to civilizations past and present, Pont examined the “Predecessors of Pythagoras” in relation to architecture, especially focused on temple art. He noted “their connection with science and music.” In the “grandest monu - ments that man has built in imitation of the heaven - ly order,” monochord musical-mathematics is appar - ent.

Historically, archaeologists discovered pentagrams on Mesopotamian potsherds dating back to 3500 BC. Pentagrams appear in art from ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Reference to the pentagram in Christian writings stems from Hildegard of Bingen. The twelfth century Benedictine nun perceived the pentagram, as Da Vinci did in creating The Vitruvian Man, as the central symbol of the micro/ macrocosm, reflecting Earth in the Divine plan according to the Creator’s image. Hildegard wrote the pentagram metaphorically represented human nature with five obvious senses – sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing; and five extremities – two ams, two legs, and a head. And, because humans were made in the Creator’s image, she viewed the pentagram as a sacred geometric godly symbol. Christians later saw the pentagram as depicting the five wounds of Christ and, because of this, the symbol was believed to guard against evil.

Peter Un - derwood’s dictionary definition of Baphomet states: “a deity worshipped by the Knights Templar, and in Black Magic as the source and creator of evil; the Satanic goat of the witches’ Sabbath and one of the names adopted by Aleister Crowley.” According to Templar History Magazine, Templars simply see this image as representing “absorption into wisdom.” This truth, validated by these real Da Vinci code revelations, was secreted from the time King Phil - ip of France sought to own the vast Templar wealth, and he along with Pope Clement V had the Templars captured and tortured.

It is Leonardo, not Vitruvius, who points out that ‘If you open the legs so as to reduce the stature by one-four - teenth and open and raise your arms so that your middle fingers touch the line through the top of the head, know that the centre of the extremities of the outspread limbs will be the umbilicus, and the space between the legs will make an equilateral triangle’ [with its tip at the groin representing the male creative and procreative element.

[1] An erudite and forthright critic of the Greeks was William Chap - pell (1809-1888): “There is no longer room to doubt that the entire Greek system was mainly derived from Egypt, Phoenicia, Babylon, or other countries of more ancient civilization than Greece” [Chappell 1874, 1]."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Notes 201 [2] [Cornford 1952, 107ff]. Europe’s last distinguished representative of this ancient tradition was probably St Francis of Assisi, whose fits of ecstasy and sermon to the birds (c.1220) are unmistakably shamanic. So are Socrates’ ‘daemon’ (or ‘inner voice’) and his trances. [3] From Abaris, his ‘Hyperborean’ disciple, Pythagoras obtained a golden arrow that, like the witch’s broom, enabled him to fly and ap - pear the same day in two towns separated by ‘a journey of many days’. See Guthrie 1987, 90-91, 128. [4] The story of Pythagoras meditating ‘the greater part of day and night’ in a cave outside the city of Samos [Guthrie 1987, 62] recalls another familiar practice of the shamans. return to text [5] Lawlor, CF. 1991, 48. It should be kept in mind that Chatwin’s influential book, though based on personal experience of Aboriginal Australia, is a work of literary rather than strictly scientific anthropol - ogy. [6] Some years ago I applied for a major research grant to conduct a comparative and historical study of the Aboriginal Corroboree as the ‘indigenous Australian opera’. The application was referred to the two most eminent female anthropologists in the country, one of whom gave the project a top rating for its originality and national signifi - cance; the other (who happened to have been trained by the same philosophers who taught me) utterly damned the whole idea, especial - ly with the revelation that I had never attended a corroboree (except, that is, of the imported kind). [7] They also report a perfect example of ‘As above so below’: ‘Central Australian tribes believed that the Milky Way divided the sky people into two tribes and hence served as a perpetual reminder that a similar division of lands should be observed by local neighbouring tribes’ (loc. cit.). [8] Op cit., Miller, 1986, especially Foreword and Chapter 1. and Doczi 1994, Chapter 4."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"202 [9] For a concise summary of the Pythagorean doctrine and the an - cient literary evidence, see Michaelides, 1978,129-30. [10] Gadalla 2002, 22-3 claims the harmony of the spheres (that is, the ‘planetary scale’, the melodious movement of the classical ‘plan - ets’, from Earth to Saturn, and including the Sun and Moon, in the proportions of a diatonic scale) as a purely Egpytian discovery. Fabre d’Olivet had long ago reached a similar conclusion. See Godwin 1993, 347ff. [11] I once speculated that the root meaning of ‘section cut off’ re - ferred to the sectio canonis or division of the monochord but this hypothesis over-simplifies what must have been a very protracted his - tory of human invention and social development. Following Abraham Seidenberg, I now think it more likely that the ‘tem-’ words originally referred to ritual or liturgical procedures of ‘cutting off’ or delineating sections of space and time as, for example, in the timing of festivals or the reservation of sacred enclosures. Much later the ‘tem-’ vocabulary was extended to musical theory, as in the terms ‘temper’ and ‘tempera - ment’. [12] ‘In the seventh century... Sparta was the most important musical center of Greece’ (Comotti 1989, 17). [13] The classical Greek music theorists concentrated their efforts on the measurement of melody and rhythm and the development of a fairly precise notation for both. (See: Comotti 1989, 110-20.) Their greatest achievement (the significance of which has often been over - looked) was probably the quantitative analysis of the various tribal or regional ‘modes’ and the codification of their distinctive rhythms and accents. While the Greeks relied heavily on their predecessors in speculative music and tuning systems, their empirical and mathemati - cal studies of contemporary song and dance were the beginning of comparative musicology in the West. [14] John Curtis Franklin has recently thrown new light on the influ - ence of ‘Mesopotamian diatony’ on Greek music during the ‘oriental - ising period’ (c.750-650 BC). (See also: Franklin 2002a, 2002b.)

[T]he pentacle symbolizes Venus—the goddess of female sexual Love and beauty. . . . “Early religion was based on the divine order of Nature. The goddess Venus and the planet Venus were one and the same. The goddess had a place in the night-time sky and was known by many names—Venus, the Eastern Star, Ishtar, Astarte—all of them powerful female con - cepts with ties to Nature and Mother Earth. . . . [T]he planet Venus traced a perfect pentacle acros the ecliptic sky every eight years. . . . [T]he pentacle’s true origins were actually quite godly. “‘I assure you,’ Landon said, ‘despite what you see in the movies, the pentacle’s demonic interpretation is historically accurate. The original feminine meaning is correct, but the symbolism of the pentacle has been distorted over the millennia. In this case, through bloodshed.’ (pp. 36-37, The Da Vinci Code .) [17] “[T] ratios of line segments in a pentacle all equal PHI [1.618, the ‘Divine Proportion.’ PHI is the] fundamental building block in nature. Plants, animals, and even human beings all possess dimen - sional properties that adhere with . . . the ratio PHI to 1. . . . [T]he number PHI must have been preordained by the Creator of the universe. . . . Da Vinci was the first to show that the human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional rations always equal PHI. . . .

For this reason, the five-pointed star has always been the symbol for beauty and perfection associated with the goddess and the sacred feminine.”(p. 96) [18] Anagrams , such as those found by Michael MacKay adorning American coins and currency, are historically linked to mystical teach - ings of the Kabbala. Rearranged letters in Hebrew words were used to message new meanings. According to The Da Vinci Code, “French kings throughout the Renaissance were so convinced that anagrams held magic power that they appointed royal anagrammatists to help them make better decisions by analyzing words in important docu - ments. The Romans actually referred to the study of anagrams as ars magna —’the great art.’” [19] Michael K.
