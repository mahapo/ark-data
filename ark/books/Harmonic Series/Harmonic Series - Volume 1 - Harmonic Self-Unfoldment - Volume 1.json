Each and every problem submitted to the student for his study, analysis and considera- tion, is founded upon some definite and scien- tific Principle of Nature in Individual Human Life. In conformance with the method of instruction employed by the Great School, it is the business of the student himself to dis- cover the underlying Principle of Nature, to define it, analyze it, elucidate it, and finally"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"10 '^Harmonic £elf- c Un fold merit to apply it to his own life in such manner as to make it a constructive Power in the devel- opment of his own character and in the more rapid progress of his own Soul Growth. Step by step his instruction in his individ- ual work thereunder takes him over the path- way of human development and personal knowledge until he is familiar with each and every step of the way, and is able to demon- strate its scientific accuracy with absolute certainty. It not infrequently occurs, however, that his understanding of the fundamental Prin- ciple is not as complete or perfect as it should be to give him perfect mastery over every phase of the problem under consideration. As a natural result, he finds difficulty in mak- ing the personal application of the Principle to his own Life, in such manner as to meet the demands of the Law of Spiritual Unfold- ment at every point, and make himself abso- lute Master of the Process involved. Whenever and wherever such a condition arises, the student himself would understand"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"introduction 11 and appreciate what an immense help it would be to him if he could, at that point, have presented to him in a clear, simple and concise form, the scientific definition of the fundamental Principle involved, together with a clear and complete analysis of its meaning, and an elucidation of its specific application to himself as an Individual in the midst of the process of Spiritual Self-Unfold- ment. Most of all would it be a real help to him if he could have before him a definite line of suggestion from one who has been over every step of the way, and who has worked out the various methods of applying the principle of individual life, and who is able to erect clear and explicit guideposts along the road for the guidance of those who may follow him. There can be no doubt that every student who desires to travel the path of Construc- tive Spiritual Unfoldment, the path which leads to Mastership, would be glad to have at his command such an analysis and elucida- tion of each problem as would enable him to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 ^Harmonic S^lf- c ^ n foldtnent make the right application of the principle to himself and to his own Life — with the assur- ance that it comes directly from the Great School and bears the sanction of its American Representative. For this purpose, and for the definite and personal help of every individual who is earn- estly and honestly endeavoring- to travel the pathway of Constructive Spiritual Develop- ment, this Series of \"Harmonic Booklets\" is published and made accessible to all who are in need of such instruction and guidance as they contain. In each Booklet will be found all the direct and practical information possible to crowd into it, concerning one or more of the Princi- ples and Problems with which every individ- ual must become intimately acquainted in the course of his Constructive Work as an accred- ited Student. It is the purpose of the School to publish one of these Harmonic Booklets each month, as near the 15th as possible.

And here is a strange thing: It seems to be almost a Law of Life, that those who are least perfect, in their own lives, are the very ones who judge most quickly and most harshly their fellows, in the very face of the command: \"Judge not, that ye be not judged.\" In other words, it is the individual who has a \"beam\" in his own eye who is most con- cerned about the microscopical \"mote\" that is, or may be, or may not be, in the eye of a friend or neighbor. And the longer and larger the \"beam\" in one's own eye, the more clearly and certainly he seems to think he sees the invisible \"mote\" in the eye of another. Why is this ?

You betray yet another lack which is even greater, namely, lack of ability to differentiate between your duties and re- sponsibilities to \"Society\", and the duties and responsibilities you owe to yourself as an Individual Intelligence, and to your fellow human, as an evolving Soul. The \"Social Structure\" is founded on the \"Law of Life\". But \"Self -Preservation\" is said to be the \"First Law of Life\". When men and women come together in the community rela- tion, and form what we are pleased to call the \"Social Structure\", they do so upon the mu- tual agreement that each individual of them will assume and discharge certain fixed obli- gations and responsibilities to his fellows, and relinquish certain liberties of action, certain privileges and prerogatives — in order that the \"Social Structure\" may endure and be of service to all. But it so occurs that quite a considerable number of the individual members of \"Soci- ety\" fail to keep their pledges, and proceed to violate their social obligations. This imme-"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"tolerance 51 diately disturbs the social harmony, and weakens the foundation upon which the \"So- cial Structure\" rests. Hence, if the Social Structure is to endure, something must be done with those who violate their pledges, to compel them to fulfil each and every obliga- tion they assumed when they became mem- bers of \"Society\". But they must be treated justly — or as nearly so as human intelligence can determine. Hence, Society provides for the employment of its best citizens as \"Judges\", before whom every infraction of the \"Social Compact\" must be tried and de- termined, and when so determined, punished. This is done, not in the spirit of hostility, nor of bitterness, nor of criticism, nor in any manner whatsoever to humiliate or hurt the individual, but solely for the protection of Society. One who has violated the social com- pact is given every opportunity to defend himself against false charges.

He decides that the individual who has been charged with wrong is either guilty, or not guilty. If guilty he determines what is a fitting punishment. But this punishment is not administered in anger, nor with any sort of ill feeling against the accused member of Society. It is all determined absolutely for the protection of Society— to preserve the life of the Social Structure — and educate the individual members of Society to a better understanding of the duties and responsibilities they owe to the entire community we call \"Society\". Now, bear in mind that, absolutely free from malice, hatred, ill-will, or criticism against the individual who violates his pledge to Society — all this is done, solely and entirely to preserve the life of the Social Structure. It is done so that the institution we call \"Society\" may"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"tolerance 33 continue to exist. And this is because the life and existence of the institution called \"Society\" are absolutely necessary to the best interests of the individual himself, or herself.

A critical study of the development of the \"Social Compact\" — upon which all Society is founded — will show that, in the beginning of the \"experiment\", purely material interests alone were considered. Men believed that such a compact would enable them, one and all, to carry on their various occupations and lines of business in such manner and under such conditions as to give to each individual an immediate market for his products — either in direct exchange with his fellows for such of their products as he needed or could use;"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"54 '^Harmonic Self-^Uufoldment or by selling* his products for a medium of ex- change called \"'money\", that would be accept- ed by all the members of Society in exchange for their products. This arrangement would enable each individual to obtain purely mate- rial benefits in many wavs which would be equally as good for all other members of Soci- ety as for himself. This would not only create a market for all his own products, but it would bring that market directly to his own door. More than this, it would enable him to obtain from his fellows every material necessity of his own life and the life of his family and dependents, and these necessities and benefits would come to him as he needed them, and he could pay for them either by giving his own products in exchange or by giving •'money\" which he has obtained in exchange for his products. The mental, moral and spiritual benefits to be derived from this ''Social Com- pact\", were not even dreamed of in the begin- ning. They had no place whatever in the original Social Compact. They came long afterwards, and solely as an \"\"Evolution of"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"tolerance 35 Society\" and of the demand of the human Soul for higher and finer things than the mere material necessities of this physical life. Today we have carried the development of the \"Social Compact\" to a point where we all recognize the fact that the institution we call \"Society\" provides, not only for the physical and material necessities and comforts of life, but for the vastly more important things which have to do with our intellectual, moral and spiritual development and well-being. It provides an education for us and our chil- dren, and our children's children. It makes it possible for us to obtain from our schools, our libraries, our churches, their preachers, teachers and ministers, food for the Soul, and clothing for the Spirit. It opens the door of Knowledge to us in every direction, and in- vites us to enter and partake of whatsoever we find that seems good for us, or which en- ables us to render service to our fellows who need our help. But to accomplish all this, and vastly more that is yet to come, it is necessary for us to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 ^Harmonic ^elf-^Hnfolavnevil enforce the Social Compact, and see that each individual fulfils the duties, discharges the responsibilities, keeps faith with his fellows, and otherwise lives his life in conformity with the principles to which he pledged himself, as a member of Society, in the beginning. And because men and women are not yet perfect, there are always some among them who fail to keep faith with their fellows, who knowingly and intentionally violate their pledge to Society, and endeavor to get ahead by cheating and defrauding their fellow mem- bers of Society. It is to restrain these that we elect Judges whose business it is to see that all who are admitted into the Social Compact, and become members of Society, shall conform to the Laws, Rules and Regulations enacted by Soci- ety for its own protection and preservation and for the comfort and well-being of all its members, free from prejudice and injustice.

With him it is not a personal matter in any sense. He may judge a member of Society guilty of murder, and condemn him to death, upon the evidence and the law, with no feeling whatever of hate, ill- will, condemnation, or even criticism in his heart. He may even do all this while his Soul is moved to pity and sorrow for the con- demned. He may even wish, with all his heart, that his duties and obligations to Soci- ety would permit him to say to the criminal : \"Go, and sin no more\" — as did the Master, Jesus. But he is chosen to his office as \"Judge\" that he may protect Society from the disintegrating and destructive influence of evil, and preserve its very Life. Hence, he must judge, and he must punish the guilty. He has no choice. Otherwise the foundation of Society would crumble away, and the superstructure would fall in ruins to the earth.

But, you are not a \"Judge\". You have not been employed to judge your fellows.

They are no part of your Social Compact. You judge them of your own free will and accord. You judge them because you want to, and not because of any need or demand upon you. You judge them solely because it gratifies you to condemn those you assume to be your inferiors — and not for any possible good your judgment may accom- plish.

One of the most destructive Soul conditions, known to the Great Friends, is that of Intol- erance. Wherever it finds lodgment in the human Soul it paralyzes every effort of the Soul to advance to higher things. It destroys the powers of the Soul at the foundation of all Constructive Spiritual Unfoldment. It blocks the pathway that would lead the Soul onward and upward out of Spiritual Darkness into Spiritual Light.

It begins to destroy the spiritual Vitality and Constructive Energy upon which you must depend for your power to climb the pathway of Spiritual Evolution, and finally to attain to the powers of Mastership. You can never overcome the downward pull of Spiritual Gravity, so long as there is that within your own Soul which would lay a stone in the path- way of another Soul in its upward struggle from Spiritual Darkness into Spiritual Light.

This Great Law was first sensed, and later discovered, by the School of Physical Science. When its representative scientists first iden- tified their long-existing ''hypothesis\" as an established and existing \"Law of Nature\", they were at work in the field of physical phenom- ena, pure and simple. They had no definite knowledge of any other Science. To them, there was nothing which they recognized as '•scientific\", or within the realm of \"Exact Science\", or as having any \"scientific value\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Nature's Law of (Compensation 65 whatsoever, outside the field of purely physi- cal facts and exclusively physical phenomena. And yet, even in their earliest efforts to define the fundamental Principle of Nature back of the scientific concept, and formulate into definite expression the \"Law of Compensa- tion'\", they were driven to the use of terms and expressions which, of themselves, gave to the Great Law a distinctly Ethical signifi- cance, far above and beyond the limitations or the application of exclusively physical facts and physical processes. They said, for in- stance, that \"Nature demands full compensation for everything she gives\". She \"exacts full pay- ment\" under all conditions. She demands her \"Pay\", and \"what she demands she collects\". Thus, without any deliberate purpose or intent on their part — even without knowing it — they were laying the foundation for a \"Law of Compensation\" which reaches out beyond all we know, even today, as physical, or within the legitimate scope of exact physi- cal science — into the infinitely higher realms of the Intellectual, the Mental, the Moral, the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"66 ^Harmonic Q^elf-^lnfoldnieni Spiritual, and the Psychical activities and processes of Nature. But they were honest and sincere, as well as consistent, and they at no time admitted the existence of any ''science\" other than that which concerns itself with purely physical methods, activities and processes, in the realm of physical things and physical phenomena, and the facts of Nature demonstrable by physical instruments and physical means alone. It was long years afterward that our West- ern civilization took up the subject and, with the logic of exact science, proceeded to dem- onstrate the long-suspected fact that the Law of Compensation applies, in an endless scien- tific chain, throughout the physical, the spir- itual, the mental, the moral and the psychical universe of Nature.

It is altogether too general. Even admitting that it may be true, it leaves one with the feeling that the definition does not illumine the Law of Compensation very much. It leaves him with a sense of disappointment. He does not seem to have gotten anywhere. Let us now see if we can so illumine the sub- ject as to satisfy the craving of the Soul for definite and complete knowledge: 1. In its relation to physical nature, it is strictly a law of \"mechanics\". 2. It has to do with physical \"matter\". 3.

It has to do with the \"primary triad of Nature\" — which is \"Substance, Motion and Number\"* An illustration may help us: Suppose we have an automobile weighing 2000 pounds. It has a limit of 40 horse-power. It will just reach a speed of 60 miles an hour. Now, sup- pose we want to make this same car travel at 75 miles an hour, how can we do it? There are at least two ways in which this can be done. 1. We can increase our horse-power to, let us say, 70. With this added 30 horse-power we can easily drive this same car up to 75 miles per hour. But what does this mean? From a purely mechanical standpoint, it means only that, by increasing our power, we can increase our speed. But from the stand- point of the Law of Compensation, it means that if we want more speed we must be will- ing to \"pay\" for it with more power. Nature says to us: \"If you want more speed, I can give it to you, all right ; but you will have to 'compensate' me for it with power. That is,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"^Natures £.aw of Oompensatton 69 if you will give me 30 more horse-power, I will give you 15 more miles of speed per hour.

It now remains for us to formulate a definition that will express scientifically the meaning of the Great Law, as it is indicated in the fore- going illustration. But we must keep in mind the fact that we are dealing only with the Law as it applies to the physical side of Nature; for it was on the plane of physical science alone that the Law of Compensation was first discovered. Here is its definition: \"The Principle and the Process, in physical Nature, which govern the Conservation of Matter and the Conservation of Energy, whereby Nature demands and receives — as her compensation — a full equivalent for the matter she employs and the energy she ex- pends in each and every transmutation she effects.\" She demands no more, and will receive no less than a just equivalent.

But here, in this finer world of spiritual material, we find that the same laws and principles govern.

But Nature has invested man with the vol- untary power to establish his own relation to the Constructive Principle.

The point to be noted is that she made us pay. She said — in her own inimitable but unmistakable language: \"The Law of Compen- sation must be satisfied.

He knows, therefore, that his first step toward Mastership is added Spiritual Unfoldment and Soul Growth. He therefore says to Nature: \"Give me greater Spiritual Unfoldment, be- cause I must hare it if I am ever to achieve Individual Mastership.\" Nature replies : \"Very well ; but, as you know, I am not a philanthropist.

We come now to the consideration of the subject of the Great Law, from the viewpoint of its practical application to everyday life and living.

Here is where there is much difference of \"opinion\" among even the Students and Friends, as shown by the following illustration : Recently a group of friends were earnestly considering the subject of \"Compensation\","},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"^Natures £,aw of Gompensation 85 and the following question arose: Suppose A. borrows from B. $1000.

One answered as follows: The Great Law does not demand payment in kind. It is satis- fied with a perfect equivalent. Being entirely impersonal in its attitude, if A. delivers $1000 worth of potatoes to C. who needs them, this fully satisfies the Law, and the account is squared. The fact that B. is wealthy and does not need payment — either in kind, or in equivalent — removes him from consideration. The fact that C. needs the equivalent in pota- toes, entitles him to receive them from some- body. The fact that A. owes somebody $1000 — or its equivalent — entitles him to discharge his debt by giving an equivalent to C. who needs it. Do you see anything wrong with this logic?

A third suggested : Who is to determine the assumed fact that C. is in actual need? And by what method is his need to be determined, to keep within the meaning and purpose of the Law? Yet another, in support of the position of the first one, argued : We are all of us but the instruments of the Great Universal Intelli- gence — the Great Source of All. In whatever we do, we are but the instruments the Great Source uses to balance the process of Giving and Receiving, so that its Law of Compensa- tion will be satisfied.

It seems to me, my friend, that you have assumed a great deal in connection with this matter.\" The foregoing will get the problem clearly before us for consideration ; and it is one that deserves our most serious consideration, be- cause it involves the entire subject of the Law of Compensation, as well as the duties, responsibilities, obligations, rights and rela- tions of the individual thereunder. Let us take the problem apart and examine it in the light of the Great Law : 1. Is it true that the Great Universal Intelligence back of all things — the Great Source from which all things proceed — is the real Giver, and also the real Receiver — in all the transactions and transmutations of Nature ? Ans. In a great, broad, general and imper- sonal sense, there can be little doubt that such is the case. For, insofar as the limita- tions of individual human nature will permit us to reach out toward the Infinite, it is im- possible for us to conceive of a Creative Intel-"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"90 TH'Armonlc ^elf-^Uufoldment ligence which is not under, over, around, in, through and throughout all Nature. Under this broad concept of the Universe and its Creator, what we are pleased to call ''Nature\" is but the manifestation of the Creative Intel- ligence from which it has proceeded and to which our limited human intelligence assumes it will eventually return. Under this concept, we individual human entities are but so many individualized units which, when taken together, and in conjunc- tion with, all the other parts of what we call \"Nature\", make Up the One Grand, Infinite, Creative Intellixjence which we Call \"God\". And whenever or wherever there occurs an \"action\", a \"reaction\", a \"transaction\", or a \"transmutation\", it must, of necessity, take place somewhere within the limits of Nature, as well as within the limits of the Creative Intelligence, or God. In this broad view, every action is an action of God; everv reac- tion is a reaction of God, or some part of God; every transaction is a transaction of God; and every transmutation is one somewhere within"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Stature's <£aw of (Compensation 91 the \"Body of God\", or is \"of God\", as we say. Hence, every \"Gift\" must necessarily be \"from God\"; and, since God is the sum of all things that are, every \"Gift\" must, of like necessity, be a gift \"to God\". In this broad, universal concept, it is therefore true that \"God\", or the Great Source of All, is both \"Giver\" and \"Receiver\", in all the transmuta- tions and exchanges within the realms of Nature. 2. Then, is it also true that we, as Individ- ual Intelligences, are but the mechanical \"in- struments\", which God, or the Great Source of All, uses to deliver and also to receive all \"gifts\" that are everywhere being delivered and received, and re-delivered and re-received, throughout all the manifestations of Nature, or of God? Ans. Since it is true that we, as Individual Human Beings, do give gifts, and also as such human beings receive gifts from our fellows, and since we are but infinitesimal \"units\" in the Great, Infinite Body of God, it seems — from this concept of the Universe — that we"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"92 '^Harmonic Self-Enfold men t do somewhat resemble ''instruments\" em- ployed by the Great Sourse of All to carry on much of the \"Business of God\". 3. Then wherein, if at all, do we err in the assumption that, within the meaning of the Law of Compensation, every so-called \"Debt\" is an obligation incurred by God to God; and every \"Payment\" is a payment from God to God; and that mankind are but the \"instru- ments\" which God uses to carry out these myriad of individual transactions? Wherein do we err, if at all, in assuming that we, as individuals, have no business to question any \"Debt\", or any \"Payment\" — so long as we are convinced that the debt exists, and that its payment will be accepted by and acceptable to, the Great Source of All Things? Listen: Far be it from us, in the exercise of our limited intelligence, to question the correctness of your concept of \"Nature\", the Great Source of .///, the Great Infinite Omnip- otent, Omnipresent, Omniscient, Creative In- telligence, the Being we call \"God\", the infi- nitely lesser beings we call \"Man\", or the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Stature's J£aw of (Sompensation 93 relations these sustain to each other. In truth, we admit, without the least hurt to our vanity or pride, that we actually know very little, if anything, about God, the Creative Intelligence, the Great Source of All, or the relation these, or any of them, may sustain to what we call \"Nature\", or to that part of Nature we call \"Mankind\". But there is not the least doubt of the fact that you have ignored some of the conditions and facts a long way this side of God, or the Infinite limits of His limitless Infinite, which may throw a flood of light upon the operation of the great Law of Compensation. Please do not regard this as a criticism. It is not so intended. We all make mistakes, sometimes. Coming back from your splendid concept of the Infinite, to our little knowledge of a com- paratively small segment of Nature, here are some of the things which it would seem you have ignored : 1. One of the substantial facts of Nature, concerning which we all are in position to know something, is that we, as individuals,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 ^Harmonic Self-CLlnfoldment came into this life of earth, endowed and in- vested with certain faculties, capacities and powers. 2.

(c) Desire, or Choice, by which we are able to determine what things we want, and what we do not care for. (d) Self-Control, the power which enables us to strive for the things we want, and avoid the things we dislike. (e) The Power Of Reason, by which we draw conclusions from the Facts of Nature, and determine the wisdom or fallacy of our own course of action. (f) Discrimination, by the exercise of which we determine what things are Right and which are Wrong — when viewed from our in- dividual position. (g) Personal Responsibility, by which we know that we are obligated to do the things"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":".Nature's Jtaw of Compensation 95 we believe to be Right, and avoid the things we believe to be Wrong. It does not seem possible that in this mod- ern, progressive, rational and scientific age, there is even one intelligent individual who has any real doubt concerning the fact of his own Moral Accountability and Personal Re- sponsibility. Nor does it seem possible that anyone should be in doubt as to the degree of his Moral Accountability and Personal Re- sponsibility.

In fact, it is just because of this knowledge that, wherever Society exists, there is a uni- versal understanding and assumption that, in our normal state and condition, we do exercise these faculties, capacities and powers of the Soul independently, and that, by reason there- of, we are Morally Accountable and Person- ally Responsible beings. This mutual understanding and assump- tion enter into, and are a vital part of, the \"Social Compact\", upon which all Human Society is founded and exists.

Eliminate this Vital Element, and every \"Social Prop\" is instantly destroyed. But wherein and how does all this have any bearing upon the great Law of Compensa- tion? Here is the answer: According to the teachings and findings of the Great School, the Law of Compensation applies to, and runs through, not only the human institution called 'Society\", but throughout the entire Moral Universe.

He must pay his debt in kind — wherever this is humanly possible, and the obligation has not been modified by mutual consent of the parties in interest. 4. Wherever it is not humanly possible for him to pay in kind, his obligation binds him to pay an exact equivalent — which his cred- itor is morally bound to accept. 5.

This satisfies the Law, as between him and his own indi- vidual creditor. But it transfers to the new debtor the Moral Obligation to compensate the original creditor, if this be possible. If it is not possible, then the new creditor has the same moral right to discharge his debt by rendering an equivalent service to someone who is in need and entitled to receive the help. This again transfers the debt to the last debtor. The problem now becomes an \"endless chain\" — until the original creditor lias been paid, and the Law of Compensation has been finally and fully satisfied.

The Great Law tells us that we have no right, either legal or moral, to delegate to ourselves the authority to judge our fellows. We have no right to say: 'This one does not need\", or \"This one is the more deserving\". In other words, \"Judge not\". Your business is to pay your debt ; and you cannot pay your debt by ignoring it.

The same thing is equally true with the animal. Each individual animal comes into"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Sri [-Control 115 this physical life, bringing with it a full as- sortment of appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires. It is true that these may not be quite so complex nor so definitely and finely differentiated in the animal as they are in man ; nevertheless, thev constitute the secret springs which impel the individual ani- mal to action, just as truly and just as cer- tainly as thev do the individual human. The animal experiences an appetite for food. This appetite immediately impels it to action. Instantly it goes in search of the food that will satisfy its appetite. It meets others of its kind, and they are doing the same thing. Each individual animal is seek- ing for its own individual gratification. It is not thinking of, nor concerned about, helping its fellows. There is just one exception to this absolute attitude of Selfishness among ani- mals, and that is where the maternal instinct impels a mother animal to care for her own young while they are yet helplessly depend- ent upon her for life and protection. Except for this purely maternal impulse, \"Self-Pres-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"114 Qi&rmonic ^pAf-^llufoldtnent ervation\" seems to be the \"First Law of Life\", in the animal kingdom. To such a degree is this Law exemplified among them that each individual animal is ready and willing to sac- rifice the lives of its fellows, wherever this may seem to be necessary to enable it to sat- isfy its own appetite for food. It is true, however, that, in some instances, one animal will join its fellows in the hunt for, and the capture of, food. As an illustra- tion of this fact, the wolf will join its fellows in trie general hunt for larger, more powerful and more dangerous animals — such, for in- stance, as the elk and the moose. When they succeed in overtaking it, the individual wolves of the hunting pack will unite their intelli- gence, skill and numbers, to overpower and bring down their prey. But, the moment their enemy falls a victim to their united attack, the Law of Self-Preservation again be- comes supreme among them. The instant their appetite for food becomes dominant again, they will fight and kill each other, if necessary to the gratification of their appe-"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Self-Control 115 tites. From that moment there is no unself- ish, generous, fraternal or altruistic spirit among them. Each individual animal is in- tent upon just one thing, namely, obtaining the satisfaction of his own appetite. Once this is accomplished, he lies down to rest and sleep and enjoy his satisfaction — or it may be that the secret spring of action shifts from \"appetite\" to \"passion\". In that event, he pro- ceeds at once to seek for the gratification of his animal passion. Here again his life be- comes a battle for individual supremacy. The males fight, even to the death, for the favors of the females. The Law of Might prevails, and only the survivor wins. So it is in every department of animal life. It is a struggle for the gratification of the individual appetites, passion, emotions, im- pulses and desires, regardless of the welfare or happiness of others. Whilst it is true that the animals with which we are best acquaint- ed — those we call \"domestic\", such as the dog, the cat, the horse, etc. — have the indi- vidual Power of Will — through the exercise"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"116 ^Harmonic Q^elj-'lJLnjoldnient of which they might, if they so desired, re- strain, control, or even temporarily suppress their appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires; nevertheless, the most critical observation discloses the fact that they do not exercise their individual Power of Will in that unselfish line. On the other hand, their exercise of the Power of Will is always in direct line with the desire for individual Self- Gratification. Even the mother-love of the animal dies when its young are weaned. The mother instantly casts them out of her life forever. From that moment she refuses to feed them or care for them in other ways, -lence, they immediately accept the fact that, with them, — \"Self-Preservation is the first Laic of Life\". The mother does the same. She fol- lows her own natural desire for reproduction, proceeds to raise a new family of infants, and forget the old. Indeed, in every department of animal life, we find that the exercise of the Power of Will is always in direct line with self -gratification of the appetites, passions, emotions, impulses"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"X elf-Qontrol W and desires, and never contrary to, or in re- straint of, them. In other words, within the realm of animal life the altruistic spirit has not been born. It does not exist. The human, however, possesses the same appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires which impel the animal to action for their seltish gratification. He also possesses the individual Power of Will by which to seek their gratification. If these were his sole possessions, one might logically and naturally conclude that he, too, would be impelled to action, as is the animal, solely by the selfish desire to gratify his appetites, passions, emo- tions, impulses and desires. The Masters of Natural Science, however, find that the human possesses something more than does the animal — something that is fundamental and vital — something that lifts the human to a place of Life and Action virtually unknown to the animal kingdom. The Fourth, the highest, ''Life Element\" in Nature, (the Soul Element) invests and en- dows the individual human with faculties,"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"118 THarmonic Self-CU.ufoldment capacities, powers, aspirations, knowledge, understanding and experiences which are vir- tually unknown to the animal, as well as to all the rounds of individual life below the human. Whilst it seems to be an open question — in the minds of many who have made a pro- found study of the subject, whether the ani- mal possesses the power to reason from cause to effect — there can be no possible doubt that the human does possess that power. And it is herein that the human appears to have a great and important advantage over the ani- mal. Especially is this true with reference to the higher aspects of individual life and its possibilities. The highest Life Element in man — the Soul Element — immediately gives to him a Moral Nature, vastly unlike the ««-moral nature of the animal. This, together with his added Power of Reason — and the development of his Rational Powers to a point where he is able to recognize and appreciate the Great Law of Compensation in Nature — lifts him to a plane of understanding which enables him"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 119 to differentiate, with a fair degree of accu- racy, between the Constructive and the De- structive Processes of Nature. It also gives to him an exact and definite knowledge of the Moral Order of the Universe, involving a knowledge and power to differentiate between that which is Morally Right and that which is Morally Wrong. It is here, in the realm of his Moral Nature, that the human rises to a level of individual unfoldment and growth entirely above and beyond the limitations of the animal. How- ever widely scientists may disagree concern- ing the ability of the animal to reason from cause to effect, they nevertheless recognize the fact that, from the standpoint of our human understanding, the animal is virtually devoid of all knowledge, understanding, ap- preciation or sense of Morality, or of Moral Principles and Values. When the animal is hungry, he seeks food wherever he can find it, and he takes it with no thought as to his per- fect right to do so. The question as to its ownership is something that is entirely be-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"120 EHarmonic Self-^lLnfoldment yond the limits of his intelligent understand- ing. He is hungry. He finds food. He eats it — solely because it satisfies his hunger. He is not in the least concerned as to his Moral Right to take it. It does not occur to his nascent intelligence that another may want it, or have a right to it. He does not hesitate for so much as an instant. He simply eats In all this he is governed absolutelv bv his 'appetite\" — by his sense of hunger and the de- sire to satisfy it. He meets one of his kind. They do not like each other. Anger flares up in the conscious- ness of each. Instantly they fight — and they continue to fight until one or the other is either killed or conquered. They did not stop to moralize upon their right to fight, nor upon their perfect right to kill each other. They v ere simply impelled and moved by the pas- sion of Anger and Hatred. Each had the Power of Will by which he might have con- trolled his Anger. But neither of them had the least desire to exercise his power of Will in that direction. All his Power of Will was"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 121 exercised in the effort to destroy his enemy, and thereby gratify his Angry Passion. A critical and exhaustive study of the sub- ject will disclose the interesting and vital fact that the animal, at all times, is moved to action by the dominating influence of his appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires, with no regard for consequences — except in just so far as they may contribute to his self-gratification or defense. If he temporarily controls his appetite for food — while in the immediate presence of a threat- ening enemy — this is because he is impelled by the more powerful impulse of \"Fear\", and not in the least because of any altruistic sug- gestion or impulse. In other words, at no time does he exercise his power of Will in restraint of his appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires, but in discovering ways and means whereby he may gratify them — without danger to himself. But, in the course of the evolution of Indi- vidual Intelligence, from the hour that the \"Soul Element\" of Nature is added to the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"122 harmonic o)e.lf- c Uinfold>nent \"Spiritual Life Element\" of the animal king- dom, and man becomes a \"Living Soul\", his Power of Will becomes a Moral equipment — whose exercise thenceforward is governed by considerations that transcend the entire plane of \"Animal Intelligence\". Hence, with the birth of man — as a \"Living Soul\" — came ' 'Mor- ality\" into the world — a Knotvledge of Right and Wrong, a Recognition of Personal Respons- ibility and Moral Accountability, a realization of the beneficent truth that his own best good demands of him that he thenceforth exercise his own Power of Will to restrain his appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires \"within due bounds\", an inspiration to obey the Law of Spiritual Unfoldment and abide by the Great \"Law of Compensation\". There can be no doubt of the fact that this is \"a Big Order\", all right; but, at the same time, it is one which every normal individual accepts as a part of his \"Inheritance from Nature\". He now knows, without the slight- est question, that he dares not live the unre- strained life of the animal ; he knows that he"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 125 dares not exercise his Power of Will for the mere gratification of his physical appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires, re- gardless of the results and consequences to his fellow humans ; he knows that, whenever and wherever the best good of humanity de- mands, he must exercise his divine Power of Will to restrain his own personal appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires within the constructive limits of \"Temper- ance\" ; he knows that his own best good, as well as that of his fellows, demands of him that he exercise his own Power of Self -Control, at all times, thereby holding in restraint every impulse of his animal nature, thus mak- ing himself absolute Master of them, instead of becoming the acquiescent instrument of them.

As a result of tens-of -thousands of years of personal experience and demonstration, the School of Natural Science is able to point out to its students each and every step of the Way which leads to \"Individual Mastership\" and to the normal unfoldment of each and all of the five spiritual senses — until its Students are able to see, hear, feel, and otherwise sense the Spiritual World of Life as definitely and as absolutely as they do the physical. If there be those who question the truth of this statement, it is only because of the fact that it is natural for us \"humans\" to believe un- questionably only in the things wiiich fall within the limits of our own personal experi- ences, and to question the truth of whatso- ever happens to fall outside those limitations. Even though a critical analysis of the subject should disclose the fact that the basis of this natural skepticism on our part is \"Intellectual Vanity\", we should not permit ourselves to be"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 125 intolerant of each other — because this seems to be an affliction from which we all suffer, to some extent. This gives to us a splendid opportunity and inspiration for the exercise of mutual sympathy instead of condemnation. For a moment, therefore, let us lift ourselves — even by our own bootstraps, if necessary — above the plane of our purely animal nature, and just — in fact — ''vibrate\". Maybe we can thus shake ourselves loose from some of our unrestrained appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires of the flesh. Who knows ? Returning now to the subject of \"Morality\" as a distinct human concept — as something entirely above and beyond the plane of exclu- sively animal life, development and nature — we find that, primarily, both the animal and the human are moved to action by the impell- ing power of their inherent appetites, pas- sions, emotions, impulses and desires. How- ever, from this point forward, a new and mar- velous Element enters into the development of the human — the \"Soul Element\" — and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"126 harmonic Q^elf-^llnfoldment \"Man becomes a Living Soul\". While he still possesses all the appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires of the animal, and of his own animal nature ; nevertheless, his Soul attributes and qualities now exercise a powerful and subtle influence which definitely modify his lines of Life and Action. No longer is it possible for him, blindly and unreservedly, to bend every power and energy of his being to the selfish gratifi- cation of his own individual appetites, pas- sions, emotions, impulses and desires, with no thought of or consideration for the well-being and happiness of his fellows. No longer is it possible for him, ruthlessly and without com- punction, to kill his fellows merely because they interfere with him in the free and unre- strained gratification of his purely animal nature. On the other hand, under the nat- ural growth and development of his moral nature, he comes to realize the profound fact that his fellows have as much right as himself to gratify their desires of the flesh. For the first time he knows that he must not trespass'"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 127 upon those rights, but must respect them — if he would have his own rights respected, or be free from the encroachments of trespassers. This means that he must no longer yield to the impulse of Anger when his fellows seek to share with him the opportunities for self- gratification of his animal nature. This first recognition of the necessity for self-restraint, the gratification of his animal nature, is the beginning of Self-Mastery. It is the point from which he begins the exercise of his i Power of Will in restraint of his appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires of the flesh. It would be profoundly interesting to follow the evolutionary steps by which the human individual has come to his present under- standing of \"Morality\" and the necessity for Self -Control in the achievement of \"Master- ship\". But the vital and most essential point to be observed in all this is the fact that he has finally come to know — as one of the facts of Nature — that Morality is the absolute foundation of all Constructive Spiritual Unfold-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"128 '^Harmonic £elf-' : Uufoldment ment; that there is a Destructive method and process in Nature, as well as a Constructive; that it is within his individual power to align himself with whichever method and process he chooses ; that in choosing the Constructive he is aligning himself with that which all men know to be the Principle of Righteousness in Nature — that which we recognize as right; that in choosing the Destructive he is align- ing himself, just as definitely with that which we all know to be wrong in Nature. He has now come to know that, in defying the funda- mental Law of Righteousness and overriding the Rights of his fellows, he is doing that which violates the very law of his own being; and that, under the Law of Compensation, he must pay the price which Nature exacts from him for each and every such violation.

As so often suggested, and sometimes defi- nitely taught, by instructors in some of the numerous and well-known occult and mystical orders, does this mean that the individual who enters upon the Pathway of this pro- found Achievement, must absolutely extin- guish, destroy and eradicate from his Soul every appetite, passion, emotion, impulse and desire of his Being? Does it mean that he must absolutely eliminate all these things from his Life — and become a being devoid of all conscious feeling ? By no means ! It does not mean that he must either extinguish or eliminate from his individual Consciousness a single appetite, passion, emotion, impulse or desire. It means only that, by the voluntary, conscious and intentional exercise of his own individual Power of Will, he must establish and maintain absolute Control of his emotional nature. He must obtain and hold such per- fect mastery over his appetites, passions,"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 131 emotions, impulses and desires, that not one of them shall influence him to indulge him- self, along any line of action, to a point which becomes destructive. In other words, it means only that he must establish and maintain that degree and quality of Self -Control which makes him absolute Master of Himself at all times, and impels him to hold every appetite, pas- sion, emotion, impulse and desire, strictly within the bounds of Temperance. This means that he must exemplify, in his daily life, a constructive exercise of each and every impulse and desire of his nature. Just at this point is where much fallacy finds its way into the various systems of metaphysical instruction out here in our Western World. Indeed, it seems most diffi- cult for our Occidental Psychologists to grasp and assimilate the vital and fundamental Fact that Nature docs not demand the impossible of any individual. They do not seem to be able to grasp or assimilate the simple and logical fact of Nature, that every function of the human organism — whether physical or spirit-"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"152 '^Harmonic ^elf-IJiufoldment ual — is intended for Use, and that its proper and temperate Use is always wholesome and con- structive, to both the individual and society. Often we find even our best known public teachers of psychology giving utterance to syllogisms such as this : \"Anger is destructive to spiritual growth; hence anger must be entirely eliminated from the human Soul and utterly destroyed, root and branch.\" Or: \"Physical Passion is destructive to psychic unfoldment; hence, physical passion must be gotten rid of. It must be utterly eradicated from our natures and forever destroyed.\" Or : \"Fear paralyzes the Soul; hence, fear must be eliminated from our natures, uprooted and destroyed.\" etc., etc. The trouble with such seemingly profound utterances is in the fact that each of these several syllogisms contains some subtle fal- lacy which would naturally mislead the mind of an r student who is not familiar with the subject matter. For instance: 1. It is not true that — \"Anger is destructive"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 153 to spiritual growth\"— under all conditions and circumstances. The indulgence of anger — to a point beyond the individual Poxver of Self -Control -is, indeed and in truth, ''destructive to spir- itual growth\", and should never be permitted. But, if the impulse of anger is immedi- ately controlled, it may then be transmuted into an impulse that will inspire the individ- ual to constructive action resulting in the highest possible good — not only to tne indi- vidual himself, but to others within the range of his individual influence. Hence, here is an instance in which the major premise of the syllogism is not true — under all conditions and circumstances. And, it is a recognized prin- ciple of Logic that — \"If a premise be false, no conclusion based upon it can be relied upon\". It is just here where so many are led off from the Highway of Truth, into the by-ways of Sciolism. The error, in this case, lies in the fact that anger is not — in its essential nature — destruc- tive necessarily. It becomes destructive only when it is indulged. In other words, it is the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"134 3-Carmonic Q)elf- c ULnfol6vvi9.nt Self-indulgence of it that becomes destruc- tive — and not the mere fact of its existence. The key, in this case, is in every man's possession. It is in the exercise of his Power of Will, and the establishment of Self -Control over the impulse and desire to indulge his anger freely and without restraint. 2. The error, in this case, lies in the state- ment that — \"anger must be eliminated from the Soul and utterly extinguished.\" When it is known that anger controlled may become a powerful impulse for the accom- plishment of good by the individual in whose Soul it exists, it can be seen how easilv we may be misled by faulty logic. 3. Again, it is quite true that — \"The indul- gence of physical passion\" — may become de- structive to psychic unfoldment; but it does not necessarily follow that — \"physical pas- sion must be entirely eliminated from our es- sential natures.\" Etc. In truth, physical passion was implanted in the human Soul for a very definite purpose — and that purpose was not destructive. . When"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 135 controlled by the individual Power of Will, and its indulgence held absolutely \"within due bounds\", it is no more destructive than the love of Music — and is just as beautiful. In the accomplishment of Nature's purpose, physical passion is not sl destructive thing\" in human nature. It is only when the individual violates Nature's purpose and intent, and indulges his passionate desire to a point be- yond the limits of its constructive aspects, that it becomes destructive. When wisely controlled, within constructive limits, the im- pulse may be transmuted into activities that will result in the highest possible good — to both the individual himself and his fellows. Here again, the Key is Self-Control. 4. It is also true that — \"Fear paralyzes the Soul\" — zchen permitted to run its course un- checked.. But it is equally true that fear — when under the restraining power of Self- Control — may become the background of im- pulses which lead the individual to action in lines that accomplish the greatest possible good."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"13b ^Harmonic §>elf- c U,ufoldment For illustration : You learn that a mad-dog- is running at large in the community, and that several children within your reach are in great danger. You are filled with Fear — at the mere thought of a mad-dog at large. But your desire to save those children from the possibility of a horrible death, impels you to rush out in the face of the same danger to yourself, find the children, gather them in, and keep them until the danger passes. Thus, you have transmuted your own emotion of fear into an impulse of action for the unself- ish protection of your fellows. In this prompt transmutation of your own sense of fear into an impulse of beneficent protective action, you have accomplished the greatest possible good to others — and have thereby earned for yourself Nature's inevitable reward for your own unselfish effort. Suppose you had been entirely free from all sense of fear, in this case ; you would have said to yourself: 'There's no danger\"— and would have left the children imminently ex- posed to a horrible danger, and possible"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 137 death. Would you say, under such circum- stances, that \"Fear should be entirely elim- inated from our natures\"? Or, would you not be inclined to say: \"Here is a case where Fear undoubtedly serves a vital and construc- tive end\"? Surely, you would not want ii \"eliminated\" nor \"extinguished\" from your own Soul — under those conditions. Hence, here once more we find that the thing to be condemned is not the impulse of Fear in the human Soul, but the indulgence of it to a point where it either paralyzes his powers of action, or becomes a destructive agency and impels the individual to action in lines that result in harm. From this general analysis, it must be clear to the reader who has followed closely to this point, that the difficulty in the development of Constructive Spirituality and Mastership is not due to the fact that we possess appe- tites, passions, emotions, impulses and de- sires, but to the rather humiliating fact that, instead of mastering them, we permit them to master us. Instead of controlling them,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"138 ^Harmonic Self-^LLufoldinunt we permit them to control us. Instead of keeping them \"within due bounds\", we in- dulge them beyond the limits of their con- structive and proper activities, and permit them to lead us into destructive conditions, of both mind and body. If we but did our part, under the Law of Compensation, we could have no quarrel with either God, or Nature, or the Great Creative Intelligence ; for, in that event, we would ex- ercise our divine Power of Will to establish the degree and quality of Self-Control which would transmut every impulse of the Soul — whether of anger, fear, lust, life or love, into some beneficent activity that would bring to us and to our fellows nothing but constructive and beneficent results.

And this is well within the powers and the possibilities of every normally developed indi- vidual who sets himself the task of attaining the highest degree of constructive spiritual unfoldment within the range of his individual powers. Nor will he find the task fraught with such tremendous difficulty — once he has entered upon the Path in the right spirit, and with an unwavering purpose to succeed ; for, one by one, what appeared to be insurmount- able difficulties melt away and disappear. Day by day the road becomes less rough and precipitous and the going less difficult — until the ''Living of a Life\" becomes the natural and inevitable thing, and we grow spiritually as grow the physical flowers in the vernal spring-tide.

This is but natural, because he is not in position to compare his own with those of any other individual.

It has"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Self-Gontrol 145 been said that — \"No chain is stronger than its weakest link.\" If this be true, then the man who succumbs to the little, insignificant, pin-pricking, flea-biting emotions and im- pulses of irritability, is a far \"weaker sister\" than the man who yields only to the most powerful passions, emotions and impulses of destructive human nature. I hope my read- ers and students will stop at this point, and think out the principle involved in the Self- Control that sustains Individual Mastership. I fancy you would find it difficult, if not im- possible, even to imagine a \"Master\" of the Great School who would fall a victim of an irritable temper because his wife forgot to salt the potatoes, or left a button off his trousers, or because he barked his shin on a chair when he came home late and found the lights out. No, it is not possible. The \"Mas- tership\" that opens to the Soul of Man the doors of the Spiritual World, and gives to him the keys thereto, means the quality of Self- Mastery that lifts the individual above all the subjective influences of pettiness involved in"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 ^Harmonic Q)elf- c LLnfoldment irritability of temper. And remember that the indulgence of any impulse, to a destructive point, involves ''Subjection\" to his impulsive nature. If any student or friend, or other individ- ual, who is afflicted (or thinks he is) with an irritable temper, will conscientiously adopt the following line of procedure, it will be but a very short time until he will find himself absolute Master of every petty emotion and impulse of his nature, with a Soul as placid and unruffled as a deep pool of limpid water beyond the disturbing influence of the winds. 1. Treat these little, irritable impulses as if each one were a mischievous and malicious little personality whose deliberate purpose and intent are to annoy him, worry him, irri- tate him, and see just how far it can make him lose his equilibrium — so that it may laugh at him and enjoy his discomfiture and humiliation. In many such instances the facts would warrant precisely this method of procedure, without the introduction of any psychological fictions."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Self- Control 147 2. The very first time he feels the impulse of impatience or irritability rising in his con- sciousness, let him just stop everything else — for only an instant — and try to visualize in his mind the little \"Imp\" that is trying to annoy him. Picture the grin of devilish sat- isfaction and anticipation on its impish little face. Now let the responsive smile light up his own face, as he mentally says to it: \"No you don't, you little sprite, not this time. Your 'nettle' has no 'sting' any more. Now, run along, sonny.

Like the student above mentioned, it may be a little hard on his respiration, for a few days; but the sense of Mastery will steadily grow within him, until it will, in due time, become an established fact — and the mastery of his difficulty is complete. There is not an evil or destructive appetite, passion, emotion, impulse or desire of the human Soul but can be mastered — if the indi- vidual will meet it with the power of his own will in its inception, before he has indulged it to a point where he has actually surrendered himself to its domination.

You will find that some of them, if not all of them, can be adapted by you to fit perfectly your own needs. 3. During the 30 days immediately follow- ing your receipt of this booklet, after you lie down at night, compose yourself, as sug- gested in Booklet No. 1. Then review the day, to see if you can determine whether you have exemplified perfect Self-Control of all your appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires, during the day. If not, then make a careful study of your failures, and note wherein you might have done better. Determine just wherein you failed, and make it your earnest effort to correct your methods so as to guard against any future failures of the same character. Then go to sleep serenely, with the comfort and consolation that you at least tried. In the morning before rising for the day, make a firm resolve to make this day an exemplification of absolute Self-Control.

Let us together examine it, that we may subject it to the severe test of exact science : 1. It has reference to an internal State of Being, and not to the specific activities of the individual through which that particular State of Being is accomplished. 2. It indicates, however, that there is a definite Process by and through which that specific State of Being is, or may be, devel- oped. 3. It gives us to understand that the Proc- ess is a Voluntary one — which means that it is set in motion in direct response to the Will of the individual himself. 4. It makes clear and definite the fact that the specific method and process by which that internal State of Being is, or may be, accom- plished, is through the individual exercise of the power of Self-Control. This does not mean that it is, in essence, what we designate as \"Self-Control\" ; but the direct result of the Power of Self-Control in operation."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"tjpoise 157 5. It impresses upon us the fact that the Self-Control, by and through which that internal State of Being is, or may be, estab- lished, must result from the voluntary exer- cise of the Power of Will on the part of the individual himself. In other words, it cannot be induced or established through the exer- cise of Will Power by any other individual. And herein arises one of the vital and funda- mental Principles of Psychology back of all constructive Spiritual Unfoldment and Soul Growth. 6. Hence, it depends absolutely upon the ability of the individual himself to establish the necessary Self -Control, and then maintain it by the Power of his own Will until it be- comes an accomplished development of the Soul — which means a permanent and natural Soul Growth — like the development and growth of a flower. 7.

They are still there — all of them — just as God, or Nature, originally planted them within the Soul of the individual. They are just as ro- bust and as powerful as ever they were. They are just as active and as insistent as they have ever been. They are just as eagerly seeking* for self -gratification and self-expres- sion. But we find that these do not dominate the activities of the individual now, as they did in other years — nor as the same physical appe- tites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires automatically controlled the activities of the animal. Why is this ? What has occurred to the individual human to make him different from the animal ? Why does he not automat- ically respond to the appetites and passions of the flesh, as does the animal, and as he, himself, did — more perfectly — during the _jQ*ly infancy of the human race?"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"tpoise 159 These questions, deeply pertinent and vital as they are, cannot fail to receive correct answers in the mind of every normal man or woman who has arrived at the \"age of discre- tion\". The answers are: Because his purely physical — animal — nature no longer controls his activities as an individual intelligence. His purely animal appetites, passions, emo- tions, impulses and desires do not now impel him to automatic action in search of mere self-gratification alone. In other words, they are now under the dominion and restraint of his own independent Will Power. In fact, he is now something more than a mere animal. He is a \"Living Soul\". As such, the Soul attri- butes, which have been in process of evolve- ment, unfoldment and growth since the birth of humanity (and which came into existence when the Fourth Life Element— the Soul Ele- ment — was added to the other three) have reached a point of development and power where they are now the dominant and su- preme factors in individual human life.

By extending and enlarging the field of his researches for knowledge — especially knowl- edge of individual Life and its purposes and possibilities — he comes to know, after much time and personal effort, that he has a spirit- ual organism, as well as a physical.

This means that he must begin at the very foundation. He must first bring every animal appetite, pas- sion, emotion, impulse and desire under the direct control of his own Will Power. He must be able, by the intelligent exercise of his Will Power, to bring every animal impulse and tendency of his own nature under the restraining power and dominion of his power of Self-Control.

A clearer understanding of the vital nature of this problem of \"illiteracy\" — more espe- cially with reference to the correct use of words — may be suggested by the following statement from one of the Great Masters of Natural Science — made to me more than forty years ago, during the course of my own personal instruction : \"If all men were agreed as to the exact meaning of the words they use, the disputes, disagreements and controversies of life would virtually cease. This is because the disagree- ments and controversies of this life do not have anything to do with the Facts of Na- ture, but arise out of the words men use in their efforts to define and explain the Facts of Nature to each other. Let them first come to a definite agreement as to the meanings of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"196 '^Harmonic Self-'Unfoldment the words they employ; and, with rare ex- ceptions, no cause of disagreement remains.\" In alignment with the same view of the problem, one of our more modern writers says: ''Insofar as men of science, or letters, differ from each other as to the meanings they give to the same words — they speak and write a different and an unknown language.\" Those of us who, for half-a-century, have been laboring with the same problem, are in position to understand and appreciate the meaning and vital significance of these care- fully considered utterances. We know that the basis of exact science is exact expression ; and the basis of exact expression is accurate definition of terms. Hence, our very first step in the exposition of our theme is to know exactly what the Great School means bv the term \"Cheerful- ness\". 1. Webster's New International Dictionary defines Cheerfulness as a \"Quality, or State of Being\". 2. Its agreed synonyms are given as \"good"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Gheerfulness 197 cheer, gladness, joy, merriment, jollity, gay- ety, exhilaration\", etc. 3. Further, it is stated: \"Cheerfulness (as opposed to gloom) implies a bright and equ- able temper, or disposition, which shows itself in the face, the voice, the actions ; it suggests a strong and spontaneous, but quiet, flow of good spirits.\" \"Mirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks through a gloom of clouds and glitters for a moment — and then dies. Cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind, and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity.\" From these suggestions, it should not be over-difficult to evolve a definition of the word that will meet the exacting requirements of Natural Science. 1. Like the word \"Poise\", it has reference to an internal Attitude of Soul, or a State of Being. 2. It discloses itself to others in the ex- pression of the face, in the tones and inflec- tions of the voice, in the actions and the en- tire manner of the cheerful individual."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"198 c Harmonic ^elf- c Uinjoldment 3. Among other things, it expresses \"serenity\" and \"tranquility\" — but something more. The individual who has attained the internal attitude of Soul and state of being denned as \"Cheerfulness\", is more than mere- ly \"serene\". He is more than merely \"tran- quil\". He is something more than both of these together. There is that within him which expresses a deep and abiding satisfac- tion — with Life, and with all that it stands for. No individual who has enjoyed this deep and abiding sense of satisfaction can fail to realize a profound sense of gratitude to the Giver of all Good. The Soul seems to ac- knowledge, within itself, the beneficence, the graciousness, the eternal righteousness and justice of all Nature. And, in appreciation of its own share in the benign gratuities of the Universe, it sends forth a radiant energy of pure gladness that fills its entire environment with the healing Balm of Faith.

The question naturally arises as to the con- sistency of Cheerfulness with Poise, as inter- nal States of Being. That is to say, can an indi- vidual be both poised and cheerful at the same time? Isn't there a certain quality of stoicism in the internal state of poise which makes the outward manifestation of cheer- fulness impossible ? A correct answer to these questions makes it necessary for us to go back, for a brief examination, to the subject of \"Poise\" — as this is carefully considered in Booklet No. 4 of this series.

In spite of my earnest effort to clear up the subject, in that booklet, I know full well that there are many who still cling to the Oriental con- cept of \"Poise\", which limits it to the out- ward expression of \"serenity\" and \"tranquil- ity\" — both of which might be consistent with a certain degree of \"stoicism\" which the term \"Poise\" suggests to their minds. One of the specific purposes of Booklet No. 4 was to make clear and definite to the student and reader the fact that Poise — the internal State of Being so carefully defined by the School of Natural Science, in that Booklet — leaves no room whatsoever for either the insensibility, the inertia, or the coldness of what is gener- ally understood by \"Stoicism\".

And it is even more widely divergent from the character of ''Poise\" that enables an indi- vidual — in the midst of the most excruciating pain, or suffering — to convey to those about him the outward expression of Soul Peace and Cheerfulness. The question naturally arises, as to whether there is any merit in so exercising the Power of Will as to give no outward expression of pain when, as a matter of fact, the individual is suffering the most excruciating physical torture.

These are phases of the subject that are justly entitled to the most careful and critical examination, study, and analysis. But before we enter further upon the fundamental prin- ciples involved in the subject, there is another aspect of the problem that is well worth our present consideration. It is this: The Student of Natural Science who is en- gaged upon the problem of his own individ- ual unfoldment, with the purpose of exempli- fying, in his daily life and conduct, the Pow- ers of a Master of the Law, may — and often does — develop such a degree and quality of Self-Mastery that, by the exercise of his Power of Will alone over his nerve body, he may be able, for the time being, to reverse the sensory currents and thus prevent any"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"(Cheerfulness 203 sensation from traveling from the outward point of touch to the inner consciousness of sensation. Or, instead of thus \"reversing\" the sensory current, he may — by the exercise of that same marvelous Power of Will alone — pro- duce temporary so-called \"nerve paralysis\", in any part of the physical body. The writer speaks from personal experience in the foregoing statements. Merely for pur- poses of demonstration, he has permitted stu- dents to pass a needle through his hand or arm — with no more sensation than there would have been if the point of contact had been completely anaesthetized by the applica- tion of cocaine. This freedom from sensa- tion, under such conditions, is accomplished solely by his developed Power of Will over his sensory organism. These experiments have raised the ques- tion, in the minds of some of his students, as to whether the process employed is not so- called \"auto-hypnotism\", meaning \"self-hyp- notism\". A very simple answer to this sug-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"204 S-Carmonic c5«//-^/w/o/c/me«^ gestion is contained in the fact that there is no such thing, from the standpoint of science, as auto-hypnotism, or self-hypnotism.

The subject is of such value and im- portance, as well as interest, that it might be well for the student to review it in this connection. Let us now return to the consideration of the question: \"Is there any merit in so exercising the Power of Will as to give no outward expres- sion of pain when, as a matter of fact, the individual is, at the time, suffering the most excruciating physical torture ?\" There are two distinct aspects of the sub- ject, and each is of vital importance in its relation to the correct answer to the question : (a) The very exercise of his Will-Power in restraint of all outward manifestation of pain, or suffering, has the direct and definite result of reducing the pain itself.

This will, perhaps, require a few seconds of time, to bring his Will-Power to bear directly and definitely and forcefully upon its task. But he will be surprised to note the fact that — in direct relation to his success in relaxing the nerves and muscles that would otherwise be twisted out of shape by the agony of pain, and in bringing his face to express the entire absence of pain, he will realize the fact that the pain itself becomes less poignant.

Perhaps there is not one of us who enjoys the manifestations of pain, or suffering, in others with whom we are in contact. Speak- ing for myself, it has occurred to me many a time, that I would rather endure the pain or the agony myself than to see the outward expression of it in others. And this charac- ter of vicarious suffering is so true and so real, that there are historic instances where men and women have suffered death from the agony of witnessing the outward manifesta- tions of suffering of those they loved.

But from the moment mother would greet her with: \"Good morning, Aunt Sally; how are you feeling today?\" — Aunt Sally's face became twisted into the outward expres- sion of the most intense suffering; her voice moved up the scale at least half-an-octave in pitch, and she pulled out the \"trembulo stop- ple\" (as our old colored Mammy used to say) and became a living, breathing, vibrating, pulsating expression of physical suffering. My mother, who was one of God's own fun- loving, big hearted, good natured, mischiev- ous students of psychology (without knowing it), understood Aunt Sally's case thoroughly. She knew that her apparent suffering was nothing but a chronic mental attitude. Be- cause of this, she often amused herself at poor old Aunt Sally's expense, by playing upon her hypochondriacal attitude of mind as to her martyrdom of suffering.

The kind of Cheerfulness, necessary to the accomplishment of these constructive results, is not of the variety that thrives, grows and matures only in the midst of the most invit- ing, salubrious and desirable conditions. Nor is it of the character that swings back and forth between happiness on the one hand and morbid misery on the other. It does not shine forth in every lineament of the face today, and withdraw itself behind a cloud of despondency tomorrow. It is of the character that is as firm, fixed and unwavering as the Soul Attitude of Poise itself.

That which constituted its vital- ity, vigor, strength and health is gone, and disintegration, decay and social Death follow with the logic of Fate. The same law holds good in the world of Religion. With very few exceptions, the re- ligions of earth are founded directly upon Faith alone.

His reported demonstrations of a mar- velous and bewildering power of healing the sick, under conditions and in a manner which mystified and amazed even the most learned men of his time, did more than almost any- thing else to establish his reputation as a \"miracle worker\". The fact that during the twenty centuries which have intervened since there \"came wise men from the East\" to Jerusalem that they might find Him and \"worship Him\" — history records no instance where His therapeutic knowledge and power have been equaled by any individual man, gives to Him and His work a place that is unique in human history."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Gurative (jFaith 255 Those who are familiar with the Scriptural narrative will recall the incident, narrated in the fifth chapter of Mark, wherein \"a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years — and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all she had, and was nothing better, but rather grew worse\" — (as many another woman has done since tnen, and as many another is still doing today, because our physicians — God bless them — know so little about the fundamental principles involved in the cure of disease) had such faith in the Master that she was sure she would be \"made whole\" if she could but touch His garment. Hence, she came near enough — through the press of the throng behind Him — to touch His garment. \"Straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed\", etc. But follow the narrative closely a little fur- ther, for it contains something of the most vital interest to all who are earnestly seeking for definite knowledge of the Natural Law by which such cures are possible."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"256 3-Carmonic Setf-^Unfoldment \"And Jesus, immediately knowing in him- self that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press and said: 'Who touched my clothes?' * 1 * And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. * * * And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.\" Note carefully the exact words of the Mas- ter. \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\" There is absolutely no uncertainty in the meaning of the words themselves. They sim- ply state a fact. Leave off the first word, and we have \"Faith hath made thee whole.\" From any view one may take of the statement, it is crystal clear to anyone who can understand the meaning of the simple words employed ; that faith was the curative agent Nature em- ployed, in this instance, to effect the cure. But there is another point to be observed, that is just as vitally important, if we desire to go to the very bottom of the problem, and learn the exact process involved in the thera- peutic activities Nature employed. It is this : It was not merely faith alone, in the abstract,"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Guiative ^Jaith 2r>7 that did the work. How do we know? Be- cause the Master said: \"Thy faith\". It was not His faith, nor the faith of Peter, John or Thomas — nor the faith of the great multitude who gathered about the Master. He said \"Thy\" faith. And just what does this mean? It means that it was the faith of the patient herself that gave to the faith the one specific ingredient necessary to make it constructively fruitful. And reducing this fact to its exact and scientific place in the therapeutic proc- ess, it means that wherever faith is the fun- damental activity employed, it is, and must ever be, the faith of the patient; quite as much as that of the healer — and in many instances more. Read the Scriptural narrative of the inci- dent again, and get the fact clearly in your mind — for it is vital, as well as significant. Note what a wonderful faith the woman had. It was so great and so all-powerful that she knew, without a doubt, that if she could only touch the Master's garment, she would be healed, made whole."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"25S ^Harmonic Q^elf-^nfoldvnent And so vital, so real and so powerful was the healing process that she \"f elt\" it ; for the narrative says: \"She felt in her body that she was healed.\" As a further evidence of the perfectly tan- gible nature of the process employed, note the interesting fact that the Master also was per- fectly aware of what had been done ; for the Master, Jesus, \"immediately knowing in him- self that virtue had gone out of him\", turned him about in the press of the throng around him, and said: \"Who touched my clothes?\" To obtain a perfectly clear and exact under- standing of the meaning of his experience, it is necessary to know the exact meaning of the word \"virtue\", as it is used in the Scrip- tural narrative. Luke, in his narration of the same incident, says, Chapter VI: \"And the whole multude sought to touch him; for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.\" And in Chapter VIII: \"And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me ; for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.\""},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Gurative rjaith 259 The sense in which the Master uses the word \"virtue\", does not signify \"chastity\", nor \"moral character\", as the term is so often employed in the consideration of moral and ethical principles. One of the classes of meanings given to the word in Webster's New International Dictionary, is \"energy, strength, potency, efficacy; as the virtue of a medicine\". In \"Rocfet's Thesaurus\", under the same head- ing are given, as synonyms: \"dynamic en- ergy, electricity, magnetism, electro-magnet- ism\" ; and also the terms \"power, potency, force, influence\", etc. Hence, when the Master said: \"I perceive that virtue is gone out of me\" — his purpose, without question, was to convey the informa- tion that he was conscious of the fact that a healing virtue, or magnetic energy, had gone out from his own body. This is an experience which every genuine magnetic healer under- stands. And, in many instances, this becomes a very real vital drain upon the magnetic re- sources of the healer. Those who follow the"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"260 ^Harmonic £elf- c llnfoldment business of magnetic healing find that they can treat only so many patients within a given time, for lack of sufficient vitality. They become utterly exhausted beyond that number, and find that their treatments are no longer of the same potency or value to the sick. Hence, when the Master felt that the heal- ing virtue had gone out from his own body, it was but natural, and quite consistent with the facts of Nature, that the woman who was thereby healed, should feel the healing virtue enter into her own body, and energize it until she knew she was healed — \"made whole\" again. But, in the light of these facts, why should the Master say to the woman: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole\" ? Is there an inconsistency here? By no means. In the process of healing through faith, the element of perfect faith makes of the phys- ical body a natural magnetic receiver. Scien- tifically, it polarizes the physical body from the positive to the receptive condition to mag-"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Gurative ^Jaith 261 netic energy. It becomes a natural magnetic sponge, as it were, and becomes a powerful absorbent of vital magnetism from its envi- ronment. The Master, being positively charged with vital energy, and the woman being polarized by her great faith into the receptive magnetic condition, the instant she was able to touch his clothing, the contact closed the circuit of magnetic energy, and with the perfect facility of Nature's process, a strong current of vital magnetism passed out of the body of the Master, and instantly flooded that of the woman ; and the work was done. And the Master therefore uttered a great scientific truth, when he said to the woman: \"Thy faith hath made thee whole\". Since it is the element of faith that polar- izes the physical body into a magnetically receptive state and condition, it does not re- quire a great intelligence to understand the simple fact that whatever awakens in one a sublime faith that he is going to be healed, and fully restored to health, instantly makes of his body a \"magnetic sponge\" or the recep-"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"262 ^Harmonic Q)alf- rr LLnfoldment tive pole of a strong vital magnet. It does not matter who or what it is that awakens that sublime, \"therapeutic\" faith. It may be the Master, or it may be a healer of any school or cult. The result is the same. The conditions are thereby established which flood the body of the patient with the vital energy necessary to restore it to normality. And this means that a cure has been made; the individual is \"healed\", and \"made whole\". In this will be found the logic of reason which explains the fact that healers of all kinds, schools and cults, count their cures in great numbers. The Christian Scientist prac- titioner, the magnetic healer, the mental healer, the metaphysical healer, the bread- pill doctor, all are entitled to consideration for the cures they effect — for they are all genuine \"healers\", insofar as they are able to awaken or establish within the souls of their patients the degree and quality of faith which carries with it the transfer of vital energy to the body of the patient. In every such in- stance it could be said, with equal truth, —"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Gurative (jFaith 265 \"Thy faith hath made thee whole\". For there are many kinds of ailments of the phys- ical body that result from destructive psycho- logical and mental conditions and states of being. Take, for illustration, the mentally morbid state of the hypochondriac. In course of time it will develop any one of the many illnesses that have their cause in so-called neurasthenia. The mental attitude produces nervous derangements of many kinds — in fact, virtually all kinds. All the vital organs of the bod} 7 are keenly sensitive to the vary- ing states and conditions of the nerves that control them. The nerves are keenly sensi- tive to the mental states and conditions of the individual. Hence, almost any disease that has its origin in the nerve body, may be either caused or cured by the mind. To those who are not familiar with the subject, it would be amazing to know definitely the per- centage of diseases that have their physical origin in the physical nerve organism.

All such cases, in truth, may be entirely ''healed\" by anyone who has the intelligence and ability to awaken in the patient that de- gree and quality of faith to which the Master referred when he said : \"Thy faith hath made thee whole.\" All this opens the way to a clear and intel- ligent understanding of how easily and how perfectly every mature individual with suffi- cient intelligence to understand the Law, may be taught to become his own healer. But, of far greater importance, he may learn how to prevent disease within himself, by the right exercise of his own soul powers. A right understanding of mental prophylactics, and simple obedience to the principle therein em- ployed, keep the physical body clean, pure, wholesome, and entirely free from every toxic poison, and enable Nature, the great Builder, to construct a perfect Temple for the living Soul, and keep it in perfect harmony with the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Gurative 'jFaith 265 Constructive Principle of Nature and thereby make it the happiest, sweetest and most de- lightful and attractive place in all the uni- verse for its owner and occupant.
