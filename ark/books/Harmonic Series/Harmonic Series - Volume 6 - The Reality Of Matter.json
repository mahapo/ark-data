D.\" These articles covered a wide range of subject matter, and purported to be the results of the personal travels of their author throughout Old India, and of his personal experiences among the Orientals and of his personal studies of Indian Phil- osophy, Religion and Science at first hand among the people. The chain of incidents and circumstances in this country leading up to the publication of these articles gave to them a special set- ting which had the effect of creating the most intense and wide-spread interest, not alone in America, but throughout the civil- ized world. The first of these articles appeared in 11"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"12 The Reality of Matter print just about the close of the great \"Congress of Religions\" which constituted one of the most interesting educational phases of \"The World's Columbian Expo- sition\", held in Chicago during the summer and autumn of 1893.

Mr. Hensoldt, therefore, chose a most propitious time and opportunity to intro- duce himself to the world at his own valu- ation, as an authority on the subjects covered by his series of magazine articles herein re- ferred to. His audience included virtually the progressive student body of our Western"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Prelude 13 Hemisphere, who had been specially pre- pared to receive him in the spirit of generous hospitality and unquestioning confidence. And this they did whole-heartedly. Surely this was an opportunity which comes to men not oftener than once in an average lifetime; and Mr. Hensoldt seemed specially equipped, by both native intelli- gence and training, to make the most of it in the interests of Truth. He is a writer of unusual ability, and possesses that subtle charm of lively idealism and personal magnetism which holds the interest and sympathy of his reader even through lofty flights of pure imagination. But there is a delicately refined, artfully devised, and mystically attuned something in the consciousness of man that seems to act automatically at times, and when it does so it seems to have psychic eyes which look through every conceivable disguise and can differentiate fiction from fact with unerring precision.

The writer of this \"Prelude\" was one of his most sympathetic and deeply interested readers. But long before he had finished his reading of the article there came to him the strong and definite conviction: 1. That Mr. Hensoldt had never been in India. 2. That insofar as the article purported to be an autobiographical sketch, it was a fiction pure and simple. 3. That instead of going personally to India, and there meeting the alleged great Adept, \"Coomra Sami\", and discussing with him the mysteries of Nature and of Life — as he had narrated with such a wealth of detail and interesting incident — he had only gone away into some quiet and safely obscure retreat, and there, with the aid of a vivid imagination and a few good books of '* Travels in India\" and '^Religions and Philosophies of the Orient'', had made \"Coomra Sami\" out of the \"dust of the"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Prelude 15 Soul\", blown into him the \"breath of his lively imagination\", pronounced him \"good enough\", and proceeded to \"learn\" from this brand-new, home-made \"Adept\", all the wonderful things found in the books he had been reading about India, and some other things of his own make, without admixture with Truth. But it was all very interesting, and with few exceptions was scientifically and phil- osophically \"true to the books\"; and con- sequently nobody was seriously injured; the public was entertained and instructed; Mr. Hensoldt made himself a reputation and some easy money, and laid a fine foun- dation for a series of public lectures to follow, and for more money and a wider reputation, ad lib. So strongly was the writer convinced of these things (and some others) that he was tempted to enter The Arena for the purpose of making a test of Mr. Hensoldt's knowl- edge, and the extent to which he had profited by the sublime philosophy he had"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"16 The Reality of Matter learned from the imaginary lips of his home- made \"Adept, — Coomra Sami\". To that end, the writer replied to one of Mr. Hensoldt's articles wherein he had made his imaginary \"Adept\" say: ''There is no such thing as matter. What you call the external world is no more real than the shadow of yonder rock. The things which you seem to behold around you are simply the products of your own mind.'' The result was the following discussion on the question of the reality or unreality of matter. Curiously enough, after my first article was written, there came to me one day through the mails, but truly as if it had dropped from the clouds, a carefully written letter, unsigned, bearing the postmark of an out-of-the-way village in the South, — telling me that Mr. Hensoldt had never been in India; that during the entire period covered by his alleged travels in the Orient he had been in the United States in the home of a personal friend of the writer of the letter; and that he"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Prelude 17 had obtained all the important data for his entire series of Arena articles from the library of the party in whose home he had s'pent the time covered by his supposed \"travels\", and from books he obtained from other libraries in the South.

As will be observed in my second article, it is \"suggested that doubts have been ex- pressed as to the existence of any such man as 'Coomra Sami' and that similar doubts have been expressed as to whether Mr. Hensoldt was ever really in India,\" etc., and that there might be some question as to his right to use the designation \"Ph.

At any rate he closed the con- troversy abruptly by failing to respond to my second article. I have to confess that he showed excellent judgment in thus depriving his critic of the opportunity to give to the public a much more definite and lucid statement and ex- position of the subject. I have also to confess my disappointment in that we had but fairly gotten started in the discussion of a most interesting and fruitful subject upon which the innocent public would seem to be in great need of \"More Light\". \"Matter\" has come to be a subject of profound interest in this Western World during recent years.

Like the hermits of the Middle Ages, these men live in austere seclusion; either in the solitude of India's great forests or in the hill country, always selecting some locality as remote as possible from the contingency of disturbance. The impenetrable jungle region along the Malabar coast of the Peninsula is full of these recluses, and they are numerous also in the hills of Mysore, in the Neilgherries, along the Nerbudda and Jumna, and even in the Rajputana Desert.

In my \"Wonders of Hindoo Magic\" (see December Arena) I have pointed out that these recluses may be divided into various classes, and that the Yoghis and Rishis are, practically, teachers or prophets, who have a mission to perform in their own country. They have sprung from a race of people who, for fifty centuries, have subordinated matter to mind, who have succeeded in reducing their physical wants to a minimum, who are all brain (while we are all stomach) , whose knowledge of the mysteries of the mind and life is far in ad- vance of that in our possession, who have spent years in introspective brooding over this great world illusion, who have acquired a mastery of telepathy or mind reading such as we can neither understand nor appreciate, and whose knowledge of the possibilities of what we call hypnotism is far ahead of anything of which we can now even conceive."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 The Reality of Matter These men, from time to time, will leave their hidden retreats in the jungle, or their mountain caverns, and suddenly appear in the cities, where at once they are surrounded by an interested crowd of spectators.

These men are engaged in a process of reaching a higher level of mentality. They live in the strictest seclusion, and never go about performing feats of any sort. They have been pronounced selfish by shallow reasoners, who are apt to inquire why the adepts, instead of seeking refuge in solitude, do not go about enlightening the world and proclaiming their occult attainments from the housetops. It may be urged in reply that this latter occupation does not form part of the adept's plan; in other words, he is not preparing to become a teacher of the people; if he were to do this he could not be what he is, nor reach the lofty heights to which he aspires.

The great principle which underlies the almost endless modifications of Hindoo occultism may be embodied in the term ''abstraction'', namely, the attainment of as complete a state of Introspective vision as possible, by the withdrawal of the senses of sight, hearing, touch, etc., from the ex- ternal world. Perhaps it will be of advan- tage to the reader, if I here describe a little more fully what is meant by Introspection.

Now, if his success depended on his power to reach complete abstraction, he would speedily dis- cover that he was far from reaching the desired goal; although he might secure soli- tude, he would not be able to exclude sound, for various noises are bound to reach and attract part of his attention, in spite of the most rigid application of his will. He might seek the solitude of some forest, or retire within the most secluded cavern, yet not be able to get rid of the disturbing element of sound. Assuming, however, that all sound were excluded, there are impres- sions of sight, which are an equal, if not a greater obstacle in the path of him who would seek to attain the introspective state. A single blade of grass, if it catches the eye, will start a train of thought which may embrace a thousand subjects; a caterpillar, a grain of sand, a rain-drop, will lead the mind into a labyrinth of reflections that are more or less involuntary."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"28 The Reality of Matter He might resort to the simple method of shutting his eyes, hoping thereby to get rid of the external world and reach the intro- spective state; futile effort — there still would remain the consciousness of the fact that objects of various kinds were surrounding him, which is a disturbing influence. Now, granting that the perceptions of sound, sight and even touch, could, for a time at least, be completely extinguished, there still would remain the memory of this or that sorrow, of frustrated hopes, of business troubles, of all the petty vexations and annoyances of life. Unless these also be completely annihilated, there can be no such thing as abstraction 'in the sense of the esoteric philosophy of India. The various methods followed by the student of occultism in the far East, from the Fakeer to the greatest Adept, have only this one sole aim, namely, the attainment of a state of complete introspection. When that condition is reached, so the masters say, \"The mind is a scroll upon which"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Occult Science in Thibet 29 nature will write\". In other words, the Gnostic in that state identifies himself with the Brahm or Universal Consciousness, and partakes, in a measure, of the divine attri- butes of omniscience as well as omnipotence. Among certain schools of Fakeers and low- grade initiates, the practice of crystal-gazing is largely followed as a means of enforcing the introspective condition. A piece of crystal, usually polished (Japanese balls of rock-crystal, about three inches in diameter, are in common use all over India) , is placed before the observer, who will seek some solitary spot and steadily gaze on the shin- ing surface. The reader may imitate this practice and the result will be a surprise and a revelation to him. The eye should be placed on a level with the crystal and about ten inches away from the latter; a light must be ad- justed sideways, so that its image is not in the line of vision, and a piece of black cloth should be suspended behind the crystal.

Of course, what he apparently sees in the crystal is in reality transpiring in his own mind; he has reached a degree of intro- spective vision, but is obliged to make use of some external, tangible object, which, for the time being, becomes his medium.

The true adept, however, who has at- tained to the highest pinnacles of esoteric wisdom, scorns to make use of these exter- nal and, to him childish, modes of intro- spection; he has come to recognize that the truth lies within the depth of his own con- sciousness, and that he can place himself in the abstract state within a few seconds by mere will-power; whereas the common Fakeer identifies the occult phenomena with the crystal, the mirror or the magic cup which he correspondingly reverences and regards with superstitious awe.

During the first few weeks of my stay among the adepts of Serinagur I regarded these men as very unsociable, morose and even uncivil, because they seldom uttered a word or even exchanged a greeting; it was not long, however, before I realized that, while apparently mute, these men carried on an active conversation with one another. They had simply risen above the necessity for speech.

The wonderful manner in which intelligence is communicated, or rather the speed with which news of an important character travels in the East, is a case in point. During the late Afghan war it in- variably happened that the news of any success or disaster to the British was known all over India long before the authorities at Calcutta were officially informed; thus, for instance, the details of the battle of Maiwand were discussed in the bazaars of Calcutta four days before the news was received at headquarters, to the utter amaze- ment of the vice-royal government. This in spite of the fact that the British had the advantage of sending dispatches by couriers down the valley of the Kabul river and through the Khyber Pass to Peshawur, and telegraphing cipher messages from there to Calcutta.

Why, the news of the great disaster which befell Napoleon's army at Moscow took over six weeks to reach Paris, and this at a time when postal communication was already well organized all over Europe; in India it would have been known all over the land in less than two hours, and not merely in the sense of a vague presentiment that something had happened, but in the shape of a distinct vision, which, although not seen by everybody, is beheld by tens of thousands who are not slow to communi- cate it to their fellow-men.

There is an overwhelming amount of evidence on record to show that these phenomena cannot be traced to mere coincidence, and the term \"cerebricity\" has been aptly formulated for this class of manifestations. The most plausible explanation of this mysterious phenomenon is the following, which, so far as my experience goes, Is practically a part of the Esoteric knowledge of the great Masters of India and Thibet.

The brain of the new-born babe is so poor in gray matter and convolutions that the ego can manifest itself but very feebly; as that wonderful organ develops in complexity of structure, new possibilities are added to the psychic power behind.

Now, if thought Is a molecular motion (modern science, as we know, reduces every- thing in \"nature\" to motion) then each par- ticular thought must start a wave motion, which is bound to radiate throughout space, and which, of course, must go through all brains. The reason why it affects only a certain brain, so as to produce consciousness, while leaving a thousand others indifferent, is very easily accounted for. Let the reader take a violin into a room where there is a piano and then with his bow strike a certain musical note, say G.

During the six months of my stay among the adepts of Serinagur I made a deter- mined, if not to say desperate effort to obtain a clew to some of their secrets. As I stated on a previous occasion, there is no such thing as a course of studies pre- scribed or laid down by the esoterics, which will enable the neophyte in the course of time to cast a glimpse behind the mysterious \"curtain\".

Now it may be taken for granted that fully nine- tenths, if not more, of these are actuated by no other motive than that of mere curiosity on the one hand, and on the other, the desire for occult powers which will enable them more readily to attain the goal of their more or less sordid ambitions.

Indeed, I may say that nothing has more forcibly impressed me than the conscientiousness of these singular individuals with regard to the responsi- bility of their position as esoteric initiates, or adepts of a higher science, and their extreme hesitancy to admit outsiders, as expressed in the almost incredible precau- tions which they take in order to guard against a possible abuse of their precious trust.

This truth, of course, is apt to startle you, as it has startled all the learned incapables of Frank- istan who have taken great pains to prove, in bulky volumes, that the external world is real, because they can see objects with what they call their own eyes, touch them with their own hands and perceive sound by means of their own long ears. They forget that it is not the eye that sees, the hand that touches and the ear that hears, but the mind — or let us say the brain, because you like this term better; like all Franks you are a great believer in words that con- vey no meaning.

Mr. Hensoldt has recently clearly, ably and entertainingly written upon the same general theme a number of articles which have been read with critical interest by progressive thinkers throughout the civil- *See pages 21 to 56 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 59 ized world. In all of these articles the crystal-clear integrity and good conscience of the author are strongly attested, and let it be distinctly understood at the outset that this letter does not contain one word which is intended to impeach, in the small- est degree, his good faith and honesty of purpose. Mr. Hensoldt does not pretend, however, to have passed behind the mystic veil of the initiate, nor claim to speak with author- ity beyond that acquired by personal ob- servation from a strictly external point of vision. He is, therefore, in position to understand and appreciate the fact that some of his impressions and interpretations may not be strictly accurate, or that his use of language may have added here and there a shade of meaning not contemplated by the Hindoo whose thoughts he has en- deavored to reflect, although he stands fully acquitted of any intent to misrepresent.

With that thought in mind I shall endeavor to free myself from the embarrassment of seeming to invite antagonism or controversy. I seek only to establish truth. At page 374* of The Arena Mr. Hensoldt quotes from Coomra Sami, among other things, the following words: — \"What you have to get rid of, in the first instance, is this fundamental delusion of matter. There is no such thing as matter. What you call the external world is no more real than the shadow of yonder rock. The things which you seem to behold around you are simply the products of your own mind Again at page 377 f: — \"We (Hindoos) know that the so-called Page 44 & 45 of this volume. tSee page 53."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 61 external world is not real What you call matter exists only in your mind, and it can not be too often repeated that the fact of our being able to see or touch a thing does not prove its existence.\" And again at page 378*: — \"And here we come back to the eternal truth, namely, that your so-called world after all is maya or illusion, etc.\" I call attention to these extracts as an expression of the central thought about which the Hindoo is reported to have woven much more by way of explanation, illustra- tion and elucidation. The central thought, however, is the specific subject-matter to which I desire to address myself; and in this connection I trust that Mr. Hensoldt will not hold me in contempt for the violation of common courtesies, nor adjudge me guilty of incivility when I say that such is not the philosophy of the Mystic Brotherhood. They have never taught, nor have they intended to teach that \" There is no such thing as matter'', *See page 56 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 The Reality of Matter nor that ''matter is only a delusion''. How this radical misinterpretation of so fundamental a principle in the philosophy may have occurred, I do not pretend to know; but I do know that it is a mistake which does the gravest injustice to the Brotherhood as well as to their philosophy and teaching. Other misinterpretations of their philosophy have gone before the world, but none more radically at variance with the facts than this. The very fact that there are today but thirty-three active living masters of the Inner Temple of the Mystic Brotherhood, that their lives are from necessity very exclusive, that there are so few who could be entrusted with the knowledge they possess, makes access to them most difficult. This in turn has led to a wide range of vague, indefinite and exaggerated rumors concerning their lives, their habits, customs, knowledge and phil- osophy which have been published to the world as facts, but many of which are fiction pure and simple."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood oj India 63 As to this particular article under con- sideration, I could not and do not expect the readers of this paper to accept my un- corroborated statement in p-eference to that of Mr. Hensoldt, and had I relied upon such evidence alone I should never have opened the door of controversy. There are, how- ever, certain remarkable inconsistencies in the body of the article itself which the careful, thoughtful student can not fail to recognize, but which might readily pass un- challenged by the casual reader. To one or two of these only, let me direct your attention : — 1. At page 376* of The Arena the fol- lowing quotation, ipsissimus verbis, from Coomra Sami appears without qualifications, viz. : — \"We (Hindoos) live on rice, and most of us are satisfied with one meal a day. A teacup full of boiled rice, with a little salt is all that we need in the line of food. One piece of cloth, which will last us for years, *See page 51 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64 The Reality of Matter is all the raiment we need, and as for shelter, why, a few bamboo sticks thatched with palm leaves will more than sufifice.\" It is but courtesy as well as justice to Mr. Hensoldt to assume that these are, in truth, the exact words of the Hindoo. But now let us apply to them the simple test of the philosophy that \"matter is a delu- sion\". In that event, to be entirely con- sistent with his philosophy, the Hindoo should have said something like this: — \"We imaginary beings (Hindoos) think we live on a cereal fantasy (rice), and most of us imagine ourselves satisfied with one such delusion (meal) a day. An illusion (teacup) full of boiled cereal fantasy (rice), with a little epiphany (salt) as an imagi- nary condiment with which to fool our supposed sense of taste, is all we need in the line of gustatory deception (food). One piece of misconception (cloth) which will last us for a number of delusions of time (years), is all the nothing (raiment) we need. And as for the phantom (shelter)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 65 why, a few bamboo imaginations (sticks) thatched with palm-nonentities (leaves), will more than suffice.\" Again at page 377* the Hindoo is quoted as follows: \"While you have been working for the stomach, we have been working for the brain.\" But had he been entirely con- sistent with his delusional philosophy, he should have said something like this: \"While you have been working for that imaginary pocket in the middle of your hallucinatory anatomy, called a stomach, we have been working for the more exalted delusion in the mistaken apex of our im- aginary craniums, called a brain.\" While there is necessarily an element of absurdity in the foregoing amended ren- dition of the Hindoo's language, my pur- pose is not to ridicule the author, but only to illustrate more vividly the fact that the very words employed by the Hindoo to express his thought, are in themselves a palpable contradiction of the philosophy *See page 52 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66 The Reality of Matter which Mr. Hensoldt's article would teach. The same contradiction may be observed in almost every sentence uttered by the Hindoo. For illustration: he speaks of the city of Thibet, of the Himalayan heights, of his heart, of wealth, luxury, cattle, animality, his race, the Vale of Kashmir; of the hand, eye, ear and brain; of horses, stones, trees, rubbish, material possessions, property and the eternal stars; of physical suffering and physical character as distinguished from mental suffering and spiritual character; of material culture as distinguished from spirit- ual culture, and of many other purely physical things, in such terms as tacitly to acknowledge their existence in a world not of the spirit. And yet, with all these accumulated evidences of his unqualified recognition of physical nature, he is made to say, \"What you call matter exists only in your own mind.\" \"There is no such thing as matter.\" To the mind of the thoughtful reader the inconsistency must be"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 67 apparent, and to the careful, analytical scientist it is, of itself, a sufficient condem- nation of the fallacy. 2. If one were left to draw his conclu- sion from the words of the Hindoo alone, as they appear in the article under con- sideration, it would seem that the one central and supreme object to be attained by a student in this school of magic, is the mystic art of dispelling \"the delusion of matter\". Coomra Sami tells us that this funda- mental delusion is the chief obstacle in the pathway of the initiate, and goes so far as to draw comparisons between the wisdom of the Western world and that of the Orient, much to the advantage of the East. From his exposition of the philosophy, if one would attain the exalted position of an adept, he must first divest himself of this \"fundamental delusion of matter\". He must rise to a point of spiritual perception where \"There is no such thing as matter\". Upon this point one's scepticism is, in a"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68 The Reality of Matter manner, disarmed by the author's state- ment that \"Coomra Sami was one of those high grade adepts who had come as near perfection in the line of occult wisdom as probably any Hindoo initiate from the time of the great Sakyamuni\". If this be true, it follows \"as the night the day\" that in so far as he is concerned \"There is no such thing as matter\". In so many words he tells us so; but how shall we reconcile this with the fact that, even he, after having reduced his wants to a minimum, still eats rice, wears clothes, and lives beneath the shelter of bamboo sticks thatched with palm leaves} All these things the Hindoo tells us are necessaries even in his own life. But what are rice, clothes, bamboo sticks and palm leaves} They are either matter or delusions. If matter, they completely disprove the \"delusion\" theory; but if, on the other hand, they are only delusions, then, by his own mouth, Coomra Sami stands convicted of eating delusions, wearing delusions, and living under the protecting shelter of a de-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 69 luslon, all of which, to a man of his pro- found wisdom and great power, must be a most humiliating confession of his own in- sufficiency, or a like confession of the error of his philosophy. Whichever position we take there is an irreconcilable Inconsistency which condemns the philosophy. 3. As additional or cumulative evidence that matter has no existence in fact, Mr. Hensoldt at page 378* of his article asks the Hindoo this question: \"Do you really mean to say that these eternal hills and the fertile plains beyond, have no existence, except In my own mind?\" To this, after giving Mr. Hensoldt a singular look and •waving his hand, Coomra SamI replies: \"These eternal hills, where are they now?\" Mr. Hensoldt then says: \"And as I turned my gaze from the adept's eyes In the direc- tion of the snow-clad Himalayas I was amazed to find myself gazing upon va- cancy; the eternal hills and the fertile plains had vanished into thin air, and noth- *See page 55 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 The Reality of Matter ing was before me but a vast expanse of space; even the solid rock beneath our feet seemed to have disappeared, although I felt as if treading some invisible ground.

'' It will be observed from the foregoing that Mr. Hensoldt says: \"The illusion lasted fully eight or ten minutes,\" etc., from which it would appear that notwithstanding the words of the adept, he, at least, re- cognizes the fact that the disappearance of the eternal hills constitutes the illusion in this case, and that their reappearance is, in fact, the reality. Such, at least, is the truth.

I have said that notwithstanding many misinterpretations of the philosophy and teachings of the Mystic Brotherhood, and many fallacies concerning their life and work have been published to the world during the past few years; yet nothing has ever appeared in print more radically un- just to them and their philosophy than the allegation of Coomra Sami that they deny the existence of matter. So widely is this at variance from the very basic and elementary principle of their philosophy, that I am impelled to give a brief statement of their true position upon the question under consideration. Instead of believing or teaching that \"There is no such thing as matter,\" or that \"what we call matter exists only in the mind\" — the very foundation rock upon which the superstructure of their entire"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"72 The Reality of Matter philosophy rests, is the great, universal truth that matter exists everywhere. Not only is the physical universe a uni- verse of matter, but the same is equally true of the world of spirit. Both are material in the most exact and literal mean- ing of that word. The spirit of an indi- vidual is as truly a material organism as is the physical body which envelops it. Both are matter, the one physical and the other spiritual. \"Physical material\" and \"spirit- ual material\" are, in truth, the identical terms employed by the masters to distin- guish between the two worlds of matter. But if it be true that both are, in fact, material worlds, the question may properly be asked : Wherein exists the difference, and what is the necessity for any such distinction? The one belongs to the world of purely physical things, and is therefore designated by the very appropriate term, \"physical matter\". The other belongs to the world of purely spiritual things, and is therefore designated by the equally fitting term,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 73 \"spiritual matter\". For a similar reason we designate that which belongs to the mineral kingdom as \"mineral\", and that which belongs to the vegetable kingdom as \"vegetable\", but the one is as truly material as the other. In this case, however, both belong to the world of physical material, and are but sub- divisions of it. But what are the real differences between a vegetable and a min- eral by means of which the physical scientist may distinguish the one from the other? These are too well known to require analysis or definition in this letter, and I therefore take for granted that they are familiar to the reader. It is equally true, however, that there are certain distinguishable dififer- ences existing in physical and spiritual organisms which enable the spiritual scien- tist — or the master — to determine with equal accuracy to which world of matter any given organism or body belongs. What are some of these distinguishable differences? 1. One which may be mentioned is, the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"74 The Reality of Matter degree of fineness — or the relative size of the individual particles of which a body is com- posed. Let me see if I can make this clear. Suppose, for illustration, you take an ordi- nary gallon measure and fill it to the brim with marbles of the ordinary size used by children at play. Now it is not difficult for you to understand that, although it will hold no more marbles, the measure is not, in fact, full. There are many vacant spaces between these marbles, which may be filled in without running the measure over, provided we select a substance, the particles of which are fine enough to sift into these vacant spaces. Now suppose you try number six shot. You will find that you can put into the measure several handfuls of shot without running it over. Why is this? Because the shot are smaller than the vacant spaces between the marbles. You have now poured in all the shot the measure will hold, but you can readily understand that the measure is not yet full."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 75 There yet remain smaller spaces between the shot which are still vacant. Now put in ordinary white, dry sand, and you will find that the measure, though full as it will hold of marbles and shot, will still re- ceive several handfuls of the sand. Why? Because the vacant spaces between the shot are larger than the grains of sand. But you have now put in all the sand the measure will hold. Is it full? No. You may now pour in over a pint of water. Why? Because the particles of which water is composed are much finer than the vacant spaces between the particles of sand, and the water has only run into these vacant spaces. It now begins to look as if the measure were, in reality, full; but not so.

We will now turn into the vessel a current of electricity, and we find that we still have room for an amount sufficient to charge the entire contents of the measure. But what is electricity?

Another distinguishable difference be- tween physical material and spiritual ma- terial is found in the rate of vibratory motion of the atom in the compound. Let me see if I can make myself under- stood on this point. Take a piece of granite, set it before you, look at it care- fully and see if you can discover any vibra- tory movement among the Individual crys- tals of which It is composed. No; you are ready to declare that, so far as you can dis- cover, they are absolutely at rest; but not so. Science has discovered that the Indi- vidual particles of which a stone is com- posed are In a constant state of vibratory motion one upon the other. But this vibratory motion of the atom in the com- pound Is, In the case of stone, at such a low rate that it is not perceptible to the physical sense of sight, and as a result the piece of granite appears to be a solid, Immovable, impenetrable mass of dead matter."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"78 The Reality of Matter Now take a piece of growing wood. Examine it as carefully as possible with the naked eye.

But notwithstanding that the rate of this vibratory motion is much greater than that in the case of stone, it is still not great enough to disturb the physical sense of vision. The result is that wood, like stone, appears to the naked eye, a solid, dead substance. To save both time and space, we will now pass over several intermediate substances such as animal flesh, gelatine, etc., and ex- amine a drop of water.

Let us take another step forward and we come to the gases.

In other words, a gas is invisible only because the atoms of which it is composed vibrate so rapidly that the physical sense of sight is unable to follow them.

These thought-pictures, which present themselves to us as material objects, are practically alike in the great majority of individuals, so that what /, for instance, am accustomed to call a \"stone\" would be called by a like term all over the world. It is only when we come to de- scribe these objects very closely that we discover — to our own amazement — that the stone we behold is not the stone seen by another, and if ten million pairs of eyes were apparently gazing upon the self-same \"object\", there would be ten million \"ob- jects\". Take an ordinary farmer and an artist (painter) into a forest, and let them de- scribe what they see around them. The result would be a revelation to many shallow reasoners and \"students\" of occultism who now insist upon making themselves ridicu- lous by delivering oracular opinions on subjects which they have never philoso- phically investigated. The farmer would"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"A Plea for Pantheism 117 see things to which the artist is absokitely blind, whereas the artist would be impressed with objects of which the farmer never dreams; they would, in fact, behold two essentially different worlds, because their minds are not the same.

Or take a ploughboy into a botanical garden and let him see an interesting assort- ment of strange plants and flowers.

In other words, if we can grind down material particles to a sufficient degree of minuteness we arrive at the phenomenon of mindl This Is only a more illogical presentation of the doctrine of modern materialism, viz., that mind is the result of certain atomic or molecular groupings of matter.

Then we may pour in a pint of water, which will find its way into the still smaller interstices be- tween the sand grains, and this water again will hold a quantity of alcohol, without increase of its bulk.

In my former article, to which the reader is respectfully referred, there are certain declarations of fact and principle, which— although presented in the spirit of fraternal kindness, and couched in terms of respectful consideration— seem to have been construed by Mr. Hensoldt, most unhappily, as an offense of such magnitude as to warrant him in converting what should have been *See pages 87 to 126 of this volume. 127"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"128 The Reality of Matter a cordial, courteous, and honest considera- tion of a most worthy and interesting sub- ject, into an exhibition of ill-temper, cha- grin and ridicule.

It would seem that anger and ridicule should have no place in a discussion be- tween men who claim to be sincere, and to have in view an ambition no less worthy than the establishment of truth.

All that portion of \"A Plea for Panthe- ism\", therefore, which indicates only the personality of its author and his unhappy frame of mind, will be passed by without further comment, and only the lesser (but more important) portion of his article which may be deemed to have any bearing upon the subject under consideration, will be considered.

For the purpose of giving the reader a general idea of the real value of such an assertion, coming from a man who does not claim to have been more than a mere traveler sojourning for a time in India, it may be valuable to note that the compiled statistics of 1891 disclose the fact that at that time British and Native India covered *See page 91 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 131 an area of about 1,600,000 square miles of territory, much of which it will be admitted is exceedingly mountainous, with a popu- lation of more than 286,000,000, of which about 61,000,000 are under control of native princes. It is also a matter of general report that the civilization of this remarkable country dates back several thousand years before the Christian era. In view of the foregoing data, and with Mr. Hensoldt's unqualified assertions in mind, it would be interesting to know from what particular point of observation he has been able to examine, with such un- erring precision, so vast a region of country; and through what channels of acquaint- anceship he has come into sufficient personal relations with more than 286,000,000 of people to be warranted in asserting as a fact that among all their number \"There is no such thing as a Brotherhood of India.\" It would be still more interesting to know something of the subtle and insidious process by which, from the standpoint of"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"132 The Reality of Matter this nineteenth century, he has acquired that character of definite knowledge which warrants him in deliberately asserting as a fact that ''Neither at the present day nor at any previous period did there exist an organi- zation of any kind whatsoever.''

Since Mr. Hensoldt admits there are adepts, he would not question their ability to guard their personality, plans, and purposes, as well as their local habitation, from the people in general or curious travelers in particular."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 133 The writer, in a former article, without intending to offend, and with no thought of invoking a controversy, stated that the Brotherhood of India is a bona fide and definite organization.

If called upon to prove his assertions It Is possible that he might find it no easy task. The original proposition which consti- tuted the basis of this discussion was the reported assertion of ''Coomra Sami\" that \"There is no such thing as matter\".

To this point the doctor at page 172* of his last article replies, that, \"Coomra Sami, being endowed with a rational mind would speak of rice, salt and food, as if these things had a posi- tive existence,\" etc. This may be very satisfactory to Mr. Hensoldt, but, with due deference to his conception of a \"rational mind\", it entirely misses the point. The question to be an- swered is not how or in what manner \"Coomra Sami\" would speak of these things, but why he should speak of them at all if they do not exist.

They are either matter or delusions. If matter, they disprove the delusion theory; if de- lusions, then by his own confession the Hindoo stands convicted of eating delusions, wearing delusions, etc. Not only this; he admits that these de- lusions are sufficiently substantial in their nature and of so much importance in his physical economy that after reducing his"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"138 The Reality of Matter wants to a minimum, he still finds them necessary to sustain physical life. \"Coomra Sami\" is made to say in effect that there is no such thing as rice ; but if that be true, why does he find rice necessary to sustain life, and why does he continue to eat it? If there is no such thing as clothes, why does he continue to wear them? If bamboo sticks and palm-leaves do not exist, why does he, in the exercise of a \"rational mind\", take the trouble and pains to weave them together into a shelter?

He asks the Hindoo this question: \"Do you really mean to say that these eternal hills and the fertile plains beyond have no existence, except in my own mind?\" After giving him a singular look and waving his hand, \"Coomra Sami\" replies, \"These eternal hills, where are they now?\" Proceeding with his narrative the doctor then says: \"And as I turned my gaze from the adept's eyes in the direction of the snow-clad Himalayas I was amazed to find myself gazing into vacancy; the eternal hills and fertile plains had vanished into thin air, and nothing was before me but a vast expanse of space; even the solid rock beneath our feet seemed to have disap- *See page 55 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"140 The Reality of Matter peared, although I felt as if treading upon invisible ground.

Whatever may have been his opinion, however, it is of little significance as compared with a proper interpretation of the meaning of his experience with Coomra Sami and the eternal hills; for, assuming that he has given a truthful account of this interesting but not unusual episode, his testimony is especially valuable in that *See page 124 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"142 The Reality of Matter it seems to establish two very important facts, viz., (1) that Coomra Sami is a hyp- notist of no mean ability, and (2) that Mr. Hensoldt is a remarkably susceptible sub- ject of hypnotic influence.

In this connection it will be observed that \"Coomra Sami\" gave Mr. Hensoldt a singular look, which is precisely what any other hypnotist would have done to catch the attention of his subject; and waving his hand, an act which is quite familiar to every person who has witnessed exhi- bitions of hypnotic control; and then real- izing that he had the mastery of his sub- ject's mind, he said \"These eternal hills, where are they now?\" in such manner as to suggest to his subject's mind the thought that the eternal hills had disappeared."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 143 All this time the adept's eyes were fast- ened upon his subject — in strict conformity with the practices of our Western hypnot- ists—for Mr. Hensoldt says, \"and as I turned my gaze from the adept's eyes\"; and true to his master's suggestion the hills had gone, for he says, \"I was amazed to find myself gazing into vacancy\". This is indeed a vivid picture of the external process by which a professional hypnotist obtains control of his subject's mind. Turning now to the impressions which the hypnotic influence made on himself, Mr. Hensoldt says: \"I felt as if treading some invisible ground; the sensation was wierd in the extreme\". This corresponds identically with the testimony of other hypnotic subjects, and is doubtless as fair an expression of the sensation as could well be put into words.

At pages 167 and 168* of his last article, he says, \"One of the greatest triumphs of the human mind, and beyond comparison the most important step hither- to taken towards the solution of the world- enigma, was the discovery that an object implies a subject; i. e., that any given ob- ject, for instance a tree, cannot by any possible stretch of imagination, be said to exist unless there be at the same time an eye to see or a hand to touch it — in other words, a mind to conceive it.\" The real significance of this remarkable \"discovery\" may be better understood when the fact is pointed out that by and through *See page 106 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"146 The Reality of Matter it man discovered his own existence. This fact does not appear upon the surface, but doubtless will become apparent a little later on: It was one fine morning within that dim and distant past that a philosopher of \"far- off Hindoostan\" went forth into the forest to philosophize and \"ponder over life's riddle\" and solve, if possible, the \"world- enigma\". He saw a tree, and forthwith he proceeded to philosophize and \"ponder over life's riddle\", and this is the manner of his reasoning: \"I see a tree.

To be sure, the tree is the ob- ject, and I had to have it as a starting- point and basis of my entire chain of reason- ing. Moreover, I do not know how I should be able to see or think or reason at all without something to see or think about or reason upon; nevertheless, since I am unable to reason out an existence for the tree, I am led to conclude that, as a matter of fact, there is no tree.

A CARTESIAN BEAR At this juncture, while the philosopher is writing out his conclusions on a dried palm-leaf, to be transcribed as a supplement to the Vedas, a bear steps out from behind the tree. The noble philosopher, fully satis- fied that he has successfully reasoned matter quite out of existence, says to himself: *T will now try this new philosophy on the bear, and see if it works as nicely on him as it did on the tree\"; and then he begins: \"I see a bear.

After satisfying his appetite, he picks his teeth with a broken bone and \"ponders over life's riddle,\" and this is his summary of the great problem: \"I am. The philosopher was. I ami The philosopher is notl If he had only been a sensible philosopher and brought his gun, he might still be. As it is, I conclude that I am the philosopher myself.\" And as he shambles off behind the tree to wait for another philosopher of the Oriental school of theoretical wisdom, he chuckles to himself, and in a baritone voice remarks, \"What fools these mortals be!\" It must be regretted that Bruin did not append another supplement to the Vedas. His practical philosophy would have been a great boon to humanity."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"\"I Am!

At page 170* of his \"Plea\" the pun- gent doctor delivers himself of these words: \"It inexorably follows, if what we term death completely terminates the existence of the individual, viz., extinguishes the mind, the world will disappear too, as jar as the individual in question is con- cerned ^ This remarkable deduction deserves more than passing consideration. Briefly stated, the proposition is as follows, viz., \"If death extinguishes the mind, the world will disappear as far as that particular mind is concerned.\" It will be observed that the premise of this interesting proposition is the hypothesis, \"// death extinguishes the mind.\" But at page 174t of his last article Mr. Hensoldt makes the unqualified statement that ''Mind is eternal and indestructible.'' And the writer is inclined to believe he is correct. Since mind is eternal and in- destructible, however, and Mr. Hensoldt *See page 113 of this volume. tSee page 125."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"152 The Reality of Matter is aware of that fact, wherein is there any room for his assumption that it may be extinguished'' \\ A proper syllogism upon this subject would be something like this: \"Mind is eternal and indestructible. A thing that is eternal and indestructible cannot be ex- tinguished. Therefore, mind cannot he ex- tinguished''. In this event the hypothesis that mind may be extinguished is a false premise; and if a premise is false, who is there rash enough to vouch for the truth of any conclusion based upon it? Since \"mind is eternal and indestructible\" we must accept it as a fact, and all our reason- ing upon it must be upon the basis of its existence and not upon the possibility df its extinguishment. It is safe to say that an extinguished mind is a commodity never heard of until \"A Plea for Pantheism\" appeared. Mind, in its most positive state of existence, is sufficient to elude the powers of the most learned. Not until men have been able"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 153 to analyze existing minds can we hope to deal with the \"extinguished\" ones. But let us consider Mr. Hensoldt's hy- pothesis from another point of view. In substance he tells us that if death extin- guishes the mind, the world will disappear as far as that particular mind is concerned. This is only another form of saying that a mind which does not exist cannot see the world. In o'ther words, \"A nonentity is blind.\" This is the reductio ad absurdum of the learned doctor's wisdom. It only re- mains for him to write himself down as the \"Supreme Grand Patron of the Oriental Order of Extinguished Minds\" to complete his fame. There is yet another point of observation from which to examine this very remark- able proposition: It would appear that, in order to reason matter out of existence, Mr. Hensoldt is first compelled to extin- guish mind. But while mind exists it is forced to take cognizance of the existence of matter."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"154 The Reality oj Matter Properly appreciated, this only serves to emphasize the wonderful tenacity with which matter asserts its own existence. In truth, it is so persistent of existence that the learned doctor of philosophy cannot reason it out of existence without at the same time extinguishing himself. Verily, matter is a stubborn fact. 6. We now come to the acme of Oriental wisdom, wherein, at page 174* of his \"Plea\", the acute doctor informs us that, \"the very fact of our inability to define matter is, in itself, a proof that matter has no positive existence.\" This is indeed a new rule by which to determine the existence or non- existence of things. Now let us apply it to mind. In the next paragraph he tells us that \"Mind is the only reality\", that it is \"eternal and indestructible.\" Suppose we admit it. Then If his rule is correct, he should be able to define it. If so, will he kindly favor his readers with the definition? See page 124 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 155 If, however, he is not able to define it, what then? In that event, what becomes of mind? It is hoped that the learned doctor will rise to this emergency, and, by the rule he has invoked to annihilate matter, save us from the calamity which must befall mind in the event of his failure. 7. At page 171* Mr. Hensoldt tells us that \"If ten million pairs of eyes were apparently gazing upon the self-same ob- ject, there would be ten million objects.\" This philosophy, it must be admitted, possesses the merit of economy as well as novelty, and deserves to be recommended to the practical business world for its great utility. For illustration; A citizen of Boston desires to erect a brown-stone resi- dence. He finds it both expensive and in- convenient to cut and transport ten thous- and stones from a distant quarry. He therefore procures one stone at a cost of, say $2.00 Then he invites the good citi- zens of Boston to come out and look at *See page 116 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"156 The Reality of Matter this stone with their 10,000 \"pairs of eyes\", and instantly he has stones enough to complete his building. He procures a barrel of cement for $3.75, and calls his friends to look at it, and his cement is multiplied accordingly. On this plan his materials for a residence ordinarily costing $275,000 might easily be procured for about $5.75. This is truly a practical philosophy But let us state the proposition again: \"If ten million pairs of eyes were apparently gazing upon the self-same object there would be ten million objects.\" Now, that being settled, will Mr. Hen- soldt kindly tell us how many eyes there would be? Also whether these eyes are realities or delusions? These are important questions, and should not be evaded nor ignored. Moreover, if a stone is merely an idea and nothing more, why does this doctor of philosophy find it necessary to have even one stone for his \"million pairs of eyes\" to \"gaze upon\"? Why not have those"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 157 million minds think of a stone? Or, to serve the interests of economy, why not have one mind think of the entire million? The result would certainly be the same, if objects are truly nothing more than mental concepts. If physical objects are only concepts of the mind, how easily every poor, hungry, suffering tramp in the country might pro- vide himself a mansion and surround him- self with all the comforts and luxuries of life. But, alas! the most vivid concept is in- sufficient to sustain physical life or banish the bitter blasts of winter. Even a \"Coomra Sami\" must eat rice or die, and must wear clothes and find shelter, 'neath bamboo-sticks and palm leaves, or suffer. 8. Atpagel71*,Mr.Hensoldtsays: \"Take a plowboy into a botanical garden and let him see an interesting assortment of strange plants and flowers. He will gaze upon them as he would upon vacancy; for, to *See page 117 of this volume."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"158 The Reality of Matter him, a plant is simply a 'plant' and a flower a 'flower' \". \"Now take a flower and explain to that boy all about its wonderful structure, about the anthers and pistils, about the ovaries, about the meaning of the petals, and the wonderful relations between insects and flowers. Teach him that the plant pro- duces the flower for no other purpose than to attract the insect, in order to make a tool of it in effecting cross-fertilization. What is the result? Why, you have altered that hoys mind, and he now sees a thousand things of which he did not dream before — which to him did not exist.\" Not so! He sees the same flower as before, but he thinks of all these other things. He does not see the insect nor the process of cross-fertilization. He only thinks he sees them. He does not see the plant produce the flower. He simply thinks of that fact while he sees the flower. He does not know that \"the plant produces the flower for no other purpose than to attract"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"The Brotherhood of India 159 the insect\"; nor does Mr. Hensoldt, for that matter. He only thinks so. Suppose the boy were blind. He might still be taught all these things, and occupy his mind in thinking of them, but he would never see the flower. And yet, it is safe to say, he would exchange all this knowledge for just one look upon the beauties of physical nature. To follow the eminent doctor through his mystic maze of theoretical inconsis- tencies would require much more space than the merit of his logic deserves. The way was left open for him to have disarmed his critic by a single sentence, and it was fully expected he would do so. Had he understood the true meaning of Oriental philosophy, he would have readily observed that \"Coomra Sami\", in asserting that \"there is no such thing as matter\", did not intend that his words should be subject to a literal construction. It is probable in whatever terms the Hindoo expressed his thoughts, he intended"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"160 The Reality of Matter to convey the idea that physical bodies and organisms are but an expression of spiritual forces in terms of physical matter. For illustration: The physical body of man is but the objective expression, in terms of physical matter, of those higher spiritual forces which are back of it. A man is accustomed to say \"my hand, my heart, my head, my body\", in such manner as clearly to indicate that he does not consider either or all of them combined as constituting himself. He is something separate and apart from his physical body. In other words, the soul, the ego, the mind, is something different from and above the plane of physical matter, and consti- tutes what we are wont to term the \"real man\". Had Mr. Hensoldt placed such a construction upon the words of \"Coomra Sami\", instead of measuring them by their literal significance, he would doubtless have more fairly represented his instructor's in- tentions.

The bones and tissues of the human body are composed of elements which may have been gathered from every quarter of the globe.

That which constitutes an integral part of the human heart today may perchance, in other years, have had a place in the heart of an oak or the petal of a rose. A particle of gray matter which today is doing service in the brain of a doctor of philos- ophy, may one hundred years hence be serving a tadpole in the same capacity. And thus, in the sense of its transitory nature, matter may very properly be termed illusory. But this does not mean non est.

In conclusion: It will be remembered that my former article was strictly confined to a discussion of the subject of matter. To verify this fact the reader is respectfully referred to the article itself, and asked to examine it carefully. In my exposition of the position of the Brotherhood upon this fundamental subject of matter, which will be found commencing at page 761* of the November Arena, it will be observed that the subject of mind is nowhere alluded to.

Thus far the writer has not entered upon a discussion of mind, for the reason that mattery was the subject under consideration. He would add, after extending the hand of fraternal good-fellowship in taking leave of the genial doctor, that if time and oppor- tunity permit, it is his hope to publish a work upon \"The Philosophy of Life\" which it is believed will be of service to those who are seeking for a practical self-development as taught by The Brotherhood of India."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"164 The Reality of Matter EDITOR'S NOTE To the foregoing Mr. Hensoldt never responded.

It is a decade and a half since I first read in The Arena, of Boston, the Hensoldt articles, beginning in December 1893 and ending with \"A Plea for Pantheism\" in the April number, 1895. I was at first both amazed and delighted that a German \"Doctor of Philosophy\" could be so hospitable toward \"Hindoo Magic\", the \"Adepts of Serinagur\" and the \"Secret Doctrine of the Brahmins\". \"The Fate of Major Rogers\", rather stag- gered my credulity, but in view of the claim of a number of years and extensive travels 165"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"166 The Reality of Matter devoted to the exploration of mountain fastnesses and study with Indian Sages, I withheld judgment.

On receiving reply I accepted his terms naming a date over two weeks distant, and offered the hospitality of my home for the occasion. Within three days, (to my surprise) he arrived in Cincinnati and came at once to my home, and was my guest for two weeks.

Among a lot of my old books, I had a copy of Abbe Hue's \"Journeys\", and \"The Mission of George Bogle to Thibet\" and \"The Journey of Thomas Manning to Lhassa\", published in London in 1879. On showing these books to Dr. Hen- sold t he took possession of them during his visit, and I could not resist the suspicion that he was writing further 'Travels in the far East\". I secured him a fine audience for his public lecture which seemed quite common- place in view of his wonderful per- sonal experiences, and the oft repeated statement in The Arena that none of these things was covered by the pledge of secrecy. Hospitality, however, made me conceal my disappointment. Following his public lecture he was in- vited by the \"Pharmaceutical Society\" to give them a lecture on \"The Adepts of India\" which he accepted. \"Now\", I thought, \"the oracle must speak\"."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"168 The Reality of Matter The audience was composed largely of practical scientists, chemists and professors from the University of Cincinnati.

When asked to explain myself after the lecture (which was commonplace to most of his audience) I could only throw up my hands and refer to The Arena articles. I met Mr. Hensoldt again in Cincinnati about seven or eight years ago, under peculiar circumstances, and at the time knew of the matters referred to by the author of these pages regarding \"educators in Columbia University and Syracuse\": but let these go as unimportant events in this \"ancient history\".

Recently, while In Chicago, I was shown a copy of these two articles on \"The Brotherhood of India\", by their author, reviewing the Incidents above recorded, and I urged very earnestly that they be placed accessible to present students. The sources from which Hensoldt de- rived the warp and woof of the Fairy Tales on which he embroidered the figure of his hero, Coomra Sami, are not at all difficult to determine.

Thrown upon his own resources to uphold the \"illusions of matter\", he had recourse to Descartes. With extension and motion, and Cogito as his starting point, he made his \"Plea for Pantheism\", and to any student of the real philosophy of Old India, revealed his utter ignorance. While naming Leibnitz, Spinoza and Des- cartes, he had digested none of their phil- osophies, while the Parabrahm, Mulapra- krita, Fohat and Akasu of the ancient Brahmins seemed entirely unknown to him.
