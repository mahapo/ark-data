The specific design and purpose of the preced- ing Booklet (No. 6) on the subject of \"Curaiwe Faith \", was to make clear to my readers the fact that Faith, as a curative agent, has a distinctly scientific aspect which is not generally under- stood by those who most earnestly and sincerely claim to exemplify the teachings of the Master, Jesus, in their work of \"healing the sick\".

It only remains to be said that this state and condition of normality means nothing more nor less than Physical Health, or \" Wholeness\" — expressed by the Master, Jesus. While it is not intended to contain a complete exposition of the curative process and power of Faith, nevertheless, I am permitting myself to hope that its readers will find that little booklet of some real and practical value. I hope it may open to them r or to some of them at least, a bet- ter understanding' of how to establish within themselves the realization of that marvelous Faith that makes men \"whole\".

It is this broader view of Tlic subject 1 have reserved for the subject mat- ter of this booklet. In its religious aspects Faith has exercised a broader, deeper and more powerful influence, during the Christian era, than the world in gen- eral has realized. It is today, as it has been since the religion of Jesus Christ had its birth, the background and main support of all that is in- eluded in ''The Christian Religion\", regardless of its denominational variations. Clustering about the life and teachings of the Master, Jesus, there have been some two hundred, perhaps more, dogmatic religions that have come into existence, comprising many millions of ad- herents, each one of whom has believed himself or herself to be a \"Christian\". Cnderlying all these denominational Christian movements the dogma of \"Salvation through"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"12 IHarmonic Setf-^nfoldment Faith\" lias been the substantial foundation upon which they have rested. Jesus died upon the cross. He suffered the shedding of his own blood as a ** propitiation for the sins of the world\". He died that those who believed in him might have eternal life. The doctrine of \"Salvation through Faith in Jesus Christ\" has been the cor- nerstone of the Christian religion from the earli- est history of the church. At one time the entire Christian civilization was shaken to its foundation by a profound doc- trinal discussion as to the possibility of \"Salva- tion by Faith alone\". There were many learned disputants who held that the words of the Master himself established the full power and sufficiency of Faith alone when he said: \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son. that whosoever believeth in him should not per- ish, but have everlasting life.\" But there have been many also who have based"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(Jfaith and liDorks 13 their conviction upon the teachings of James, who .says: 2. 14 — •\"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works f Can faith save him? 2. 17; Even so faith, if il hath not works, is dead, being alone. 2, 24; Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith alone.\" While this disputed point left its mark upon the sou's of men. and led to many divisions in the Christian churches, it seems to have estab- lished the point upon which all agree, namely, that Faith is essential to those who seek salvation and eternal life. Hut there is something vastly more worthy of our consideration, as to the value and efficacy of Faith in the great scheme of individual life, and the relation of individual life to the divine Cre- ator of all life.

But why? And what is the profound inconsist- ency to which you refer? Listen : In many ways we all express our faith in the existence of God — in the sense of a Great Creative Intelligence; faith in the Law of Com- pensation; faith in the curative potency of Nature's elements: faith in a spiritual life; faith in the continuity of individual life: faith in the power and virtue of prayer ; faith in our ability to overcome the power of evil ; faith that physical death is but an incident in Life; faith that all things in Nature are governed by immutable Law; faith that under and by virtue of the fixed and immutable nature of creation, the planets"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"rjaith and Hdorks 15 will continue to revolve iu their individual orbits. without accident or destructive possibilities; faith that we, as individualized, intelligent beings, ex- press the highest and must exalted evidence of an Omniscient Creator's handiwork: And yet — and yet — many of us have little or no faith in the one great reality of the universe, namely, that all things work together for GOOD; that the ulti- mate design of th> Great Creative Intelligence is beneficent; that the j>rin<iples upon which Hod Ikis fashioned his universe are righteous; that we hurt absoluti ly no ground for doubt or fear as to the final outcome of Nature's beneficent designs; that it is not within the range of possibilities for an omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent Cre- ative Intelligence to fail in tJie accomplishment oj its purposes: that the purpose and designs of such a Creative Intelligence must inevitably be for the best good of all created things; hence, that our Faith in the const notice destiny of tin"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"16 ^Harmonic $elf- c Unfoldment human Sou! is founded upon flic Rock of Eternal TRUTH.

A definite illustration.

When I arrived at his home I found two physi- cians in consultation, and his wife and her sister were overwhelmed with grief. They all believed that he could not possibly live more than a few hours, at the outside. The physicians informed me that there was not the least possible hope of his recovery — and that his death was impending, and might occur at any moment. When I entered his room, stood leaning over him and looked into his eyes, I knew — with the conviction of absolute Faith — that I could bring him back to life and health.

I waited a moment, and then said: \"Jo, you have called me to you because you want to tell me something — something that you have concealed from the whole world — something that will ex- plain to me why you are afraid to die — and then you want to ask me a number of questions con- cerning what you must face when you pass from this physical body, alone, out into the spiritual world.\" The expression of fear came back into his face, for a moment, and he whispered — as if suddenly too weak to speak aloud: \"Then you know — and I have only deceived"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"<3aith and IfDorks 21 myself into the belief that my secret has been mine alone, during all these years!\" I replied: \"Rut, Jo, I am the only one who knows, and I shall never betray you.

Hence it is that the individual who comes to the door of the Greal School and knocks for ad- mittance as a Student, should be made to under- stand and realize that he \" who enters here leaves doubt, fear, pessimism, cowardice, evil anticipa- tions and despair behind\".

This can never be achieved nor attained while his Soul harbors doubts, or fears, or destructive anticipations as to the ultimate destiny of man as an individualized, intelligent Entity, or as to the fact that his interests are in the care and under the direction of a Creative Intelligence whose purposes are beneficent and whose power is unlimited.

This means that the goal of individual life, toward which we all are moving — whether we know it or not, whether we so desire or not, whether we believe it or not — is constructive, hence, good, righteous, just, and consistent with the highest and most exalted idealism of the human Soul. It means that there is no ideal or concept of the human heart, the numan intelli- gence, or the human Soul, sufficiently beautiful, sufficiently perfect, sufficiently exalted, or suffi- ciently satisfying to reflect more than a mere shadow of the infinite beauty, beneficenee and perfection of the goal fixed for us by the Great Creative Intelligence as the summum bonum of individual Destiny."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"54 harmonic Qelf-^nfoldment When the student has taken these two vital and essentia! steps in preparation for the definite Work ahead of him, he has laid the substantial foundation upon which to build the exalted super- structure of the Temple of his individual Char- acter.

Is there anything in such a prospect that should impel one to look upon it witli fear, dread, repug- nance or horror? On the other hand, every indi- vidual who has arrived at a clear understanding of the problem of individual life, should carry securely within his inmost consciousness a real- ization of the fact — for it is a fact — that when- ever, and wherever, and however the \"Angel of Death'' shall come to him in the natural course of events — and icithout his own connivana or"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"36 ZFCarmoncc £eLf- r: Ur\\foCdment invitation — it will come as a cherished friend and not as a fearful and hateful enemy.

All of which is promptly conceded — when the subject is considered without reference to its sci- entific analysis.

The first, third and fifth of the musical scale, sounded at the same time, produce a most pleas- ing effect upon the ear. called harmony. This produces a musical chord. But, suppose you strike 1. 2 and 3 of the scab simultaneously. The result is a most excruciat- ing discord. It is painful. It actually hurts, as if one has been hit in tbe very center of his musi- cal consciousness with a piercing, three pronged fork that not only has the effect of piercing, but of actually tearing, or raking the musical sensi- bilities of the Hoid. until one is strongly impelled to cry out with the pain of it."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"^4 Saving c>fc#ise of THumor 55 Now strike 1.

Rhythm is the element of music which has to do with the movement of a musical composition, its division into \"measures\", and its natural oca nts upon certain counts of each measure. Now. in most, if not all. musical compositions, there is a melody, or air, which is often called the '\"tune\". The accompaniment to this melody is an ar- rangement of harmony which sustains the mel- ody and greatly adds to its sweetness and beauty.

Tt is in this progressive adjustment of harmony that a discord often becomes absolutely necessary to enable you to get from one harmony to an* other. In other words, often the only way of getting from one harmony to another is by throw- ing in a discord between the two harmonies. The discord, in this ease, becomes merely a \"stepping- stone\", as it were, by which to make the forward move.

This answers your assumed question: \"Are there 'constructive inharmonies' in Nature ?\" In the purely limited sense referred to. there are.

They are made into a constructive environment for the physical body, from which its devastating thirst for the Waters of Life is quenched and satisfied.

Let us now return to a further consideration of the rejuvenating process of humor, mirth and fun.

Hence, we must not condemn him for his egoistic attitude of soul. It is an effort for him to consider the interests or the happiness of others while he is yet in the midst of the search for his own personal happi- ness.

It is right that every individual should know that the shortest and most direct road to the goal of his own Self-Completion (as well as to Individual Completion and Perfect Happi- ness) runs through the sunlit valley of unselfish- ness, beside the still waters of altruistic service.

The specific truth I desire to impress upon my readers isi this : 1. While it is true that Altruism becomes the natural occupation of those who have achieved Self-Completion and Nature's reward therefor (Individual Completion', this Ead must not be taken to mean that the individual is free from altruistic obligations and duties befort he reaches that consummation. 2.

He desires to meet his obligations and discharge his responsibilities. This gives him occupation for all his time and personal efforts. He needs, or thinks he needs, more money. He takes a course in \"Psycho- Analysis\", or \"Prac- tical Psychology'', for the purpose of learning how he can command the financial aid he seems to require to meet his ideas and purposes.

During all his researches, he seemed to be im- bued with the supreme desire to become a Master of the Law that he might devote himself to the cause of humanity. His one thought and pur- pose seemed to bd to become a ' ' Servant of Humanity\". But. because of his devotion to the search for Truth, he had neglected to provide for his own material needs.

Those individuals who respond most readily and receive most distinctly such mental and psy- chical messages are those whose attention is not fixed, at the time, upon definite matters so in- tensely as to prevent them from receiving the conscious impulse of the message.

The individual who seeks to use his friends for his own personal advantage, benefit and gain and who loses interest in them when he can selfishly use them no longer, is invoking the destructive principle of nature in his own life. If he but knew it, he is thereby erecting barriers in the pathway of his own success. He cannot make friends unless he is himself a true and loyal friend.

Its members have toiled for the advancement of the human race from ignorance to knowledge, from darkness to light, throughout the ages past.
