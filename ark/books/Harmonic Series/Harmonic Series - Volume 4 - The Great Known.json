Vol. Ill HARMONIC SERIES This book carries a hope, a message, a suggestion and a warning to all who are honestly, patiently and persistently seeking to prove that Death does not end all. It shows that there is a great difference between Belief and Real Knowledge, and proves that mere beliefs are not of any value to the one who would prove that there is a life beyond the grave. He must Know and Do, and this book points the way. It is unique in that its statements are verified facts which every reader may prove for himself under right guidance, if he but have the \"Intelli- gence to know, the Courage to dare, and the Per- severance to do.\" The philosophy taught in this book appeals to both Reason and Conscience, and is an inspiration to \"Live the Life and Know the Law.\" The science and philosophy it presents agree in all essentials with the demonstrated facts of mod- ern physicial science, but go beyond them into the realm of the Spiritual World. There it presents an entirely new field of personally demonstrated facts, which enlarges the scope of hitherto accepted science, and points the way to new discoveries. In this, as in any other science, the investigator is confronted with certain definite propositions and is given a working formula for their solution. In this, as in any other science, successful solution depends chiefly upon the individual ability, capac- ity and character of the student. $3.«)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T HE/- pREAT NOWN"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Great Known Volume IV HARMONIC SERIES Revised Edition By J.

This means that the Spiritual World is as much a part of Nature as the physical world which is so familiar to us all. Hence the Spiritual World is not an UN- natural world.

It de- sires to co-operate with both these schools and bring them into a friendly attitude of tolerance and mutual endeavor in the greater interests of humanity. It realizes that each of these two schools of science has set for it- self certain arbitrary limitations which mark the boundaries of its legitimate field of in- quiry.

They are willing to concede that, so far as they are concerned, such a purely physical solution is impossible to one yet in the physical body. The Masters, during their study of the Great Problems, and their continued search for a definite method of solution, discovered the fact that, through a rigorous course of self-discipline and contemplation of a higher and finer life, they were able to develop a higher and a finer set of senses, through which they were able to come into conscious relation with a finer world of material than that of the purely physical. They designated these finer senses \"Spiritual Senses,\" to dis- tinguish them from the ''physical senses.\" The world into which they were able to penetrate consciously through these finer senses, they called a ''spiritual world.\" Thus began the scientific solution of the great problem of another life in a finer world of matter.

Through their continued accumulation and expansion of their knowledge through per- sonal experience, they finally made the great discovery that there is a Moral Order of Nature; and that it is directly related to the method and process by which an individual may develop his own Spiritual senses and discover the spiritual world for himself. If he keeps faith with Nature, and lives his life in harmony with her Constructive Principle, her reward is inevitable, which is his Spiritual Unfoldment and Soul Growth. 18"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"FACTS OF NATURE If he fails to keep faith with Nature, and refuses to live his life in harmony with the Moral Law, he reverses the process of spir- itual unfoldment and bars the way to his own Mastership. He will thus never be able to make the scientific demonstration of the Great Problem this side the grave. The methods of the Great School of Nat- ural Science adapt themselves to the normal development of the individual human being in such manner as to enable him to retain full and complete control of all of his sense channels, both physical and spiritual, throughout his entire physical life, however long he may live. And, if he has lost con- trol of his spiritual senses during child- hood — as many do — it enables him to regain them without harm of any kind to himself or to others. A part of the Work of The Great School of Natural Science, at this time, is to give to the world the benefits of such scientific knowledge as it has accumulated bearing upon these subjects, and open the way for the co-operation of physical science and spir- itual science in the work of liberating hu- 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN manity from the bondage of Ignorance, Superstition and Fear.

It should, to say the least, be regarded as unscientific. All physical matter, both inorganic and organic, integrates conjointly with a finer ethereal or spiritual pattern, in such manner as to constitute what may properly be termed a double material entity. No attempt will be made here to account for this phenomenon of Nature. It simply exists as one of the established facts with which Natural Science is compelled to deal. As such it forms an important link in the chain which connects the two correlated worlds of matter, motion, number, life and intelligence. In the kingdom of inorganic matter these two bodies appear to be more equally de- 35"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN pendent, one upon the other, than are the duplicate bodies of organic matter. This is more fully explained by the facts which follow. The integration of a physical stone con- jointly with its finer ethereal pattern is of such a character that upon the sudden and forced disintegration and dissolution of the physical stone its finer ethereal body, or du- plicate, remains intact for a comparatively brief period of time. In due course of time, however, the ether- eal body of the stone also disintegrates, dis- solves, and to every appearance returns to its original elements. During the time it remains intact this ethereal body of the stone is visible with per- fect distinctness to one whose sense of sight is keen enough to observe it. In the vegetable kingdom the two material bodies do not manifest the same degree of mutual dependence, one upon the other, as in the mineral kingdom. Upon the sudden disintegration and dis- solution of the physical body of an oak tree its ethereal duplicate persists intact for a 26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"FACTS DEMONSTRATED much longer period than does the ethereal body of the stone. But in due course of time the ethereal tree also disintegrates, dissolves, disappears from the magnetic plane of the vegetable kingdom, and to every appearance is resolved back into its original elements. In the animal kingdom the independence of the spiritual body from the physical, in its power of continuity, is very markedly increased. At the period of physical dissolution of an animal it is clear (to one v^ho is able to ob- serve the transition) that the spiritual body carries with it (or accompanies) the animat- ing principle of the animal entity. This is evidenced by the fact that during its exist- ence as a spiritual organism it appears to possess all the natural faculties and intelli- gent capacities and powers which belong to the animal entity. The animal, however, in due course of time, disappears from the spiritual plane of the animal kingdom.

In the kingdom of man the transition we call physical death is even more clearly a mere incident in the life of the soul. At the moment of physical dissolution of a man, woman or child, the spiritual body separates from the physical in a manner which appears to be identical with the sepa- ration of the two bodies of the animal at its physical death. The animating principle of the double or- ganic entity accompanies (or is accom- panied by) the spiritual organism only, when physical death occurs, and in this re- spect the process of dissolution corresponds, in all appearance, with that of the animal. The spiritual man, woman or child per- sists intact upon the spiritual planes of life for an indefinite period of time after physical dissolution, as does the animal (with the ex- ceptions hereinafter noted).

In other words, man disappears from the lowest plane of his spiritual life in either of two different manners and by two distinctly opposite methods or processes. That is to say, under the constructive prin- ciple and process of evolution, growth, de- velopment and progress, he disappears from the lowest plane of spiritual life, only to appear upon the next higher, inhabiting a finer spiritual organism, clothed in richer splendor, and in possession of all the nat- ural faculties and intelligent capacities and powers with which he was invested at the time of the transition, and with the same in- dividuality.

But under the operation of the opposite principle and process of destruction, or devo- lution, man also disappears from the lowest plane of his spiritual life in a manner which corresponds, in every essential particular, with the disappearance of the animal. In this latter instance he does not reappear (at least in identical or distinguishable form) upon any of the higher planes of spir- itual life which are distinctively related to this particular planet. In the spiritual life man's ability to persist and advance from lower to higher planes of existence is commensurate with his own in- dependent control of all his individual fac- ulties, capacities and powers, and in response to his independent, self-conscious and ra- tional volition and desire to so persist and advance.

But in the spiritual life, as in the physical, man may fail, neglect or refuse to make the effort necessary to obtain or exercise control of his individual faculties, capacities and powers. Or, once having acquired such con- trol, he may deliberately surrender it to other intelligences, provided he can find those who are willing to assume the responsibility. Or he may knowingly and intentionally prosti- tute his powers to dishonest and vicious purposes. In every such instance he is proceeding in conformity with Nature's Destructive Prin- ciple, and must pay the penalty which Na- ture exacts therefor. The inevitable result is retrogression, involving a corresponding for- feiture of the power of self-control.

It will be understood that the physical body is but a coarser duplicate of the spir- itual, and that each and every physical organ has its spiritual duplicate. There is a spir- itual brain as well as a physical brain. There is a spiritual organ of sight as well as a phys- ical one.

It has demonstrated that the five physical senses are not fine enough to sense the exist- ence of the finer world of Spiritual Matter and Spiritual Things. It has demonstrated that the five spiritual senses are too fine to sense the existence of the coarser world of Physical Matter and Phys- ical Things.

By the exercise of that same Will Power it can open the physical and spiritual channels of sense simultaneously, and thus sense both worlds — physical and spiritual — at the same time. It has learned that every normal human infant is born into this physical life with all its channels of sense, both physical and spir- itual, awake and active. It has also proven that, under normal conditions, the individual may even grow to manhood, or womanhood, or even to old age, without losing the Power of Will to control all its sense channels, both physical and spiritual. At the same time, it has learned that a very large percentage of human individuals lose conscious and volun- tary control of their spiritual senses and powers during childhood; that some of them regain control of them in their later physical 34"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"FACTS DEMONSTRATED life, and that many never regain them during their entire physical life. But man in the physical body is generally so conditioned that his intelligence operates far more consciously through the physical organism than it does through the spiritual. This is one of the provisions of nature with which science must deal in its solution of the question here under consideration. It is also a fact that wherever this condi- tion obtains the individual is concerned with and absorbed in the impressions which reach his consciousness from the physical world only. The action of the spiritual organism, however, is not entirely suspended, as might be inferred. It is merely obscured or cov- ered up, as it were, by that condition of na- ture which fixes the attention upon the phys- ical plane.

Carrying the illustration still further, it is an interesting fact that a worker in the steel factory, in course of time, trains his sense of hearing to distinguish the sound of the human voice even in the midst of the din and blast of the factory which at first made such a thing impossible. The question nat- urally arises as to how he acquires this re- markable power. The answer is simple. It is necessary for him to communicate with his fellow workmen in some manner. The only adequate means of communication with which he is familiar is the sound of the human voice. In the midst of the noise of the factory, therefore, he must still depend upon his sense of hearing and upon its ability to distinguish the sound of a human voice.

In course of time and constant training his power of perception is intensified until the human voice once more distinctly registers its impressions, and to his trained conscious- ness stands out fully distinguishable from the general turmoil of his environment. He has simply developed his power of attention to the thing desired until his consciousness re- sponds to the new demands thus made upon it.

He does not feel the necessity for employing other means or using other channels of communi- cation. In most instances he does not even know that they exist. And so long as there is no absolute necessity for the development of the finer senses he continues to be absorbed with those more familiar to him. Just so long as his attention is thus confined to a plane of existence entirely below that of the spiritual his consciousness distinguishes noth- ing higher than the plane of his attention.

The only index by which these varying strata may be distinguished, by one who has passed through them, is by the phenomenon of color. The reason the individual is not able to distinguish these varying colors while he is passing through them is, that he is with- out the means of contrasting them with each other. This ability, however, he acquires as he passes upward through any given plane.

And in the possession of this added knowledge and power, one can understand that it is, in es- sence, no more difficult for him to return from the surface of the thirteenth plane than it is for him to descend from the surface of the tenth, when he had only evolved to that plane and condition of life and had acquired the knowledge and added power which go with that degree of evolution.

Whatever he may desire to accomplish for the benefit of those in the plane or planes below him, is normally accomplished by the aid and co- operation of those in the planes below him. That is to say, if one in the thirteenth plane desired to accomplish a definite work for the inhabitants of the earth plane, he would em- ploy the services and the aid of the inhabitants of the next lower plane (the twelfth), who would hand it down to the next, and so on, until when it had reached the first spiritual plane there would be those upon that plane fully equipped and ready to do the thing de- sired. This is the general method employed in such events.

In other words, every indi- vidual on the spiritual side of life must be able to manifest himself and his presence upon each and all of the spiritual planes be- low him. This is one of his important duties. It is by the right use of his knowledge that he is able to clothe himself in the material condi- tions of any of the lower spiritual planes. The various \"planes\" represent the differ- ent states and conditions of materiality through which the individual Soul must pass on its way to its individual goal — whatever and wherever that may be.

The material body, as it evolves upon the spiritual planes of life, becomes a dynamo of ever-increasing power and light. The Great Friends who are far above and beyond us in their evolutionary unfoldment, come from their several abodes in the higher realms of spiritual life and clothe themselves in the material conditions of all the interven- ing planes of life between them and the first spiritual. The light which radiates from them is so intense, and the power of its active radia- tion so irresistible, that the spiritual eyes of a physical individual would be blinded for a time, at least, until they would be able to ad- just themselves to the dynamic force and condition of their presence and environment. 86"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL LIGHT AND COLOR Since this condition obtains, one can readily understand and appreciate to what added de- gree of intensity and dynamic power it would obtain in the case of psychics who have been developed through the subjective process of mediumship.

In other words, each spiritual plane reflects some of its intensity, in the form of light, upon each and all of the planes that lie below it.

These artistic representations have educated the majority of mankind, upon the physical plane, into the idea and the conviction that wherever the Master goes he walks in the midst of a \"Great Light.\" This, in turn, has been followed by the idea that, if He should ever appear to anyone upon the earth plane, it would be in the midst of a great, miraculous illumination. And it is but one more step for them to assume that this luminosity of pres- ence is the special and exclusive sign, index, or badge of the Master Jesus.

As we come to the full maturity of our intelligence and wisdom, we come to know more and more definitely just what Mother Nature has in store for us at every step of the way.

It would seem that Na- ture has stored up in these wonderful fruits and vegetables every possible shade of enjoy- able appeal to the senses of taste and smell. The spiritual people eat these fruits and vegetables, not because that process is really necessary to their bodily life — as it is here — but because they derive from their juices and essences, the most intense sensuous enjoyment.

He frankly admitted that he was profoundly disturbed lest he might find, upon arriving in spiritual life, that his reli- gious views and doctrines were all wrong.

In other words, it enters the life of the spiritual at exactly the point where it leaves off the life of earth. It is in nowise changed in its essential nature. In truth, it is just a human being who has moved into a new neighborhood and a new environment. A man who is a \"devil\" in physical form will continue to be a \"devil\" in spiritual form — until he has learned the great lesson that it Joes not pay to be a \"devil\" upon any plane of life. If he has been a good man on earth he will continue a good man after he arrives in the spiritual life, because he will soon learn that goodness is the only thing that really pays — in any life. If he has found his place in music upon the earth plane, he will continue to find it in music upon the spiritual plane.

If his ambition upon earth has been to become a great artist, the same ambition will govern him in the spiritual life, and he will try just as hard there to gratify that ambition as he did here. His own natural desire and preference determine the individual's occupation in the spiritual life. For instance: If his natural desire and preference are to become a great spiritual musician, he is first instructed in what are the duties and responsibilities of a \"Great Musician\" in the world of spiritual liie. He is made to know just what are the opportunities which that profession opens to the individual to serve his fellows. He is schooled until he knows the Motives that must govern the musician in the service he is to render. Those of the spiritual life have musi- cal instruments and organizations which transcend beyond all comparison, anything we have upon the earth plane. In some of their great symphony orchestras there are many thousands of players, using hundreds of different kinds of musical instruments un- 127"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN like anything we have in our greatest earthly orchestras. They also have vocal associations containing hundreds of thousands of the greatest vocal artists. To hear one of their grand operas or concerts is a musical treat to those who hear it beyond anything that we of earth are permitted to enjoy. It is in such instances as these that those of the spiritual life employ their records for the benefit of the masses and the public. These records can be transmitted and reproduced in such manner that many millions of their people may thus enjoy their benefits. At this point arises a suggestion which should be of especial interest to artists of all kinds upon the earth plane, including musi- cians, painters, artistic designers, and so on. It is this: We upon the earth plane have a musical scale of only seven distinct tones. But running between these seven tones of our musical scale are infinite shades of tone which are not expressed by any of our arbitrary in- struments upon the earth plane. Even the hu- man voice and such instruments as the violin and the cello conform themselves to the strict seven-tone skeleton, or conventional scale, in i2i"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL OCCUPATION all forms of musical expression excepting what we term the \"slur.\" In this expression, the voice slides from one tone to another and in its course touches all the intermediate tones possible. But in the spiritual life their musical in- struments, as well as their methods of vocal- ization, are constructed upon an infinite scale, instead of a scale limited to seven tones. Thus they are able to express every conceivable shade of musical tone the Soul is able to conceive. The work of artists, therefore, becomes infinitely more complex but at the same time infinitely more perfect and beautiful. When compared with the musical instruments of the spiritual planes our physical instruments appear clumsy and imperfect, as well as inadequate. The spiritual painter makes use of every con- ceivable shade of color running between the recognized primary colors of the physical universe. They give expression to sense ex- perience which is unknown upon the physical plane. Our physical painters, in their en- deavors to \"mix\" colors, are able to obtain certain intermediate colors which only serve 129"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN to suggest the infinite possibilities of art upon the spiritual planes, where every conceivable shade of every color is utilized in bringing out the finer effects of their artistic ideals. This differentiation in the power of ex- pression is observable in every department of artistic lines of endeavor upon the spiritual planes. The intensified refinement of spir- itual material adapts itself to the unfoldment of the higher and finer designs of the Soul in every department of Nature. After the individual has been educated sufficiently in the basic principles of spiritual life to have a clear understanding and ap- preciation of just what is involved in any particular occupation, he is informed in the same way concerning other lines of en- deavor; and, when he is able to do so intelli- gently, he is permitted to select his vocation and proceed to qualify in it, with every fa- cility to that end. If he should learn, how- ever, that some other department of endeavor will afford him greater opportunity for Service, he may abandon his \"Chosen Ca- reer\" — as one may in this life — and substitute some other vocation.

After all, he is left free to determine the field and the lines of his occupation there, as here. And this is entirely consistent with the Law of Life which makes each individual the sole arbiter of his own destiny. If this were not true, what would become of the Law of Personal Responsibility and Moral Accountability? Remember that Nature is Consistent. There are special times and conditions when and wherein an individual in the spir- itual body may be of special service to one or more in the physical life — provided he knows definitely the conditions existing. Under other conditions, however, he may be of far greater service to his fellows of spir- itual life, because of the fact that they are upon the same plane of life with him, and the facilities at his command for service are better adapted to his uses and needs.

There is not a scientist or inventor upon the earth plane of life but has a strong spir- itual support consisting of a group of spir- itual intelligences who are interested in the particular lines of their scientific discov- eries and inventions. These form themselves into a strong force, surround the physical scientist or inventor, make a spiritual environ- ment of strong magnetic conditions which are most favorable for clear and concentrated thinking on the part of the earthly scientist or inventor. At the same time, they estab- lish conditions which enable them to carry on a method of mental suggestion, so delicate and so unobtrusive as not to disturb the sci- entist or inventor, nor suggest to him that he is being influenced or helped by spiritual intelligences. Thus, the spiritual intelligences are able to 132"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL OCCUPATION make an environment for each and ever^' physical scientist or inventor, in which he is not only able to do his own best indepen- dent thinking and mental work, but in which they may also drop a mental suggestion now and then, which will set him thinking along new channels, and often in the very line which enables him to make a new discovery of great value. Doubtless there are many instances where spiritual intelligences exercise hypnotic con- trol over inventors upon the earth plane. All such cases result in great harm to the indi- vidual under hypnotic control. It is possible to make spiritual conditions which will constitute a wonderful environ- ment and atmosphere in which a physically embodied man or woman may be able to work out results which otherwise would be virtually impossible, and do it without in the least exercising control of any kind or de- gree over the mind or powers of the indi- vidual.

It is even possible, as in the instances I have already mentioned, for spiritual scien- tists and helpers to make conditions through which independent telepathic suggestions may be transmitted from them to the phys- ically embodied cooperator, v^ithout in the smallest degree invoking the destructive power of subjective psychic control. To understand this it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that any sort of mental as- sociation which leaves each mind free and independent to act according to its own ra- tional volition, does not involve subjection or control to any extent or in any form. When you and your neighbor meet upon the street and hail each other, or stop and pass the time of day, or discuss the weather, or the news of the day, or even engage in political contro- versy, there is no subjective psychic control of either over the other.

But, as soon as the spiritual individual learns the forceful language of impulse, these various forms of speech are of no special advantage to the individual. This is because, no matter what language an indi- vidual may employ upon the spiritual planes in which to clothe his thought, the thought itself, is the thing which is transmitted, and not the words in which it is clothed. Thought is a force; or, at least, it involves the exercise of a force. This means that 137"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN each and every thought the mind formulates, sets in motion the etheric substance of the universe. This thought-force, v^rhen not definitely directed by the thinker, radiates in all direc- tions from the center of thought, just as do the etheric and atmospheric waves radiate in all directions from one of our modern radio stations. But the direction of their travel is absolutely within the control of the thinker, so that he may direct them into definite cur- rents, as he wills. When I call the Master, I fix him definitely in my own mind. That act alone, on my part, establishes a fixed and definite line of sympathy (or communica- tion) between my mind and his. This cre- ates the definite channel (or wire) over and upon which my thought then travels directly to him along that fixed and definite line. The nearest approach to this process which we have on our side of life is in our use of wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony. This is but a much coarser physical means of transmitting thought than the one I use to call the Master. By the wireless telephone, the sound of 138"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION the voice travels upon the etheric waves of the earth plane.

Thought is not only a mere force; it is a force that is set in motion by the Soul of the thinker. The Soul impulse — or psychic force — carries through all the planes of matter, and can be caught and understood by all who are sensitive enough to respond to it. The physical words, which are but a crude cloth- ing of the soul impulse, carry solely upon the physical plane — and often but a very short distance even there. They can be heard only by those who are equipped with a physical ear and a physical brain; for these are the physical instruments for the transmission and the reception of purely physical sounds from one individual to another on the earth plane. Thought is simply an impulse, propelled 139"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN from the individual mind through the power of his own Will and, when it reaches the thought receiver of another Soul, that other Soul registers the exact impulse of the mind, or Soul, of the sender.

It is something more than what we generally term \"Thought Transference\" or \"Mental Telepathy,\" as we know of these methods upon the earth plane at the present time. The important distinc- tion lies in this: In the process of mental telepathy, as we employ it upon the earth plane, the sender endeavors to transmit some definite statement expressed mentally or otherwise in definite words. This is not always true, but it is the more frequent method employed. In the Language of Impulse, however, there is no effort to transmit any message expressed in words. On the other hand, it consists of an impulse of the Soul which the sender desires to transmit to another individ- ual Soul. It may be, and often is, but a very definite desire or a very definite sense experi- ence. The sender realizes in himself the ex- 140"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION act impulse that would express the meaning he desires to transmit. Then by the power of his Will, fixed upon the receiver, he gives the propelling power which transmits that impulse as a definite experience. The re- ceiver gets it, not as a spoken message, but as an exact experience which is being realized in the Soul of the sender at the time. Every thought expressed in physical words is an impulse of the Soul and, as such, is also expressed at the same time, and by the same impulse, in spiritual words. You will bet- ter understand just what this means, if you will bear in mind the scientific fact that the impulse of speech is an impulse of the Soul. It expresses itself through both the physical channels and the spiritual at the same time — provided both sense channels are open and active. This is equally true of those upon the physical plane, even as they go about their daily tasks and occupations. It is for this reason that those upon the spiritual plane can hear what we, upon the physical side, say to each other when we converse without any thought or intention of conveying our 141"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN thoughts to any but those upon the physical plane with whom we are directly talking. Even though we are conscious of using only our physical organs of speech, those upon the spiritual plane who desire to do so can get our thoughts which are conveyed to them through their spiritual channels of communi- cation entirely. The Soul, which is back of both our material bodies, and expresses itself through them, sends its impulse of speech through the sense channels of both bodies. Therefore, when both channels of sense are open and clear, each receives and registers every Soul impulse at the same time. Those upon the spiritual side who hear us get the spiritual impulse only — but it is just as clear and distinct to them as it is to the individual who hears it upon the physical plane with his physical ears only. The power of thought is so potent and so refined in its action that a physically em- bodied Soul, through the channels of its spir- itual body, may transmit its thoughts, its de- sires and its purposes to those upon the spir- itual plane with definite certainty.

The individual, however, who know- ingly and intentionally makes a definite effort to communicate with one upon the spiritual plane, and transmit a message of love or of sympathy and helpfulness, accomplishes his purpose with a definite certainty far beyond his powers to transmit thought upon the earth plane. He does this by first fixing his attention upon the individual to whom he desires to send his message. The instant his attention is so fixed in loving attitude, the magnetic bond of communication is definitely established be- tween those two specific individuals.

This, however, does not mean that there are no other methods of communication on the spiritual planes of life. Indeed, they can employ any one, or all, of the channels of sense for the purpose of communicating their definite thoughts from one to another. But aside from the Language of Impulse, the channel of sound is the one most frequently employed. By this is meant the spoken words; for, spiritual intelligences are able to express their thoughts in any language of words with which they are familiar, as well as we upon the earth can do. And, for al- most all purely social purposes, this is the method employed. Those of the spiritual life also have vari- ous methods of transmitting their thoughts in written form. These methods are employed where it may be important to refer promptly to an exact record of what has been said con- cerning some definite subject by some par- ticular individual. Those of the spiritual life not only keep certain written records for reference, but they employ a more perfect 144"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL COMMUNICATION record which is clearly analogous to our physical phonograph. By this method they are able to make a record which, when re- produced, gives back an exact expression in vocal words, with every shade of vocal em- phasis and inflection of the voice so recorded.

This method is employed whenever and wherever it is in- tended or desired that the records shall be reproduced in the presence and for the bene- fit of a number of individuals at a distance. It is employed when any of the Great Spir- itual Friends are speaking for the benefit of the general public, or for the benefit of the students in the various spiritual institutions of learning. The record of a public address may thus be duplicated and sent wherever desired and there reproduced in the presence of all those who desire to hear the address.

This fact is here explained in or- der that the reader may understand what oc- curs upon the spiritual planes when a speaker is delivering to an immense audience a mes- sage in the language of impulse.

But there is one essential particular in which the analogy does not hold — as yet. This is in the fact that the earth plane of life has no centralized, general government for the entire physical plane.

The ablest scientists of the spiritual world were at work constantly, endeavoring to as- sist our earthly scientists and inventors in the discovery of new and improved methods of warfare.

Those who desired the Germans to win gathered their spiritual forces into great armies, and entered into the magnetic field, where they could approach as closely as possible to the German armies upon earth. They went with the Germans and their allies into every battle, accompanied their forces in every charge, exerted all their powers to make their presence known to their earthly comrades, cheered them as far as they could do so, through psychic means, sustained their courage, took away from them all dread of physical death, added the strength of their 160"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"SPIRITUAL WARS magnetic force to every blow that was struck by their earthly allies, and did everything in their power to help win the war for the side they had espoused.

But this was not a hand-to-hand struggle of the spiritual forces with each other, nor with the purpose or intent of \"killing\" each other; for this would have been impossible. Nevertheless, it was possible for one of the spiritual armies to exercise its powers against the other in such manner as to destroy its support of the physical armies of its choice.

These apparent \"miracles\" were due en- tirely to the fact that the spiritual forces opposing the Germans were able, at those points, to center their spiritual magnetic forces upon the physical magnetic conditions of the earth and reverse the currents which carried the poisonous gases. In many other instances the spiritual forces were so numerous and the magnetic condi- tions they made were so strong and intense, that there must have been a semi-materiali- zation of the spiritual armies upon the earth plane.

This does not mean that they question the integrity or good faith of any writer who has had the rare courage to give to the world such information as has come within the range of his investigations. Neither does it mean that they are assuming any more exalted standard of morality for themselves than that which has actuated our best writers. It means only that their point of observation has been such that they could view the activities upon both planes of life at the same time and could, perhaps, differentiate more clearly and accu- rately between them.

This vast spiritual throng also is generating and giving off into the common environment, a constant flood of spiritual magnetism which mingles with the physical magnetism of the physically embodied hosts. The quality of this magnetic energy, in every instance, is governed very largely by the grade and quality of the emotions and passions of the men constituting these two co- ordinating throngs of men so brought to- gether into sympathetic association.

At the physical death of an Indian brave, his friends and fellow warriors upon the physical side kill his favorite horse and, in some instances, bury the bodies of the two together. This custom grows out of the fact that the Indians, through their psychics, come to know that both animals and men persist after physical death. They also know that the Indian finds his greatest pleasure in his horse. Assuming that he carries with him into the spiritual life the same desires, ambi- tions, loves and longings, they conclude that when he arrives upon the spiritual plane the one thing he will most keenly miss is the horse that has afforded him so much enjoyment on the physical plane of life.

Sometimes the fleeting physical im- pression of real dreams becomes confused in the consciousness with these purely spiritual experiences, and the sequence of spiritual experiences is lost. But in most of these experiences, where the spiritual channels of sense are registering vivid impressions, definite personalities im- press themselves upon the senses with suffi- cient vividness to carry the spiritual experi- ence to the threshold of physical sense per- ception, and the waking consciousness carries 189"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"THE GliEAT KNOWN the complete spiritual experience back to physical consciousness.

In such so-called \"dreams\" there is alvs^ays a definite and sequential chain of experiences which carry the unmistakable impression of actual experiences.

He gets no intimation or suggestion of just what it is, or what it is like; but nothing can erad- icate the fixed impression of the experience as a fact, and that it was of importance either to himself or to others. In such an experience one may see, with great distinctness, a group of people, men and women, sitting about a table, or moving among one another in a reception room, or listening to one who is addressing them from a rostrum.

He may have the distinct impression that this is an experi- ence he must remember after he is physically awake. He knows that it has some definite meaning for Him, and he determines to remember it all after he is physically awake. In many instances the very effort he makes to carry back the message or the vision or the experience to physical consciousness is the thing that closes the physical channels an in- stant before his consciousness is physically awake. In such instances he comes back to physical consciousness with the distinct real- ization that he was making an intense effort to remember, but that '^something slipped'* just at the wrong time, and the meaning of the experience is not brought back to phys- ical consciousness.

There are infinite variations upon these real spiritual experiences; but they generally differentiate themselves from the jumble of real dreams by the fact that there is some- thing in them that impresses one with the fact that there is a purpose back of them, and that he was on the verge of learning some lesson of great importance — // he only could carry it back to physical memory. Again, one awakes to physical conscious- ness with the definite and distinct impression that he has been out of his physical body and has traveled to some great distance and re- turned again.

He starts to leave it, turns and looks back at it, and indulges himself in rational speculations concerning it. Then he goes away, and is conscious of trav- eling, of sailing through space at great speed, of seeing many wonderful things; then he re- turns. He realizes with definite certainty, that he is coming back to his physical body. Finally, after moving on and on through seemingly endless space, he at last arrives at his starting point. Sure enough, there is his physical body, lying just as he left it. He watches it for a time. It lies there breathing as if it were sleeping naturally. He wonders if it is really necessary for him to enter it and take up the physical life again.

Then there comes the acquiescing impulse to get back. He wakens and knows that he is back again in the physical body.

One is able to carry them back into physical con- sciousness because, in that particular state of consciousness, the spiritual senses are wide open and functioning clearly and normally; and, at the same time, the physical channels of sense are partly open, and just sufficiently active to permit the spiritual experiences to carry over and consciously register upon the physical consciousness. In the course of the perfect development of the independent psychic, the time comes when the consciousness will register clearly upon both planes of life at the same time. This only means that the individual is fully awake both physically and spiritually at the same time. Both channels of sense are func- tioning normally. In this case the individual knows perfectly what is occurring upon both sides of life.

Or, the \"dream\" may be to the effect that someone whom we love devotedly is going to die at a certain time, and even in a certain definite manner. When the time comes the death occurs, and in the exact manner indicated. You may call them dreams if you like, but in just so far as the element of prophecy en- ters, the experience is not properly classified as a \"dream.\" So far as the individual him- self is concerned, it is a genuine \"prophecy\" or \"prophetic experience.\" 199"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN The prophetic element works itself out in the following manner: The condition or state of the Soul is that of partial sleep. The physical sense chan- nels are but partially closed. In truth, they are sufficiently open and active to carry over into wakeful consciousness the real experi- ences that have occurred spiritually. In the spiritual experience, some spiritual friend or associate who is able to see certain actual conditions as they exist, having a much clearer perception of the principle, or Law of Cause and Effect, perceives that, in the nature of things, a certain event is going to occur; and according to the speed with which events are moving, it should occur at a cer- tain time. This individual, by the language of impulse, conveys the suggestion to the semi-sleeper. It is done so subtly that the sleeper fails to realize that the suggestion comes to him from any other individual. He simply seems to realize that the event is go- ing to occur, and at a certain time, etc. To him, it is as if the cosmic universe has opened to him for an instant and this prophetic sug- gestion comes to him out of its deepest 200"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"PROPHECY depths.

For illustration: A railroad and a country automobile road both run upon the level of the ground over which they pass. They cross each other at a point where corn, at its full height, is grow- ing on both sides of both these roads. In these conditions neither the engineer of the railroad train nor the chauffeur of the auto- mobile approaching the crossing, can see the other. This is because they are both down on the level of the two roads, and the corn obstructs their view. But at a distance of a hundred yards from the crossing, in the midst of the corn, a great rock rises to the height of 200 feet above the level of the two roads. A man is standing on the top of it. Neither the engineer nor the chauffeur can see that the other is approach- ing the crossing. Both the train and the automobile arc making so much noise that neither party can hear the approach of the other. Hence, neither is aware of the dan- 201"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN ger that is approaching him. But the man on top of the rock can see them both with perfect distinctness. He can see that they are both traveling at a terrific speed. He cal- culates quickly the distance each is from the crossing. He then estimates the speed at which each is traveling. He finds that dis- tance and speed will bring them to the cross- ing at the same instant of Time. He is in position to see who is driving the automobile, and he knows him well. He foresees, as an inevitable fact of Nature, that there is going to be a wreck, and his reason tells him that his friend is going to be killed. Now, solely because he is at a greater alti- tude than the others, he is able to foresee the inevitable fact of an approaching wreck. He also sees the death of his friend \"in a wreck at a crossing.\" Now, he is not a \"prophet.\" He is sim- ply up where he can see what is happening on all sides of him.

He sees also that if he travels at the same speed along the same road he will reach a certain point just as a tornado travel- ing across his trail will reach the same point. He foresees the result instantly, that the man will be killed in the tornado. That impulse is so strong that it communicates itself to the \"sensitive\" who is in semi-sleep. The sleeper awakes and carries the spiritual vision into his waking, physical consciousness. He re- lates it to his wife, who is the sister of the traveler.

Portraits of dying individuals are flashed to the consciousness of distant relatives and friends on earth in the same manner. Some spiritual intelligence is present who is mutually interested in the dying individual and the living relative or friend. He finds that the relative or friend is sufliciently sensi- tive to spiritual impressions to receive the picture from him. He gives out the impulse with intensity, and the sensitive picks it up as the radio picks up any message that comes over a wave length of ether to which the radio will respond.

But here again may be observed the in- dustrious activities of human imagination, as well as of religious idealism.

While there is always at least one such spir- itual individual for each human infant, there may be a number of others who volunteer their services also to the same child — always, however, subordinate to the one who assumes the chief responsibility. These spiritual guar- dians usually become deeply attached to their human wards and derive great pleasure and satisfaction, not only in the association but also in the services they are able to render.

Based upon my own personal observation, I have never seen anything, so far as I can recall, to suggest that there is a class of ex- alted individuals who inhabit the spiritual world and who are called ''Angels\" — having wings as a distinguishing mark or badge of their angelhood. As a distinctive class of exalted beings, there are no such things as Angels. It is true, however, that it is not an unusual thing upon the spiritual planes of life to see indi- viduals dressed in flowing white robes and wearing upon their shoulders artificial wings merely as ornaments of dress. It is more than likely that the angelic concept had its origin in the fact that some earthly psychics 209"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN may have glimpsed some of these ministering spiritual people going about their work upon the spiritual planes. However this may be, they are, nevertheless, but men and women who, at some time, have lived upon the earth plane, and who have passed from that life into the spiritual life and have found their places among the spiritual workers whose special mission is to serve those who are in need of such help as they can give. From this it can be readily seen that there is some slight basis of truth in the concept of angels, even though it has been distorted by superstitious minds and given a meaning to suit the fancy of the religious idealists. The statement is often made by mediums that two \"Guardian Angels\" always come to one on the physical plane, three days before his death, remain with him to prepare him for the transition and, at death, lead him to his appropriate plane in the spiritual life. The statement is not true, in its essential details. There is, however, a sufficient ele- ment of truth in it to furnish some founda- tion for the statement. As an illustration, it is true that there are always those on the 210"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"GUARDIAN ANGELS spiritual side of life whose work, either vol- untary or selected, is to care for all who, by death, pass from earth life into the spiritual realm. In all cases, where death is the result of any character of illness which enables those upon the spiritual planes to anticipate approxi- mately when death will occur, certain indi- viduals on the spiritual planes, from among the specific workers referred to, are assigned to the case. Sometimes one such spiritual worker alone is either assigned or volunteers. Sometimes two or more are so assigned, or they volunteer, in certain of these cases. These assignments, or volunteers, are se- lected many days ahead of the anticipated transition. Other times they are selected but a few days in advance — depending on the na- ture of the case and what, if anything, they might be able to do to be of service to the individual in their charge. From the time such assignments are made the individuals selected for that duty devote themselves, as far as they can, to the service of the patient, in every way possible.

Sometimes they are even able, by the aid of the physician and nurse in charge, to restore the individual to a measure of health and thus prolong his life upon the physical plane. This is a part of their work, wherever the experience would seem to be of value to the patient. But when the hour of death comes the spir- itual workers who have been so selected are at hand to render every assistance possible to their charge in making the transition. And when the patient emerges from the physical body they receive him, care for him and min- ister to him in every way within their power.

This awakening process, to a full realiza- tion of the new life, and of the meaning of the process called death, oftentimes involves much time and labor on the part of the spir- itual workers and their associates. This calls for the utmost patience, loving kindness and consideration on the part of these \"guardian angels.\" An authoritative statement as to the time this awakening and adjusting process re- quires cannot be given.

In some cases the attending phy- sician finds it necessary to use mechanical means to induce the first physical breath. Whenever the process of suscitation requires the assistance of mechanical means, it may require several minutes to accomplish it. Even so, the incarnating — or reincarnating — Soul, as the case may be, does not enter the bodies of the infant until the first physical breath enters its lungs. And this is the \"breath\" referred to as the \"Breath of Life.\" \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life; and man became a living Soul.\" (Genesis II, 7.)

The Soul has not entered the spiritual body of the infant. Hence, the spiritual body disintegrates with the physical and is resolved back into the ele- ments from which it was integrated.

Children and infants appear upon all the planes of spiritual life. And, they appear there immediately after they have been liber- ated from the physical body by physical death. I have heard positive statements made several times, by mediums, that there are no children in the spiritual life above the first 223"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN spiritual plane. Then, again, there are those who assure us that there are no children be- yond the fourth spiritual plane. There are others who fix the limit at the seventh spirit- ual plane. As explained, the spiritual evolution of an individual at physical death determines the exact level to which he will immediately rise when liberated from the physical body through the process of physical death. If his spiritual development is low when he reaches physical death he will rise to a corresponding low plane of spiritual life. If his spirituality is high at the time of his death he will rise to correspondingly high levels of spiritual life as soon as he is liberated from the physical body through the process of death. But the same Universal Law of Gravity ap- plies to those who die in infancy or in child- hood, as well as it does to those who die after they have reached physical maturity.

This means, when translated into scientific analysis, that there is as much difference in the spiritual evolutionary status of infants and children, at physical death, as there is in the spiritual status of those who have arrived at physical maturity before death overtakes them. We have learned that spiritual unfoldment and development are the results of Spiritual Evolution. This means that an infant who stops in the magnetic field, after physical death, has not attained as high a degree of Spiritual Evolu- tion as the infant or child who passes at once through the magnetic field and stops in the first spiritual plane.

From the moment an infant emerges from its tiny infant body and enters the spiritual world, it goes on growing in size, as well as in mentality. This growth and development of its spiritual body go on very much as it would have proceeded had it remained upon the earth plane. This means that it goes on grow- ing and developing until it passes through all the phases of infancy, childhood, youth and maturity. But there are three essential particulars wherein the spiritual development differs from the physical : (a) Its bodily growth upon the spiritual plane is not so rapid as it is upon the physical plane. To make this entirely clear, while a child upon the earth plane grows to its full physical height and weight in 18 to 21 years, it requires an average of almost twice the same period upon the spiritual side to develop the spiritual body alone to its full size and 227"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN proportions. Why this is so I am unable to tell you, except it would seem that the phys- ical element adds an impulse to the develop- ment and growth of the material bodies, and when this element is eliminated — as in the event of physical death — Nature finds herself unable to complete the process with the same facility as she could have done had the infant remained upon the earth plane until its phys- ical body had been developed to maturity. (b) No matter how old a spiritual being may be, its spiritual body never becomes withered with the marks of age or decrepi- tude. When the spiritual infant reaches its full bodily maturity it ceases to grow in both size and the appearance of age. It always remains what we upon the earth plane would call \"youthful\" in its appearance; although those upon the spiritual planes have no diffi- culty in determining the relative age of any spiritual individual.

This rejuvenation continues until the individ- ual has reached that state and condition of bodily development just referred to as youth- ful. This will explain the experiences of many earthly psychics in their endeavors to identify to their earthly associates the relatives and friends who have passed on into the spiritual life many years before. If the individual passed out of the physical body in infancy, the psychic will see him as a youthful form, ap- parently many years older than the little babe that died. On the other hand, if the individ- ual died in old age, the psychic will see him in his rejuvenated appearance of youth.

These natural dis- crepancies in the bodily appearance upon the spiritual planes — when compared with the appearance of the individual in the physical body at the time of death — will account for all these apparent failures on the part of honest psychics. There is always a strong magnetic bond be- tween a spiritual infant and the physical fam- ily into which it is born.

In this case it does not remain a member of the physical family. It follows the natural law of individual at- traction and harmony. The men and women on the spiritual planes in whom the love of and desire for children in the home are still strong, voluntar- ily seek and take these little ones into their home, care for them, educate them and help them in every way possible in their evolu- tionary growth and development, until they have grown to that age of discretion which stands for \"spiritual majority.\" From that point forward the parental adoption becomes null, and the child is released from all the ties that bound it thereunder.

This means that in whatever line the attention of a child is fixed, and his effort awakened, in that line will he develop most rapidly. Applying this principle to the average child, it will be found that, almost from the day of his birth the conditions of his life are such as to fix his attention upon his physical environment and hold it there during his waking moments. The mother, from the day of her child's birth, seeks to attract its atten- tion to her. The father does the same thing. He seeks to fix its attention upon him.

In these coats are pockets. They use these pockets as con- venient receptacles in which to carry various of their personal possessions. In the northern countries, where the winters are cold, they use these same pockets for the purpose of keeping their hands warm; and in this latter case they are quite as useful as in the former, and convey to the individual consciousness even greater sensation of pleasure.

By many who are not acquainted with the scientific facts, but who are strongly religious, these experiences are taken and accepted as positive assurance of the correctness of religious faith. There are many, however, whose religious faith satisfies them as to the existence of another life, but they do not believe that it is possible for those who have passed into the spiritual life to re- turn and make their presence known to those upon the physical plane. Such experiences as those above referred to naturally have the effect to modify ihcir religious convictions in this one particular. The foregoing facts will suggest something 256"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"WHEN DEATH BEGINS of the care and discretion that should always be exercised by those upon the physical plane in the presence of those who are in the coma- tose condition. Not a word or thought should be expressed, in the presence of the dying, nor in the presence of those in the comatose state, which might not rightly and properly be expressed to the individual if he were consciously awake upon the physical plane of life. If this suggestion were always followed and enforced by physicians and nurses, it would save many a dying individual the most intense agony during the last moments of his physical life — which ought to be made as perfectly peaceful and harmonious as pos- sible. It is hoped that this suggestion may be made of practical value by our future edu- cators in teaching humanity the right At- titude of Soul to be maintained by those in the physical body who are present in the environment of those in the comatose condi- tion.

It is one, however, which means much to the Masters of Natural Science — especially when they are physically separated by distance and conditions which prevent them from meet- ing together physically when such meetings are vitally important to the welfare of humanity. Suspended animation is a condition which any Master of Natural Science has the power to create at will. The vital currents and ac- tivities are simply stopped, or suspended, in their onward flow, without the operation of any destructive, disintegrating process or condition. The vital machinery of the phys- ical organism merely stops at the point where the Master Mind wills that it shall stop. In this condition, however, the individual who controls the process is able to withdraw 2«1"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN the spiritual body from the physical, and vol untarily ^'travel in foreign countries\" without the physical body. He may also return to the physical body, re-enter it, resume the activ- ities of the physical functions at will, and voluntarily restore himself to a normal, phys- ical condition. But while he is out of the physical body entirely, and traveling in the spiritual body alone, there is always a vital, magnetic cord, running between the two bodies. It is the existence of this vital cord which makes it possible for him to return to, and re-enter the physical body at will. If, perchance, during the time he is out of the physical body, anything should occur to break that vital magnetic cord, physical death would occur instantly. In this event, he would not be able to re-enter the physical body, nor cause it to resume its normal functions. The Soul may travel in the spiritual body alone to any distance upon the plane of earth. It may also travel in the magnetic field, and most usually does during that experience. It may, however, reach the plane of the first spiritual. But so long as the magnetic cord 262"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"SUSPENDED ANIMATION remains intact with the physical body, the Soul cannot travel above or beyond the first spiritual plane. This is due to the gravitative pull of the physical body. But there is yet another condition of sus- pended animation. This is, however, the re- sult of the condition which physicians call \"catalepsy.\" The cataleptic state of suspended anima- tion has been known to continue uninterrupt- edly for more than one year, without the slightest perceptible change in the physical condition of the individual. It seldom oc- curs, however, that the individual passes through actual death directly from the cata- leptic state. Whilst this does occur, at very rare intervals; nevertheless, in most instances, a few moments before death actually occurs the physical functions — including the action of the heart — are resumed.

As to the length of time one may be out of the physical body, under such conditions, it depends very much upon the development and condition of the individual. If low in spirituality, he may not remain out of the physical more than a few hours; but if the spiritual development is of a high order and degree, he may remain much longer, even two or three days. In this case, however, ref- erence is made only to the normal condition of profound sleep. It is important to know that, in cases of suspended animation resulting from cata- lepsy, the two bodies are thereby inseparably bound together and the Soul is locked within them so long as the cataleptic condition con- tinues. In such cases consciousness also is suspended. But between Catalepsy and the voluntary Suspended Animation, there are two impor- tant distinctions which should be noted: 1. Ordinary catalepsy is not a voluntary process, while the suspended animation of a Master is entirely voluntary. 264"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"SUSPENDED ANIMATION 2. In catalepsy the two bodies are bound together, and the Soul is locked within them; while in voluntary Suspended Animation, the union of the two bodies is under the con- trol of the Master-Mind that caused the sus- pended animation. By the power of his Will he may cause the two bodies to separate ; and clothed in his spiritual body alone, his Soul may travel at will in the spiritual realms of life.

Perhaps this is true. Judging from the results as seen from the spiritual side of life, it would seem that, in the very large majority of cases, the individual does not at once realize that physical death has transpired. It often occurs that, for some time he labors under the impression and convic- tion that he Is dreaming and that, in due time, he will awake and find himself back in the midst of the conditions which existed at the beginning of his \"dream,\" namely, the instant when death overtook him. Usually he sees his physical body — or, rather, its mag- netic or etheric counterpart; for the physical body itself is not visible to the eyes of the spiritual — and recognizes it as his own. He also recognizes and feels the pull of the mag- netic bond that still attracts him to it.

In either of these cases it often re- quires time and personal eflfort to bring the individual to a fuller realization of the fact that he is really and truly \"dead.\" Slowly and surely, however, he comes to realize that he is no longer in the old physical body, in the midst of the old familiar phys- ical conditions and environment. Then he turns to his spiritual companions and helpers in the hope that they will be able to show him how to make his presence known to those of his loved ones he has left behind him upon the earth plane. From this point it is never difficult to convince the individual that he is, indeed, \"dead\" to all those he has left upon the physical plane of life.

The same conditions, though by no means to the same extent, exist even with those who have thought much upon the problem of death — especially where the individual has entertained strong convictions concerning the spiritual life which are radically different from those he finds when he awakens upon the spiritual plane — or the magnetic field — as the case may be. Indeed, it often occurs that such as these find the conditions of the spiritual life quite as different from their pre- conceived notions as do those who have taken the entire subject for granted. This is espe- cially true of the most ardent and devout religionists whose ministers, priests and teach- ers have mapped, charted, designated and located all the streets, crossings, temples and points of interest in \"The New Jerusalem.\" These also find the new life and country so utterly at variance with the landmarks of the map and chart they have been taught to fol- low as their guide, that they cannot bring themselves to accept the fact that they are 269"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN really \"dead\" in the conventional sense. They therefore assume, as in the other case de- scribed, that they are dreaming and that, in due time, they will awake and find themselves back in the midst of the old familiar scenes and conditions of their former physical life, once more inhabiting the familiar physical body. With such as these, also, it often requires much time, thought and effort, on the part of those whose mission it is, upon the spiritual plane, to help those who go over from the plane of earth unprepared to assume at once the duties and responsibilities of the new life, to educate them into a full and complete un- derstanding and acceptance of the spiritual life just as they find it. With these, also, it is a matter of education. But there are those who approach the new life fully prepared to enter upon its duties, activities and responsibilities. These are they who have arrived at a point in their evolu- tionary unfoldment where they have over- come the superstitions, the religious errors, the doctrinal fallacies and the philosophical prejudices of earth life, and are prepared to 270"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"WHEN DEATH ENDS accept whatever conditions they find, whether consistent with their own philosophical de- ductions, or not. These, while yet upon the earth plane, may not be able to open their spiritual eyes and look ahead of them into the spiritual life and see the conditions of that life as they are, but they have grown to that splendid stature of intelligence of Soul de- velopment from which they can view the world as they find it, freed from either scien- tific, philosophic or religious preconceptions and prejudices. Often these are classed upon earth as \"Agnostics\" — which simply means those who are willing to admit that they 'Vo not know\" what lies beyond this life of earth, but whatever it may prove to be, they hold themselves in readiness to accept it as they find it, and proceed at once to adjust them- selves to the new conditions and make the most of the situation.

This leads naturally to a study of suicide and its psychic effects upon the individual after he has passed into the spiritual life. This study develops some rather startling phases of the subject which, it would seem, should be of vital interest and importance to all who are earnestly striving for happiness and progress. This is a subject that ought to be better un- derstood by people upon the physical plane of life. It involves certain scientific problems which have a powerful influence upon the evolutionary condition of the Soul after death. There is something in the very Soul im- pulse of self-destruction which, when once 273"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN set in motion by the physical act of suicide, continues psychically as a destructive force in the life of the individual, until it is over- come or counteracted, cither by the voluntary or intelligent Will of the individual himself, or until it is reversed through the aid of those who are wise enough to understand the sci- entific process involved. In some respects it is analogous, in its ac- tion upon the Soul, to the action of certain destructive acids upon the physical body. Once it is applied — and the process thus set in motion — it goes on and on until the cause is removed. No permanent restoration of con- structive conditions within the Soul can be established until the Intelligence, the Will and the Determination of the individual him- self can be set in motion to counteract the de- structive processes invoked by the original psychic impulse of self-destruction which led to the death of the physical body. Doubtless a very large percentage of sui- cides are committed under the impulse and desire to get away from painful or unhappy conditions upon the earth plane. The act is committed under the impression that physical 274"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"PSYCHIC EFFECT OF SUICIDE death will accomplish the desired result. In this the individual is profoundly and vitally mistaken: for it is not true. If humanity could be educated to a definite and scientific knov^ledge of the important fact that suicide never evades nor avoids either painful or unhappy earthly conditions, but serves only to plunge the individual into the midst of conditions upon the spiritual side of life even more painful, unhappy and de- structive than he seeks to evade or avoid, sui- cide w^ould soon become a thing of the past. In the case of murder there is no impulse of self-destruction set in motion in the mind and Soul of the victim. The psychic impulse and desire to live are at no time, nor in the slightest degree, interfered w^ith nor dimin- ished. The destructive impulse is wholly and entirely in the mind and soul of the murderer, and not in those of the victim. The latter takes up his life on the spiritual side with all the constructive forces of self-preservation fully alive and active. He begins the new life exactly at the point where he leaves off the old. In no degree nor manner is he han- dicapped by destructive Soul impulses or 275"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN desires. He is still as full of the impulse and desire to live as he was before his transition. All this is different with the suicide, who must reverse all the currents of his being be- fore he can overcome the destructive impulse of his own Soul, which led to suicide. Suppose an individual is under hypnotic control, and commits the act of self-destruc- tion as the direct result of the Will of the hypnotist who controlled him at the time. It will not be difficult for one to realize the fact that the impulse of suicide was not present at all. It was solely and entirely the impulse of the hypnotist in obedience to whose hypnotic command he performed the act. In this case, whom would you hold per- sonally responsible for the death? Naturally you will say the hypnotist, and you are right. In essence the act was that of the hypnotist, although it may have been the hand of the subject that executed the deed. Under those conditions the hand that performed the act was simply an instrument which acted in response to the free and independent Will of the hypnotist. The intent and purpose which resulted in the death were those of the hyp- 27<"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"PSYCHIC EFFECT OF SUICIDE notist alone. For these reasons he alone is re- sponsible. There has been no conscious pur- pose nor intent on the part of the subject to destroy himself. In truth, he is not aware of what he has done, nor of what has been done to him, until he awakes from the hypnotic trance upon the spiritual plane. So far as the psychic effects are concerned, they are precisely what they would have been if some stronger person physically had placed a dagger in the hand of his victim, then closed his hand over it and, by the greater power of his own hand, had caused the hand of the victim to plunge the dagger into his own heart. In this case, as in the other, the intent and purpose to kill were in the mind of the stronger man physically. In truth, you will agree that there was no suicidal impulse or purpose at all. It was the impulse of murder in the mind of the stronger man. You can see at once that the psychic results would be those of murder, and not those of suicide; and they would be the same as those upon one who has been murdered. This explains exactly what would be the psychic results of death under such condi- 277"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN tions. The individual would pass into the spiritual life as free from suicidal impulses as he was at the moment of his physical death. It is merely a question of determining whether death occurred as a result of the con- ^ious, intelligent, independent purpose and intent of self-destruction in the mind of the individual who thus died. There can be no responsibility where there is no intelligence, deliberate purpose and in- tent, independence of Will, and the concur- rent impulse of the Soul. Hence, in the case of self-destruction by one who is insane, the elements of responsibility are entirely lack- ing, and the psychic and spiritual results are exactly the same as if the individual had died a natural death. One phase of the question, however, must not be overlooked. The very condition of in- sanity itself is one which, under certain con- ditions, leaves the individual weakened both spiritually and psychically, for a time. This, however, is entirely due to the insane condi- tion, and immediately upon passing into the spiritual life, such an individual turns to his 278"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"PSYCHIC EFFECT OF SUICIDE task of self-development, and soon overcomes his weakened condition. In the case of one who dies insane solely because of physical conditions — as, for in- stance, because of a fractured skull — physical death results in almost instant recovery. In some instances there may possibly result a short period of confusion, but this is due to other conditions, and not to the physical causes of the insanity. In the separation of the two bodies, the spiritual body sometimes experiences a greater attraction away from earth conditions, requiring a strong effort of the Will, or even outside help, to bring it back into its earthly environment again. This is something which depends upon the degree of evolutionary de- velopment the individual has attained, or the Attitude of Soul that inspires him while out of the physical body. There are many instances where even tem- porary liberation from the physical body would mean death, because the individual would refuse to return and take up the phys- ical burden again. In such cases it is fortu- nate for the race that Nature has protected it 279"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN against voluntary extinction in that way.

It is still a subject of profound interest to humanity. It has never been determined with sufficient authority to develop a method that is acceptable to all classes of society. The methods employed are: (a) Interment, or burial of the body in the earth, where, in due course of time, through the slow processes of Nature, it is gradually disintegrated, dissolved and returned back into the elements from which it was originally integrated. (b) A method of burial in vacuum vaults, so cemented in stone caskets as to exclude all possibility of air, or moisture in any form, from entering the casket. The idea seems to be that this method will prevent disintegra- 281"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN tion and keep the body in a state of preserva- tion indefinitely. (c) Cremation, which means any method of reducing the body to ashes through the action of heat. (d) The method of embalming which re- sults in preserving the physical body, in some degree of perfection, during many thousands of years. This method is based upon certain religious concepts, which need not be ex- plained at this time. (e) Chemical dissolution, which employs the action of chemicals that cause very rapid disintegration. This method has not become general, as yet, upon the physical plane. The process of disintegration by a spiritual chem- ical known to the Wise Men of Science upon the first spiritual plane. Is far more rapid and perfect than that of cremation upon the phys- ical plane; but the purpose is the same, namely, to resolve a discarded and useless body back into the elements from which it came, and thus give it back to Nature for her use in other ways and for other purposes. But it is not always that the spiritual body is thus disintegrated. Like the problem of 282"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"CREMATION disposing of the physical body after death, it is held to be, more or less, under the control or direction or disposition of its former owner. However, it would be for the best good if immediate dissolution and disintegra- tion were required in all cases. There are those on the first spiritual plane who are inclined to take possession of these undissolved bodies, and they often use them in ways which do not appear to be altogether honest or good. For instance, a number of those who are engaged in controlling a me- dium on the physical plane, can make use of one of these discarded spiritual bodies in such manner as to make it luminous, and bring it within the spiritual vision of the medium. Sometimes they can even clothe it with suffi- cient magnetism from the magnetic field to bring it within the vision of those upon the earth plane who are attending the seance. Those upon the physical plane, however, can- not tell whether it is alive or not. Naturally, they take it for granted that it is a living indi- vidual upon the spiritual plane. For this reason, it may be used by unscrupulous spir- itual people to deceive those who constitute 283"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN the more credulous physical sitters in any seance of that nature. Thus, they may be made to believe they have actually seen the ex-carnate individual who formerly inhabited the body, when as a matter of fact, the indi- vidual may be upon a higher plane of life far away at the time. From this you will ob- serve that there are those on the spiritual plane who do not hesitate to practice legerde- main and deceptions upon those on the lower planes of life. Taking all things into account, Cremation is the method approved by the Great Masters and Spiritual Wise Men. The chemical method, however, is even more rapid in its disintegrating results than is the action of fire; but this method is not understood by our physical scientists, as yet, and it involves the action of elements which would put into the hands of the unscrupulous both the power and temptation to do great harm. Hence, this particular chemical formulary has been withheld from scientists of the earth plane, and will not be divulged to them until all doubt as to the wisdom of so doing has been overcome. 314"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"CREMATION At present, therefore, Cremation is the quickest and safest method of disintegrating the physical bodies of the dead, and resolving them back into the natural elements from which they come. One of the express purposes accomplished by cremation is to destroy entirely all mag- netic conditions which might, under any cir- cumstances, constitute sufficient attraction for the spiritual body to hold the Soul in an earth-bound condition. The action of fire dis- solves and dissipates all magnetism of the physical body. One point may not be entirely clear con- cerning the magnetic efifect of the physical body, after death, upon the spiritual. So long as the physical body remains intact it holds within itself sufficient magnetism to constitute some degree of attraction for the spiritual. The degree and power of this attraction de- pend upon a number of conditions, but more especially upon the degree of evolutionary unfoldment to which the individual had at- tained at the time of his death. If the indi- vidual is of the \"earth earthy,\" low in point of intelligence, on the lower rounds of evolu- 285"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN tionary development, devoid of spirituality and morality, the attraction of the physical body will be correspondingly strong. The converse of this is equally true. If the indi- vidual has attained to a high degree of spirit- uality, intelligence, morality and evolutionary refinement, the attraction of the physical body will be correspondingly weak. The particular point it is desired to make clear in this connection is this: No matter what may be the evolutionary status of the individual at death, whether low or high, the magnetic attraction of the physical body does not, in any manner, make the liberated indi- vidual sensitive to anything that may occur to the physical body. In other words, the sense channels are closed between the phys- ical body and the intelligent Soul of the indi- vidual at the instant the separation called \"death\" is complete. Beyond that point the physical body may be subjected to any treat- ment whatsoever without pain or suffering to the liberated Soul, even though the magnetic bond of attraction may exist until the dissolu- tion of the physical body is complete and its particles resolved back into their original ele- 286"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"CREMATION ments. This may serve to make more clear why it is that Cremation, however soon after physical death, does not involve pain or suf- fering of any kind whatsoever to the liberated Soul of the deceased. Conforming strictly to the science of the subject, the moment death occurs and the sep- aration of the two bodies is complete, the liberated individual is not in any manner or degree sensitive to any processes which afifect the physical body. The instant the physical channels of sense are closed — which is true almost the instant physical death occurs, and oftentimes equally true before actual separa- tion is complete — the liberated soul in its spiritual body is completely out of touch, as it were, with the physical body, and com- pletely liberated from all sensations through its sense channels. Cremation may take place at any time after complete separation of the physical and the spiritual bodies of the individual has oc- curred; and this separation occurs within one minute, under ordinary circumstances, after the last physical breath and physical heart- 287"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN beat — except where cataleptic coma exists, as previously explained. Through the teachings of certain occult societies of earth, there has come to be a well- defined notion that where Cremation is em- ployed it should never be used until at least three days {72 hours) have elapsed after ac- tual death has occurred. By the representa- tives of such societies, it is asserted that Cre- mation before that time has elapsed results in the most intense pain and suffering to the \"dead.\" The writer is aware of the fact that such ideas exist on the part of certain occult teachers upon the physical plane. He is glad, however, to be in position to state, with abso- lute certainty, that there is no foundation in fact whatsoever to sustain such teachings. It has been the privilege of the writer, through the channels of his spiritual senses, to witness a number of cremations. He has been with the liberated \"dead\" during the process of cremation. Therefore, the earlier Cremation occurs after physical death, the better it is for all interests involved on both planes of life. Naturally this is a subject concerning which human sentiment exerts a very strong influ- 288"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"CREMATION ence. The mere thought of placing the body of a loved one into the fire and reducing it to ashes seems to be exceedingly repulsive to many intelligent and good people. They know the destructive nature of fire, and al- most inevitably they associate it with the most intense pain and suffering. For this reason it is impossible, as yet, to obtain the sanction of many who would approve without an instant's hesitation, but for the sentiment which rebels at the use of fire in disposing of the physical body of one they have loved. The human mind refuses to grasp the fact that the intelli- gent Soul which occupied the body before physical death is no longer associated with it in any sense. And with these sentiments we must be charitable, for they have their root and foundation in the love-nature of man- kind. On the other hand, can there be anything more repulsive than the thought that the body of a loved one is lying in the ground, slowly disintegrating, and is being eaten by the worms of the earth? It would seem that the sentiment which would reject Cremation would even more strongly and emphatically 289"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN reject this method of burial. But there is no accounting for the vagaries of the human Soul. It does not seem to be bound by any law of consistency. Disinterments of physical bodies of the dead have proven, beyond all question, that a startling percentage of the supposedly dead have only been buried alive. This is due to the fact that there are certain psychic condi- tions, such as catalepsy, and certain forms of trance (through the process of hypnosis and mediumistic control) which so closely re- semble physical death that none but the most expert scientist would be able to differentiate between them and actual physical death. This condition not infrequently occurs in cases of slow, lingering illness, whereby the vitality of the individual is gradually de- pleted. The individual falls into a state of profound coma and is believed to be dead. It is not a pleasant thing to contemplate the experiences of such of these as may regain consciousness after burial, only to die of suf- focation. The problem, as a whole, is both complex and subtle. It reaches in so many directions 290"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"CREMATION and touches so many conflicting interests that its complete solution should be entrusted to those only whose intelligence, judgment and moral concepts are of the most exalted character. Cremation prevents burial alive. It is by far the most sanitary method. It involves least risk of spreading disease among the living. It is clean and wholesome in every respect. Wherever magnetic conditions might have any tendency to bind the liberated Soul to earthly conditions more closely — which is true in a very large percentage of those who die — Cremation destroys that magnetic bond from the physical side and liberates the Soul at once from all physical attraction of earth. This enables the Soul to proceed at once out of the magnetic field, into the first spiritual plane, and there to enter immediately upon its evolutionary pathway and take up the lines of its constructive work among those who are ready to be of service in every way possible. As to the best method of disposing of the ashes of a cremated body, this is wholly a matter of individual choice. If the deceased 291"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN has expressed any wish in the matter before his death, it would seem that such request would be held binding — unless there are con- ditions which make it either impossible or gravely inexpedient. But if no such request has been made by the deceased, and sentimen- tal reasons do not intervene, the ashes may be scattered either upon the earth or on the water. There can be no objection to either disposition, insofar as science and the welfare of humanity are concerned. The embalming process does not dissipate the animal magnetism of the physical body. In truth, it arrests, to some extent, the disinte- gration and dissipation of the magnetic forces and conditions of the physical body and thus preserves, in some measure, the chain of at- traction between the two bodies so long as this condition continues.

This, of course, means total extinction of the animal as a separate, distinct and individualized entity. At first view this hypothesis would appear to be in direct conflict with the very essence of the evolutionary principle. But a further 364"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"THE GENESIS OF DOGMA study and analysis of the subject show that such is not the case. Under this second general hypothesis, in all this upward movement of Nature wc name \"evolution,\" Universal Intelligence is en- gaged in the process of individualizing intel- ligence.

In the animal organism Nature has not yet reached a point in the evolutionary pro- cess where the entity possesses that power. As a natural result the animal disappears from the spiritual plane of animal life in re- sponse to the law of its being, and, if the hypothesis be true, is resolved back into Na- ture's elements from which it came. If this be true, the student is ready to ask, What, then, is the purpose of all the grada- tions of animal life, running from the amoeba to the anthropoid ape? The answer in brief is, that in all this 365"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN multiplicity of animal life, running through all its varied gradations, from the lowest to the highest, we see only the mechanics of a stupendous plan by and through which Uni- versal Intelligence refines and raises the vi- bratory activity of matter on both planes of life, until it is capable of co-ordination with the Soul Element of Nature, which is indi- vidualized in man alone. THIRD HYPOTHESIS In \"Facts Demonstrated,\" it is stated that man disappears from the lowest plane of his spiritual life by either one of two diflferent processes, and in response to the operation of two different and opposite principles: 1. Under the constructive principle and process of evolution, growth, development and progress, he disappears only to appear upon a higher plane, etc. 2. Under the opposite principle and pro- cess of destruction or devolution he also dis- appears in a manner which corresponds, in every essential particular, with the disappear- ance of the animal. It is also stated that in this second case he does not reappear (at least in identical or 366"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"THE GENESIS OF DOGMA distinguishable form) , upon any of the higher planes of spiritual life which are distinctively related to this particular planet. The question of his destiny as an individual intelligence in this case is a matter of even more absorbing and vital interest to those who have undertaken its solution, than is the destiny of the animal. But here again Nature seems to hold a secret. Nevertheless, two working hypotheses or theories have been formulated. The first of these holds that man may, of his own volition, pursue a deliberate course of retrogression in conformity with the De- structive Principle of Nature in Individual Life, until he reaches the point in the down- ward path toward spiritual darkness, where he disappears as does the animal. But, ac- cording to the theory here under considera- tion, this fact does not necessarily involve his individual extinction or dissolution as an indi- vidual intelligence or entity. On the other hand, it is held that he simply falls below the point of co-ordination with the Soul Element of Nature, thereby loses his independent, self- 367"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN conscious and rational volition, and reverts to the plane of animal life. Here he begins the evolutionary struggle under the guiding wisdom and power of Universal Intelligence, until once again he reaches the plane of human life. Here he co-ordinates with the Soul Element of Na- ture, is reinvested with an independent, self- conscious and rational volition and given an- other opportunity to choose between the two alternatives of evolutionary progress on the one hand or devolutionary retrogression on the other. It is still within his power to choose the downward path. If so, and he persists in that choice, he must again descend to the plane of animal life and begin anew the evolutionary struggle under the guiding direction of Universal Intelligence. This process is supposed to be repeated as often as may be necessary to develop in him the natural desire for the higher life, after which he proceeds of his own voluntary choice on the upward course of individual self-development to that celestial destiny of individual attainment and power which lie"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"THE GENESIS OF DOGMA beyond the limits of our present understand- ing. The opposite hypothesis holds that no mat- ter from what heights man may descend, if he persist in his downward flight until he loses his independent, self-conscious and ra- tional volition, under the law of his being he thereby forever forfeits the power of self- perpetuation and Individual Immortality. In this case his disappearance from the spiritual plane means to him precisely what it means to the animal under the Second Hy- pothesis, namely, disintegration, dissolution, individual extinction and a resolution back into Nature's elements from which he came. FOURTH HYPOTHESIS , It is well known that theologians widely differ in their views concerning the ultimate destiny of the persistent sinner. Their dif- ferences hinge, in a general way, upon their various understandings and conceptions of man's immortality. Without taking into account the intermedi- ate shadings, there are two general, theologi- cal dogmas concerning the immortality of the Soul, which, briefly stated, are as follows: 369"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN 1. That man is inherently, intrinsically and essentially immortal. That he is so created. That immortality is a primary and essential property or characteristic of his individual being. That whether saved or lost, in a re- ligious sense, he is in either event immortal and therefore can never die nor lose his indi- viduality. From this particular conception of the soul's immortality naturally follows the doc- trine of eternal happiness for the saved, and never-ending torture for the damned. 2. On the other hand, it is held that the soul is not inherently and essentially im- mortal, but that it may become so by con- forming to the law of God — or Nature — upon which individual immortality depends. In other words, under this theological con- ception man's immortality comes to him as the gift of God. It is the reward of his obedi- ence to God's commands. Or, from the philo- sophic standpoint, it comes to him as the nat- ural result of his own personal effort. It is the logical and necessary result of his obedi- ence to the constructive principle of Nature which is the law of individual life. 370"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"THE GENESIS OF DOGMA From this conception of the soul's immor- tality it follows that the man who does not earn it, or who does not receive it as a gift from God, is necessarily a mere mortal and nothing more. In this case when death over- takes him he goes down to the grave, is eaten by the worms of the earth, his spiritual as well as his physical body is resolved back into Nature's elements, and he perishes forever. In this view of the subject, \"The Wages of Sin is Death,\" and death in this case means total, individual extinction. The reader is reminded that this is a state- ment of ''theories\" only. In it general hypoth- eses have been briefly but carefully stated. They are presented without comment for what they may be worth. No attempt has been made to prejudice the mind in favor of or against any of them.

These four theories are here presented merely as a suggestion concerning the partic- ular lines of thought and inquiry which have 371"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN engaged the attention of those students of Natural Science who have endeavored to solve the great and absorbing problem of the ultimate destiny of animal and degenerate human life and intelligence. About these four theories cluster an al- most endless number of religious and philo- sophic speculations, opinions and beliefs which have occupied the minds of theologians and laymen, physical scientists and their stu- dents, philosophers and thinkers all down the ages, so far as we are able to follow the au- thentic history of civilization. A few of the more conspicuous of these in- numerable opinions and beliefs have been stated, and their relation to the fundamental hypotheses of Natural Science suggested. These, it is hoped, will be of value, in that they may, in some measure, lead to a clearer understanding and appreciation of the man- ner in which a perfectly legitimate scientific hypothesis may be made the basis of innum- erable religious dogmas and philosophic speculations which only serve to confuse the minds and warp the lives of the unscientific and the ignorant.

For this reason they do not fall within the limitations of \"What Sci- ence Knows of the Spiritual World.\" Although the following statements may not entirely satisfy the demands of the critical, scientific inquirer, nevertheless, they betray a degree and quality of intelligence which can- not fail to awaken profound respect in the mind of any honest searcher for Truth.

FIRST PROBLEM Does the human Soul always inhabit a material body through which to manifest itself? In other words, is it possible for the 373"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN human Soul to manifest itself, its presence, its activities, or its powers, in any other way than through the agency of a material body? So far as we know, it cannot. What we do know is that the only authentic knowledge we have concerning the individual Soul of man is that which we obtain through its manifesta- tions. And, the only manifestations of which we are definitely and positively conscious are those which express themselves through the material body, or bodies, it occupies at the time. Upon the physical plane of life, the only positive knowledge we have of our fellow human beings is that which we obtain through the fact that they inhabit physical bodies by means of which they manifest their existence and activities to us. Through these physical bodies alone, and the organs they furnish the Soul for its use in expressing it- self, we have learned all that we now know concerning the individual Soul within, or connected with, each of such physical bodies. The same is just as true upon the spiritual planes of life. All we know of the individual Souls of men and women on the spiritual side S74"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"UNSOLVED PROBLEMS of life is what we learn of them through their material manifestations; and they manifest themselves to us on the spiritual side only through their spiritual bodies. And, so far as we know upon the spiritual planes of life, it is impossible for the Soul to manifest itself in any other way than through the agency of a material body fitted for ex- pression on the plane upon which it mani- fests itself. A Soul without a material body is a phenomenon of which we have no knowledge. And yet, we do not assert, with dogmatic certainty, that such a phenomenon is impossible. The most we can say is that we have no knowledge which would sustain such an assertion, or suggestion, and no evi- dence that would sustain or justify such a conclusion. Moreover, the wisest of our Great Teach- ers upon the spiritual planes of life, have no knowledge or information that would even seem to justify any other conclusion than that which I have indicated. SECOND PROBLEM In the King James version of the Bible there are found a number of references to the 375"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN \"second death.\" This would seem to indicate that the Ancient Wise Men looked upon what we now term \"physical death\" as a first death. This of itself would seem to infer that they knew something of another death than that of the physical body. Indeed, the matter is not left in doubt or uncertainty, for they had in mind some very grave and important event which they named \"The Second Death.\" This so-called \"Second Death\" has been inter- preted by some of our modern religionists to mean \"Spiritual Death.\" There are instances in which the individ- ual does not seem to be ready to proceed at once to climb the ladder of spiritual evolu- tion. Where this is true, when physical death occurs the individual stops in the magnetic field. If he continues in that attitude of Soul he remains there, gradually but surely growing weaker, until the Soul finally with- draws and disappears from view entirely. In these cases the spiritual body speedily disintegrates and is resolved back into its orig- inal elements, analogous to the dissolution of the physical body. We do not know what S7("},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"UNSOLVED PROBLEMS becomes of the Soul in these instances. This is one of the many unsolved problems. I have a very definite conviction, however, that somewhere locked within the innermost recesses of this great problem, is contained one of those profound secrets of Nature which it is not in the interests of the race to disclose to any of us — until we shall have attained to an exalted degree of wisdom, such that it will enable us to make use of that knowledge only for the best good of humanity. While this last described process — or seem- ing spiritual death — would appear, upon its face, to represent a distinctly retrograde movement of the individual Soul, I do not hesitate to say that I cannot bring myself to believe it means the ''death\" or ''extinction\" of the Soul itself. I say this only because, according to my own way of interpreting the Law and the Processes of Nature, there is, and there can be, no such thing in Nature as the total extinction of any intelligent Individ- uality. Let me explain myself more fully: Our physical scientists have found that, in the sublime economy of physical Nature, no provision has been made whereby it is possi- 377"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN ble for even the smallest individual particle of matter to be totally annihilated and de- stroyed. They base their conclusion upon their know^ledge of the fundamental Law of the Conservation of Energy. If their conclusion is correct as to physical matter, how much more vital it is, in the economy of higher Nature, that the same Law should apply to the spiritual universe. While I do not even claim to know, yet I am firmly convinced that the disappearance of the Individuality, or Soul, in the case re- ferred to, means only that we are unable to follow it in its evolutionary migration; but that it still persists as an individualized In- telligence, and will continue to exist, as such, throughout eternity. Accept this, however, as my personal con- clusion — drawn from such facts of Nature, as I have been able to verify — and not as the authorized instruction of Natural Science. THIRD PROBLEM Can a spiritual being commit suicide? There is a process by which a spiritually embodied individual on the spiritual side of life may accomplish the dissolution of his 378"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"UNSOLVED PROBLEMS Spiritual body on any given spiritual plane to which he has attained. In a sense, this might be called \"suicide,\" on that particular plane, but it does not mean the death of the Soul. The result here suggested can be accomplished simply by reversing the course of his life from that of spiritual evolution to the destructive process of spiritual devolution. If he should adopt a destructive and devolutionary course of life and persist in it long enough he would, in course of time, reach a point when and where he no longer could maintain himself upon that particular plane of spiritual life. In that event, his spiritual body for that par- ticular plane dies and the individual himself disappears from the view of his fellows. Moreover, he does not reappear upon any higher spiritual plane, because he has not built himself a spiritual body finer than the one which he has dissolved and disinte- grated. Neither can he fall back upon the next lower spiritual plane, for the reason that he has cast off the spiritual body which be- longs to that plane and to all planes below him. What becomes of him? We do not know 379"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN positively, for it is not possible to follow the individual Soul of man, except as it mani- fests itself through a material body on some definite plane of life. But we have a theory concerning the matter. We believe that in such cases the individual drops entirely out of the spiritual planes of life and, by the in- voluntary process of Nature, is reincarnated in human form upon the physical plane of earth. Indeed, this is one of the incidents of life which seems to us to have no other ade- quate explanation than that of Reincarnation. Hence, we assume that, while it is pos- sible for an individual upon the spiritual side of life to cause the dissolution of its spiritual body through the destructive process of devolution, at the same time, we are wont to account for the disappearance of the in- dividual Soul through the process of Rein- carnation upon a lower plane of life — par- ticularly the earth plane. There are those upon the physical plane of life who die under conditions which cause the entire disappearance of the individual from all our knowledge. He does not appear upon the first spiritual plane, nor even in the 380"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"UNSOLVED PROBLEMS magnetic field. He simply disappears and we are unable to follow either his course or his condition. While we do not know posi- tively what becomes of the individual Soul, or the essential Spark of Individuality, we feel justified in assuming that it follows the same general course suggested by the disap- pearance from the spiritual planes through the devolutionary process. If our conclusion is correct, then there is but one answer as to where the individual has gone. He must have reincarnated in some lower level of life upon the human plane of earth. He may have fallen even below the plane of human life entirely, and found his natural level in the plane of animal life below that of the human. At least, this is the theory of many scien- tists upon the spiritual side of life, as well as upon the physical plane. Doubtless a time will come when this mystery will be solved through definite scientific knowledge, as have so many others concerning the evolu- tionary march of the human Soul toward its ultimate goal of Self-Completion, Individual Completion and Perfect Happiness. 381"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE GREAT KNOWN FOURTH PROBLEM Can a spiritual individual on this planet travel in interplanetary space? Now and then we come in contact with in- dividuals upon the various spiritual planes who tell us they were never born upon the physical plane of this planet.

And there is that in their appearance which would seem to indi- cate that they do not naturally belong to this earth, as do those of us who pass into the spir- itual life through the plane of earth by the process of physical death. They seem to rep- resent a distinct type which does not conform to any of the well-defined types of earth. These are called \"Interplanetary-Spiritual Beings,\" which would seem to indicate that they may have had their physical birth upon some other less developed planet than the earth, and, after having made the spiritual rounds of their own native planet, have evolved to a point where they have been able to overcome the gravitative influence of their own planet, and have come to this earth as the"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"UNSOLVED PROBLEMS next regular step in the pathway of their evo- lutionary development. But this is a subject concerning which the Wise Spiritual Intelligences seldom speak, be- cause they do not feel that they are, as yet, sufficiently learned to speak with certainty.

Having thus overcome the pull of gravity to- ward the center of the earth, it is possible for him to get away from the planet and travel in interplanetary spaces. Such as these are said to gather much knowledge of Nature out in the infinite spaces beyond the limits of this one little planet we call \"earth.\" If this be true, then it is quite possible that individuals from either the seventh, eighth. ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, or thirteenth planes, could travel in interplanetary space.
