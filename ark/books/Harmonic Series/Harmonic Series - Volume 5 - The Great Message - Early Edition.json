The exact time of its birth as an organization is so remote that it is not within the range of historic certainty, and can there- fore truthfully be said to be prehistoric. The remoteness of its antiquity, however, may be safely assumed from the suggestion that it is said to have a record history of more than 100,000 years. If this be any- where nearly correct, it would seem justly to entitle the School to the designation of \"Ancient.\" Indeed, a record history of 10,000 years would establish sufficient antiquity for all practical purposes. During all the years of its existence, how- ever ancient that may be, it has been seeking the most propitious means of giving to hu- manity the benefits of its accumulated knowl- edge. To that end, it has developed many"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE individual Masters and inaugurated many different Movements. It has fostered each of them so long as it seemed to be accom- plishing the constructive purposes for which it was instituted. The Great School of the Masters — by whatsoever name it has been known in the world — is that great Central Source and Reservoir of Knowledge (Religious, Philo- sophical, Moral, Spiritual and Psychical) which the best intelligences of all ages have intuitively sensed and definitely accepted as the great beneficent, constructive, uplifting and progressive influence in the Evolution of Mankind from Spiritual Infancy and Darkness to Soul Maturity and Illumination. It is definitely known that at some remote period whence \"the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,\" The Great School of the Masters came into existence as a definite in- stitution. The exact modus operandi by which this was accomplished is not at all difficult to understand. One of the simplest powers of Spiritual Mastership has ever been that of mental telepathy. By the exercise of this one power"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE SCHOOL it is easily possible for one who possesses it to project his definite thoughts through space, to any distance, and to any other indi- vidual Intelligence who has acquired the same power. By radio men are doing the same thing today, by physical means and methods alone. Through the power of telepathy it was possible for the individual Masters of the remotest antiquity to communicate to each other their wishes and desires. By this method they first came into communication with each other, and later came together physically, at some convenient meeting place, for the purpose of organizing themselves into a definite Association. The primary purpose of such an Associa- tion was to enable them to learn from each other whatsoever was then possible concern- ing Life, Death, The Soul, Immortality, Evolution, Spiritual Life, Spiritual Master- ship and Human Destiny, many of which mysteries they had already solved, in their individual capacities. The first result was the organization of a definite School of Spiritual Knowledge. The"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE logical outcome of this Movement was the formulation of a definite curriculum of study whereby they could best transmit their knowledge to such students as might come to them for instruction, duly and truly pre- pared, worthy and well qualified, and with right motives. The next logical step and objective point of the plans and purposes of such a School was to find ways and means of giving their knowledge — or such of it as would be of im- mediate benefit to humanity — to the world. Each individual Master and Member knew, from personal experience in the course of his own individual development to Mas- tership, that he had achieved success only by and through his exact compliance with Na- ture's laws, principles and processes. One of their most profound scientific dis- coveries was the fact that there is a Moral Order in Nature, and that its principles de- mand of each individual human being, the right application of knowledge and the right use of power. And in this connection they learned the great lesson that the right appli- cation of knowledge and the right use of 16"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE SCHOOL power are those only which result in the constructive unfoldment and greater possible happiness to the individual. They soon were able, through their indi- vidual experiences, to differentiate between the \"Constructive\" and the \"Destructive\" principles and processes of Nature, as well as how to align themselves with the con- structive and avoid the destructive. Let it be said, to the honor and glory of The Great School of the Masters, that it has ever stood for \"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\"; and that it ever and always has utilized its knowledge and exercised its powers for the constructive unfoldment of Individual Intelligence, in direct line with these beneficent principles and results.* Inasmuch as The Great School of the Masters is now, and throughout its entire life has been, a progressive School of Sci- ence in all the departments and on all the planes of Nature, it is not an archaic institu- tion that has become obsolete — as certain in- dividuals seem to think — through stagnation or atrophy.

In other words, it is a progressive and modern School, al- ways wideawake and in the vanguard of scientific inquiry and knowledge. Simply because it is the oldest educational institution known to man is no reason that it has ever allowed itself to become \"static\" in any sense whatsoever. In truth, its very strong- est claim upon the confidence and sympathetic consideration of humanity today is in the fact that it adjusts itself to the progressive conditions and demands of the immediate Present, and at no time allows itself to be- come dogmatic concerning those matters which, as yet, lie within the field of Specu- lation, and beyond the limits of its scientific knowledge. The foregoing will explain more fully, perhaps, than anything else that could be said, why it is that The Great School of the Masters is endeavoring to give its Instruc- tion to the world today through the agency of a New Movement, rath&r than to go op working, as best it might, through and hi"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE SCHOOL cooperation with, the various older Move- ments and efforts of the past. Let it be dis- tinctly understood by the reader, however, that it is not decrying, underrating, censur- ing, nor in any manner detracting from the merits of any of these Movements referred to. It is simply conforming to its own plan and method of procedure, in that it is seeking to make a right use of all the knowledge it possesses, at the present time, for the benefit of mankind, while it is accumulating more knowledge that shall be of greater service in times to come. Nor does it desire to create the impression that, because of its age, or any other consid- eration or fact, it possesses all the knowledge there is to be had concerning any department or plane of Nature, physical, spiritual or psychical. On the other hand, it is con- vinced that, so far, it has accumulated but a comparatively small measure of the scientific knowledge that lies out beyond the limits of that which it has been able to gather during the comparative antiquity of its existence. But, although by comparison it may, as yet, be in the primary grade of the Great Uni- 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE versal School, that fact does not deter nor hinder it from going forward with its work of accumulating more knowledge, as rapidly as possible, that it may be the better qualified and equipped to render a greater and better service to humanity, whenever and wherever the opportunity shall present itself. Neither does it anticipate nor expect that it will ever arrive at a point where there is nothing more to learn. It recognizes the fact that knowledge, insofar as the human individual is con- cerned, is one of the Infinities toward which humanity is moving, with all the room there is in which to continue its moving. But it is, nevertheless, possible to accumulate suf- ficient exact and scientific knowledge to en- able humanity, through the efforts of The Great School of the Masters, to develop a Universal Brotherhood of Man ; and thus enable humanity to cooperate intelligently with Nature in her Evolutionary Plan, to the greater Happiness of all mankind.

There are yet a number of others, but these will be sufficient to establish in the mind of the reader the fact that the name selected to head Part I of this volume, is not a misnomer; but is a name of definite and historic value, as well as of tremendous sig- nificance, in that it embodies all that is in- cluded in the meanings of all the various names above designated, and all the definite 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE knowledge that has reached the world from the Great Central Source to which these various designations and names have refer- ence.

In those ancient days, as in these modern ones, there were Advanced Souls who de- voted their lives and their efforts to a study of the \"Gre-ater Mysteries\" of Life, Death, the Soul, Human Destiny, Life After Death, 23"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Mastership, etc. Then, as now, there were the few exceptional Souls whose individual efforts were rewarded by greater knowledge of the Mysteries than were their fellows who devoted their efforts to the things of this purely physical earth. These Advanced Souls came to be regarded by the masses as \"Masters\" — in some cases even as \"Divini- ties/' The same is equally true of the Advanced Souls of today, as well as of all times. There are \"Masters\" today, as truly as there have ever been at any time within the history of humanity. And these Modern Masters have solved as many of the Greater Mysteries as did the more ancient Masters of Egypt, Syria, Persia, India, and other civilizations. By personal experience they have solved the problem of the continuity of Individual Life beyond the grave; and have made many other discoveries that are, as yet, unknown to the masses of humanity. Can you think of anything more natural and inevitable than the simple fact that the individual Masters who were all seeking for knowledge concerning the same great Prob- 24"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE MASTERS lem of Life — should come together for the purpose of consultation, for the exchange of their knowledge, and for the consideration of ways and means of enlarging what they al- ready had? This was inevitable, just as the same results are always inevitable from the same causes. It is just as true today as it was in the days of the Ancient Mysteries of which we read so much. We are, however, losing sight of one es- sential item of knowledge necessary to a perfect understanding of the primary organ- ization of The Great School of the Masters. Long before there were definite Schools of Mysteries there were individual Masters who had solved the Mysteries. Some of these left the luminous imprint of their knowledge, wisdom and influence upon the world, and it has shone with brilliancy upon the children of men throughout all past ages, and even down to the civilizations of today. For illustration: The Bible gives us Moses and the Master, Jesus. The Zend-Avesta gives us Zoroaster. The life and teachings of the Masters, Buddha and Christna, are more or less familiar as a part of the sacred 25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE literature of all times. These are but illus- trations of the fact above stated, namely, that there were individual Masters long before any of the many Schools of Mystery came into existence. Just how many thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of years back of the Schools of Mystery the first real Spiritual Master lived on earth, is beyond the limits of accessible human knowl- edge today. Hence, it is but a waste of time and effort to speculate upon the subject. This is true of the great Oriental Masters, Christna and Buddha. It is equally true of the Persian Prophet and Master, Zoroaster. It is just as true of Confucius and Pythago- ras, respectively known as the Chinese Mas- ter and the Grecian (sometimes Egyptian) Master. It is likewise just as true of the Masters who have had their inspiration and their instruction concerning spiritual life and spiritual things, in the various Schools of the Ancient Mysteries. But here is a significant fact with which many of our best intelligences of today are not familiar, and it is of so vital and impor- tant a character that it is of supreme imp-or- 26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE MASTERS tance in this particular connection. It is this: All these various Great Masters through- out the past, even down to the present time, were teaching virtually the same philosophy of life, the same religion, the same science — in just so far as they carried forward their individual work and demonstrations. This means that the Masters, Christna, Melchizedek and Buddha, taught virtually the same philosophy of life, or religion, as Zoroaster, Confucius, Pythagoras, and later, the Master, Jesus, taught. Perhaps it would be more literally accurate to say that these great Masters all developed their individual concepts of the Great Problem of Individual Life from knowledge which they obtained, directly or indirectly, from one or more of the various Schools of Ancient Mysteries. For it appears that, whatever differences have been noted in their individual conclu- sions are the results of mere differences in method rather than differences in substance. Or, it may have been that these differences were merely the results of the differing methods of these various Masters in their 27"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE efforts to adapt themselves to the various times and environments in which they lived, as well as the varying facilities they enjoyed for the transmission of their message to the humanity of their particular and respective times and generations. This was true of the earliest Masters of whom we have any knowledge. It was equally true of the endless chain of Masters who later gave their knowledge to the world through the channels of their respective Schools of Ancient Mysteries. They all were teaching only such actual knowledge as they had accumulated concerning the Great Problem — \"If a man die, shall he live again?\" The same is equally true of the various historic Masters of all times. The Master Christna did more, perhaps, than any other single Master to color the life and civilization of the entire Orient. And yet, his philosophy and teachings, which are somewhat voluminous, show that he was a great reformer whose life was devoted to a profound Moral and Spiritual Movement. Nevertheless, he was teaching the same gen- 28"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE MASTERS eral philosophy of life as that of the other Great Masters who followed him. The Master Melchizedek, despite his great importance as a High Priest who estab- lished the Priestly Order in his own name, gave to the world no detailed account of his life and work. But the single fact that Jesus was made \"an High Priest after the Order of Melchizedek forever,\" proves the value and reverence in which the Mas- ter Melchizedek was held. Pythagoras, who received much of his schooling and knowledge of Spiritual Life from the School of Egyptian Mysteries, left the imprint of his constructive influence upon the civilization of Egypt from his own time forward, even to the present. His teachings and philosophy of life have been, and still are, a mighty inspiration to men of all subsequent ages who have been seeking to solve the Great Problem of the continuity of individual life. Socrates, another of the great Master Minds of history, also derived much of his knowledge of the same great problem from the Schools of Mystery, especially the Egyp- 29"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE tian and the Eleusinian Schools. To him is generally conceded the development of the inductive method of reasoning; and the ex- alted moral value of his teachings registered itself upon his students — more especially Aristotle and Plato — and through them upon subsequent civilizations. These were recog- nized as the Master Minds of the age in which they lived (200 to 500 B. C). Their philosophy of individual life, more espe- cially in its exalted Moral Concepts, is clearly identified with the great Central Source of Spiritual Wisdom, The Great School of the Masters. Zoroaster stands out as the Persian Mas- ter of his time. Here again we have a great Soul whose spiritual and ethical teachings show their derivation from the same great Source. Buddha was another Great Master whose influence has colored all civilizations during, as well as subsequent to, that in which he lived. But his teachings were identical, in spirit, with those of the same Great Central Source of spiritual and ethical wisdom, The Great School. 30"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE MASTERS Confucius, to the Chinese, has been the Master influence that has reigned supreme in its dominance (among Chinese civiliza- tions) over all other philosophies. But his philosophy and teachings have also exerted a constructive influence likewise upon vir- tually every other nationality and civiliza- tion of earth, because it came down from the same clear fountain of Truth — The Great School. Bulwer Lytton, the author of \"Zanoni,\" \"Strange Story,\" and other philosophic works, was one of the great English Souls who had come into direct touch with the School of the Masters., and had drunk deeply of their knowledge and wisdom. Though not an accredited \"Master,\" he knew the fundamental principles of life and the ethical formulary of The Great School, and embodied much of that profound knowl- edge in his various writings. Shakespeare, though not designated a \"Master,\" demonstrated in his writings the fact that he, too, had drunk at the same crys- tal fountain of Truth.

If there were no other evidence, his life, ministry and teachings are sufficient to establish the fact of his identification with The Great School of the Masters, and that he received his spiritual knowledge from that great Source. The foregoing are a few of the individual Masters (there are many others) who arose, in the world's esteem, to the dignity of \"Mas- ters,\" and left the sublime influence of their lives and teachings upon the world. They were held by The Great School worthy to speak the great Message of Truth to the world, as far as they had received the In- struction. But these were men, living upon the phys- ical plane of life, subject to all the trials and handicaps of time, place, environment, cir- cumstance, and conditions of the social and 32"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE MASTERS moral development of the people in whose midst they labored and taught.

Hence, the constructive influence of their endeavors was transitory, evanescent, fleet- ing and impermanent.

It is still inspired by the same great and beneficent purpose and is seeking to make a Gift of its knowledge to the children of men, insofar as they are ready, willing and able to receive that Gift and rightly use it. To that end it has been impelled by the following definite and distinct purposes: 1. To exemplify, within its own voluntary association of Masters, the true spirit and relationship of fellow Members in the real Brotherhood of Man, and thus demon- 35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE strate the scientific foundation and fact of such a Brotherhood, possible to all mankind. 2.

To preserve its accumulated knowledge intact for the benefit of Humanity. 5. It has sought, by every just means within its power, to transmit to Humanity of each and every age, such of its accumu- lated knowledge as it knew would be of con- structive and practical value to mankind, more especially to the Individual Human, in his efforts to live his life in such manner as to exemplify the beneficent Will of the Great Father. 6.

In numerous historic instances, it has definitely commissioned its individual stu- dents and members to go out into the world of humanity and deliver its \"Instruction\" to those who could prove themselves ready, willing and able to receive the same and rightly use it for the good of their fellows and for the amelioration of mankind. 8.

The Great Message of the Masters, in its entirety, hinges upon and revolves about the Great Problems: 1. If a man die, shall he live again? 2. If he does continue to live on after the event called physical death, is that fact defi- nitely and scientifically demonstrable to us., or by us, while we are yet inhabiting our physical bodies and living normally upon this plane of physical life? 3.

On what are they based? \"If a man die, shall he live again?\" So long as this remains an unsolved prob- lem to the masses of humanity, it may be anticipated, with practical certainty, that the world will continue to revel in a satur- nalia of sorrow, despair and crime. But just here is the supreme consolation for every honest and earnest searcher for definite scientific knowledge upon the great enigmatical problem. He is no longer com- pelled to walk in darkness, nor to found his convictions as to Life After Physical Death, upon the fleeting intuition of Hope, the shift- ing background of Belief, or the more satis- fying expectation of Faith.

Moreover, the \"Instruction\" of which The Great School of the Masters is seeking to make a Gift to Humanity, covers the method and the process by which the indi- vidual Members of the School have made the demonstration, and by which others who possess the intelligence, ability, readiness and willingness, may themselves accomplish the same thing. 5.

The difficulty referred to is this: The Ancient Mysteries, which are also fre- quently referred to as \"The Greater Mys- teries,\" are quite often mentioned as \"The Mysteries of Antiquity.\" But, whatever name is used, the problem, or difficulty, lies in the fact that these \"Mys- teries\" do not all emanate from the same source.

C. From all the definite information that has come down to us through the literature of the past, it seems to be a fact, beyond serious controversy, that the most ancient School of the Mysteries was that of the Orient, of India. But aside from this, the various Schools of Mystery in the farther west have derived their inspiration and pattern from the Egyptian and Eleusinian Schools of Mystery; many authorities giving to the Egyptian Mysteries the place of honor over the Eleusinian. There can be no doubt that initiation into the Mysteries, by whatever School it may 63"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE have been, whether Egyptian, Eleusinian, Syrian, Phrygian, Magian, or any other of the many different Schools, was accom- panied by the most intense and vivid drama- tization.

All the ritualistic and dramatic ceremo- nials of initiation into the Mysteries, of whatever School, seem to cluster about the fundamental concept of Individual Life, that this earthly hegira is but a journey of the Soul from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge, from human dark- ness to spiritual light. This same concept is preserved even in the various Orders of today, wherein the initiate begins his journey in ignorance and darkness, and is ever thereafter in search of Light, and More Light. In most, if not all, of the various Schools of Mystery, there is dramatized a death and a resurrection, thus showing that, through- out the ages, an abiding Faith in the contin- uity of individual life beyond the physical grave, and in the certainty of another and a 64"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"OTHER MYSTERIES higher life, has had its tap-root in the very soil of the Souls of Men.

In the ceremonial of Initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries there were certain sac- ramental services, some of which, in essence, have come down to the Christian era and found lodgement in the religious ceremo- nials of the various Christian churches. For illustration : In the Egyptian mystical ceremonial of initiation into the Mysteries, one of the important sacramental ceremo- nials was devoted to the principle of Life and Death and the Resurrection, symbolized by the stalk of corn. The planting of the grain in the ground was the symbol of death. It marked the decay and death of the indi- vidual grain of corn.

As the Christian religion has exerted a powerful influence upon the civilizations of the last twenty centuries, so the Mysteries exerted an equally powerful influence over the civilizations of their times and environ- ment.

These individual Masters have, in many instances, accomplished much good, and have helped to spread a more general knowledge of the principles of Mor- ality and Spirituality among the people of their time and environment.

There are others of more recent origin, with which the reader may be familiar. Primitive Brahmanism: It seems hardly fair to designate this great Movement by the name of Brahmanism, since it had its birth in the Soul of one Great Master whose name is not so very familiar to the minds of our Occidental civilization.

The only reason for designating this great Movement \"Brahmanism,\" is in the fact that the early priesthood of that School first adopted the teachings of Christna, and de- voted their energetic efforts to its propaga- tion throughout all India. It spread rapidly and flourished because of the great purity of the Master's life and teachings, until it dom- inated the religious thought of all India.

And today Brah- manism stands for the Evil Genius, the Oc- topus of Devolution which is sucking the life-blood from the children of one of the greatest civilizations of earth. The Order of Melchizedek: This Order marks one of the most important historic epochs in the development of spiritual knowledge. While it is seldom mentioned by modern writers, nevertheless, it has a defi- nite relation to the Great Central Source of authority. Who and what was Melchizedek?

Melchizedek was held by some to have been even a more miraculous creature than Jesus, the Christ, and of greater spirit- ual significance and power. 2.

The Master, Jesus, was \"Made an High Priest forever, after the Order of Melchize- dek.\" 4. Melchizedek lived, and his Spiritual Order was established as early as the sixth century before Christ. 5.

And thus it is that the Order of Melchize- dek falls naturally into line with all the va- rious world Movements that have received the Great Instruction from The School of the Masters, and sought to make it available to all mankind, as a GIFT.

Shortly after its active work had begun to make a profound impression upon the in- telligent and influential minds of the time and country, its central headquarters in Egypt was established at Luxor. It has been said that the great \"Temple of Luxor,\" more often referred to as the \"Temple of the Sun,\" was but the materiali- zation of an inspiration which arose within the Magian School.

It was in existence at the time of the birth of the Master Jesus; and many writers claim that Jesus was a member, and received much of his knowledge, and many of its Moral Teachings, from it and embodied them in his own instructions to his Disciples.

These \"Three Wise Men\" were, in truth, none other than three Masters from The Great School.

The initiates were consequently divided into three classes: The first, 'Audi- tors'; the second, 'Catechumens'; and the third, 'The Faithful.' These doctrines, and the celebration of the Holy Sacraments, par- ticularly the Eucharist, were kept with pro- found secrecy.

This may refer to a kind of trade-unionism among Masons, similar to that of today (unionism and non-unionism). All these practical Builders, of whatever class or designation, are the Masons who, from time immemorial, have devoted them- selves to the practical profession and busi- ness of building with stone, brick and mor- tar, and whose historic footsteps are marked by the enduring monuments of their Craft all down the pathway of human progress."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"PRACTICAL MASONRY Indeed, just how far backward along the beaten pathway of civilization these historic monuments of Masonic Craft have been planted, hath not been chronicled by even the remotest historians of whom we have any definite and dependable knowledge.

A very wide diversity of opinion has ex- isted among writers on the subject as to the exact age of this marvelous Temple.

Modern archaeological investiga- tion and study of the Pyramid itself and its connection with the Sphinx, which was but recently discovered, justifies the conclusion that the Pyramid was erected as a Temple wherein the Greater Mysteries were taught and aspiring candidates were initiated into some Great Mystical Order.

Of course, we must not take these figures to be absolutely and unqualifiedly authentic. On the other hand, they are at best but the estimates — in other words, the guesses — of our most learned men who are devoting themselves to uncovering the ancient history of the human race upon the Earth.

It is true, however, that there were a good- ly number of individual Lodges, in both Scotland and Ireland, of a much earlier date.

It remained, therefore, for England to take the initiative in so vital and venturesome a move. In the year 1717, therefore, a joint convocation of four of the oldest and most important Lodges in England was called. At this convocation these four Lodges organized and established a General Grand Lodge for the control of all Masonic Lodges within the jurisdiction of England.

It was the direct result of the work of The Great School. It was planned as a \"School,\" with the authority to establish branches, or lodges, wherein definite Courses of Study should be given to those who were found worthy. This was not a mere lesson in ritualism to be committed to memory for purposes of lodge work, nor for Masonic identification, as the instruction given in our lodges of Speculative Masonry so generally obtain today. Indeed, it was only by the method of pro- cedure then employed in the lodges of Oper- ative Masonry that the Initiate could prove to his Elder Brothers that he had made \"suitable proficiency\" to entitle him to \"pass on,\" and receive \"further instruction.\" Just what this personal instruction con- 159"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE sists of, involves and includes, would no doubt be a profound mystery to the average Brother Mason of today. This is because there is nothing in the ritualistic ceremonials of Speculative Masonry of the present time to parallel it. If he were informed, therefore, that the Instruction referred to had specific reference to certain scientific knowledge entirely tran- scending this purely physical plane of life and activity, he should not be condemned if he should hesitate to accept the statement as literally true. Such, however, and nevertheless, is liter- ally the truth. And it is just here, in this particular respect, that Operative Masonry, throughout past ages, has differed from our modern School of Speculative Masonry. In the ancient School of Operative Masonry, before an Initiate could ever become a Mas- ter Mason, he must be able to demonstrate that, through the application of his Instruc- tions to his own personal development, in the distinct lines of Morality, Spirituality and Soul Growth, he had acquired the independ- ent power of clear Spiritual Vision. In the 160"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH long course of his study, work and prepara- tion for admittance into the Master's Degree, however, there were many other things he must be able to demonstrate as a result of his instructions. It is but fair to the reader to know that there have been Masonic writers of intelli- gence and ability who have denied that there ever has been such an institution as a Lodge of Operative Masonry. It would be but logical and natural that Masons of this char- acter should protest against the fact that Freemasonry, whether Speculative or Oper- ative, or any other kind, ever involved a defi- nite educational training for the express pur- pose of unfolding within the Initiate the spiritual senses and powers necessary to en- able him to demonstrate, within himself, the existence of a spiritual Life and a spiritual World of Matter that can be differentiated from the distinctly physical life and physical World of Matter.

As illustration : One of the most ancient Masonic docu- ments, well known to Masonic historians and writers and held by them in profound esteem as a real Landmark in Masonic Literature, is that remarkable document known as \"The Muses Threnodies,\" by H. Adamson of Ed- inburgh, Scotland, published in 1638. This wonderful document may still be found among the archives of Edinburgh Lodge No. 1. Among many other things of purely Ma- sonic significance and value, it contains the following: \"We have the Masonic Word and Second Sight; Things for to come we can foretell aright.\" 162"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH No intelligent Brother Mason can fail to understand that the expression \"Masonic Word\" has direct and definite reference to the \"Grand Masonic Word\"; which would mean that this old Edinburgh Lodge No. 1 was, at this time, still receiving its \"Word of Instruction\" from the great Central Source of Masonic Knowledge — The Great School of the Masters, back of it. It is important to bear in mind that this document was written almost a century be- fore the School of Speculative Masonry, as such, was born — 1717. This means that it was written at a time when Speculative Masonry, as such, did not exist. Furthermore, it was written by one of the most distinguished and revered Ma- sons of his time. It is, therefore, certain that he was writing of the things he knew to be true. He was not speculating, nor guessing, nor romancing. He was narrating facts, and making history. From what School of Masonry did that historic document emanate? There was but one in existence at the time from which it could have emanated. That was the School 163"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE of Operative Masonry, as herein designated.

To what did the distinguished Brother re- fer by \"Second Sight\"? He was writing of his Lodge and its possessions. The \"Second Sight\" to which he referred, was unmistakably the \"Prophetic Vision.\" This fact is made clear and explicit by the expression that follows: \"Things for to come we can foretell aright.\" In other words, the Lodge still had the power, through its proper officials, to proph- 164"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH esy correctly; that is, with spiritual vision look into the future and foretell correctly the things that would surely occur in the future. The author is aware that the average Brother Mason is not a great student of psy- chology, and that he has done little delving into the mysteries of \"Occultism.\" He knows virtually nothing about the development of \"Spiritual Vision,\" or the \"Prophetic Vision.\" He is not to be condemned, there- fore, for his skepticism or even his disbelief in the possibility of such spiritual develop- ment. There was a time when the writer was just such a skeptic. Nevertheless, he was willing to learn; and there came a time when he not only learned, but when he developed — under the Instruction of a Master — the \"Prophetic Vision,\" as well as the clear \"Spiritual Vision\" which enabled him to open his spiritual eyes with as much ease and naturalness as he can open his physical eyes.

These are simple facts, arid not for the purpose of \"mystifying\" the reader; but, on the con- trary, causing him to realize that the realm of \"Spirituality\" is something concerning which he cannot afford to dogmatize. For, so sure as he does, he will suffer the exquisite humiliation of having to admit that he was a prejudiced disbeliever, without reason or evidence on which to base his skepticism. As a practical verification of the fact that the \"Prophetic Vision\" is as truly a fact to- day as it was in the days of the ancient \"prophets,\" the reader should know that there are today members of the Masonic Fraternity who have developed \"Prophetic Vision,\" as perfectly as did any of the Prophets of Old. One of these is the close personal Friend and Brother of the author. He lives in the State of Michigan, and is a fellow-worker with the author in giving to the world a definite knowledge of the Grand Word of Instruction, from the Masters.

However, will any Friend or Brother who may be skeptical as to the literal truth of these statements, give even one good, or sat- isfying reason why the power of true proph- ecy should not exist today as well and as truly as it existed in the days of the prophets mentioned in Scripture?

This is because it will help clear the way for a sympathetic reception of the Message.

The existence of such a Lodge of Opera- tive Masons has been a mooted question for 168"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH many years, among modern Masonic writ- ers; and yet, directly in the face of their dis- cussion they mutually agree that there is a very ancient \"School of Wisdom\" from which Freemasonry of today, as well as of all past ages, has inherited the sublime sys- tem of Morality and Philosophy of Life, so beautifully expressed in the ritualistic cere- monials of the Lodge of Speculative Ma- sonry of the present time, covering the Blue Lodge Degrees. Here are certain most interesting and sig- nificant facts not widely known among, nor familiar to, the average Mason of today: 1. The \"Grand Masonic Word\" was not a mere syllabic word, capable of being spoken by one Mason to another, but a great In- struction communicated by The Great School of the Masters to the School of Op- erative Masonry. 2. This Instruction was divided into three distinct courses, or departments. One of these was exclusively for the benefit of the \"Entered Apprentice\" — in the Operative Or- der of Masonry. It embodied, in the most minute detail, the Moral and Philosophic 169"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE teachings of The Great School back of Op- erative Masonry, necessary for every such Mason to know in order that he might prove himself duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified to pass on and receive the fur- ther instruction of a Fellow-Craft. The En- tered Apprentice could not pass to the de- gree of Fellow-Craft until he was able to prove, under the most rigid and searching examination, that he had made \"suitable pro- ficiency in the preceding degree.\" It might take him one year, or two, or even ten, to accomplish the necessary work of \"prepara- tion\"; and it might be that he would never, in this life, be able to prove that he had made the necessary \"proficiency\" to enable him to enter upon the instruction of a Fel- low-Craft. That was a matter which de- pended entirely upon himself, his intelligence, his economy of time, his devotion to a study of the instructions, and his conscientious work of \"preparation.\" But whenever he had accomplished the task laid out for him by the Master and was able — whether in one year or twenty — to prove, to the satisfaction of his Instructor, that he had made \"suitable 170"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH proficiency,\" he was immediately permitted to enter upon the Instructions for the next higher degree. Whilst the instructions for the Entered Apprentice were devoted to the acquisition of an exact and definite knowledge of the detailed principles, findings and teachings of The Great School of the Masters, covering the subject-matter of the \"Greater Mysteries\" of Individual Life, Death, the Soul, the Spirit, etc., and the Moral Principles and Philosophy on which to establish a construct- ive life; the instructions for the Fellow- Craft were devoted to a searching study of himself as an Individual Intelligence— a self-analysis, in order that he may know how to apply the principles and teachings of the Entered Apprentice degree to himself and his own personal life as a Fellow-Craft. As in the case of the Entered Apprentice, this profound course in self-analysis might take him one year, or it might take him twenty; but he could not go beyond that point until he had done the actual Work, and had acquired the definite knowledge. For it was by this means and method only 171"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE that he could ever prove to his Instructor that he had made \"suitable proficiency\" in the preceding degree to entitle him to fur- ther consideration. Indeed, he might never be able to prove his \"proficiency\"; but that was a matter for him alone to determine, and he could not furnish a substitute, nor by any other method evade or avoid the definite personal effort necessary to acquire the knowledge himself, in his own right. 3. The Instructions for the third degree — that of Master Mason — were devoted to assisting the candidate in learning how to make a definite and practical application of the principles and knowledge of the Entered Apprentice degree to himself and his own life, in the light of the knowledge of him- self, as an Individual Intelligence, he had acquired by the searching self-analysis of the Fellow-Craft's degree. And here again it was he alone who must do the Work. He could not delegate it to any other, any more than he could delegate his eating and sleep- ing to another individual. In this third degree — that of Master — wherein he alone must make the practical 172"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH application of his knowledge of the \"preced- ing degree\" to himself and his own life, is wherein he achieves results entirely tran- scending the purely physical life. By the practice of the Moral Principles and Philos- ophy of The Great School in his own life, he finds, in due time, that he is developing powers above and beyond anything he ever before has dreamed of. One of these is the power to sense a finer world than the purely physical. Then he comes to realize himself as a Spiritual being inhabiting a physical body. And then follows the natural devel- opment of his Spiritual Vision. He is able, by the exercise of this higher vision, to see into his spiritual environment, and realize that it is peopled with spiritual inhabitants with whom he can communicate with as much facility as he can communicate with his physically embodied Brethren of the Lodge. The crowning development of this Mas- ter's degree was that, under instruction and personal direction of his \"Guide\" — whom he was admonished to follow and fear no dan- ger — he finally became able, by his own per- 173"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE sonal efforts alone, to withdraw his spiritual body from the physical and travel, at will, in the world of spiritual matter, life and intelli- gence. By the exercise of this newly devel- oped power he could travel to any distance, observe the conditions of spiritual life, con- fer with the denizens of the spiritual world, and return again to his physical body and resume his life upon the physical plane, as if he never had been absent from his physical body. And this was the original meaning, in the Master's Degree of the Operative Lodge, expressed in the clause: \"To Travel In For- eign Countries,\" etc. This idea was appro- priated bodily by the Speculative Order, in its Master's degree, wherein the candidate is made to say that he desired to become a Mas- ter Mason so that he might \"travel in for- eign countries and receive a Master's wage.\" How vastly these ancient Instructions, and the scientific application of them by the can- didate, to his own personal development, lifted the ancient Operative Master above the level of anything realized by the Master in the Speculative Order of today, can scarcely be conceived by even the most 174"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH learned and intelligent of our modern Ma- sons, at the present time. Indeed, when the matter is viewed from this higher aspect; it is little wonder that the Master Mason of today should be some- what skeptical as to the existence of Opera- tive Masonry. But if he will take the known facts, and study them in the light of simple logic, free from prejudice, he will come to realize, as many another good Mason before him has done, that a School of Operative Masonry is absolutely the only explanation of the march of Masonic Knowledge, and the wonderful Moral Concept and Philoso- phy of Life so beautifully embodied, sym- bolized and dramatized in the ritualistic ceremonials of modern Speculative Masonry. Conforming to the conditions laid down by The Great School of the Masters back of Masonry of all kinds, and all times, it was one of the essential requirements that the Master of each and every Lodge of Opera- tive Masons should be able to demonstrate to his Instructors in The Great School: 1.

That he was able, of his own free will and accord, to withdraw from his physical body and \"travel in foreign countries,\" etc. This will more fully explain the real meaning and significance of the ancient doc- ument by our revered Brother H. Adamson, of Edinburgh Lodge No. 1, before referred to. In that document he was but making clear the fact that his beloved Lodge was still receiving the \"Master's Word of In- struction\" from The School of the Masters, and was likewise in possession of the \"pro- phetic vision.\" Here is another item of information that will be of interest to Brother Masons. In the Speculative Order of today there are but three important positions, namely, East, West, and South. The Worshipful Master is in the East, the Senior Warden in the West and the Junior Warden in the South. This means that there is no officer in the 176"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"CHAIR IN THE NORTH North, which is \"in darkness.\" The fact that there is no official occupant sitting in the North is a matter that has caused much speculation in the minds of many Masons. In the Lodge of the ancient Operative Or- der, however, there were four official chairs, filled as follows: The Officers in the East, West, and South were the same as in a Lodge of our Specula- tive Order. But the most important position of all was in the North. This was the position of the High Priest. Thus, in the Operative Lodge the North was not left \"in darkness,\" but was the point from which emanated the \"Divine Light of Truth/' This is a complete explanation of why it is that in our modern Speculative Order there is no officer in the North. It is be- cause the Great Instruction embodying the knowledge of Spiritual Light and Truth, was withdrawn or \"lost.\" The Speculative Order, therefore, does not need a High Priest in the North, because all his work in the Lodge was embodied in the Word of In- struction which was \"lost.\" 177"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE In the ancient Operative Order, the High Priest was the official Instructor of all can- didates, and therefore one of the most vitally important officers of the Lodge.

For the same reasons, he is looked upon as one of the most impor- tant officers of the Lodge. While it is true that the Order of the Magi of today has be- come, more or less, a speculative order, nev- ertheless, it still preserves the ancient re- quirement that the Master must always be a \"Seer,\" and be able to demonstrate his knowledge of a Spiritual Life.

If the reader will remember, the Order of Melchizedek was a Priestly Order. It was inaugurated by The Great School of the Masters, as a definite movement through which to deliver its Word of Instruction to humanity. This fact would account for many things: 1. It would account for the fact that the \"Order of Melchizedek\" was still in exist- ence during the life and active ministry of the Master Jesus. 2.

For illustration, the Plumb, Square, Trowel, and Level, the chief me- chanical implements employed by Practical Masons, are all employed by Operative Ma- sonry in their ritualistic ceremonies. The completed building, or Temple, is likewise employed as the most significant and beauti- ful symbol of all. These symbols are em- ployed in Operative Masonry to symbolize 181"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE the various virtues, moral precepts, or ele- ments of human character. The Temple it- self is the completed result of the combined efforts of all Masons working upon it with all the tools of their profession. What is more beautiful and appropriate than the concept that the completed Temple built by Practical Masons, is the symbol of human Character? It is the ideal which the Master Builder of Practical Masonry has in mind as the finished result of all the efforts of himself and all his fellow-workmen. When the Temple is completed, the Master Builder is happy in the realization of his ideal made manifest in material form. Every Operative Mason has in his mind an ideal Character toward which he is working all the time. But in one particular this sym- bol is not perfect, in the following respect: The Master Builder of a material Temple has the benefit of the assistance of all classes of Masons engaged with him in the prac- tical work of construction. Not so, however, with the Master Builder of the Temple of Human Character. The Master Builder in this case is the individual himself; and in the 182"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"MASONIC MORALS building of his own Temple of Character, he must not only have the perfect ideal in his mind, toward the completion of which he is steadily working; but he must do the work himself, and do it alone.

True, whenever he needs help in the formation of the Ideal of his own Char- acter, he may have the help of an Instructor, to crystallize his Ideal. And in all his work of building, he em- ploys the symbols of the various working- tools employed in the building of a material Temple. In the first degree, designated the \"En- tered Apprentice Degree,\" the Lodge seeks to inculcate and thoroughly impress the fol- lowing principles: 1. Economy of Time, Industry. 2. Freedom From Vice and Super- fluity. These are taught by the symbolic meanings of the Working Tools of the Initiate, which are the Twenty-four-inch Gauge and the 183"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Common Gavel. In a beautifully worded exposition of the meanings of these symbols, the Initiate is taught that the Twenty-four- inch Gauge is an instrument made use of by Practical Masons to measure and lay out their work. It, being divided into 24 equal parts, is emblematical of the 24 hours of the day, whereby the Initiate is taught to divide his Time into three equal parts, which he will endeavor to utilize as follows: Eight hours for the service of God and worthy distressed Brothers; eight hours for his usual avocation; and eight hours for re- freshment and sleep. This is to teach him how to economize his time to the best advan- tage, covering each day fully in exemplify- ing a busy life of service to God, to his Brethren and to himself. The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by Practical Masons to break off the rough corners of stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use; but through the appli- cation of its Moral Principle to himself, he is taught to divest his heart and conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting his Mind as a living stone in 184"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"MASONIC MORALS that Spiritual Building, that house not made by hands, eternal in the Heavens. 3. Caution. The Initiate is given a \"new name,\" that of \"Caution/' He is instructed by the Mas- ter of the Lodge that inasmuch as he has been instructed, thus far, in the mere rudi- ments of Masonry, he should be very cau- tious over all his words and actions, espe- cially when in the presence of the enemies of Masonry. This virtue is carried through all the teachings of the Blue Lodge, and is one which has done much to develop and main- tain the solidarity of Masonry, as a Brother- hood. 4. A Listening Ear, a Silent Tongue and a Faithful Heart. He is taught that these are the \"three precious jewels\" of an Entered Apprentice Mason; and they are explained to him in substance, as follows: The Listening Ear is to teach him that he is to listen most attentively to the Instruc- tions he shall receive from the Master, from time to time; but more especially that he shall listen to the cries of worthy, distressed 185"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Brother Masons. The Silent Tongue is to teach him to be silent while in the Lodge, that the Peace and Harmony thereof may not be disturbed; but more especially is he enjoined to be silent in the presence of the enemies of Masonry, that the Craft may not be brought into disrepute through his impru- dence. The Faithful Heart teaches him ever to be faithful to the Instructions he shall re- ceive from the Master, from time to time; but more especially does it teach him that he must be faithful and keep the Secrets of Ma- sonry, as well as those of a Brother, when given him in charge as such, that they shall remain as safe and secure in his own breast as they were before he received them from his Brother. 5. Truth and Union. He is then given two definite \"check words.\" Their names are \"Truth\" and \"Union\"; and these are explained to him somewhat as follows: Truth is a divine attribute, and is the foun- dation of every virtue. To be Good and True is the first lesson every Mason should learn. He is admonished to reflect upon and 186"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"MASONIC MORALS study the subject intently, and by the dic- tates of Truth endeavor to regulate his con- duct so that Sincerity and Plain Dealing shall characterize all his acts, and his heart and tongue shall join his Brethren in pro- moting each other's welfare and rejoicing in each other's prosperity. Union is that quality of Friendship which ought to be exemplified by every Mason. It is so closely allied to the divine attribute, Truth, that he who enjoys the one is seldom destitute of the other. 6. Generosity and Service. By a clever subterfuge the Initiate finds himself entirely destitute, and when the Mas- ter asks him to contribute something of me- tallic kind, as a memorial of his Initiation, he finds that he has absolutely nothing with him, and cannot even borrow so much as a button from his fellows in the Lodge. He is deeply humiliated and embarrassed by his helplessness. Then the Master says to him, in substance: \"Let this be a powerful lesson to you. Let it teach you that, if ever you should see a friend, especially a Brother Ma- son, in like destitute condition, you are 187"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE bound to contribute to his relief, as liberally as his situation may require, and the Ini- tiate's ability will admit, without material injury to himself or family.\" 7. Uprightness. By the upright position and attitude in which he is then placed within the Lodge room, he is informed by the Master that he stands there a just and upright Mason; and he is admonished ever to walk and act as such. 8.

One point should not be overlooked, with reference to Operative Masonry. It is this: As above stated, the Grand Word of Instruc- tion was withdrawn from Operative Ma- sonry, as such, that is, as a definite Organiza- tion, shortly before the Birth of Christianity.

Thus, it can be understood and ac- cepted as a simple fact, that old Edinburgh Lodge No. 1, which had received the \"Word\" at the time of its birth as a Lodge of Opera- tive Masons, had gone ahead, from year to year, complying with the Instructions, and creating its Masters. With each succeeding dispensation, or new election of officers, its High Priest and Master were still actual \"demonstrators of the Law,\" and had received from their personal Instructors the \"Word,\" and under that \"Word\" had developed the \"second sight\" spoken of in the ancient docu- ment quoted in a previous chapter.

By this failure, they \"Lost\" the Word of Instruction, and all the spiritual powers resulting from its exemplification; and by its own gravity, the Lodge passed out of existence, as an Operative Body; and if it still retained its identity as a Lodge, it fell into the class of Speculative Masonry. This is what happened to Edinburgh Lodge No. 1. It ceased to practice the teachings and Instruction, thereby lost its spiritual powers; and, because the Instruc- tions were secret and were never reduced to writing or other means of preservation, they were \"lost,\" so far as the Lodge was con- cerned. 312"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"GRAND MASONIC WORD But this fact should be of profound in- terest and inspiration to every Brother Ma- son, in that it shows how it may be possible to reverse the process and find the \"Lost Word\" of Instruction again; provided The Great School of the Masters has a duly quali- fied Instructor who can restore it to Free- masonry again.

One qualifying explanation is necessary to make clear and definite the relation which modern Freemasonry sustains to The School of the Masters. It is this: While the foregoing facts will make clear to the reader that The Great School of the Masters is the real Great Source from which the exalted Moral Concepts of modern Ma- sonry emanated, they do not make clear the fact that those Moral Concepts and Princi- ples came to modern Masonry indirectly, through the Order of Operative Masonry as that Order is defined in this work. In truth, in this fact is revealed one of the \"fictions\" which found its way into Specula- tive Masonry, and would mislead its Initiates into the belief that Speculative Masonry originally had the \"Grand Masonic Word of Instruction,\" and that it was \"Lost\" to it with the death of Grand Master Hiram Abif, at the building of King Solomon's Temple. This is not true, because it is not possible. 223"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE The only two \"Masonic\" Orders in existence at the time of the building of the Temple were the Order of Practical Masonry (which actually built that Temple), and the Order of Operative Masonry, which had long pre- viously received the \"Word of Instruction\" from The Great School of the Masters. In preceding chapters it has been made plain that our present Order of Speculative Masonry did not come into existence, as such, until 1717 A. D., although it is clear that there were individual Lodges of a Specula- tive character as early as 1500 A. D. It has never been claimed by any Masonic historian that Practical Masonry ever re- ceived the \"Grand Masonic Word,\" or ever had it. And there is not the slightest evi- dence to be had that it ever did receive or have it. This disposes of the suggestion that our present Speculative Order of Masonry may have received the \"Grand Masonic Word\" from Practical Masonry; and leaves only one other possible source from which that \"Word\" could have been delivered directly to the Order of Speculative Masonry prior 224"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"GRAND MASONIC WORD to 1717.

And to these individ- ual Lodges it became \"lost\" only because of their failure to comply with the \"Instruc- tions\" which constituted the \"Word\" itself. It is believed that the logic of these facts will make clear to the reader that the death of Grand Master Hiram Abif had very lit- tle to do with the \"loss\" of the \"Grand Ma- sonic Word of Instruction,\" so beautifully and wonderfully dramatized in the confer- ence of the Master Mason's degree in our modern Speculative Order of Masonry; but that the dramatization of that degree was chiefly for the purpose of teaching the les- sons of Morality therein embodied, and noth- ing more. 325"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE And this conclusion is in strict accord with the well-deserved claims of leading Masonic authorities throughout the world, namely, that Modern Speculative Masonry is a \"Moral Science, veiled in allegory and illus- trated by symbols.\" Its ritualistic ceremo- nials and dramatic initiations all confirm the truth of this definition of present Freema- sonry, as an organic institution. Perhaps there is no part of the Masonic ceremonials that more clearly demonstrates the fact that it is \"veiled in allegory\" than does the third, or Master Mason's degree. It is an allegory, from first to last; and it is most beautifully told and likewise \"illustrated by symbols,\" for the purpose of emphasizing and impress- ing its Moral Precepts and Principles per- manently upon the mind and memory of the candidate.

It is assumed that each and every Brother Mason who shall read the Message, will have this question in mind, whether he openly formulates it into words or not. It is a ques- tion which, by every legitimate rule of con- duct, he has a right to ask, and he has an equal right to expect as direct, complete and definite an answer as The Great School of the Masters can give, within the limits of its authority and abilities. 231"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Here is the answer: 1. The Masonic Fraternity of today (the Speculative Order), is a duly and legally organized Institution; but, at this time, it has no national, or centralized organization. Its highest authority is vested in the Grand Lodge of each and every state in the Union. Other than that of fraternal courtesy, there is no bond or obligation which binds the supreme authority of one state (its Grand Lodge) to respect, obey, or in any way, be bound or governed by the edicts, findings or judgments of the supreme authority of any other state. 2. This gives us forty-eight different \"su- preme authorities\" (State Grand Lodges) which must get together and come to an agreement upon anything involving innova- tions, or modifications, in the generally ac- cepted traditions of the Masonic Order, as such, before it is possible to effect, through the Order, as such, any change from estab- lished usage, of a progressive or evolutionary nature. 3. Perhaps there is no more \"conserva- tive\" Institution on earth than the Specula- 232"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"BROTHER MASONS tive Order of Freemasonry. To the correct- ness of this statement the most prominent Brother Masons in the United States will agree. Without the least disposition or atti- tude of criticism, this conservatism of the Grand Bodies has become so conspicuous that active and progressive Brothers of the Craft generally have come to regard it as a static condition. It is, at least, an internal state of such unresponsiveness as to make ed- ucational or evolutional development within, or progress of the Order, as such, virtually impossible. This Message of the Masters is of such nature that its constructive value, if it were addressed to the Order of Speculative Ma- sonry, as an Organization, would demand action of a character that never would result from any Body that has become static. If the Masonic Fraternity of this country ever should become nationalized, to the ex- tent that the forty-eight state Grand Lodges should come together and organize a Na- tional Grand Lodge, the Order might then become dynamic instead of static; in which event many truly great things would almost 233"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE inevitably follow — \"for the good of the Or- der,\" and the greater good of Humanity.

Nothing contained in this volume must be construed to mean that there is anything of a hostile, critical or inharmonious nature in the attitude of The Great School of the Mas- ters concerning the truly Great School of Modern Speculative Masonry. Dr. Buck in \"The Genius of Freemasonry\" makes it very clear, that the Institution of Freemasonry is engaged in a Great Work of 255"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Education. It is founded in Morals, and teaches a distinct Philosophy of Life. Its Great Work of Education, therefore, is that of inspiring its votaries and members to an application of the fundamental principles of Morality, and to the living of a Life in har- mony with those Moral Principles. In this it is doing exactly what The Great School is trying to do. Moreover, the funda- mental Principles of Individual Life taught by these two Great Schools, are the same, in just so far as Masonry goes. Up to that point, therefore, there is absolute harmony in both the methods and purposes of the two great Organizations. Hence, they could not be enemies. On the other hand, they should be, and are, the most sympathetic and fraternal Friends. The fact that The Great School of the Masters has reduced its educational system to a basis of ex?xt science, thus proving the profound fact that Morality is based upon a Moral Order in Nature, and is therefore itself an exact science, and the further fact that it carries its scientific Educational Work into all the realms of Nature, physical, moral, 256"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"BROTHER MASONS mental, spiritual and psychical, should con- stitute no cause for inharmony between it and Freemasonry.

If five brothers should start from Hollywood, California, to go to Chicago, one traveling afoot and alone, another by horseback, a third by automobile, a fourth by the Overland Limited railroad train, and the fifth by air- plane — there should be no conflict between them, nor the least inharmony. They are all starting from the same point, and they are all going to the same place. It is merely the matter of the method of travel that divides them at the very start. And the results will be that the exact number of miles traveled by any of them will differ somewhat from the number of miles traveled by each and all of 257"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE the others; and the time consumed in making the journey will be different in each case. But the great fundamental fact remains, that they all made the journey, each in his own individual way, and that they all arrived at the same goal, Chicago. Now, what is there in this situation, or in the conditions accom- panying it, to arouse antagonism in the mind of any one of the brothers? This is a fair illustration of the relations existing between the two Great Schools — The Great School of the Masters and The School of Speculative Masonry. They are traveling the road leading from Ignorance (compara- tive) to Knowledge. They both seek to ar- rive at the same goal of how to Live in such manner as to obtain the largest measure of Life, Liberty and Happiness, to both them- selves and those with whom they come into personal contact. The only point of differ- ence between them is the specific method of travel they adopt.

Surely not. For once more, the only point of difference is in the method of travel, and in the fact that, in this instance, one of them traveled on beyond the goal of his brother, and in so doing explored new and wider fields of knowledge. He thereby accumu- lated more knowledge, because his vehicle of travel enabled him to save time over his fel- low, and thus go on a little farther. The illustration will enable individual readers of this volume, in future, to make clear to any critic or doubter, the fact that there is absolutely no enmity between The Great School of the Masters and the School of Freemasonry. They are fundamentally the same in principle. Their purpose is identical. And they are in absolute Har- mony as far as they both go.

It is, indeed, the Modern School of the Masters, and not the \"Ancient,\" that is now speaking to humanity. It has now reduced its Message for hu- manity very largely to written form, and couched it in the modern language of exact Science.

This does not mean that this solution of the Great Problem was accomplished through purely physical means, methods and instru- mentalities. To clear the mind of the reader on this point, let it be admitted that, with all the knowledge of the Masters upon the sub- jects, they have never, so far, been able to reduce the scientific solution to a purely physical basis. They are willing to concede that, so far as they are concerned, such a purely physical solution is impossible to one yet in the physical body.

They designated these finer senses \"Spiritual Senses,\" to dis- tinguish them from the \"physical senses.\" The world into which they were able to penetrate consciously through these finer senses, they called a \"spiritual world.\" Thus began the scientific solution of the great problem of another life in a finer world of matter.

Having once accepted the responsibility of a Message-Bearer and Instructor for The Great School of the Masters, any failure to avail oneself of every possible modern facil- ity, accomplishment, or qualification within reach would be justly condemned as delib- erate negligence and a willful avoidance of Duty, as well as a violation of Personal Re- sponsibility.

The perfect rationale of all this is so clearly and openly apparent that the intelligent, even though hostile, reader will never make the mistake of construing it as merely an expres- sion of inordinate egotism or abysmal igno- rance.

Moreover, from the infancy of the human race upon earth, there have been individuals who have devoted their physical lives to the study of the Great Problem and the effort to solve it. And in every age, so far as we have definite knowledge, there have been a few, often a very few, who have developed what is known throughout all history as \"second sight.\" In these modern and scientific days it is called \"spiritual sight.\" From time immemorial these individuals 274"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE PROBLEM who developed Spiritual Sight, were known as \"Masters\" and \"Seers.\" This means those who have mastered the Great Problem, and have demonstrated through the power of vision that physical death does not destroy the spiritual body nor the Soul which ani- mates it.

Indeed, we know today that a vast store of definite knowledge of the life after physical death has been accumulated. Best of all, however, we know the exact method and process by which the Great Problem of another life may be solved — by those who have the Intelligence, the Cour- age, the Perseverance, the Time, the Instruc- tion, and the Facilities necessary to do the personal Work of making the Personal Dem- onstration.

As a result of this accumulation of exact knowledge upon the subject, there is today a vast Reservoir upon which humanity may draw, as rapidly as it is qualified to receive the knowledge and use it only for the good of humanity.

He was a member of the English Psychical Research Society, at the time, and because of our mu- tual interests in that great institution, we soon found ourselves in sympathy as to our lines of respective study and inquiry. At the time he was rather inclined to a noncommit- tal attitude as to the Great Problem. In later years, however, after more mature consider- ation, he seems to have become profoundly convinced, not only as to the fact of life after physical death, but also of the fact that the denizens of that life are made up of the physically disembodied individuals who pass from this physical life through the process 281"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE of physical dissolution, and are always with- in \"hailing distance\" of those yet in the phys- ical body who have gained the knowledge of how to communicate with them.

It later develops that during most of his scientific life he was a quiet, unassuming, courageous and deter- mined scientific investigator of the subject. Not until the years of individual study and personal experience gave him the right to speak with scientific certainty upon the sub- ject did he come out boldly and invite the same humiliating condemnation which was heaped upon the brave soul of his great con- temporary scientist and fellow student, Sir William Crooks.

Thus once more was verified the inevitable fact that — \"Truth crushed to earth will rise again.\" Had it been possible for the Master Jesus to deliver his Message of Light to the world in writing, or in some other form that would have preserved, in letter and spirit, the exact words that came from his lips, there can be not the least doubt that the humanity of the whole earth today would magnify his name a thousand fold, and that the beneficent Mes- sage of Humanity, in the exact words of the 305"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Master, would have accomplished the spirit- ual regeneration of the whole earth.

It ap- plies to each and every individual human being upon earth. It is, therefore, a matter which the indi- vidual alone can control, or determine. Neither The Great School nor its Instructors can make a Gift of its Instructions, nor of the broad and liberal education which its necessary curriculum includes, until the indi- vidual has arrived at such a degree of Intel- lectual Unfoldment and Understanding, and developed such a standard of Morality that will enable him to receive the Gift and use it constructively. If illustration of this seeming handicap i needed, it may be found in every graded pub- lic school in the land. \"We have children in the primary grade, say from six to eight years old; in the second grade from eight to 327"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE ten; in the next higher grade from ten to fourteen years, and so on up to the High School. The primary student of six to eight years must begin in his own grade. He cannot be- gin in the High School. Why? Because he has neither the intelligence nor the under- standing necessary to the knowledge taught in that grade. The only way he can ever arrive at the door of the High School and gain admittance, is by the process of Educa- tion laid out in the graded school system. It is merely a matter of his making the neces- sary effort and doing the Work that will un- fold his intelligence, understanding and abil- ity to a degree that will entitle him to \"enter and be received in due form.\" The Oppor- tunity is never withdrawn. It is there all the time, and will remain there so long as he lives and the School continues to exist; and at every moment of that time, whether it be two years or fifty, the Opportunity is open for him and awaiting him.

He must make up his mind, before he applies for admit- tance, that he will be content to begin at the beginning and travel the entire route without deviation, for this is the only way he can re- ceive the Instructions. As a general rule, those who come to the Great School of Natural Science, asking for gratuitous instruction, seem to have the im- pression that they are entitled to some special consideration; that they are \"exceptions\" and should not be held to the definite curriculum of study nor the rules and regulations of the Great School of Natural Science with refer- ence thereto. One of the most usual requests made by applicants for admittance into the School is, that they be permitted to follow a \"special course\" that will require much less Work, save much time, and avoid much de- tailed study.

It is the exceptional student, or Initiate, or applicant, who does not ask: \"How long will it take me to complete the Work and be able to demonstrate my knowl- edge to others?\" The Great School of Natural Science does not hesitate to confess that it cannot answer such a question for any individual. It is very doubtful whether or not it would if it could. It cannot answer the question because every- thing depends, in such large measure, upon the individual Student, or Initiate, himself. 334"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"THE PROCEDURE If he puts in but one hour in each twenty- four in doing the Work, he can figure out for himself that it will take him something like ten times as long as it would if he devoted ten hours of each day to earnest study and endeavor.

Then, again, it may be possible for the Ini- tiate, or Student, to devote these three years and still be a long way short of the internal unfoldment, or state of being, that would en- able him to become a \"Demonstrator of the Law.\" If his Work and Personal Effort are of so negligible a quality as not to result in his steady unfoldment and Soul Growth, he might continue indefinitely without becom- ing a real Demonstrator of the Law.

By conforming his life to the Construc- tive Principle and Process alone, it is possi- ble for him to progress, unfold his individual powers, improve his condition, and increase his liberty and happiness. 2. By conforming his life to the same principle and process alone, it is possible for him to discharge his obligation to the Moral Order of Nature.

And it is but natural and courteous to assume that every one of them will truly believe that he is \"duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified\" to receive the Gift of Instruc- tion which the School is ready and willing to give to those who are justly entitled to re- ceive it. For the purpose of answering as many of the legitimate questions in the mind of the prospective Student, or Initiate, as possible — within the limits of space for that purpose — The Great School of Natural Science, with- out any desire to humiliate or otherwise dis- 347"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE courage any worthy student from asking for the Gift of Instruction, simply offers the fol- lowing suggestions and recommendations for serious and thoughtful consideration: 1. The Great School of Natural Science desires to make clear to its prospective Stu- dents and Initiates, especially to its appli- cants, that while it is in no way asking or soliciting patronage; nevertheless, it holds itself ready to respond as promptly as may be possible to every individual who shall apply for admittance as a Student, or Initiate.

If any applicant shall not be willing to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the official literature of the School, before being accepted as a Student, or Initiate, he may know that he is not yet ready for the Gift. This, however, does not mean that he is required to purchase the Text Books of the 348"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"THE INITIATE School for that purpose; because these books are in many, if not all, of the public libraries; and if the applicant is not financially able, or for any other reason does not desire to incur the expense of purchasing the books and making them a part of his personal li- brary, he will, with comparatively few ex- ceptions, be able to obtain access to the litera- ture of the School without cost to himself. The purpose of this explanation is to assure the public that there are no cunning, or clev- erly devised tricks, in the background of its plans and purposes, to exact any material compensation, or other reward, for the In- struction, provided the applicant shall be able to prove that he is entitled to receive the Gift. It is merely a question of his ability to satisfy the School that he is deeply in earn- est, and that he is duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified and justly entitled, upon his own individual merits, to receive the Gift which the School has to offer to those who are entitled to receive it. It is quite as anxious as any applicant can possibly be, to make the way for his admit- tance as rapidly as may be consistent with 349"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE the laws, principles and processes of his edu- cational unfoldment and Soul Growth. To this end it has reduced its demands and requirements to the basis of exact and definite science. It can do no more. Everything else depends upon the individual applicant who seeks to enter and be received in due form. 3. In the experience of the past, there have been those who have protested against the requirement that they must take the ini- tial degree work along with \"mere begin- ners,\" or because of their intelligence and education and long study of the Text Books, they do not need further preparation. The School has experimented with these, and has found it dare not make concessions in behalf of any such individuals. Wherever it has done so, in every instance such students have failed to make good. In most of such in- stances, the Student has proven, before he has gone far, that he was actuated by noth- ing more worthy than pure Vanity of Intelli- gence, and that he was really and truly not worthy to enter along with the most simple- minded, unenlightened, and illiterate Stu- 350"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE INITIATE dent who could meet the requirements of Studentship. With these experiences in the background, it would seem unnecessary to explain further that no applicant will or can be received into the Work, unless he is ready and entirely willing to begin at the very beginning of the formulated study and proceed as if he were the only applicant to be considered. There is not a single lesson but will give him some item of important knowledge or information he would have missed had he been permitted to pass over any part of the Work, however simple and seemingly familiar. Time is of no importance whatever to the Student, as compared with the knowledge to be gained in the various degrees of the Work. And until he comes to realize this fact, he may count himself among those who are \"not ready.\" 4. Whilst the School is ever and always earnestly seeking to advance the interests of the Work, and the benefits to society, never- theless, experience has taught it that the act of soliciting, or even inviting, men and wo- men to apply for Studentship, or Initiation, 351"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE is but opening the door of failure to the indi- vidual Initiate, as well as disaster to the Work. Unless and until he can say, in all sincerity, that he comes to the door of the School of his own free will and accord, with- out solicitation or invitation from anyone, and gives his own knock, he is not yet duly and truly prepared, nor worthy and well qualified. 5. Another vital problem is in the motive which impels the applicant to ask for admit- tance into the School and the Work. A very considerable number of those who come, of their own free will and accord, and ask for admittance, are moved very largely, if not entirely, by the purely phenomenal aspects of the Work. They seem to think that the only purpose to be accomplished, that is worth the time, attention and personal effort of the individual, is the development of their spiritual senses, so that they shall be able to open their spiritual eyes at will and see into the spiritual realms of life and enjoy the ac- complishment of being \"natural psychics.\" Nothing was ever more completely out of harmony with the real Spirit and Purpose of 352"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"THE INITIATE The Great School of Natural Science, and its Work. The prospective Initiate who sees no farther than that and whose motive and purpose have no higher aim, is selfish to the last degree. For he is seeking only to de- velop his spiritual senses and powers that he may enjoy the experience and the personal distinction of holding communion with the inhabitants of the spiritual world, and thus advertising himself to the world, as a Nat- ural Psychic. He is seeking to achieve Mas- tership, not for the good he may thereby accomplish, but for the gratification he shall be able to enjoy. And herein is where many intelligent men and women fail to make a just and correct analysis of their own motives and purposes. The very largest number of those who seek admittance into the School because of their desire to develop their spiritual senses and powers, that they may know personally of the other life, would not know what to do with the knowledge if they had it. And they do not realize the sublime Ethical Principle in Nature which increases the burden of their responsibilities with each and every item of 353"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE added knowledge they acquire, and in exact proportion thereto. If they but realized this great Ethical Principle, a goodly number of them, at least, if not all of them, would defer rather than hasten the acquisition of such personal knowledge, until they knew beyond all question of doubt, that they would be able to discharge their added burden of respon- sibility incident to the possession of such knowledge. Here is another item of information which many d.o not realize, viz: (a) The mere ability to see into the spir- itual world and see those who inhabit that life, does not necessarily mean that the indi- vidual is any more truly \"spiritual\" nor \"morally\" any better, nor more useful to hu- manity than if he were spiritually blind. (b) This will be apparent to those who understand the nature of spiritual medium- ship. Through purely subjective methods of hypnotic or mediumistic control, one may be able to develop subjective clairvoyance, so- called, and be able to see spiritual people about him; but all the while he may be growing less and less independent spirit- 354"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"THE INITIATE ually, and lower and lower morally; indeed, such as these may do violence to every Moral Principle of Life, and yet have subjective spiritual vision. This fact is proven over and over every day, within the limits of Los An- geles, or any other great city. (c) It is only the power of independent spiritual vision which comes from the Living of a Life in conformity with the Moral Or- der of Nature; only the achievement of spiritual vision that rests upon Morality which is the basis of true Spirituality, that means real spiritual development along con- structive lines of unfoldment. And he who develops this quality and character of Spir- ituality pays for it in Personal Effort and Soul Growth. It is this individual who knows that the Spiritual Unfoldment that is constructive is always based upon Morality, and involves added personal responsibility with each new development of personal knowledge.

Rather, he will prefer to go 355"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE more slowly, so that he may be sure of the character and quality of his development and know that he shall be able to sustain it upon the basis of Morality. It is not unnatural, nor wholly unreason- able, that he should be looking forward with the anticipation that when he has finished the third Course of Study, he will be admitted to a course of \"Technical\" training that will enable him by a more direct route, to develop his spiritual senses and complete the Dem- onstration. This, however, is not true. In truth, when he has completed the Third Course, he is then but just at the beginning of his personal work of applying the Principles he has learned to the Living of His Own Life. And henceforth, let him remember that it is only by the Living of the Life that he evolves himself to a point whence the development of his spiritual senses constructively becomes possible.

But let him be comforted by the assurance, that when he has done the Work, Lived the Life, and earned the Right, he cannot be de- nied the unfoldment that will enable him to make the personal Demonstration of another Life constructively. In all this he learns that, whoever the ap- plicant may be, he must prove, at even* step of the way, that he has the ability-, the will- ingness and the readiness to meet every re- quirement of the Law of Individual Life and Constructive Unfoldment.

These are matters over which the School and its individual Members and Instructors have no control. They depend absolutely and entirely upon the applicant. Before he can receive the Instruction, he must prove to the School, or to its examiners, that he is duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified, and has made suitable proficiency in the work of preparation, to entitle him to the benefits for which he asks.

Remember always that you are not being asked to become a Student or Initiate; and that whatever steps you decide upon, in that regard, must be of your own free will and accord ; and that you are asking for that which must be a Gift to those who receive it. If you bear these things in mind, you will not be inclined to refuse any information asked of you. 9.

In other words, \"Infant Damnation\" is not a part of this philosophy. Individual ignorance is not an insurmountable obstacle in the pathway of any individual who is hon- estly and sincerely seeking the Light of Truth.

It has been demonstrated that, of all the many and various Brotherhoods thus far at- tempted, in every sphere of human endeavor and activity — political, social, economic, re- ligious, fraternal, and philosophic — not one has succeeded, nor can succeed, on the bases therein employed. There are two definite, specific and suffi- cient reasons for this which cannot fail to appeal to every intelligent student of the sub- ject, when personal bias and prejudice have been put away, or overcome, and the subject is considered from the standpoint of cold facts and unanswerable logic. The two reasons referred to are these: 1. The a Tie of Mutual Interest\" which 369"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE must represent the foundation and inspiration of every Brotherhood, is found, in each and all of those above referred to, to be pro- foundly selfish. It will not be difficult to understand and appreciate the fact that Self- ishness is a most insecure, precarious, fallible and, in truth, fatal foundation on which to erect the Temple of Human Brotherhood. The \"tie of mutual interest\" among the mem- bers of any so-called Brotherhood that is based upon Selfishness (because that inspira- tion inevitably breeds discord and disinte- gration) must, in the very nature of things, dissolve and soon lead to the downfall of every such institution. It is universal his- tory and will repeat itself whenever and wherever men come together on such a basis. 2. Its membership is strictly exclusive. That is to say, it is limited to a single class of individuals, and closes its doors against all others. The fatal weakness of every such attempt at Brotherhood lies in the fact that it is founded in \"Selfishness,\" and lacks the vital element of \"Universality.\" Any attempt to found a Brotherhood upon 370"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN such a foundation, whether it be political, economic, social, religious, philosophic, or fraternal, must inevitably fail, just as it has always failed, because that sort of founda- tion is fatally defective and cannot endure. The element of Time and the pull of Grav- ity alone will, sooner or later, topple into the dust of the earth any building, however tall and majestic in appearance, whose founda- tion is fatally defective. This is axiomatic and beyond all possible controversy. By the unerring process of logical deduc- tion, therefore, the great Universal Brother- hood of Man we seek to establish, or pro- mote, must be founded on UN-selfishness (Altruism) and possess the vital element of Universality. This means: 1. The \"tie of mutual interest\" which binds its members together must be one that also binds them to all humanity. Their pur- poses must be such that they do not work for themselves alone, but for the equal good of all mankind. This is the tie of unselfishness (altruism). 2. The membership must not be limited"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE to any single class, but must be open to all mankind. This means it must be universal; and this is the \"element of universality\" re- ferred to. 3. And this means that, when the tie of mutual interest which binds the members to one another also binds them to all mankind; and when the opportunities for membership are not limited to any one class, but are open to all who can prove themselves worthy, the organization is one that is founded upon uni- versal interest and universal opportunity. But there are the two enduring conditions upon which alone the relations of man to his fellows may continue indefinitely. In other words, we are now considering the two fundamental or basic conditions, or prerequisites upon which alone the social structure may endure indefinitely — Mutual Interest and Mutual Opportunity. In any organization or association of hu- man beings, if the tie of Mutual Interest does not exist, or should cease to exist, one of the enduring conditions is lacking; and the indi- viduals composing that organization, or asso- ciation, will inevitably drift apart, and go 372"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN their several ways; or, they will create dis- sention, discord, strife and contentions. It does not require a Seer, nor a Prophet to an- ticipate the inevitable outcome. So sure as the destructive elements and activities of Na- ture will, in time, dissolve the hardest gran- ite back into its original elements, just so sure will lack of mutual interest destroy the per- manency of any social, political, religious or fraternal Brotherhood. And this is because one of the two vital and essential props is absent from the foundation. Time and Grav- ity alone will wreck it, so sure as the absence of heat (which means \"cold\") will destroy an orange grove. In other words, if any of the vital essentials, elements, principles or conditions of Nature are absent, there is absolutely no human, social or humanitarian organization that will or can endure. It now but remains to show, beyond every possible question, that The Great School of the Masters, and its modern American agency, The Great School of Natural Sci- ence, constitute a real Brotherhood of Man, with a foundation which contains every vital element, principle, condition and prerequi- 373"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE site necessary to its continuity and endurance. The simple fact alone, that The Great School of the Masters already has \"endured\" throughout every historic age, to a time when the \"memory of man runneth not to the con- trary,\" must be an item of evidence to every intelligent man, that its foundation is vastly more substantial and \"enduring\" than any of those upon which our modern social, polit- ical, economic, religious or fraternal Broth- erhoods have been builded. This one fact may serve to remove, from the mind of even the most critical and skep- tical, whatever bias or prejudice he may have had to contend with in his desire for, and his willing acceptance of, the Truth — from whatsoever source it may come to him. But there is no desire to curry favor with the reader, in behalf of any School or Asso- ciation of Men. The desire is only to remove unreasonable and unfounded prejudice from the minds of those who are truly in search of Truth. That is all. If the Great School cannot meet the conditions fairly and squarely upon the basis of exact Facts, it should be rejected as promptly and with as little re- 374"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN luctance as should any of the more modern Brotherhoods which have been erected upon defective and insufficient foundations. We are in search of Truth, and it is earnestly hoped and confidently believed that we are following its trail with such accuracy and certainty that we are going to overtake it be- fore we are through. Once we are able to follow it to its hiding-place, we shall surely have the courage to stay with it until we have captured it and made it our very own. Now for the \"Test\" : 1. The \"Tie of Mutual Interest\" which binds together the membership of The Great School of the Masters, as well as those of The Great School of Natural Science, con- sists of the following mutual purposes: (a) To acquire the largest measure of ex- act and definite knowledge concerning the Great Problem of Individual Life, here and hereafter. Is not this a \"tie of mutual interest\" that is of equal importance and vital concern to all mankind as it is to the individual members of the Great School? Beyond all question. (b) To preserve that knowledge, in such 375"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE manner that it shall not be destroyed and lost to the Great School, as such, nor to its indi- vidual members, nor to humanity. Is not this an equally unselfish and altruis- tic tie of mutual interest which is as vital to all humanity as it is to the School itself, or to its individual members? Again there can be no possible question of doubt. (c) To add to, or increase, the volume of exact and definite knowledge concerning the great Problem of Individual Life and Destiny, as far and as rapidly as may be pos- sible. Is not this also a tie of mutual interest to the School and its individual members, which is of equal interest and value to all mankind? Once more, there can be but one answer, and that is in the affirmative. ( d) To make a Gift of its knowledge to the world of humanity, as rapidly as the indi- vidual members of the human family can and will avail themselves of that opportunity. Here, again, is it not equally true that the tie of mutual interest is one that is of equal value and concern to all humanity, as it is to the School and its members? This is so 376"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN obvious that no intelligent individual will find objection. (e) To help humanity, through the Gift of its knowledge, to receive an education that will serve to enable a vastly larger num- ber more rapidly to qualify themselves to receive the Instruction from the Great School, and themselves become Instructors to pass on the same Instructions to their fellows, as rap- idly as they can qualify to receive them. Where could it be possible to find a more unselfish and altruistic purpose than that just defined? In these five distinct underlying motives and purposes, The Great School of the Mas- ters, and its modern agent and representative, The Great School of Natural Science, have proven conclusively that the first of the two basic and vital prerequisites and essential conditions of \"Universal Brotherhood\" has been met, without equivocation or mental reservation. That is to say, the Tie of Mu- tual Interest is both unselfish and altruistic, as well as Universal. It affects and applies to all humanity as well as to the School and its individual members. 377"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE 2. It now remains to show with equal con- clusiveness, that the second fundamental prerequisite and vital condition of Enduring Permanency is met with equal frankness and sincerity. This has reference to \"member- ship.\" The following are the facts: (a) The Great School of Natural Science does not limit its students, or members, to any one class of humanity. (b) It opens the door wide to all man- kind, regardless of \"race, creed, color or pre- vious condition of servitude.\" This means that the \"Opportunity\" to gain admittance into its membership is Universal. It does not exclude any individual or class of individuals from that Opportunity. Nature herself has fixed certain limitations of Intelligence in the case of each and every human being. In like manner, Nature has so decreed that no two human individuals possess exactly the same moral development. But, the Gift of Instruction which The Great School of the Masters and its repre- sentatives have to offer to all humanity, is of such character that only those who have at- 378"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN tained to a certain degree of Intelligence, Understanding and Moral Development can receive the Gift, however generously and uni- versally it is offered. Hence, at any given time, it is not every one who asks for the Gift that has all the necessary qualifications and the ability to re- ceive it. But the mere fact that he is not qualified today to receive the Gift does not mean, or even imply, that, with study and personal effort, he shall never qualify to receive it. In truth, the Opportunity for him is never withdrawn nor withheld — except in case of his inability to qualify for the reception of the Gift. And he has the ever-present and appealing \"Opportunity\" to go forward with his work of unfoldment and education, until he shall be able to overcome or remove every hindrance or impediment in his way. And whenever he shall be able to prove himself duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified, and to have made suitable profi- ciency in his own development, the \"Oppor- tunity\" is still there awaiting him. All he has to do is to reach out and take it. 379"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE There is one final problem yet to be deter- mined. It is this: Is it possible for any Institution — however altruistic its purposes, and however universal the Opportunities it offers the prospective members and students — to establish a \"Uni- versal Brotherhood of Man\" upon an Edu- cational basis alone? This depends entirely upon the following conditions: 1. The character and quality of Educa- tion to be given and received. 2. The amount and scope of that Educa- tion. 3. The extent to which it involves the Life, Liberty and Happiness of Mankind and covers the field of human activities and con- structive efforts. if the knowledge it has to give to its ini- tiates were only such as pertains to this purely physical life — such as, for instance, knowl- edge of mechanics, knowledge of finance, knowledge of horticulture, knowledge of astronomy, knowledge of botany, knowledge of mathematics, knowledge of economics, knowledge of politics, etc., it would be con- 380"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN ceded without discussion that these do not cover nor comprehend the Great Problem of individual Life, Liberty and Happiness, here and hereafter.
