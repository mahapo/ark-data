E. RICHARDSON, TK. Vol. Ill HARMONIC SERIES This book carries a hope, a message, a suggestion and a warning to all who arc honestly, patiently and persistently seeking to prove that Death does not end all. It shows that there is a great difference between Belief and Real Knowledge, and proves that mere beliefs are not of any value to the one who would prove that there is a life beyond the grave. He must Know and Do, and this book points the way. It is unique in that its statements are verified farts which every reader may prove for himself under right guidance, if he but have the \"Intelli- gence to know, the Courage to dare, and the Per- severance to do.\" The philosophy taught in this book appeals to both Reason and Conscience, and is an inspiration to \"Live the Life and Know the Law.\" The science and philosophy it presents agree in all essentials with the demonstrated facts of mod- ern physiciaJ science, but go beyond them into the realm of the Spiritual World. There it presents an entirely new field of personally demonstrated facts, which enlarges the scope of hitherto accepted science, and points the way to new discoveries. In this, as in any other science, the investigator is confronted with certain definite propositions and is given a working formula for their solution. In this, as in any other science, successful solution depends chiefly upon the individual ability, capac- ity and character of the student. $3.«0"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jhe^t fSW:HOLOGICAL p?IME U/ie Philosophjoflqdii/idudlLife"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Great Psychological Crime The Destructive Principle of Nature In Individual Life Vol. II HARMONIC SERIES Revised Edition By J.

They represent the two great fundamental and essential op- posites in Nature which are known and rec- ognized by scientific thinkers and investi- gators everywhere. Ethically considered, there are but two fundamental principles in Nature. In their relation to individual life the one is construc- tive, or what we are accustomed to regard as \"normal,\" and the other destructive, or \"ab- normal.\" Every fact of Nature, whether scientific, philosophic, political, religious or otherwise, aligns itself as a direct result of one or the other of these two fundamental principles in operation. The great problem of individual life is that of identifying these two principles in their relation to the objective facts of Nature, so that we may be able to conform to the one and avoid the other. Duality is expressed in every department of Nature. Human intelligence recognizes the principle everywhere. In the following expressions we endeavor to clothe it in human language: 12"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NATURE'S DUALITY Finite and infinite. Time and eternity. Beginning and end- ing.

The foregoing will disclose to the careful analyst that in whatever sphere or depart- ment of Nature the principle of duality man- ifests itself, it is an expression of either simple contrast or extreme opposites. As an example, heat and cold constitute a duality which expresses a mere contrast in degrees of temperature with that of the indi- vidual. Heat merely expresses a higher dc- 14"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"NATURE'S DUALITY gree of temperature than cold. Both, how- ever, express temperature. So also, the terms large and small, fine and coarse, heavy and light, express qualities of contrast only. They represent merely a dif- ference in the degree of a single quality or property of physical Nature. On the other hand, the terms truth and falsehood constitute a duality which repre- sents two distinct and separate principles dia- metrically opposite in their essential natures. In like manner love and hate, integration and disintegration, life and death, are dual terms which express extreme opposites in Nature. As far as we are able to trace the authentic history of mankind human intelligence has intuitively sensed a great fundamental law which runs throughout all the manifestations of Nature. The application of this great law to the ethics of human life constitutes the basis of all religious and philosophic systems of the past and likewise of the present. The limitations of human intelligence in its efforts to grasp and comprehend this law in its entirety and apply it as a rule and guide 1$"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME of conduct in the daily lives of men, are re- sponsible for all the sectarianism of both religion and philosophy, as well as of all the variations in governmental systems and pol- icies throughout all the nations of earth. In its constructive aspect we recognize it as the Law of Compensation, or Compensa- tory Justice, in accordance with the Har- monics of Evolution. In its destructive aspect we recognize it as the Law of Retribution, or Retributive Jus- tice, in accordance with the Discords of Devolution. To the constructive side of this great Law of Justice is referable all that there is of in- dividual growth, development, progress, strength, health, energy, life, love and happi- ness, both here and hereafter. This is the do- main of Nature's compensatory rewards to individual intelligence for obedience to Na- ture's Evolutionary Principle. The ultimate goal of individual achieve- ment under and in accordance with the oper- ation of Nature's Constructive Principle is, so far as science knows, Individual Immor- tality and perfect Happiness, in \"the fulfill- 16"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"NATURE'S DUALITY ing of the law.\" This is the achievement which opens to the soul the \"Gates of Para- dise.\" And this is THE WAY OF LIFE. To the destructive side of this same great Law of Justice is referable all that there is of individual atrophy, weakness, enervation, sickness, suffering, sorrow, hate, fear, disease, dissolution, disintegration, decay, unhappi- ness and death. This, indeed, is the domain of Nature's Retributive Punishments to individual intel- ligence for disobedience of Nature's Evolu- tionary Principle. The law itself is a unit in essense. It mani- fests itself to human intelligence in its two- fold aspect as one of the most stupendous and comprehensive dualities of all Nature — the duality of Construction and Destruction. 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III DESTRUCTION IN OPERATION There is that in Nature which disintegrates physical matter and tears down the individ- ualized forms which have been built up through the constructive process. It destroys — not the matter itself — but the individual- ized forms into which it has been constructed, moulded and fashioned by Nature. On the basis of the results it produces, the process has been called \"Destructive,\" and the principle back of the process has been named \"The Destruc- tive Principle of Nature.\" In its effects upon the \"Individualities\" of material form, it is the exact opposite of construction. The one integrates individualities of form. The other disintegrates them. The one builds up indi- vidualities. The other tears them down. The one constructs individualities. The other de- stroys them. From this viewpoint the one is constructive and the other destructive. Let us assume that you have just completed 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME the construction of an ideally beautiful house for your home. From the beginning to the end it has been a work of construction, of in- tegration, of building and combining the ma- terials into definite individuality of form. When it is finished you look upon it as a beau- tiful individuality expressed in material form. There comes a storm. One flash of lightning, and your beautiful home is on fire. In a few short hours you see it transformed from an individualized entity called a \"house\" to a bed of ashes and a chaotic heap of debris called a \"wreck,\" a \"ruin.\" The scientific friend would console you with the assurance that \"Not an atom of the material substance of which your house was composed has been destroyed. It has sim- ply undergone a chemical transition. Fire is nothing more than a physical phenomenon which results from rapid chemical change called combustion. There is precisely the same amount of physical matter and energy in the universe there was before your house burned.

No such unscientific thought had entered his mind. He was considering only the hypo- thetical atoms of which your house was scientifically supposed to have been composed. But you are in no frame of mind to have any special interest in the mere chemistry of the subject. You have neither time nor in- clination to follow the hypothetical atoms of which your house may have been composed, through their alleged transitions in the proc- ess of combustion. The thing in which you are most vitally interested is that individual- ized entity you called your house, your home, wherein you enjoyed life, liberty and the pur- suit of happiness. That beautiful individual- ity is gone. It is no longer in existence. It is destroyed, and that very same chemical combustion about which he has been so 21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME learnedly discoursing is the process by which its destruction was accomplished. Thus it would appear that you and your scientific friend have been considering and discussing two very different subjects. You have had in mind the concrete individuality of a house, he the individual particles of ma- terial substance of which that individuality was constructed. So far as we can demonstrate, the scientist is correct when he tells us there is no suck thing as the destruction of matter. But, at the same time we know that the house, as such, was destroyed. We know that its physical individuality as a home was literally annihilated and wiped out of exist- ence. And thus, whatever may be the truth concerning the destructibility or indestructi- bility of physical matter itself, we know that the individualities into which it is integrated are destructible. The physical individuality of a tree or an animal is built up by the integrating or Con- structive Principle and Process of Nature. In time it will be torn down and disintegrated by the Destructive Principle and Process of 2t"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"DESTRUCTION IN OPERATION Nature. The same is equally true of the physical organism of man himself. As a physical individuality he is built up by Na- ture through the integrating or Constructive Process. As such, he may be torn down again through the disintegrating or Destructive Process. That vv^hich integrates and builds up the physical man is constructive in its relation to his physical individuality. That which disintegrates and tears down the physical in- dividual is destructive in its relation to that individuality. The same is equally true of the spiritual, the mental and the moral man. In other words, man has a spiritual individuality, a mental individuality, and a moral individ- uality, as well as a physical individuality. Moreover, these are all subject to the same general principles of integration and disinte- gration, construction and destruction. The mental individuality of a highly intel- ligent man or woman is as truly a result of growth as are his physical and spiritual or- ganisms. It is the result of unfoldment, in- tegration and construction.

There is also a principle in Nature which, when set in motion upon the physical plane, disintegrates our physical bodies, tears them down, destroys their individualities and re- solves them back into the elements from which they were built up. We also know that there is a principle or process which, when it becomes dominant in human life, tears down or destroys the individuality of human intelligence. With the same unerring certainty we know that there is in Nature that which, when it becomes a dominant factor in human nature, tears down, dissipates, or de- stroys the most beautiful individualities of Moral Character. As the mature mental individuality is built up and is the result of Nature's Constructive Principle and Process, so also it may be torn down and destroyed by the operation of Na- ture's Destructive Principle and Process.

We all admit the sad realities. They are the re- sults of the operation of Nature's Destructive Principle within the realm of man's moral life and nature. To disprove the existence of a Destructive Principle, is to prove that there is no such thing as a Constructive Principle of Nature. For, if it be true that the process we have all been designating as \"Destructive\" is nothing but a law of \"Infinite Change\" in operation, then it is equally true that the antithetical process which we have been calling \"Con- structive\" is also but the same law of change in operation.

In this we observe the first effects of Nature's Destructive Principle in operation. The Electro-Magnetic Life Element of the great giant is being withdrawn and death is setting his seal where life has once reigned supreme. The summers and the winters come and go. The summer sun continues to burn and the winter cold to bite. The wind's dry breath continues to blow and the rains to beat. Slowly but surely the work of desolation and destruction goes on.

The splendid oak which, under the power of Nature's Constructive Principle, operating through the Electro-Magnetic Life Element of mineral Nature and the Vito-Chemical Life Element of vegetable Nature, has grown from the tiny acorn to its full and majestic maturity, stands a veritable \"Monarch of the Forest.\" But the storm comes. The lightning flashes. The great monarch is torn from the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME earth. Its huge body lies prostrate upon the ground. Soon the green leaves begin to fade. Then they wither and fall from the branches. The corpse of the dead monarch lies bare upon the earth. Its naked body and bare limbs glisten in the sunlight. The waters come and cover it over. The soil of the earth is washed around and over it. At last, after many ages, it lies buried deep within its earthly grave. The centuries come and go. Other great trees have grown to ma- turity above it. The once mighty monarch has become a bed of coal. At last the waters recede. Man comes with his pick and shovel. The bed of coal is lifted to the earth's surface. Thence it is carried into many homes and there burned to ashes. These ashes are scattered to the four winds, and where is the once stately oak? With the lightning's stroke began the dominant play of Nature's Destructive Forces.

When the waters came and burled its great form deep down beneath the surface of the earth the chemical action of Nature's ele- ments transmuted it into the bed of coal. In this transition we note another step in the de- struction of its individuality as a tree. When man with his pick and shovel uncovered the bed of coal, lifted it to the earth's surface and carried it into many homes, this marked an- other step in the process of disintegration. Then it was consumed as fuel and converted into heat and ashes. This marked yet another step in the process of dissolution. When these ashes were scattered and lost and the heat was diffused into space the operation of Nature's Destructive Principle was com- pleted.

Its individuality on both planes of life as an or- ganic entity is destroyed. And thus is accom- plished its complete individual extinction. But what is the primary cause of this won- derful change? Only this. The organizing, integrating, developing and renewing proc- esses of vegetation depend upon the active principle of the Electro-Magnetic and Vito- Chemical Life Elements of Nature. The supply of these Life Elements has been cut oft and the process of growth has ceased. At the point where growth ceases decay in- evitably begins. The ultimate end of this De- structive Principle in Operation is complete individual extinction. Let us now go one round higher in the scale of organic Nature to the plane of the animal kingdom.

The physical lion lies prostrate in death. The process of physical dissolution imme- diately begins. The flesh is torn from the bones and devoured by other animals. Its constituent physical parts enter into the tex- ture and organic structures of many animals and plants. The bones bleach in the sun. They crumble and disintegrate.

When the hunter's bullet pierced the lion's heart the chain of vital relationship, which bound the two organisms together in one in- dividual animate entity, was broken. The two bodies immediately separated. Had he possessed the independent power of spiritual vision, the hunter might have witnessed with perfect distinctness and absolute certainty the separation of the two bodies at the moment of physical death.

But there comes a time when physical maturity is fully reached. At this point the constructive forces of the physical body be- gin to wane and the destructive forces begin to augment. This transition continues until the meridian line of physical life is reached. From this point we mark the declining years of old age. When Nature's Destructive Prin- ciple reaches its climax upon the physical plane man's physical death ensues. At this point, as in the case of the animal, the physical body and the spiritual body sepa- rate.

How^ever low down the scale of animal life we may choose to go, we fail to reach a point where this faculty or capacity appears to be wholly wanting. This would appear to es- tablish with reasonable certainty the fact that Consciousness is a primary faculty or capac- ity of the individual, animal entity. Consciousness is, indeed, that faculty or ca- pacity of the individual Intelligence, Ego, Soul or Entity, by and through which it be- comes aware of the existence of a world out- side itself as well as a world of demands within. Through this faculty or capacity the appetites, passions, desires, impulses, affec- tions, emotions, instincts and intuitions make their impression upon the individual entity and command recognition. Through this fac- 35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME ulty or capacity alone are the five physical senses able to convey their messages to the en- tity itself and have them recorded. In all the realm of animal life there appear to be such fixed limitations upon this faculty or capacity as to mark a distinct line of dif- ferentiation between the animal conscious- ness and the consciousness of man. This fact would seem to indicate that the Soul Element of Nature, which is individualized in man alone, has undoubtedly added to animal con- sciousness something which is distinctively and exclusively human in its character, de- gree or quality. To distinguish between the character, de- gree or quality of consciousness in animals and men we designate animal consciousness as simple \"consciousness\" and human con- sciousness as \"Self-Consciousness.\" Self-Consciousness is that character, de- gree or quality of consciousness which en- ables us to know and understand ourselves. It is that which enables us to perform our acts knowingly and intentionally. It involves the consciousness of the relations which exist between this self and those other selves.

As with Consciousness, so with Reason. Whatever may be said concerning the intel- ligence of animals, however closely they bor- der the realm of the human, there is a subtle dividing line, which is not easily mistaken, running between the two kingdoms of Na- ture. We recognize our intimate relationship to the animal kingdom in the appetites, pas- sions, emotions, desires, instincts and im- pulses which we experience in common with the animal. Even our motives, when judged by our actions, are often such as to suggest the animal rather than the man. But when we enter the realm of the purely psychical and ethical we at once become aware that we are in a field unoccupied by the animal, a field which appears to be re- served to man alone.

This is not intended to deny nor in the least degree minimize the intelligence of ani- mals. It will be conceded by every intelli- gent student of natural history that the ani- mal displays many unmistakable evidences of a nascent or dawning intelligence. A careful investigation and study of these evidences, however, would seem to establish certain fixed and definite limitations within which the operations of animal intelligence are cir- cumscribed. To a considerable extent, indeed, the ani- mal intelligence appears to operate as a nat- ural reflex of the purely physical motives of animal Nature. It is, to all appearances, concerned with an exclusive interest in its physical life and environment. The struggle for nutrition, for individual life, for self-pro- tection, for the gratification of the purely physical appetites, passions, affections, emo- tions and desires, the instinct of reproduc- tion, the mother's care of her young, all com- bine to make up the little world within which St"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITY animal intelligence finds the limits of its achievements. But not so in the larger domain of human intelligence. Here we have most clearly de- fined those higher, sustained activities of the analytic and synthetic mind which we desig- nate as \"Reason.\" This power of inductive and deductive reasoning which appears to be almost, if not entirely, wanting in the animal, rises in man to a development apparently without fixed limitations. Man reasons analytically, syn- thetically, inductively and deductively on all the affairs of his own life as well as on the lives of his fellow-men. He reasons upon his physical body, his appetites, passions, im- pulses, desires and functions. He reasons upon this life and the life to come. He rea- sons upon the Soul. He reasons upon what he is, what he has been, and what he may yet become. He reasons upon himself as an in- dividual intelligence and as a part of the great aggregate of Universal Intelligence. He reasons upon things finite and things which appear to him to be infinite. He rea- sons upon God and Nature, finite intelligence 39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME and infinite intelligence. He reasons upon reason itself, and in all his reasoning he is seldom content to stop short of the ultimate. It is upon this power of reason that he de- pends to guard himself from the errors, mis- takes and accidents of life. This is the power which enables him to anticipate the natural and logical results of his own actions. Reason, in truth, is another of the primary, fundamental and essential elements of human character at the basis of individual respon- sibility. A further study and comparison of ani- mals and men discovers another marked dis- tinction between them in the power of inde- pendent Choice. The distinction here, as in the case of consciousness and reason, is un- doubtedly of a psychic nature and referable to the Soul Element of Nature, which is in- dividualized in man alone. The power of individual choice in the ani- mal is so nearly a reflex of the physical appe- tites, passions, affections, emotions, desires and instincts that it apparently loses the ele- ment of independence to a very large extent.

But a careful analysis of the act and its motive seems to establish a natural concurrence of whatever reason is manifested, with the physical and spiritual demands above enumerated. The moral element appears to be wanting in the motives which govern animal life and action. In man this power of independent choice rises to the highest level of his ethical nature. To the extent only that man may, in truth, be said to be a creature of environment would his power of individual choice appear to lack the element of independence. However much we may endeavor to ex- cuse ourselves from the natural penalties of our own mistakes, derelictions and transgres- sions upon the theory that we are but \"crea- tures of circumstances,\" we know that our fellow men almost unanimously deal with us upon the assumption that we really do pos- sess the power of independent choice.

An independent, self-conscious and ration- al act is never performed without an impulse of the Will to set in motion the processes by and through which the act is to be accom- plished. This impulse of the Will we call ''Volition.\" This power of volition is possessed by ani- mals as well as by men. But here again we find a distinct line of differentiation mani- fest. The animal volition responds in what appears to be a semi-automatic manner to the animal impulses. It is apparently little more than a reflex of the animal appetities, passions, affections, emotions, desires and instincts. 42"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITY To a marked degree, therefore, it lacks in one or more of the elements of Independence, Self-Consciousness and Reason. To the same degree it lacks the moral elements at the foundation of Individual Responsibility. Man in his normal physical and mental state of being possesses the power to act in- dependently. This means that he is able to act unaided and uninfluenced by his fellow men. He also possesses the power to act self-con- sciously. This means that he is able to act knowingly and intentionally.

The unqualified truth of this statement will become perfectly apparent to every in- telligent thinker who will take the trouble to familiarize himself with the fundamental principles underlying the criminal jurispru- dence of our country. Upon this subject the ablest minds of all the ages have been em- ployed in an effort to work out a system or standard by which to try and determine the motives and the actions of men with perfect equity, justice and right. From the \"indictment,\" which is the first legal document containing the criminal charges, through all the evidence, the testi- mony of witnesses, the objections of counsel, the rulings of the court, the charge to the jury, the finding of the verdict and the final judgment of the court upon the verdict, there is but one general purpose. That purpose is to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. The first thing to be determined is whether the act charged in the indictment was ac- 44"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE INDIVIDUAL ENTITY tually committed. If this be proved, the sec- ond step is to determine whether the accused is the person who committed the act so charged. If this also be proved, then the third step is to determine whether he did it of his own volition. If it can be shown that he committed the act charged, and did it voluntarily, then the inquiry is narrowed to three simple questions: Even though he committed the act charged and did it of his own volition, did he act en- tirely independently? In other words, was he aided or influenced by any one else? If so, by whom and to what extent? Did he commit the act entirely self-con- sciously? That is to say, did he act know- ingly and intentionally? Was he in the full possession of his reason at the time the act was committed? Or was the act his own rational act? This means, was he at the time able to anticipate the logi- cal and natural results of his act? If all these conditions can be shown to have existed at the time the act was com- mitted, then the jury has nothing to do but return a verdict of \"Guilty as charged in the 4S"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME 'ndictment\" (unless the element of self-de- fense enters into the case) and the accused must suffer the full penalty of the law. But if it can be shown that he did not act independently, then it is the business of the court and jury to ascertain to what extent he was aided or influenced by others, and by whom. In just so far as it can be determined that he was aided or influenced by others to commit the act, to that extent it is the intent of the law to condone the offense. To that extent also he is relieved of responsibility. To the same extent the responsibility for his act is fixed upon those who are found to have aided or influenced him to commit it, and it becomes the duty of the court to see that they are adequately punished, if this be possible. Again, if it can be shown that at the time of the commission of the act complained of he was not entirely self-conscious; in other words, if in any measure the act was com- mitted without knowledge or intent on his part, then it is necessary and proper to as- certain to what extent this was the case.

In the verdict of the jury and the final judgment of the court upon the verdict and in the sentence pronounced by the court the effort will be made to give him the benefit to whatever ex- tent he is found to be not responsible. And finally, the question of his sanity must be determined. If it can be shown that at the time of the commission of the act he was not in full possession of his reason, it becomes the duty of the court and jury to ascertain to what extent he was unable to exercise his ra- tional faculties, capacities and powers. To what extent was he at the time unable to ra- tionally anticipate the logical and natural re- sults of his act? When this question is deter- mined it is the intent of the law to condone the offense to a degree commensurate with his lack of rational understanding. In just so far as it can be determined that he was, at the time of the commission of the act, not in possession of all his rational facul- ties, capacities and powers, to that extent he is relieved from responsibility for the act so committed. To that extent he is held to be 47"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME excused from the consequences of his act, and to the same extent his sentence will be miti- gated.

Thus it is found, and universally admit- ted, that the primary, fundamental and essen- tial elements of individual responsibility are: 1. Self-Consciousness. 2. Independent Choice. 3. Reason. 4.

It would seem that the process is one which is in some respects analogous to that of freezing. It does not produce internal heat. It is not \"consuming\" in its nature. It is sim- ply paralyzing.

The extreme forms and degrees, such as Rage, Fury, Hate, Wrath, and Revenge, are intensely destructive in their psychological effects upon the individual who harbors them.

Their action is not only intensely destructive, but also very rapid. Oftentimes they result in the most serious illness, always in great depletion, and many times in instant death.

And they destroy not only the physical body, but the Soul itself of him who harbors them. Pettishness, Irritation, Bitterness, Resent- ment, Impatience and 111 Temper are the more common forms and degrees. These we meet at every turn in the daily affairs of life.

On the side of Fear it often takes the phase of Suspicion, Apprehension, and Distrust, while on the side of Anger it ex- presses itself as Hate, Wrath or Revenge. A husband regards the love of his wife as his own. He observes her unusual interest in another man. If he is like the very large majority of his fellows, a sense of apprehen- sion, uncertainty, anxiety, or suspicion (all of which are phases of Fear), takes possession of him.

It is the immediate basis of a very large percent- age of all human misery.

It is pro- foundly destructive in its effects upon him or her who harbors it. Moreover, it is both sci- entifically unnecessary and morally wrong. Self-Pity is based upon the assumption that the world, or Nature, or the Great Intelli- gence back of these, has dealt with us cruelly and unjustly. Out of this assumption grows, very naturally, too, the conviction that we are aggrieved and injured parties. Oftentimes our grievance, or assumed grievance, resolves itself into a definite conviction that we justly and rightly deserve vastly more than we now 59"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOIX)GICAL CRIME possess or have ever received from God, or Nature, or our fellow man. And thus, without the slightest attempt on our part to justify such an assumption by a schedule of \"deserts\" on the one hand and \"possessions\" on the other, we jump to the conclusion that the ledger of life shows a large balance due us which has never been paid. On the basis of this imaginary balance we forthwith develop within us a condition of mental or psychological acidity which has the effect to sour everything sweet within us, and curdle the \"milk of human kindness\" outside of us and within the radius of our influence. There are within the confines of human society both men and women who might well and truly be designated as \"Constitutional Martyrs.\" We have all seen them. They are a distinct type. These are they who are for- ever playing the role of Martyr. They are martyrs in the home. They are martyrs in society. They are martyrs to duty. They are martyrs to their religion. They are, in truth, martyrs all the time, everywhere and to every- 60"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"SELF-PITY thing with which they find it possible to iden- tify themselves. Individuals of this type, whether men or women, are never quite so nearly happy as when they are utterly miserable, or can make others think they are miserable. About the only comfort they seem to enjoy is that which they extract from the enervating emotion of Self-Pity. Their principal occupation is that of endeavoring to make the rest of mankind as miserable as they pretend to be. Like a pestilence, they carry misery and sorrow and the shadow of death wherever their influence radiates. They poison every atmosphere into which they come. The amount of misery and unhappiness which just one such individual is able to generate and diffuse in a given time is something truly won- derful. If it were not for the fact that joy and life and happiness are as truly contagious as misery, there are enough men and women of the type referred to, in society, to make of this a sorry old world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the greater part of Self-Pity in the world has for its basis no loftier desire than that of Material 61"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME Greed. And the Self-Pity that is akin to Greed is the kind of self-commiseration we indulge when we are denied material things we are forced to see others enjoy. No more degrading emotion can rend the Soul than that character of Self-Pity which is at once the hankerings of Greed and the pangs of Envy. Over the Self-Pity that flows from defeated Ambitions and unsatisfied Vanities neither men nor \"angels'' can be expected to waste great sympathy. For the mere craving to excel, in the ordinary activities and arts of the world, is not of itself a very exalted desire nor a very ennobling impulse. If one were to desire \"exaltation\" only in accordance with the merit of his purpose, or his real capaci- ties, or his worthy industry, and if his defeat were a matter of exterior circumstances, then would he be entitled to a just measure of sym- pathy. But even in this case Self-Pity would only weaken his real powers and chill fresh impulses and fresh endeavors for future success. For the Self-Pity that flows from loneli- ness, from lack of appreciation, from per- 62"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"SELF-PITY sonal deformities, from unjust condemnation or from unrequited love, we should have a just measure of genuine sympathy. The im- pulses that lie back of these sorrows are nat- ural. They have their rise in the higher na- ture of the individual and represent the loftier demands of the Soul. Such as these should not be condemned that they long for compan- ionship, for appreciation, for personal attrac- tiveness, for justice, nor for the happiness of an exclusive love relation. Their error lies in the weak surrender to these emotions and a surrender of self to the kind of sorrow that stands in the pathway of fresh opportuni- ties and happier future possibilities. There is no form of Self-Pity, nor is there any character of \"cause\" that can sanction or justify or sanctify that which weakens, de- feats and destroys the Soul of man. All men and women desire to be loved, and it is the hope of this realization that inspires us all in the Struggle for Happiness both here and in the realms of spiritual life beyond. Many of us, as yet, are denied the love for which the Soul hungers and thirsts. As yet, we are unable to command it, to win it, to find 63"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME it, or to realize it. Because of this the Soul turns back upon itself in disappointment and the heart grows sick with \"hope deferred.\" If the weakness of Self-Pity were ever jus- tifiable surely it should be under circum- stances of this character. Self-Pity softens and weakens and lets down the barriers to all deadly psychological microbes. Self-Pity may well be defined as \"Psycho- logical Phthisis.\" This means psychological tuberculosis, or consumption. It may not be a \"germ disease,\" but it manifests, in a psychic sense, all the evidences of a self-consuming process. It slowly but surely eats away at the vitals of the Soul itself until all that sustains health, strength, vitality, courage, hope and happiness is consumed. Health fails, strength departs, vitality is consumed, courage goes, hope fades and happiness is impossible. All that gives to life its meaning and its inspira- tion is thus consumed. And this is truly \"Psychological Consumption.\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII GREED Any consideration of the subject of our \"possessions\" suggests a natural \"companion piece\" for Self-Pity. This we recognize through all its many disguises as Greed for Material Things. While the one might well be classed as an error of negation, the other is assuredly well defined as a crime of aggression. Both, how- ever, belong to the Destructive Process and are fairly well balanced in their effects upon the individual man or woman who indulges them. Greed, like Self-Pity, grows out of a mis- understanding as to our \"just deserts\" under natural law, and a misconception of the real meaning of the term \"possessions.\" Greed is the inordinate and insatiable thirst for material possessions regardless of the merit or the earning capacity of the greedy one. 65"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME Self-Pity is weak. Greed is strong. While one laments its \"poverty,\" the other goes forth into the world to wrest from Nature or his fellow man that which his greed demands. Self-Pity weeps. Greed demands. Self- Pity is timid, introspective and inert. Greed is cunning, active and alert. Self-Pity is an emotion and an indulgence of the imagina- tion. Greed is a passion and an over-stimula- tion of Selfishness. To those who independently and at Will are able to view the conditions of life beyond the incident we call physical death, there are few sadder spectacles than that of the \"earth- bound\" Soul seeking to regain its lost phys- ical \"possessions.\" The miser whose physical life has been spent in the accumulation of material wealth, finds nothing in spiritual life to attract him. His Soul hovers about the vaults of earth where his physical treasures lie buried. He cannot leave them. Day after day, month after month, and year after year he wanders amid the familiar scenes of his earth life with his Soul set upon the task of regaining his lost possessions. But they forever elude him. They bind him, and yet 66"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"GREED he cannot reach them. He realizes that oth- ers must find them and use them and scatter them to the four winds. And when at last his treasure is discovered he protests in vain. No one can hear his cry of anguish.

Specific instances are known wherein not only years but centuries have been spent in this hopeless struggle after material \"Things\" of the physical plane. There are thousands of men and women to- day who are unwittingly binding the chains of material slavery upon their Souls by their greed for and absorption in the purely ma- terial \"Things\" of earth. It may be the things that beautify and adorn the physical body, such as jewels and fine clothes; or it may be material wealth such as mortgages, stocks, bonds and currency, and the things which these will buy.

We unconsciously recognize the truth of this by the manner in w^hich we ver- bally express our emotions. It is perfectly natural as well as accurate to say, \"I feel an- gry.\" \"I feel sorry.\" \"I feel glad.\" \"I feel a sense of fear or dread,\" etc. That is to say, we feel all these various emo- tions. They translate themselves to our intel- ligence as feeling and not as intellection. Thus it is that the emotional nature of man is within the realm of individual feeling. 69"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME Emotionalism is therefore confined entirely to the sensuous plane of individual life. The indulgence of Religious Emotional- ism, beyond its legitimate function, is quite as destructive of Individual Intelligence as Self-Indulgence of any of the many appetites or passions which lure men and women into the Pathway of Destruction. But Religion and Religious Emotions have reference to elements and aspects of human nature wholly above and beyond the level of all that we des- ignate as unmoral in the animal kingdom. It may be said with equal truth that emo- tionalism of any and every character, if in- dulged beyond the point of ^'Temperance,\" becomes destructive. Emotionalism is upon a plane entirely dis- tinct from that of the purely intellectual or rational processes. We feel things whether we will or not. Our emotional natures act quite independently of our intelligence or reason. It is true that after an emotion has been excited or set in motion we may by the exercise of Will con- trol it, but the exciting cause is entirely in- voluntary. When an emotion has been once 70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"EMOTIONALISM brought into existence it is then a contest be- tween it and the intelligent Will of the indi- vidual for supremacy. If the Will succeeds in controlling the emotion the intelligence maintains its positive status or condition. If the emotion controls the Will the intelligence thereby falls into a negative or passive state. The extent to which our emotions control us at any given time determines the measure to which they produce in us a psychically nega- tive or passive condition. Let us suppose that a mother is informed of the death of her child. Instantly the emo- tion of deepest sorrow takes possession of her. If she but yield to its power it will overcome and completely master her. If she exercise her power of Will upon it, she may control its violence and ultimately master it. In this instance it is clear that the excitant or cause of her emotion is wholly involuntary on her part. The emotion of sorrow takes possession of her without even so much as consulting her Intelligence, Will or Desire. But after it has come into active existence within her emotional nature, it is then possi- ble for her to apply to it the power of her 71"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME Will and Intelligence and thus control it. On the other hand, she may fail or refuse to exer- cise her Will upon it, in which event the emotion will completely master her. We have all seen both men and women in the midst of deepest sorrow and affliction who, by the intelligent exercise of the power of Will alone, have passed through the trying ordeal with a self-control which never fails to command our unlimited admiration and re- spect. In the latter case the individual controls his emotions; in the former he is controlled by them. It is now possible to understand that while an emotion is the result of an active state of feeling, it does not necessarily mean an active state of intelligence. Indeed, it is possible to understand that it may involve an inactive or passive condition of the mind or intelligence. This is suggested by the well-known fact that animals experience all the simple emotions common to mankind. It is a fact known to science and fully rec- ognized by the world in general, that among all the different races the negro represents the 72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"EMOTIONALISM most emotional type of human nature. His life, habits, customs and character all com- bine to express emotional feeling. He lives almost entirely upon the plane of the senses. Naturally, therefore, the negro in his native element is the intellectual infant of humanity. Nothing more peculiarly illustrates these predominating characteristics of the race than the old-fashioned negro revival. They throw themselves into these services v^ith an emotional abandon w^hich carries everything before it. They appear to fairly revel in the sensuous pleasure it affords them. Their re- ligion is to them very largely a matter of feel- ing. Even the music which best expresses their character and state of being has a rhythm and a swing which act as a powerful emotional excitant. The ruling characteristic of the negro is emotionalism. He has never tried to control it. It is everywhere and at all times at the very surface of his nature and ready to de- mand expression. For this reason the negro finds it not only easy but perfectly natural to fall into a state of emotional subjectivity. An hour of religious emotionalism is sufficient 73"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME to carry an entire negro camp meeting to the verge of hysteria, if not to a state of complete trance. It is found that the animal which has not yet risen to the plane of intellectuality is nev- ertheless an intensely emotional being. He lives entirely upon the plane of the senses. In his emotional nature he approaches very closely the level of human nature. He expe- riences with intensity the emotions of jeal- ousy, affection, anger, fear, joy, and sorrow, and he gives instant and unrestrained expres- sion to his emotional nature only because he does not possess the power of reason. There is never a time when men and women so much resemble the animal as when they give unrestrained expression to ultra emo- tionalism. Why? Because then it is that they manifest the least reason and the most feeling. In proportion as an individual lives upon the plane of his sensuous nature he gives expres- sion to his animal nature. In proportion as he lives upon the plane of his intelligence he manifests his distinctively human nature. It is therefore a fact of Nature that unre- strained emotionalism tends toward animal- 74"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"EMOTIONALISM ism. This is a scientific fact from which there is no escape. It is a frequent occurrence in medical prac- tice to find an individual in a state of hysteria as the result of unrestrained or uncontrolled emotions. It may be the result of sorrow, or anger, or fear, or excessive joy. It matters not what the particular emotion may be, whether of the most exalting or the most de- basing character, if the individual but yield to its influence it will ultimately control every faculty, capacity and power of the Soul, in- cluding the Power of Will. In its final analysis Emotionalism is the re- sult of sensuous activity and intellectual pas- sivity. The intensity of the emotion measures the degree of sensuous activity. In propor- tion as the sensuous activity increases the in- telligence becomes passive. In proportion as we permit our emotions to control us we thereby surrender the power of Self-Control. In proportion as we control our emotions we preserve intact the power of Self-Control.

Why is this so? We do not know, any more than we know why opium produces coma.

If it were possible for the vain, the selfish and the mean, in the spirit of vanity, selfish- ness and meanness, to achieve Spiritual Inde- pendence and Mastership, that fact of itself would constitute a complete justification of vanity, selfishness and meanness in human life and conduct. If it were possible for the subtle trickster, the clever pretender, the vain boaster, and the morally degenerate to skulk past the Law of Compensation into the King- dom of Spiritual Light, then would Nature 78"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"SELFISHNESS not only condone trickery, pretense, vanity and immorality, but would become a party to them. If this were possible, then also would there be no meaning in honesty, sincerity, hu- mility and morality. For if Nature made no distinction why should man? If Nature pro- vided obscure bypaths whereby the vicious and the cunning might slip past the Law of Spiritual Unfoldment and, through a dark subterranean passage and a secret panel, reach the guest chamber of the Temple of Spiritual Light from the rear, such a provision would constitute \"Class Legislation\" of the most vicious and degrading character in favor of immorality and wickedness in human nature. In this event Nature, or the Great Universal Intelligence that expresses itself to man through Nature, would stand condemned as a party to fraud, injustice, dishonesty and vice in all its hideous deformity. In the legislature of Nature there is no such thing as class legislation. Intellectual Vanity begets the desire for \"leadership\" and public applause.

Material wealth, therefore, is one of the potential elements which enable vain men to gratify their vanity. This fact stimulates the spirit of greed. It is for this reason that Vanity and Greed go hand in hand as concomitant factors throughout all human society. But it is the spirit of greed, the inordinate and selfish desire for material wealth wherewith to buy the applause of the masses, that impels vain and ambitious men to resort to trickery, fraud, dishonesty and immoral practices. Hence it is that Vanity, impelled by Selfishness, leads first to Greed and thence to Dishonesty and Immorality. Vanity, Greed, Dishonesty, Immorality. That tells the story in all its simplicity. The very essense of it all is Selfishness. And Selfishness is \"Psychological Paralysis.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI VANITY There are two kinds of Vanity: Vanity of Person. Vanity of Intelligence. Personal Vanity is self-admiration of per- sonal appearance. It is undue admiration of one's own form, figure, face, dress, decora- tion, ornamentation, personal possessions and material belongings. It stimulates in us the craving desire for the admiration, the homage and the applause of others as to our personal appearance. Intellectual Vanity is unjustifiable admira- tion of one's own intelligence or intellectual attainments. It impels us to seek the admira- tion and the applause of others as to our in- tellectual brilliancy, wit, humor, knowledge, judgment and intellectual superiority over others. Vanity, like both Fear and Anger, expresses itself in many different forms and phases;"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME Self-cpnsciousness, Self-conceit, Self-confidence, Self-esteem, Self-praise, Self-gratulation, Self-glorification, Self-assurance, Self-complacency, Self-sufficiency, Self-approbation, Self-admiration, Self-applause, Self-love, Self-elation, Egotism. It expresses itself outwardly by: Arrogance, Boastfulness, Haughtiness, Superciliousness, Disdain, Imperiousness, Ostentation, Pretentiousness, Arbitrariness, Dogmatism, Flippancy, Audacity, Impertinence, Frivolity. As between the sexes, it would seem that Personal Vanity, or Vanity of Person, is a weakness more common to women than to men; while Intellectual Vanity is, without question, one of man's most conspicuous faults and most glaring defects of character. The vanities of women manifest themselves more conspicuously in their love of dress, jewelry, decoration, and the effort, through the art of self-adornment, to command atten- 82"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"VANITY tion and applause for their personal beauty and apparent loveliness. The vain woman is more likely to betray her weakness through evidences of self-consciousness in all of its many subtle forms, through haughtiness, im- periousness, disdain, ostentation, flippancy, self-assurance, self-praise and self-conceit. The vanities of men betray themselves most frequently through marked evidences of self- confidence, boastfulness, arrogance, egotism, self-sufficiency, arbitrariness and dogmatism. Of course there are many exceptions among both the sexes. There are women who are consumed with Intellectual Vanity, and there are men who are equally devoured by Per- sonal Vanity; but these would appear to be the exceptions rather than the rule. From a psychological standpoint Vanity in all its forms and phases is destructive. The vanities of men are no less so than those of women. In many respects they are even more to be deplored. The ambition for power, so common among men, is impelled by their desire for public applause. The struggle for political and so- cial leadership is but a struggle that is im-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME pelled by Vanity. The impulse back of it all is the love of approbation and the insatiate desire for personal admiration and public applause. The selfish desire for personal glorification is back of most of the ambitious men. Vanity, in all its manifold forms and phases, is an expression of the most inordinate selfishness. It is an impulse of self-gratifica- tion without regard of any kind whatsoever for the well-being of others. There is, perhaps, no single trait of human character which more clearly and surely be- trays the charlatan and the faker than that form of Vanity which impels men to the struggle for leadership and power. The badge of the charlatan is Intellectual Vanity. There is yet another form of Intellectual Vanity among men that deserves special at- tention and consideration. It is that which betrays itself in Dogmatism and Arbitrari- ness of both speech and manner. The arbitrary man is forever getting him- self into awkward and humiliating situations. He generally talks volubly, if not learnedly, upon subjects with which he is but indifTer- t4"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"VANITY ently acquainted. He makes many statements and assertions which he finds it impossible to support by either facts, logic or reason. He depends upon an arbitrary assertiveness and dogmatic emphasis to silence those who are inclined to question his statements. Many times this fails to work, for he finds that there are many other men just as arbitrary and dog- matic as he, and some of them often know much more concerning the facts than he does. Such as these do not hesitate to join issue with him. And when they defeat him, show his ignorance and his error, and drive him into a corner, he seldom has the manly grace to acknowledge his defeat or admit his error. It is a rare thing to find an intellectually vain man who can or will listen with patience to those who do not agree with him. It is an equally rare thing to find one who will grace- fully admit an error when it is pointed out to him. For this reason such men make poor students. They are so intent upon impress- ing their knowledge, or assumed knowledge, or beliefs upon others that all the receiving avenues of the Soul are closed. They cannot 85"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME take in that which others have to give. The receptive element of character is wanting. Another inevitable result of Intellectual Vanity among men is the natural tendency to intellectual combat. It is impossible for men of this type to meet for the mutual considera- tion of important problems, whether social, economic, scientific, political, ethical, educa- tional, philosophical or religious, without dropping at once to the level of disputation, debate, controversy and intellectual battle. It is impossible for men of this type to listen to each other's views patiently, calmly, re- spectfully, and with the gracious attitude of Soul which makes the transmission of knowl- edge possible. The spirit of reciprocity is entirely wanting. Among such men there is no such thing possible as mutual intellectual exchange. The mental attitude is that of in- tellectual thrust and parry, stroke and guard, until one or the other is either helpless or driven from the field of combat. Even then the spirit of hostility is not conquered. It proceeds at once to prepare for further con- flict, in the hope of retrieving lost honors. 9i"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"VANITY And thus the irrepressible conflict continues until physical death closes the struggle. ^Tride is: 1. ^'Unreasonable conceit of one's own su- periority, whether as to talents, wealth, beauty, accomplishment, rank, office, or other distinction, with correspondingly contemptu- ous feeling toward others.\" 2. \"The manifestation of this feeling in one's intercourse with others, as by haughti- ness, arrogance, or superciliousness.\" 3. \"A proper sense of personal dignity, character and worth; self-respect,\" etc. Its synonyms are: \"Conceit, ostentation, self-complacency, self-conceit, self-esteem, self-exaltation, self-respect, vainglory, and vanity.\" The first and second definitions given fall clearly within the field of Vanity, while the third is with equal exactness within the field of Self-respect. The following analysis is to be found in the Standard Dictionary: ''Conceit and Vanity are associated with weakness. Pride with strength. Conceit may be founded upon nothing; Pride is founded upon something that one is, or has, or has 87"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME done; Vanity, too, is commonly founded on something real, though far slighter than would afford foundation for Pride.

Self-conceit is ridiculous; Conceit is offensive.

For this reason, if the term is ever used to express a condition of Soul or state of being that is within Construc- tive limitations, it should always be preceded by the adjectives \"just,\" or \"worthy,\" or some other qualifying explanation that would indi- cate clearly and unmistakably the specific sense in which it is employed.

The intellectual battle of the ages was that which grew out of the dogmatic interpretations of Scripture. It continued for many centuries without abating, and in a somewhat milder form the controversy has come down even to the present time. The \"Doctrines\" and \"Dogmas\" of the va- rious Christian denominations are entirely due to the interpretations of men.

Theological dogmatism, as truly as other brands of dogmatism, is the result of Intel- lectual Vanity, and not of Piety, as many appear to believe.

As the term is gen- erally employed, it has reference more espe- cially to indulgence of the propensities, ap- petites, passions and desires. The appetites, passions, desires and emo- tions of man are as necessary to his existence (especially so long as he remains upon the plane of physical nature), as are the elements which enter into the other sides of his life and nature. Its natural functions are there- fore not only legitimate and proper, but they are necessary and should be respected. But the man or woman who becomes a slave to them to the exclusion of the care and the health of the Soul, soon sinks to a level of Morality below that of the animal. This is the result which must inevitably come to those who fall into the habit of Self-In- 91"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME dulgence of the appetites, passions, emotions and desires of their natures. But Self-indulgence is by no means lim- ited to the field of the animal nature. It not only may, but often does, extend to all the departments of human nature, the Soul as well as the Body. It is as easy for some men to indulge the tendency to Impatience or Irri- tability, or other phases of Anger, as it is for others to indulge the physical appetites and passions. The one is just as destructive as the other. There are, perhaps, as many wo- men who indulge themselves in the habit of Anxiety, Despondency, Suspicion, or Dread, as there are who fall victims of their grosser natures. The indulgence of any phase of Fear is as truly and as intensely destructive as the indulgence of the purely physical ap- petites and passions. Much of man's intelligent effort in all ages has been spent in an attempt either to justify or excuse himself for yielding to all the evil appetites, passions, emotions, impulses, de- sires and tendencies of his nature. Because these tendencies are a part of his natural in- heritance they are therefore \"natural,\" and 92"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"SELF-INDULGENCE he seeks to acquit himself for their indul- gence because of his profound respect for the \"established institutions of nature.\" Ingen- ious man, clever trickster that he is, has thus invented the fascinating philosophy (more accurately sophistry) of Self-Indulgence. Humiliating as the fact must be to every honest and aspiring soul, nevertheless it is true that men, bright and intelligent men, too, have labored long and wilfully and deter- minedly to formulate and promulgate philos- ophies and religions that will justify them in the indulgence of all the baser impulses and desires of gross human nature. In some in- stances they have invented the most unique and subtle devices of thought in order that they may look with complacency upon their own weaknesses, shortcomings, moral laxities, evil tendencies and degrading self-indul- gences. A certain business man of large brain, clever intelligence, strong physical nature and abbreviated conscience, spent some years and much energy and thought in the formulation of a philosophy of life that would justify him in doing as he pleased, rather than as he 93"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME should. The fundamental tenet of his philos- ophy was based upon the evolutionary princi- ple. It was exceedingly enticing (to those of his kind) and brought him results in great abundance. His formulary was something after this fashion: \"Individual evolution is the result of Ex- perience. Experience, therefore, is the one thing which Nature has in mind as the basis of the evolutionary process. The purpose of life, therefore, is to 'get experience.' In order that the Soul may graduate from earth's evolutionary school, it must have had all the experiences possible to any Soul. This earth life is but the primary grade in the evolutionary school of nature. It is, there- fore, not only the legitimate business, but the specific duty of every individual to get out of this physical life all the experience possible to physical nature.\" On the basis of this unique formulary he was able to present an ingenious excuse for all his conduct, however immoral, dishonest, wicked or criminal it might be. It was neces- sary to his evolutionary development and self- completion that he have \"all experiences,\""},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"SELF-INDULGENCE and in all his self-indulgences, however wick- ed, immoral and degrading, he was simply \"getting experience.\" He was merely \"evolv- ing\" to something higher and better. His philosophy worked all right for a time, and the rapidity of his \"evolution\" was some- thing Darwin had never dreamed of. But he was evidently too far ahead of the age in which he lived. If not, then the legislature of his state was too slow in accommodating itself to his philosophy by repealing all the statutes against crime, and as a result one of his un- evolved victims landed him in jail, where he had \"more experience.\" Every individual who has arrived at the age of discretion knows how broad and smooth and seductive is the road that leads to self-surrender, self-indulgence and self-de- struction. He knows that it is the way which leads downward to the valley of Darkness, Desolation and Devolution. Self-indulgence is ^'Psychological Sui- cide,\" 95"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIII THE MAGNETIC ELEMENT Man is a triune being. He is composed of a physical body, a spiritual body, and a Soul. The physical body is that part of man con- cerning which most men are best informed. Many do not know that they have a spiritual body, and a good many others are in grave doubt as to whether there is such a thing as a Soul. This, however, does not alter the facts. The physical body is composed of physical material. The spiritual body is composed of spiritual matter. The Soul is the intelligent entity which operates both bodies. What it is in essence we do not know. All we know of it are its manifestations. We know that it manifests itself through its material bodies. Whether or not it also is \"material\" we do not know. One body is composed of physical mate- rial, coarse in particle and slow in vibratory activity. The other is composed of spiritual 97"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME material, fine in particle and rapid in vibra- tory activity. These two material bodies occupy the same material area or volume, though not absolutely the same \"space,\" as this term is used by physical science.

A more fitting illustration, perhaps, would be suggested by the manner in which water and sand interpenetrate when placed in the same vessel. The water, being finer of particle than sand, runs into the interstices between the particles of the sand. Owing entirely to this difference in the degree of fineness of their particles, a cup full of sand will also hold at the same time a considerable quantity of water. After many centuries of experimentation the Great School of the Masters has demon- strated, with what would appear to be abso- lute scientific certainty, that there are an Electro-Magnetic Life Element and a Vito- Chemical Life Element of Nature, both of which interpenetrate the two material bodies of man during his physical life.

It is finer of particle than what we know as physical matter, and not so fine as spiritual matter. It has been proven with scientific certainty that this Magnetic Ele- ment within man's individual composition is subject to the control of his individual Will. Every physically embodied Soul has two material bodies, a physical body and a spir- itual body.

Spiritual Magnetism has an equally strong attraction for the spiritual body. Physical Magnetism and Spiritual Mag- netism have a strong attraction for each other. Here is a distinct threefold magnetic at- traction in peculiar combination. Study it a moment. A simple experiment with four physical magnets will furnish us an illustration which will help those who may not be familiar with the subject to understand what occurs at the point of physical death. Take four magnetic bars (Fig. 1) so mag- netically related that when lying side by side No. 1 and No. 2 are strongly attracted to each other; No. 3 and No. 4 are equally attracted to each other; and No. 2 and No. 3 are like- wise attracted to each other.

Hypnotist. — A person in the physical body who voluntarily controls the Will, vol- untary powers and sensory organism of an- other physically embodied person. This definition has reference to a cer- tain relation existing between physically em- bodied persons only; that is, between phys- ical beings. Attention is called to this partic- ular limitation, for the reason that upon it depends an important distinction between a \"hypnotist\" and a \"spiritual control.\" A hypnotist controls the Will (as well as the voluntary powers and sensory organism) of his subject during the continuance of the hypnotic process. Within the meaning of the definition hyp- 106"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"TERMS DEFINED notism involves a relationship between at least tv^o persons.

Special attention is called to the distinction here made between a control and a hypnotist. The hypnotist is in the physical body while the control is in the spiritual body only. The one is a physical being while the other is a spiritual being. The hypnotist operates from the plane of the earth while the control oper- ates from the spiritual plane.

Medium: A physically embodied person whose Will, voluntary powers and sensory or- ganism are subject to the Will or domination of a spiritual control.

Hypnotism. — The process by and through which a hypnotist obtains, holds and exer- cises control of the Will, voluntary powers and sensory organism of his subject. Also the psychic relation which exists between the two parties during the continuance of the hypnotic process.

Spiritualism : That particular school, cult, religion, philosophy or metaphysical system which is founded upon its acceptance of mediumship as a legitimate and proper method and process by and through which to establish and maintain personal communica- tion between those in the spiritual life and those in the physical. Attention is called to the sharply defined limitations of the last two definitions.

Such as these are not here classed as \"Spiritualists.\" Neither is any philosophy, science or re- ligion which condemns mediumship called \"Spiritualism.\" Spiritual Organism: The spiritual body of an individual, with all its various organs and organic parts, by and through which the intelligent Soul manifests itself upon the spiritual planes of life.

It is the central organic instrument by and through which the individual intelligence re- ceives impressions from the outside world of physical nature.

For the purpose of this work these three distinct parts or general divisions constitute three dis- tinct and separate brains which, according to scientific nomenclature, are designated as follows: Medulla Oblongata.

For the sake of easy reference the three brains will be hereinafter designated in the order above mentioned, as the primary, sec- ondary and third brains, the Medulla being designated as the primary, the Cerebellum as the secondary and the Cerebrum as the third brain.

The intelligence manifested through such a brain is of the lowest type and the most lim- ited in its scope and operation. It seems to be confined almost entirely to the one line of activity which has to do with the struggle for nutrition. Even here in this narrowly limited field of operation, it seems to be little more than a reflex of the purely physical demand for food. It seeks its nourishment with little more evidence of an individualized intelli- gence than is manifest in the sunflower when it turns its face to the sunlight. It seems to operate almost as an automatic instrument under the control of natural law, as if it were so impelled by the great Universal Intelli- gence which lies back of all life.

In the development of hypnotism, where the sittings arc frequent and persistent, a point is soon reached where all of Nature's barriers for the protection of individual in- telligence are swept away, and the subject be- comes a helpless instrument, bound under a bondage of the Soul by an irresistible bond which he alone, without the consent and co- operation of his hypnotist, or other help, can never break. In the development of me- diumship the same conditions obtain on the part of the medium.

The importance of this distinction will ap- pear more vividly to those who are acquainted with the essential difference between mes- merism and hypnotism.

He made it the basis of obtaining control of his subjects, and fully believed that its action was in some way intimately con- nected with all the phenomena growing out oi the relation thereby established. He ob- tained control of his subjects by making mag- netic passes over them from the head down- ward, and at the same time gazing intently in their eyes until the mesmeric sleep was thus induced. Mesmer, however, made the mistake of as- suming that the somnambulic sleep cannot be induced by any other means or methods. Dr. Braid, who adopted the term \"Hyp- notism,\" demonstrated that the somnambulic sleep may be induced without the use of mag- netic passes or other means that supported the magnetic theory.

Thence, as the hypnotic state deepens, it sweeps backward through the third brain, downward through the second brain, and in its final stages is communicated to the primary brain. One of the most invariable manifestations which follow the inception of the hypnotic process is the inability of the subject to con- trol the objective and perceptive faculties of the mind.

In this condition the phys- ical body is no longer an active part of the individual. Notwithstanding this complete suspension of all functional activity of the physical or- ganism, the subject is even more intently con- scious of every thought, intention and men- tal impulse of the hypnotist than he is during any of the less profound states of hypnosis. In proportion as the consciousness of the subject is acted upon through the physical organism, his attention is absorbed in the im- pressions made through those dominant chan- nels, and correspondingly diverted from all other impressions. But as these physical or- gans are silenced and gradually paralyzed by the power of hypnosis the impulses which reach his consciousness through the spiritual 147"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME sensory organism become more and more dis- tinct to him. The relatively stronger of the two sets of impulses is the one which absorbs the attention so long as its dominance con- tinues. When the final state of profound hypnosis has been attained the physical world is en- tirely cut off from the consciousness of the subject. All impressions from that source cease. In this condition, there is nothing to divert his attention from the impressions which now reach him through the spiritual sensory organism alone. But these channels of ingress to the im- prisoned consciousness of the subject are un- der control of the hypnotist. He therefore commands the absolute and undivided atten- tion of his subject. Mence it is that in exact proportion as this state of hypnosis is attained the consciousness of the subject responds to the Will of the operator, and his attention becomes more and more completely riveted upon all that the hypnotist conveys to him. This will explain why it is that the hypno- tist can, by a simple command or impulse of the Will, waken his subject from even this 148"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"HYPNOTISM profound condition of seeming physical death. His ability to waken his subject is at all times commensurate with the degree of control he is able to exercise over him. If, perchance, in the condition above re- ferred to, some accident should occur to break the control of the hypnotist, the phys- ical death of the subject would instantly follow. At this stage of hypnosis, the operator s Will is the only power in existence that holds the two organisms together. In this state of complete functional suspen- sion of the physical organism it is even pos- sible for the operator to force a complete tem- porary separation of the two organisms, and by the power of his Will alone unite them again. In such case he is able to send the temporarily liberated spiritual body and Soul of his subject to distant points and there en- force implicit obedience to his commands within certain well defined limitations. He may thus obtain definite information con- cerning matters at a distance of which he is at the time entirely ignorant.

In like manner it is again declared that hypnotism is the process by and through which a hypnotist obtains, holds and exer- cises control of the Will, voluntary powers and sensory organism of his subject, and only in so far as such control exists is the process hypnotic.

One of these is a spir- itual intelligence, while the other is in the physical body. The spiritual intelligence dominates and controls the Will, voluntary powers and sensory organism of the medium. The medium, being thus under the domina- tion and control of the outside, spiritual in- telligence, is therefore in a subjective con- dition and relation to the exact extent that such control exists. Mediumship, like hypnotism, involves all shades and degrees of control, from the mild- est form of impressional subjection to the deepest and most profound state of lethargic or trance control.

In this case the medium is not only conscious of his physical environment, but is also con- sciously aware of the fact that he is in touch with outside, spiritual intelligences, although he is unable to either see or hear them. He comes into such close relation to them, in fact, that they arc able to control his mental opera- tions to a considerable extent. Even where the medium is admitted to be both honest and intelligent, it is found that this form of mediumship cannot be relied upon with any degree of assurance or cer- tainty. This unreliability arises from the fact that mediums of this class arc unable to diflferentiate accurately between their own in- dependent thoughts and those which are im- pressed upon them from without.

Their control over him is of so subtle a character that he does not recognize it as a power independent of himself. Of this class the following may be taken as typical examples: So-Called \"Inspirational Speakers.\" Such an individual as this goes before his audience wholly unprepared. He depends entirely upon \"the inspiration of the mo- ment.\" When he faces his audience he waits an instant for the \"inspiration\" to take posses- sion of him. When this occurs his whole manner changes. His entire physical body becomes animated. His face takes on an ex- pression of exaltation and rapturous enthusi- asm. Although conscious of what is passing about him upon the physical plane, and fully aware, at the moment, of all he is saying, yet the instant his address is finished his manner changes again even more markedly than at the beginning. There comes an expression of lassitude, a depression of spirit, a physical exhaustion, a general inertia of the entire be- ing. In many instances sleep is an immediate necessity. It is not infrequently the case that the substance of the speaker's address, lecture 153"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE GRKAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRLMF. or sermon, as the case may be, soon passes from his memory entirely, or is recalled witli great difficulty. iMediums of this character, when not under control, are often exceed- ingly impulsive, or moody, and are generally of a highly wrought, nervous temperament. Emotioxal Ixsaxitv. This is the name which the medical fraternity have given to certain phases of unconscious, imprcssional mediumship. Cases of this nature are found in our insane asylums all over the country. They make up a considerable percentage of the so-called insane all over the world. In such cases the medium may gradually settle into a state of melancholy, or become violent- ly hysterical at times, or obtain the impres- sion that he is going to die, or that he is going to fail in business, or that some terrible disas- ter is impending. Such an individual is likely to prophesy all manner of things, fully believing they will surely come true at the appointed time.

Neurotic Mediumship. The process in- volved in this general form of mediumship acts more directly upon the nervous organism of the medium. Its phenomena cover a wide range and it manifests itself in many differ- ent forms. Clairvoyance. Under this form of me- diumship spiritual intelligences who under- stand the process are able to control the nerv- ous organism of the eye through which im- pressions are conveyed to the consciousness of the medium.

This process is identical with that of clairvoyance, except that it is applied to the nervous organism of the ear instead of the eye. In this case the medium hears whatever the controlling intelligences desire that he shall hear, and nothing else.

In this latter case the medium hears whatever there is to be heard upon the spiritual plane within the range of his spiritual hearing. Touch, Taste axd Smell.

Delusional Insanity. Certain forms of so-called \"Delusional Insanity\" also fall un- der this form of neurotic mediumship. Trance Mediumship. The manifestations of trance mediumship are those which usually attract the largest amount of public attention. This is chiefly because they are of a more ex- aggerated and mysterious character, and for this reason appeal with added force to our human sense of curiosity. The phenomena of trance mediumship are many and varied. Those which are most familiar to the general public may be designated as follows: Speaking Mediumship. Under this form of control the medium, generally speaking, is thrown into the deep, lethargic trance. Wher- ever this occurs he is entirely unconscious of what transpires during the trance condition. The dominating intelligences take complete control of his voluntary physical organism and employ it as an instrument for the expres- sion of their own thoughts and desires. 157"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"TllK (JRKAT I'S^CIIOLCKilCAL CRI.MK Through this absolute subjection of the Will and voluntary powers of tlie medium tlic con- trolling spiritual intelligences arc able to use his vocal organs at will. Materializing Mediumship. Under this form of control the medium is first thrown into a state of profound trance. Spiritual in- telligences who understand the process em- ploy t/w vital and jfin^/rietic properties, forces and ener(jies of the medium's physical and spiritual organisms, in conjunction ivith out- side elemental conditions, in such manner as to produce the phenomena of so-called \"Ma- terialization.\" Every living, human, physical organism is a natural generator of physical magnetism and vital energy. In this respect it is closely analogous to an electric dynamo. During the physically negative or passive hours of sleep this human dynamo is con- stantly engaged in generating the necessary magnetism and vital energy with which to propel the machinery of the physical body during the waking hours of the day. The moment an individual awakens from sleep he begins to draw upon this accumulated supply 158"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"MEDIUMSHIP and continues to do so until sleep once more locks the doors of the storehouse and prevents further escape. Physical magnetism and vital energy are constantly expended by the physical body during the waking condition of every indi- vidual. While the medium is in the deep, lethargic trance state the physical body is in a negative or passive condition. In this condition it generates physical magnetism very rapidly. While the physical body of the medium is in this negative condition spiritual forces may be so applied, by those who understand the process, as to draw ofif its physical magnetism and vital energy as rapidly as they are gen- erated. The liberated physical magnetism of a me- dium may be controlled by the action of the Will of one who understands the process by which this is accomplished. When the medium is in a state of deep trance the spiritual controls who understand the process of materialization withdraw from the physical body of the medium all the phys- ical magnetism and vital energy possible.

With this magnetic compound they are able to envelop a spiritual form and thus bring it within the physical view of the sitters. This constitutes what is known as \"Materializa- tion,\" as it is usually witnessed in the materi- alizing seance. Neither the Soul, however, nor the spir- itual body of the departed is made visible to the physical eye. These are just as far from the sight of mortal eyes as they were before the \"materialization\" occurred. The process of \"spirit materialization\" therefore, even when it is genuine, (which is very rarely the case), does not bring the spiritual world nor any of its inhabitants within the limitations of our physical sense perceptions. The only results of that process which are visible to the physical eye of man are entirely physical and not spiritual. True, the spiritual form and entity are back of the physical \"materialization\", or within it; but 160"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"MEDIUMSHIP these are not seen nor sensed by the physical eye. Spiritual controls who understand materi- alization are also able to use the medium's physical body as a \"fashion form,\" and invest it with this materializing substance in such manner as to transfigure or transform it into the representation of many different person- alities. This sort of impersonation is often practiced by unscrupulous spiritual controls, who find it less difficult than complete ma- terialization. Obsession. In its strict sense it is the com- plete possession and domination of a physic- ally embodied individual by an outside intel- ligence. It involves complete trance control wherein : The obsessing intelligence deliberately re- fuses to relinquish his control; Or, the obsessing intelligence is unable to relinquish his control. In either case the obsessed individual is under complete trance control and is wholly unconscious of what he says or does.

It com- bines the elements of a number of them. In this case the medium may be either con- scious or unconscious, according to the intelli- gence of the spiritual controls using him. Two slates are bound together securely, some- times with a small piece of pencil between them, but quite frequently without. Some- times the medium touches the top or edge of the upper slate with the tips of his fingers. Other times the slates are left untouched by anyone until the message is completed.

Trumpet Speaking. This is another form of mediumship which does not fall entirely under any one of the general classes above defined. It is also of a composite nature, in- volving elements of two or more of the sim- pler forms. In this character of mediumship the me- dium and the sitters usually sit in darkness around a table or in a circle. A speaking trumpet is placed upon the table or within the circle for the use of the controls. When the conditions are right the spiritual intelli- gences are able to lift this trumpet from the table, place it to the ear of a sitter and whis- per or speak audibly through it so that the sitter may hear with perfect distinctness.

By this control of the circulation of the medium his skin may be flushed to a deep scarlet or made perfectly white, as the blood is either forced to the surface or withdrawn from it, at the Will of the controlling intelli- gences.

By this method written messages may be made to appear upon the surface of the me- dium's body.

This seems to be the impression which those who employ the term intend to convey. It is the impression which the term conveys to the world, and it is the impression the public in general has obtained.

It is this self-induced, artificial sleep that has been improperly des- ignated \"Auto-Hypnotism.\" This is not hypnotism in any form.

But it possesses the merit of afford- ing a very effectual and satisfactory test. Before retiring for the night he takes his precious jewel from its safety-deposit vault, unwraps it and places it in a conspicuous place in the middle of a table.

His property is still there. This, however, would appear to be the result of his good luck rather than that of his good sense. He repeats the experiment the following night, and upon waking the next morning finds that his jewel is gone. During the night, while sleep has encompassed him and shut his consciousness away from the objective plane of the physical world, someone has entered his home and taken unlawful possession of his property. In other words, a crime has been committed: \"Burglary.\" So long as no sec- ond party entered upon the scene the crime of burglary could not be committed.

In like manner, the individual who throws himself into the artificial sleep which writers and authorities have erroneously designated **Auto-Hypnotism\" has done nothing more than create conditions which make hypnotism an easy possibility. He may, perchance, put himself in this un- natural condition and waken again without having come in touch with a hypnotist at all. In such case hypnosis, in its proper sense, does not occur. Why?

Reverting once more to the definition of hypnotism, it will be observed that it involves elements and conditions which are strangely and significantly analogous to those involved in the crime of burglary. There must be at least two parties to the transaction. One of these must enter the temple of the other, as it were.

Among others, he makes it easily possible for any one of the following results to obtain: He may, unless interfered with, withdraw his consciousness from the objective plane of physical nature and in a perfectly conscious manner — through the medium of his spiritual sensory organs — see, hear and observe what- ever may occur upon the spiritual plane with- in the range of spiritual vision, hearing and observation.

He is con- scious of all that is passing about him upon the physical plane, and so far as he knows is in full possession of all his mental faculties and powers. But while he thus sits with his mind possi- bly in a contemplative mood, perchance thinking of some subject entirely foreign to that of the mediumistic process, suddenly his hand begins to move.

He is not con- scious that its movements are in the slightest degree responsive to his own volition. He has no conscious, anticipatory knowl- edge of what his hand is going to write.

And from the standpoint of his own conscious, personal experience his conclusion would appear to be entirely justi- fied. Herein lies the subtle error. It must not be forgotten that mediumship, like hypnotism, is a subjective, psychic proc- ess. Its primary, motive power is the Soul or intelligence of the dominating control. Those intelligent acts of the physical organism of an individual which are the results of the me- diumistic process, are but reflex activities re- sulting from the action of one mind or intelli- gence upon another. Nature has constituted each individual in- telligence the motive power by which to operate the voluntary processes of his own organism. Through this motive power alone can those organs of the physical body which respond to the Will be intelligently set in motion. The intelligence which seeks to control the movements of any voluntary organ of another intelligent individual can do so only by con- trolling the motive power by which its owner operates it 180"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"AUTOMATIC MEDIUMSHIP The spiritual intelligence which controls the hand of a medium does so only by con- trolling the motive power by which the me- dium himself controls it when acting inde- pendently, namely, his Will.

In short, he maintains that it is impossible for him to act voluntarily without being con- scious that the act performed is responsive to his own Will. It is just here that the mind becomes di- verted from the real principle involved in the mediumistic process. The acts of the me- dium's hand in what is known as automatic writing, considered from the standpoint of the primary impulse which inspires them, are not the results of his own volition.

Because they are able to apply the magnetic forces of the medium, upon which they must depend, to the inanimate substance of the table without having first to overcome an in- telligent and independent Will within it. The human body is completely insulated, as it were, with an aura of physical magnetism which is under the control of its owner and inhabitant (so long as he is not under mental domination and control), while this is not the case with the body of the table.

Physical death does not necessarily break, destroy, counteract nor even mitigate the hyp- notic relation when the same has been fully entered into and established upon the phys- ical plane. It is a well-known fact, fully established by oft-repeated demonstrations, to which hyp- notists of all grades, kinds and schools will testify, that a \"suggestion\" or command given to a subject while he is in a state of profound hypnosis, to be executed or performed at some future time (commonly designated as a post-hypnotic suggestion), will be obeyed with absolute fidelity at the time and place and in the exact manner prescribed. 216"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"POST-MORTEM HYPNOTISM An Hypnotic-\"Suggestion\" (command) may be given today to be executed by the subject a week, a month, a year, or even ten years hence, and when the time comes the command will be executed with perfect fi- delity, even though the subject and the oper- ator may at the time be thousands of miles apart, and the hypnotist may have forgotten the incident entirely.

The question is also asked why it is that the standard of intelligence and morality among mediumistic controls is, on the aver- age, so much lower than that of the medium, and why do they practice so much wilful de- ception and deliberate dishonesty. The answer (usually given by the spiritual controls themselves through the lips of their mediums) is to the effect that they are unable to use the organism of the medium with per- fect facility.

Fix a definite hour for sitting, and begin each sitting promptly at the moment agreed upon.

Select a definite room in which to hold your sittings and always meet in the same room. There is a very exact and scientific reason for this instruction: Physical magnetism is an important factor in the development of mediumship. In order 2+4"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"THE DEVELOPING CIRCLE to accomplish rapid results and waste neither time nor energy, the room in which the sit- tings are held must become thoroughly mag- netized with the physical magnetism of the physical sitters and the spiritual magnetism of the controlling intelligences.

But a room once thoroughly magnetized remains charged for many days. If the sittings are held in a different room each time all this work of magnetization is lost. The time and energy necessary for the actual developing work must be spent at each sitting in creating a new magnetic atmosphere and environ- ment. Therefore hold your sittings in the same room. Until development is well advanced hold all your sittings as nearly as possible in abso- lute darkness. Why? Because the develop- ment of mediumship is a purely negative process on the part of the medium. Darkness is the negative pole of light.

As the mind becomes passive the whole condi- tion of the individual becomes negative. The object of the sitter should be to attain as near- ly as possible a state of absolute negation.

For these reasons, among others, the music should be furnished by those who are not members of the developing circle. When you sit arrange yourselves in a circle in such manner that those of you who are of the negative type or tendency shall alternate with those of you who are of the positive type. Sit with your feet slightly separated and rest- ing squarely on the floor. Join your hands in such manner that the right hand of each sitter shall rest upon the left hand of his next neigh- bor.

Assuming that a circle has been completed in conformity to these instructions, a strong current of physical magnetism flows from hand to hand of the sitters, always from right to left about the circle. The law of magnet- ism is that (except when under control of the Will) it flows from the left hand; that is to say, from right to left about the circle. Scarcely a circle is ever thus formed, but one or more of the sitters, and oftentimes all of them, will be able to feel the magnetic cur- rent with perfect distinctness.

To such an one the following most interesting phenomena are distinctly ap- parent: This current of magnetic light makes a complete chain about the circle. But it ap- pears to make the physical nerve centers its depots, relay stations or storehouses of energy. The unbroken stream of magnetic light passes from hand to hand and thence along the arm, forming a great, round, luminous cord. From each armpit this luminous rope spreads out into a fanlike form until it connects with the central nerve of the spinal column.

When the sitters are in proper position and condition for work the controlling band usually arrange themselves in a larger circle, enclosing them in such manner that the joined hands of the controls rest directly upon the heads of the sitters. In this position their hands meet at the several magazines, or de- pots of magnetic energy, immediately over the nerve centers.

The current is applied to the sitter s forehead in such man- ner as to pass directly through the objective organs of the third brain, which lie immedi- ately above and back of the eyes. Thence it is caused to sweep backward and downward through the secondary and primary brains in the order named. The exact part which this magnetic current plays in the controlling process depends somewhat upon the particular form of me- diumship sought to be developed.

It was conducted by one of the most eloquent and enthusiastic revivalists of the country. From the results of his work it would appear that he possessed the ability to play upon all the strings of emotional human nature at will. His stock of pathetic stories seemed inexhaustible, and the manner in which he employed them as fuel to warm up the emotional sympathies of his hearers was both dramatic and artistic as well as highly entertaining. A \"mourners' bench\" was provided in the foreground, where \"sinsick\" souls were urged to go and kneel for prayer. Those who went were supposed to be \"under conviction.\" These constituted the specific storm center of interest and effort. The special purpose was to carry them to the point of \"conversion.\" 255"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRLVIE This was the goal toward which all effort tended. A choir of sympathetic voices sang and chanted pathetic hymns, and all things com- bined to excite religious enthusiasm and emo- tional fervor.

This continued with an ever-increasing enthusiasm, until the atmos- phere seemed to vibrate with intense emotion. Gradually men and women began to give way to their emotions. One after another they found their way to the \"mourners' bench,\" where they knelt to pray and mourn over their sins. In the midst of prayers and songs and exhortations and agonizing groans and ecstatic shouts they worked themselves and each other, and were worked, into a state of emotional frenzy. When, through the eflPects of emotional sub- jectivity, an individual felt himself distinctly in touch with the spiritual plane of intelli- gence, he sprang to his feet and proclaimed in 256"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"REVIVALISM ecstatic shouts that he was \"saved.\" In some instances, the individual fell prostrate upon the floor in a condition of trance.

For the time being they felt that they were in the atmosphere of another world, and so they were. This to them meant \"salvation.\" All their effort had been to receive seme \"sign\" which should be to them a token that their sins had been forgiven. This touch with the spiritual world answered to them as the \"sign\" for which they had labored and suf- fered. It therefore had but one meaning. It was the tangible and therefore unmistakable evidence of \"salvation.\" It could mean noth- ing else. And thus, \"many were brought to Christ,\" and the revival was deemed a great success. Those who assume to assert that the experi- ences of these good people are but the results of imagination are grievously mistaken.

During the course of the acquaintance, in re- sponse to a line of inquiry, he stated that he seldom made any definite or special prepara- tion for his meetings. He had found that he seemed to do better work when he trusted en- tirely to \"the inspiration of the moment.\" It was his custom to enter upon a revival meet- ing with just one central purpose, and that was to \"Work 'em up, work 'em up, and keep right on working 'em up,\" until he got them to \"climbing over each other to get to the mourners' bench.\" 258"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"REVIVALISM With much enjoyable enthusiasm he re- counted an instance wherein he succeeded in rousing his hearers to such a pitch of emo- tional enthusiasm that as many as twenty or more fell in convulsions during a single serv- ice and had to be removed from the room.

When the revival season came on again and he returned to them, he found it necessary to begin all over again and \"work 'em up\" from the beginning.

To one who is able at Will to view a revival service from the spiritual plane as well as from the physical, these perplexing questions are all fully and rationally answered. There are within the first spiritual plane vast multitudes of spiritual intelligences who actively participate in these revival services. Many of these are religious fanatics who have carried their religious enthusiasm with them into the spiritual life. They find a character of sensuous satisfaction in the magnetic con- ditions which result from these revival serv- ices. From the spiritual plane they supple- ment the work of the minister as far as possi- ble. Whenever and wherever they find it possible to do so they bring to those who are upon the earth plane definite spiritual ex- 260"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"REVIVALISM periences. It is these and such as these who furnish the \"power\" which is so distinctly felt by many of the most emotional workers from the physical plane. Then again, in addition to these religious devotees upon the spiritual plane there are also vast multitudes of \"earth-bound\" spir- itual people who find a wholly different and much less worthy character of satisfaction in these revival meetings. Through the nega- tive condition of intense emotionalism these often find it possible to ride into the con- sciousness of the sinner \"under conviction,\" as it were, and take complete control of all his intelligent faculties, capacities and pow- ers.

This also explains why it is that many a troubled Soul is unable to feel the \"thrill\" of the \"Divine Presence\" except when the revival is on. To feel good is one thing. To be good or do good is quite another. It not infrequently occurs that those upon the earth plane who have been most success- ful in reaching a state of emotional subjectiv- ity are left unprotected upon the spiritual plane when the revivalist and his helpers pass to other fields of labor. In such instances it almost invariably follows that evil spiritual people take the place of the helpers and grad- ually obtain complete control of the individ- ual. The result is some form of insanity or religious mania, often ending in murder, sui- cide, or a formal commitment to an insane asylum.

It is true that their reasons do not always appear to be very well or clearly defined.

In addition to this natural condition she became interested in the subject of spirit- ualism and was ultimately developed as a medium. After this, for some time, she de- voted the larger part of her time and energies to her mediumistic work. During the entire year immediately preceding the birth of her daughter she was the principal medium for a group of scientific investigators of psychic phenomena. The daughter was born under these conditions. From the time she was old enough to ex- press herself this child was what is often termed a \"natural psychic.\" She saw clair- voyantly and heard clairaudiently without the necessity for any effort on her part. Until she was six years old she spent the greater portion of her waking hours playing with her \"invisible\" playmates from the spiritual world. At the age of seven she was regularly developed as a trance medium. This instance clearly shows the effects of heredity as well as those of prenatal condi- tions upon the development of children.

It is not necessary for such an individual to sit in a circle for me- diumistic development. All he needs is to live for a time on a negative vegetable diet. Spiritual intelligences will do the rest. Solitude has the effect of producing a men- tally negative condition. This is because of the natural tendency to mental abstraction which follows from solitude. Man upon the physical plane is eminently a social being. If deprived of the society of his kind his mind involuntarily seeks companionship in the realms of thought. This habit of contempla- tion without definite purpose produces a psy- chically negative condition. The developed medium is able to demonstrate the truth of this proposition at any time. The presence of his friends occupies his mind upon the plane of his physical environment, and he ac- cordingly finds it difficult to surrender him- self to the mediumistic process in their pres- ence. But a few moments of solitude pro- 271"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME duces the negative condition necessary and he falls into subjection without effort. Darkness is a negative physical condition. It has upon man a double negative effect. It produces natural relaxation of the physical organism and at the same time an introspect- ive condition of the mind. Both of these are negative in effect. Darkness, therefore, is most favorable to mediumistic control. This has been fully demonstrated by mediums themselves very often. This is the secret of the dark circle. It is the principle at the foundation of the dark cabinet and the dark materializing seance. Introspection means \"looking within,\" or, \"inspection of the within.\" As a metaphys- ical proposition it is a condition of conscious- ness in which the objective faculties of the mind are inactive. The mind takes no note or account of the things that are at the time occurring upon the physical plane. It is con- cerned with those things only which lie with- in the conscious Soul of the individual him- self. It is occupied with the internal plane of conscious intelligence. In this condition the physical body is always in a negative or 272"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"WHAT OF THE NEGATIVE? passive state. In this condition the active, dominating intelligence from w^ithout may ride into the very center of individual con- sciousness and, unless opposed, may assume control of all the faculties, capacities and powers of the Soul.

By so doing it opens the wslj to either hypnotic or spiritual control. Fasting is, primarily, a purely physical process, although it has a strong reflex action upon the mind also. When the stomach is supplied with food all the organs of the phys- ical body related to the processes of digestion, distribution, assimilation and secretion are in a state of involuntary activity.

During this period of waiting the internal organism of the physical body is in a negative or passive condition.

Solitude, Introspection, Emotionalism and Self-Indulgence are all conducive to psychic subjection.

It makes of him a mere plaything for the 274"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"WHAT OF THE NEGATIVE? entertainment of those of his fellows who desire to amuse themselves at his expense. Worst of all, it makes of him a dependent, a mere servant, a slave, a menial, a puppet, a serf.

The second, the practical joker, intends neither good nor ill, as a general rule, but seeks only to gratify his sense of amusement at the harmless expense of his friends. The third, the chronic experimenter, is moved almost entirely by the desire to satisfy his sense of the curious and the mysterious. He has, in reality, neither good nor evil in his mind, and thinks little or nothing of the results in so far as they may affect others. He cares for neither the advancement of science on the one hand nor the alleviation of human suffering on the other. Judged by their motives and intentions alone, and from the purely ethical views of men, there is in the attitude of these three classes of hypnotists little to condemn and practically nothing to commend. Their po- sition is indeed one which may be fittingly designated as morally indifferent. Passing to the third general class, it is 283"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME found that those hypnotists whose motives and intentions are unquestionably bad nat- urally group themselves into three distinct classes : Those who practice hypnotism as a profes- sion or business, and depend upon such prac- tice for their financial support. Those who employ it as a means of power whereby to achieve their individual ambi- tions in life and gratify their desire for a personal popularity before the world. Those who use it as a subtle means and method whereby to commit unusual crimes in such manner as to avoid detection and evade the just penalties of the law. In the first instance the impelling motive is money, in the second power and popular- ity, and in the third self-gratification and con- quest. The first represents the gratification of Greed, the second means the gratification of Vanity, and the third stands for Self-indul- gence — gratification of the baser appetites, evil passions and criminal desires.

Like their fitting companions in crime — the thief, the burglar, the ravisher and the murderer — they work under cover of darkness as far as possible. Hence it is that they almost en- tirely escape public attention and are thus enabled to exercise the subtle and irresistible power of Black Magic without even so much as a fear of detection.

Those v^hose motives and intentions are in- different. Those whose motives and intentions are bad. The actual results accomplished do not necessarily correspond with the motives and ijitentions of the medium in any case. Re- sults, therefore, cannot be taken as an index of the motives which inspire them. Among those mediums whose motives and intentions are admittedly good, are: The religious medium. The melancholy medium. The student medium. The healing medium. 297"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME The religious medium, like the religious minister, verily believes that he is divinely called to do an important work among men. His mission is to preach and teach the gos- pel of truth as he sees it and understands it. His confidence in the integrity and the wis- dom of his spiritual guides and controls is as implicit as that of the minister in his God, and, as a general rule, far more definite and intelligent. The melancholy medium has but one mo- tive. He desires to be reunited with the loved ones who have descended ahead of him into the valley of the shadow and have passed from his physical vision. The impelling mo- tive is love, the highest and noblest activity of the Soul. It is the one motive of all mo- tives which commends itself to every intelli- gent man and woman. Inspired by the hope of bridging the dark gulf which separates the average mortal from the absent loved ones, many an honest man and woman have sub- mitted to the mediumistic process with no thought of its possible danger or harmfulness or immorality. The student medium is in search of knowl- 298"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"WHAT OF THE MEDIUM? edge. He devotes himself to the practice of mediumship in order that he may acquire it. There is not so much of the altruistic in his motives and intentions as there is in those of the religious medium. But we all recognize the value of knovs^ledge, even though the purpose which inspires the search for it may be more or less tinged with selfishness. The healing medium occupies a somewhat different position. He is led by his controls to believe that he possesses great healing powers which he is under obligation to de- vote to the interests of humanity. By a sort of compact between him and his controls he surrenders himself as an instrument in their hands for healing purposes in return for the services they render him in a financial way. It is a species of bargain and sale which is recognized by most men and women as en- tirely legitimate. From the standpoint of mo- tive alone, quite aside from the question of the principle and the process involved, we are therefore not in position to condemn the healing medium any more than we are the Christian Scientist or the metaphysical healer. 299"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME It must not be forgotten, that in all these instances we are always compelled to con- sider the results to both the individual and societ}\\ Therefore, in the final analysis of mediumship and the mediumistic process we cannot stop with the motives and intentions of the medium any more than we can with those of the anarchist who assassinates the president of a great nation under the mis- taken conviction that he is thereby rendering a great and valuable service to society. The final tribunal to which all these questions must be submitted for ethical judgment must take into account not only the motives and in- tentions of the individual, but his rights, duties and obligations as well, both to him- self and to society of which he is an integral part. Among those mediums whose motives and intentions are neither good nor bad, but more properly designated as indifferent, the fol- lowing classes are most conspicuous: The curiosity seeker. The entertainer. There are a good many mediums who be- come such solely because of their desire to 300"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"WHAT OF THE MEDIUM? satisfy their sense of curiosity concerning mediumistic phenomena. After this has been satisfied their interest in the subject ceases. They have in their minds neither good nor evil, and think little or nothing of the results to either themselves or others. There are many others who submit them- selves to the mediumistic process solely for the pleasure it affords their friends. By this method they become successful entertainers and thereby gratify a certain sense of vanity which is not at all uncommon among both men and women. The motive is more or less complex in its essential nature, but when analyzed carefully, defines itself as neither essentially good nor essentially bad. Since there is little, if anything, to con- demn and practically nothing to commend in the motives of these two classes of mediums, it seems both consistent and proper to classify them among those whose motives and inten- tions are indifferent. Those mediums whose motives and inten- tions are unquestionably bad naturally group themselves as follows : 301"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME The business medium. The ambitious medium. The vicious medium. The faker medium. In the first and fourth classes here men- tioned the impelling motive is money, in the second power and popularity, and in the third self -gratification and conquest.

The business medium flourishes in great abundance in all the large cities of the coun- try. His advertisements are found in all the leading metropolitan journals. They are, for the most part, as false as it is possible to frame falsehoods in human language.

As a result, there are times when the me- dium's stock of vitality is so low he is unable to furnish sufficient to meet the demands of his controls for genuine materialization. But the public has been invited and has paid its hard-earned money to see the wonderful \"phenomenon\" of materialization. After the first failure they go away dissatis- fied.

The motive is almost as base as that w^hich inspires the business medium and the faker. The vicious medium belongs to a class by himself. His central purpose is to gratify as far as possible the baser appetites, evil pas- sions and criminal desires of a perverse and degenerate nature. He lives entirely upon the plane of the senses. His mediumship rep- resents a voluntary alliance between degen- erate spiritual intelligences on the one side and a depraved human intelligence on the other. The purpose is mutual sensuous grati- fication. It is a vs^ell known fact of Natural Science that between the licentious of earth and the licentious of the spiritual world the sex ap- petites, passions and desires constitute a powerful magnetic bond. It Is known that through the mediumistic process these libid- inous appetites, passions and desires may be gratified, to a considerable extent. It is also known that in many instances this abnormal and illegitimate relation between medium and control is substituted for the normal rela- tion upon the plane of physical nature. 309"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME The fact that prostitution of this lascivious character is a possibility will come to many an honest Soul with a shock of horror and profound disgust.

From the standpoint of the actor the moral quality of every act of an intelligent individ- ual must be measured by the motive which prompts it.

There are two general classes of results which must be taken into account: Those which affect the medium. Those which do not affect the medium. Those results of the mediumistic process which do not affect the medium may be sub- divided as follows: (a) Those results which affect such of the sitters, in a spiritualistic seance or circle, as are not in the least mediumistic. For the sake of avoiding all questions of controversy it will be admitted that a fair proportionate number of this class have been convinced by mediumistic phenomena that there is a life after physical death. These have come to believe that through medium- ship it is possible to communicate with and receive communications from those on the spiritual side of life. Thus they are given a belief, and their faith is established. 311"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME The nature of the messages received and the phenomena witnessed, however, has pro- duced upon them very different results. On the one hand, where the communications have been intelligent and of a sufficiently high moral tone, the results have been, to all appearances, of a beneficial character. They have, at least, brought to the recipients a cer- tain amount of hope and a comforting assur- ance that physical death does not end all. On the other hand, in quite as many in- stances, the nature of the messages received and the character of the phenomena wit- nessed have been so entirely devoid of intel- lectual merit, moral quality and common honesty as to convey the impression that the spiritual world is exclusively inhabited by imbeciles, fools, liars and knaves. In all such instances the results have been of the most unfortunate character. They have brought neither comfort nor hope nor an in- spiration to better living. Then again, many of this class have spent years investigating the subject only to turn from it all, weary and heart-sick and dis- gusted, with the firm and unalterable con- 312"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"WHAT ARE THE RESULTS? viction that it is all a fraud from beginning to end. If skeptical at the beginning, their skepticism has been thereby many times in- tensified. If religiously inclined, their faith in both God and man has been completely shattered.

Subsequent results. The immediate physical results of the me- diumistic process upon the medium may be briefly summarized: (a) The mediumistic process acts direct- ly upon the physical brain of the medium in the reverse order of its evolutionary devel- opment. (b) Its primary physiological action is upon the objective and perceptive organs of the brain which lie immediately above and back of the eyes.

The subsequent results of the mediumistic process upon the physical organism of the medium are: (a) As the mediumistic state or condi- tion is developed through a series of sittings the nervous organism of the medium be- comes more and more acutely sensitive to the pressure of its environment.

As the process of me- diumistic subjection progresses this state of nervous sensibility to environment usually leads to insomnia and thence to intense ner- vous irritability.

This is illustrated by the fact that wher- ever the medium voluntarily submits to con- trol (under the mutual agreement that the spiritual intelligences are to have the use of the medium's physical organism at stated in- tervals without opposition), they seldom hold the medium under complete and continuous subjection longer than from one to two hours at any one time. Mediums themselves invariably recognize this condition of magnetic and vital depletion after each mediumistic subjection.

(f) The amount of magnetic and vital energy thus appropriated and expended by the controls depends somewhat on the form of mediumship employed. It is a fact well known to every one who has given the subject consideration that the process of materialization calls for the largest expenditure of magnetic and vital energy within a given period of time. Other forms of complete trance control follow next in reg- ular order, and so on down through all the other forms of partial control.

This is also fully verified by the most re- cent and reliable statistics, which show that the average life of the medium, dating from the development of the mediumistic condi- tion, is only a fraction over seven years. This includes mediums of both sexes and all ages who have given themselves up to the prac- tice of mediumship either regularly or as a business. It is true that there are a few very remark- able exceptions where mediumistic subjection has followed with reasonable regularity over a period of years.

It is known that in this particular instance the magnetic and vital energies of the me- dium, appropriated by her controls, were im- mediately resupplied to her from the nega- tive and mediumistic members of her audi- ence. In this event the largest ultimate draft was upon the audience instead of the me- dium. The audience was the sufferer in this instance without knowing it.

To a proportionate degree it is the experience of every other medium, whether he is able to measure it or not. It is a condition which may be observed by every individual who is in position to study the ef- fects of mediumship upon the mental powers of a medium. An important fact from the standpoint of the individual is that almost every desired result may be accomplished by at least two different methods or processes, one of which is ethically right and the other ethically wrong.

In the final results, there is an important distinction between the position of the hyp- notist and that of the spiritual control. The hypnotist is on the same plane with his subjects, while the spiritual control is not. For this reason the hypnotist has an im- mense advantage in point of facility. He is therefore in position to accomplish vastly more harm upon the physical plane to both himself and others. One professional hypnotist alone who is de- voting his time and effort to his profession may, within the period of a very few years, accomplish the complete subjection and con- trol of a thousand different subjects.

There are many instances where an anaes- thetic is desirable, and upon broad, humani- tarian grounds would be deemed entirely justifiable.

The physician and the surgeon limit their use of physical anaesthetics to the temporary relief of unendurable pain or suf- fering. They at no time employ these agen- cies for the purpose of concealment or decep- tion. It is also true that when the physician or the surgeon administers anaesthetics he ac- companies their use with remedial agencies intended to correct, restore and cure. He does not leave the disease to pursue its work of destruction unmolested. Hypnotism is only a fatal blind that de- ceives both the patient and the public, as well as the hypnotist himself, concerning the ac- tual conditions.

And here a wholly different element enters into the proposition. // is found that Insanity is the natural se- quel of the hypnotic process. The gravity of this statement is fully ap- preciated. It is not made lightly, nor v^ithout the most unqualified and conclusive evidence back of it. This subject has been studied quite inde- pendently of its relation to the subject of ther- apeutics. It is found that among hypnotic subjects of all classes, including those w^ho become such for experimental purposes and for entertainment and amusement, as well as for the treatment of disease, a fraction over nine per cent, develop insanity in its various forms and phases. For the sake of perfect fairness it is proper to state that a certain per- centage of the cases of this character results from the practice of hypnotism for other than therapeutic purposes. The record, however, is especially signifi- cant and valuable from a therapeutic stand- point, in that it demonstrates beyond all question that hypnotism practiced without 331"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME destructive intent is nevertheless destructive in its effects. This, perhaps, is as nearly a fair test of its therapeutic value as it is possible to apply upon the plane of its purely physical aspect. It now becomes necessary to examine the subject from the standpoint of the actual re- sults of mediumship as they translate them- selves into the inspirations, emotions, im- pulses, desires, appetites, passions, actions and life of the medium himself. The man who continually fails, neglects or refuses to discharge his individual responsi- bility by the exercise of self-control of all the elements of his nature, inevitably sinks to the level of animal life. There is no other des- tiny for him. In exact proportion as he fails, neglects or refuses to discharge his duty or obligation which God or Nature has fixed upon him, just because he is a man, in like proportion he approaches the level of animal nature.

In equal measure, there- fore, as this becomes a fixed and permanent result of mediumship, the medium is de- prived of the powder of Self-Control, and necessarily sinks toward the level of ani- mal nature. This is the Universal Law of Gravity. In exact proportion as the individual loses the pov^er of Self-Control, or voluntarily sus- pends its exercise, the check upon his baser nature is relaxed and the restraint upon his grosser appetites, passions, emotions, desires and propensities is removed. This is inevita- ble. Every man and every w^oman living has no doubt demonstrated a thousand times over the operation of this law of Nature. Harsh and unlovely and revolting as the thought may be when set out in cold, unsym- pathetic type, it is nevertheless a fact. Inasmuch as mediumship slowly but surely destroys the individual power of Self-Con- trol, its inevitable tendency is toward degen- eracy. The law is inexorable. It is an uncom- promising fact of Nature, as patent as that an apple severed from the limb on which it 333"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME grows will fall to the ground.

But what of the statistical facts? Do they verify or disprove the principle here de- clared? From the class of mediums whose develop- ment has been sufficient to establish definite and unqualified results, science has gathered and is able to formulate and present the fol- lowing verified results of the mediumistic process upon the medium: Seventy-three per cent, of the professional mediums referred to sooner or later develop abnormally increased and uncontrollable sex- ual passions, while as high as ninety-two per cent, show marked increase of the sexual an- petite or desire.

This is usually the case wherever the me- dium is constitutionally of a strongly prepon- derating physical nature. In proportion as this is true he surrenders himself to the me- diumistic process, more especially to its de- grading suggestions, with diminished reluc- tance.

Light is more attractive to him than darkness. It is more agreeable and pleasant to do right for the sake of principle than to do wrong for selfish gain. It is easier to rise to higher levels of life and action than sink to lower planes of existence. In this state reason has finally triumphed over all the debasing in- fluences of the appetites, passions, emotions, impulses and desires.

It is here that every individual intelligence must fight the crucial battle of self. Here it is that he is subject to the active play of all the op- posing and contending forces of Nature.

Let us return to the plane of the mineral kingdom, and, looking upward from another point of vision, study the evolutionary ascent of Nature as it is indicated in the principle of growth or accretion. In this examination let us view the subject from both the ethereal and the physical planes of life at the same time. In the mineral kingdom growth of the ethereal body ceases when the growth of the physical is arrested. In the vegetable kingdom this appears to be the case also, but there are some well- defined indications which suggest that this may be only an appearance and not a fact. 3S0"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"THE WAY OF DEATH In the animal kingdom all uncertainty is dispelled.

In this latter case the spiritual body continues to grow after physical death, and in most instances — more especially among what we term the higher animals — spiritual growth continues until the spiritual organism reaches what appears to be spiritual maturity. In the kingdom of man this evolutionary phase of life reaches its climax. Here it is observed that however young the infant man may be, if it has reached co-ordination with the Soul Element of Nature and breathed the breath of its higher life, the death of the physical body appears to have no effect what- ever upon the continued growth of the spir- itual, other than to retard it somewhat.

By the exercise of this power he may per- petuate his individual life upon the spiritual planes indefinitely.

Every living, human organism is a natural generator of physical magnetism. The magnetic energy generated by it is un- der the domination and control of the JVill of the owner and inhabitant of that or- ganism. Just why this is so may, perhaps, never be fully understood until man has fathomed the action and the purposes of Creative Intelli- gence. All that is known concerning it at the present time is that it is simply a fact which has been often demonstrated with scientific certainty. This magnetic energy is an important fac- tor in the process by and through lihich the Will of every intelligent, living, human be- ing maintains and exercises control over the voluntary, nervous and muscular organisms.

When spiritual intelligences undertake to control the hand of a human being they find that the only process by which this can be done is by controlling the magnetic forces of that individual's physical organism. Na- ture, without consulting mankind, has given to each and every intelligent individual, do- minion and power over the magnetic forces of his own physical body.
