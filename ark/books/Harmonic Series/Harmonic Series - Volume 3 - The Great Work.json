By thus equipping man with such faculties, capacities and powers as enable him to act voluntarily and independently Nature has made it possible for him to add his own in- telligent effort to the evolutionary impulse of Nature and by so doing he is able to carry forward the evolutionary process far beyond the point where Nature would be compelled to stop if man refused his cooperation. By thus investing man with the Soul At- tributes of Consciousness, Independent Choice and Rational Volition, Nature has made it possible for us to pursue a neu- tral course.

The higher the speed the greater the power. In the realm of mechanics, if we would have speed we must be willing to compen- sate for It in power. If the degree of power is fixed and remains the same, then if we would increase the speed we must be willing to compensate for it in volume. The law is that \"other things being"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE GRLAT WORK equal, the greater the speed the smaller the volume.\" Let us suppose that 100 horsepower ap- plied to a 2,000 pound car will propel it at a speed of 60 miles an hour. Now, if we desire to move the same car at a higher rate of speed we can do so only by increasing the number of horsepower. If we desire greater speed in this case, we are compelled to compensate for it in power. But suppose we desire to increase the speed without increasing the number of horsepower above 100. How can we accomplish the de- sired increase of speed? This can be done by reducing the weight (or volume) of our car. If we reduce the weight of our car to 1,000 pounds, our 100 horsepower will propel it at a much higher rate of speed than it would propel the 2,000 pound car. In this case, if we would increase the speed we must be will- ing to compensate for speed with weight (or volume). There is in Nature a mechanical law of compensation.

In that event all our actions and reactions would be as automatic and mechanical as are those of the chemical atoms of the physical universe. The Law of Compensation would then sat- isfy itself in us as it does in the chemical universe. As automatons we would have no choice of action. We would satisfy the law, but it would be an automatic or mechanical satisfaction and not a voluntary or intelligent one from the standpoint of an individual.

For this reason they cannot be determined in advance by the application of mathematical rules or mechanical principles, with absolute cer- tainty or precision.

If man were nothing more than a mere physical organism, subject alone to the laws of physical material, there could be no such thing as progression, and hence no such thing as evolution. The Law of Compensation in the realm of physics de- mands that the giving and the receiving shall be absolutely equal. If not in kind, it must be so in equivalent. This means, from a pure- ly material viewpoint, that there can be no such thing as \"progression\" or \"evolution.\" In the realm of material nature, if you re- ceive from your neighbor a bushel of corn, you must either return to him a bushel of corn or its equivalent in value.

In the realm of physical nature, and on the plane of purely physical things — things that are portable and may be fenced ofif from other physical things — we have our man- made Law of Compensation.

It represents man's efforts to define what he is pleased to term his \"Property Rights\" and his \"Personal Rights\" in his relation to his fellow man, and establish these upon a basis of \"Equity, Justice and Right.\" Because the statutes of the several states are made by men, and because the laws therein contained are man-made laws, it follows that the penalties which are prescribed in case of their violation are penalties w^hich man only can enforce. They are not automatic in their action, as are the laws of Nature. For this reason men who are not law-abiding find it possible to evade many of them in such man- ner as to avoid the penalties they prescribe.

In that event no man would violate the law unless he were ready and willing to suffer the penalty prescribed for such violation. It is only because violations of man-made laws must first be discovered by other men, and the penalties prescribed for such viola- tions, if enforced at all, must be enforced by men, that the \"Laws of the Land\" are so little respected. It is because of these inadequacies in the systems of men and in the uncertainty with which their laws are enforced and adminis- tered, that men in all the walks of life have grown habitually lawless.

In due time you will find it possible to reduce many of the complex and intricate problems of your own life to the same simple basis.

It marks the first pivotal point, the first great \"parting of ways\" in the journey of individual life, at which every in- telligent Soul must arrive, sooner or later.

If we proceed beyond this point we 193"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"THE GREAT WDRK must travel one or the other of these, for we caniKJt travel both. One of these pathways leads to the North toward the Land of Spiritual Darkness and Death, the other to the South toward the Land of Spiritual Light and Life.

The one ends in the complete subjection and enslavement of an Individual Intelligence, with all its faculties, capacities and powers; the other in the ultimate and complete eman- cipation of a Soul from the gravitative in- fluence of evil and the destructive tendencies. These are not mere figures of speech. They give expression to a profound scientific and historic truth as real as life itself. From the remotest period in the march of human progress, of which we have any au- thentic data, to the present time, the mighty, ceaseless and ever increasing column of hu- manity has been marching onward and up- ward along the evolutionary pathway of life to this first great Mile-Post and Parting of Ways.

The path to the South is extremely narrow and rough, up-hill all the way, in the sun and facing the wind. To travel this way is diffi- cult. It calls for the most intense and unre- mitting Personal Effort. Every step of the way the traveler must overcome the pull of gravity from behind and the push of the wind in front. He must climb over many an ob- struction and remove many an obstacle from his way. He must do all this himself. For the path is so narrow and the footing so diffi- cult that there is room for only one at a time. The traveler next in front and the one next behind are both so busy with their own climbing that they cannot carry him.

It has been found by actual test, that if an individual will ''Live the Life\"; if he will conform his life to the demands of the Ethical Formulary, and then practice ''Tem- perance in all things,'' the subject of diet will adapt itself to the specific needs and demands of that life.

He knows that death does not end his career. He knows that his personal iden- tity will not be lost, nor even clouded for an hour. He knows that in death there is no sting. When he approaches the final hour for parting with the physical it is to him but the hour of his liberation and his reward. From his earthly environment he passes with all his faculties and powers intact. He is conscious of what is taking place about him and within him. He knows his destination, for he has been over the pathway and back again many times. When he has made the Transition he knows that in passing from this life into the spiritual he is but entering into other and larger fields of evolutionary opportunities and possi- bilities. 383"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE GREAT WORK He is Master of the \"Messenger of Death.\" For him there are no ''Terrors at the Threshold\" to be encountered.

Every step of the way from the plane of earth, through all the phases and mysteries of the Magnetic Field, into and through the First, Second, Third and Fourth Spiritual Planes, beyond these still upward and on- ward to the highest point of his individual attainment, is already familiar through his previous experiences. In the year 1897 there passed through the Gates of Physical Death into the splendors of the Higher Life one of the greatest of these earthly Masters. He was not known in this country, though he had been in our midst, studied our people and laid the foundation of this modern pres- entation of the Ancient Science. He was an Oriental, who was born a Prince of India and who was indeed of royal spirit as well as of name and estate.

This he did that he might the better meet his opportunity and from the common level of poverty receive his instruction, make the demonstration and serve mankind. Great Intelligence, Great Heart, Great Soul, whose wisdom and whose service have carried him far beyond the shining walls of the lower Spiritual Planes and given him place and authority among the Powers of Light in distant Realms! By his knowledge of the laws of Nature he had lengthened the span of his physical life far beyond the \"allotted time of man.\" This he did, not that he desired life in the body, but that he elected to remain until he had finished certain tasks set for himself by himself which he regarded as part of his Personal Responsibility to mankind.

Then having re- turned again to the seclusion of the Central Temple, here among his Brothers in the Great Work he made the transition, leaving to them the simple ceremony of scattering his ashes to the winds.

E. RICHARDSON, TK. Vol. II HARMONIC SERIES The book is a masterpiece of consistent statement and logical development. The subject of Insanity is daily assuming greater importance. At least 58 per cent of the so-called Insane can be absolutely cured. This book tells how and why this is true. It makes clear many of the greatest puzzles of medical science. This is the book which shows how and why those who seek, by means of experiments with Hypnotism, Spiritualism and Mediumship, to prove that there is another life after death, fail to accomplish it scien- tifically, fail to get the satisfaction they seek, and often end in insane asylums. The author's analysis of Hypnotism and Medium- ship is masterly and complete. For fifteen chapters by the most relentless logic and unanswerable facts, which no one has challenged, he proves that Sub- jective Spiritual \"Mediumship\" and Hypnotism are vitally destructive to the physical body and the Human Soul. No orthodox Christian, Spiritualist, Agnostic, Professional Alienist, Professor of Psychology, nor Judge on the bench should pass this book unread. Every practicing physician owes it to himself and the community in which he lives, to study and weigh the statements in this book; for he can no longer stultify his conscience by opposing the demonstrable facts of science; because it may not come through the \"regular\" channels, or the particular school he may happen to represent.
