This important key fits perfectly into the lock of mystery which seems to have baffled and disheartened so many honest and intelligent searchers of the past. This lineal key constitutes the means by which the searcher intelligently may trace every religious or philosophic movement to its natural antecedents and determine with unerring certainty to which of the two great world-forces it belongs. With such a key in his possession he may know with accuracy whether any such move- ment stands for Light or Darkness, Freedom or Slavery, Evolution or Devolution, Con- struction or Destruction. From the early dawn of civilization to the immediate present, so far as we are able to determine, two active and opposing psycho- logical forces have been and still are engaged u"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE in a seemingly irrepressible conflict over the status and legitimate function of Individual Intelligence in its relation to humanity as an aggregate organism. These two great forces divided and stand opposed to each other, upon the vital and fundamental problem of man's rights and privileges, duties and responsibilities as an Individual Intelligence. One of these mighty psychological forces has constantly, unfalteringly and consistently moved forward in the direct line of man's highest individual development and largest personal liberty in his evolutionary search for individual happiness. It has fostered the spirit and encouraged the growth of constructive individuality in its deepest, broadest and fullest sense. It has given both dignity and emphasis to Individual Intelli- gence as the natural and essential basis of all human progress. Its action, at all times and under all conditions, has been in the direct line of intelligent, individual unfoldment. Its psychological results have been and are con- structive in their relation to and their effects"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE LINEAL KEY upon men and women as individualized, in- telligent Souls. The other of these great, psychological world-forces has just as constantly, unhesitat- ingly and consistently moved forward in the direct line of man's suppression and subjec- tion in his individual capacity. It has antag- onized the spirit and discouraged the idea and growth of individual liberty at every point. It has constantly minimized and depreciated Individual Intelligence as a factor in human progress. Its action, at all times and under all conditions, has made for individual sub- ordination and subjection. Its results, there- fore, have been throughout the past, and must ever be, destructive in their relation to and their action upon men, women and children as individualized, intelligent Souls. The first of these two great psychological world-forces — which we designate as \"Con- structive\" — crystallized into a definite human organization. That organization was and is the venerable Brotherhood of Ancient India, herein referred to as \"The Great School of the Masters.\" The other of the two great world-forces —"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE which we denominate the \"Destructive\" — was ultimately crystallized into a great and pow- erful organization with its active center of radiation and power in Egypt. This was the School which has come to be recognized as the \"School of Black Magic,\" or of \"The Black Art,\" which in later form came to be known as the \"School of Egyptian Pagan- ism.\" This School assumed definite organic form in Egypt and therein became a dominant and actively dominating power but a compara- tively short time before the final withdrawal of the Great School of the Masters from that field. It was, in truth, the direct and imme- diate cause of that withdrawal. It must be understood, that the great Egyptian School was not the first organized expression of the destructive psychological force in human society. On the contrary, it would not only seem possible, but probable beyond a reasonable doubt, that it received its inspiration from some antecedent organ- ization of much greater antiquity. How- ever this may be, its history and lineage back- ward to this point are clear and unbroken. 14"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE LINEAL KEY What they may or may not be still farther back in the remoter ages, is not of vital im- portance in this connection. It is sufficient for our present purpose that this Great Egyp- tian Organization, in the natural course of events, itself became a progenitor, and that its living progeny is with us today in the visible form, presence and personnel of one of the most vitally active and powerful human or- ganizations on earth. Among the most prominent and impor- tant movements that are lineally descended from, and directly related in principle to the Great Parent School of India — The Great School of the Masters — are: Freemasonry, both ancient and modern; Buddhism, in its origin and primitive char- acter; Primitive Christianity, as exemplified by the Master Jesus; Protestant Christianity, in so far as this stands for a protest against the Paganizing of Primitive Christianity.

As already indicated, a great and funda- mental principle of human life constitutes the point of divergence between the two Great Parent Schools here referred to. Indeed, nothing less vital ever could have become an issue of such transcendent importance as to in- spire the segregation of humanity into two such powerful, organized, opposing forces. Moreover, perhaps the only fundamental principle of human life great enough, deep enough, broad enough and vital enough to in- cite humanity to a conflict of such extraordi- nary proportions and of so irrepressible a nature, is the sublime principle of Individual Liberty. Suffice it to say, this is the one vital principle at the foundation of the greatest struggle the world has ever known — the Struggle for Individual Liberty — otherwise U"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"THE LINEAL KEY known and designated as the Struggle for Happiness. The two Great Parent Schools have stood throughout the centuries and stand today dia- metrically opposed to each other upon the basis of principle, which underlies, and forms the subject matter of, this greatest of all hu- man struggles. As might readily be anticipated, the mo- tives which inspire these two powerful or- ganic forces to align themselves on opposite sides of the Struggle for Individual Liberty are equally different in character and wholly irreconcilable. One of these has been inspired to action by the most unselfish service for humanity; the other has been moved by the spirit of human greed and the desire for power. The one has exemplified the spirit of altruism; the other that of the most inordinate egoism. The one has sought to liberate men from the bondage of ignorance, superstition and fear; the other has cunningly played upon these infantile ele- ments of human nature to bind them the more securely to its cause. The one has striven through the potency and influence of knowl- 17"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE edge to break the shackles of unjust physical bondage, debasing spiritual domination, stul- tifying intellectual suppression, unwholesome moral oppression, enervating religious de- pendence and destructive psychical subjection ; the other has sought through the pliable in- fluence of ignorance to bind these chains yet more securely about the Souls of men, that it may the more easily and surely use them as the passive or willing instruments of its am- bition, vanity and greed. The one has sought to accomplish its mission of emancipation by the natural unfoldment of the Individual In- telligence through the expansive power of a broad, liberal and non-sectarian education, until men might be able to see, understand and appreciate the fact that individual hu- man liberty — physical, spiritual, intellectual, moral, religious and psychical — is an inalien- able and paramount duty of every intelligent Soul; the other has persistently and consis- tently opposed the development of any and all forms of education intended to liberate mankind from the bondage of superstition and fear — upon which alone it must depend for the successful enforcement of its assumed 18"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE LINEAL KEY authority over them. The one has been im- pelled to its task of liberation by the unerring consciousness that a knowledge of the truth alone can ever make men free, and that they must thus be made free before they can hope to find individual happiness here and here- after; the other, in like manner, has been im- pelled to its struggle against intellectual, moral and religious liberty by the same un- erring consciousness that such liberty, if per- mitted, would inevitably shatter its assumed authority over men and free them from its dominating power. The one points out a straight and narrow path whereby the indi- vidual who wills may bring his life, by his own personal effort, into perfect alignment with Nature's Constructive Principle, in all the departments of his being — the inevitable re- sults of which are the development within himself of an awakened consciousness of spiritual things and an independent, personal and scientific demonstration of the continuity of individual life; the other points out an easy, subtle and seductive way whereby the individual who will submit his life to its domination and unquestionably abide by its 19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE authority, has the comforting assurance that he may thus evade the Law of Personal Re- sponsibility and shift its consequences and its burdens from his Soul to the soulless organ- ism of which he is a member. From the foregoing statement of facts the thoughtful student will doubtless make his own analysis and draw his own conclusions. An intelligent application of the lineal key of relationships will furnish a clear and con- clusive answer to a number of important ques- tions which have commanded the interest and attention of students and thinkers in the re- lated fields of religion and philosophy all over the world. It has been observed, for instance, that be- tween Freemasonry and Protestant Christian- ity there plainly exists a strong and fraternal bond of sympathy and fellowship. This bond is so distinct and unmistakable as to suggest the existence of some possible esoteric kinship and lineal relation which might seem to be incompatible with the exoteric or outward po- sitions of these two organizations. It is a well- known fact, however, that Freemasonry is in no sense recognized as a \"Religion,\" within 20"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE LINEAL KEY the general meaning of that term. The limit of its own claim is that it is \"a Progressive Moral Science.\" It is generally regarded, however, as more truly representing a \"Moral Philosophy.\" Protestant Christianity, on the other hand, is distinctively a \"Religion of Faith,\" and is based upon certain fundamental dogmas which, considered as a whole, constitute what we are wont to recognize as a religion or a religious creed. The questions which so often arise in this connection are concerning the exact nature and real basis of this mysterious bond of sym- pathy and understanding between these two great bodies, the one representing a moral philosophy and the other a religion of faith. Why is it that these two organizations go hand in hand as concomitant factors and in- telligent forces in the defense of individual human liberty? Why is it that the one as a moral philosophy, and the other as a religion of faith, stand together as a unit in impeach- ing the authority of any organization or asso- ciation of men, either political or ecclesias- tical, that denies the right of individual"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE thought and individual conscience as inalien- able and indefeasible? The lineal key which unlocks the mystery of their common parentage furnishes a com- plete answer to these and many other ques- tions of equal interest and importance. It is because Freemasonry and Protestant Chris- tianity are the direct, organic, lineal descend- ants of the same progenitor, the \"Venerable Brotherhood\" of India — the Great Parent School of Individualism and Freedom — from which they have inherited the same undying love of individual human liberty."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER III THE GREAT SCHOOL The Great School of the Masters came into existence as a definite organic entity. The exact time of its birth as an organization is so remote that it is not within the range of historic certainty, and can there- fore truthfully be said to be prehistoric. The remoteness of its antiquity, however, may be safely assumed from the suggestion that it is said to have a record history of more than 100,000 years. If this be any- where nearly correct, it would seem justly to entitle the School to the designation of \"Ancient.\" Indeed, a record history of 10,000 years would establish sufficient antiquity for all practical purposes. During all the years of its existence, how- ever ancient that may be, it has been seeking the most propitious means of giving to hu- manity the benefits of its accumulated knowl- edge. To that end, it has developed many 33"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE individual Masters and inaugurated many different Movements. It has fostered each of them so long as it seemed to be accom- plishing the constructive purposes for which it was instituted. The Great School of the Masters — by whatsoever name it has been known in the world — is that great Central Source and Reservoir of Knowledge (Religious, Philo- sophical, Moral, Physical, Spiritual and Psychical) which the best intelligences of all ages have intuitively sensed and definitely ac- cepted as the great beneficent, constructive, uplifting and progressive influence in the Evolution of Mankind from Spiritual In- fancy and Darkness to Soul Maturity and Illumination. It is definitely known that at some remote period whence \"the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,\" The Great School of the Masters came into existence as a definite in- stitution. The exact modus operandi by which this was accomplished is not at all difficult to understand. One of the simplest powers of Spiritual Mastership has ever been that of mental"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE GREAT SCHOOL telepathy. By the exercise of this one power it is easily possible for one who possesses it to project his definite thoughts through space, to any distance, and to any other Indi- vidual Intelligence who has acquired the same power. Through the power of telepathy it was possible for the individual Masters of the remotest antiquity to communicate to each other their wishes and desires. By this method they first came into communication with each other, and later came together physically, at some convenient meeting place, for the purpose of organizing themselves into a definite Association. The primary purpose of such an Associa- tion was to enable them to learn from each other whatsoever was then possible concern- ing Life, Death, The Soul, Immortality, Evolution, Spiritual Life, Spiritual Master- ship and Human Destiny, many of which mysteries they had already solved, in their individual capacities. Can you think of anything more natural and inevitable than the simple fact that the individual Masters who were all seeking for 25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE knowledge concerning the same great Prob- lem of Life — should come together for the purpose of consultation, for the exchange of their knowledge, and for the consideration of ways and means of enlarging what they al- ready had? This was inevitable, just as the same results are always inevitable from the same causes. The first result was the organization of a definite School of Physical, Spiritual and Psychical Knowledge. The logical outcome of this Movement was the formulation of a definite curriculum of study whereby they could best transmit their knowledge to such students as might come to them for instruc- tion, duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified, and with right motives. The next logical step and objective point of the plans and purposes of such a School was to find ways and means of giving their knowledge — or such of it as would be of im- mediate benefit to humanity — to the world. Each individual Master and Member knew, from personal experience in the course of his own individual development to Mas- tership, that he had achieved success only by 26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE GREAT SCHOOL and through his exact compliance with Na- ture's laws, principles and processes. Let it be said, to the honor and glory of The Great School of the Masters, that it has ever stood for \"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\"; and that it ever and always has utilized its knowledge and exercised its powers for the constructive unfoldment of Individual Intelligence, in direct line with these beneficent principles and results. Inasmuch as The Great School of trje Masters is now, and throughout its entire life has been, a progressive School of Sci- ence in all the departments and on all the planes of Nature, it is not an archaic institu- tion that has become obsolete — through stag- nation or atrophy. It has been and is one of its fundamental purposes, to keep itself at all times abreast of the age and the time in which it lives. It is a progressive and modern School, always wide-awake and in the van- guard of scientific inquiry and knowledge. Simply because it is the oldest educational institution known to man is no reason that it has ever allowed itself to become \"static\" in any sense whatsoever. In truth, its very strong- 27"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE est claim upon the confidence and sympathetic consideration of humanity today is in the fact that it adjusts itself to the progressive conditions and demands of the immediate Present, and at no time allows itself to be- come dogmatic concerning those matters which, as yet, lie within the field of Specu- lation, and beyond the limits of its scientific knowledge. The foregoing will explain more fully, perhaps, than anything else that could be said, why it is that The Great School of the Masters is endeavoring to give its Instruc- tion to the world today through the agency of a New Movement, rather than to go on working, as best it might, through and in cooperation with, the various older Move- ments and efforts of the past. Let it be dis- tinctly understood by the reader, however, that it is not decrying, underrating, censur- ing, nor in any manner detracting from the merits of any of these Movements referred to. It is simply conforming to its own plan and method of procedure, in that it is seeking to make a right use of all the knowledge it possesses, at the present time, for the benefit 28"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE GREAT SCHOOL of mankind, while it is accumulating more knowledge that shall be of greater service in times to come.

On the other hand, it is con- vinced that, so far, it has accumulated but a comparatively small measure of the scientific knowledge that lies out beyond the limits of that which it has been able to gather during the comparative antiquity of its existence. But, although by comparison it may, as yet, be in the primary grade of the Great Uni- versal School, that fact does not deter nor hinder it from going forward with its work of accumulating more knowledge, as rapidly as possible, that it may be the better qualified and equipped to render a greater and better service to humanity, whenever and wherever the opportunity shall present itself. Neither does it anticipate nor expect that it will ever arrive at a point where there is nothing more to learn. 29"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE It recognizes the fact that knowledge, insofar as the human Individual is con- cerned, is one of the Ultimate: toward which humanity is moving, with all the room there is in which to continue its moving.

There are yet a number of others, but these will be sufficient to establish in the mind of the reader the fact that the name selected — The Great School of the Masters — is not a misnomer; but is a name of definite and historic value, as well as of tremendous significance, in that it embodies all that is in- cluded in the meanings of all the various names above designated, and all the definite knowledge that has reached the world from the Great Central Source to which these various designations and names have refer- ence.

In those ancient days, as in these modern ones, there were Advanced Souls who de- voted their lives and their efforts to a study of the Great Problems of Life, Death, the Soul, Human Destiny, Life After Death, and — Mastership. Then, as now, there were 33"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE the few exceptional Souls whose individual efforts were rewarded by greater knowledge of the Problems than were their fellows who devoted their efforts to the things of this purely physical earth.

There are \"Masters\" today, as truly as there have ever been at any time within the history of humanity. And these Modern Masters have solved as many of the Greater Problems as did the more ancient Masters of Egypt, Syria, Persia, India, and other civilizations. By personal experience they have solved the problem of the continuity of Individual Life beyond the grave; and have made many other discoveries that are, as yet, unknown to the masses of humanity. The Bible gives us Moses. The Zend- Avesta gives us Zoroaster. The life and teachings of the Masters, Buddha and Christna, are more or less familiar as a part of the sacred literature of all times. These 34"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MASTERS are but illustrations of the fact above stated, namely, that there were individual Mas- ters long before any of the many Schools of Mystery came into existence. Just how many thousands, tens of thousands, or hun- dreds of thousands of years back of the Schools of Mystery the first real Master lived on earth, is beyond the limits of accessible human knowledge today. Hence, it is but a waste of time and effort to speculate upon the subject. This is true of the great Oriental Masters, Christna and Buddha. It is equally true of the Persian Prophet and Master, Zoroaster. It is just as true of Confucius and Pythago- ras, respectively known as the Chinese Mas- ter and the Grecian (sometimes Egyptian) Master. It is likewise just as true of the Masters who have had their inspiration and their instruction concerning spiritual life and spiritual things, in the various Schools of the Ancient Mysteries. But here is a significant fact with which many of our best intelligences of today are not familiar, and it is of so vital a character 35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE that it is of supreme importance in this par- ticular connection. All these various Great Masters through- out the past, even down to the present time, were teaching virtually the same philosophy of life, the same religion, the same science — in just so far as they carried forward their individual work and demonstrations. This means that the Masters, Christna, Eliola, Melchizedek and Buddha, taught vir- tually the same philosophy of life, or religion, as Zoroaster, Confucius, Pythagoras, and later, the Master Jesus, taught. Perhaps it would be more literally accurate to say that these great Masters all developed their indi- vidual concepts of the Great Problem of In- dividual Life from knowledge which they obtained, directly or indirectly, from one or more of the various Schools of Ancient Mys- teries. For it appears that, whatever differ- ences have been noted in their individual conclusions are the results of mere differences in method rather than differences in sub- stance. Or, it may have been that these differ- ences were merely the results of the differing methods of these various Masters in their 36"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MASTERS efforts to adapt themselves to the various times and environments in which they lived, as well as the varying facilities they enjoyed for the transmission of their message to the humanity of their particular and respective times and generations.

They all were teaching only such actual knowledge as they had accumulated concerning the Great Problem — \"If a man die, shall he live again?\" The same is equally true of the various historic Masters of all times. The Master Christna did more, perhaps, than any other single Master to color the life and civilization of the entire Orient. And yet, his philosophy and teachings, which are somewhat voluminous, show that he was a great reformer whose life was devoted to a profound Moral and Spiritual Movement. Nevertheless, he was teaching the same gen- 37"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE eral philosophy of life as that of the other Great Masters who followed him. El tola was one of the earliest Masters to gain a place in the heart of a great Movement for the enlightenment of the world concerning the teachings and findings of The Great School of the Masters. For his great wisdom, loyalty, unflinching courage and determina- tion, he was chosen by his fellows as the offi- cial representative of The School to undertake the establishment of a definite branch in Egypt. He established himself at the city of Luxor, in the then existing center of Egyptian civilization, and began his work of teaching, to a few carefully selected and highly intelli- gent and influential citizens. His efforts were so successful that, in due time, the most potent rulers of Egypt become initiates and were under his instruction. The Master Melchizedek, despite his great importance as a High Priest who estab- lished the Priestly Order in his own name, gave to the world no detailed account of his life and work. But the single fact that Jesus was made \"an High Priest after the Order of Melchizedek forever,\" proves 38"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MASTERS the value and reverence in which the Mas- ter Melchizedek was held. Pythagoras, who received much of his schooling and knowledge of Spiritual Life from the School of Egyptian Mysteries, left the imprint of his constructive influence upon the civilization of Egypt from his own time forward, even to the present. His teachings and philosophy of life have been, and still are, a mighty inspiration to men of all subsequent ages who have been seeking to solve the Great Problem of the continuity of individual life. Socrates, another of the great Master Minds of history, also derived much of his knowledge of the same great problem from the Schools of Mystery, especially the Egyp- tian and the Eleusinian Schools. To him is generally conceded the development of the inductive method of reasoning; and the ex- alted moral value of his teachings registered itself upon his students — more especially Aristotle and Plato — and through them upon subsequent civilizations.

Their 39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE philosophy of individual life, more espe- cially in its exalted Moral Concepts, is clearly identified with the great Central Source of Spiritual Wisdom, The Great School of the Masters.

Buddha was another Great Master whose influence has colored all civilizations during, as well as subsequent to, that in which he lived.

For the Cause it represents he labored and suffered and died. At every step along the thorny pathway of his public ministry he gave unmistakable evi- dences that an essential part of his plan and mission and purpose was to educate a select group of men for the express purpose of en- abling them to carry forward the Great Work after he should have finished his earthly la- bors. Had he remained with them until their instruction and work of preparation were completed, the crowning purpose of his earth- ly ministry would have been accomplished.

That he should disappear at the interesting age of twelve, just at a time when he had made such a profound impression by confounding the learned doctors of Jerusalem, and reappear only at the age of thirty, is of itself a most re- markable incident. That he should disappear as a precocious child and reappear as a Mas- ter, is far more significant; for in this fact alone we have evidence of the most positive and conclusive character that the mysterious and unexplained interval of eighteen years was a period of the most vital importance, in that these were the years of his preparation for a public work. But when the further fact is known that the records of The Great School contain a detailed account of his work and life as a student of the Masters during that re- 43"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE markable interval of his preparation, another mystery is explained. Notwithstanding the possible errors of his historians, the inaccuracies of translators, and the mistakes and interpolations of revisers, the Gospels themselves contain many of the most significant links in the chain of facts which binds the Master Jesus to the Ancient School of India. In this connection it is also significant that John the Baptist immediately preceded him on his return, proclaimed his coming in terms of the most definite and unqualified character, and in his own way endeavored to prepare the public to receive him. All this is indisputa- ble evidence of his absence. It also bears spe- cific testimony to the fact that John was fully advised of his coming, that he also had defi- nite information as to the nature of his mission and the character of the work to be inaugu- rated by him, and that his return was an event of unusual importance.

The foregoing are a few of the individual Masters (there are many others) who arose, in the world's esteem, to the dignity of \"Mas- ters,\" and left the sublime influence of their lives and teachings upon the world. They were held by The Great School worthy to speak the great Message of Truth to the world, as far as they had received the In- struction. These were men, living upon the physical plane of life, subject to all the trials and handicaps of time, place, environment, cir- cumstance, and conditions of the social and moral development of the people in whose midst they labored and taught.

This disturbing fact will be more clearly understood, per- haps, when it is explained that the follow- ing named are but a comparatively few of the many possible sources from which the \"Ancient Mysteries\" have come down to us: The Eleusinian Mysteries, The Egyptian Mysteries, The Grecian Mysteries, The Phoenician Mysteries, The Magian Mysteries, The Persian Mysteries, The Gothic Mysteries, The Chaldean Mysteries, The Dionysian Mysteries, The Phrygian Mysteries, The Syrian Mysteries, 48"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE GREATER MYSTERIES The Etrurian Mysteries, The Indian Mysteries, The Druidical Mysteries, The Chinese Mysteries, The Bakshoe Mysteries, The Mythraic Mysteries, The Arabian Mysteries, The Zoroastrian Mysteries, The Pythagorian Mysteries, The Hebrew Mysteries, The Roman Mysteries, The Christian Mysteries, Etc., Etc.

Aside from what is definitely known of the Egyptian Mysteries, the Greek Mys- teries seem to have left the impress of their nature and purposes more distinctly upon the subsequent ages and civilizations.

There can be no doubt that initiation into the Mysteries, by whatever School it may have been, whether Egyptian, Eleusinian, Syrian, Phrygian, Magian, or any other of the many different Schools, was accom- panied by the most intense and vivid drama- tization. This is known to be true of the Egyptian, the Eleusinian, the Grecian and the Magian Schools of Mystery.

It is a concept that is as old as man himself.

The planting of the grain in the ground was the symbol of death. It marked the de- cay and death of the individual grain of corn. The sprouting from the grain into a living stock, bearing other grains, symbol- ized the resurrection of the dead into a new life.

There are others of more recent origin, with which the reader may be familiar.

The only reason for designating this great Movement \"Brahmanism,\" is in the fact that the early priesthood of that School first adopted the teachings of Christna, and de- voted their energetic efforts to its propaga- tion throughout all India. It spread rapidly and flourished because of the great purity of the Master's life and teachings, until it dom- inated the religious thought of all India. But slowly the deadly poison of Paganism began to make itself felt within the great body of the Brahmanical Priesthood.

And today Brah- manism stands for the Evil Genius, the Oc- topus of Devolution which is sucking the life-blood from the children of one of the greatest civilizations of earth. The Early Egyptian Movement: Many thousands of years before the dawning of the Christian Era the Masters in secret conclave assembled — at the Central Temple in India — decided that the time had come when it seemed both possible and wise to undertake the great work of establishing a definite branch of The Great School in Egypt. To that end \"Eliola,\" one of the Great Masters, was commissioned to direct the difficult un- dertaking. Under his personal supervision the Work was inaugurated. A School was established, and for more than 4000 years its influence was a potent factor in the cvolution- 70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE GREATER MOVEMENTS ary unfoldment of Egyptian civilization. Its wisdom and unfailing judgments became the solid foundation of government policies. Its science and its art became a natural basis for the loftiest ambitions, the most exalted achievements and the holiest inspirations of the Soul. Evidences of its science, art and re- ligion were wrought into enduring monu- ments which, even to this day, mark the up- ward pathway of Egyptian civilization and bear silent but eloquent testimony to the wis- dom and the work of the Great Masters. When the floodtide of Egyptian civilization had reached its height and the fatal ebb of national life began, a new School was born. This new School is that which, in modern times, has come to be known and designated as the \"School of Egyptian Black Magic,\" or the \"School of Black Art.\" Its votaries, filled with the spirit of selfishness, and consumed with the desire for material wealth, political preferment and power, knew that the wisdom of the Great Masters had guided the nation over the rough pathway to the summit of its splendor and power. They knew that the faith of the people in the guiding wisdom of 71"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE The Great School was established. They knew, therefore, that if they could but simu- late successfully the profound knowledge and powers of the Masters, they might thereby, through trickery and fraud, hope to gain con- trol of the state. This accomplished, they could thenceforth administer its powers and its material wealth to further their own selfish and ambitious purposes. To this end they openly and shamelessly proclaimed themselves members of The Great School. To substantiate their claims they per- formed tricks of legerdemain in public places to demonstrate their magical powers. By their clever tricks, cunning simulations and subtle falsehoods they blinded the eyes of the credu- lous multitudes and forced their way into the councils of the nation. Carefully measuring the credulity, the innocence and artlessness of the masses, together with their awe of and reverence for the miraculous, they began to invent the beautiful, seductive and elusive fic- tions which later found a place in what we of today know as \"Egyptian Mythology.\" Slow- ly and carefully, one by one, the fascinating mystical rites and ceremonials of early \"Pa- 72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE GREATER MOVEMENTS ganism\" were thus invented and solemnly in- augurated. Accompanied by a beautiful and artistic ritualism, they became an important part of the sensuous and idolatrous worship of the new School. Thus, upon the foundation of hypocrisy, selfishness, vanity, greed and the most deliberate falsehood, Egyptian Pagan- ism was reared as a powerful institution of human slavery. Ignorance and superstition superseded wisdom and virtue, and the School of Egyptian Black Magic — whose offspring is Paganism — triumphed over The School of the Masters. Intellectual bondage and spirit- ual darkness succeeded intellectual liberty and spiritual light. When this deplorable condition had become an established fact and the doom of the nation and its civilization had been irrevocably sealed, The Great School withdrew from Egypt, and by special edict not one of its members nor accredited students remained from whom the secret wisdom thereafter might be obtained in that country.

He established a Great Priestly Order which was infinitely higher and more impor- tant than the Priestly Order of Aaron; in that the Priesthood of Aaron was only a physical institution, and the authority of its priests ceased with their death; but the Or- der of Melchizedek was a Spiritual Order, and its priests were priests forever.

It would also explain, in some measure, why he came to be so exalted a figure, as the Su- preme Head of the Great Order which has come down through the distant ages in his own name — The Order of Melchizedek. Magianism: The ancient and original Magian Movement had its rise in Persia, as nearly as present information can determine, between 1000 and 2000 B. C. Shortly after its active work had begun to make a profound impression upon the in- telligent and influential minds of the time and country, its central headquarters in Egypt was established at Luxor.

It is now believed that here is the real source of the ritual employed by the School of Egyptian Mysteries, as well as much of the dramatic ceremonial of initiation into that School. The leaven of Magianism has had an im- portant influence in many countries and many Mystical Cults and Movements throughout the entire world, since it flour- ished abundantly in and throughout Egypt, and adjacent countries.

However new or sur- prising this suggestion may be, let it be said that no intelligent student of history will question the entire truth of the foregoing suggestions. According to the voluminous writings of our modern, Masonic historians, Speculative Masonry, though designating itself as \"An- cient, Free and Accepted Masonry,\" with its emphasis on the \"Ancient,\" is but a compara- tively modern institution, according to the dicta of its own accredited historians.

A definite inquiry among the leading Ma- sonic writers of today will disclose the in- teresting fact that the existence of this great central Source of Masonic Moral, Scientific, and Spiritual Knowledge and Wisdom is al- most universally acknowledged among the members of the Order of Speculative Ma- sonry everywhere.

It would seem rather important that this question should receive a direct and specific answer, if such an answer is obtainable with- in the definite range of present human knowledge. Operative Masonry, as that Order is re- ferred to in this volume, owes its existence directly to that Great Central Source — The School of the Masters.

Thus, it becomes clear to those who seek the Light of Truth, that The Great School of the Masters is the real Origin, or Source, from which Freemasonry emanated. The Birth of Operative Masonry occurred when The School of the Masters invested it with the \"Grand Masonic Word,\" otherwise designated as the \"Word of Instruction,\" and commissioned it to give that \"Word of In- struction\" to humanity.

The Plumb, Square, Trowel, and Level, the chief mechanical implements employed by Practical Masons, are all em- ployed by Operative Masonry in their ritual- istic ceremonies. The completed building, or Temple, is likewise employed as the most significant and beautiful symbol of all. These symbols are employed in Operative Masonry to symbolize the various virtues, moral pre- 117"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE cepts, or elements of human character. The Temple itself is the completed result of the combined efforts of all Masons working upon it with all the tools of their profession. What is more beautiful and appropriate than the concept that the completed Temple built by Practical Masons, is the symbol of human Character? It is the ideal which the Master Builder of Practical Masonry has in mind as the finished result of all the efforts of himself and all his fellow-workmen. When the Temple is completed, the Master Builder is happy in the realization of his ideal made manifest in material form. Every Operative Mason has in his mind an ideal Character toward which he is working all the time. But in one particular this sym- bol is not perfect, in the following respect: The Master Builder of a material Temple has the benefit of the assistance of all classes of Masons engaged with him in the prac- tical work of construction. Not so, however, with the Master Builder of the Temple of Human Character.

True, whenever he needs help in the formation of the Ideal of his own Char- acter, he may have the help of an Instructor, to crystallize his Ideal. And in all his work of building, he uses the symbols of the various working-tools em- ployed in the building of a material Temple. The Great School of the Masters embodies in its curriculum of study and personal work for the Student, or Initiate, a code of Moral Principles, far more rigid and complete than that of Blue Lodge Masonry — beautiful and wonderful as the foregoing shows it to be.

In a beautifully worded exposition of the meanings of these symbols, the Initiate is taught that the Twenty-four- inch Gauge is an instrument made use of by Practical Masons to measure and lay out their work. It, being divided into 24 equal parts, is emblematical of the 24 hours of the day, whereby the Initiate is taught to divide his Time into three equal parts, which he will endeavor to utilize as follows: Eight hours for the service of God and 120"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE ANCIENT PRINCIPLES worthy distressed Brothers; eight hours for his usual avocation; and eight hours for re- freshment and sleep.

The Common Gavel is an instrument made use of by Practical Masons to break off the rough corners of stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use; but through the appli- cation of its Moral Principle to himself, he is taught to divest his heart and conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting his Mind as a living stone in that Spiritual Building, that house not made by hands, eternal in the Heavens. Economy of Time and Industry are taught by The Great School of the Masters under the head of Personal Effort.

Caution. The Initiate is given a \"new name,\" that of \"Caution.\" He is instructed by the Mas- ter of the Lodge that inasmuch as he has been instructed, thus far, in the mere rudi- ments of Masonry, he should be very cau- tious over all his words and actions, espe- cially when in the presence of the enemies of Masonry.

The \"Check Word\" of Truth is given to the Entered Apprentice Mason as \"a divine attribute and the foundation of every virtue.\" The Great School defines it as \"the estab- lished harmonic relation which the facts of Nature sustain to each other and to the indi- vidual Soul of Man.\" In these differing ex- pressions of the same thing, may be observed one of the distinguishing facts which differ- entiates the methods of the two Orders, with- out in the least disturbing their meaning and purpose. The Great School would not even suggest that its own definition is one whit better than that of Masonry.

Generosity and Service. By a clever subterfuge the Initiate finds himself entirely destitute, and when the Mas- ter asks him to contribute something of me- tallic kind, as a memorial of his Initiation, he finds that he has absolutely nothing with him, and cannot even borrow so much as a button from his fellows in the Lodge. He is deeply humiliated and embarrassed by his helplessness. Then the Master says to him, in substance: \"Let this be a powerful lesson to you.

Uprightness. By the upright position and attitude in which he is then placed within the Lodge room, he is informed by the Master that he stands there a just and upright Mason; and he is admonished ever to walk and act as such.

It, therefore, fittingly symbolizes Mortality, that which cannot endure. The Level teaches him that all Masons stand together as Broth- ers upon the same level. As such, they thus exemplify the virtue of Equality, and in the Lodge room they always meet upon the Level, namely, upon a fraternal Equality. The Plumb admonishes him to live a life of Rectitude, to walk uprightly before God and Man, and hold himself no higher than his most lowly Brother. The Masters teach these same lessons in different forms.

This is because the Speculative Order of Freemasonry has not yet \"found\" the \"Lost Word\" of Instruction, through which alone it could possibly give the scientific instruc- tion necessary to accomplish the Spiritual Unfoldment.

One point should not be overlooked, with reference to Operative Masonry. It is this: As above stated, the Grand Word of Instruc- tion was withdrawn from Operative Ma- sonry, as such, that is, as a definite Organiza- tion, shortly before the Birth of Christianity. But it will be recalled that old Edinburgh Lodge No. 1, of Scotland, gives us evidence that, down as late as 1638, it was still an Operative Lodge; that it then still had the \"Word of Instruction\" and \"second sight.\" The question naturally arising in the mind of the reader is this: How could this be true after The Great School of the Masters had withdrawn the \"Word\" something more than 1000 years before? An important distinction must be made, to understand the situation correctly: 160"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE ANCIENT WORD When the \"Word\" was withdrawn, it was only withdrawn from the Order, as such, and not from the individual Lodges that had already received it and had proven them- selves worthy by complying with its teach- ings and doing the Work therein demanded of them.

With each succeeding dispensation, or new election of officers, its High Priest and Master were still actual \"demonstrators of the Law,\" and had received from their personal Instructors the \"Word,\" and under that \"Word\" had developed the \"second sight.\" Bear in mind that the \"Word of Instruc- tion\" was a personal instruction, delivered only \"from mouth to ear,\" and was never committed to writing, nor to any other ma- terial means of preserving it.

By this failure, they \"Lost\" the Word of Instruction, and all use of the spiritual senses resulting from its exemplification; and by its own gravity, the Lodge passed out of existence, as an Operative Body; and if it still retained its identity as a Lodge, it fell into the class of Speculative Masonry.

In each degree of our modern Speculative Or- der, in truth, such a Word is given the Ini- tiate when he is duly obligated as a Brother of that degree.

But if they believe in the truthfulness of Scripture, they should recall the historic fact that — \"When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the King, be- 179"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE hold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem.\" — Matt, ii, 1. Who were these \"Wise Men\"? And whence came they? Were they members of the Egyp- tian School of Magic, as some have claimed? And did they, therefore, come from the land of Egypt? The relative locations of Egypt and Jerusalem are, of themselves alone, a most direct and conclusive answer to all these questions. Egypt lies to the south and west of Jerusalem. They were, therefore, not from Egypt, for they were \"from the East\" — from the Orient. Is it not remarkable that Biblical students have taken so little note of the most significant phase of this most unusual incident? The mere fact that \"Wise Men\" came at all, or from any direction, at such a time, is of itself significant. For their coming is alone conclu- sive evidence of the remarkable fact that they were already acquainted with events leading up to the birth of Jesus, and understood the importance of his life and something of the nature of his mission. Why is it such evi- dence? Because they came \"to worship him.\" But as a key to his subsequent instruction it is 180"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"BIRTH OF CHRISTIANITY far more significant that these \"Wise Men\" came from the East.

The special importance of the foregoing is in the simple fact that these \"Wise Men\" came from the East. But this was inevitable, because at that time the central location of The Great School of the Masters was in the Orient, in India. And India is east from Jerusalem. These \"Three Wise Men\" were, in truth, none other than three Masters from The Great School. Through their prophetic vision they foresaw, long before the event itself occurred, that a Master was to be born at that time who would become the distinct and definite Representative of The School of the Masters, in a new World Movement, to deliver their Message of Life, Light and Immortality to the world.

To accomplish these preliminary necessi- ties, they set about developing an educational method of preparation for active and intelli- gent service as the true and worthy disciples of their Great Master. To this end, they provided a preliminary course of study, which was to give to the new disciple, or student, complete familiarity with every phase of the Master's teachings. When the Initiate had proven to his In- structors that he had become thoroughly proficient in this first step of his preparation for discipleship, he was required and per- mitted to enter upon, and proceed with, the second course of study, or degree, in his Ini- tiation.

The two most important centers of its development and influence, at this time, were Constantinople and Rome. It had now become apparent to its enemies that open hostility and direct opposition could never destroy it nor permanently check its progress. It was, in truth, a living and po- tential reality. Although it had come into being unbidden and unwelcomed, it had come with a vitality and a growing power which nothing could withstand. It was only when this had become a thor- oughly established fact that the skilful and subtle political trickery of Paganism began to manifest its power.

Inasmuch, however, as every symbol has at least two interpretations — exoteric and eso- teric — and no two esoteric symbolists agree in their esoteric interpretations of even the most simple and primitive symbols, the natural and inevitable result is just what we find today, namely, that the language of symbolism is utterly insufficient in deflniteness to serve as a reliable medium of expressing modern scien- tific thought. This twofold significance of the symbol is excused, rather explained, by the fact that Symbolism has ever been employed \"to con- 195"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE ceal, as well as to reveal,\" that which is sym- bolized. While there may be some virtue in this double standard of values, nevertheless, wherever the purpose is to reveal Truth, the individual is often confused by mystical in- terpretations of esoteric meanings. A Symbol is an object or thing which is used to express a definite idea or thought. A rose is an object which we have come to associate with, and expresses the idea of Love. Hence, when you are given the symbol of Love (a rose), the symbol carries with it the idea of Love; and you receive the symbol as expressing the idea of Love, and its gift means to you, Love. A beehive (because it is the home of one of the most active and industrious insects we know of) has become the symbol of \"Indus- try.\" Symbolism, therefore, when fully devel- oped, becomes a language for transmitting ideas and thoughts from one mind to another through the use of symbols (in the forms of definite objects) which represent the ideas and thoughts we desire to transmit to others. Although it became the primitive language 196"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"THE SYMBOLIST by means of which mankind first found it pos- sible to communicate their ideas and thoughts to each other, nevertheless, every language since then has continued to use symbols, to some extent, for the transmission of ideas from one mind to another.

But still it has its limitations, as a medium of conveying ideas and thoughts from one intelligence to an- other. The knowledge of humanity today has be- come so diversified, so vast in scope, so almost unlimited in variations and shadings of ideas and thoughts, that our adaptable symbols have long been exhausted. Indeed, history informs us that a purely symbolic language is sufficient only for man- kind in its most primitive development. The language of today is an evolution from the primitive language of symbolism; but it has evolved so far beyond primitive requirements that it has entirely outstripped all symbolic language because of its lack of versatility and efficiency in expressing ideas and thoughts. 197"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE History proves to us that symbolism, as a language, is fatally defective as a means of transmitting ideas and thoughts.

It has the example of the Christian Re- ligion as a guide by which to measure the fatal destructiveness of \"Interpretation.\" Thus, the Great School of the Masters, in the background of Natural Science, has sought to correct the mistakes and weaknesses of all former efforts to convey the Instruc- tion to humanity.

They accepted his unquali- fied statements and dogmatic assertions, to- gether with his beautiful imagery, as an ex- pression of his unqualified personal knowl- edge.

Suddenly his friend said to him: \"I am more deeply grateful to you for that sermon than I can ever tell you, and I want to thank you for it from the bottom of my heart.

The ancient Philosophy of Individual Life continually reminds man that it is the life here which determines the life there. It is the motive here which deter- mines the habitation there. It is the act here which evokes recompense or penalty upon a Soul in the spiritual life. It is the foundation here which supports the superstructure there.

Especially is this true among the general av- erage of human life upon the earth plane, and still more so among those below that average level of Intelligence and moral development. This infantile state and condition of hu- manity on the earth plane, only means that the evolution of Individual human life upon this planet begins with the lowest form of the 313"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Individual human upon the planet.

In point of evolutionary status, the first spiritual plane is one distinct round of attainment above and beyond the purely physical, and is exerting its uplifting influence constantly upon the physical, to draw it upward in the scale of evolution. The second spiritual plane sustains an analogous relation to the first, and is exerting its evolutionary influence upon the second, and through the second upon the physical. The same analogy holds good with all the higher planes of spiritual life, and they all exert their uplifting influ- ence upon all the planes below them, and through these upon the plane of the physical. Whilst this produces a powerful influence upon the physical plane, impelling and in- spiring men and women of the highest and most advanced Intelligence upon the earth plane to put forth the personal effort in the direct line of evolutionary unfoldment — it must not be overlooked that the very largest percentage of human life upon the physical 114"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"THE MODERN MOVEMENT plane lies far below the level of Intelligence necessary to receive this conscious impulse to obey the Universal Law of Evolution, and make any conscious personal effort to obey it.

Nature alone has planted the leaven which, in due time, lifts each and every Individual upon the physical plane upward to a conscious recognition of the Great Law of Individual Evolution. From this point of development the Individ- ual begins to recognize not only the Law itself, but the fact that Morality underlies, and fixes upon the Individual human the respon- sibility to align his Life with the Constructive Principle back of all Individual Evolution.

In this country the conditions have been somewhat different. The purely physical School of the Masters consists of exactly 33 members (when its phys- 317"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE ical roster is full). At the present time there are but 32 members upon the physical plane, and there is one vacancy to be filled whenever The School finds the right man who is duly and truly prepared, worthy and well quali- fied, and who is willing to take the instruction, make the demonstration of his Mastership, and assume the responsibilities which every chosen member must assume and be prepared to discharge to the uttermost. The number 33 has been selected, among other things, because it complies with one of the vital principles of Nature with reference to human life. There are in Nature just 33 distinct and individual lines of human en- deavor; and the School is builded upon the concept that it should provide the means and the facilities which enable it to give to its chosen members a finished and complete edu- cation upon the physical plane.

Throughout the history of The School of the Masters, it has held the interesting con- cept that each and every normal Individual human is, in miniature, a complete replica of the entire universe. This has been expressed in various ways. \"The Creator of the Uni- verse is the Macrocosm and Man is the Microcosm.\" This conveys the suggestion that Man, as an Individual Intelligence, con- tains within himself the essence of the entire universe; and he is often spoken of as the \"Microcosm\" or \"little world\", containing within himself alone a complete and perfect epitome of the \"Macrocosm,\" or \"greater world\" — the Universe. On this basis it will be observed that The Great School of the Masters is a sort of \"Mezzanine\" world between the Macrocosm and the Microcosm — between the Great Cre- ative Intelligence, or the God of the Uni- verse, and Man. With its 33 members it has equipped itself with one representative for each department of human endeavor, and 319"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE qualified itself to instruct mankind in every phase of Individual Evolution. The Great School, many thousands of years ago, promulgated the definite concept that — \"The proper study of mankind is Man.\" Man, being the Microcosm, contains within himself all the elements of the Uni- verse; hence, all there is of value in the Uni- verse of knowledge. By a \"proper study\" of himself he attains to the evolutionary status of Self-Completion, and earns Nature's inevit- able reward therefore, which is Individual Completion and Happiness. The Great School of the Masters, as such, is composed of 33 Individual units, or mem- bers, each of which is a Microcosm in the physical form of a human Individual — and all of which, taken collectively, constitute a vastly greater Individuality wherein each dis- tinct line of human endeavor is represented by a Microcosm, or \"little world\", a human member.

He knows that he has no moral right to assume or attempt to discharge the duties and respon- sibilities that are specifically assigned to any other representative, or worker in the Great Cause.

Neither is it possible for any one Member of the School to break down the bars of protection around any other Member, or expose him to the approach of those who have not absolutely proven their right to know him.

If a line were drawn from the eastern coast of Florida directly east across the At- lantic Ocean, it would strike the west coast of Europe. Another line from there at a right angle directly south, would strike the northwest corner of Africa. From there a line run directly west across the Atlantic would strike the eastern coast of Brazil, South America. Thence, a line directly north would come back almost to our starting point on the eastern coast of Florida, U. S. A.

Its north- east boundary came within about the same distance of the western coast of Europe. Its southeast boundary came within about the same distance of the northwest coast of Africa; and its southwest boundary almost touched the present coast of Brazil, South America. From these outlines, it will be observed that the entire continent of ATLANTIS almost filled the Atlantic Ocean between North America, Europe, northwest Africa, and Brazil, in the northeast corner of the conti- nent of South America.

It is clear, from all the available informa- tion at present, that the continent of ATLAN- TIS, during the last 10,000 years before its submergence, was as thickly inhabited as our own country at the present time, if not more so. This would have given it a population of many millions, not less than 100,000,000. The records of the Masters contain the evidences of a most progressive state of civil- ization, for many centuries before the conti- nent was submerged. The fact of the existence of the continent of ATLANTIS is attested by both tradition and historic reference by many of the Wise Men of past history. It was Plato, who, in his \"TlMAEUS,\" represents an Egyptian priest as describing the continent to Solon. According to this account, Atlantis was referred to as a great island, larger than Libia and Asia Minor combined. It was stated that nine thousand years before the time of Solon, it 335"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE had been a powerful nation. There is a radi- cal discrepancy, however, as to dates, between the above statement and that of the records of the Masters. For, the latter place the sinking of ATLANTIS at about 23,000 years ago.

This, however, was more than 10,000 years after the submergence of the continent. Whilst this would seem to raise a vital ques- tion as to the actual time when the continent sank, nevertheless, the writer is inclined to give the preference to the records of the Masters. And this because these records have been found so very authentic and reliable with reference to many other historic events and facts. It is well known by navigators and geol- ogists, that new islands are arising above the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, as well as elsewhere, constantly. It is likewise true that individual islands have been known to disappear beneath the surface of the waters.

The Bahama and the Canary Islands are both clearly within the area originally occu- pied by the continent of Atlantis.

This is indicated by the fact that the government was a Republic, under the direct influence of the School of the Masters, and in harmony with the ethical principles of that Great Ancient School. Atlantis was eminently an agricultural country; and its products were as varied as are those of our own country, or of Brazil, or any of the European countries, or Mexico. Corn, wheat, barley, rye, oats, oranges, ba- nanas, grapes, and various other fruits, were cultivated in great abundance.

The records of the Great School inform us that for more than three years immediately prior to the disappearance of the continent beneath the waves of the ocean, the Wise Men among the Masters had almost certain knowledge of the approaching cataclysm. During those three years, it is said, there were many violent earthquakes, indicating the un- stable foundations upon which the continent rested.

That is the continent of \"Lemuria\" — sometimes called the \"Land of Mu,\" which existed as early as 50,000 years ago.

The School of the Masters tells us that there was such a continent as above described, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean (as we now know that vast body of water). The history of that continent goes back more than 100,000 years. The continent, during that time, was almost devoid of high mountain peaks and ranges. It was composed of low rolling hills and wide verdant valleys and level plains. It was eminently an agricul- tural country, as we of today would designate it. Cereals, vegetables, berries and fruits of many varieties were native to the soil; and were cultivated in great abundance by the inhabitants of the continent, during all those early years, even down to the great disaster which resulted in the sinking of the continent. We are told that the natives of this conti- nent were white, and possessed splendid and handsome physical bodies, and a high degree of intelligence. Among them were men whom they regarded as \"Masters,\" and to 360"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"LEMURIA whom they looked, and upon whom they de- pended, for their own knowledge of life. These Masters formulated for them the ethi- cal principles by which they governed their individual lives, as well as their relations with their fellows.

This led forward to the develop- ment of a general system of Education under which the citizens of the country became the most enlightened people of earth. There can be little doubt that what we call \"physical science\" had advanced, along some lines, to a point equal to that of the highest civilizations of today; and in the study and solution of the great \"Problem of Life,\" namely, the problem of continuity of individual life after physical death, their best minds had gone far beyond the point at- tained by the masses of humanity today.

There can be little doubt that the survivors of the great cataclysm, which resulted in the submergence of Lemuria, found their way to other lands. However, it is said that there were certain high lands, or points of land, which were not entirely submerged; and that these unsubmerged portions, together with such lands as have since emerged from the depths of the Ocean in that area, constitute the many islands and groups of islands now to be found within the area of the Pacific Ocean formerly occupied by the great conti- nent of Lemuria. On one of these islands alone, containing only about 90 square miles, there have been found — and can be seen by those of today who have the interest or curiosity to make the voy- age, and explore the island — more than 500 \"carved stones, colossal statues\" and many other artistic evidences of a lost, but mighty, prehistoric civilization. The largest human image to be found upon this island (called \"Easter Island,\" and situated near the south- east section of what is today known as \"Poly- 3<3"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"LEMURIA nesia\") is still in one of the ancient stone- quarries, where it was carved and from which — for some reason not definitely known today — it was never removed. This image is 70 feet high, and is of such enormous weight that it is doubtful if the 'best intelligence of today could devise a practical method by which it might be lifted.

Truth was not destroyed nor lost to the world. Therefore, Socrates did not live in vain. He did not die in vain. The Truths his teachings promulgated to the world not only ran the Gantlet of his own time, but continued their unvarying course throughout subsequent his- tory, even to the present time. History tells us that the Great Teacher Zoroaster met a violent death at the hands of the enemies of his teachings. And this not- withstanding that his entire Teachings were expressed in \"good thoughts, good words and good deeds.\" Another victim who gave his life that Truth might continue to live. The Master Buddha (Gautama Buddha) had the same general experience. He also 379"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE met the enemies of Truth and suffered greatly from their selfish and unscrupulous opposi- tion and antagonism; but his life was a noble triumph for Truth, based on the fundamental principles of Temperance and Self-Control. Confucius was a Master and a Teacher who confined his teachings to Ethics and politics. But his broad, democratic mind and great in- fluence made for him many enemies among politicians and men of philosophic and re- ligious views. He avoided religious contro- versy; but his enemies so misrepresented and persecuted him that his later years were spent traveling from place to place, without home or comforts, driven out of society. He was known as \"a man of sorrow,\" because of his grief over the failure to command the friend- ship, sympathy and affection of his people to whom his life was devoted. It is said that he died of a broken heart, because of his disap- pointment and sense of failure in bringing the Message of the Masters to his people. Thus Truth again ran a Gantlet. There is nothing, perhaps, which erects a more impregnable wall against Truth than the smug assumpti on of superior ity which is, 380"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"THE GANTLET OF TRUTH in its essential nature, not receptive to any offering which may, by interpretation, sug- gest greater knowledge, or more modern dis- coveries of Truth, than the intended receiver already possesses. This unfortunate characteristic of human nature prevailed not alone in the time of Jesus, but has existed from the infancy of the human race to the present time. It is with us today, perhaps not quite as prominently, as aggressively and as destructively, as it was during the Master's Life and Ministry, in the days of Herod the king, but enough to make hard the way of Truth. It will be remembered, by those who are at all familiar with Biblical history of the Chris- tian movement that, from, the very beginning of the Master's work, there were those who, by cunning, cleverness, and false pretenses, found their way, not only into the general membership of his disciples, but also into his inner circle of close personal workers, whom he made his Apostles, those he sent out to gather in the \"lost sheep of the house of Is- rael.\" Matt. x:6. One of these is said to have been \"Judas 381"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE Iscariot.\" If Scriptural history can be relied upon, this same Judas Iscariot is the man who betrayed Jesus into the hands of his enemies in Judea. IF this man was of the character generally attributed to him, he was ambitious and a seeker after leadership among his fel- lows. He was small of Soul and jealous of all who might stand in the way of his enjoyment of power, and personal preferment with the Master. No epoch in human history more clearly brings to our knowledge the seemingly nat- ural tendency of the human Intelligence to look upon Truth as an enemy to human prog- ress, than does that which embodies the Life and Teachings of the Master Jesus. In the Bible we are given a potent illustra- tion of the Gantlet which Truth must ever run in its effort to reach humanity. In this case the obstruction was the result of Ignor- ance and a lack of understanding of the sub- lime principles of Temperance and Self- Control which the Master Jesus so consist- ently taught and exemplified. \"For John the Baptist came neither eating 382"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"THE GANTLET OF TRUTH bread nor drinking wine; and ye say — 'He hath a devil.' \"The Son of man is come eating and drink- ing; and ye say — 'Behold a gluttonous man, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.' \" Luke vii :33, 34. According to the Scriptural narrative, The Master Jesus spoke the foregoing words to certain Pharisees and Lawyers who, having heard of the many cures Jesus had wrought among the multitudes who came to listen to him, came to meet him and question him. It is evident that they came in a critical attitude of mind, rather with the idea of confounding him with their cleverness, than to receive greater knowledge. The Master, having correctly read their purpose, turned the effects of their efforts back upon themselves. He pointed out to them the fact that when John the Baptist had come among them, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, these same Pharisees and Law- yers had said : \"He hath a devil.\" But when Jesus himself had come among them, both \"eating and drinking,\" these same Pharisees and Lawyers called him \"A glut- 383"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"THE GREAT MESSAGE tonous man, a wine-bibber, a friend of pub- licans and sinners.\" Was not this a richly deserved rebuke from the Master? In the one case, they had de- clared that John had a devil, just because he neither ate nor drank while among them; and they called Jesus \"a gluttonous man, a wine- bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners\" — just because he did eat and drink while among them. This was a perfect case of an Individual being condemned regardless of his Principles. Through ignorance he was condemned if he practiced Self-Control in not \"eating and drinking\"; through lack of understanding he was condemned if he exemplified Tem- perance in \"eating and drinking.\" But they failed to accomplish their pur- pose. Before they withdrew, they knew that the Master had seen through their attempted subterfuge, and had noted their utter and ridiculous inconsistency. And the Master was, at the same time, call- ing the attention of his hearers to the most difficult Gantlet which Truth must ever and always run, through the double lines of its 384"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"THE GANTLET OF TRUTH enemies. They array themselves in double lines, armed with every weapon they can pos- sibly employ for the purpose of destroying Truth, as it runs the straight path through Nature to Nature's God. The pity of it all is in the fact that he was but giving expression to a tendency of human nature, throughout the ages : the tendency of a large percentage of mankind, to make the way of Truth as difficult and as slow as pos- sible. We might go on and on indefinitely, telling the tragic story of \"The Gantlet of Truth,\" and we would find that history has repeated itself throughout every age, in every clime, and in every nation upon the face of the earth. Every effort the School of the Masters has ever made has been met and fought by the same class and character of enemies. Every World Movement the Masters have estab- lished and fostered throughout the past his- tory of human endeavor, has had its enemies who have sought to destroy whatsoever they could not dominate or control.

It is a profound comfort to know that The Truth which emanated from the Great School of The Masters, is the same Truth which has come down to us through every constructive movement throughout the remotest human history. During all the past ages, the Great School has been preserving, accumulating and increasing its knowledge, and handing it down to the humanity of every age, through the many and various constructive movements inaugurated and fostered by it. It is this same knowledge, with all its increasing accumula- tions, which comes down to those of us today who can prove to the Masters that we are duly and truly prepared, worthy and well qualified to receive it and use it only for the benefit of humanity, and then pass it on to those who 386"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"THE GANTLET OF TRUTH shall follow us and assume the same respon- sibilities.

The time is coming, and if we may judge by the accumulating evi- dences, it is not so very far distant, when the ever-increasing volume of Truth will sweep every obstruction of error before it and come down to the humanity of the near future, with the benediction of the Great Father, the Great Masters and the Great Universal In- telligence.
