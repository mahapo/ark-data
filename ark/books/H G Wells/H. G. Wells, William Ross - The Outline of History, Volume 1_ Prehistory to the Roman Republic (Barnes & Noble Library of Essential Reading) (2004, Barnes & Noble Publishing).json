WELLS CONFERRED UPON THE OUTLINE OF HISTORY A SUBTITLE—”Being a PlainHistory of Life and Mankind”—that is probably more indicative than the maintitle of what the work really is. For to call a work of over one thousand pagesand five hundred thousand words an “outline” betrays our common notion of theterm. But if “plain” means plainly or clearly written so a general reader canunderstand it, and if “life and mankind” means it is a history of the beginningsof life on Earth and the subsequent development of the social, political, andeconomic history of the highest life form—then we have a pretty fair descriptionof Wells’ endeavor. Written over an amazingly short period of time in 1918-1919by a highly successful English man of letters, The Outline of History caught onfirst in Britain and America and then throughout the rest of the literate world,selling in its first decade over two million copies, to highly enthusiasticprofessional reviews. Wells had started a craze that lasted throughout the 1920sfor copycat “outlines” on every conceivable subject. Coming right after thecarnage of World War I, the Outline was neither unduly pessimistic and cynicalabout the human condition nor Pollyannaish about humanity’s future. Instead, itpretended to offer an account of the development of the world’s civilizations upto the present, trying to convince its readers that an enlightened futuredepended on a clear, unprejudiced view of the past. Many readers must have beenconvinced. Even twenty years after its initial publication, when it was in itssixth edition, The Outline of History and its author were well enough known thatin the film The Maltese Falcon, Sidney Greenstreet’s malevolent character cantell Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) that the story of the Falcon is true, though hewill not find it in “Mr. Wells’ History.”H. G. Wells was by 1918 perhaps the best-known writer in the English-speakingworld. His name may still be the most recognizable of any author’s of hisgeneration, thanks mostly to his enduringly popular science-fiction novels, suchas The War of the Worlds (1898). Novelist, polemicist, scientific popularizer,journalist, socialist, futurist, and advocate of world government, birthcontrol, and other “progressive” measures, H. G. Wells had raised himself fromhumble beginnings to a life of international celebrity and financial success.Born in 1866, he achieved early success with his science-fiction romances, andby 1918 had solidified that popularity and increased his literary reputationwith such serious realistic novels as Tono-Bungay (1909). Wells was largelyself-taught though he had attended a teacher’s college where he studied underthe great T. H. Huxley, Darwin’s so-called “bulldog,” the most prominent publicapologist for the theory of evolution. Like his mentor, Wells was an unabashed“progressive,” convinced that the world could be understood without recourse torevelation or mythical narratives, that science ultimately could explain thematerial world, and that a dispassionate “scientific” attitude toward humanendeavor was actually essential for prosperity and, as years went on, even forthe survival of the species. Occasionally Wells’ fame lapsed into infamy, for hewas something of a philanderer, fathering at least two children out of wedlock,one by the novelist Rebecca West rather quietly, and the other not so quietly byAmber Reeves, the young daughter of a fellow Fabian socialist. When Wells diedin 1946, there was almost universal agreement that, in the words of DoraRussell, the philosopher Bertrand Russell’s much younger second wife, Wells hadbeen, along with George Bernard Shaw and her husband, one of the “greatemancipators from Victorian orthodoxy.”Why then did Wells write The Outline of History? Certainly not because heforesaw the immense financial bonanza it would become for him. In fact, he wason a mission. If future conflagrations like the Great War were to be avoided, afundamental reordering of the political system had to be undertaken. The worldwould have to adopt an international system far more radical than WoodrowWilson’s proposed League of Nations. And mankind could only unite in such asystem if it had a better idea of its common history. A “universal” history, asWells called it, would break down the old nationalistic, ethnic, and racialdivisions by plotting, from the beginnings of the planet, the human race’scommon heritage. This may sound far too utopian, but Wells’ realism should bestressed. He did not think a “magic bullet” was found in history. Instead, hethought of history with its progression of thought and possibility of beneficialaction as essential if humanity were to advance. In short, history willemancipate (to use Dora Russell’s word) one from mere sectarian or localprejudices and provide an enlightened review of humanity’s possibilities to helpshape a better future.To further guarantee that The Outline of History would have the desired impact,the amateur Wells enlisted many experts to help him. His biggest aid wasprobably the magnificent eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, awork that remained justly famous as far superior to both its predecessoreditions and its successors throughout most of the century. Wells lists overfifty specialists in his introduction, and to the principal four he provided notonly handsome remunerations but also the honor of having their names listed onthe title page (following “with the advice and editorial help of ”). Wells wasjustifiably proud of his omnivorous knowledge, however he was not only humbleenough to seek advice, but shrewd enough to supply his volumes the extrapedigree that only professional and renowned scholars could provide.What then did the early readers of the Outline find when they opened the firstvolume of Mr. Wells’ latest work? What they did not find was another version ofwhat Wells called the King and Country history, his term for the narrowlynationalistic (and chauvinistic) history taught in the schools. For Wells, thiskind of history, with its emphasis on one country’s “heroes” and battles andaccomplishments, was part of the problem. Indeed in the first volume of theOutline, the original British and American readers found a history that beganlong before their respective nations came into existence. Readers might havebeen used to such a looking back, but only in a limited way. If they were betterschooled they would expect to find a treatment of classical Greece and Rome andof biblical history. The not-so-well-trained would only be aware of some Biblestories. In the Outline they found both classical and Old Testament historycovered, to be sure, but placed within a much wider scope. The Greeks werepicked up, for example, when their ancestors first ventured onto the Balkanpeninsula. And their ancestors were traced back to their first arrival inEurope. The Hebrews were made to share their geographic territory with all theother peoples of the region, and their relative unimportance at the time wascarefully noted.In short, Wells insisted on a far different idea of historical contextualizationthan had usually obtained in the past. The reader would not only find more spacegiven to the ancient civilizations that came into contact with the Greeks andHebrews, but also to civilizations completely remote from them. Thus Chineseculture is given its due, and Confucius comes off as one of the most admiredethical teachers of the early period—as does Buddha. And Asoka (264-227 BC), anIndian ruler whom Wells says is the first leader to abandon warfare as a tool ofstate, is valued and honored as perhaps no other political leader in the entirevolume.One might expect that Wells, a freethinker when it came to religion, would usethe occasion to attack religion or specifically Judeo-Christian beliefs. Butnothing could be further from the truth. First he sees the rise in prehistorictimes of a “priestly class” as one of the great moments in the advance ofcivilization, for they are the first “writing class,” the first “readingpublic.” Any convincing explanation of the purpose and potential of mankindwould have to start with this. And with Christianity, Wells masterfully combinesthe latest skeptical biblical scholarship with an appreciation of the moralsaneness of Jesus and the intellectual rigor of St. Paul. As for the Jews, theyare central to his story of “progress,” for with them, “the ideas of the moralunity of mankind and of a world peace had come into the world.”Wells, as we have noted, does insist that the ancient Hebrews were far lessimportant in their world than any recent opinion would have. He has the sametendency to place classical civilization in its diminished place, doubtless inpart as a reaction to its too-exclusive centrality in liberal arts education,especially in England. But it is within Greek civilization that Wells finds hisfirst true hero—i.e., the first man who could have brought about the kind ofuniversal government that Wells thought the world was tending to or needed tomove toward. Unfortunately, like Julius Caesar a few hundred years later,Alexander the Great proves less than adequate to the task thanks to characterdefects, and the readers are witness to what undoubtedly was an unexpectedlyharsh assessment of the Macedonian conqueror.In short, the first readers of The Outline of History would have found a farmore tempered treatment of the civilizations most invoked in their own time asexamples of exemplary accomplishments and moral vigor. And they would have foundperfectly alien civilizations and belief systems—many of whose moderndescendents or adherents were now under European colonial control—treated withrespect and often ranked as more important than their own Western culturalancestry.But the first readers would also have found that Wells thought it necessary forthem to know far more than the story of ancient and potent civilizations. It wasnecessary to know something of the beginnings of the planet and of life itself.Thus the Outline opens with The Earth In Space and Time, which tries to give thereader some sense of the vastness of the universe, followed by chapters andsubchapters on the origins of life, the evolution of life from single-celledorganisms up through reptiles to mammals to early man. The chapters are proofthat Wells was a science-minded thinker in his own right and believed that abasic knowledge of science was necessary for a “world citizen,” as he might putit. Still, one might question how necessary this is for a history of humanendeavors. But any debate on that point would obscure the sense of empowermentthis material could give to the first readers.We have been inundated for so long with “Big Bang” theories and popular filmsabout dinosaurs and documentaries on cave-paintings and the like that we tend toforget that just about all the knowledge represented by these topics is quiterecent. Wells himself was born while most of the great innovators in geology,astronomy, paleontology, biology, physics, anthropology, and philology werestill alive. At least in the broad outline we are reading material today that isjust as valid as it was supposed to be in 1920. But readers in the 1920s wereexamining material that in 1820 was in its entirety almost completely unknown.Surely that first generation of readers of The Outline of History felt a senseof intellectual pride and even ownership that we can only guess at—surely theyfelt far more inclined to follow Mr. Wells in his search for a better world whenthey saw how much the human mind was capable of reconstructing, recuperating, ortheorizing.It is much the same with Wells‚ treatment of his scholarly “co-authors.” Untilthe fourth edition, Wells not only put their names on the title page, butallowed them to argue with him in the footnotes. This has the effect of lettinghis readers understand the nature of intellectual inquiry: It proceeds bydebate, not by fiat. And the mere fact that Wells does not change the text toconform to expert opinion indicates his continuing disagreement. Such editorialbehavior, one would suspect, is empowering, as it shows that the common man canargue with experts. After all, it is unreasonable to expect the ordinary readerto retain many of the names, dates, and events that inevitably assault the brainwhen reading a rapid-fire history like the Outline. If the reader emerged fromthe experience more tolerant, more aware of a vast scope of time and culturesoutside his own, and with the confidence that he could play a significant andintelligent part on the world stage, then Wells surely would have achieved hisgoal.With the passing of time, it is fair to ask whether there was anything thatWells, his first readers, and his first reviewers did not notice that we mightfind offensive or at least insensitive today. The answer is yes, and the problemlies where one probably would have guessed. In spite of Wells’ “universalizing”tendencies and his attempt to avoid privileging certain Western traditions, heis still a child of the West, and he clearly displays a Eurocentric bias even ishis treatment of early man, where far more attention is paid to the ancestors ofmodern Europeans than to those of other groups. And he is equally prejudiced infavor of the Indo-European family of languages (the group which includes almostall European languages, ancient and modern). This not only proves that Wells andhis uncomplaining readers and reviewers were products of their time, it alsoshows how “science” can mislead. For in both these endeavors, Wells wasdependent on the very scholars he had sought out to keep him from error. Thesection on the “languages of man,” for example, is almost wholly derived fromthe Britannica, and represents current or nearly current—the field was fastchanging—thinking and methodology on the subject.But there is no reason to read The Outline of History to find these historical“slips” or diminish Wells’ accomplishment. It is far more rewarding to read thework in its first edition for the enjoyment and knowledge it still brings, andat the same time to intuit the wonder and respect many ordinary readers insearch of enlightenment must have felt as they worked their way through Mr.Wells‚ emancipating history of life and mankind.

Wells’ World Reborn: The Outline of History andits Companions (2002) and many other studies of twentieth century literature andculture."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONA philosophy of the history of the human race, worthy of its name, must beginwith the heavens and descend to the earth, must be charged with the convictionthat all existence is one—a single conception sustained from beginning to endupon one identical law.—FRIEDRICH RATZELTHIS OUTLINE OF HISTORY, OF WHICH THIS IS A THIRD EDITION, FRESHLY revised andrearranged, is an attempt to tell, truly and clearly, in one continuousnarrative, the whole story of life and mankind so far as it is known today. Itis written plainly for the general reader, but its aim goes beyond its use asmerely interesting reading matter. There is a feeling abroad that the teachingof history considered as a part of general education is in an unsatisfactorycondition, and particularly that the ordinary treatment of this “subject” by theclass and teacher and examiner is too partial and narrow. But the desire toextend the general range of historical ideas is confronted by the argument thatthe available time for instruction is already consumed by that partial andnarrow treatment, and that therefore, however desirable this extension of rangemay be, it is in practice impossible. If an Englishman, for example, has foundthe history of England quite enough for his powers of assimilation, then itseems hopeless to expect his sons and daughters to master universal history, ifthat is to consist of the history of England, plus the history of France, plusthe history of Germany, plus the history of Russia, and so on. To which the onlypossible answer is that universal history is at once something more andsomething less than the aggregate of the national histories to which we areaccustomed, that it must be approached in a different spirit and dealt with in adifferent manner. This book seeks to justify that answer. It has been writtenprimarily to show that history as one whole is amenable to a more broad andcomprehensive handling than is the history of special nations and periods, abroader handling that will bring it within the normal limitations of time andenergy set to the reading and education of an ordinary citizen. This outlinedeals with ages and races and nations, where the ordinary history deals withreigns and pedigrees and campaigns; but it will not be found to be more crowdedwith names and dates, nor more difficult to follow and understand. History is noexception amongst the sciences; as the gaps fill in, the outline simplifies; asthe outlook broadens, the clustering multitude of details dissolves into generallaws. And many topics of quite primary interest to mankind, the first appearanceand the growth of scientific knowledge for example, and its effects upon humanlife, the elaboration of the ideas of money and credit, or the story of theorigins and spread and influence of Christianity, which must be treatedfragmentarily or by elaborate digressions in any partial history, arise and flowcompletely and naturally in one general record of the world in which we live.The need for a common knowledge of the general facts of human history throughoutthe world has become very evident during the tragic happenings of the last fewyears. Swifter means of communication have brought all men closer to one anotherfor good or for evil. War becomes a universal disaster, blind and monstrouslydestructive; it bombs the baby in its cradle and sinks the food-ships that caterfor the non-combatant and the neutral. There can be no peace now, we realize,but a common peace in all the world; no prosperity but a general prosperity. Butthere can be no common peace and prosperity without common historical ideas.Without such ideas to hold them together in harmonious cooperation, with nothingbut narrow, selfish, and conflicting nationalist traditions, races and peoplesare bound to drift towards conflict and destruction. This truth, which wasapparent to that great philosopher Kant a century or more ago—it is the gist ofhis tract upon universal peace—is now plain to the man in the street. Ourinternal policies and our economic and social ideas are profoundly vitiated atpresent by wrong and fantastic ideas of the origin and historical relationshipof social classes. A sense of history as the common adventure of all mankind isas necessary for peace within as it is for peace between the nations.The writer will offer no apology for making this experiment. Hisdisqualifications are manifest. But such work needs to be done by as many peopleas possible, he was free to make his contribution, and he was greatly attractedby the task. He has read sedulously and made the utmost use of all the help hecould obtain. There is not a chapter that has not been examined by some morecompetent person than himself and very carefully revised.

The problem ofillustrations was a very difficult one for him, for he had had no previousexperience in the production of an illustrated book. In Mr. J. F. Horrabin hehas had the good fortune to find not only an illustrator but a collaborator. Mr.Horrabin has spared no pains to make this work informative and exact. His mapsand drawings are a part of the text, the most vital and decorative part. Some ofthem represent the reading and inquiry of many laborious days.The index to this edition is the work of Mr. Strickland Gibson of Oxford.Several correspondents have asked for a pronouncing index and accordingly thishas been provided.The writer owes a word of thanks to that living index of printed books, Mr. J. FCox of the London Library. He would also like to acknowledge here the help hehas received from Mrs. Wells. Without her labour in typing and re-typing thedrafts of the various chapters as they have been revised and amended, inchecking references, finding suitable quotations, hunting up illustrations, andkeeping in order the whole mass of material for this history, and without herconstant help and watchful criticism, its completion would have been impossible.H.

VAST THOUGH IT seems to us, itis a mere speck of matter in the greater vastness of space.Space is, for the most part, emptiness. At great intervals there are in thisemptiness flaring centres of heat and light, the “fixed stars.” They are allmoving about in space, notwithstanding that they are called fixed stars, but fora long time men did not realize their motion. They are so vast and at suchtremendous distances that their motion is not perceived. Only in the course ofmany thousands of years is it appreciable. These fixed stars are so far offthat, for all their immensity, they seem to be, even when we look at themthrough the most powerful telescopes, mere points of light, brighter or lessbright. A few, however, when we turn a telescope upon them, are seen to bewhirls and clouds of shining vapour which we call nebulæ. They are so far offthat a movement of millions of miles would be imperceptible.One star, however, is so near to us that it is like a great ball of flame. Thisone is the sun. The sun is itself in its nature like a fixed star, but itdiffers from the other fixed stars in appearance because it is beyond comparisonnearer than they are; and because it is nearer men have been able to learnsomething of its nature. Its mean distance from the earth is ninety-threemillion miles. It is a mass of flaming matter, having a diameter of 866,000miles. Its bulk is a million and a quarter times the bulk of our earth.These are difficult figures for the imagination. If a bullet fired from a Maximgun at the sun kept its muzzle velocity unimpaired, it would take seven years toreach the sun. And yet we say the sun is near, measured by the scale of thestars. If the earth were a small ball, one inch in diameter, the sun would be aglobe of nine feet diameter; it would fill a small bedroom. It is spinning roundon its axis, but since it is an incandescent fluid, its polar regions do nottravel with the same velocity as its equator, the surface of which rotates inabout twenty-five days. The surface visible to us consists of clouds ofincandescent metallic vapour. At what lies below we can only guess. So hot isthe sun’s atmosphere that iron, nickel, copper, and tin are present in it in agaseous state. About it at great distances circle not only our earth, butcertain kindred bodies called the planets. These shine in the sky because theyreflect the light of the sun; they are near enough for us to note theirmovements quite easily. Night by night their positions change with regard to thefixed stars.It is well to understand how empty is space. If, as we have said, the sun were aball nine feet across, our earth would, in proportion, be the size of a one-inchball, and at a distance of 323 yards from the sun. The moon would be a speck thesize of a small pea, thirty inches from the earth. Nearer to the sun than theearth would be two other very similar specks, the planets Mercury and Venus, ata distance of 125 and 250 yards respectively. Beyond the earth would come theplanets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, at distances of 500, 1,680,3,000, 6,000, and 9,500 yards respectively. There would also be a certain numberof very much smaller specks, flying about amongst these planets, moreparticularly a number called the asteroids circling between Mars and Jupiter,and occasionally a little puff of more or less luminous vapour and dust woulddrift into the system from the almost limitless emptiness beyond. Such a puff iswhat we call a comet. All the rest of the space about us and around us and forunfathomable distances beyond is cold, lifeless, and void. The nearest fixedstar to us, on this minute scale, be it remembered—the earth as a one-inch ball,and the moon a little pea—would be over 40,000 miles away. Most of the fixedstars we see would still be scores and hundreds of millions of miles away.The science that tells of these things and how men have come to know about themis Astronomy, and to books of astronomy the reader must go to learn more aboutthe sun and stars. The science and description of the world on which we live arecalled respectively Geology and Geography.The diameter of our world is a little under 8,000 miles. Its surface is rough,the more projecting parts of the roughness are mountains, and in the hollows ofits surface there is a film of water, the oceans and seas. This film of water isabout five miles thick at its deepest part—that is to say, the deepest oceanshave a depth of five miles. This is very little in comparison with the bulk ofthe world.About this sphere is a thin covering of air, the atmosphere. As we ascend in aballoon or go up a mountain from the level of the seashore the air iscontinually less dense, until at last it becomes so thin that it cannot supportlife. At a height of twenty miles there is scarcely any air at all—not onehundredth part of the density of air at the surface of the sea. The highestpoint to which a bird can fly is about four miles up—the condor, it is said, canstruggle up to that; but most small birds and insects which are carried up byaeroplanes or balloons drop off insensible at a much lower level, and thegreatest height to which any mountaineer has ever climbed is under five miles.Men have flown in aeroplanes to a height of over four miles, and balloons withmen in them have reached very nearly seven miles, but at the cost ofconsiderable physical suffering. Small experimental balloons, containing notmen, but recording instruments, have gone as high as twenty-two miles.It is in the upper few hundred feet of the crust of the earth, in the sea, andin the lower levels of the air below four miles that life is found. We do notknow of any life at all except in these films of air and water upon our planet.So far as we know, all the rest of space is as yet without life. Scientific menhave discussed the possibility of life, or of some process of a similar kind,occurring upon such kindred bodies as the planets Venus and Mars. But they pointmerely to questionable possibilities.Astronomers and geologists and those who study physics have been able to tell ussomething of the origin and history of the earth. They consider that, vast agesago, the sun was a spinning, flaring mass of matter, not yet concentrated into acompast centre of heat and light, considerably larger than it is now, andspinning very much faster, and that as it whirled, a series of fragmentsdetached themselves from it, which became the planets. Our earth is one of theseplanets. The flaring mass that was the material of the earth broke into twomasses as it spun; a larger, the earth itself, and a smaller, which is now thedead, still moon. Astronomers give us convincing reasons for supposing that sunand earth and moon and all that system were then whirling about at a speed muchgreater than the speed at which they are moving today, and that at first ourearth was a flaming thing upon which no life could live. The way in which theyhave reached these conclusions is by a very beautiful and interesting series ofobservations and reasoning, too long and elaborate for us to deal with here. Butthey oblige us to believe that the sun, incandescent though it is, is now muchcooler than it was, and that it spins more slowly now than it did, and that itcontinues to cool and slow down. And they also show that the rate at which theearth spins is diminishing and continues to diminish—that is to say, that ourday is growing longer and longer, and that the heat at the centre of the earthwastes slowly. There was a time when the day was not a half and not a third ofwhat it is today; when a blazing hot sun, much greater than it is now, must havemoved visibly—had there been an eye to mark it—from its rise to its settingacross the skies. There will be a time when the day will be as long as a year isnow, and the cooling sun, shorn of its beams, will hang motionless in theheavens.It must have been in days of a much hotter sun, a far swifter day and night,high tides, great heat, tremendous storms and earthquakes, that life, of whichwe are a part, began upon the world. The moon also was nearer and brighter inthose days and had a changing face."},{"pageContent":"005 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_005_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWO 006[bano_9781411428843_oeb_006_r1.gif]THE RECORD OF THE ROCKS§ 1. THE FIRST LIVING THINGS. § 2. HOW OLD IS THE WORLD?§ 1WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LIFE BEGAN UPON THE EARTH.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en1]Biologists, that is to say, students of life, have made guesses about thesebeginnings, but we will not discuss them here. Let us only note that they allagree that life began where the tides of those swift days spread and recededover the steaming beaches of mud and sand.The atmosphere was much denser then, usually great cloud masses obscured thesun, frequent storms darkened the heavens. The land of those days, upheaved byviolent volcanic forces, was a barren land, without vegetation, without soil.The almost incessant rain-storms swept down upon it, and rivers and torrentscarried great loads of sediment out to sea, to become muds that hardened laterinto slates and shales, and sands that became sandstones. The geologists havestudied the whole accumulation of these sediments as it remains today, fromthose of the earliest ages to the most recent. Of course the oldest deposits arethe most distorted and changed and worn, and in them there is now no certaintrace to be found of life at all. Probably the earliest forms of life were smalland soft, leaving no evidence of their existence behind them. It was only whensome of these living things developed skeletons and shells of lime and such-likehard material that they left fossil vestiges after they died, and so putthemselves on record for examination.The literature of geology is very largely an account of the fossils that arefound in the rocks, and of the order in which layers after layers of rocks lieone on another. The very oldest rocks must have been formed before there was anysea at all, when the earth was too hot for a sea to exist, and when the waterthat is now sea was an atmosphere of steam mixed with the air. Its higher levelswere dense with clouds, from which a hot rain fell towards the rocks below, tobe converted again into steam long before it reached their incandescence. Belowthis steam atmosphere the molten world-stuff solidified as the first rocks.These first rocks must have solidified as a cake over glowing liquid materialbeneath, much as cooling lava does. They must have appeared first as crusts andclinkers. They must have been constantly remelted and recrystallized before anythickness of them became permanently solid. The name of Fundamental Gneiss isgiven to a great underlying system of crystalline rocks which probably formedage by age as this hot youth of the world drew to its close. The scenery of theworld in the days when the Fundamental Gneiss was formed must have been morelike the interior of a furnace than anything else to be found upon earth at thepresent time.After long ages the steam in the atmosphere began also to condense and fallright down to earth, pouring at last over these warm primordial rocks inrivulets of hot water and gathering in depressions as pools and lakes and thefirst seas. Into those seas the streams that poured over the rocks brought withthem dust and particles to form a sediment, and this sediment accumulated inlayers, or as geologists call them, strata, and formed the first SedimentaryRocks. Those earliest sedimentary rocks sank into depressions and were coveredby others; they were bent, tilted up, and torn by great volcanic disturbancesand by tidal strains that swept through the rocky crust of the earth. We findthese first sedimentary rocks still coming to the surface of the land here andthere, either not covered by later strata or exposed after vast ages ofconcealment by the wearing off of the rock that covered them later—there aregreat surfaces of them in Canada especially; they are cleft and bent, partiallyremelted, recrystallized, hardened and compressed, but recognizable for whatthey are. And they contain no single certain trace of life at all. They arefrequently called Azoic (lifeless) Rocks. But since in some of these earliestsedimentary rocks a substance called graphite (black lead) occurs, and also redand black oxide of iron, and since it is asserted that these substances need theactivity of living things for their production, which may or may not be thecase, some geologists prefer to call these earliest sedimentary rocks Archæozoic(primordial life). They suppose that the first life was soft living matter thathad no shells or skeletons or any such structure that could remain as arecognizable fossil after its death, and that its chemical influence caused thedeposition of graphite and iron oxide. This is pure guessing, of course, andthere is at least an equal probability that in the time of formation of theAzoic Rocks, life had not yet begun. Note its general ressemblance, exceptfor size, to the. microscopic ditchwaterlife of today007 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_007_r1.gif]Overlying or overlapping these Azoic or Archæozoic rocks come others, manifestlyalso very ancient and worn, which do contain traces of life. These first remainsare of the simplest description; they are the vestiges of simple plants calledalgæ, or marks like the tracks made by worms in the sea mud. There are also theskeletons of the microscopic creatures called Radiolaria. This second series ofrocks is called the Proterozoic (beginning of life) series, and marks a long agein the world’s history. Lying over and above the Proterozoic rocks is a thirdseries, which is found to contain a considerable number and variety of traces ofliving things. First comes the evidence of a diversity of shellfish, crabs, andsuch-like crawling things, worms, seaweeds, and the like; then of a multitude offishes and of the beginnings of land plants and land creatures. These rocks arecalled the Palæozoic (ancient life) rocks. They mark a vast era, during whichlife was slowly spreading, increasing, and developing in the seas of our world.Through long ages, through the earliest Palæozoic time, it was no more than aproliferation of such swimming and creeping things in the water. There werecreatures called trilobites; they were crawling things like big sea woodlicethat were probably related to the American king-crab of today. There were alsosea scorpions, the prefects of that early world. The individuals of certainspecies of these were nine feet long. These were the very highest sorts of life.There were abundant different sorts of an order of shellfish called brachiopods.There were plant animals, rooted and joined together like plants, and looseweeds that waved in the waters.It was not a display of life to excite our imaginations. There was nothing thatran or flew or even swam swiftly or skilfully. Except for the size of some ofthe creatures, it was not very different from, and rather less various than, thekind of life a student would gather from any summertime ditch nowadays formicroscopic examination. Such was the life of the shallow seas through a hundredmillion years or more in the early Palæozoic period. The land during that timewas apparently absolutely barren. We find no trace nor hint of land life.Everything that lived in those days lived under water for most or all of itslife. Time Chart from Earliest Life to Present Age008 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_008_r1.gif]Between the formation of these Lower Palæozoic rocks in which the sea scorpionand trilobite ruled, and our own time, there have intervened almost immeasurableages, represented by layers and masses of sedimentary rocks. There are first theUpper Palæozoic rocks, and above these the geologists distinguish two greatdivisions. Next above the Palæozoic come the Mesozoic (middle life) rocks, asecond vast system of fossil-bearing rocks, representing perhaps a hundredmillions of swift years, and containing a wonderful array of fossil remains,bones of giant reptiles and the like, which we will presently describe; andabove these again are the Cainozoic (recent life) rocks, a third great volume inthe history of life, an unfinished volume of which the sand and mud that wascarried out to sea yesterday by the rivers of the world, to bury the bones andscales and bodies and tracks that will become at last fossils of the things oftoday, constitute the last written leaf.These markings and fossils in the rocks and the rocks themselves are our firsthistorical documents. The history of life that men have puzzled out and arestill puzzling out from them is called the Record of the Rocks. By studying thisrecord men are slowly piecing together a story of life’s beginnings, and of thebeginnings of our kind, of which our ancestors a century or so ago had nosuspicion. But when we call these rocks and the fossils a record and a history,it must not be supposed that there is any sign of an orderly keeping of arecord. It is merely that whatever happens leaves some trace, if only we areintelligent enough to detect the meaning of that trace. Nor are the rocks of theworld in orderly layers one above the other, convenient for men to read. Theyare not like the books and pages of a library. They are torn, disrupted,interrupted, flung about, defaced, like a carelessly arranged office after ithas experienced in succession a bombardment, a hostile military occupation,looting, an earthquake, riots, and a fire. And so it is that for countlessgenerations this Record of the Rocks lay unsuspected beneath the feet of men.Fossils were known to the Ionian Greeks in the sixth century BC, they werediscussed at Alexandria by Eratosthenes and others in the third century BC, adiscussion which is summarised in Strabo’s Geography (?20-10 BC). They wereknown to the Latin poet Ovid, but he did not understand their nature. He thoughtthey were the first rude efforts of creative power. They were noted by Arabicwriters in the tenth century. Leonardo da Vinci, who lived so recently as theopening of the sixteenth century (1452-1519), was one of the first Europeans tograsp the real significance of fossils, and it has been only within the lastcentury and a half that man has begun the serious and sustained deciphering ofthese long-neglected early pages of his world’s history.§ 2Speculations about geological time vary enormously. Estimates of the age of theoldest rocks by geologists and astronomers starting from different standpointshave varied between 1,600,000,000, and 25,000,000. That the period of time hasbeen vast, that it is to be counted by scores and possibly by hundreds ofmillions of years, is the utmost that can be said with certainty in the matter.It is quite open to the reader to divide every number in the appended timediagram by ten or multiply it by two; no one can gainsay him. Of the relativeamount of time as between one age and another we have, however, strongerevidence; if the reader cuts down the eight hundred million we have given hereto four hundred million, then he must reduce the forty million of the Cainozoicto twenty million. And be it noted that whatever the total sum may be, mostgeologists are in agreement that half or more than half of the whole ofgeological time had passed before life had developed to the Later Palæozoiclevel. The reader reading quickly through these opening chapters may be apt tothink of them as a mere swift prelude of preparation to the apparently muchlonger history that follows, but in reality that subsequent history is longeronly because it is more detailed and more interesting to us. It looms larger inperspective. For ages that stagger the imagination this earth spun hot andlifeless, and again for ages of equal vastness it held no life above the levelof the animalculæ in a drop of ditch-water.Not only is Space from the point of view of life and humanity empty, but Time isempty also. Life is like a little glow, scarcely kindled yet, in these voidimmensities."},{"pageContent":"009 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_009_r1.gif]CHAPTER THREE 010[bano_9781411428843_oeb_010_r1.gif]NATURAL SELECTION AND THE CHANGES OF SPECIESNOW HERE IT WILL BE WELL TO PUT PLAINLY CERTAIN GENERAL FACTS about this newthing, life, that was creeping in the shallow waters and intertidal muds of theearly Palæozoic period, and which is perhaps confined to our planet alone in allthe immensity of space.Life differs from all things whatever that are without life in certain generalaspects. There are the most wonderful differences among living things today, butall living things past and present agree in possessing a certain power ofgrowth, all living things take nourishment, all living things move about as theyfeed and grow, though the movement be no more than the spread of roots throughthe soil, or of branches in the air. Moreover, living things reproduce; theygive rise to other living things, either by growing and then dividing or bymeans of seeds or spores or eggs or other ways of producing young. Reproductionis a characteristic of life.No living thing goes on living forever. There seems to be a limit of growth forevery kind of living thing. Among very small and simple living things, such asthat microscopic blob of living matter the Amœba, an individual may grow andthen divide completely into two new individuals, which again may divide in theirturn. Many other microscopic creatures live actively for a time, grow, and thenbecome quiet and inactive, enclose themselves in an outer covering and break upwholly into a number of still smaller things, spores, which are released andscattered and again grow into the likeness of their parent. Among more complexcreatures the reproduction is not usually such simple division, though divisiondoes occur even in the case of many creatures big enough to be visible to theunassisted eye. But the rule with almost all larger beings is that theindividual grows up to a certain limit of size. Then, before it becomesunwieldy, its growth declines and stops. As it reaches its full size it matures,it begins to produce young, which are either born alive or hatched from eggs.But all of its body does not produce young. Only a special part does that. Afterthe individual has lived and produced offspring for sometime, it ages and dies.It does so by a sort of necessity. There is a practical limit to its life aswell as to its growth. These things are as true of plants as they are ofanimals. And they are not true of things that do not live. Nonliving things,such as crystals, grow, but they have no set limits of growth or size, they donot move of their own accord and there is no stir within them. Crystals onceformed may last unchanged for millions of years. There is no reproduction forany nonliving thing.This growth and dying and reproduction of living things leads to some verywonderful consequences. The young which a living thing produces are eitherdirectly, or after some intermediate stages and changes (such as the changes ofa caterpillar and butterfly), like the parent living thing. But they are neverexactly like it or like each other. There is always a slight difference, whichwe speak of as individuality. A thousand butterflies this year may produce twoor three thousand next year; these latter will look to us almost exactly liketheir predecessors, but each one will have just that slight difference. It ishard for us to see individuality in butterflies because we do not observe themvery closely, but it is easy for us to see it in men. All the men and women inthe world now are descended from the men and women of AD 1800, but not one of usnow is exactly the same as one of that vanished generation. And what is true ofmen and butterflies is true of every sort of living thing, of plants as ofanimals. Every species changes all its individualities in each generation. Thatis true of all the minute creatures that swarmed and reproduced and died in theArchæozoic and Proterozoic seas, as it is of men today.Every species of living things is continually dying and being born again, as amultitude of fresh individuals.Consider, then, what must happen to a newborn generation of living things of anyspecies. Some of the individuals will be stronger or sturdier or better suitedto succeed in life in some way than the rest, many individuals will be weaker orless suited. In particular single cases any sort of luck or accident may occur,but on the whole the better equipped individuals will live and grow up andreproduce themselves and the weaker will as a rule go under. The latter will beless able to get food, to fight their enemies and pull through. So that in eachgeneration there is as it were a picking over of a species, a picking out ofmost of the weak or unsuitable and a preference for the strong and suitable.This process is called Natural Selection or the Survival of the Fittest.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en2]It follows, therefore, from the fact that living things grow and breed and die,that every species, so long as the conditions under which it lives remain thesame, becomes more and more perfectly fitted to those conditions in everygeneration.But now suppose those conditions change, then the sort of individual that usedto succeed may now fail to succeed and a sort of individual that could not geton at all under the old conditions may now find its opportunity. These specieswill change, therefore, generation by generation; the old sort of individualthat used to prosper and dominate will fail and die out and the new sort ofindividual will become the rule—until the general character of the specieschanges.Suppose, for example, there is some little furry whitey-brown animal living in abitterly cold land which is usually under snow. Such individuals as have thethickest, whitest fur will be least hurt by the cold, less seen by theirenemies, and less conspicuous as they seek their prey. The fur of this specieswill thicken and its whiteness increase with every generation, until there is noadvantage in carrying anymore fur.Imagine now a change of climate that brings warmth into the land, sweeps awaythe snows, makes white creatures glaringly visible during the greater part ofthe year and thick fur an encumbrance. Then every individual with a touch ofbrown in its colouring and a thinner fur will find itself at an advantage, andevery white and heavy fur will be a handicap. There will be a weeding out of thewhite in favour of the brown in each generation. If this change of climate comeabout too quickly, it may of course exterminate the species altogether; but ifit come about gradually, the species, although it may have a hard time, may yetbe able to change itself and adapt itself generation by generation. This changeand adaptation is called the Modification of Species.Perhaps this change of climate does not occur all over the lands inhabited bythe species; maybe it occurs only on one side of some great arm of the sea orsome great mountain range or such-like divide, and not on the other. A warmocean current like the Gulf Stream may be deflected, and flow so as to warm oneside of the barrier, leaving the other still cold. Then on the cold side thisspecies will still be going on to its utmost possible furriness and whitenessand on the other side it will be modifying towards brownness and a thinner coat.At the same time there will probably be other changes going on; a difference inthe paws perhaps, because one And it should be clear to the reader that giventhese elemental facts of life, given growth and death and reproduction withindividual variation in a world that changes, life must change in this way,modification, and differentiation must occur, old species must disappear, andnew ones appear. We have chosen for our instance here a familiar sort of animal,but what is true of furry beasts in snow and ice is true of all life, andequally true of the soft jellies and simple beginnings that flowed and crawledfor hundreds of millions of years between the tidal levels and in the shallow,warm waters of the Proterozoic seas. DIAGRAM OD LIFE IN TE LATE PALEZOIC AGE Life is creeping out of the water. Aninsect like a dragon fly is shown. there were amphibia like gigantic newts andsalamanders, and even primitive reptiles in these swamps.011 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_011_r1.gif]The early life of the early world, when the blazing sun rose and set in only aquarter of the time it now takes, when the warm seas poured in great tides overthe sandy and muddy shores of the rocky lands and the air was full of clouds andsteam, must have been modified and varied and species must have developed at agreat pace. Life was probably as swift and short as the days and years; thegenerations, which natural selection picked over, followed one another in rapidsuccession.Natural selection is a slower process with man than with any other creature. Ittakes twenty years or more before an ordinary human being in western Europegrows up and reproduces. In the case of most animals the new generation is ontrial in a year or less. With such simple and lowly beings, however, as firstappeared in the primordial seas, growth and reproduction was probably a matterof a few brief hours or even of a few brief minutes. Modification anddifferentiation of species must accordingly have been extremely rapid, and lifehad already developed a great variety of widely contrasted forms before it beganto leave traces in the rocks. The Record of the Rocks does not begin, therefore,with any group of closely related forms from which all subsequent and existingcreatures are descended. It begins in the midst of the game, with nearly everymain division of the animal kingdom already represented. Plants are alreadyplants, and animals animals. The curtain rises on a drama in the sea that hasalready begun, and has been going on for sometime. The brachiopods arediscovered already in their shells, accepting and consuming much the same sortof food that oysters and mussels do now; the great water scorpions crawl amongthe seaweeds, the trilobites roll up into balls and unroll and scuttle away. Inthat ancient mud and among those early weeds there was probably as rich andabundant and active a life of infusoria and the like as one finds in a drop ofditch-water today. In the ocean waters, too, down to the utmost downward limitto which light could filter, then as now, there was an abundance of minute andtranslucent, and in many cases phosphorescent, beings.But though the ocean and intertidal waters already swarmed with life, the landabove the high-tide line was still, so far as we can guess, a stony wildernesswithout a trace of life."},{"pageContent":"012 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_012_r1.gif]CHAPTER FOUR 013[bano_9781411428843_oeb_013_r1.gif]THE INVASION OF THE DRY LAND BY LIFE§ 1. LIFE AND WATER. § 2. THE EARLIEST ANIMALS.§ 1WHEREVER THE SHORE LINE RAN THERE WAS LIFE, AND THAT LIFE WENT on in and by andwith water as its home, its medium, and its fundamental necessity.The first jellylike beginnings of life must have perished whenever they got outof the water, as jellyfish dry up and perish on our beaches today. Drying up wasthe fatal thing for life in those days, against which at first it had noprotection. But in a world of rain-pools and shallow seas and tides, anyvariation that enabled a living thing to hold out and keep its moisture duringhours of low tide or drought met with every encouragement in the circumstancesof the time. There must have been a constant risk of stranding. And, on theother hand, life had to keep rather near the shore and beaches in the shallowsbecause it had need of air (dissolved of course in the water) and light.No creature can breathe, no creature can digest its food, without water. We talkof breathing air, but what all living things really do is to breathe oxygendissolved in water. The air we ourselves breathe must first be dissolved in themoisture in our lungs; and all our food must be liquefied before it can beassimilated. Water-living creatures which are always under water, wave thefreely exposed gills by which they breathe in that water, and extract the airdissolved in it. But a creature that is to be exposed for anytime out of thewater must have its body and its breathing apparatus protected from drying up.Before the seaweeds could creep up out of the Early Palæozoic seas into theintertidal line of the beach, they had to develop a tougher outer skin to holdtheir moisture. Before the ancestor of the sea scorpion could survive being leftby the tide it had to develop its casing and armour. The trilobites probablydeveloped their tough covering and rolled up into balls, far less as aprotection against each other and any other enemies they may have possessed,than as a precaution against drying. And when presently, as we ascend thePalæozoic rocks, the fish appear, first of all the backboned or vertebratedanimals, it is evident that a number of them are already adapted by theprotection of their gills with gill covers and by a sort of primitive lungswimming-bladder, to face the same risk of temporary stranding.Now the weeds and plants that were adapting themselves to intertidal conditionswere also bringing themselves into a region of brighter light, and light is verynecessary and precious to all plants. Any development of structure that wouldstiffen them and hold them up to the light, so that instead of crumping andflopping when the waters receded, they would stand up outspread, was a greatadvantage. And so we find them developing fibre and support, and the beginningof woody fibre in them. The early plants reproduced by soft spores, orhalf-animal “gametes,” that were released in water, were distributed by waterand could only germinate under water. The early plants were tied, and most lowlyplants today are tied, by the conditions of their life cycle, to water. But hereagain there was a great advantage to be got by the development of someprotection of the spores from drought that would enable reproduction to occurwithout submergence. So soon as a species could do that, it could live andreproduce and spread above the high-water mark, bathed in light and out of reachof the beating and distress of the waves. The main classificatory divisions ofthe larger plants mark stages in the release of plant life from the necessity ofsubmergence by the development of woody support and of a method of reproductionthat is more and more defiant of drying up. The lower plants are still theprisoner attendants of water. The lower mosses must live in damp, and even thedevelopment of the spore of the ferns demands at certain stages extreme wetness.The highest, plants have carried freedom from water so far that they can liveand reproduce if only there is some moisture in the soil below them. They havesolved their problem of living out of water altogether.The essentials of that problem were worked out through the vast æons of theProterozoic Age and the early Palæozoic Age by nature’s method of experiment andtrial. Then slowly, but in great abundance, a variety of new plants began toswarm away from the sea and over the lower lands, still keeping to swamp andlagoon and water-course as they spread.§ 2And after the plants came the animal lifeThere is no sort of land animal in the world, as there is no sort of land plant,whose structure is not primarily that of a water-inhabiting being which has beenadapted through the modification and differentiation of species to life out ofthe water. This adaptation is attained in various ways. In the case of the landscorpion the gill-plates of the primitive sea scorpion are sunken into the bodyso as to make the lung-books secure from rapid evaporation. The gills ofcrustaceans, such as the crabs which run about in the air, are protected by thegill-cover extensions of the back shell or carapace. The ancestors of theinsects developed a system of air pouches and air tubes, the tracheal tubes,which carry the air all over the body before it is dissolved. In the case of thevertebrated land animals, the gills of the ancestral fish were firstsupplemented and then replaced by a bag-like growth from the throat, theprimitive lung swimming-bladder. To this day there survive certain mudfish whichenable us to understand very clearly the method by which the vertebrated landanimals worked their way out of the water. These creatures (e.g., the Africanlung fish) are found in tropical regions in which there is a rainy full seasonand a dry season, during which the rivers become mere ditches of baked mud.During the rainy season these fish swim about and breathe by gills like anyother fish. As the waters of the river evaporate, these fish bury themselves inthe mud, their gills go out of action, and the creature keeps itself alive untilthe waters return by swallowing air, which passes into its swimming-bladder. TheAustralian lung fish, when it is caught by the drying up of the river instagnant pools, and the water has become deaerated and foul, rises to thesurface and gulps air. A newt in a pond does exactly the same thing. Thesecreatures still remain at the transition stage, the stage at which the ancestorsof the higher vertebrated animals were released from their restriction to anunderwater life.014 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_014_r1.gif]The amphibia. (frogs, newts, tritons, etc.) still show in their life history allthe stages in the process of this liberation. They are still dependent on waterfor their reproduction; their eggs must be laid in sunlit water, and there theymust develop. The young tadpole has branching external gills that wave in thewater; then a gill cover grows back over them and forms a gill chamber. Then asthe creature’s legs appear and its tail is absorbed, it begins to use its lungs,and its gills dwindle and vanish. The adult frog can live all the rest of itsdays in the air, but it can be drowned if it is kept steadfastly below water.When we come to the reptile, however, we find an egg which is protected fromevaporation by a tough egg case, and this egg produces young which breathe bylungs from the very moment of hatching. The reptile is on all fours with theseeding plant in its freedom from the necessity to pass any stage of its lifecycle in water.The later Palæozoic Rocks of the northern hemisphere give us the materials for aseries of pictures of this slow spreading of life over the land. Geographically,all round the northern half of the world it was an age of lagoons and shallowseas very favourable to this invasion. The new plants, now that they hadacquired the power to live this new aerial life, developed with an extraordinaryrichness and variety.There were as yet no true flowering plants,1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en3] no grasses nor trees that shed theirleaves in winter;2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en4] the first “flora”consisted of great tree ferns, gigantic equisetums, cycad ferns, and kindredvegetation. Many of these plants took the form of huge-stemmed trees, of whichgreat multitudes of trunks survive fossilized to this day. Some of these treeswere over a hundred feet high, of orders and classes now vanished from theworld. They stood with their stems in the water, in which no doubt there was athick tangle of soft mosses and green slime and fungoid growths that left fewplain vestiges behind them. The abundant remains of these first swamp forestsconstitute the main coal measures of the world today.Amidst this luxuriant primitive vegetation crawled and glided and flew the firstinsects. They were rigid-winged, four-winged creatures, often very big, some ofthem having wings measuring a foot in length. There were numerous dragonflies—one found in the Belgian coal-measures had a wing span of twenty-nineinches! There were also a great variety of flying cockroaches. Scorpionsabounded, and a number of early spiders, which, however, had no spinnerets forweb making. Land snails appeared. So, too, did the first-known step of our ownancestry upon land, the amphibia. As we ascend the higher levels of the LaterPalæozoic record, we find the015 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_015_r1.gif]process of air adaptation has gone as far as the appearance of true reptilesamidst the abundant and various amphibia.The land life of the Upper Palæozoic Age was the life of a green swamp forestwithout flowers or birds or the noises of modern insects. There were no big landbeasts at all; wallowing amphibia and primitive reptiles were the very highestcreatures that life had so far produced. Whatever land lay away from the wateror high above the water was still altogether barren and lifeless. Butsteadfastly, generation by generation, life was creeping away from the shallowseawater of its beginning."},{"pageContent":"016 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_016_r1.gif]CHAPTER FIVE 017[bano_9781411428843_oeb_017_r1.gif]THE AGE OF REPTILES§ 1. THE AGE OF LOWLAND LIFE. § 2. FLYING DRAGONS. § 3. THE FIRST BIRDS. § 4. ANAGE OF HARDSHIP AND DEATH. § 5. THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF FUR AND FEATHERS.§ 1WE KNOW THAT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE WETNESS and warmth, theshallow lagoon conditions that made possible the vast accumulations of vegetablematter which, compressed and mummified,1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en5] are now coal, prevailed over most ofthe world. There were some cold intervals, it is true; but they did not lastlong enough to destroy the growths. Then that long age of luxuriant low-gradevegetation drew to its end, and for a time life on the earth seems to haveundergone a period of worldwide bleakness.We cannot discuss fully here the changes that have gone on and are going on inthe climate of the earth. A great variety of causes, astronomical movements,changes in the sun and changes upon and within the earth, combine to produce aceaseless fluctuation of the conditions under which life exists. As theseconditions change, life, too, must change or perish.When the story resumes again after this arrest at the end of the Palæozoicperiod we find life entering upon a fresh phase of richness and expansion.Vegetation has made great advances in the art of living out of water. While thePalaeozoic plants of the coal measures probably grew with swamp water flowingover their roots, the Mesozoic flora from its very outset included palm-likecycads and low-grown conifers that were distinctly land plants growing on soilabove the water level. The lower levels of the Mesozoic land were no doubtcovered by great fern brakes and shrubby bush and a kind of jungle growth oftrees. But there existed as yet no grass, no small flowering plants, no turf norgreensward. Probably the Mesozoic was not an age of very brightly colouredvegetation. It must have had a flora green in the wet season and brown andpurple in the dry. There were no gay flowers, no bright autumn tints before thefall of the leaf, because there was as yet no fall of the leaf. And beyond thelower levels the world was still barren, still unclothed, still exposed withoutany mitigation to the wear and tear of the wind and rain.When one speaks of conifers in the Mesozoic the reader must not think of thepines and firs that clothe the high mountain slopes of our time. He must thinkof low-growing evergreens. The mountains were still as bare and lifeless asever. The only colour effects among the mountains were the colour effects ofnaked rock, such colours as make the landscape of Colorado so marvellous today.Amidst this spreading vegetation of the lower plains the reptiles wereincreasing mightily in multitude and variety. They were now in many casesabsolutely land animals. There are numerous anatomical points of distinctionbetween a reptile and an amphibian; they held good between such reptiles andamphibians as prevailed in the carboniferous time of the Upper Palæozoic; butthe fundamental difference between reptiles and amphibia which matters in thishistory is that the amphibian must go back to the water to lay its eggs, andthat in the early stages of its life it must live in and under water. Thereptile, on the other hand, has cut out all the tadpole stages from its lifecycle, or, to be more exact, its tadpole stages are got through before the youngleave the egg case. The reptile has come out of the water altogether. Some hadgone back to it again, just as the hippopotamus and the otter among mammals havegone back, but that is a further extension of the story to which we cannot givemuch attention in this Outline.In the Palæozoic period, as we have said, life had not spread beyond the swampyriver valleys and the borders of sea lagoons and the like; but in the Mesozoic,life was growing ever more accustomed to the thinner medium of the air, wassweeping boldly up over the plains and towards the hillsides. It is well for thestudent of human history and the human future to note that. If a disembodiedintelligence with no knowledge of the future had come to earth and studied lifeduring the early Palæozoic age, he might very reasonably have concluded thatlife was absolutely confined to the water, and that it could never spread overthe land. It found a way. In the Later Palæozoic Period that visitant might havebeen equally sure that life could not go beyond the edge of a swamp. TheMesozoic Period would still have found him setting bounds to life far morelimited than the bounds that are set today. And so today, though we mark howlife and man are still limited to five miles of air and a depth of perhaps amile or so of sea, we must not conclude from that present limitation that life,through man, may not presently spread out and up and down to a range of livingas yet inconceivable.018 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_018_r1.gif]The earliest known reptiles were beasts with great bellies and not very powerfullegs, very like their kindred amphibia, wallowing as the crocodile wallows tothis day; but in the Mesozoic they soon began to stand up and go stoutly on allfours, and several great sections of them began to balance themselves on tailand hind-legs, rather as the kangaroos do now, in order to release the forelimbs for grasping food. The bones of one notable division of reptiles whichretained a quadrupedal habit, a division of which many remains have been foundin South African and Russian Early Mesozoic deposits, display a number ofcharacters which approach those of the mammalian skeleton, and because of thisresemblance to the mammals (beasts) this division is called the Theriomorpha(beastlike). Another division was the crocodile branch, and another developedtowards the tortoises and turtles. The Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs were twogroups which have left no living representatives; they were huge reptilesreturning to a whale-like life in the sea. Pliosaurus, one of the largestplesiosaurs, measured thirty feet from snout to tail tip—of which half was neck.The Mosasaurs were a third group of great porpoise-like marine lizards. But thelargest and most diversified group of these Mesozoic reptiles was the group wehave spoken of as kangaroo-like, the Dinosaurs, many of which attained enormousproportions. In bigness these greater Dinosaurs have never been exceeded,although the sea can still show in the whales creatures as great. Some of these,and the largest among them, were herbivorous animals; they browsed on the rushyvegetation and among the ferns and bushes, or they stood up and grasped treeswith their fore-legs while they devoured the foliage. Among the browsers, forexample, were the Diplodocus carnegii, which measured eighty-four feet inlength, and the Atlantosaurus. The Gigantosaurus, disinterred by a Germanexpedition in 1912 from rocks in East Africa, was still more colossal. Itmeasured well over a hundred feet! These greater monsters had legs, and they areusually figured as standing up on them; but it is very doubtful if they couldhave supported their weight in this way, out of water. Buoyed up by water ormud, they may have got along. Another noteworthy type we have figured is theTriceratops. There were also a number of great flesh-eaters who preyed uponthese herbivores. Of these, Tyrannosaurus seems almost the last word in“frightfulness” among living things. Some species of this genus measured fortyfeet from snout to tail. Apparently it carried this vast body kangaroo fashionon its tail and hindlegs. Probably it reared itself up. Some authorities evensuppose that it leapt through the air. If so, it possessed muscles of a quitemiraculous quality. A leaping elephant would be a far less astounding idea. Muchmore probably it waded half submerged in pursuit of the herbivorous riversaurians.§ 2One special development of the dinosaurian type of reptile was a light, hopping,climbing group of creatures which developed a bat-like web between the fifthfinger and the side of the body, which was used in gliding from tree to treeafter the fashion of the flying squirrels. These bat-lizards were thePterodactyls. They are often described as flying reptiles, and pictures aredrawn of Mesozoic scenery in which they are seen soaring and swooping about. Buttheir breastbone has no keel such as the breastbone of a bird has for theattachment of muscles strong enough for long sustained flying. They must haveflitted about like bats. They must have had a grotesque resemblance to heraldicdragons, and they played the part of bat-like birds in the Mesozoic jungles. Butbird-like though they were, they were not birds nor the ancestors of birds. Thestructure of their wings was altogether different from that of birds. Thestructure of their wings was that of a hand with one long finger and a web; thewing of a bird is like an arm with feathers projecting from its hind edge. Andthese Pterodactyls had no feathers.§ 3Far less prevalent at this time were certain other truly bird-like creatures, ofwhich the earlier sorts also hopped and clambered and the later sorts skimmedand flew. These were at first—by all the standards of classification—Reptiles.They developed into true birds as they developed wings and as their reptilianscales became long and complicated, fronds rather than scales, and so at last,by much spreading and splitting, feathers. Feathers are the distinctive coveringof birds, and they give a power of resisting heat and cold far greater than thatof any other integumentary covering except perhaps the thickest fur. At a veryearly stage this novel covering of feathers, this new heatproof contrivance thatlife had chanced upon, enabled many species of birds to invade a province forwhich the pterodactyl was ill equipped. They took to sea fishing—if indeed theydid not begin with it—and spread to the north and south polewards beyond thetemperature limits set to the true reptiles. The earliest birds seem to havebeen carnivorous divers and water birds. To this day some of the most primitivebird forms are found among the sea birds of the Arctic and Antarctic seas, andit is among these sea birds that zoologists still find lingering traces ofteeth, which have otherwise vanished completely from the beak of the bird.019 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_019_r1.gif]The earliest known bird (the Archæopteryx) had no beak; it had a row of teeth ina jaw like a reptile’s. It had three claws at the forward corner of its wing.Its tail, too, was peculiar. All modern birds have their tail feathers set in ashort compact bony rump; the Archæopteryx had a long bony tail with a row offeathers along each side.020 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_020_r1.gif]§ 4This great period of Mesozoic life, this second volume of the book of life, isindeed an amazing story of reptilian life proliferating and developing. But themost striking thing of all the story remains to be told. Right up to the latestMesozoic Rocks we find all these reptilian orders we have enumerated stillflourishing unchallenged. There is no hint of an enemy or competitor to them inthe relics we find of their world. Then the record is broken. We do not know howlong a time the break represents; many pages may be missing here, pages that mayrepresent some great cataclysmal climatic change. When next we find abundanttraces of the land plants and the land animals of the earth, this greatmultitude of reptile species had gone. For the most part they have left nodescendants. They have been “wiped out.” The pterodactyls have gone absolutely,of the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs none is alive; the mosasaurs have gone; ofthe lizards a few remain, the monitors of the Dutch East Indies are the largest;all the multitude and diversity of the dinosaurs have vanished. Only thecrocodiles and the turtles and tortoises carry on in any quantity into Cainozoictimes. The place of all these types in the picture that the Cainozoic fossilspresently unfold to us is taken by other animals not closely related to theMesozoic reptiles and certainly not descended from any of their ruling types. Anew kind of life is in possession of the world.This apparently abrupt ending up of the reptiles is, beyond all question, themost striking revolution in the whole history of the earth before the coming ofmankind. It is probably connected with the close of a vast period of equablewarm conditions and the onset of a new austerer age, in which the winters werebitterer and the summers brief but hot. The Mesozoic life, animal and vegetablealike, was adapted to warm conditions and capable of little resistance to cold.The new life, on the other hand, was before all things capable of resistinggreat changes of temperature.Whatever it was that led to the extinction of the Mesozoic reptiles, it wasprobably some very far-reaching change indeed, for the life of the seas did atthe same time undergo a similar catastrophic alteration. The crescendo andending of the Reptiles on land was paralleled by the crescendo and ending of theAmmonites, a division of creatures like squids with coiled shells which swarmedin those ancient seas. All though the rocky record of this Mesozoic period thereis a vast multitude and variety of these coiled shells; there are hundreds ofspecies, and towards the end of the Mesozoic period they increased in diversityand produced exaggerated types. When the record resumes these, too, have gone.So far as the reptiles are concerned, people may perhaps be inclined to arguethat they were exterminated because the Mammals that replaced them, competedwith them, and were more fitted to survive; but nothing of the sort can be trueof the Ammonites, because to this day their place has not been taken. Simplythey are gone. Unknown conditions made it possible for them to live in theMesozoic seas, and then some unknown change made life impossible for them. Nogenus of Ammonite survives today of all that vast variety, but there stillexists one isolated genus very closely related to the Ammonites, the PearlyNautilus. It is found, it is to be noted, in the warm waters of the Indian andPacific oceans.And as for the Mammals competing with and ousting the less fit reptiles, astruggle of which people talk at times, there is not a scrap of evidence of anysuch direct competition. To judge by the Record of the Rocks as we know ittoday, there is much more reason for believing that first the reptiles in someinexplicable way perished, and then that later on, after a very hard time forall life upon the earth, the mammals, as conditions became more genial again,developed and spread to fill the vacant world.§ 5Were there mammals in the Mesozoic period?This is a question not yet to be answered precisely. Patiently and steadily thegeologists gather fresh evidence and reason out completer conclusions. Atanytime some new deposit may reveal fossils that will illuminate this question.Certainly either mammals, or the ancestors of the mammals, must have livedthroughout the Mesozoic period. In the very opening chapter of the Mesozoicvolume of the Record there were those Theriomorphous Reptiles to which we havealready alluded, and in the later Mesozoic a number of small jawbones are found,entirely mammalian in character. But there is not a scrap, not a bone, tosuggest that there lived any Mesozoic Mammal which could look a dinosaur in theface. The Mesozoic mammals or mammal-like reptiles—for we do not know clearlywhich they were—seem to have been all obscure little beasts of the size of miceand rats, more like a downtrodden order of reptiles than a distinct class;probably they still laid eggs and were developing only slowly their distinctivecovering of hair. They lived away from big waters, and perhaps in the desolateuplands, as marmots do now; probably they lived there beyond the pursuit of thecarnivorous dinosaurs. Some perhaps went on all fours, some chiefly went ontheir hind-legs and clambered with their fore limbs. They became fossils only sooccasionally that chance has not yet revealed a single complete skeleton in thewhole vast record of the Mesozoic rocks by which to check these guesses.021 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_021_r1.gif]These little Theriomorphs, these ancestral mammals, developed hair. Hairs, likefeathers, are long and elaborately specialized scales. Hair is perhaps the clueto the salvation of the early mammals. Leading lives upon the margin ofexistence, away from the marshes and the warmth, they developed an outercovering only second in its warmth-holding (or heat-resisting) powers to thedown and feathers of the Arctic sea-birds. And so they held out through the ageof hardship between the Mesozoic and Cainozoic ages, to which most of the truereptiles succumbed.All the main characteristics of this flora and sea and land fauna that came toan end with the end of the Mesozoic age were such as were adapted to an equableclimate and to shallow and swampy regions. But in the case of their Cainozoicsuccessors, both hair and feathers gave a power of resistance to variabletemperatures such as no reptile possessed, and with it they gave a range fargreater than any animal had hitherto attained.The range of life of the Lower Palæozoic Period was confined to warm water.The range of life of the Upper Palæozoic Period was confined to warm water or towarm swamps and wet ground.The range of life of the Mesozoic Period as we know it was confined to water andfairly low-lying valley regions under equable conditions.Meanwhile in each of these periods there were types involuntarily extending therange of life beyond the limits prevailing in that period; and when ages ofextreme conditions prevailed, it was these marginal types which survived toinherit the depopulated world.That perhaps is the most general statement we can make about the story of thegeological record; it is a story of widening range. Classes, genera, and speciesof animals appear and disappear, but the range widens. It widens always. Lifehas never had so great a range as it has today. Life today, in the form of man,goes higher in the air than it has ever done before; man’s geographical range isfrom pole to pole, he goes under the water in submarines, he sounds the cold,lifeless darkness of the deepest seas, he burrows into virgin levels of therocks, and in thought and knowledge he pierces to the centre of the earth andreaches out to the uttermost star. Yet in all the relics of the Mesozoic time wefind no certain memorials of his ancestry. His ancestors, like the ancestors ofall the kindred mammals, must have been creatures so rare, so obscure, and soremote that they have left scarcely a trace amidst the abundant vestiges of themonsters that wallowed rejoicing in the steamy air and lush vegetation of theMesozoic lagoons, or crawled or hopped or fluttered over the great river plainsof that time."},{"pageContent":"022 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_022_r1.gif]CHAPTER SIX 023[bano_9781411428843_oeb_023_r1.gif]THE AGE OF MAMMALS§ 1. A NEW AGE OF LIFE. § 2. TRADITION COMES INTO THE WORLD. § 3. AN AGE OFBRAIN GROWTH. § 4. THE WORLD GROWS HARD AGAIN.§ 1THE THIRD GREAT DIVISION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD, THE CAINOZOIC, opens with aworld already physically very like the world we live in today. Probably the daywas at first still perceptibly shorter, but the scenery had become very modernin its character. Climate was, of course, undergoing, age by age, its incessantand irregular variations; lands that are temperate today have passed, since theCainozoic age began, through phases of great warmth, intense cold, and extremedryness; but the landscape, if it altered, altered to nothing that cannot stillbe paralleled today in some part of the world or other. In the place of thecycads, sequoias, and strange conifers of the Mesozoic, the plant names that nowappear in the lists of fossils include birch, beech, holly, tulip trees, ivy,sweet gum, bread-fruit trees. Flowers had developed concurrently with bees andbutterflies. Palms were now very important. Such plants had already been inevidence in the later levels of the (American Cretaceous) Mesozoic, but now theydominated the scene altogether. Grass was becoming a great fact in the world.Certain grasses, too, had appeared in the later Mesozoic, but only with theCainozoic period came grass plains and turf spreading wide over a world that wasonce barren stone.The period opened with a long phase of considerable warmth; then the worldcooled. And in the opening of this third part of the record, this Cainozoicperiod, a gigantic crumpling of the earth’s crust and an upheaval of mountainranges was in progress. The Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, are all Cainozoicmountain ranges; the background of an early Cainozoic scene to be typical shoulddisplay an active volcano or so. It must have been an age of great earthquakes.Geologists make certain main divisions of the Cainozoic period, and it will beconvenient to name them here and to indicate their climate. First comes theEocene (dawn of recent life), an age of exceptional warmth in the world’shistory, subdivided into an older and newer Eocene; then the Oligocene (butlittle of recent life), in which the climate was still equable. The Miocene(with living species still in a minority) was the great age of mountainbuilding, and the general temperature was falling. In the Pliocene (more livingthan extinct species), climate was very much as its present phase; but with thePleistocene (a great majority of living species) there set in a long period ofextreme conditions—it was the Great Ice Age. Glaciers spread from the polestowards the equator, until England to the Thames was covered in ice. Thereafterto our own time came a period of partial recovery. We may be moving now towardsa warmer phase. Half a million years hence this may be a much sunnier andpleasanter world to live in than it is today.§ 2In the forests and following the grass over the Eocene plains there appeared forthe first time a variety and abundance of mammals. Before we proceed to anydescription of these mammals, it may be well to note in general terms what amammal is.From the appearance of the vertebrated animals in the Lower Palæozoic Age, whenthe fish first swarmed out into the sea, there has been a steady progressivedevelopment of vertebrated creatures. A fish is a vertebrated animal thatbreathes by gills and can live only in water. An amphibian may be described as afish that has added to its gill-breathing the power of breathing air with itsswimming-bladder in adult life, and that has also developed limbs with five toesto them in place of the fins of a fish. A tadpole is for a time a fish, itbecomes a land creature as it develops. A reptile is a further stage in thisdetachment from water; it is an amphibian that is no longer amphibious; itpasses through its tadpole stage—its fish stage that is—in an egg. From thebeginning it must breathe in air; it can never breathe under water as a tadpolecan do. Now a modern mammal is really a sort of reptile that has developed apeculiarly effective protective covering, hair; and that also retains its eggsin the body until they hatch so that it brings forth living young (viviparous),and even after birth it cares for them and feeds them by its mammæ for a longeror shorter period. Some reptiles, some vipers for example, are viviparous, butnone stand by their young as the real mammals do. Both the birds and themammals, which escaped whatever destructive forces made an end to the Mesozoicreptiles, and which survived to dominate the Cainozoic world, have these twothings in common; first, a, far more effective protection against changes oftemperature than any other variation of the reptile type ever produced, and,secondly, a peculiar care for their eggs, the bird by incubation and the mammalby retention, and a disposition to look after the young for a certain periodafter hatching or birth. There is by comparison the greatest carelessness aboutoffspring in the reptile.024 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_024_r1.gif]Hair was evidently the earliest distinction of the mammals from the rest of thereptiles. It is doubtful if the particular Theriodont reptiles who weredeveloping hair in the early Mesozoic were viviparous. Two mammals survive tothis day which not only do not suckle their young,1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en6] but which lay eggs, the Ornithorhynchusand the Echidna, and in the Eocene there were a number of allied forms. They arethe survivors of what was probably a much larger number and variety of smallegg-laying hairy creatures, hairy reptiles, hoppers, climbers, and runners,which included the Mesozoic ancestors of all existing mammals up to andincluding man.Now we may put the essential facts about mammalian reproduction in another way.The mammal is a family animal. And the family habit involved the possibility ofa new sort of continuity of experience in the world. Compare the completelyclosed-in life of an individual lizard with the life of even a quite lowlymammal of almost any kind. The former has no mental continuity with anythingbeyond itself; it is a little self-contained globe of experience that serves itspurpose and ends; but the latter “picks up” from its mother, and “hands on” toits offspring. All the mammals, except for the two genera we have named, hadalready before the lower Eocene age arrived at this stage of pre-adultdependence and imitation. They were all more or less imitative in youth andcapable of a certain modicum of education; they all, as a part of theirdevelopment, received a certain amount of care and example and even directionfrom their mother. This is as true of the hyæna and rhinoceros as it is of thedog or man; the difference of educability is enormous, but the fact ofprotection and educability in the young stage is undeniable. So far as thevertebrated animals go, these new mammals, with their viviparous,young-protecting disposition, and these new birds, with their incubating,young-protecting disposition, introduce at the opening of the Cainozoic period afresh thing into the expanding story of life, namely, social association, theaddition to hard and inflexible instinct of tradition, and the nervousorganisation necessary to receive tradition.All the innovations that come into the history of life begin very humbly. Thesupply of blood-vessels in the swimming-bladder of the mudfish in the lowerPalæozoic torrent-river, that enabled it to pull through a season of drought,would have seemed at that time to that bodiless visitant to our planet we havealready imagined, a very unimportant side fact in that ancient world of greatsharks and plated fishes, sea scorpions, and coral reefs and seaweed; but itopened the narrow way by which the land vertebrates arose to predominance. Themudfish would have seemed then a poor refugee from the too crowded andaggressive life of the sea. But once lungs were launched into the world, everyline of descent that had lungs went on improving them. So, too, in the upperPalæozoic, the fact that some of the Amphibia were losing their “amphibiousness”by a retardation of hatching of their eggs, would have appeared a mere responseto the distressful dangers that threatened the young tadpole. Yet that preparedthe conquest of the dry land for the triumphant multitude of the Mesozoicreptiles. It opened a new direction towards a free and vigorous land-life alongwhich all the reptilian animals moved. And this viviparous, young-tendingtraining that the ancestral mammalia underwent during that age of inferiorityand hardship for them, set going in the world a new continuity of perception, ofwhich even man today only begins to appreciate the significance.025 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_025_r1.gif]§ 3A number of types of mammal already appear in the Eocene. Some aredifferentiating in one direction, and some in another, some are perfectingthemselves as herbivorous quadrupeds, some leap and climb among the trees, someturn back to the water to swim, but all types are unconsciously exploiting anddeveloping the brain which is the instrument of this new power of acquisitionand educability. In the Eocene rocks are found small early predecessors of thehorse (Eohippus), tiny camels, pigs, early tapirs, early hedgehogs, monkeys andlemurs, opossums and carnivores. Now, all these were more or less ancestral toliving forms, and all have brains relatively much smaller than their livingrepresentatives. There is, for instance, an early rhinoceros-like beast,Titanotherium, with a brain not one tenth the size of that of the existingrhinoceros. The latter is by no means a perfect type of the attentive andsubmissive student, but even so it is ten times more observant and teachablethan its predecessor. This sort of thing is true of all the orders and familiesthat survive until today. All the Cainozoic mammals were doing this one thing incommon under the urgency of a common necessity; they were all growing brain. Itwas a parallel advance. In the same order or family today, the brain is usuallyfrom six to ten times what it was in the Eocene ancestor.The Eocene period displayed a series of herbivorous brutes of which norepresentative survives today. Such were the Uintatheres and the Titanotheres.They were ousted by more specialized graminivorous forms as grass spread overthe world. In pursuit of such beasts came great swarms of primitive dogs, someas big as bears, and the first cats, one in particular (Smilodon), a smallfierce-looking creature with big knife-like canines, the first sabre-toothedtiger, which was to develop into greater things. American deposits in theMiocene display a great variety of camels, giraffe camels with long necks,gazelle camels, llamas, and true camels. North America, throughout most of theCainozoic period, appears to have been in open and easy continuation with Asia,and when at last the glaciers of the Great Ice Age, and then the Bering Strait,came to separate the two great continental regions, the last camels were left inthe old world and the llamas in the new.In the Eocene the first ancestors of the elephants appear in northern Africa assnouted creatures; the elephant’s trunk dawned on the world in the Miocene.One group of creatures is of peculiar interest in a history that is mainly to bethe story of mankind. We find fossils in the Eocene of monkeys and lemurs, butof one particular creature we have as yet not a single bone. It must have been acreature half ape, half monkey; it clambered about the trees and ran, andprobably ran well, on its hind-legs upon the ground. It was small-brained by ourpresent standards, but it had clever hands with which it handled fruits and beatnuts upon the rocks and caught up sticks and stones to smite its fellows. Spiteof the lack of material evidence, the facts of biological science almost compelus to believe that such a creature existed, the common ancestor of theanthropoid apes and the two species of men we will describe in the next chapter.§ 4Through millions of simian generations the spinning world circled about the sun;slowly its orbit, which may have been nearly circular during the equable days ofthe early Eocene, was drawn by the attraction of the circling outer planets intoa more elliptical form. Its axis of rotation, which had always heeled over tothe plane of its orbit, as the mast of a yacht under sail heels over to thelevel of the water, heeled over by imperceptible degrees a little more and alittle more. And each year its summer point shifted a little further fromperihelion round its path. These were small changes to happen to a one-inchball, circling at a distance of 330 yards from a flaming sun nine feet across,in the course of a few million years. They were changes an immortal astronomerin Neptune, watching the earth from age to age, would have found almostimperceptible. But from the point of view of the surviving mammalian life of theMiocene, they mattered profoundly. Age by age the winters grew on the wholecolder and harder and a few hours longer relatively to the summers in a thousandyears; age by age the summers grew briefer. On an average the winter snow lay alittle later in the spring in each century, and the glaciers in the northernmountains gained an inch this year, receded half an inch next, came on again afew inches. . . .The Record of the Rocks tells of the increasing chill. The Pliocene was atemperate time, and many of the warmth-loving plants and animals had gone. Then,rather less deliberately, some feet or some inches every year, the ice came on.An arctic fauna, musk ox, woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, lemming, ushers inthe Pleistocene. Over North America, and Europe and Asia alike, the iceadvanced. For thousands of years it advanced, and then for thousands of years itreceded, to advance again. Europe down to the Baltic shores, Britain down to theThames, North America down to New England, and more centrally as far south asOhio, lay for ages under the glaciers. Enormous volumes of water were withdrawnfrom the ocean and locked up in those stupendous ice caps so as to cause aworldwide change in the relative levels of land and sea. Vast areas were exposedthat are now again sea bottom.The world today is still coming slowly out of the last of four great waves ofcold. It is not growing warmer steadily. There have been fluctuations. Remainsof bog oaks, for example, which grew two or three thousand years ago, are foundin Scotland at latitudes in which not even a stunted oak will grow at thepresent time. And it is amidst this crescendo and diminuendo of frost and snowthat we first recognize forms that are like the forms of men. The Age of Mammalsculminated in ice and hardship and man."},{"pageContent":"026 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_026_r1.gif]CHAPTER SEVEN 027[bano_9781411428843_oeb_027_r1.gif]THE ANCESTRY OF MAN§ 1. MAN DESCENDED FROM A WALKING APE. § 2. FIRST TRACES OF MANLIKE CREATURES. §3. THE HEIDELBERG SUB-MAN. § 4. THE PILTDOWN SUB-MAN. § 5. THE RIDDLE OF THEPILTDOWN REMAINS.§ 1THE ORIGIN OF MAN IS STILL VERY OBSCURE. IT IS COMMONLY ASSERTED that he is“descended” from some manlike ape such as the chimpanzee, the orangutang, or thegorilla, but that of course is as reasonable as saying that I am “descended”from some Hottentot or Esquimau as young or younger than myself. Others, aliveto this objection, say that man is descended from the common ancestor of thechimpanzee, the orangutang, and the gorilla. Some “anthropologists” have evenindulged in a speculation whether mankind may not have a double or trebleorigin; the negro being descended from a gorilla-like ancestor, the Chinese froma chimpanzee-like ancestor, and so on. These are very fanciful ideas, to bementioned only to be dismissed. It was formerly assumed that the human ancestorwas “probably arboreal,” but the current idea among those who are qualified toform an opinion seems to be that he was a “ground ape,” and that the existingapes have developed in the arboreal direction.Of course if one puts the skeleton of a man and the skeleton of a gorilla sideby side, their general resemblance is so great that it is easy to jump to theconclusion that the former is derived from such a type as the latter by aprocess of brain growth and general refinement. But if one examines closely intoone or two differences, the gap widens. Particular stress has recently been laidupon the tread of the foot. Man walks on his toe and his heel; his great toe ishis chief lever in walking, as the reader may see for himself if he examines hisown footprints on the bathroom floor and notes where the pressure falls as thefootprints become fainter. His great toe is the king of his toes.028 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_028_r1.gif]Among all the apes and monkeys, the only group that have their great toesdeveloped on anything like the same fashion as man are some of the lemurs. Thebaboon walks on a flat foot and all his toes, using his middle toe as his chiefthrow-off, much as the bear does. And the three great apes all walk on the outerside of the foot in a very different manner from the walking of man. THE DIAGRAM OF THE GLACIAL AGES.The reader should compare this diagram.carefully with our first time diagram, chapter 2, § 2,p.11. That diagram, if itwrwe on the same scaleas this one, would be between 41 and 410 feet long. Theposition of the Eoanithropusis very uncertain; it may be as early as thePliocene.029 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_029_r1.gif]The great apes are forest dwellers; their walking even now is incidental; theyare at their happiest among trees. They have very distinctive methods ofclimbing; they swing by the arms much more than the monkeys do, and do not, likethe latter, take off with a spring from the feet. They have a speciallydeveloped climbing style of their own. But man walks so well and runs so swiftlyas to suggest a very long ancestry upon the ground. Also, he does not climb wellnow; he climbs with caution and hesitation. His ancestors may have been runningcreatures for long ages. Moreover, it is to be noted that h e does not swimnaturally; he has to learn to swim, and that seems to point to a longstandingseparation from rivers and lakes and the sea. Almost certainly that ancestor wasa smaller and slighter creature than its human descendants. Conceivably thehuman ancestor at the opening of the Cainozoic period was a running ape livingchiefly on the ground, hiding among rocks rather than trees. It could stillclimb trees well and hold things between its great toe and its second toe (asthe Japanese can to this day), but it was already coming down to the groundagain from a still remoter, a Mesozoic arboreal ancestry. It is quiteunderstandable that such a creature would very rarely die in water in suchcircumstances as to leave bones to become fossilized. POSSIBLE APPEARANCE OF THE SUB-MANPITHECANTHROPUS.The face, jaws, and teeth are mere guesswork (see text). The creature may havebeen much less human-looking than this.030 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_030_r1.gif]It must always be borne in mind that among its many other imperfections theGeological Record necessarily contains abundant traces only of water or marshcreatures or of creatures easily and frequently drowned. The same reasons thatmake any traces of the ancestors of the mammals rare and relatively unprocurablein the Mesozoic rocks, probably make the traces of possible human ancestors rareand relatively unprocurable in the Cainozoic rocks. Such knowledge as we have ofthe earliest men, for example, is almost entirely got from a few caves, intowhich they went and in which they left their traces. Until the hard Pleistocenetimes they lived and died in the open, and their bodies were consumed or decayedaltogether.But it is well to bear in mind also that the record of the rocks has still to bethoroughly examined. It has been studied only for a few generations, and by onlya few men in each generation. Most men have been too busy making war, makingprofits out of their neighbours, toiling at work that machinery could do forthem in a tenth of the time, or simply playing about, to give any attention tothese more interesting things. There may be, there probably are, thousands ofdeposits still untouched containing countless fragments and vestiges of man andhis progenitors. In Asia particularly, in India or the East Indies, there may behidden the most illuminating clues. What we know today of early men is themerest scrap of what will presently be known.The apes and monkeys already appear to have been differentiated at the beginningof the Cainozoic Age, and there are a number of Oligocene and Miocene apes whoserelations to one another and to the human line have still to be made out. Amongthese we may mention Dryopithecus of the Miocene Age, with a very human-lookingjaw. In the Siwalik Hills of northern India remains of some very interestingapes have been found, of which Sivapithecus and Palæopithecus were possiblyrelated closely to the human ancestor. Possibly these animals already usedimplements. Charles Darwin represents baboons as opening nuts by breaking themwith stones, using stakes to prise up rocks in the hunt for insects, andstriking blows with sticks and stones. The chimpanzee makes itself a sort oftree hut by intertwining branches. Stones apparently chipped for use have beenfound in strata of Oligocene Age at Boncelles in Belgium. Possibly theimplement-using disposition was already present in the Mesozoic ancestry fromwhich we are descended.§ 2Among the earliest evidences of some creature, either human or at least moremanlike than any living ape upon earth, are a number of flints and stones veryroughly chipped and shaped so as to be held in the hand. These were probablyused as hand-axes. These early implements (“Eoliths”) are often so crude andsimple that there was for a long time a controversy whether they were to beregarded as natural or artificial productions. The date of the earliest of themis put by geologists as Pliocene—that is to say, before the First Glacial Age.They occur also throughout the First Interglacial period. We know of no bones orother remains in Europe or America of the quasi-human beings of half a millionyears ago, who made and used these implements. They used them to hammer with,perhaps they used them to fight with, and perhaps they used bits of wood forsimilar purposes.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en7]But at Trinil, in Java, in strata which are said to correspond either to thelater Pliocene or to the American and European First Ice Age, there have beenfound some scattered bones of a creature, such as the makers of these earlyimplements may have been. The top of a skull, some teeth, and a thighbone havebeen found. The skull shows a brain-case about halfway in size between that ofthe chimpanzee and man, but the thighbone is that of a creature as well adaptedto standing and running as a man, and as free, therefore, to use its hands. Thecreature was not a man, nor was it an arboreal ape like the chimpanzee. It was awalking ape. It has been named by naturalists Pithecanthropus erectus (thewalking ape-man). We cannot say that it is a direct human ancestor, but we mayguess that the creatures who scattered these first stone tools over the worldmust have been closely similar and kindred, and that our ancestor was a beast oflike kind. This little trayful of bony fragments from Trinil is, at present,apart from stone implements, the oldest relic of early humanity, or of the closeblood relations of early humanity, that is known.While these early men or “sub-men” were running about Europe four or fivehundred thousand years ago, there were mammoths, rhinoceroses, a hugehippopotamus, a giant beaver, and a bison and wild cattle in their world. Therewere also wild horses, and the sabre-toothed tiger still abounded. There are notraces of lions or true tigers at that time in Europe, but there were bears,otters, wolves, and a wild boar. It may be that the early sub-man sometimesplayed jackal to the sabre-toothed tiger, and finished up the bodies on whichthe latter had gorged itself.§ 3After this first glimpse of something at least sub-human in the record ofgeology, there is not another fragment of human or manlike bone yet known fromthat record for an interval of hundreds of thousands of years. It is not untilwe reach deposits which are stated to be of the Second Interglacial period,200,000 years later, 200,000 or 250,000 years ago, that another little scrap ofbone comes to hand. Then we find a jawbone.This jawbone was found in a sand-pit near Heidelberg, at a depth of eighty feetfrom the surface, and it is not the jawbone of a man as we understand man, butit is manlike in every respect, except that it has absolutely no trace of achin; it is more massive than a man’s, and its narrowness behind could not, itis thought, have given the tongue sufficient play for articulate speech. It isnot an ape’s jawbone; the teeth are human. The owner of this jawbone has beenvariously named Homo Heidelbergensis and Palæoanthropus Heidelbergensis,according to the estimate formed of his humanity or sub-humanity by variousauthorities. He lived in a world not remotely unlike the world of the stillearlier sub-man of the first implements; the deposits in which it is found showthat there were elephants, horses, rhinoceroses, bison, a moose, and so forthwith it in the world, but the sabre-toothed tiger was declining and the lion wasspreading over Europe. The implements of this period (known as the Chelleanperiod) are a very considerable advance upon those of the Pliocene Age. They arewell made but very much bigger than any truly human implements. The Heidelbergman may have had a very big body and large fore limbs. He may have been awoolly, strange-looking creature.§ 4We must turn over the Record for, it may be, another 100,000 years for the nextremains of anything human or sub-human. Then in a deposit ascribed to the ThirdInterglacial period, which may have begun 100,000 years ago and lasted 50,000years, the smashed pieces of a whole skull turn up. The deposit is a gravelwhich may have been derived from the washing out of still earlier gravel strata,and this skull fragment may be in reality as old as the First Glacial Period.The bony remains discovered at Piltdown in Sussex display a creature stillascending only very gradually from the sub-human.The first scraps of this skull were found in an excavation for road gravel inSussex. Bit by bit other fragments of this skull were hunted out from the quarryheaps until most of it could be pieced together. It is a thick skull, thickerthan that of any living race of men, and it has a brain capacity intermediatebetween that of Pithecanthropus and man. This creature has been namedEoanthropus, the dawn man. In the same gravel-pits were found teeth ofrhinoceros, hippopotamus, and the leg-bone of a deer with marks upon it that maybe cuts. A curious bat-shaped instrument of elephant bone has also been found.There was moreover a jawbone among these scattered remains, which was at firstassumed naturally enough to belong to Eoanthropus, but which it was afterwardssuggested was probably that of a chimpanzee. It is extraordinarily like that ofa chimpanzee, but Dr. Keith, one of the greatest authorities in these questions,assigns it, after an exhaustive analysis in his Antiquity of Man (1915), to theskull with which it is found. It is, as a jawbone, far less human in characterthan the jaw of the much more ancient Homo Heidelbergensis, but the teeth are insome respects more like those of living men.Dr. Keith, swayed by the jawbone, does not think that Eoanthropus, in spite ofits name, is a creature in the direct ancestry of man. Much less is it anintermediate form between the Heidelberg man and the Neanderthal man we shallpresently describe. It was only related to the true ancestor of man as the orangis related to the chimpanzee. It was one of a number of sub-human running apesof more than ape-like intelligence, and if it was not on the line royal, it wasat any rate a very close collateral.After this glimpse of a skull, the Record for very many centuries gives nothingbut flint implements, which improve steadily in quality. A very characteristicform is shaped like a sole, with one flat side stricken off at one blow and theother side worked. The archæologists, as the Record continues, are presentlyable to distinguish scrapers, borers, knives, darts, throwing stones, and thelike. Progress is now more rapid; in a few centuries the shape of the hand-axeshows distinct and recognizable improvements. And then comes quite a number ofremains. The Fourth Glacial Age is rising towards its maximum. Man is taking tocaves and leaving vestiges there; at Krapina in Croatia, at Neanderthal nearDüsseldorf, at Spy, human remains have been found, skulls and bones of acreature that is certainly a man. Somewhen about 50,000 years ago, if notearlier, appeared Homo Neanderthalensis (also called Homo antiquus and Homoprimigenius), a quite passable human being. His thumb was not quite equal inflexibility and usefulness to a human thumb, he stooped forward and could nothold his head erect, as all living men do, he was chinless and perhaps incapableof speech, there were curious differences about the enamel and the roots of histeeth from those of all living men, he was very thick-set, he was, indeed, notquite of the human species; but there is no dispute about his attribution to thegenus Homo. He was certainly not descended from Eoanthropus, but his jawbone isso like the Heidelberg jawbone, as to make it possible that the clumsier andheavier Homo Heidelbergensis, a thousand centuries before him, was of his bloodand race."},{"pageContent":"031 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_031_r1.gif]CHAPTER EIGHT 032[bano_9781411428843_oeb_032_r1.gif]THE NEANDERTHAL MEN, AN EXTINCT RACE(The Early Palæolithic Age1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en8])§ 1. THE WORLD 50,000 YEARS AGO. § 2. THE DAILY LIFE OF THE FIRST MEN.§ 3. THELAST PALÆOLITHIC MEN.§ 1IN THE TIME OF THE THIRD INTERGLACIAL PERIOD THE OUTLINE OF EUROPE and WesternAsia was very different from what it is today. Vast areas to the west andnorthwest which are now under the Atlantic waters were then dry land; the IrishSea and the North Sea were river valleys. Over these northern areas there spreadand receded and spread again a great ice cap such as covers central Greenlandtoday (see map on p. 53). This vast ice cap, which covered both polar regions ofthe earth, withdrew huge masses of water from the ocean, and the sea-levelconsequently fell, exposing great areas of land that are now submerged again.The Mediterranean area was probably a great valley below the general sea-level,containing two inland seas cut off from the general ocean. The climate of thisMediterranean basin was perhaps cold temperate, and the region of the Sahara tothe south was not then a desert of baked rock and blown sand, but a well-wateredand fertile country. Between the ice sheets to the north and the Alps andMediterranean valley to the south stretched a bleak wilderness whose climatechanged from harshness to a mild kindliness and then hardened again for theFourth Glacial Age.Across this wilderness, which is now the great plain of Europe, wandered avarious fauna. At first there were hippopotami, rhinoceroses, mammoths, andelephants. The sabre-toothed tiger was diminishing towards extinction. Then, asthe air chilled, the hippopotamus, and then other warmth-loving creatures,ceased to come so far north, and the sabre-toothed tiger disappeared altogether.The woolly mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the musk ox, the bison, the aurochs,and the reindeer became prevalent, and the temperate vegetation gave place toplants of a more arctic type. The glaciers spread southward to the maximum ofthe Fourth Glacial Age (about 50,000 years ago), and then receded again. In theearlier phase, the Third Interglacial period, a certain number of small familygroups of men (Homo Neanderthalensis) and probably of sub-men (Eoanthropus)wandered over the land, leaving nothing but their flint implements to witness totheir presence. They probably used a multitude and variety of wooden implementsalso; they had probably learnt much about the shapes of objects and the use ofdifferent shapes from wood, knowledge which they afterwards applied to stone;but none of this wooden material has survived; we can only speculate about itsforms and uses. As the weather hardened to its maximum of severity, theNeanderthal men, already it would seem acquainted with the use of fire, began toseek shelter under rock ledges and in caves—and so leave remains behind them.Hitherto they had been accustomed to squat in the open about the fire, and neartheir water supply. But they were sufficiently intelligent to adapt themselvesto the new and harder conditions. (As for the sub-men, they seem to havesuccumbed to the stresses of this Fourth Glacial Age altogether. At any rate,the rudest type of Palæolithic implements presently disappears).Not merely man was taking to the caves. This period also had a cave lion, a cavebear, and a cave hyæna. These creatures had to be driven out of the caves andkept out of the caves in which these early men wanted to squat and hide; and nodoubt fire was an effective method of eviction and protection. Probably earlymen did not go deeply into the caves, because they had no means of lightingtheir recesses. They got in far enough to be out of the weather, and stored woodand food in odd corners. Perhaps they barricaded the cave mouths. Their onlyavailable light for going deeply into the caverns would be torches.What did these Neanderthal men hunt? Their only possible weapons for killingsuch giant creatures as the mammoth or the cave bear, or even the reindeer, werespears of wood, wooden clubs, and those big pieces of flint they left behindthem, the “Chellean” and “Mousterian” implements;2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en9] and probably their usual quarry wassmaller game. But they did certainly eat the flesh of the big beasts when theyhad a chance, and perhaps they followed them when sick or when wounded bycombats, or took advantage THIS MAP REPRESENTS THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE GEOGRAPHY OFEUROPE AND WESTERN ASIA AT A PERIOD WHICH WE GUESS TO BE ABOUT 50,000 YEARS AGO,THE NEANDERTHALER AGE. Much of this map is of course speculative, but its broadoutlines must be fairly like those of the world in which men first became men.033 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_033_r1.gif]of them when they were bogged or in trouble with ice or water. (The LabradorIndians still kill the caribou with spears at awkward river crossings). AtDewlish, in Dorset, an artificial trench has been found which is supposed tohave been a Palæolithic trap for elephants.3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en10] We know that the Neanderthalers partlyate their kill where it fell; but they brought back the big narrow bones to thecave to crack and eat at leisure, because few ribs and vertebræ are found in thecaves, but great quantities of cracked and split long bones. They used skins towrap about them, and the women probably dressed the skins. We know also thatthey were right-handed like modern men, because the left side of the brain(which serves the right side of the body) is bigger than the right. But whilethe back parts of the brain which deal with sight and touch and the energy ofthe body are well developed, the front parts, which are connected with thoughtand speech, are comparatively small. It was as big a brain as ours, butdifferent. This species of Homo had certainly a very different mentality fromours; its individuals were not merely simpler and lower than we are, they wereon another line. It may be they did not speak at all, or very sparingly. Theyhad nothing that we should call a language.034 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_034_r1.gif]§ 2In Worthington Smith’s Man the Primeval Savage there is a very vividly writtendescription of early Palæolithic life, from which much of the following accountis borrowed. In the original, Mr. Worthington Smith assumes a more extensivesocial life, a larger community, and a more definite division of labour amongits members than is altogether justifiable in the face of such subsequentwritings as J. J. Atkinson’s memorable essay on Primal Law.4[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en11] For the little tribe Mr. WorthingtonSmith described, there has been substituted, therefore, a family group under theleadership of one Old Man, and the suggestions of Mr. Atkinson as to thebehaviour of the Old Man have been worked into the sketch.Mr. Worthington Smith describes a squatting-place near a stream, becauseprimitive man, having no pots or other vessels, must needs have kept close to awater supply, and with some chalk cliffs adjacent from which flints could be gotto work. The air was bleak, and the fire was of great importance, because firesonce out were not easily relit in those days. When not required to blaze it wasprobably banked down with ashes. The most probable way in which fires werestarted was by hacking a bit of iron pyrites with a flint amidst dry deadleaves; concretions of iron pyrites and flints are found together in Englandwhere the gault and chalk approach each other.5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en12] The little group of people would besquatting about amidst a litter of fern, moss, and such-like dry material. Someof the women and children would need to be continually gathering fuel to keep upthe fires. It would be a tradition that had grown up. The young would imitatetheir elders in this task. Perhaps there would be rude wind shelters of boughson one side of the encampment.The Old Man, the father and master of the group, would perhaps be engaged inhammering flints beside the fire. The children would imitate him and learn touse the sharpened fragments. Probably some of the women would hunt good flints;they would fish them out of the chalk with sticks and bring them to thesquatting-place.There would be skins about. It seems probable that at a very early timeprimitive men took to using skins. Probably they were wrapped about thechildren, and used to lie upon when the ground was damp and cold. A woman wouldperhaps be preparing a skin. The inside of the skin would be well scraped freeof superfluous flesh with trimmed flints, and then strained and pulled andpegged out flat on the grass, and dried in the rays of the sun.Away from the fire other members of the family group prowl in search of food,but at night they all gather closely round the fire and build it up, for it istheir protection against the wandering bear and such-like beasts of prey. TheOld Man is the only fully adult male in the little group. There are women, boysand girls, but so soon as the boys are big enough to rouse the Old Man’sjealousy, he will fall foul of them and either drive them off or kill them. Somegirls may perhaps go off with these exiles, or two or three of these youths maykeep together for a time, wandering until they come upon some other group, fromwhich they may try to steal a mate. Then they would probably fall out amongthemselves. Someday, when he is forty years old perhaps or even older, and histeeth are worn down and his energy abating, some younger male will stand up tothe Old Man and kill him and reign in his stead. There is probably short shriftfor the old at the squatting-place. So soon as they grow weak and bad-tempered,trouble and death come upon them. EARLY STONE IMPLEMENTSThe Mousterian Age implements, and all above it, are those of Neanderthalmen or, possibly in the case of the rostro-carinates, of sub-men. The lower row(Reindeer Age) are the work of true men. The student should compare thisdiagram with the time diagram attached to chapter 7, § 1, and he should notethe relatively large size of the pre-human implements.035 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_035_r1.gif]What did they eat at the squatting-place?Primeval man is commonly described as a hunter of the great hairy mammoth, ofthe bear, and the lion, but it is in the highest degree improbable that thehuman savage ever hunted animals much larger than the hare, the rabbit, and therat. Man was probably the hunted rather than the hunter.036 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_036_r1.gif]The primeval savage was both herbivorous and carnivorous. He had for foodhazelnuts, beech-nuts, sweet chestnuts, earth-nuts, and acorns. He hadcrab-apples, wild pears, wild cherries, wild gooseberries, bullaces, sorbs,sloes, blackberries, yewberries, hips and haws, watercress, fungi, the largerand softer leaf-buds, Nostoc (the vegetable substance called “fallen stars” bycountryfolk), the fleshy, juicy, asparagus-like rhizomes or subterranean stemsof the Labiatœ and like plants, as well as other delicacies of the vegetablekingdom. He had birds’ eggs, young birds, and the honey and honeycomb of wildbees. He had newts, snails, and frogs—the two latter delicacies are still highlyesteemed in Normandy and Brittany. He had fish, dead and alive, and freshwatermussels; he could easily catch fish with his hands and paddle and dive for andtrap them. By the seaside he would have fish, mollusca, and seaweed. He wouldhave many of the larger birds and smaller mammals, which he could easily secureby throwing stones and sticks, or by setting simple snares. He would have thesnake, the slow worm, and the crayfish. He would have various grubs and insects,the large larvæ of beetles and various caterpillars. The taste for caterpillarsstill survives in China, where they are sold in dried bundles in the markets. Achief and highly nourishing object of food would doubtlessly be bones smashed upinto a stiff and gritty paste.A fact of great importance is this—primeval man would not be particular abouthaving his flesh food over-fresh. He would constantly find it in a dead state,and, if semi-putrid, he would relish it none the less—the taste for high orhalf-putrid game still survives. If driven by hunger and hard pressed, he wouldperhaps sometimes eat his weaker companions or unhealthy children who happenedto be feeble or unsightly or burthensome. The larger animals in a weak and dyingstate would no doubt be much sought for; when these were not forthcoming, deadand half-rotten examples would be made to suffice. An unpleasant odour would notbe objected to; it is not objected to now in many continental hotels.The savages sat huddled close together round their fire, with fruits, bones, andhalf-putrid flesh. We can imagine the old man and his women twitching the skinof their shoulders, brows, and muzzles as they were annoyed or bitten by fliesor other insects. We can imagine the large human nostrils, indicative of keenscent, giving rapidly repeated sniffs at the foul meat before it was consumed;the bad odour of the meat, and the various other disgusting odours belonging toa haunt of savages, being not in the least disapproved.Man at that time was not a degraded animal, for he had never been higher; he wastherefore an exalted animal, and, low as we esteem him now, he yet representedthe highest stage of development of the animal kingdom of his time.That is at least an acceptable sketch of a Neanderthal squatting-place Butbefore extinction overtook them, even the Neanderthalers learn much and wentfar.Whatever the older Palæolithic men did with their dead, there is reason tosuppose that the later Homo Neanderthalensis buried some individuals at leastwith respect and ceremony. One of the best-known Neanderthal skeletons is thatof a youth who apparently had been deliberately interred. He had been placed ina sleeping posture, head on the right forearm. The head lay on a number of flintfragments carefully piled together “pillow fashion.” A big hand-axe lay near hishead, and around him were numerous charred and split ox bones, as though therehad been a feast or an offering.To this appearance of burial during the later Neanderthal age we shall returnwhen we are considering the ideas that were inside the heads of primitive men.This sort of men may have wandered, squatted about their fires, and died inEurope for a period extending over 100,000 years, if we assume, that is, thatthe Heidelberg jawbone belongs to a member of the species, a period so vast thatall the subsequent history of our race becomes a thing of yesterday. Along itsown line this species of men was accumulating a dim tradition, and working outits limited possibilities. Its thick skull imprisoned its brain, and to the endit was low-browed and brutish."},{"pageContent":"037 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_037_r1.gif]CHAPTER NINE 038[bano_9781411428843_oeb_038_r1.gif]THE LATER POSTGLACIAL PALÆOLITHIC MEN, THE FIRST TRUE MEN(LATER PALÆOLITHIC AGE)§ 1. The Coming of Men Like Ourselves. § 2. Hunters Give Place to Herdsmen. § 3.No Sub-Men in America.§ 1THE NEANDERTHAL TYPE OF MAN PREVAILED IN EUROPE AT LEAST FOR tens of thousandsof years. For ages that make all history seem a thing of yesterday, these nearlyhuman creatures prevailed. If the Heidelberg jaw was that of a Neanderthaler,and if there is no error in the estimate of the age of that jaw, then theNeanderthal Race lasted out for more than 200,000 years! Finally, between 40,000and 25,000 years ago, as the Fourth Glacial Age softened towards more temperateconditions (see map on p. 63), a different human type came upon the scene, and,it would seem, exterminated Homo Neanderthalensis.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en13] This new type was probably developedin South Asia or North Africa, or in lands now sub-merged in the Mediterraneanbasin, and, as more remains are collected and evidence accumulates, men willlearn more of their early stages. At present we can only guess where and how,through the slow ages, parallel with the Neanderthal cousin, these first truemen arose out of some more ape-like progenitor. For hundreds of centuries theywere acquiring skill of hand and limb, and power and bulk of brain, in thatstill unknown environment. They were already far above the Neanderthal level ofachievement and intelligence, when first they come into our ken, and they hadalready split into two or more very distinctive races.These newcomers did not migrate into Europe in the strict sense of the word, butrather, as century by century the climate ameliorated, they followed the foodand plants to which they were accustomed, as those spread into the new realmsthat opened to them. The ice was receding, vegetation was increasing, big gameof all sorts was becoming more abundant. Steppe-like conditions, conditions ofpasture and shrub, were bringing with them vast herds of wild horse.Ethnologists (students of race) class these new human races in one same speciesas ourselves, and with all human races subsequent to them, under one commonspecific name of Homo sapiens. They had quite human brain-cases and hands. Theirteeth and their necks were anatomically as ours are.039 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_039_r1.gif]We know of two distinct sorts of skeletal remains in this period, the first ofthese known as the Cro-Magnon race, and the second the Grimaldi race; but thegreat bulk of the human traces and appliances we find are either without humanbones or with insufficient bones for us to define their associated physicaltype. There may have been many more distinct races than these two. There mayhave been intermediate types. In the grotto of Cro-Magnon it was that completeskeletons of one main type of these Newer Palæolithic men, these true men, werefirst found, and so it is that they are spoken of as Cro-Magnards.These Cro-Magnards were a tall people with very broad faces, prominent noses,and, all things considered, astonishingly big brains. The brain capacity of thewoman in the Cro-Magnon cave exceeded that of the average male today. Her headhad been smashed by a heavy blow. There were also in the same cave with her thecomplete skeleton of an older man, nearly six feet high, the fragments of achild’s skeleton, and the skeletons of two young men. There were also flintimplements and perforated seashells, used no doubt as ornaments. Such is onesample of the earliest true men. But at the Grimaldi cave, near Mentone, werediscovered two skeletons also of the later Palæolithic Period, but of a widelycontrasted type, with negroid characteristics that point rather to the negroidtype. There can be no doubt that we have to deal in this period with at leasttwo, and probably more, highly divergent races of true men. They may haveoverlapped in time, or Cro-Magnards may have followed the Grimaldi race, andeither or both may have been contemporary with the late Neanderthal men. Variousauthorities have very strong opinions upon these points, but they are, at most,opinions.040 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_040_r1.gif] MAP SHOWING EUROPE AND WESTERN ASIA ABOUT THE TIME TRUE MEN WERE REPLACING THENEANDERTHALERS IN WESTERN EUROPE.041 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_041_r1.gif]The appearance of these truly human postglacial Palæolithic peoples wascertainly an enormous leap forward in the history of mankind. Both of these mainraces had a human forebrain, a human hand, an intelligence very like our own.They dispossessed Homo Neanderthalensis from his caverns and his stone quarries.And they agreed with modern ethnologists, it would seem, in regarding him as adifferent species. Unlike most savage conquerors, who take the women of thedefeated side for their own and interbreed with them, it would seem that thetrue men would have nothing to do with the Neanderthal race, women or men. Thereis no trace of any intermixture between the races, in spite of the fact that thenewcomers, being also flint users, were establishing themselves in the very samespots that their predecessors had occupied. We know nothing of the appearance ofthe Neanderthal man, but this absence of intermixture seems to suggest anextreme hairiness, an ugliness, or a repulsive strangeness in his appearanceover and above his low forehead, his beetle brows, his ape neck, and hisinferior stature. Or he—and she—may have been too fierce to tame. Says Sir HarryJohnston, in a survey of the rise of modern man in his Views and Reviews: “Thedim racial remembrance of such gorilla-like monsters, with cunning brains,shambling gait, hairy bodies, strong teeth, and possibly cannibalistictendencies, may be the germ of the ogre in folklore. . . .”These true men of the Palæolithic Age, who replaced the Neanderthalers, werecoming into a milder climate, and although they used the caves and shelters oftheir predecessors, they lived largely in the open. They were hunting peoples,and some or all of them appear to have hunted the mammoth and the wild horse aswell as the reindeer, bison, and aurochs. They ate much horse. At a greatopen-air camp at Solutré, where they seem to have had annual gatherings for manycenturies, it is estimated that there are the bones of one hundred thousandhorses, besides reindeer, mammoth, and bison bones. They probably followed herdsof horses, the little bearded ponies of that age, as these moved after pasture.They hung about on the flanks of the herd, and became very wise about its habitsand dispositions. A large part of these men’s lives must have been spent inwatching animals.Whether they tamed and domesticated the horse is still an open question. Perhapsthey learnt to do so by degrees as the centuries passed. At any rate, we findlate Palæolithic drawings of horses with marks about the heads that are stronglysuggestive of bridles, and there exists a carving of a horse’s head showing whatis perhaps a rope of twisted skin or tendon. But even if they tamed the horse,it is still more doubtful whether they rode it or had much use for it when itwas tamed. The horse they knew was a wild pony with a beard under its chin, notup to carrying a man for any distance. It is improbable that these men had yetlearnt the rather unnatural use of animal’s milk as food. If they tamed thehorse at last, it was the only animal they seem to have tamed. They had no dogs,and they had little to do with any sort of domesticated sheep or cattle.It greatly aids us to realize their common humanity that these earliest true mencould draw. Both races, it would seem, drew astonishingly well. They were by allstandards savages, but they were artistic savages. They drew better than any oftheir successors down to the beginnings of history. They drew and painted on thecliffs and cave walls that they had wrested from the Neanderthal men. And thesurviving drawings come to the ethnologist, puzzling over bones and scraps, withthe effect of a plain message shining through guesswork and darkness. They drewon bones and antlers; they carved little figures.These later Palæolithic people not only drew remarkably well for ourinformation, and with an increasing skill as the centuries passed, but they havealso left us other information about their lives in their graves. They buried.They buried their dead, often with ornaments, weapons, and food; they used a lotof colour in the burial, and evidently painted the body. From that one may inferthat they painted their bodies during life. Paint was a big fact in their lives.They were inveterate painters; they used black, brown, red, yellow, and whitepigments, and the pigments they used endure to this day in the caves of Franceand Spain. Of all modern races, none have shown so pictorial a disposition; thenearest approach to it has been among the American Indians.These drawings and paintings of the later Palæolithic people went on through along period of time, and present wide fluctuations in artistic merit. We givehere some early sketches, from which we learn of the interest taken by theseearly men in the bison, horse, ibex, cave bear, and reindeer. In its earlystages the drawing is often primitive like the drawing of clever children;quadrupeds are usually drawn with one hind-leg and one fore-leg, as childrendraw them to this day. The legs on the other side were too much for the artist’stechnique. Possibly the first drawings began as children’s drawings begin, outof idle scratchings. The savage scratched with a flint on a smooth rock surface,and was reminded of some line or gesture. But their solid carvings are at leastas old as their first pictures. The earlier drawings betray a completeincapacity to group animals. As the centuries progressed, more skilful artistsappeared. The representation of beasts became at last astonishingly vivid andlike. But even at the crest of their artistic time they still drew in profile aschildren do; perspective and the fore-shortening needed for back and front viewswere too much for them.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en14] They rarelydrew themselves. The vast majority of their drawings represent animals. Themammoth and the horse are among the commonest themes. Some of the people,whether Grimaldi people or Cro-Magnon people, also made little ivory andsoapstone statuettes, and among these are some very fat female figures. Theselatter suggest the physique of Grimaldi rather than of Cro-Magnon artists. Theyare like Bushmen women. The human sculpture of the earlier times inclined tocaricature, and generally such human figures as they represent are far below theanimal studies in vigour and veracity.042 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_042_r1.gif]043 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_043_r1.gif]Later on there was more grace and less coarseness in the human representations.One little ivory head discovered is that of a girl with an elaborate coiffure.These people at a later stage also scratched and engraved designs on ivory andbone. Some of the most interesting groups of figures are carved very curiouslyround bone, and especially round rods of deer bone, so that it is impossible tosee the entire design altogether. Figures have also been found modelled in clay,although no Palæolithic people made any use of pottery.Many of the paintings are found in the depths of unlit caves. They are oftendifficult of access. The artists must have employed lamps to do their work, andshallow soapstone lamps in which fat could have been burnt have been found.Whether the seeing of these cavern paintings was in some way ceremonial or underwhat circumstances they were seen, we are now altogether at a loss to imagine.At last it would seem that circumstances began to turn altogether against thesehunting Newer Palæolithic people who had flourished for so long in Europe. Theydisappeared. New kinds of men appeared in Europe, replacing them. These latterseem to have brought in bow and arrows; they had domesticated animals andcultivated the soil. A new way of living, the Neolithic way of living, spreadover the European area; and the life of the Reindeer Age and of the races ofReindeer men, the Later Palæolithic men, after a reign vastly greater than thetime between ourselves and the very earliest beginnings of recorded history,passed off the European stage.§ 2It was about 12,000 or fewer years ago that, with the spread of forests and agreat change of the fauna, the long prevalence of the hunting life in Europedrew to its end. Reindeer vanished. Changing conditions frequently bring withthem new diseases. There may have been prehistoric pestilences. For manycenturies there may have been no men in Britain or Central Europe (Wright). Fora time there were in Southern Europe drifting communities of some little knownpeople who are called the Azilians.3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en15]They may have been transition generations; they may have been a different race.We do not know. Some authorities incline to the view that the Azilians were thefirst wave of a race which, as we shall see later, has played a great part inpopulating Europe, the dark-white or Mediterranean or Iberian race. TheseAzilian people have left behind them a multitude of pebbles, roughly daubed withmarkings of an unknown purport (see illus. p. 67). The use or significance ofthese Azilian pebbles is still a profound mystery. Was this some sort of tokenwriting? Were they counters in some game? Did the Azilians play with thesepebbles or tell a story with them, as imaginative children will do with bits ofwood and stone nowadays? At present we are unable to cope with any of thesequestions.We will not deal here with the other various peoples who left their scantytraces in the world during the close of the New Palæolithic period, the spreadof the forests where formerly there had been steppes, and the wane of thehunters, some 10,000 or 12,000 years ago. We will go on to describe the new sortof human community that was now spreading over the northern hemisphere, whoseappearance marks what is called the Neolithic Age. The map of the world wasassuming something like its present outlines, the landscape and the flora andfauna were taking on their existing characteristics. The prevailing animals inthe spreading woods of Europe were the royal stag, the great ox, and the bison;the mammoth and the musk ox had gone. The great ox, or aurochs, is now extinct,but it survived in the German forests up to the time of the Roman Empire. It wasnever domesticated.4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en16] It stood elevenfeet high at the shoulder, as high as an elephant. There were still lions in theBalkan peninsula, and they remained there until about 1000 or 1200 BC. The lionsof Würtemberg and South Germany in those days were twice the size of the modernlion. South Russia and Central Asia were thickly wooded then, and there wereelephants in Mesopotamia and Syria, and a fauna in Algeria that was tropicalAfrican in character.Hitherto men in Europe had never gone farther north than the Baltic Sea or theBritish Isles, but now the Scandinavian peninsula and perhaps Great Russia werebecoming possible regions for human occupation. There are no Palæolithic remainsin Sweden or Norway. Man, when he entered these countries, was apparentlyalready at the Neolithic stage of social development.§ 3Nor is there any convincing evidence of man in America before the end of thePleistocene.5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en17] The same relaxation ofthe climate that permitted the retreat of the reindeer hunters into Russia andSiberia, as the Neolithic tribes advanced, may have allowed them to wanderacross the land that is now cut by Bering Strait, and so reach the Americancontinent. They spread thence southward, age by age. When they reached SouthAmerica, they found the giant sloth (the Megatherium), the glyptodon, and manyother extinct creatures, still flourishing. The glyptodon was a monstrous SouthAmerican armadillo, and a human skeleton has been found by Roth buried beneathits huge tortoise-like shell.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en18]All the human remains in America, even the earliest, it is to be noted, are ofan Amer-Indian character. In America there does not seem to have been anypreceding races of sub-men. Man was fully man when he entered America. The oldworld was the nursery of the sub-races of mankind."},{"pageContent":"044 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_044_r1.gif]CHAPTER TEN 045[bano_9781411428843_oeb_045_r1.gif]NEOLITHIC MAN IN EUROPE§ 1. THE AGE OF CULTIVATION BEGINS. § 2. WHERE DID THE NEOLITHIC CULTURE ARISE?§ 3. EVERYDAY NEOLITHIC LIFE. § 4. PRIMITIVE TRADE. § 5. THE FLOODING OF THEMEDITERRANEAN VALLEY.§ 1THE NEOLITHIC PHASE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS BEGAN IN EUROPE ABOUT 10,000 or 12,000years ago. But probably men had reached the Neolithic stage elsewhere somethousands of years earlier. Neolithic men came slowly into Europe from the southor southeast as the reindeer and the open steppes gave way to forest and modernEuropean conditions.The Neolithic stage in culture is characterized by:1. the presence of polished stone implements, and in particular the stone axe,which was perforated so as to be the more effectually fastened to a woodenhandle, and which was probably used rather for working wood than in conflict.There are also abundant arrow-heads. The fact that some implements are polisheddoes not preclude the presence of great quantities of implements of unpolishedstone. But there are differences in the make between even the unpolished toolsof the Neolithic and of the Palæolithic Period.2. The beginning of a sort of agriculture, and the use of plants and seeds. Butat first there are abundant evidences that hunting was still of great importancein the Neolithic Age. Neolithic man did not at first sit down to hisagriculture. He took snatch crops. He settled later.3. Pottery and proper cooking. The horse is no longer eaten.4. Domesticated animals. The dog appears very early. The Neolithic man haddomesticated cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. He was a huntsman turned herdsmanof the herds he once hunted.5. Plaiting and weaving.These Neolithic people probably “migrated” into Europe, in the same way that theReindeer Men had migrated before them; that is to say, generation by generationand century by century, as the climate changed, they spread after theiraccustomed food. They were not “nomads.” Nomadism, like civilization, had stillto be developed. At present we are quite unable to estimate how far theNeolithic peoples were newcomers and how far their arts were developed oracquired by the descendants of some of the hunters and fishers of the LaterPalæolithic Age.Whatever our conclusions in that matter, this much we may say with certainty;there is no great break, no further sweeping away of one kind of man andreplacement by another kind between the appearance of the Neolithic way ofliving and our own time. There are invasions, conquests, extensive emigrationsand intermixtures, but the races as a whole carry on and continue to adaptthemselves to the areas into which they began to settle in the opening of theNeolithic Age. The Neolithic men of Europe were white men ancestral to themodern Europeans. They may have been of a darker complexion than many of theirdescendants; of that we cannot speak with certainty. But there is no real breakin culture from their time onward until we reach the age of coal, steam, andpower-driven machinery that began in the eighteenth century.After a long time gold, the first known of the metals, appears among the boneornaments with jet and amber. Irish Neolithic remains are particularly rich ingold. Then, perhaps 60,00 or 70,00 years ago in Europe, Neolithic people beganto use copper in certain centres, making out of it implements of much the samepattern as their stone ones. They cast the copper in moulds made to the shape ofthe stone implements. Possibly they first found native copper and hammered itinto shape.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en19] Later—we will not ventureupon figures—men had found out how to get copper from its ore. Perhaps, as LordAvebury suggested, they discovered the secret of smelting by the chance puttingof lumps of copper ore among the ordinary stones with which they built the firepits they used for cooking. In China, Hungary, Cornwall, and elsewhere copperore and tinstone occur in the same veins; it is a very common association, andso, rather through dirtiness than skill, the ancient smelters, it may be, hitupon the harder and better bronze, which is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronzeis not only harder than copper, but the mixture of tin and copper is morefusible and easier to reduce. The so-called “pure-copper” implements usuallycontain a small proportion of tin, and there are no tin implements known, norvery much evidence to show that early men knew of tin as a separate metal.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en20]3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en21] The plant of a prehistoric coppersmelter has been found in Spain, and the material of bronze foundries in variouslocalities. The method of smelting revealed by these finds carries out LordAvebury’s suggestion. In India, where zinc and copper ore occur together, brass(which is an alloy of the two metals) was similarly hit upon.046 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_046_r1.gif]So slight was the change in fashions and methods produced by the appearance ofbronze, that for a long time such bronze axes and so forth as were made werecast in moulds to the shape of the stone implements they were superseding.Finally, perhaps as early as 3,000 years ago in Europe, and even earlier in AsiaMinor, men began to smelt iron. Once smelting was known to men, there is nogreat marvel in the finding of iron. They smelted iron by blowing up a charcoalfire, and wrought it by heating and hammering. They produced it at first incomparatively small pieces;4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en22] itsappearance worked a gradual revolution in weapons and implements; but it did notsuffice to change the general character of men’s surroundings. Much the samedaily life that was being led by the more settled Neolithic men 10,000 yearsago, was being led by peasants in out-of-the-way places all over Europe at thebeginning of the eighteenth century.People talk of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age in Europe, but itis misleading to put these ages as if they were of equal importance in history.Much truer is it to say that there was:1. An Early Palæolithic Age, of vast duration;2. a Later Palæolithic Age, that lasted not a tithe of the time; and3. the Age of Cultivation, the age of the white men in Europe, which began10,000 or at most 12,000 years ago, of which the Neolithic Period was thebeginning, and which is still going on.§ 2We do not know yet the region in which the ancestors of the brownish Neolithicpeoples worked their way up from the Palæolithic stage of human development.Probably it was somewhere about southwestern Asia, or in some region nowsubmerged beneath the Mediterranean Sea or the Indian Ocean, that, while theNeanderthal men still lived their hard lives in the bleak climate of a glaciatedEurope, the ancestors of the white men developed the rude arts of their LaterPalæolithic period. But they do not seem to have developed the artistic skill oftheir more northerly kindred, the European Later Palæolithic races. And throughthe hundred centuries or so while Reindeer men were living under comparativelyunprogressive conditions upon the steppes of France, Germany, and Spain, thesemore favoured and progressive people to the south were mastering agriculture,learning to develop their appliances, taming the dog, domesticating cattle, and,as the climate to the north mitigated and the equatorial climate grew moretropical, spreading northward. All these early chapters of our story have yet tobe disinterred. They will probably be found in Asia Minor, Persia, Arabia,India, or north Africa, or they lie beneath the Mediterranean waters. Twelvethousand years ago, or thereabouts—we are still too early for anything but theroughest chronology—Neolithic peoples were scattered all over Europe, northAfrica, and Asia. They were peoples at about the level of many of the Polynesianislanders of the last century, and they were the most advanced peoples in theworld.§ 3It will be of interest here to give a brief account of the life of the EuropeanNeolithic people before the appearance of metals. We get our light upon thatlife from various sources. They scattered their refuse about, and in some places(e.g., on the Danish coast) it accumulated in great heaps, known as thekitchen-middens. They buried some of their people, but not the common herd, withgreat care and distinction, and made huge heaps of earth over their sepulchres;these heaps are the barrows or dolmens which contribute a feature to theEuropean, Indian, and American scenery in many districts to this day. Inconnection with these mounds, or independently of them, they set up great stones(megaliths), either singly or in groups, of which Stonehenge in Wiltshire andCarnac in Brittany are among the best-known examples. In various places theirvillages are still traceable.One fruitful source of knowledge about Neolithic life comes from Switzerland,and was first revealed by the very dry winter of 1854, when the water level ofone of the lakes, sinking to an unheard-of lowness, revealed the foundations ofprehistoric pile dwellings of the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages, built outover the water after the fashion of similar homes that exist today in Celebesand elsewhere. Not only were the timbers of those ancient platforms preserved,but a great multitude of wooden, bone, stone, and earthenware utensils andornaments, remains of food and the like, were found in the peaty accumulationsbelow them. Even pieces of net and garments have been recovered. Similar lakedwellings existed in Scotland, Ireland, and elsewhere—there are well-knownremains at Glastonbury in Somersetshire; in Ireland lake dwellings wereinhabited from prehistoric times up to the days when O’Neil of Tyrone wasfighting against the English before the plantation of Scotch colonists toreplace the Irish in Ulster in the reign of James I of England. These lakevillages had considerable defensive value, and there was a sanitary advantage inliving over flowing water.047 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_047_r1.gif]Probably these Neolithic Swiss pile dwellings did not shelter the largestcommunities that existed in those days. They were the homes of small patriarchalgroups. Elsewhere upon fertile plains and in more open country there wereprobably already much larger assemblies of homes than in those mountain valleys.There are traces of such a large community of families in Wiltshire in England,for example; the remains of the stone circle of Avebury near Silbury mound wereonce the “finest megalithic ruin in Europe.” It consisted of two circles ofstones surrounded by a larger circle and a ditch, and covering altogethertwenty-eight and a half acres. From it two avenues of stones, each a mile and ahalf long, ran west and south on either side of Silbury Hill. Silbury Hill isthe largest prehistoric artificial mound in England. The dimensions of thiscentre of a faith and a social life now forgotten altogether by men indicate theconcerted efforts and interests of a very large number of people, widelyscattered though they may have been over the west and south and centre ofEngland. Possibly they assembled at some particular season of the year in aprimitive sort of fair. The whole community “lent a hand” in building the moundsand hauling the stones. The Swiss pile dwellers, on the contrary, seem to havelived in practically self-contained villages.These lake-village people were considerably more advanced in methods andknowledge, and probably much later in time than the early Neolithic people whoaccumulated the shell mounds, known as kitchen-middens, on the Danish and Scotchcoasts. These kitchen-midden folk may have been as early as 10000 BC or earlier;the lake dwellings were probably occupied continuously from 5000 or 4000 BC downalmost to historic times. Those early kitchen-midden people were among the mostbarbaric of Neolithic peoples, their stone axes were rough, and they had nodomesticated animal except the dog. The lake dwellers, on the other hand, had,in addition to the dog, which was of a medium-sized breed, oxen, goats, andsheep. Later on, as they were approaching the Bronze Age, they got swine. Theremains of cattle and goats prevail in their débris, and, having regard to theclimate and country about them, it seems probable that these beasts weresheltered in the buildings upon the piles in winter, and that fodder was storedfor them. Probably the beasts lived in the same houses with the people, as themen and beasts do now in Swiss chalets. The people in the houses possibly milkedthe cows and goats, and milk perhaps played as important a part in their economyas it does in that of the mountain Swiss of today. But of that we are not sureat present. Milk is not a natural food for adults; it must have seemed queerstuff to take at first; and it may have been only after much breeding that acontinuous supply of milk was secured from cows and goats. Some people thinkthat the use of milk, cheese, butter, and other milk products came later intohuman life when men became nomadic. The writer is, however, disposed to give theNeolithic men credit for having discovered milking. The milk, if they did use it(and, no doubt, in that case sour curdled milk also, but not well-made cheeseand butter), they must have kept in earthenware pots, for they had pottery,though it was roughly handmade pottery and not the shapely product of thepotter’s wheel. They eked out this food supply by hunting. They killed and atered deer and roe deer, bison and wild boar. And they ate the fox, a ratherhigh-flavoured meat, and not what anyone would eat in a world of plenty. Oddlyenough, they do not seem to have eaten the hare, although it was available asfood. They are supposed to have avoided eating it, as some savages are said toavoid eating it to this day, because they feared that the flesh of so timid acreature might make them, by a sort of infection, cowardly.5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en23]Of their agricultural methods we know very little. No ploughs and no hoes havebeen found. They were of wood and have perished. Neolithic men cultivated andate wheat, barley, and millet, but they knew nothing of oats or rye. Their grainthey roasted, ground between stones and stored in pots, to be eaten when needed.And they made exceedingly solid and heavy bread, because round flat slabs of ithave been got out of these deposits. Apparently they had no yeast. If they hadno yeast, then they had no fermented drink. One sort of barley that they had isthe sort that was cultivated by the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians, andthey also had an Egyptian variety of wheat, showing that their ancestors hadbrought or derived this cultivation from the southeast. The centre of diffusionof wheat was somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean region. A wild form is stillfound in the neighbourhood of Mt. Hermon (see footnote to Chap. XIV, § 1). Whenthe lake dwellers sowed their little patches of wheat in Switzerland, they werealready following the immemorial practice of mankind. The seed must have beenbrought age by age from that distant centre of diffusion. In the ancestral landsof the southeast men had already been sowing wheat perhaps for thousands ofyears.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en24] Those lake dwellers also atepeas, and crab-apples—the only apples that then existed in the world.Cultivation and selection had not yet produced the apple of today.They dressed chiefly in skins, but they also made a rough cloth of flax.Fragments of that flaxen cloth have been discovered. Their nets were made offlax; they had as yet no knowledge of hemp and hempen rope. With the coming ofbronze, their pins and ornaments increased in number. There is reason to believethey set great store upon their hair, wearing it in large shocks with pins ofbone and afterwards of metal. To judge from the absence of realistic carvings orengravings or paintings, they either did not decorate their garments ordecorated them with plaids, spots, interlacing designs, or similar conventionalornament. Before the coming of bronze there is no evidence of stools or tables;the Neolithic people probably squatted on their clay floors. There were no catsin these lake dwellings; no mice or rats had yet adapted themselves to humandwellings; the cluck of the hen was not as yet added to the sounds of humanlife, nor the domestic egg to its diet.7[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en25]The chief tool and weapon of Neolithic man was his axe; his next the bow andarrow. His arrow-heads were of flint, beautifully made, and he lashed themtightly to their shafts. Probably he prepared the ground for his sowing with apole, or a pole upon which he had stuck a stag’s horn. Fish he hooked orharpooned. These implements no doubt stood about in the interior of the house,from the walls of which hung his fowling-nets. On the floor, which was of clayor trodden cow-dung (after the fashion of hut floors in India today), stood potsand jars and woven baskets containing grain, milk, and such-like food. Some ofthe pots and pans hung by rope loops to the walls. At one end of the room, andhelping to keep it warm in winter by their animal heat, stabled the beasts. Thechildren took the cows and goats out to graze, and brought them in at nightbefore the wolves and bears came prowling.Since Neolithic man had the bow, he probably also had stringed instruments, forthe rhythmic twanging of a bowstring seems almost inevitably to lead to that. Healso had earthenware drums across which skins were stretched; perhaps also hemade drums by stretching skins over hollow tree stems.8[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en26] We do not know when man began to sing,but evidently he was making music, and since he had words, songs were no doubtbeing made. To begin with, perhaps, he just let his voice loose as one may hearItalian peasants now behind their ploughs singing songs without words. Afterdark in the winter he sat in his house and talked and sang and made implementsby touch rather than sight. His lighting must have been poor, and chieflyfirelight, but there was probably always some fire in the village, summer orwinter. Fire was too troublesome to make for men to be willing to let it outreadily. Sometimes a great disaster happened to those pile villages, the firegot free, and they were burnt out. The Swiss deposits contain clear evidence ofsuch catastrophes.048 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_048_r1.gif]All this we gather from the remains of the Swiss pile dwellings, and such wasthe character of the human life that spread over Europe, coming from the southand from the east with the forests as, 10,000 or 12,000 years ago, the reindeerand the Reindeer men passed away. It is evident that we have here a way of lifealready separated by a great gap of thousands of years of invention from itsoriginal Palæolithic stage. The steps by which it rose from that condition wecan only guess at. From being a hunter hovering upon the outskirts of flocks andherds of wild cattle and sheep, and from being a co-hunter with the dog, man byinsensible degrees may have developed a sense of proprietorship in the beastsand struck up a friendship with his canine competitor. He learnt to turn thecattle when they wandered too far; he brought his better brain to bear to guidethem to fresh pasture. He hemmed the beasts into valleys and enclosures where hecould be sure to find them again. He fed them when they starved, and so slowlyhe tamed them. Perhaps his agriculture began with the storage of fodder. Hereaped, no doubt, before he sowed. The Palæolithic ancestor away in that unknownland of origin to the southeast first supplemented the precarious meat supply ofthe hunter by eating roots and fruits and wild grains. Man storing graminiferousgrasses for his cattle might easily come to beat out the grain for himself.§ 4All these early beginnings must have taken place far back in time, arid inregions of the world that have still to be effectively explored by thearchæologists. They were probably going on in Asia or Africa, in what is now thebed of the Mediterranean, or in the region of the Indian Ocean, while theReindeer man was developing his art in Europe. The Neolithic men who driftedover Europe and Western Asia 12,000 or 10,000 years ago were long past thesebeginnings; they were already close, a few thousand years, to the dawn ofwritten tradition and the remembered history of mankind. Without any very greatshock or break, bronze came at last into human life, giving a great advantage inwarfare to those tribes who first obtained it. Written history had already begunbefore weapons of iron came into Europe to supersede bronze.Already in those days a sort of primitive trade had sprung up. Bronze and bronzeweapons, and such rare and hard stones as jade, gold because of its plastic andornamental possibilities, and skins and flax-net and cloth, were being swappedand stolen and passed from hand to hand over great stretches of country. Saltalso was probably being traded. On a meat dietary men can live without salt, butgrain-consuming people need it just as herbivorous animals need it. Hopf saysthat bitter tribal wars have been carried on by the desert tribes of the Soudanin recent years for the possession of the salt deposits between Fezzan andMurzuk. To begin with, barter, blackmail, tribute, and robbery by violencepassed into each other by insensible degrees. Men got what they wanted by suchmeans as they could.§ 5So far we have been telling of a history without events, a history of ages andperiods and stages in development. But before we conclude this portion of thehuman story, we must record what was probably an event of primary importance andat first perhaps of tragic importance to developing mankind, and that was thebreaking in of the Atlantic waters to the great Mediterranean valley.The reader must keep in mind that we are endeavouring to give him plainstatements that he can take hold of comfortably. But both in the matter of ourtime charts and the three maps we have given of prehistoric geography there isnecessarily much speculative matter. We have dated the last Glacial Age and theappearance of the true men as about 40000 or 35,000 years ago. Please bear that“about” in mind. The truth may be 60,000 or 20,000. But it is no good saying “avery long time” or “ages” ago, because then the reader will not know whether wemean centuries or millions of years. And similarly in these maps we give, theyrepresent not the truth, but something like the truth. The outline of the landwas “some such outline.” There were such seas and such land masses. But both Mr.Horrabin, who has drawn these maps, and I, who have incited him to do so, havepreferred to err on the timid side. We are not geologists enough to launch outinto original research in these matters, and so we have stuck to the 40-fathomline and the recent deposits as our guides for our postglacial map and for themap of 12000 to 10000 BC. But in one matter we have gone beyond these guides. Itis practically certain that at the end of the last Glacial Age the Mediterraneanwas a couple of land-locked sea basins, not connected—or only connected by atorrential overflow river. The eastern basin was the fresher; it was fed by theNile, the “Adriatic” river, the “Red-Sea” river, and perhaps by a river thatpoured down amidst the mountains that are now the Greek Archipelago from thevery much bigger Sea of Central Asia that then existed. Almost certainly humanbeings, and possibly even Neolithic men, wandered over that now lostMediterranean valley.The reasons for believing this are very good and plain. To this day theMediterranean is a sea of evaporation. The rivers that flow into it do not makeup for the evaporation from its surface. There is a constant current of waterpouring into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, and another current streamingin from the Bosporus and Black Sea. For the Black Sea gets more water than itneeds from the big rivers that flow into it; it is an overflowing sea, while theMediterranean is a thirsty sea. From which it must be plain that when theMediterranean was cut off both from the Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea it musthave been a shrinking sea with its waters sinking to a much lower level thanthose of the ocean outside. This is the case of the Caspian Sea today. Stillmore so is it the case with the Dead Sea.But if this reasoning is sound, then where today roll the blue waters of theMediterranean there must once have been great areas of land, and land with avery agreeable climate. This was probably the case during the last Glacial Age,and we do not know how near it was to our time when the change occurred thatbrought back the ocean waters into the Mediterranean basin. Certainly there musthave been Grimaldi people, and perhaps even Azilian and Neolithic people goingabout in the valleys and forests of these regions that are now submerged. TheNeolithic Dark Whites, the people of the Mediterranean race, may have gone fartowards the beginnings of settlement and civilization in that great lostMediterranean valley.Mr. W. B. Wright9 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en27] gives us some verystimulating suggestions here. He suggests that in the Mediterranean basin therewere two lakes,. . . one a freshwater lake, in the eastern depression, which drained into theother in the western depression. It is interesting to think what must havehappened when the ocean level rose once more as a result of the dissipation ofthe ice-sheets, and its waters began to pour over into the Mediterranean area.The inflow, small at first, must have ultimately increased to enormousdimensions, as the channel was slowly lowered by erosion and the ocean levelslowly rose. If there were any unconsolidated materials on the sill of theStrait, the result must have been a genuine debacle, and if we consider thelength of time which even an enormous torrent would take to fill such a basin asthat of the Mediterranean, we must conclude that this result was likely to havebeen attained in any case. Now, this may seem all the wildest speculation, butit is not entirely so, for if we examine a submarine contour map of the Straitsof Gibraltar, we find there is an enormous valley running up from theMediterranean deep, right through the Straits, and trenching some distance outon to the Atlantic shelf. This valley or gorge is probably the work of theinflowing waters of the ocean at the termination of the period of interiordrainage.This refilling of the Mediterranean, which by the rough chronology we areemploying in this book may have happened somewhen between 30000 and 10000 BC,must have been one of the greatest single events in the prehistory of our race.If the later date is the truer, then, as the reader will see plainly enoughafter reading the next two chapters, the crude beginnings of civilization, thefirst lake dwellings and the first cultivation, were probably round that easternLevantine Lake into which there flowed not only the Nile, but the two greatrivers that are now the Adriatic and the Red Sea. Suddenly the ocean watersbegan to break through over the westward hills and to pour in upon theseprimitive peoples—the lake that had been their home and friend became theirenemy; its waters rose and never abated; their settlements were submerged; thewaters pursued them in their flight. Day by day and year by year the watersspread up the valleys and drove mankind before them. Many must have beensurrounded and caught by the continually rising salt flood. It knew no check; itcame faster and faster; it rose over the tree-tops, over the hills, until it hadfilled the whole basin of the present Mediterranean and until it lapped themountain cliffs of Arabia and Africa. Far away, long before the dawn of history,this catastrophe occurred."},{"pageContent":"049 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_049_r1.gif]CHAPTER ELEVEN 050[bano_9781411428843_oeb_050_r1.gif]EARLY THOUGHT§ 1. PRIMITIVE PHILOSOPHY. § 2. THE OLD MAN IN RELIGION. § 3. FEAR AND HOPE INRELIGION. § 4. STARS AND SEASONS. § 5. STORYTELLING AND MYTH-MAKING. § 6.COMPLEX ORIGINS OF RELIGION.§ 1BEFORE WE GO ON TO TELL HOW 6,000 OR 7,000 YEARS AGO MEN BEGAN to gather intothe first towns and to develop something more than the loose-knit tribes thathad hitherto been their highest political association, something must be saidabout the things that were going on inside these brains of which we have tracedthe growth and development through a period of 500,000 years from the ape-manstage.What was man thinking about himself and about the world in those remote days?At first he thought very little about anything but immediate things. At first hewas busy thinking such things as: “Here is a bear; what shall I do?” Or “Thereis a squirrel; how can I get it?” Until language had developed to some extentthere could have been little thinking beyond the range of actual experience, forlanguage is the instrument of thought as book-keeping is the instrument ofbusiness. It records and fixes and enables thought to get on to more and morecomplex ideas. It is the hand of the mind to hold and keep. Primordial man,before he could talk, probably saw very vividly, mimicked very cleverly,gestured, laughed, danced, and lived, without much speculation about whence hecame or why he lived. He feared the dark, no doubt, and thunderstorms and biganimals and queer things and whatever he dreamt about, and no doubt he didthings to propitiate what he feared or to change his luck and please theimaginary powers in rock and beast and river. He made no clear distinctionbetween animate and inanimate things; if a stick hurt him, he kicked it; if theriver foamed and flooded, he thought it was hostile. His thought was probablyvery much at the level of a bright little contemporary boy of four or five. Hehad the same subtle unreasonableness of transition and the same limitations. Butsince he had little or no speech he would do little to pass on the fancies thatcame to him, and develop any tradition or concerted acts about them.The drawings even of Late Palæolithic man do not suggest that he paid anyattention to sun or moon or stars or trees. He was preoccupied only with animalsand men. Probably he took day and night, sun and stars, trees and mountains, asbeing in the nature of things—as a child takes its meal times and its nurserystaircase for granted. So far as we can judge, he drew no fantasies, no ghostsor anything of that sort. The Reindeer men’s drawings are fearless familiarthings, with no hint about them of any religious or occult feelings. There isscarcely anything that we can suppose to be a religious or mystical symbol atall in his productions. No doubt he had a certain amount of what is calledfetishism in his life; he did things we should now think unreasonable to producedesired ends, for that is all fetishism amounts to; it is only incorrect sciencebased on guesswork or false analogy, and entirely different in its nature fromreligion. No doubt he was excited by his dreams, and his dreams mixed up attimes in his mind with his waking impressions and puzzled him. Since he buriedhis dead, and since even the later Neanderthal men seem to have buried theirdead, and apparently with food and weapons, it has been argued that he had abelief in a future life. But it is just as reasonable to suppose that early menburied their dead with food and weapons because they doubted if they were dead,which is not the same thing as believing them to have immortal spirits, and thattheir belief in their continuing vitality was reinforced by dreams of thedeparted. They may have ascribed a sort of werewolf existence to the dead, andwished to propitiate them. The Reindeer man, we feel, was too intelligent andtoo like ourselves not to have had some speech, but quite probably it was notvery serviceable for anything beyond direct statement or matter-of-factnarrative. He lived in a larger community than the Neanderthaler, but how largewe do not know. Except when game is swarming, hunting communities must not keeptogether in large bodies or they will starve. The Indians who depend upon thecaribou in Labrador must be living under circumstances rather like those of theReindeer men. They scatter in small family groups, as the caribou scatter insearch of food; but when the deer collect for the seasonal migration, theIndians also collect. That is the time for trade and feasts and marriages. Thesimplest American Indian is 10,000 years more sophisticated than the Reindeerman, but probably that sort of gathering and dispersal was also the way ofReindeer men. At Solutré in France there are traces of a great camping andfeasting place. There was no doubt an exchange of news there, but one may doubtif there was anything like an exchange of ideas. One sees no scope in such alife for theology or philosophy or superstition or speculation. Fears, yes; butunsystematic fears; fancies and freaks of the imagination, but personal andtransitory freaks and fancies.Perhaps there was a certain power of suggestion in these encounters. A fearreally felt needs few words for its transmission; a value set upon something maybe very simply conveyed.In these questions of primitive thought and religion, we must remember that thelowly and savage peoples of today probably throw very little light on the mentalstate of men before the days of fully developed language. Primordial man couldhave had little or no tradition before the development of speech. All savage andprimitive peoples of today, on the contrary, are soaked in tradition—thetradition of thousands of generations. They may have weapons like their remoteancestors and methods like them, but what were slight and shallow impressions onthe minds of their predecessors are now deep and intricate grooves wornthroughout the intervening centuries generation by generation.§ 2Certain very fundamental things there may have been in men’s minds long beforethe coming of speech. Chief among these must have been fear of the Old Man ofthe tribe. The young of the primitive squatting-place grew up under that fear.Objects associated with him were probably forbidden. Everyone was forbidden totouch his spear or to sit in his place, just as today little boys must not touchfather’s pipe or sit in his chair. He was probably the master of all the women.The youths of the little community had to remember that. The idea of somethingforbidden, the idea of things being, as it is called, tabu, not to be touched,not to be looked at, may thus have got well into the human mind at a very earlystage indeed. J. J. Atkinson, in his Primal Law, an ingenious analysis of theseprimitive tabus which are found among savage peoples all over the world, thetabus that separate brother and sister, the tabus that make a man run and hidefrom his step-mother, traces them to such a fundamental cause as this. Only byrespecting this primal law could the young male hope to escape the Old Man’swrath. And the Old Man must have been an actor in many a primordial nightmare. Adisposition to propitiate him even after he was dead is quite understandable.One was not sure that he was dead. He might only be asleep or shamming. Longafter an Old Man was dead, when there was nothing to represent him but a moundand a megalith, the women would convey to their children how awful and wonderfulhe was. And being still a terror to his own little tribe, it was easy to go onto hoping that he would be a terror to other and hostile people. In his life hehad fought for his tribe, even if he had bullied it. Why not when he was dead?One sees that the Old Man idea was an idea very natural to the primitive mindand capable of great development. And opposed to the Old Man, more human andkindlier, was the Mother, who helped and sheltered and advised. Thepsycho-analysis of Freud and Jung has done much to help us to realize how greata part Father fear and Mother love still play in the adaptation of the humanmind to social needs. They have made an exhaustive study of childish andyouthful dreams and imaginations, a study which has done much to help in theimaginative reconstruction of the soul of primitive man. It was, as it were, thesoul of a powerful child. He saw the universe in terms of the family herd. Hisfear of, his abjection before, the Old Man mingled with his fear of thedangerous animals about him. But the women goddesses were kindlier and moresubtle. They helped, they protected, they gratified and consoled. Yet at thesame time there was something about them less comprehensible than the directbrutality of the Old Man, a greater mystery. So that the Woman also had hervestiture of fear for him.§ 3Another idea probably arose early out of the mysterious visitation of infectiousdiseases, and that was the idea of uncleanness and of being accurst. From that,too, there may have come an idea of avoiding particular places and persons, andpersons in particular phases of health. Here was the root of another set oftabus. Then man, from the very dawn of his mental life, may have had a feelingof the sinister about places and things. Animals who dread traps, have thatfeeling. A tiger will abandon its usual jungle route at the sight of a fewthreads of cotton.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en28] Like most younganimals, young human beings are easily made fearful of this or that by theirnurses and seniors. Here is another set of ideas, ideas of repulsion andavoidance, that sprang up almost inevitably in men.As soon as speech began to develop, it must have got to work upon suchfundamental feelings and begun to systematize them, and keep them in mind. Bytalking together men would reinforce each other’s fears, and establish a commontradition of tabus of things forbidden and of things unclean. With the idea ofuncleanness would come ideas of cleansing and of removing a curse. The cleansingwould be conducted through the advice and with the aid of wise old men or wiseold women, and in such cleansing would lie the germ of the earliest priestcraftand witchcraft.Speech from the first would be a powerful supplement to the merely imitativeeducation and to the education of cuffs and blows conducted by a speechlessparent. Mothers would tell their young and scold their young. As speechdeveloped, men would find they had experiences and persuasions that gave them orseemed to give them power. They would make secrets of these things. There is adouble streak in the human mind, a streak of cunning secretiveness and a streakperhaps of later origin that makes us all anxious to tell and astonish andimpress each other. Many people make secrets in order to have secrets to tell.These secrets of early men they would convey to younger, more impressionablepeople, more or less honestly and impressively in some process of initiation.Moreover, the pedagogic spirit overflows in the human mind; most people like“telling other people not to.” Extensive arbitrary prohibitions for the boys,for the girls, for the women, also probably came very early into human history.Then the idea of the sinister has for its correlative the idea of thepropitious, and from that to the idea of making things propitious by ceremoniesis an easy step.§ 4Out of such ideas and a jumble of kindred ones grew the first quasi-religiouselements in human life. With every development of speech it became possible tointensify and develop the tradition of tabus and restraints and ceremonies.There is not a savage or barbaric race today that is not held in a net of suchtradition. And with the coming of the primitive herdsman there would be aconsiderable broadening out of all this sort of practice. Things hithertounheeded would be found of importance in human affairs. Neolithic man wasnomadic in a different spirit from the mere daylight drift after food of theprimordial hunter. He was a herdsman upon whose mind a sense of direction andthe lie of the land had been forced. He watched his flock by night as well as byday. The sun by day and presently the stars by night helped to guide hismigrations; he began to find after many ages that the stars are steadier guidesthan the sun. He would begin to note particular stars and star groups, and todistinguish any individual thing was, for primitive man, to believe itindividualized and personal. He would begin to think of the chief stars aspersons, very shining and dignified and trustworthy persons looking at him likebright eyes in the night. His primitive tillage strengthened his sense of theseasons. Particular stars ruled his heavens when seedtime was due. Up to acertain point, a mountain peak or what not, a bright star moved, night afternight. It stopped there, and then night after night receded. Surely this was asign, a silent, marvellous warning to the wise. The beginnings of agriculture,we must remember, were in the sub-tropical zone, or even nearer the equator,where stars of the first magnitude shine with a splendour unknown in moretemperate latitudes. A Carved Statue (“Menhir”) of the Neolithic Period-a Contrast to the Freedom andVigour of Palæolithic Art.051 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_051_r1.gif]And Neolithic man was counting, and falling under the spell of numbers. Thereare savage languages that have no word for any number above five. Some peoplescannot go above two. But Neolithic man in the lands of his origin in Asia andAfrica even more than in Europe was already counting his accumulatingpossessions. He was beginning to use tallies, and wondering at the triangularityof three and the squareness of four, and why some quantities like twelve wereeasy to divide in all sorts of ways, and others, like thirteen, impossible.Twelve became a noble, generous, and familiar number to him, and thirteen ratheran outcast and disreputable one.Probably man began reckoning time by the clock of the full and new moons.Moonlight is an important thing to herdsmen who no longer merely hunt theirherds, but watch and guard them. Moonlight, too, was, perhaps, his time forlovemaking, as indeed it may have been for primordial man and the ground apeancestor before him. But from the phases of the moon, as his tillage increased,man’s attitude would go on to the greater cycle of the seasons. Primordial manprobably only drifted before the winter as the days grew cold. Neolithic manknew surely that the winter would come, and stored his fodder and presently hisgrain. He had to fix a seedtime, a propitious seedtime, or his sowing was afailure. The earliest recorded reckoning is by moons and by generations of men.The former seems to be the case in the book of Genesis, where, if one reads thegreat ages of the patriarchs who lived before the flood as lunar months insteadof years, Methusaleh and the others are reduced to a credible length of life.But with agriculture began the difficult task of squaring the lunar month withthe solar year; a task which has left its scars on our calendar today. Eastershifts uneasily from year to year, to the great discomfort of holiday-makers; itis now inconveniently early and now late in the season because of this ancientreference of time to the moon.And when men began to move with set intention from place to place with theiranimal and other possessions, then they would begin to develop the idea of otherplaces in which they were not, and to think of what might be in those otherplaces. And in any valley where they lingered for a time, they would,remembering how they got there, ask, “How did this or that other thing gethere?” They would begin to wonder what was beyond the mountains, and where thesun went when it set, and what was above the clouds.§ 5The capacity for telling things increased with their vocabulary. The simpleindividual fancies, the unsystematic fetish tricks and fundamental tabus ofPalæolithic man began to be handed on and made into a more consistent system.Men began to tell stories about themselves, about the tribe, about its tabus andwhy they had to be, about the world and the why for the world. A tribal mindcame into existence, a tradition. Palæolithic man was certainly more of a freeindividualist, more of an artist, as well as more of a savage than Neolithicman. Neolithic man was coming under prescription; he could be trained from hisyouth and told to do things and not to do things; he was not so free to formindependent ideas of his own about things. He had thoughts given to him; he wasunder a new power of suggestion. And to have more words and to attend more towords is not simply to increase mental power; words themselves are powerfulthings and dangerous things. Palæolithic man’s words, perhaps, were chiefly justnames. He used them for what they were. But Neolithic man was thinking aboutthese words, he was thinking about a number of things with a great deal ofverbal confusion, and getting to some odd conclusions. In speech he had woven anet to bind his race together, but also it was a net about his feet. Man wasbinding himself into new and larger and more efficient combinations indeed, butat a price. One of the most notable things about the Neolithic Age is the totalabsence of that free, direct artistic impulse which was the supreme quality oflater Palæolithic man. We find much industry, much skill, polished implements,pottery with conventional designs, cooperation upon all sorts of things, but noevidence of personal creativeness.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en29]Self-suppression is beginning for men. Man has entered upon the long andtortuous and difficult path towards a life for the common good, with all itssacrifice of personal impulse, which he is still treading today.Certain things appear in the mythology of mankind again and again. Neolithic manwas enormously impressed by serpents—and he no longer took the sun for granted.Nearly everywhere that Neolithic culture went, there went a disposition toassociate the sun and the serpent in decoration and worship. This primitiveserpent worship spread ultimately far beyond the regions where the snake is ofserious practical importance in human life.§ 6With the beginnings of agriculture a fresh set of ideas arose in men’s minds. Wehave already indicated how easily and naturally men may have come to associatethe idea of sowing with a burial. Sir J. G. Frazer has pursued the developmentof this association in the human mind, linking up with it the conception ofspecial sacrificial persons who are killed at seedtime, the conception of aspecially purified class of people to kill these sacrifices, the first priests,and the conception of a sacrament, a ceremonial feast in which the tribe eatsportions of the body of the victim in order to share in the sacrificialbenefits.Out of all these factors, out of the Old Man tradition, out of the emotions thatsurround Women for men and Men for women, out of the desire to escape infectionand uncleanness, out of the desire for power and success through magic, out ofthe sacrificial tradition of seedtime, and out of a number of like beliefs andmental experiments and misconceptions, a complex something was growing up in thelives of men which was beginning to bind them together mentally and emotionallyin a common life and action. This something we may call religion (Lat. religare,to bind).3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en30]It was not a simple orlogical something, it was a tangle of ideas about commanding beings and spirits,about gods, about all sorts of “musts” and “must-nots.” Like all other humanmatters, religion has grown. It must be clear from what has gone before thatprimitive man—much less his ancestral apes and his ancestral Mesozoicmammals—could have had no idea of God or Religion; only very slowly did hisbrain and his powers of comprehension become capable of such generalconceptions. Religion is something that has grown up with and through humanassociation, and God has been and is still being discovered by man.052 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_052_r1.gif]This book is not a theological book, and it is not for us to embark upontheological discussion; but it is a part, a necessary and central part, of thehistory of man to describe the dawn and development of his religious ideas andtheir influence upon his activities. All these factors we have noted must havecontributed to this development, and various writers have laid most stress uponone or other of them. Sir J. G. Frazer has been the leading student of thederivation of sacraments from magic sacrifices. Grant Allen, following HerbertSpencer, in his Evolution of the Idea of God, laid stress chiefly on theposthumous worship of the Old Man. Sir E. B. Tylor (Primitive Culture) gave hisattention mainly to the disposition of primitive man to ascribe a soul to everyobject animate and inanimate. Mr. A. E. Crawley, in The Tree of Life, has calledattention to other centres of impulse and emotion, and particularly to sex as asource of deep excitement. The thing we have to bear in mind is that Neolithicman was still mentally undeveloped, he could be confused and illogical to adegree quite impossible to an educated modern person. Conflicting andcontradictory ideas could lie in his mind without challenging one another; nowone thing ruled his thoughts intensely and vividly and now another; his fears,his acts, were still disconnected as children’s are.Confusedly under the stimulus of the need and possibility of cooperation and acombined life, Neolithic mankind was feeling out for guidance and knowledge. Menwere becoming aware that personally they needed protection and direction,cleansing from impurity, power beyond their own strength. Confusedly in responseto that demand, bold men, wise men, shrewd and cunning men were arising tobecome magicians, priests, chiefs, and kings. They are not to be thought of ascheats or usurpers of power, nor the rest of mankind as their dupes. All men aremixed in their motives; a hundred things move men to seek ascendancy over othermen, but not all such motives are base or bad. The magicians usually believedmore or less in their own magic, the priests in their ceremonies, the chiefs intheir right. The history of mankind henceforth is a history of more or lessblind endeavours to conceive a common purpose in relation to which all men maylive happily, and to create and develop a common consciousness and a commonstock of knowledge which may serve and illuminate that purpose. In a vastvariety of forms this appearance of kings and priests and magic men washappening all over the world under Neolithic conditions. Everywhere mankind wasseeking where knowledge and mastery and magic power might reside; everywhereindividual men were willing, honestly or dishonestly, to rule, to direct, or tobe the magic beings who would reconcile the confusions of the community. Anotherqueer development of the later Palæolithic and Neolithic ages was thedevelopment of self-mutilation. Men began to cut themselves about, to excisenoses, ears, fingers, teeth and the like, and to attach all sorts ofsuperstitious ideas to these acts. Many children today pass through a similarphase in their mental development. There is a phase in the life of most littlegirls when they are not to be left alone with a pair of scissors for fear thatthey will cut off their hair. No animal does anything of this sort.

No doubt the reindeer hunter was a ruthless hunter and acombative and passionate creature, but he killed for reasons we can stillunderstand; Neolithic man, under the sway of talk and a confused thoughtprocess, killed on theory, he killed for monstrous and now incredible ideas, hekilled those he loved through fear and under direction. Those Neolithic men notonly made human sacrifices at seedtime; there is every reason to suppose theysacrificed wives and slaves at the burial of their chieftains; they killed men,women, and children whenever they were under adversity and thought the gods wereathirst. They practised infanticide. All these things passed on into the BronzeAge.Hitherto a social consciousness had been asleep and not even dreaming in humanhistory. Before it awakened it produced nightmares.Away beyond the dawn of history, 3,000 or 4,000 years ago, one thinks of theWiltshire uplands in the twilight of a midsummer day’s morning. The torches palein the growing light. One has a dim apprehension of a procession through theavenue of stone, of priests, perhaps fantastically dressed with skins and hornsand horrible painted masks—not the robed and bearded dignitaries our artistsrepresent the Druids to have been—of chiefs in skins adorned with necklaces ofteeth and bearing spears and axes, their great heads of hair held up with pinsof bone, of women in skins or flaxen robes, of a great peering crowd ofshock-headed men and naked children. They have assembled from many distantplaces; the ground between the avenues and Silbury Hill is dotted with theirencampments. A certain festive cheerfulness prevails. And amidst the throngmarch the appointed human victims, submissive, helpless, staring towards thedistant smoking altar at which they are to die—that the harvests may be good andthe tribe increase. . . .

IS MANKIND STILL DIFFERENTIATING? § 2. THE MAIN RACES OF MANKIND. § 3. THEBRUNET PEOPLES.§ 1IT IS NECESSARY NOW TO DISCUSS PLAINLY WHAT IS MEANT BY A PHRASE, used oftenvery carelessly, “The Races of Mankind.”It must be evident from what has already been explained in chapter 3 that man,so widely spread and subjected therefore to great differences of climate,consuming very different food in different regions, attacked by differentenemies, must always have been undergoing considerable local modification anddifferentiation. Man, like every other species of living thing, has constantlybeen tending to differentiate into several species; wherever a body of men hasbeen cut off, in islands or oceans or by deserts or mountains, from the rest ofhumanity, it must have begun very soon to develop special characteristics,specially adapted to the local conditions. But, on the other hand, man isusually a wandering and enterprising animal for whom there exist fewinsurmountable barriers. Men imitate men, fight and conquer them, interbreed,one people with another. Concurrently for thousands of years there have been twosets of forces at work, one tending to separate men into a multitude of localvarieties, and another to remix and blend these varieties together before aseparate series has been established.These two sets of forces may have fluctuated in this relative effect in thepast. Palæolithic man, for instance, may have been more of a wanderer, he mayhave drifted about over a much greater area, than later Neolithic man; he wasless fixed to any sort of home or lair, he was tied by fewer possessions. Beinga hunter, he was obliged to follow the migrations of his ordinary quarry. A fewbad seasons may have shifted him hundreds of miles. He may therefore have mixedvery widely and developed few varieties over the greater part of the world.The appearance of agriculture tended to tie those communities of mankind thattook it up to the region in which it was most conveniently carried on, and so tofavour differentiation. Mixing or differentiation is not dependent upon a higheror lower stage of civilization; many savage tribes wander now for hundreds ofmiles; many English villagers in the eighteenth century, on the other hand, hadnever been more than eight or ten miles from their villages, neither they northeir fathers nor grandfathers before them. Hunting peoples often have enormousrange. The Labrador country, for instance, is inhabited by a few thousandIndians, who follow the one great herd of caribou as it wanders yearly north andthen south again in pursuit of food. This mere handful of people covers aterritory as large as France. Nomad peoples also range very widely. Some Kalmucktribes are said to travel nearly a thousand miles between summer and winterpasture.It carries out this suggestion, that Palæolithic man ranged widely and wasdistributed thinly indeed but uniformly, throughout the world, that thePalæolithic remains we find are everywhere astonishingly uniform. To quote SirJohn Evans,The implements in distant lands are so identical in form and character with theBritish specimens that they might have been manufactured by the same hands. . .. On the banks of the Nile, many hundreds of feet above its present level,implements of the European types have been discovered; while in Somaliland, inan ancient river-valley at a great elevation above the sea, Sir H. W. Seton-Karrhas collected a large number of implements formed of flint and quartzite, which,judging from their form and character, might have been dug out of thedrift-deposits of the Somme and the Seine, the Thames or the ancient Solent.Phases of spreading and intermixture have probably alternated with phases ofsettlement and specialization in the history of mankind. But up to a few hundredyears ago it is probable that since the days of the Palæolithic Age at leastmankind has on the whole been differentiating. The species has differentiated inthat period into a very great number of varieties, many of which have reblendedwith others, which have spread and undergone further differentiation or becomeextinct. Wherever there has been a strongly marked local difference ofconditions and a check upon intermixture, there one is almost obliged to assumea variety of mankind must have appeared. Of such local varieties there must havebeen a great multitude.In one remote corner of the world, Tasmania, a little cut off population ofpeople remained in the early Palæolithic stage until the discovery of thatisland by the Dutch in 1642. They are now, unhappily, extinct. The lastTasmanian died in 1877. They may have been cut off from the rest of mankind for15,000 or 20,000 or 25,000 years.But among the numerous obstacles and interruptions to intermixture there havebeen certain main barriers, such as the Atlantic Ocean, the highlands, oncehigher, and the now vanished seas of Central Asia and the like, which have cutoff great groups of varieties from other great groups of varieties over longperiods of time. These separated groups of varieties developed very earlycertain broad resemblances and differences. Most of the varieties of men ineastern Asia and America, but not all, have now this in common, that they haveyellowish buff skins, straight black hair, and often high cheek-bones. Most ofthe native peoples of Africa south of the Sahara, but not all, have black orblackish skins, flat noses, thick lips, and frizzy hair. In north and westernEurope a great number of peoples have fair hair, blue eyes, and ruddycomplexions; and about the Mediterranean there is a prevalence of white-skinnedpeoples with dark eyes and black hair. The black hair of many of these darkwhites is straight, but never so strong and waveless as the hair of the yellowpeoples. It is straighter in the east than in the west. In southern India wefind brownish and darker peoples with straight black hair, and these as we passeastward give place to more distinctly yellow peoples. In scattered islands andin Papua and New Guinea we find another series of black and brownish peoples ofa more lowly type with frizzy hair. Heads of Australoid Types056 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_056_r1.gif]But it must be borne in mind that these are very loose-fitting generalizations.Some of the areas and isolated pockets of mankind in the Asiatic area may havebeen under conditions more like those in the European area; some of the Africanareas are of a more Asiatic and less distinctively African type. We find awavy-haired, fairish, hairy-skinned race, the Ainu, in Japan. They are more likethe Europeans in their facial type than the surrounding yellow Japanese. Theymay be a drifted patch of the whites or they may be a quite distinct people. Wefind primitive black people in the Andaman Islands far away from Australia andfar away from Africa. There is a streak of very negroid blood traceable in southPersia and some parts of India. These are the “Asiatic” negroids. There islittle or no proof that all black people, the Australians, the Asiatic negroids,and the negroes, derive from one origin, but only that they have lived for vastperiods under similar conditions. We must not assume that human beings in theeastern Asiatic area were all differentiating in one direction and all the humanbeings in Africa in another. There were great currents of tendency, it is true,but there were also backwaters, eddies, admixtures, readmixtures, and leakagesfrom one main area to the other. A coloured map of the world to show the raceswould not present just four great areas of colour; it would have to be dabbedover with a multitude of tints and intermediate shades, simple here, mixed andoverlapping there.In the early Neolithic Period in Europe—it may be 10,000 or 12,000 years ago orso—man was differentiating all over the world, and he had already differentiatedinto a number of varieties, but he has never differentiated into differentspecies. A “species,” we must remember, in biological language is distinguishedfrom a “variety” by the fact that varieties can interbreed, while species eitherdo not do so or produce offspring which, like mules, are sterile. All mankindcan interbreed freely, can learn to understand the same speech, can adapt itselfto cooperation. And in the present age, man is probably no longer undergoingdifferentiation at all. Readmixture is now a far stronger force thandifferentiation. Men mingle more and more. Mankind from the view of a biologistis an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possiblereadmixture.§ 2It is only in the last fifty or sixty years that the varieties of men came to beregarded in this light, as a tangle of differentiations recently arrested orstill in progress. Before that time students of mankind, influenced, consciouslyor unconsciously, by the story of Noah and the Ark and his three sons, Shem,Ham, and Japhet, were inclined to classify men into three or four great racesand they were disposed to regard these races as having always been separatethings, descended from originally separate ancestors. They ignored the greatpossibilities of blended races and of special local isolations and variations.The classification has varied considerably, but there has been rather too muchreadiness to assume that mankind must be completely divisible into three or fourmain groups. Ethnologists (students of race) have fallen into grievous disputesabout a multitude of minor peoples, as to whether they were of this or thatprimary race or “mixed,” or strayed early forms, or what not. But all races aremore or less mixed. There are, no doubt, four main groups, but each is amiscellany, and there are little groups that will not go into any of the fourmain divisions.Subject to these reservations, when it is clearly understood that when we speakof these main divisions we mean not simple and pure races, but groups of races,then they have a certain convenience in discussion. Over the European andMediterranean area and western Asia there are, and have been for many thousandyears, white peoples, usually called the CAUCASIANS, subdivided into two orthree subdivisions, the northern blonds or Nordic race, an alleged intermediaterace about which many authorities are doubtful, the so-called Alpine race, andthe southern dark whites, the Mediterranean or Iberian race; over eastern Asiaand America a second group of races prevails, the MONGOLIANS, generally withyellow skins, straight black hair, and sturdy bodies; over Africa the NEGROES,and in the region of Australia and New Guinea the black, primitive AUSTRALOIDS.These are convenient terms, provided the student bears in mind that they are notexactly defined terms. They represent only the common characteristics of certainmain groups of races; they leave out a number of little peoples who belongproperly to none of these divisions, and they disregard the perpetual mixingwhere the main groups overlap.§ 3The Mediterranean or Iberian division of the Caucasian race had a wider range inearly times, and was a less specialized and distinctive type than the Nordic. Itis very hard to define its southward boundaries from the Negro, or to mark offits early traces in Central Asia from those of early Mongolians. Wilfred ScawenBlunt1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en31] says that Huxley “had longsuspected a common origin of the Egyptians and the Dravidians of India, perhapsa long belt of brown-skinned men from India to Spain in very early days.”It is possible that this “belt” of Huxley’s of dark-white and brown-skinned men,this race of brunet-brown folk, ultimately spread even farther than India; thatthey reached to the shores of the Pacific, and that they were everywhere theoriginal possessors of the Neolithic culture and the beginners of what we callcivilization. It is possible that these Brunet peoples are so to speak the basicpeoples of our modern world. The Nordic and the Mongolian peoples may have beenbut northwestern and northeastern branches from this more fundamental stem. Orthe Nordic race may have been a branch, while the Mongolian, like the Negro, mayhave been another equal and distinct stem with which the brunet-browns met andmingled in South China. Or the Nordic peoples also may have developed separatelyfrom a palæolithic stage.057 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_057_r1.gif]At some period in human history (see Elliot Smith’s Migrations of Early Culture)there seems to have been a special type of Neolithic culture widely distributedin the world which had a group of features so curious and so unlikely to havebeen independently developed in different regions of the earth, as to compel usto believe that it was in effect one culture. It reached through all the regionsinhabited by the brunet Mediterranean race, and beyond through India, FurtherIndia, up the Pacific coast of China, and it spread at last across the Pacificand to Mexico and Peru. It was a coastal culture not reaching deeply inland.058 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_058_r1.gif]This peculiar development of the Neolithic culture, which Elliot Smith calledthe heliolithic2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en32] culture, includedmany or all of the following odd practices:1. circumcision,2. the very queer custom of sending the father to bed when a child is born,known as the couvade,3. the practice of massage,4. the making of mummies,5. megalithic monuments3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en33] (e.g.,Stonehenge),059 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_059_r1.gif]060 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_060_r1.gif]6. artificial deformation of the heads of the young by bandages,7. tattooing,8. religious association of the sun and the serpent, and9. the use of the symbol known as the swastika (see figure) for good-luck. Thisodd little symbol spins gaily round the world; it seems incredible that menwould have invented and made a pet of it twice over.Elliot Smith traces these associated practices in a sort of constellation allover this great Mediterranean-India Ocean-Pacific area. Where one occurs, mostof the others occur. They link Brittany with Borneo and Peru. But thisconstellation of practices does not crop up in the primitive homes of Nordic orMongolian peoples, nor does it extend southward much beyond equatorial Africa.For thousands of years, from 15000 to 1000 BC, such a heliolithic Neolithicculture and its brownish possessors may have been oozing round the world throughthe warmer regions of the world, drifting by canoes often across wide stretchesof sea. It was then the highest culture in the world; it sustained the largest,most highly developed communities. And its region of origin may have been, asElliot Smith suggests, the Mediterranean and North African region. It migratedslowly age by age. It must have been spreading up the Pacific Coast and acrossthe island steppingstones to America, long after it had passed on into otherdevelopments in its areas of origin. Many of the peoples of the East Indies,Melanesia and Polynesia were still in this heliolithic stage of development whenthey were discovered by European navigators in the eighteenth century. The firstcivilizations in Egypt and the Euphrates-Tigris valley probably developeddirectly out of this widespread culture. We will discuss later whether theChinese civilization had a different origin. The Semitic nomads of the Arabiandesert seem also to have had a heliolithic stage.061 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_061_r1.gif]062 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_062_r1.gif]063 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_063_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"064 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_064_r1.gif]CHAPTER THIRTEEN 065[bano_9781411428843_oeb_065_r1.gif]THE LANGUAGES OF MANKIND§ 1. NO ONE PRIMITIVE LANGUAGE. § 2. THE ARYAN LANGUAGES. § 3. THE SEMITICLANGUAGES. § 4. THE HAMITIC LANGUAGES. § 5. THE URAL-ALTAIC LANGUAGES. § 6. THECHINESE LANGUAGES. § 7. OTHER LANGUAGE GROUPS. § 8. A POSSIBLE PRIMITIVELANGUAGE GROUP. § 9. SOME ISOLATED LANGUAGES.§ 1IT IS IMPROBABLE THAT THERE WAS EVER SUCH A THING AS A COMMON human language. Weknow nothing of the language of Palæolithic man; we do not even know whetherPalæolithic man talked freely.We know that Palæolithic man had a keen sense of form and attitude, because ofhis drawings; and it has been suggested that he communicated his ideas verylargely by gesture. Probably such words as the earlier men used were mainlycries of alarm or passion or names for concrete things, and in many cases theywere probably imitative sounds made by or associated with the things named.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en34]The first languages were probably small collections of such words; theyconsisted of interjections and nouns. Probably the nouns were said in differentintonations to convey different meanings. If Palæolithic man had a word for“horse” or “bear,” he probably showed by tone or gesture whether he meant “bearis coming,” “bear is going,” “bear is to be hunted,” “dead bear,” “bear has beenhere,” “bear did this,” and so on. Only very slowly did the human mind developmethods of indicating action and relationship in a formal manner. Modernlanguages contain many thousands of words, but the earlier languages could haveconsisted only of a few hundred. It is said that even modern European peasantscan get along with something less than a thousand words, and it is quiteconceivable that so late as the Early Neolithic Period that was the limit of theavailable vocabulary. Probably men did not indulge in those days in conversationor description. For narrative purposes they danced and acted rather than told.They had no method of counting beyond a method of indicating two by a dualnumber, and some way of expressing many. The growth of speech was at first avery slow process indeed, and grammatical forms and the expression of abstractideas may have come very late in human history, perhaps only four hundred orfive hundred generations ago.§ 2The students of languages (philologists) tell us that they are unable to tracewith certainty any common features in all the languages of mankind. They cannoteven find any elements common to all the Caucasian languages. They find overgreat areas groups of languages which have similar root words and similar waysof expressing the same idea, but then they find in other areas languages whichappear to be dissimilar down to their fundamental structure, which expressaction and relation by entirely dissimilar devices, and have an altogetherdifferent grammatical scheme. One great group of languages, for example, nowcovers nearly all Europe and stretches out to India; it includes English,French, German, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Russian, Armenian, Persian, and variousIndian tongues. It is called the Indo-European or ARYAN family. The samefundamental roots, the same grammatical ideas, are traceable through all thisfamily. Compare, for example, English father, mother, German vater, mutter,Latin pater, mater, Greek pater, meter, French père, mère, Armenian hair, mair,Sanscrit pitar, matar, etc., etc. In a similar manner the Aryan languages ringthe changes on a great number of fundamental words, f in the Germanic languagesbecoming p in Latin, and so on. They follow a law of variation called Grimm’sLaw. These languages are not different things, they are variations of one thing.The people who use these languages think in the same way.At one time in the remote past, in the Neolithic Age, that is to say 6,000 yearsor more ago, there may have been one simple original speech from which all theseAryan languages have differentiated. Somewhere between Central Europe andWestern Asia there must have wandered a number of tribes sufficientlyintermingled to develop and use one tongue. It is convenient here to call themthe Aryan peoples. Sir H. H. Johnston has called them “Aryan Russians.” Theybelonged mostly to the Caucasian group of races and to the blond and northernsubdivision of the group, to the Nordic race that is.Here one must sound a note of warning. There was a time when the philologistswere disposed to confuse languages and races, and to suppose that people whoonce all spoke the same tongue must be all of the same blood. That, however, isnot the case, as the reader will understand if he will think of the negroes ofthe United States who now all speak English, or of the Irish, who—except forpurposes of political demonstration—no longer speak the old Erse language butEnglish, or of the Cornish people, who have lost their ancient Keltic speech.But what a common language does do, is to show that a common intercourse hasexisted, and the possibility of intermixture; and if it does not point to acommon origin, it points at least to a common future.But even this original Aryan language, which was a spoken speech perhaps 4000 or3000 BC, was by no means a primordial language or the language of a savage race.Its earliest speakers were in or past the Neolithic stage of civilization. Ithad grammatical forms and verbal devices of some complexity. The vanishedmethods of expression of the later Palæolithic peoples, of the Azilians, or ofthe early Neolithic kitchen-midden people for instance, were probably muchcruder than the most elementary form of Aryan.Probably the Aryan group of languages became distinct in a wide region of whichthe Danube, Dnieper, Don, and Volga were the main rivers, a region that extendedeastward beyond the Ural mountains north of the Caspian Sea. The area over whichthe Aryan speakers roamed probably did not for a long time reach to the Atlanticor to the south of the Black Sea beyond Asia Minor. There was no effectualseparation of Europe from Asia then at the Bosporus. The Danube flowed eastwardto a great sea that extended across the Volga region of southeastern Russiaright into Turkestan, and included the Black, Caspian, and Aral Seas of today.Perhaps it sent out arms to the Arctic Ocean. It must have been a prettyeffective barrier between the Aryan speakers and the people in northeasternAsia. South of this sea stretched a continuous shore from the Balkans toAfghanistan. Northwest of it a region of swamps and lagoons reached to theBaltic.§ 3Next to Aryan, philologists distinguish another group of languages which seem tohave been made quite separately from the Aryan languages, the Semitic. Hebrewand Arabic are kindred, but they seem to have even a different set of root wordsfrom the Aryan tongues; they express their ideas of relationship in a differentway; the fundamental ideas of their grammars are generally different. They werein all probability made by human communities quite out of touch with the Aryans,separately and independently. Hebrew, Arabic, Abyssinian, ancient Assyrian,ancient Phœnician, and a number of associated tongues are put together,therefore, as being derived from a second primary language, which is called theSEMITIC. In the very beginnings of recorded history we find Aryan-speakingpeoples and Semitic-speaking peoples carrying on the liveliest intercourse ofwar and trade round and about the eastern end of the Mediterranean, but thefundamental differences of the primary Aryan and primary Semitic languagesoblige us to believe that in early Neolithic times, before the historicalperiod, there must for thousands of years have been an almost completeseparation of the Aryan-speaking and the Semitic-speaking peoples. The latterseem to have lived either in south Arabia or in northeast Africa. In the openingcenturies of the Neolithic Age the original Aryan speakers and the originalSemitic speakers were probably living, so to speak, in different worlds with aminimum of intercourse. Racially, it would seem, they had a remote commonorigin; both Aryan speakers and Semites are classed as Caucasians; but while theoriginal Aryan speakers seem to have been of Nordic race, the original Semiteswere rather of the Mediterranean type.§ 4Philologists speak with less unanimity of a third group of languages, theHAMITIC, which some declare to be distinct from, and others allied to, theSemitic. The weight of opinion inclines now towards the idea of some primordialconnection of these two groups. The Hamitic group is certainly a much wider andmore various language group than the Semitic or the Aryan, and the Semitictongues are more of a family, have more of a common likeness, than the Aryan.The Semitic languages may have arisen as some specialized proto-Hamitic group,just as the birds arose from a special group of reptiles (Chap. IV). It is atempting speculation, but one for which there is really no basis of justifyingfact, to suppose that the rude primordial ancestor group of the Aryan tonguesbranched off from the proto-Hamitic speech forms at some still earlier date thanthe separation and specialization of Semitic. The Hamitic speakers today, likethe Semitic speakers, are mainly of the Mediterranean Caucasian race. Among theHamitic languages are the ancient Egyptian and Coptic, the Berber languages (ofthe mountain people of North Africa, the Masked Tuaregs, and other suchpeoples), and what are called the Ethiopic group of African languages in easternAfrica, including the speech of the Gallas and the Somalis. The general groupingof these various tongues suggests that they originated over some great area tothe west, as the primitive Semitic may have arisen to the east, of the Red Seadivide. That divide was probably much more effective in Pleistocene times; thesea extended across to the west of the Isthmus of Suez, and a great part oflower Egypt was under water. Long before the dawn of history, however, Asia andAfrica had joined at Suez, and these two language systems were in contact inthat region. And if Asia and Africa were separated then at Suez, they may, onthe other hand, have been joined by way of Arabia and Abyssinia.These Hamitic languages may have radiated from a centre on the African coast ofthe Mediterranean, and they may have extended over the then existing landconnections very widely into western Europe.All these three great groups of languages, it may be noted, the Aryan, Semitic,and Hamitic have one feature in common which they do not share with any otherlanguage, and that is grammatical gender; but whether that has much weight asevidence of a remote common origin of Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic is a questionfor the philologist rather than for the general student. It does not affect theclear evidence of a very long and very ancient prehistoric separation of thespeakers of these three diverse groups of tongues.The bulk of the Semitic and Hamitic-speaking peoples are put by ethnologistswith the Aryans among the Caucasian group of races. They are “white.” TheSemitic and Nordic “races” have a much more distinctive physiognomy; they seem,like their characteristic languages, to be more marked and specialized than theHamitic-speaking peoples.§ 5Across to the northeast of the Aryan and Semitic areas there must once havespread a further distinct language system which is now represented by a group oflanguages known as the TURANIAN, or URAL-ALTAIC group. This includes the Lappishof Lapland and the Samoyed speech of Siberia, the Finnish language, Magyar,Turkish or Tartar, Manchu and Mongol; it has not as a group been so exhaustivelystudied by European philologists, and there is insufficient evidence yet whetherit does or does not include the Korean and Japanese languages. H. B. Hulbert hasissued a comparative grammar of Korean and certain of the Dravidian languages ofIndia to demonstrate the close affinity he finds between them.066 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_066_r1.gif]§ 6A fifth region of language formation was southeastern Asia, where there stillprevails a group of languages consisting of monosyllables without anyinflections, in which the tone used in uttering a word determines its meaning.This may be called the Chinese or MONOSYLLABIC group, and it includes Chinese,Burmese, Siamese, and Tibetan. The difference between any of these Chinesetongues and the more western languages is profound. In the Pekinese form ofChinese there are only about 420 primary monosyllables, and consequently each ofthese has to do duty for a great number of things, and the different meaningsare indicated either by the context or by saying the word in a distinctive tone.The relations of these words to each other are expressed by quite differentmethods from the Aryan methods; Chinese grammar is a thing different in naturefrom English grammar; it is a separate and different invention. Many writersdeclare there is no Chinese grammar at all, and that is true if we mean bygrammar anything in the European sense of inflections and concords. Consequentlyany such thing as a literal translation from Chinese into English is animpossibility. The very method of the thought is different.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en35] Their philosophy remains still largelya sealed book to the European on this account and vice versa, because of thedifferent nature of the expressions.§ 7In addition, the following other great language families are distinguished bythe philologist. All the American-Indian languages, which vary widely amongthemselves, are separable from any Old World group. Here we may lump themtogether not so much as a family as a miscellany. There is one great group oflanguages in Africa, from a little way north of the equator to its southernextremity, the BANTU, and in addition a complex of other languages across thecentre of the continent about which we will not trouble here. There are also twoprobably separate groups, the DRAVIDIAN in South India, and the MALAY-POLYNESIANstretched over Polynesia, and also now including Indian tongues.Now it seems reasonable to conclude from these fundamental differences thatabout the time when men were beginning to form rather larger communities thanthe family tribe, when they were beginning to tell each other long stories andargue and exchange ideas, human beings were distributed about the world in anumber of areas which communicated very little with each other. They wereseparated by oceans, seas, thick forests, deserts or mountains from one another.There may have been in that remote time, it may be 15,000 years ago or more,Aryan, Semitic, Hamitic, Turanian, American and Chinese-speaking tribes andfamilies, wandering over their several areas of hunting and pasture, all at verymuch the same stage of culture, and each developing its linguistic instrument inits own way. Probably each of these original tribes was not more numerousaltogether than the Indians in Hudson Bay Territory today. Systematicagriculture was barely beginning then, and until agriculture made a denserpopulation possible men may have been almost as rare as the great apes havealways been. If agriculture was becoming at all important in human life at thattime, and if population was anywhere denser, it was probably in theMediterranean region and possibly in areas now submerged.In addition to these Neolithic tribes, there must have been various still moreprimitive forest folks in Africa and in India. Central Africa, from the UpperNile, was then a vast forest, impenetrable to ordinary human life, a forest ofwhich the Congo forests of today are the last shrunken remains.Possibly the spread of men of a race higher than primitive Australoids into theEast Indies,3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en36] and the development ofthe languages of the Malay-Polynesian type came later in time than theorigination of these other language groups.The language divisions of the philologist do tally, it is manifest, in a broadsort of way with the main race classes of the ethnologist, and they carry outthe same idea of age-long separations between great divisions of mankind. In theGlacial Age, ice, or at least a climate too severe for the free spreading ofpeoples, extended from the north pole into Central Europe and across Russia andSiberia to the great tablelands of Central Asia. After the last Glacial Age,this cold north mitigated its severities very slowly, and was for long withoutany other population than the wandering hunters who spread eastward and acrossBering Strait. North and Central Europe and Asia did not become sufficientlytemperate for agriculture until quite recent times, times that is within thelimit of 12,000 or possibly even 10,000 years, and a dense forest periodintervened between the age of the hunter and the agricultural clearings.This forest period was also a very wet period. It has been called the Pluvial orLacustrine Age, the rain or pond period. It has to be remembered that theoutlines of the land of the world have changed greatly even in the last hundredcenturies. Across European Russia, from the Baltic to the Caspian Sea, as theice receded there certainly spread much water and many impassable swamps; theCaspian Sea and the Sea of Aral and parts of the Desert of Turkestan, are thevestiges of a great extent of sea that reached far up to the Volga valley andsent an arm westward to join the Black Sea. Mountain barriers much higher thanthey are now, and the arm of the sea that is now the region of the Indus,completed the separation of the early Nordic races from the Mongolians and theDravidians, and made the broad racial differentiation of those groups possible.Again the blown-sand Desert of Sahara—it is not a dried-up sea, but a winddesert, and was once fertile and rich in life—becoming more and more dry andsandy, cut the Caucasians off from the sparse primitive Negro population in thecentral forest region of Africa.The Persian Gulf extended very far to the north of its present head, andcombined with the Syrian desert to cut off the Semitic peoples from the easternareas, while on the other hand the south of Arabia, much more fertile than it istoday, may have reached across what is now the Gulf of Aden towards Abyssiniaand Somaliland. The Mediterranean and Red Sea may even have been fertile valleyscontaining a string of freshwater lakes during the Pluvial Age. The Himalayasand the higher and vaster massif of Central Asia and the northward extension ofthe Bay of Bengal up to the present Ganges valley divided off the Dravidiansfrom the Mongolians, the canoe was the chief link between Dravidian and SouthernMongol, and the Gobi system of seas and lakes which presently became the Gobidesert, and the great system of mountain chains which follow one another acrossAsia from the centre to the northeast, split the Mongolian races into theChinese and the Ural-Altaic language groups.Bering Strait, when this came into existence, before or after the PluvialPeriod, isolated the Amerindians.We are not suggesting here, be it noted, that these ancient separations wereabsolute separations, but that they were effectual enough at least to preventany great intermixture of blood or any great intermixture of speech in thosedays of man’s social beginnings. There was, nevertheless, some amount of meetingand exchange even then, some drift of knowledge that spread the crude patternsand use of various implements, and the seeds of a primitive agriculture aboutthe world.§.8.067 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_067_r1.gif]The fundamental tongues of these nine main language groups we have noted werenot by any means all the human speech beginnings of the Neolithic Age. They arethe latest languages, the survivors, which have ousted their more primitivepredecessors. There may have been other, and possibly many other, ineffectivecentres of speech which were afterwards overrun by the speakers of stillsurviving tongues, and of elementary languages which faded out. We find strangelittle patches of speech still in the world which do not seem to be connectedwith any other language about them. Sometimes, however, an exhaustive inquiryseems to affiliate these disconnected patches, seems to open out to ustantalizing glimpses of some simpler, wider, and more fundamental and universalform of human speech. One language group that has been keenly discussed is theBasque group of dialects. The Basques live now on the north and south slopes ofthe Pyrenees; they number perhaps six hundred thousand altogether in Europe, andto this day they are a very sturdy and independent-spirited people. Theirlanguage, as it exists today, is a fully developed one. But it is developed uponlines absolutely different from those of the Aryan languages about it. Basquenewspapers have been published in the Argentine and in the United States tosupply groups of prosperous emigrants. The earliest “French” settlers in Canadawere Basque, and Basque names are frequent among the French Canadians to thisday. Ancient remains point to a much wider distribution of the Basque speech andpeople over Spain. For a long time this Basque language was a profoundperplexity to scholars, and its structural character led to the suggestion thatit might be related to some Amerindian tongue. A. H. Keane, in Man, Past andPresent, assembles reasons for linking it—though remotely—with the Berberlanguage of North Africa, and through the Berber with the general body ofHamitic languages, but this relationship is questioned by other philologists.They find Basque more akin to certain similarly stranded vestiges of speechfound in the Caucasian Mountains, and they are disposed to regard it as a lastsurviving member, much changed and specialized, of a once very widely extendedgroup of pre-Hamitic languages, otherwise extinct, spoken chiefly by peoples ofthat brunet Mediterranean race which once occupied most of western and southernEurope and western Asia, and which may have been very closely related to theDravidians of India and the peoples with a heliolithic culture who spreadeastward, thence through the East Indies to Polynesia and beyond.It is quite possible that over western and southern Europe language groupsextended eight or ten thousand years ago that have completely vanished beforeAryan tongues. Later on we shall note, in passing, the possibility of three lostlanguage groups represented by1. Ancient Cretan, Lydian, and the like (though these may have belonged, saysSir H. H. Johnston, to the “Basque—Caucasian—Dravidian [!] group”),2. Sumerian, and3. Elamite. The suggestion has been made—it is a mere guess—that ancientSumerian may have been a linking language between the early Basque-Caucasian andearly Mongolian groups. If this is true, then we have in this“Basque-Caucasian-Dravidian-Sumerian-proto-Mongolian” group a still more ancientand more ancestral system of speech than the fundamental Hamitic. We havesomething more like the linguistic “missing link,” more like an ancestrallanguage than anything else we can imagine at the present time. It may have beenrelated to the Aryan and Semitic and Hamitic languages much as the primitivelizards of later Palæozoic times were related to the mammals, birds, anddinosaurs respectively.§ 9The Hottentot language is said to have affinities with the Hamitic tongues, fromwhich it is separated by the whole breadth of Bantu-speaking Central Africa. AHottentot-like language with Bushman affinities is still spoken in equatorialEast Africa, and this strengthens the idea that the whole of East Africa wasonce Hamitic-speaking. The Bantu languages and peoples spread, in comparativelyrecent times, from some centre of origin in West Central Africa and cut off theHottentots from the other Hamitic peoples. But it is at least equally probablethat the Hottentot is a separate language group.Among other remote and isolated little patches of language are the Papuan speechof New Guinea and the native Australian. The now extinct Tasmanian language isbut little known. What we do know of it is in support of what we have guessedabout the comparative speechlessness of Palæolithic man.We may quote a passage from Hutchinson’s Living Races of Mankind upon thismatter:The language of the natives is irretrievably lost, only imperfect indications ofits structure and a small proportion of its words having been preserved. In theabsence of sibilants and some other features, their dialects resembled theAustralian, but were of ruder, of less developed structure, and so imperfectthat, according to Joseph Milligan, our best authority on the subject, theyobserved no settled order or arrangement of words in the construction of theirsentences, but conveyed in a supplementary fashion by tone, manner, and gesturethose modifications of meaning which we express by mood, tense, number, etc.Abstract terms were rare; for every variety of gum tree or wattle tree there wasa name, but no word for “tree” in general, nor for qualities such as hard, soft,warm, cold, long, short, round, etc. Anything hard was “like a stone,” anythinground “like the moon,” and so on, usually suiting the action to the word andconfirming by some sign the meaning to be understood."},{"pageContent":"068 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_068_r1.gif]CHAPTER FOURTEEN 069[bano_9781411428843_oeb_069_r1.gif]THE FIRST CIVILIZATIONS§ 1.

THE EARLY HISTORY OF EGYPT. § 4. THEEARLY CIVILIZATION OF INDIA. § 5. THE EARLY HISTORY OF CHINA. § 6. WHILE THECIVILIZATIONS WERE GROWING.§ 1IT WAS OUT OF THE SO-CALLED HELIOLITHIC CULTURE WE HAVE DESCRIBED in chapter 12that the first beginnings of anything that we can call a civilization arose. Itis still doubtful whether we are to consider Mesopotamia or Egypt the earlierscene of the two parallel beginnings of settled communities living in towns. By4000 BC, in both these regions of the earth, such communities existed, and hadbeen going on for a very considerable time. The excavations of the Americanexpedition at Nippur have unearthed evidence of a city community existing thereat least as early as 5000 BC, and probably as early as 6000 BC, an earlier datethan anything we know of in Egypt. The late Mr. Aaron Aaronson found a real wildwheat upon the slopes of Mt. Hermon, and it must be that somewhere in that partof the world its cultivation began. It may be that from the western end of theMediteranean, possibly in some region now submerged, as a centre that thecultivation of wheat spread over the entire eastern hemisphere. But cultivationis not civilization; the growing of wheat had spread from the Atlantic to thePacific coast with the distribution of the Neolithic culture by perhaps 15000 or10000 BC, before the beginnings of civilization. Civilization is something morethan the occasional seasonal growing of wheat. It is the settlement of men uponan area continuously cultivated and possessed, who live in buildingscontinuously inhabited with a common rule and a common city or citadel. For along time civilization may quite possibly have developed in Mesopotamia withoutany relations with the parallel beginnings in Egypt. The two settlements mayhave been quite independent, arising separately out of the widely diffusedHeliolithic Neolithic culture. Or they may have had a common origin in theregion of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and southern Arabia.070 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_070_r1.gif]The first condition necessary to a real settling down of Neolithic men, asdistinguished from a mere temporary settlement among abundant food, was ofcourse a trustworthy all-the-year-round supply of water, fodder for the animals,food for themselves, and building material for their homes. There had to beeverything they could need at any season, and no want that would tempt them towander further. This was a possible state of affairs, no doubt, in many Europeanand Asiatic valleys; and in many such valleys, as in the case of the Swiss lakedwellings, men settled from a very early date indeed; but nowhere, of anycountries now known to us, were these favourable conditions found upon such ascale, and nowhere did they hold good so surely year in and year out as in Egyptand in the country between the upper waters of the Euphrates and Tigris and thePersian Gulf.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en37] Here was a constantwater supply under enduring sunlight; trustworthy harvests year by year; inMesopotamia wheat yielded, says Herodotus, two hundredfold to the sower; Plinysays that it was cut twice and afterwards yielded good fodder for sheep; therewere abundant palms and many sorts of fruits; and as for building material, inEgypt there was clay and easily worked stone, and in Mesopotamia a clay thatbecomes a brick in the sunshine. In such countries men would cease to wander andsettle down almost unawares; they would multiply and discover themselvesnumerous and by their numbers safe from any casual assailant. They multiplied,producing a denser human population than the earth had ever known before; theirhouses became more substantial, wild beasts were exterminated over great areas,the security of life increased so that ordinary men went about in the towns andfields without encumbering themselves with weapons, and among themselves, atleast, they became peaceful peoples. Men took root as man had never taken rootbefore.But in the less fertile and more seasonal lands outside these favoured areas, inthe forests of Europe, the Arabian deserts, and the seasonal pastures of CentralAsia, there developed on the other hand a thinner, more active population ofpeoples, the primitive nomadic peoples. In contrast with the settled folk, theagriculturists, these nomads lived freely and dangerously. They were incomparison lean and hungry men. Their herding was still blended with hunting;they fought constantly for their pastures against hostile families. Thediscoveries in the elaboration of implements and the use of metals made by thesettled peoples spread to them and improved their weapons. They followed thesettled folk from Neolithic phase to Bronze phase. It is possible that in thecase of iron, the first users were nomadic. They became more warlike with betterarms, and more capable of rapid movements with the improvement of theirtransport. One must not think of a nomadic stage as a predecessor of a settledstage in human affairs. To begin with, man was a slow drifter, following food.Then one sort of men began to settle down, and another sort became moredistinctly nomadic. The settled sort began to rely more and more upon grain forfood; the nomad began to make a greater use of milk for food. He bred his cowsfor milk. The two ways of life specialized in opposite directions. It wasinevitable that nomad folk and the settled folk should clash, that the nomadsshould seem hard barbarians to the settled peoples, and the settled peoples softand effeminate and very good plunder to the nomad peoples. Along the fringes ofthe developing civilizations there must have been a constant raiding andbickering between hardy nomad tribes and mountain tribes and the more numerousand less warlike peoples in the towns and villages.For the most part this was a mere raiding of the borders. The settled folk hadthe weight of numbers on their side; the herdsmen might raid and loot, but theycould not stay. That sort of mutual friction might go on for many generations.But ever and again we find some leader or some tribe amidst the disorder of freeand independent nomads, powerful enough to force a sort of unity upon itskindred tribes, and then woe betide the nearest civilization. Down pour theunited nomads on the unwarlike, unarmed plains, and there ensues a war ofconquest. Instead of carrying off the booty, the conquerors settle down on theconquered land, which becomes all booty for them; the villagers and townsmen arereduced to servitude and tribute-paying, they become hewers of wood and drawersof water, and the leaders of the nomads become kings and princes, masters andaristocrats. They, too, settle down, they learn many of the arts and refinementsof the conquered, they cease to be lean and hungry, but for many generationsthey retain traces of their old nomadic habits, they hunt and indulge inopen-air sports, they drive and race chariots, they regard work, especiallyagricultural work, as the lot of an inferior race and class.This in a thousand variations has been one of the main stories in history forthe last seventy centuries or more. In the first history that we can clearlydecipher we find already in all the civilized regions a distinction between anon-working ruler class and the working mass of the population. And we find,too, that after some generations, the aristocrat, having settled down, begins torespect the arts and refinements and lawabidingness of settlement, and to losesomething of his original hardihood. He intermarries, he patches up a sort oftoleration between conqueror and conquered; he exchanges religious ideas andlearns the lessons upon which soil and climate insist. He becomes a part of thecivilization he has captured. And as he does so, events gather towards a freshinvasion by the free adventurers of the outer world.§ 2AThis alternation of settlement, conquest, refinement, fresh conquest,refinement, is particularly to be noted in the region of the Euphrates andTigris, which lay open in every direction to great areas which are not aridenough to be complete deserts, but which were not fertile enough to supportcivilized populations. Perhaps the earliest people to form real cities in thispart of the world, or indeed in any part of the world, were a people ofmysterious origin called the Sumerians. They were probably brunets of Iberian orDravidian affinities. They used a kind of writing which they scratched uponclay, and their language has been deciphered.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en38] It was a language more like theunclassified Caucasic language groups than any others that now exist. Theselanguages may be connected with Basque, and may represent what was once awidespread primitive language group extending from Spain and western Europe toeastern India, and reaching southwards to Central Africa. These people shavedtheir heads and wore simple tunic-like garments of wool. They settled first onthe lower courses of the great river and not very far from the Persian Gulf,which in those days ran up for a hundred and thirty miles3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en39] and more beyond its present head. Theyfertilized their fields by letting water run through irrigation trenches, andthey gradually became very skilful hydraulic engineers; they had cattle, asses,sheep, and goats, but no horses; their collections of mud huts grew into towns,and their religion raised up tower-like temple buildings. A very early Sumerian stone carving showing Sumerian warriors in phalanx071 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_071_r1.jpg]Clay, dried in the sun, was a very great fact in the lives of these people. Thislower country of the Euphrates-Tigris valleys had little or no stone. They builtof brick, they made pottery and earthenware images, and they drew and presentlywrote upon thin tile-like cakes of clay. They do not seem to have had paper orto have used parchment. Their books and memoranda, even their letters, werepotsherds.At Nippur they built a great tower of brick to their chief god, El-lil (Enlil),the memory of which is supposed to be preserved in the story of the Tower ofBabel. They seem to have been divided up into city states, which warred amongthemselves and maintained for many centuries their military capacity. Theirsoldiers carried long spears and shields, and fought in close formation.Sumerians conquered Sumerians. Sumeria remained unconquered by any stranger racefor a very long period of time indeed. They developed their civilization, theirwriting, and their shipping, through a period that may be twice as long as thewhole period from the Christian era to the present time.The first of all known empires was that founded by the high priest of the god ofthe Sumerian city of Erech. It reached, says an inscription at Nippur, from theLower (Persian Gulf) to the Upper (Mediterranean or Red?) Sea. Among the mudheaps of the Euphrates-Tigris valley the record of that vast period of history,that first half of the Age of Cultivation, is buried. There flourished the firsttemples and the first priestrulers that we know of among mankind.§ 2BUpon the western edge of this country appeared nomadic tribes ofSemitic-speaking peoples who traded, raided, and fought with the Sumerians formany generations. Then arose at last a great leader among these Semites, Sargon(2750 BC), who united them, and not only conquered the Sumerians, but extendedhis rule from beyond the Persian Gulf on the east to the Mediterranean on thewest. His own people were called the Akkadians and his empire is called theSumerian Akkadian empire. It endured for over two hundred years.But though the Semites conquered and gave a king to the Sumerian cities, it wasthe Sumerian civilization which prevailed over the simpler Semitic culture. Thenewcomers learnt the Sumerian writing (the “cuneiform” writing) and the Sumerianlanguage; they set up no Semitic writing of their own. The Sumerian languagebecame for these barbarians the language of knowledge and power, as Latin wasthe language of knowledge and power among the barbaric peoples of the middleages in Europe. This Sumerian learning had a very great vitality. It wasdestined to survive through a long series of conquests and changes that nowbegan in the valley of the two rivers.§ 2CAs the people of the Sumerian Akkadian empire lost their political and militaryvigour, fresh inundations of a warlike people began from the east, theElamites,4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en40] while from the west camethe Semitic Amorites, pinching the Sumerian Akkadian empire between them. TheAmorites settled in what was at first a small up-river town, named Babylon; andafter a hundred years of warfare became masters of all Mesopotamia under a greatking, Hammurabi (2100 BC), who founded the first Babylonian empire.Again came peace and security and a decline in aggressive prowess, and inanother hundred years fresh nomads from the east were invading Babylonia,bringing with them the horse and the war chariot, and setting up their own kingin Babylon. . . .§ 2DHigher up the Tigris, above the clay lands and with easy supplies of workablestone, a Semitic people, the Assyrians, while the Sumerians were stillunconquered by the Semites, were settling about a number of cities of whichAssur and Nineveh were the chief. Their peculiar physiognomy, the long nose andthick lips, was very like that of the commoner type of Polish Jew today. Theywore great beards and ringletted long hair, tall caps and long robes. They wereconstantly engaged in mutual raiding with the Hittites to the west; they wereconquered by Sargon I and became free again; a certain Tushratta, King ofMitanni, to the northwest, captured and held their capital, Nineveh, for a time;they intrigued with Egypt against Babylon and were in the pay of Egypt; theydeveloped the military art to a very high pitch, and became mighty raiders andexacters of tribute; and at last, adopting the horse and the war chariot, theysettled accounts for a time with the Hittites, and then, under Tiglath PileserI, conquered Babylon for themselves (about 1100 BC). But their hold on thelower, older, and more civilized land was not secure, and Nineveh, the stonecity, as distinguished from Babylon, the brick city, remained their capital. Formany centuries power swayed between Nineveh and Babylon, and sometimes it was anAssyrian and sometimes a Babylonian who claimed to be “king of the world.”For four centuries Assyria was restrained from expansion towards Egypt by afresh northward thrust and settlement of another group of Semitic peoples, theArameans, whose chief city was Damascus, and whose descendants are the Syriansof today. (There is, we may note, no connection whatever between the wordsAssyrian and Syrian. It is an accidental similarity). Across these Syrians theAssyrian kings fought for power and expansion south-westward. In 745 BC aroseanother Tiglath Pileser, Tiglath Pileser III, the Tiglath Pileser of the Bible.5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en41] He not only directed the transfer ofthe Israelites to Media (the “Lost Ten Tribes” whose ultimate fate has exercisedso many curious minds) but he conquered and ruled Babylon, so founding whathistorians know as the New Assyrian Empire. His son, Shalmaneser IV,6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en42] died during the siege of Samaria, andwas succeeded by a usurper, who, no doubt to flatter Babyloniansusceptibilities, took the ancient Akkadian Sumerian name of Sargon, Sargon II.He seems to have armed the Assyrian forces for the first time with iron weapons.It was probably Sargon II who actually carried out the deportation of the TenTribes.072 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_072_r1.gif]Such shiftings about of population became a very distinctive part of thepolitical methods of the Assyrian new empire. Whole nations who were difficultto control in their native country would be shifted en masse to unaccustomedregions and amidst strange neighbours, where their only hope of survival wouldlie in obedience to the supreme power.Sargon’s son, Sennacherib, led the Assyrian hosts to the borders of Egypt. ThereSennacherib’s army was smitten by a pestilence, a disaster described in thenineteenth chapter of the second book of Kings.“And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smotein the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and whenthey arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. SoSennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt atNineveh.”7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en43] Sennacherib’s grandson, Assurbanipal (called by the Greeks Sardanapalus), didsucceed in conquering and for a time holding lower Egypt.§ 2EThe Assyrian empire lasted only a hundred and fifty years after Sargon II. Freshnomadic Semites coming from the southeast, the Chaldeans, assisted by twoAryan-speaking peoples from the north, the Medes and Persians, combined againstit, and took Nineveh in 606 BC.The Chaldean Empire, with its capital at Babylon (Second Babylonian Empire),lasted under Nebuchadnezzar the Great (Nebuchadnezzar II) and his successorsuntil 539 BC, when it collapsed before the attack of Cyrus, the founder of thePersian power. . . .So the story goes on. In 330 BC, as we shall tell later in some detail, a Greekconqueror, Alexander the Great, is looking on the murdered body of the last ofthe Persian rulers.The story of the Tigris and Euphrates civilizations, of which we have given asyet only the bare outline, is a story of conquest following after conquest, andeach conquest replaces old rulers and ruling classes by new; races like theSumerian and the Elamite are swallowed up, their languages vanish, theyinterbreed and are lost, the Assyrian melts away into Chaldean and Syrian, theHittites become Aryanized and lose distinction, the Semites who swallowed up theSumerians give place to Aryan rulers, Medes and Persians appear in the place ofthe Elamites, the Aryan Persian language dominates the empire until the AryanGreek ousts it from official life. Meanwhile the plough does its work year byyear, the harvests are gathered, the builders build as they are told, thetradesmen work and acquire fresh devices; the knowledge of writing spreads,novel things, the horse and wheeled vehicles and iron, are introduced and becomepart of the permanent inheritance of mankind; the volume of trade upon sea anddesert increases, men’s ideas widen, and knowledge grows. There are set-backs,massacres, pestilence; but the story is, on the whole, one of enlargement. Forfour thousand years this new thing, civilization, which had set its root intothe soil of the two rivers, grew as a tree grows; now losing a limb, nowstripped by a storm, but always growing and resuming its growth. After fourthousand years the warriors and conquerors were still going to and fro over thisgrowing thing they did not understand, but men had now (330 BC) got iron,horses, writing and computation, money, a greater variety of foods and textiles,a wider knowledge of their world.The time that elapsed between the empire of Sargon I and the conquest of Babylonby Alexander the Great was as long, be it noted, at the least estimate, as thetime from Alexander the Great to the present day. And before the time of Sargon,men had been settled in the Sumerian land, living in towns, worshipping intemples, following an orderly Neolithic agricultural life in an organizedcommunity for at least as long again. “Eridu, Lagash, Ur, Uruk, Larsa, havealready an immemorial past when first they appear in history.”8[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en44]One of the most difficult things for both the writer and student of history isto sustain the sense of these time-intervals and prevent these ages becomingshortened by perspective in his imagination. Half the duration of humancivilization and the keys to all its chief institutions are to be found beforeSargon I. Moreover, the reader cannot too often compare the scale of the datesin these latter fuller pages of man’s history with the succession of countlessgenerations to which the time diagrams given on pages 9 and 44, bear witness.§ 3Parallel with the ancient beginnings of civilization in Sumeria, a parallelprocess was going on in Egypt. It is still a matter of discussion which was themost ancient of these two beginnings, or how far they had a common origin orderived one from the other.The story of the Nile valley from the dawn of its traceable history until thetime of Alexander the Great is not very dissimilar from that of Babylonia; butwhile Babylonia lay open on every side to invasion, Egypt was protected bydesert to the west and by desert and sea to the east, while to the south she hadonly negro peoples. Consequently her history is less broken by the invasions ofstrange races than is the history of Assyria and Babylon, and until towards theeighth century BC, when she fell under an Ethiopian dynasty, whenever aconqueror did come into her story, he came in from Asia by way of the Isthmus ofSuez.The Stone Age remains in Egypt are of very uncertain date; there are Palæolithicand then Neolithic remains. It is not certain whether the Neolithic pastoralpeople who left those remains were the direct ancestors of the later Egyptians.In many respects they differed entirely from their successors. They buried theirdead, but before they buried them they cut up the bodies and apparently ateportions of the flesh. They seem to have done this out of a feeling of reverencefor the departed; the dead were “eaten with honour” according to the phrase ofMr. Flinders Petrie. It may have been that the survivors hoped to retain therebysome vestige of the strength and virtue that had died. Traces of similar savagecustoms have been found in the long barrows that were scattered over westernEurope before the spreading of the Aryan peoples, and they have pervaded negroAfrica, where they are only dying out at the present time.073 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_073_r1.gif]074 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_074_r1.gif]About 5000 BC, or earlier, the traces of these primitive peoples cease, and thetrue Egyptians appear on the scene. The former people were hut builders and at acomparatively low stage of Neolithic culture, the latter were already acivilized Neolithic people; they used brick and wood buildings instead of theirpredecessors’ hovels, and they were working stone. Very soon they passed intothe Bronze Age. They possessed a system of picture writing almost as developedas the contemporary writing of the Sumerians, but quite different in character.Possibly there was an irruption from southern Arabia by way of Aden, of a freshpeople, who came into upper Egypt and descended slowly towards the delta of theNile. Dr. Wallis Budge writes of them as “conquerors from the East.” But theirgods and their ways, like their picture writing, were very different indeed fromthe Sumerian. One of the earliest known figures of a deity is that of ahippopotamus goddess, and so very distinctively African.The clay of the Nile is not so fine and plastic as the Sumerian clay, and theEgyptians made no use of it for writing. But they early resorted to strips ofthe papyrus reed fastened together, from whose name comes our word “paper.”The broad outline of the history of Egypt is simpler than the history ofMesopotamia. It has long been the custom to divide the rulers of Egypt into asuccession of Dynasties, and in speaking of the periods of Egyptian history itis usual to speak of the first, fourth, fourteenth, and so on, Dynasty. TheEgyptians were ultimately conquered by the Persians after their establishment inBabylon, and when finally Egypt fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, it wasDynasty XXXI that came to an end. In that long history of over 4,000 years, amuch longer period than that between the career of Alexander the Great and thepresent day, certain broad phases of development may be noted here. There was aphase known, as the “old kingdom,” which culminated in the IVth Dynasty; thisDynasty marks a period of wealth and splendour, and its monarchs were obsessedby such a passion for making monuments for themselves as no men have ever beforeor since had a chance to display and gratify. It was Cheops9[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en45] and Chephren and Mycerinus of thisIVth Dynasty who raised the vast piles of the great and the second and the thirdpyramids at Gizeh. These unmeaning sepulchral piles, of an almost incrediblevastness,10 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en46] erected in an age whenengineering science had scarcely begun, exhausted the resources of Egypt throughthree long reigns, and left her wasted as if by a war.The story of Egypt from the IVth to the XVth Dynasty is a story of conflictsbetween alternative capitals and competing religions, of separations intoseveral kingdoms and reunions. It is, so to speak, an internal history. Here wecan name only one of that long series of Pharaohs, Pepi II, who reigned ninetyyears, the longest reign in history, and left a great abundance of inscriptionsand buildings. At last there happened to Egypt what happened so frequently tothe civilizations of Mesopotamia. Egypt was conquered by nomadic Semites, whofounded a “shepherd” dynasty, the Hyksos (XVIth), which was finally expelled bynative Egyptians. This invasion probably happened while that first BabylonianEmpire which Hammurabi founded was flourishing, but the exact correspondences ofdates between early Egypt and Babylonia are still very doubtful. Only after along period of servitude did a popular uprising expel these foreigners again.After the war of liberation (circa 1600 BC) there followed a period of greatprosperity in Egypt, the New Empire. Egypt became a great and united militarystate, and pushed her expeditions at last as far as the Euphrates, and so theage-long struggle between the Egyptian and Babylonian-Assyrian power began.For a time Egypt was the ascendant power. Thothmes III11[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en47] and Amenophis III (XVIIIth Dynasty)ruled from Ethiopia to the Euphrates in the fifteenth century BC. For variousreasons these names stand out with unusual distinctness in the Egyptian record.They were great builders, and left many monuments and inscriptions. AmenophisIII founded Luxor, and added greatly to Karnak. At Tel-el-Amarna a mass ofletters has been found, the royal correspondence with Babylonian and Hittite andother monarchs, including that Tushratta who took Nineveh, throwing a flood oflight upon the political and social affairs of this particular age. Of AmenophisIV we shall have more to tell later, but of one, the most extraordinary and ableof Egyptian monarchs, Queen Hatasu, we have no space to tell. She is representedupon her monuments in masculine garb, and with a long beard as a symbol ofwisdom.Thereafter there was a brief Syrian conquest of Egypt, a series of changingdynasties, among which we may note the XIXth, which included Rameses II, a greatbuilder of temples, who reigned seventy-seven years (about 1317 to 1250 BC), andwho is supposed by some to have been the Pharaoh of Moses, and the XXIInd, whichincluded Shishak, who plundered Solomon’s temple (circa 930 BC). An Ethiopianconqueror from the Upper Nile founded the XXVth Dynasty, a foreign dynasty,which went down (670 BC) before the new Assyrian Empire created by TiglathPileser III, Sargon II, and Sennacherib, of which we have already made mention.The days of any Egyptian predominance over foreign nations were drawing to anend. For a time under Psammetichus I of the XXVIth Dynasty (664-610 BC) nativerule was restored, and Necho II recovered for a time the old Egyptianpossessions in Syria up to the Euphrates while the Medes and Chaldeans wereattacking Nineveh. From those gains Necho II was routed out again after the fallof Nineveh and the Assyrians by Nebuchadnezzar II, the great Chaldean king, theNebuchadnezzar of the Bible. The Jews, who had been the allies of Necho II, weretaken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon.When, in the sixth century BC, Chaldea fell to the Persians, Egypt followedsuit, a rebellion later made Egypt independent once more for sixty years, and in332 BC she welcomed Alexander the Great as her conqueror, to be ruled thereafterby foreigners, first by Greeks, then by Romans, then in succession by Arabs,Turks, and British, until the present day.Such briefly is the history of Egypt from its beginnings; a history first ofisolation and then of increasing entanglement with the affairs of other nations,as increasing facilities of communication drew the peoples of the world intocloser and closer interaction.§ 4The history we need to tell here of India is simpler even than this brief recordof Egypt. The Dravidian peoples in the Ganges valley developed upon parallellines to the Sumerian and Egyptian societies. But it is doubtful if they evergot to so high a stage of social development; they have left few monuments, andthey never achieved any form of writing.Somewhere about the time of Hammurabi or later, a branch of the Aryan-speakingpeople who then occupied North Persia and Afghanistan pushed down the northwestpasses into India. They conquered their way until they prevailed over all thedarker populations of North India, and spread their rule or influence over thewhole peninsula. They never achieved any unity in India; their history is ahistory of warring kings and republics.The Persian empire, in the days of its expansion after the capture of Babylon,pushed its boundaries beyond the Indus, and later Alexander the Great marched asfar as the border of the desert that separates the Punjab from the Gangesvalley. But with this bare statement we will for a time leave the history ofIndia.§ 5Meanwhile, as this triple system of White Man civilization developed in Indiaand in the lands about the meeting-places of Asia, Africa, and Europe, anotherand quite distinct civilization was developing and spreading out from the thenfertile but now dry and desolate valley of the Tarim and from the slopes of theKuen-lun mountains in two directions down the course of the Hwang-ho, and laterinto the valley of the Yang-tse-kiang. We know practically nothing as yet of thearchæology of China, we do not know anything of the Stone Age in that part ofthe world, and at present our ideas of this early civilization are derived fromthe still very imperfectly explored Chinese literature. It has evidently beenfrom the first and throughout a Mongolian civilization. Until after the time ofAlexander the Great there are few traces of any Aryan or Semitic, much less ofHamitic influence. All such influences were still in another world, separated bymountains, deserts, and wild nomadic tribes until that time. The Chinese seem tohave made their civilization spontaneously and unassisted. Some recent writerssuppose indeed a connection with ancient Sumeria. Of course both China andSumeria arose on the basis of the almost worldwide early Neolithic culture, butthe Tarim valley and the lower Euphrates are separated by such vast obstacles ofmountain and desert as to forbid the idea of any migration or interchange ofpeoples who had once settled down. Perhaps the movement from the north metanother movement of culture coming from the south.075 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_075_r1.gif]Though the civilization of China is wholly Mongolian (as we have definedMongolian), it does not follow that the northern roots are the only ones fromwhich it grew. If it grew first in the Tarim valley, then unlike all othercivilizations (including the Mexican and Peruvian) it did not grow out of theheliolithic culture. We Europeans know very little as yet of the ethnology andprehistory of southern China. There the Chinese mingle with such kindred peoplesas the Siamese and Burmese, and seem to bridge over towards the darker Dravidianpeoples and towards the Malays. It is quite clear from the Chinese records thatthere were southern as well as northern beginnings of a civilization, and thatthe Chinese civilization that comes into history 2000 years BC is the result ofa long process of conflicts, minglings and interchanges between a southern and anorthern culture of which the southern may have been the earlier and more highlydeveloped. The southern Chinese perhaps played the role towards the northernChinese that the Hamites or Sumerians played to the Aryan and Semitic peoples inthe west, or that the settled Dravidians played towards the Aryans in India.They may have been the first agriculturists and the first temple builders. Butso little is known as yet of this attractive chapter in prehistory, that wecannot dwell upon it further here.The chief foreigners mentioned in the early annals of China were a Ural-Altaicpeople on the northeast frontier, the Huns, against whom certain of the earlieremperors made war.Chinese history is still very little known to European students, and ouraccounts of the early records are particularly unsatisfactory. About 2700 to2400 BC reigned five emperors, who seem to have been almost incredibly exemplarybeings.There follows upon these first five emperors a series of dynasties, of which theaccounts become more and more exact and convincing as they become more recent.China has to tell a long history of border warfare and of graver strugglesbetween the settled and nomad peoples. To begin with, China, like Sumer and likeEgypt, was a land of city states. The government was at first a government ofnumerous kings; they became loosely feudal under an emperor, as the Egyptiansdid; and then later, as with the Egyptians, came a centralizing empire. Shang(1750 to 1125 BC) and Chow (1125 to 250 BC) are named as being the two greatdynasties of the feudal period. Bronze vessels of these earlier dynasties,beautiful, splendid, and with a distinctive style of their own, still exist, andthere can be no doubt of the existence of a high state of culture even beforethe days of Shang.It is perhaps a sense of symmetry that made the later historians of Egypt andChina talk of the earlier phases of their national history as being underdynasties comparable to the dynasties of the later empires, and of such early“Emperors” as Menes (in Egypt) or the First Five Emperors (in China). The earlydynasties exercised far less centralized powers than the later ones. Such unityas China possessed under the Shang Dynasty was a religious rather than aneffective political union. The “Son of Heaven” offered sacrifices for all theChinese. There was a common script, a common civilization, and a common enemy inthe Huns of the northwestern borders.The last of the Shang Dynasty was a cruel and foolish monarch who burnt himselfalive (1125 BC) in his palace after a decisive defeat by Wu Wang, the founder ofthe Chow Dynasty. Wu Wang seems to have been helped by allies from among thesouthwestern tribes as well as by a popular revolt.For a time China remained loosely united under the Chow emperors, as looselyunited as was Christendom under the popes in the Middle Ages; the Chow emperorshad become the traditional high priests of the land in the place of the ShangDynasty and claimed a sort of overlordship in Chinese affairs, but gradually theloose ties of usage and sentiment that held the empire together lost their holdupon men’s minds. Hunnish peoples to the north and west took on the Chinesecivilization without acquiring a sense of its unity. Feudal princes began toregard themselves as independent. Mr. Liang-Chi-Chao,12[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en48] one of the Chinese representatives atthe Paris Conference of 1919, states that between the eighth and fourthcenturies BC “there were in the Hwang-ho and Yang-tse valleys no less than fiveor six thousand small states with about a dozen powerful states dominating overthem.” The land was subjected to perpetual warfare (“Age of Confusion”). In thesixth century BC the great powers in conflict were Ts’i and Ts’in, which werenorthern Hwang-ho states, and Ch’u, which was a vigorous, aggressive power inthe Yang-tse valley. A confederation against Ch’u laid the foundation for aleague that kept the peace for a hundred years; the league subdued andincorporated Ch’u and made a general treaty of disarmament. It became thefoundation of a new pacific empire.The knowledge of iron entered China at some unknown date, but iron weapons beganto be commonly used only about 500 BC, that is to say two or three hundred yearsor more after this had become customary in Assyria, Egypt, and Europe. Iron wasprobably introduced from the north into China by the Huns.The last rulers of the Chow Dynasty were ousted by the kings of Ts’in, thelatter seized upon the sacred sacrificial bronze tripods, and so were able totake over the imperial duty of offering sacrifices to Heaven. In this manner wasthe Ts’in Dynasty established. It ruled with far more vigour and effect than anyprevious family. The reign of Shi Hwang-ti (meaning “first universal emperor”)of this dynasty is usually taken to mark the end of feudal and divided China. Heseems to have played the unifying role in the east that Alexander the Greatmight have played in the west, but he lived longer, and the unity he made (orrestored) was comparatively permanent, while the empire of Alexander the Greatfell to pieces, as we shall tell, at his death. Shi Hwang-ti, among other featsin the direction of common effort, organized the building of the Great Wall ofChina against the Huns. A civil war followed close upon his reign, and ended inthe establishment of the Han Dynasty. Under this Han Dynasty the empire grewgreatly beyond its original two river valleys, the Huns were effectivelyrestrained, and the Chinese penetrated westward until they began to learn atlast of civilized races and civilizations other than their own.By 100 BC the Chinese had heard of India, their power had spread across Tibetand into Western Turkestan, and they were trading by camel caravans with Persiaand the western world. So much for the present must suffice for our account ofChina. We shall return to the distinctive characters, of its civilization later.§ 6And in these thousands of years during which man was making his way step by stepfrom the barbarism of the heliolithic culture to civilization at these old-worldcentres, what was happening in the rest of the world? To the north of thesecentres, from the Rhine to the Pacific, the Nordic and Mongolian peoples, as wehave told, were also learning the use of metals; but while the civilizationswere settling down these men of the great plains were becoming migratory anddeveloping from a slow wandering life towards a complete seasonal nomadism. Tothe south of the civilized zone, in central and southern Africa, the negro wasmaking a slower progress, and that, it would seem, under the stimulus ofinvasion by whiter tribes from the Mediterranean regions, bringing with them insuccession cultivation and the use of metals. These white men came to the blackby two routes: across the Sahara to the west as Berbers and Tuaregs and thelike, to mix with the negro and create such quasi-white races as the Fulas; andalso by way of the Nile, where the Baganda (= Gandafolk) of Uganda, for example,may possibly be of remote white origin. The African forests were denser then,and spread eastward and northward from the Upper Nile.The islands of the East Indies, three thousand years ago, were probably stillonly inhabited here and there by stranded patches of Palæolithic Australoids,who had wandered thither in those immemorial ages when there was a nearlycomplete land bridge by way of the East Indies to Australia. The islands ofOceania were uninhabited. The spreading of the heliolithic peoples by seagoingcanoes into the islands of the Pacific came much later in the history of man, atearliest a thousand years BC. Still later did they reach Madagascar. The beautyof New Zealand also was as yet wasted upon mankind; its highest living creatureswere a great ostrich-like bird, the moa, now extinct, and the little kiwi whichhas feathers like coarse hair and the merest rudiments of wings.In North America a group of Mongoloid tribes were now cut off altogether fromthe old world. They were spreading slowly southward, hunting the innumerablebison of the plains. They had still to learn for themselves the secrets of aseparate agriculture based on maize, and in South America to tame the lama totheir service, and so build up in Mexico and Peru two civilizations roughlyparallel in their nature to that of Sumer, but different in many respects, andlater by six or seven thousand years. . . .When men reached the southern extremity of America, the Megatherium, the giantsloth, and the Glyptodon, the giant armadillo, were still living.There is a considerable imaginative appeal in the obscure story of the earlyAmerican civilizations. It was largely a separate development. Somewhen at lastthe southward drift of the Amerindians must have met and mingled with theeastward, canoe-borne drift of the heliolithic culture. But it was theheliolithic culture still at a very lowly stage and probably before the use ofmetals. It has to be noted as evidence of this canoe-borne origin of Americanculture, that elephant-headed figures are found in Central American drawings.American metallurgy may have arisen independently of the old-world use of metal,or it may have been brought by these elephant carvers. These American peoplesgot to the use of bronze and copper, but not to the use of iron; they had goldand silver; and their stonework, their pottery, weaving, and dyeing were carriedto a very high level. In all these things the American product resembles theold-world product generally, but always it has characteristics that aredistinctive. The American civilizations had picture-writing of a primitive sort,but it never developed even to the pitch of the earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics.In Yucatan only was there a kind of script, the Maya writing, but it was usedsimply for keeping a calendar. In Peru the beginnings of writing were supersededby a curious and complicated method of keeping records by means of knots tiedupon strings of various colours and shapes. It is said that even laws and orderscould be conveyed by this code. These string bundles were called quipus, butthough quipus are still to be found in collections, the art of reading them isaltogether lost. The Chinese histories, Mr. L. Y. Chen informs us, state that asimilar method of record by knots was used in China before the invention ofwriting there. The Peruvians also got to making maps and the use ofcounting-frames. “But with all this there was no means of handing on knowledgeand experience from one generation to another, nor was anything done to fix andsummarize these intellectual possessions, which are the basis of literature andscience.”13 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en49]When the Spaniards came to America, the Mexicans knew nothing of the Peruviansnor the Peruvians of the Mexicans. Intercourse there was none. Whatever linkshad ever existed were lost and forgotten. The Mexicans had never heard of thepotato which was a principal article of Peruvian diet. In 5000 BC the Sumeriansand Egyptians probably knew as little of one another. American was 6,000 yearsbehind the Old World."},{"pageContent":"076 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_076_r1.gif]CHAPTER FIFTEEN 077[bano_9781411428843_oeb_077_r1.gif]SEA PEOPLES AND TRADING PEOPLES§ 1. THE EARLIEST SHIPS AND SAILORS. § 2. THE ÆGEAN CITIES BEFORE HISTORY. § 3.THE FIRST VOYAGES OF EXPLORATION. § 4. EARLY TRADERS. § 5. EARLY TRAVELLERS.§ 1THE FIRST BOATS WERE MADE VERY EARLY INDEED IN THE NEOLITHIC stage of culture byriverside and lakeside peoples. They were no more than trees and floating wood,used to assist the imperfect natural swimming powers of men. Then came thehollowing out of the trees, and then, with the development of tools and aprimitive carpentry, the building of boats. Men in Egypt and Mesopotamia alsodeveloped a primitive type of basket-work boat, caulked with bitumen. Such wasthe “ark of bulrushes” in which Moses was hidden by his mother. A kindred sortof vessel grew up by the use of skins and hides expanded upon a wickerframework. To this day cowhide wicker boats (coracles) are used upon the westcoast of Ireland where there is plenty of cattle and a poverty of big trees.They are also still used on the Euphrates, and on the Towy in South Wales.Inflated skins may have preceded the coracle, and are still used on theEuphrates and upper Ganges. In the valleys of the great rivers, boats must earlyhave become an important means of communication; and it seems natural to supposethat it was from the mouths of the great rivers that man, already in areasonably seaworthy vessel, first ventured out upon what must have seemed tohim then the trackless and homeless sea.No doubt he ventured at first as a fisherman, having learnt the elements ofseacraft in creeks and lagoons. Men may have navigated boats upon the Levantinelake before the refilling of the Mediterranean by the Atlantic waters. The canoewas an integral part of the heliolithic culture, it drifted with the cultureupon the warm waters of the earth from the Mediterranean to (at last) America.There were not only canoes, but Sumerian boats and ships upon the Euphrates andTigris, when these rivers in 7000 BC fell by separate mouths into the PersianGulf. The Sumerian city of Eridu, which stood at the head of the Persian Gulf(from which it is now separated by a hundred and thirty miles of alluvium1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en50]), had ships upon the sea then. We alsofind evidence of a fully developed sea life six thousand years ago at theeastern end of the Mediterranean, and possibly at that time there were alreadycanoes on the seas among the islands of the nearer East Indies. There arepre-dynastic Neolithic Egyptian representations of Nile ships of a fair size,capable of carrying elephants.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en51]Very soon the seafaring men must have realized the peculiar freedom andopportunities the ship gave them. They could get away to islands; no chief norking could pursue a boat or ship with any certainty; every captain was a king.The seamen would find it easy to make nests upon islands and in strong positionson the mainland. There they could harbour, there they could carry on a certainagriculture and fishery; but their specialty and their main business was, ofcourse, the expedition across the sea. That was not usually a tradingexpedition; it was much more frequently a piratical raid. From what we know ofmankind, we are bound to conclude that the first sailors plundered when theycould, and traded when they had to.Because it developed in the comparatively warm and tranquil waters of theeastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the western horn ofthe Indian Ocean, the shipping of the ancient world retained throughout certaincharacteristics that make it differ very widely from the ocean-going sailingshipping, with its vast spread of canvas, of the last four hundred years. “TheMediterranean,” says Mr. Torr,3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en52]078 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_078_r1.gif]079 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_079_r1.gif]. . . is a sea where a vessel with sails may lie becalmed for days together,while a vessel with oars would easily be traversing the smooth waters, withcoasts and islands everywhere at hand to give her shelter in case of storm. Inthat sea, therefore, oars became the characteristic instruments of navigation,and the arrangement of oars the chief problem in shipbuilding. And so long asthe Mediterranean nations dominated Western Europe, vessels of the southern typewere built upon the northern coasts, though there generally was wind enough herefor sails and too much wave for oars. . . . The art of rowing can first bediscerned upon the Nile. Boats with oars are represented in the earliestpictorial monuments of Egypt, dating from about 2500 BC; and although some crewsare paddling with their faces towards the bow, others are rowing with theirfaces towards the stern. The paddling is certainly the older practice, for thehieroglyph chen depicts two arms grasping an oar in the attitude of paddling,and the hieroglyphs were invented in the earliest ages. And that practice mayreally have ceased before 2500 BC, despite the testimony of monuments of thatdate; for in monuments dating from about 1250 BC, crews are representedunmistakably rowing with their faces towards the stern and yet grasping theiroars in the attitude of paddling, so that even then Egyptian artistsmechanically followed the turn of the hieroglyph to which their hands wereaccustomed. In these reliefs there are twenty rowers on the boats on the Nile,and thirty on the ships on the Red Sea; but in the earliest reliefs the numbervaries considerably, and seems dependent on the amount of space at thesculptor’s disposal.The Aryan peoples came late to the sea. The earliest ships on the sea wereeither Sumerian or Hamitic; the Semitic peoples followed close upon thesepioneers. Along the eastern end of the Mediterranean, the Phœnicians, a Semiticpeople, set up a string of independent harbour towns of which Acre, Tyre, andSidon were the chief; and later they pushed their voyages westward and foundedCarthage and Utica in North Africa. Possibly Phœnician keels were already in theMediterranean by 2000 BC. Both Tyre and Sidon were originally on islands, and soeasily defensible against a land raid. But before we go on to the marineexploits of this great seagoing race, we must note a very remarkable and curiousnest of early sea people whose remains have been discovered in Crete.§ 2These early Cretans were of a race akin to the Iberians of Spain and WesternEurope and the dark whites of Asia Minor and North Africa, and their language isunknown. This race lived not only in Crete, but in Cyprus, Greece, Asia Minor,Sicily, and South Italy. It was a civilized people for long ages before the fairNordic Greeks spread southward through Macedonia. At Cnossos, in Crete, therehave been found the most astonishing ruins and remains, and Cnossos, therefore,is apt to overshadow the rest of these settlements in people’s imaginations, butit is well to bear in mind that though Cnossos was no doubt a chief city of thisÆgean civilization, these “Ægeans” had in the fullness of their time many citiesand a wide range. Possibly, all that we know of them now are but the vestiges ofthe far more extensive heliolithic Neolithic civilization which is now submergedunder the waters of the Mediterranean.At Cnossos there are Neolithic remains as old or older than any of thepre-dynastic remains of Egypt. The Bronze Age began in Crete as soon as it didin Egypt, and there have been vases found by Flinders Petrie in Egypt andreferred by him to the Ist Dynasty, which he declared to be importations fromCrete. Stone vessels have been found in Crete of forms characteristic of theIVth (pyramid-building) Dynasty, and there can be no doubt that there was avigorous trade between Crete and Egypt in the time of the XIIth Dynasty. Thiscontinued until about 1000 BC. It is clear that this island civilization arisingupon the soil of Crete is at least as old as the Egyptian, and that it wasalready launched upon the sea as early as 4000 BC.The great days of Crete were not so early as this. It was only about 2500 BCthat the island appears to have been unified under one ruler. Then began an ageof peace and prosperity unexampled in the history of the ancient world. Securefrom invasion, living in a delightful climate, trading with every civilizedcommunity in the world, the Cretans were free to develop all the arts andamenities of life. This Cnossos was not so much a town as the vast palace of theking and his people. It was not even fortified. The kings, it would seem, werecalled Minos always, as the kings of Egypt were all called Pharaoh; the king ofCnossos figures in the early legends of the Greeks as King Minos, who lived inthe Labyrinth and kept there a horrible monster, half man, half bull, theMinotaur, to feed which he levied a tribute of youths and maidens from theAthenians. Those stories are a part of Greek literature, and have always beenknown, but it is only in the last few decades that the excavations at Cnossoshave revealed how close these legends were to the reality. The Cretan labyrinthwas a building as stately, complex, and luxurious as any in the ancient world.Among other details we find water-pipes, bathrooms, and the like conveniences,such as have hitherto been regarded as the latest refinements of modern life.The pottery, the textile manufactures, the sculpture and painting of thesepeople, their gem and ivory work, their metal and inlaid work, is as admirableas any that mankind has produced. They were much given to festivals and shows,and, in particular, they were addicted to bull-fights and gymnasticentertainments. Their female costume became astonishingly “modern” in style;their women wore corsets and flounced dresses. They had a system of writingwhich has not yet been deciphered.080 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_080_r1.gif]It is the custom nowadays to make a sort of wonder of these achievements of theCretans, as though they were a people of incredible artistic ability living inthe dawn of civilization. But their great time was long past that dawn; as lateas 2000 BC. It took them many centuries to reach their best in art and skill,and their art and luxury are by no means so great a wonder if we reflect thatfor 3,000 years they were immune from invasion, that for a thousand years theywere at peace. Century after century their artizans could perfect their skill,and their men and women refine upon refinement. Wherever men of almost any racehave been comparatively safe in this fashion for such a length of time, theyhave developed much artistic beauty. Given the opportunity, all races areartistic. Greek legend has it that it was in Crete that Dædalus attempted tomake the first flying machine. Dædalus (= cunning artificer) was a sort ofpersonified summary of mechanical skill. It is curious to speculate what germ offact lies behind him and those waxen wings that, according to the legend, meltedand plunged his son Icarus in the sea.081 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_081_r1.gif]There came at last a change in the condition of the lives of these Cretans, forother peoples, the Greeks and the Phœnicians, were also coming out with powerfulfleets upon the seas. We do not know what led to the disaster nor who inflictedit; but some when about 1400 BC Cnossos was sacked and burnt, and though theCretan life struggled on there rather lamely for another four centuries, therecame at last a final blow about 1000 BC (that is to say, in the days of theAssyrian ascendancy in the East). The palace at Cnossos was destroyed, and neverrebuilt nor reinhabited. Possibly this was done by the ships of those newcomersinto the Mediterranean, the barbaric Greeks, a group of Aryan-speaking tribesfrom the north, who may have wiped out Cnossos as they wiped out the city ofTroy. The legend of Theseus tells of such a raid. He entered the Labyrinth(which may have been the Cnossos Palace) by the aid of Ariadne, the daughter ofMinos, and slew the Minotaur.The Iliad makes it clear that destruction came upon Troy because the Trojansstole Greek women. Modern writers, with modern ideas in their heads, have triedto make out that the Greeks assailed Troy in order to secure a trade route orsome such fine-spun commercial advantage. If so, the authors of the Iliad hidthe motives of their characters very skilfully. It would be about as reasonableto say that the Homeric Greeks went to war with the Trojans in order to be wellahead with a station on the Berlin to Baghdad railway. The Homeric Greeks were ahealthy barbaric Aryan people, with very poor ideas about trade and “traderoutes”; they went to war with the Trojans because they were thoroughly annoyedabout this stealing of women. It is fairly clear from the Minos legend and fromthe evidence of the Cnossos remains, that the Cretans kidnapped or stole youthsand maidens to be slaves, bullfighters, athletes, and perhaps sacrifices. Theytraded fairly with the Egyptians, but it may be they did not realize thegathering strength of the Greek barbarians; they “traded” violently with them,and so brought sword and flame upon themselves.Another great sea people were the Phœnicians. They were great seamen becausethey were great traders. Their colony of Carthage (founded before 800 BC byTyre) became at last greater than any of the older Phœnician cities, but alreadybefore 1500 BC both Sidon and Tyre had settlements upon the African coast.Carthage was comparatively inaccessible to the Assyrian and Babylonian hosts,and, profiting greatly by the long siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar II, becamethe greatest maritime power the world had hitherto seen. She claimed the WesternMediterranean as her own, and seized every ship she could catch west ofSardinia. Roman writers accuse her of great cruelties. She fought the Greeks forSicily, and later (in the second century BC) she fought the Romans. Alexanderthe Great formed plans for her conquest; but he died, as we shall tell later,before he could carry them out.§ 3At her zenith Carthage probably had the hitherto unheard-of population of amillion. This population was largely industrial, and her woven goods wereuniversally famous. As well as a coasting trade, she had a considerable landtrade with Central Africa,4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en53] and shesold negro slaves, ivory, metals, precious stones and the like, to all theMediterranean people; she worked Spanish copper mines, and her ships went outinto the Atlantic and coasted along Portugal and France northward as far as theCassiterides (the Scilly Isles, or Cornwall, in England) to get tin. About 520BC a certain Hanno made a voyage that is still one of the most notable in theworld. This Hanno, if we may trust the Periplus of Hanno, the Greek translationof his account which still survives, followed the African coast southward fromthe Straits of Gibraltar as far as the confines of Liberia. He had sixty bigships, and his main task was to found or reinforce certain Carthaginian stationsupon the Morocco coast. Then he pushed southward. He founded a settlement in theRio de Oro (on Kerne or Herne Island), and sailed on past the Senegal River. Thevoyagers passed on for seven days beyond the Gambia, and landed at last uponsome island. This they left in a panic, because, although the day was silentwith the silence of the tropical forests, at night they heard the sound offlutes, drums, and gongs, and the sky was red with the blaze of the bush fires.The coast country for the rest of the voyage was one blaze of fire, from theburning of the bush. Streams of fire ran down the hills into the sea, and atlength a blaze arose so loftily that it touched the skies. Three days furtherbrought them to an island containing a lake (?Sherbro Island). In this lake wasanother island (?Macaulay Island), and on this were wild, hairy men and women,“whom the interpreters called gorilla.” The Carthaginians, having caught some ofthe females of these “gorillas”—they were probably chimpanzees—turned back andeventually deposited the skins of their captives—who had proved impossiblyviolent guests to entertain on board ship—in the Temple of Juno.A still more wonderful Phœnician sea voyage, long doubted, but now supported bysome archæological evidence, is related by Herodotus, who declares that thePharaoh Necho of the XXVIth Dynasty commissioned some Phœnicians to attempt thecircumnavigation of Africa, and that starting from the Gulf of Suez southward,they did finally come back through the Mediterranean to the Nile delta. Theytook nearly three years to complete their voyage. Each year they landed, andsowed and harvested a crop of wheat before going on.§ 4The great trading cities of the Phœnicians are the most striking of the earlymanifestations of the peculiar and characteristic gift of the Semitic peoples tomankind, trade and exchange.5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en54] Whilethe Semitic Phœnician peoples were spreading themselves upon the seas, anotherkindred Semitic people, the Arameans, whose occupation of Damascus we havealready noted, were developing the caravan routes of the Arabian and Persiandeserts, and becoming the chief trading people of Western Asia. The Semiticpeoples, earlier civilized than the Aryan, have always shown, and still showtoday, a far greater sense of quality and quantity in marketable goods than thelatter; it is to their need of account-keeping that the development ofalphabetical writing is to be ascribed, and it is to them that most of the greatadvances in computation are due. Our modern numerals are Arabic; our arithmeticand algebra are essentially Semitic sciences.The Semitic peoples, we may point out here, are to this day counting peoplesstrong in their sense of equivalents and reparation. The moral teaching of theHebrews was saturated by such ideas. “With what measure ye mete, the same shallbe meted unto you.” Other races and peoples have imagined diverse and fitful andmarvellous gods, but it was the trading Semites who first began to think of Godas a Righteous Dealer, whose promises were kept, who failed not the humblestcreditor, and called to account every spurious act.The trade that was going on in the ancient world before the sixth or seventhcentury BC was almost entirely a barter trade. There was little or no credit orcoined money. The ordinary standard of value with the early Aryans was cattle,as it still is with the Zulus and Kaffirs today. In the Iliad, the respectivevalues of two shields are stated in head of cattle, and the Roman word formoneys, pecunia, is derived from pecus, cattle. Cattle as money had thisadvantage; it did not need to be carried from one owner to another, and if itneeded attention and food, at any rate it bred. But it was inconvenient for shipor caravan transit. Many other substances have at various times been foundconvenient as a standard; tobacco was once legal tender in the colonial days inNorth America, and in West Africa fines are paid and bargains made in bottles oftrade gin. The early Asiatic trade included metals; and weighed lumps of metal,since they were in general demand and were convenient for hoarding and storage,costing nothing for fodder and needing small houseroom, soon asserted theirsuperiority over cattle and sheep. Iron, which seems to have been first reducedfrom its ores by the Hittites, was, to begin with, a rare and much-desiredsubstance.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en55] It is stated by Aristotleto have supplied the first currency. In the collection of letters found atTel-el-Amarna, addressed to and from Amenophis III (already mentioned) and hissuccessor Amenophis IV, one from a Hittite king promises iron as an extremelyvaluable gift. Gold, then as now, was the most precious, and therefore mostportable, security. In early Egypt silver was almost as rare as gold until afterthe XVIIIth Dynasty. Later the general standard of value in the Eastern worldbecame silver, measured by weight.To begin with, metals were handed about in ingots and weighed at eachtransaction. Then they were stamped to indicate their fineness and guaranteetheir purity. The first recorded coins were minted about 600 BC in Lydia, agold-producing country in the west of Asia Minor. The first-known gold coinswere minted in Lydia by Crœsus, whose name has become a proverb for wealth; hewas conquered, as we shall tell later, by that same Cyrus the Persian who tookBabylon in 539 BC. But very probably coined money had been used in Babyloniabefore that time. The “sealed shekel,” a stamped piece of silver, came very nearto being a coin. The promise to pay so much silver or gold on “leather” (=parchment) with the seal of some established firm is probably as old or olderthan coinage. The Carthaginians used such “leather money.” We know very littleof the way in which small traffic was conducted. Common people, who in thoseancient times were in dependent positions, seem to have had no money at all;they did their business by barter. Early Egyptian paintings show this going on.7[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en56]§ 5When one realizes the absence of small money or of any conveniently portablemeans of exchange in the pre-Alexandrian world, one perceives how impossible wasprivate travel in those days.8 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en57] Thefirst “inns”—no doubt a sort of caravanserai—are commonly said to have come intoexistence in Lydia in the third or fourth century BC. That, however, is too latea date. They are certainly older than that. There is good evidence of them atleast as early as the sixth century. Æschylus twice mentions inns. His word is“all-receiver,” or “all-receiving house.”9[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en58] Private travellers must have beenfairly common in the Greek world, including its colonies, by this time. But suchprivate travel was a comparatively new thing then. The early historians Hecatæusand Herodotus travelled widely. “I suspect,” says Professor Gilbert Murray,“that this sort of travel ‘for Historie’ or ‘for discovery’ was rather a Greekinvention. Solon is supposed to have practised it; and even Lycurgus. . . .” Theearlier travellers were traders travelling in a caravan or in a shipload, andcarrying their goods and their minas and shekels of metal or gems or bales offine stuff with them, or government officials travelling with letters ofintroduction and a proper retinue. Possibly there were a few mendicants, and, insome restricted regions, religious pilgrims.That earlier world before 600 BC was one in which a lonely “stranger” was a rareand suspected and endangered being. He might suffer horrible cruelties, forthere was little law to protect such as he. Few individuals strayed therefore.One lived and died attached and tied to some patriarchal tribe, if one was anomad, or to some great household if one was civilized or to one of the bigtemple establishments which we will presently discuss. Or one was a herdedslave. One knew nothing, except for a few monstrous legends, of the rest of theworld in which one lived. We know more today, indeed, of the world of 600 BCthan any single living being knew at that time. We map it out, see it as a wholein relation to past and future. We begin to learn precisely what was going on atthe same time in Egypt and Spain and Media and India and China. We can share inimagination, not only the wonder of Hanno’s sailors, but of the men who lit thewarning beacons on the shore. We know that those “mountains flaming to the sky”were only the customary burning of the dry grass at that season of the year.Year by year, more and more rapidly, our common knowledge increases. In theyears to come men will understand still more of those lives in the past, untilperhaps they will understand them altogether."},{"pageContent":"082 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_082_r1.gif]CHAPTER SIXTEEN 083[bano_9781411428843_oeb_083_r1.gif]WRITING§ 1. PICTURE-WRITING. § 2. SYLLABLE-WRITING. § 3. ALPHABET-WRITING. § 4. THEPLACE OF WRITING IN HUMAN LIFE.§ 1IN THE FOUR PRECEDING CHAPTERS (XII TO XV) WE HAVE SKETCHED IN broad outline thedevelopment of the chief human communities from the primitive beginnings of theheliolithic culture to the great historical kingdoms and empires in the sixthcentury BC. We must now study a little more closely the general process ofsocial change, the growth of human ideas, and the elaboration of humanrelationships that was going on during these ages between 10000 BC and 500 BC.What we have done so far is to draw the map and name the chief kings andempires, to define the relations in time and space of Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt,Phœnicia, Cnossos, and the like; we come now to the real business of history,which is to get down below these outer forms to the thoughts and lives ofindividual men.By far the most important thing that was going on during those fifty or sixtycenturies of social development was the invention of writing and its gradualprogress to importance in human affairs. It was a new instrument for the humanmind, an enormous enlargement of its range of action, a new means of continuity.We have seen how in later Palæolithic and early Neolithic times the elaborationof articulate speech gave men a mental handhold for consecutive thought, and avast enlargement of their powers of cooperation. For a time this new acquirementseems to have overshadowed their earlier achievement of drawing, and possibly itchecked the use of gesture. But drawing presently reappeared again, for record,for signs, for the joy of drawing. Before real writing came picture-writing,such as is still practised by the Amerindians, the Bushmen, and savage andbarbaric people in all parts of the world. It is essentially a drawing of thingsand acts, helped out by heraldic indications of proper names, and by strokes anddots to represent days and distances and such-like quantitative ideas.Quite kindred to such picture-writing is the pictograph that one finds still inuse today in international railway time-tables upon the continent of Europe,where a little black sign of a cup indicates a stand-up buffet for lightrefreshments; a crossed knife and fork, a restaurant; a little steamboat, atransfer to a steamboat; and a postilion’s horn, a diligence. Similar signs areused in the well-known Michelin guides for automobilists in Europe, to show apost office (envelope) or a telephone (telephone receiver). The quality ofhotels is shown by an inn with one, two, three, or four gables, and so forth.Similarly, the roads of Europe are marked with wayside signs representing agate, to indicate a level crossing ahead, a sinuous bend for a dangerous curve,and the like. From such pictographic signs to the first elements of Chinesewriting is not a very long stretch.In Chinese writing there are still traceable a number of pictographs. Most arenow difficult to recognize. A mouth was originally written as a mouth-shapedhole, and is now, for convenience of brushwork, squared; a child, originally arecognizable little mannikin, is now a hasty wriggle and a cross; the sun,originally a large circle with a dot in the centre, has been converted, for thesake of convenience of combination, into a crossed oblong, which is easier tomake with a brush. By combining these pictographs, a second order of ideas isexpressed. For example, the pictograph for mouth combined with pictograph forvapour expressed “words.”1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en59]From such combinations one passes to what are called ideograms: the sign for“words” and the sign for “tongue” combine to make “speech”; the sign for “roof”and the sign for “pig” make “home”—for in the early domestic economy of Chinathe pig was as important as it used to be in Ireland. But, as we have alreadynoted earlier, the Chinese language consists of a comparatively few elementarymonosyllabic sounds, which are all used in a great variety of meanings, and theChinese soon discovered that a number of these pictographs and ideographs couldbe used also to express other ideas, not so conveniently pictured, but havingthe same sound. Characters so used are called phonograms. For example, the soundfang meant not only “boat,” but “a place,” “spinning,” “fragrant,” “inquire,”and several other meanings according to the context. But while a boat is easy todraw, most of the other meanings are undrawable. How can one draw “fragrant” or“inquire”? The Chinese, therefore, took the same sign for all these meanings of“fang,” but added to each of them another distinctive sign, the determinative,to show what sort of fang was intended. A “place” was indicated by the same signas for “boat” (fang) and the determinative sign for “earth”; “spinning” by thesign for fang and the sign for “silk”; “inquire” by the sign for fang, and thesign for “words,” and so on.One may perhaps make this development of pictographs, ideograms, and phonogramsa little clearer by taking an analogous case in English. Suppose we were makingup a sort of picture-writing in English, then it would be very natural to use asquare with a slanting line to suggest a lid, for the word and thing box. Thatwould be a pictograph. But now suppose we had a round sign for money, andsuppose we put this sign inside the box sign, that would do for “cashbox” or“treasury.” That would be an ideogram. But the word “box” is used for otherthings than boxes. There is the box shrub which gives us boxwood. It would behard to draw a recognizable box tree distinct from other trees, but it is quiteeasy to put our sign “box,” and add our sign for shrub as a determinative todetermine that it is that sort of box and not a common box that we want toexpress. And then there is “box,” the verb, meaning to fight with fists. Here,again, we need a determinative; we might add the two crossed swords, a signwhich is used very often upon maps to denote a battle. A box at a theatre needsyet another determinative, and so we go on, through a long series of phonograms. No. 1, painted on a rock on the shore of LakeSuperior, records an expedition across the lake,in which five canoes took part. The uprightstrokes in each indicate the number of the crew,and the bird represents a chief, “TheKingfisher.” The three circles (suns) under thearch (of heaven) indicate that the voyage lastedthree days, and the tortoise, a symbol of land,denotes a safe arrival. No. 2 is a petition sentto the United States Congress by a group ofIndian tribes, asking for fishing rights incer tain small lakes. The tribes are represented bytheir totems, martens, bear, manfish, and catfish, led by the crane. Lines running from theheart and eye of each animal to the heart andeye of the crane denote that they are all of onemind; and a line runs from the eye of the craneto the lakes, shown in the crude little “map” inthe lower left-hand corner.084 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_084_r1.gif]Now it is manifest that here in the Chinese writing is a very peculiar andcomplex system of sign-writing. A very great number of characters have to belearnt and the mind habituated to their use. The power it possesses to carryideas and discussion is still ungauged by western standards, but we may doubtwhether with this instrument it will ever be possible to establish such a wide,common mentality as the simpler and swifter alphabets of the westerncivilizations permit. In China it created a special reading-class, themandarins, who were also the ruling and official class. Their necessaryconcentration upon words and classical forms, rather than upon ideas andrealities, seems, in spite of her comparative peacefulness and the very highindividual intellectual quality of her people, to have greatly hampered thesocial and economic development of China. Probably it is the complexity of herspeech and writing, more than any other imaginable cause, that has made Chinatoday politically, socially, and individually a vast pool of backward peoplerather than the foremost power in the whole world.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en60]§ 2But while the Chinese mind thus made for itself an instrument which is probablytoo elaborate in structure, too laborious in use, and too inflexible in its formto meet the modern need for simple, swift, exact, and lucid communications, thegrowing civilizations of the west were working out the problem of a writtenrecord upon rather different and, on the whole, more advantageous lines. Theydid not seek to improve their script to make it swift and easy, butcircumstances conspired to make it so. The Sumerian picture writing, which hadto be done upon clay and with little styles, which made curved marks withdifficulty and inaccurately, rapidly degenerated by a conventionalized dabbingdown of wedged-shaped marks (cuneiform = wedge-shaped) into almostunrecognizable hints of the shapes intended. It helped the Sumerians greatly tolearn to write, that they had to draw so badly. They got very soon to theChinese pictographs, ideographs, and phonograms, and beyond them.Most people know a sort of puzzle called a rebus. It is a way of representingwords by pictures, not of the things the words represent, but by the pictures ofother things having a similar sound. For example, two gates and a head is arebus for Gates-head; a little streamlet (beck), a crowned monarch, and a ham,Beckingham. The Sumerian language was a language well adapted to this sort ofrepresentation. It was apparently a language of often quite vast polysyllables,made up of very distinct inalterable syllables; and many of the syllables takenseparately were the names of concrete things. So that this cuneiform writingdeveloped very readily into a syllabic way of writing, in which each signconveys a syllable just as each act in a charade conveys a syllable. Whenpresently the Semites conquered Sumeria, they adapted the syllabic system totheir own speech, and so this writing became entirely a sign-for-a-soundwriting. It was so used by the Assyrians and by the Chaldeans. But it was not aletter-writing, it was a syllable-writing. This cuneiform script prevailed forlong ages over Assyria, Babylonia, and the Near East generally; there arevestiges of it in some of the letters of our alphabet today.§ 3But, meanwhile, in Egypt and upon the Mediterranean coast yet another system ofwriting grew up. Its beginnings are probably to be found in the priestlypicture-writing (hieroglyphics) of the Egyptians, which also in the usual waybecame partly a sound-sign system. As we see it on the Egyptian monuments, thehieroglyphic writing consists of decorative but stiff and elaborate forms, butfor such purpose as letter-writing and the keeping of recipes and the like, theEgyptian priests used a much simplified and flowing form of these characters,the hieratic script. Side by side with this hieratic script rose another,probably also derivative from the hieroglyphs, a script now lost to use, whichwas taken over by various non-Egyptian peoples in the Mediterranean, thePhœnicians, Libyans, Lydians, Cretans, and Celt-Iberians, and used for businesspurposes. Possibly a few letters were borrowed from the later cuneiform. In thehands of these foreigners this writing was, so to speak, cut off from its roots;it lost all but a few traces of its early pictorial character. It ceased to bepictographic or ideographic; it became simply a pure sound-sign system, analphabet.There were a number of such alphabets in the Mediterranean differing widely fromeach other. It may be noted that the Phœnician alphabet (and perhaps others)omitted vowels. Possibly they pronounced their consonants very hard and hadrather indeterminate vowels, as is said to be still the case with tribes ofSouth Arabia. Quite probably, too, the Phœnicians used their alphabet at firstnot so much for writing as for single initial letters in their business accountsand tallies. One of these Mediterranean alphabets reached the Greeks, long afterthe time of the Iliad, who presently set to work to make it express the clearand beautiful sounds of their own highly developed Aryan speech. It consisted atfirst of consonants, and the Greeks added the vowels. They began to write forrecord, to help and fix their bardic tradition. . . .§ 4So it was by a series of very natural steps that writing grew out of the life ofman. At first and for long ages it was the interest and the secret of only a fewpeople in a special class, a mere accessory to the record of pictures. But therewere certain very manifest advantages, quite apart from the increasedexpressiveness of mood and qualification, to be gained by making writing alittle less plain than straightforward pictures, and in conventionalizing andcodifying it. One of these was that so messages might be sent understandable bythe sender and receiver, but not plain to the uninitiated. Another was that soone might put down various matters and help one’s memory and the memory of one’sfriends, without giving away too much to the common herd. Among some of theearliest Egyptian writings, for example, are medical recipes and magic formulæ.Accounts, letters, recipes, name lists, itineraries; these were the earliest ofwritten documents. Then, as the art of writing and reading spread, came that odddesire, that pathetic desire so common among human beings, to astonish somestrange and remote person by writing down something striking, some secret oneknew, some strange thought, or even one’s name, so that long after one had goneone’s way, it might strike upon the sight and mind of another reader. Even inSumeria men scratched on walls, and all that remains to us of the ancient world,its rocks, its buildings, is plastered thickly with the names and the boastingof those foremost among human advertisers, its kings. Perhaps half the earlyinscriptions in that ancient world are of this nature, if, that is, we groupwith the name-writing and boasting the epitaphs, which were probably in manycases prearranged by the deceased.For long the desire for crude self-assertion of the name-scrawling sort and thelove of secret understandings kept writing within a narrow scope; but thatother, more truly social desire in men, the desire to tell, was also at work.The profounder possibilities of writing, the possibilities of a vast extensionand definition and settlement of knowledge and tradition, only grew apparentafter long ages. But it will be interesting at this point and in this connectionto recapitulate certain elemental facts about life, upon which we laid stress inour earlier chapters, because they illuminate not only the huge value of writingin the whole field of man’s history, but also the role it is likely to play inhis future.1. Life had at first, it must be remembered, only a discontinuous repetition ofconsciousness, as the old died and the young were born.Such a creature as a reptile has in its brain a capacity for experience, butwhen the individual dies, its experience dies with it. Most of its motives arepurely instinctive, and all the mental life that it has is the result ofheredity (birth inheritance).2. But ordinary mammals have added to pure instinct tradition, a tradition ofexperience imparted by the imitated example of the mother, and in the case ofsuch mentally developed animals as dogs, cats, or apes, by a sort of muteprecept also. For example, the mother cat chastises her young for misbehaviour.So do mother apes and baboons.3. Primitive man added to his powers of transmitting experience, representativeart and speech. Pictorial and sculptured record and verbal tradition began.Verbal tradition was developed to its highest possibility by the bards. They didmuch to make language what it is to the world today.4. With the invention of writing, which developed out of pictorial record, humantradition was able to become fuller and much more exact. Verbal tradition, whichhad hitherto changed from age to age, began to be fixed. Men separated byhundreds of miles could now communicate their thoughts. An increasing number ofhuman beings began to share a common written knowledge and a common sense of apast and a future. Human thinking became a larger operation in which hundreds ofminds in different places and in different ages could react upon one another; itbecame a process constantly more continuous and sustained. . . .5. For hundreds of generations the full power of writing was not revealed to theworld, because for a long time the idea of multiplying writings by taking printsof a first copy did not become effective. The only way of multiplying writingswas by copying one copy at a time, and this made books costly and rare.Moreover, the tendency to keep things secret, to make a cult and mystery ofthem, and so to gain an advantage over the generality of men, has always beenvery strong in men’s minds. It is only nowadays that the great masses of mankindare learning to read, and reaching out towards the treasures of knowledge andthought already stored in books.Nevertheless, from the first writings onward a new sort of tradition, anenduring and immortal tradition, began in the minds of men. Life, throughmankind, grew thereafter more and more distinctly conscious of itself and itsworld. It is a thin streak of intellectual growth we trace in history, at firstin a world of tumultuous ignorance and forgetfulness; it is like a mere line oflight coming through the chink of an opening door into a darkened room; butslowly it widens, it grows. At last came a time in the history of Europe whenthe door, at the push of the printer, began to open more rapidly. Knowledgeflared up, and as it flared it ceased to be the privilege of a favouredminority. For us now that door swings wider, and the light behind growsbrighter. Misty it is still, glowing through clouds of dust and reek.The door is not half open; the light is but a light new lit. Our world today isonly in the beginning of knowledge."},{"pageContent":"085 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_085_r1.gif]CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 086[bano_9781411428843_oeb_086_r1.gif]GODS AND STARS, PRIESTS AND KINGS§ 1.

THE GOD-KINGS OF EGYPT. § 7. SHI HWANG-TI DESTROYS THEBOOKS.§ 1WHEN WE DIRECT OUR ATTENTION TO THESE NEW ACCUMULATIONS OF human beings thatwere beginning in Egypt and Mesopotamia, we find that one of the mostconspicuous and constant objects in all these cities is a temple or a group oftemples. In some cases there arises beside it in these regions a royal palace,but as often the temple towers over the palace. This presence of the temple isequally true of the Phœnician cities and of the Greek and Roman as they arise.The palace of Cnossos, with its signs of comfort and pleasure-seeking, and thekindred cities of the Ægean peoples, include religious shrines, but in Cretethere are also temples standing apart from the palatial city-households. Allover the ancient civilized world we find them; wherever primitive civilizationset its foot in Africa, Europe, or western Asia, a temple arose, and where thecivilization is most ancient, in Egypt and in Sumer, there the temple is most inevidence. When Hanno reached what he thought was the most westerly point ofAfrica, he set up a temple to Hercules. The beginnings of civilization and theappearance of temples is simultaneous in history. The two things belongtogether. The beginning of cities is the temple stage of history.In all these temples there was a shrine; dominating the shrine there wascommonly a great figure usually of some monstrous half-animal form, before whichstood an altar for sacrifices. In the Greek and Roman temples however the imagewas generally that of a divinity in human form. This figure was either regardedas the god or as the image or symbol of the god, for whose worship the templeexisted. And connected with the temple there were a number, and often aconsiderable number, of priests or priestesses, and temple servants, generallywearing a distinctive costume and forming an important part of the citypopulation. They belong to no household; they made up a new kind of household oftheir own. They were a caste and a class apart, attracting intelligent recruitsfrom the general population.The primary duty of this priesthood was concerned with the worship of and thesacrifices to the god of the temple. And these things were done, not at anytime,but at particular times and seasons. There had come into the life of man withhis herding and agriculture a sense of a difference between the parts of theyear and of a difference between day and day. Men were beginning to work—and toneed days of rest. The temple, by its festivals, kept count. The temple in theancient city was like the clock and calendar upon a writing-desk.But it was a centre of other functions. It was in the early temples that therecords and tallies of events were kept and that writing began. And there wasknowledge there. The people went to the temple not only en masse for festivals,but individually for help. The early priests were also doctors and magicians. Inthe earliest temples we already find those little offerings for some private andparticular end, which are still made in the chapels of Catholic churches today,ex votos, little models of hearts relieved and limbs restored, acknowledgment ofprayers answered and accepted vows.It is clear that here we have that comparatively unimportant element in the lifeof the early nomad, the medicine-man, the shrine-keeper, and the memorist,developed, with the development of the community and as a part of thedevelopment of the community from barbarism to civilized settlement, intosomething of very much greater importance. And it is equally evident that thoseprimitive fears of (and hopes of help from) strange beings, the desire topropitiate unknown forces, the primitive desire for cleansing and the primitivecraving for power and knowledge have all contributed to crystallize out this newsocial fact of the temple.The temple was accumulated by complex necessities, it grew from many roots andneeds, and the god or goddess that dominated the temple was the creation of manyimaginations and made up of all sorts of impulses, ideas, and half ideas. Herethere was a god in which one sort of ideas predominated, and there another. Itis necessary to lay some stress upon this confusion and variety of origin ingods, because there is a very abundant literature now in existence uponreligious origins, in which a number of writers insist, some on this leadingidea and some on that—we have noted several in our chapter on “Early Thought”—asthough it were the only idea. Professor Max Müller in his time, for example,harped perpetually on the idea of sun stories and sun worship. He would have hadus think that early man never had lusts or fears, cravings for power, nightmaresor fantasies, but that he meditated perpetually on the beneficent source oflight and life in the sky. Now dawn and sunset are very moving facts in thedaily life, but they are only two among many. Early men, three or four hundredgenerations ago, had brains very like our own. The fancies of our childhood andyouth are perhaps the best clue we have to the ground-stuff of early religion,and anyone who can recall those early mental experiences will understand veryeasily the vagueness, the monstrosity, and the incoherent variety of the firstgods. There were sun gods, no doubt, early in the history of temples, but therewere also hippopotamus gods and hawk gods; there were cow deities, there weremonstrous male and female gods, there were gods of terror and gods of anadorable quaintness, there were gods who were nothing but lumps of meteoricstone that had fallen amazingly out of the sky, and gods who were mere naturalstones that had chanced to have a queer and impressive shape. Some gods, likeMarduk of Babylon and the Baal (== the Lord) of the Phœnicians, Canaanites, andthe like, were quite probably at bottom just legendary wonder beings, such aslittle boys will invent for themselves today. The settled peoples, it is said,as soon as they thought of a god, invented a wife for him; most of the Egyptianand Babylonian gods were married. But the gods of the nomadic Semites had notthis marrying disposition. Children were less eagerly sought by the inhabitantsof the food-grudging steppes.Even more natural than to provide a wife for a god is to give him a house tolive in to which offerings can be brought. Of this house the knowing man, themagician, would naturally become the custodian. A certain seclusion, a certainaloofness, would add greatly to the prestige of the god. The steps by which theearly temple and the early priesthood developed so soon as an agriculturalpopulation settled and increased are all quite natural and understandable, up tothe stage of the long temple with the image, shrine and altar at one end and thelong nave in which the worshippers stood. And this temple, because it hadrecords and secrets, because it was a centre of power, advice, and instruction,because it sought and attracted imaginative and clever people for its service,naturally became a kind of brain in the growing community. The attitude of thecommon people who tilled the fields and herded the beasts towards the templewould remain simple and credulous. There, rarely seen and so imaginativelyenhanced, lived the god whose approval gave prosperity, whose anger meantmisfortune; he could be propitiated by little presents and the help of hisservants could be obtained. He was wonderful, and of such power and knowledgethat it did not do to be disrespectful to him even in one’s thoughts. Within thepriesthood, however, a certain amount of thinking went on at a rather higherlevel than that.087 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_087_r1.gif]§ 2We may note here a very interesting fact about the chief temples of Egypt and,so far as we know—because the ruins are not so distinct—of Babylonia, and thatis that they were “oriented”—that is to say, that the same sort of temple wasbuilt so that the shrine and entrance always faced in the same direction. InBabylonian temples this was most often due east, facing the sunrise on March21st and September 21st, the equinoxes; and it is to be noted that it was at thespring equinox that the Euphrates and Tigris came down in flood. The Pyramids ofGizeh are also oriented east and west, and the Sphinx faces due east, but verymany of the Egyptian temples to the south of the delta of the Nile do not pointdue east, but to the point where the sun rises at the longest day—and in Egyptthe inundation comes close to that date. Others, however, pointed nearlynorthward, and others again pointed to the rising of the star Sirius or to therising-point of other conspicuous stars. The fact of orientation links up withthe fact that there early arose a close association between various gods and thesun and various fixed stars. Whatever the mass of people outside were thinking,the priests of the temples were beginning to link the movements of thoseheavenly bodies with the power in the shrine. They were thinking about the godsthey served and thinking new meanings into them. They were brooding upon themystery of the stars. It was very natural for them to suppose that these shiningbodies, so irregularly distributed and circling so solemnly and silently, mustbe charged with portents to mankind.Among other things, this orientation of the temples served to fix and help thegreat annual festival of the New Year. On one morning in the year, and onemorning alone, in a temple oriented to the rising-place of the sun at MidsummerDay, the sun’s first rays would smite down through the gloom of the temple andthe long alley of the temple pillars, and light up the god above the altar andirradiate him with glory. The narrow, darkened structure of the ancient templesseems to be deliberately planned for such an effect. No doubt the people weregathered in the darkness before the dawn; in the darkness there was chanting andperhaps the offering of sacrifices; the god alone stood mute and invisible.Prayers and invocations would be made. Then upon the eyes of the worshippers,sensitized by the darkness, as the sun rose behind them, the god would suddenlyshine.088 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_088_r1.gif]So, at least, one explanation of orientation is found by such students oforientation as Sir Norman Lockyer.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en61]Not only is orientation apparent in most of the temples of Egypt, Assyria,Babylonia, and the east, it is found in the Greek temples; Stonehenge isoriented to the midsummer sunrise, and so are most of the megalithic circles ofEurope; the Altar of Heaven in Peking is oriented to midwinter. In the days ofthe Chinese Empire, up to a few years ago one of the most important of all theduties of the Emperor of China was to sacrifice and pray in this temple uponmidwinter’s day for a propitious year.The Egyptian priests had mapped out the stars into the constellations, anddivided up the zodiac into twelve signs by 3000 BC. . . .§ 3This clear evidence of astronomical inquiry and of a development of astronomicalideas is the most obvious, but only the most obvious evidence of the veryconsiderable intellectual activities that went on within the temple precincts inancient times. There is a curious disposition among many modern writers todeprecate priesthoods and to speak of priests as though they had always beenimpostors and tricksters, preying upon the simplicity of mankind. But, indeed,they were for long the only writing class, the only reading public, the onlylearned and the only thinkers; they were all the professional classes of thetime. You could have no intellectual life at all, you could not get access toliterature or any knowledge except through the priesthood. The temples were notonly observatories and libraries and clinics, they were museums andtreasure-houses. The original Periplus of Hanno hung in one temple in Carthage,skins of his “gorillas” were hung and treasured in another. Whatever there wasof abiding worth in the life of the community sheltered there. Herodotus, theearly Greek historian (485-425 BC), collected most of his material from thepriests of the countries in which he travelled, and it is evident they met himgenerously and put their very considerable resources completely at his disposal.Outside the temples the world was still a world of blankly illiterate andunspeculative human beings, living from day to day entirely for themselves.Moreover, there is little evidence that the commonalty felt cheated by thepriests, or had anything but trust and affection for the early priesthoods. Eventhe great conquerors of later times were anxious to keep themselves upon theright side of the priests of the nations and cities whose obedience theydesired, because of the immense popular influence of these priests.No doubt there were great differences between temple and temple and cult andcult in the spirit and quality of the priesthood. Some probably were cruel, somevicious and greedy, many dull and doctrinaire, stupid with tradition, but it hasto be kept in mind that there were distinct limits to the degeneracy orinefficiency of a priesthood. It had to keep its grip upon the general mind. Itcould not go beyond what people would stand—either towards the darkness ortowards the light. Its authority rested, in the end, on the persuasion that itsactivities were propitious.§ 4The earliest civilized governments were essentially priestly governments. It wasnot kings and captains who first set men to the plough and a settled life. Itwas the ideas of the gods and plenty, working with the acquiescence of commonmen. The early rulers of Sumer we know were all priests, kings only because theywere chief priests. And priestly government had its own weaknesses as well asits peculiar deep-rooted strength. The power of a priesthood is a power overtheir own people alone. It is a subjugation through mysterious fears and hopes.The priesthood can gather its people together for war, but its traditionalismand all its methods unfit it for military control. Against the enemy without, apriest-led people is feeble.Moreover, a priest is a man vowed, trained, and consecrated, a man belonging toa special corps, and necessarily with an intense esprit de corps. He has givenup his life to his temple and his god. This is a very excellent thing for theinternal vigour of his own priesthood, his own temple. He lives or dies for thehonour of his particular god. But in the next town or village is another templewith another god. It is his constant preoccupation to keep his people from thatgod. Religious cults and priesthoods are sectarian by nature; they will convert,they will overcome, but they will never coalesce. Our first perceptions ofevents in Sumer, in the dim uncertain light before history began, is of priestsand gods in conflict; until the Sumerians were conquered by the Semites theywere never united; and the same incurable conflict of priesthoods scars all thetemple ruins of Egypt. It was impossible that it could have been otherwise,having regard to the elements out of which religion arose.089 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_089_r1.gif]It was out of those two main weaknesses of all priesthoods, namely, theincapacity for efficient military leadership and their inevitable jealousy ofall other religious cults, that the power of secular kingship arose. The foreignenemy either prevailed and set up a king over the people, or the priesthoods whowould not give way to each other set up a common fighting captain, who retainedmore or less power in peace time. This secular king developed a group ofofficials about him and began, in relation to military organization, to take ashare in the priestly administration of the people’s affairs. So, growing out ofpriestcraft and beside the priest, the king, the protagonist of the priest,appears upon the stage of human history, and a very large amount of thesubsequent experiences of mankind is only to be understood as an elaboration,complication, and distortion of the struggle, unconscious or deliberate, betweenthese two systems of human control, the temple and the palace. And it was in theoriginal centres of civilization that this antagonism was most completelydeveloped. The barbaric Aryan peoples, who became ultimately the masters of allthe ancient civilizations of the Orient and of the western world, never passedthrough a phase of temple rule on their way to civilization; they came tocivilization late; they found that drama already half-played. They took over theideas of both temple and kingship, when those ideas were already elaboratelydeveloped, from the more civilized Hamitic or Semitic people they conquered.The greater importance of the gods and the priests in the earlier history of theMesopotamian civilization is very apparent, but gradually the palace won its wayuntil it was at last in a position to struggle definitely for the supreme power.At first, in the story, the palace is ignorant and friendless in the face of thetemple; the priests alone read, the priests alone know the people are afraid ofthem. But in the dissensions of the various cults comes the opportunity of thepalace. From other cities, from among captives, from defeated or suppressedreligious cults, the palace gets men who also can read and who can do magicthings.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en62] The court also becomes acentre of writing and record; the king thinks for himself and becomes politic.Traders and foreigners drift to the court, and if the king has not the fullrecords and the finished scholarship of the priests, he has a wider and fresherfirst-hand knowledge of many things. The priest comes into the temple when he isvery young; he passes many years as a neophyte; the path of learning the clumsyletters of primitive times is slow and toilsome; he becomes erudite andprejudiced rather than a man of the world. Some of the more active-minded youngpriests may even cast envious eyes at the king’s service. There are manycomplications and variations in this ages-long drama of the struggle going onbeneath the outward conflicts of priest and king, between the made man and theborn man, between learning and originality, between established knowledge andsettled usage on the one hand, and creative will and imagination on the other.It is not always, as we shall find later, the priest who is the conservative andunimaginative antagonist. Sometimes a king struggles against narrow andobstructive priesthoods; sometimes priesthoods uphold the standards ofcivilization against savage, egotistical, or reactionary kings.One or two outstanding facts and incidents of the early stages of thisfundamental struggle in political affairs are all that we can note here between4000 BC and the days of Alexander.§ 5In the early days of Sumeria and Akkadia the city-kings were priests andmedicine-men rather than kings, and it was only when foreign conquerors soughtto establish their hold in relation to existing institutions that thedistinction of priest and king became definite. But the god of the priestsremained as the real overlord of the land and of priest and king alike. He wasthe universal landlord; the wealth and authority of his temples andestablishments outshone those of the king. Especially was this the case withinthe city walls. Hammurabi, the founder of the first Babylonian empire, is one ofthe earlier monarchs whom we find taking a firm grip upon the affairs of thecommunity. He does it with the utmost politeness to the gods. In an inscriptionrecording his irrigation work in Sumeria and Akkadia, he begins: “When Anu andBel entrusted me with the rule of Sumer and Akkad——.” We possess a code of lawsmade by this same Hammurabi—it is the earliest known code of law—and at the headof this code we see the figure of Hammurabi receiving the law from its nominalpromulgator, the god Shamash.An act of great political importance in the conquest of any city was thecarrying off of its god to become a subordinate in the temple of its conqueror.This was far more important than the subjugation of king by king. Merodach, theBabylonian Jupiter, was carried off by the Elamites, and Babylon did not feelindependent until its return. But sometimes a conqueror was afraid of the god hehad conquered. In the collection of letters addressed to Amenophis III and IV atTel-Amarna in Egypt, to which allusion has already been made, is one from acertain king, Tushratta, King of Mitanni, who has conquered Assyria and takenthe statue of the goddess Ishtar. Apparently he has sent this statue into Egypt,partly to acknowledge the overlordship of Amenophis, but partly because he fearsher anger. (Winckler). In the Bible is related (Sam. i. v. 1) how the Ark of theCovenant of the God of the Hebrews was carried off by the Philistines, as atoken of conquest, into the temple of the fish god, Dagon, at Ashdod, and howDagon fell down and was broken, and how the people of Ashdod were smitten withdisease. In the latter story particularly, the gods and priests fill the scene;there is no king in evidence at all.Right through the history of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires no monarchseems to have felt his tenure of power secure in Babylon until he had “taken thehand of Bel”—that is to say, that he had been adopted by the priesthood of “Bel”as the god’s son and representative. As our knowledge of Assyrian and Babylonianhistory grows clearer, it becomes plainer that the politics of that world, therevolutions, usurpations, changes of dynasty, intrigues with foreign powers,turned largely upon issues between the great wealthy priesthoods and the growingbut still inadequate power of the monarchy. The king relied on his army, andthis was usually a mercenary army of foreigners, speedily mutinous if there wasno pay or plunder, and easily bribed. We have already noted the name ofSennacherib, the son of Sargon II, among the monarchs of the Assyrian empire.Sennacherib was involved in a violent quarrel with the priesthood of Babylon; henever “took the hand of Bel”; and finally struck at that power by destroyingaltogether the holy part of the city of Babylon (691 BC) and removing the statueof Bel-Marduk to Assyria. He was assassinated by one of his sons, and hissuccessor, Esar-haddon (his son, but not the son who was his assassin), found itexpedient to restore Bal-Marduk and rebuild his temple, and make his peace withthe god.Assurbanipal (Greek, Sardanapalus), the son of this Esar-haddon, is aparticularly interesting figure from this point of view of the relationship ofpriesthood and king. His father’s reconciliation with the priests of Bel-Mardukwent so far that Sardanapalus was given a Babylonian instead of a militaryAssyrian education. He became a great collector of the clay documents of thepast, and his library, which has been unearthed, is now the most precious sourceof historical material in the world. But for all his learning he kept his gripon the Assyrian army; he made a temporary conquest of Egypt, suppressed arebellion in Babylon, and carried out a number of successful expeditions. As wehave already told in chapter 14, he was almost the last of the Assyrianmonarchs. The Aryan tribes, who knew more of war than of priestcraft, andparticularly the Scythians, the Medes and Persians, had long been pressing uponAssyria from the north and northeast. The Medes and Persians formed an alliancewith the nomadic Semitic Chaldeans of the south for the joint undoing ofAssyria. Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, fell to these Aryans in 606 BC.Sixty-seven years after the taking of Nineveh by the Aryans, which leftBabylonia to the Semitic Chaldeans, the last monarch of the Chaldean Empire (theSecond Babylonian Empire), Nabonidus, the father of Belshazzar, was overthrownby Cyrus, the Persian. This Nabonidus, again, was a highly educated monarch, whobrought far too much intelligence and imagination and not enough of the shortrange wisdom of this world to affairs of state. He conducted antiquarianresearches, and to his researches it is that we owe the date of 3750 BC,assigned to Sargon I and still accepted by many authorities. He was proud ofthis determination, and left inscriptions to record it. It is clear he was areligious innovator; he built and rearranged temples and attempted to centralizereligion in Babylon by bringing a number of local gods to the temple ofBel-Marduk. No doubt he realized the weakness and disunion of his empire due tothese conflicting cults, and had some conception of unification in his mind.090 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_090_r1.gif]Events were marching too rapidly for any such development. His innovation hadmanifestly raised the suspicion and hostility of the priesthood of Bel. Theysided with the Persians. “The soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon withoutfighting.” Nabonidus was taken prisoner, and Persian sentinels were set at thegates of the temple of Bel, “where the services continued without intermission.”Cyrus did, in fact, set up the Persian Empire in Babylon with the blessing ofBel-Marduk. He gratified the conservative instincts of the priests by packingoff the local gods back to their ancestral temples. He also restored 7 the Jewsto Jerusalem.3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en63] These were merelymatters of immediate policy to him. But in bringing in the irreligious Aryans,the ancient priesthood was paying too highly for the continuation of its templeservices. It would have been wiser to have dealt with the innovations ofNabonidus, that earnest heretic, to have listened to his ideas, and to have metthe needs of a changing world. Cyrus entered Babylon 539 BC; by 521 BC. Babylonwas in insurrection again, and in 520 BC another Persian monarch, Darius, waspulling down her walls. Within two hundred years the life had altogether goneout of those venerable rituals of Bel-Marduk, and the temple of Bel-Marduk wasbeing used by builders as a quarry.§ 6The story of priest and king in Egypt is similar to, but by no means parallelwith, that of Babylonia. The kings of Sumeria and Assyria were priests who hadbecome kings; they were secularized priests. The Pharaoh of Egypt does notappear to have followed precisely that line. Already in the very oldest recordsthe Pharaoh has a power, and importance exceeding that of any priest. He is, infact, a god, and more than either priest or king. We do not know how he got tothat position. No monarch of Sumeria or Babylonia or Assyria could have inducedhis people to do for him what the great pyramid-building Pharaohs of the IVthDynasty made their people do in those vast erections. The earlier Pharaohs werenot improbably regarded as incarnations of the dominant god. The falcon godHorus sits behind the head of the great statue of Chephren. So late a monarch asRameses III (XIXth Dynasty) is represented upon his sarcophagus (now atCambridge) bearing the distinctive symbols of the three great gods of theEgyptian system. He carries the two sceptres of Osiris, the god of Day andResurrection; upon his head are the horns of the cow goddess Hathor, and alsothe sun ball and feathers of Ammon Ra. He is not merely wearing the symbols ofthese gods as a devout Babylonian might wear the symbols of Bel-Marduk; he isthese three gods in one.We find also a number of sculptures and paintings to enforce the idea that thePharaohs were the actual sons of gods. The divine fathering and birth ofAmenophis III, for instance (of the XVIIIth Dynasty), is displayed inextraordinary detail in a series of sculptures at Luxor. Moreover, it was heldthat the Pharaohs, being of so divine a strain, could not marry common clay, andconsequently they were accustomed to marry blood relations within the degrees ofconsanguinity now prohibited, even marrying their sisters.The struggle between palace and temple came into Egyptian history, therefore, ata different angle from that at which it came into Babylonia. Nevertheless, itcame in. Professor Maspero (in his New Light on Ancient Egypt) gives a veryinteresting account of the struggle of Amenophis IV with the priesthoods, andparticularly with priests of the great god, Ammon Ra, Lord of Karnak. The motherof Amenophis IV was not of the race of Pharaoh; it would seem that his father,Amenophis III, made a love match with a subject, a beautiful Syrian named Tii,and Professor Maspero finds in the possible opposition to and annoyance of thisqueen by the priests of Ammon Ra the beginnings of the quarrel. She may, hethinks, have inspired her son with a fanatical hatred of Ammon Ra. But AmenophisIV may have had a wider view. Like the Babylonian Nabonidus, who lived athousand years later, he may have had in mind the problem of moral unity in hisempire. We have already noted that Amenophis III ruled from Ethiopia to theEuphrates, and that the store of letters to himself and his son found atTel-Amarna show a very wide range of interest and influence. At any rate,Amenophis IV set himself to close all the Egyptian and Syrian temples, to put anend to all sectarian worship throughout his dominions, and to establisheverywhere the worship of one god, Aton, the solar disk. He left his capital,Thebes, which was even more the city of Ammon Ra than later Babylon was the cityof Bel-Marduk, and set up his capital at Tel-Amarna; he altered his name from“Amenophis,” which consecrated him to Ammon (Amen) to “Akhnaton,” the Sun’sGlory; and he held his own against all the priesthoods of his empire foreighteen years and died a Pharaoh. Inscription (round the edges of cover) as far asdecipherable:“Osiris, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of thetwo countries . . . son of the Sun, beloved of the gods, lordof diadems, Rameses, prince of Heliopolis, triumphant!Thou art in the condition of a god, thou shalt arise asUsr, there is no enemy to thee, I give to thee triumphamong them. . . .”BUDGE, Catalogue, Egyptian Collection, FitzwilliamMuseum, Cambridge.091 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_091_r1.gif]092 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_092_r1.gif]Opinions upon Amenophis IV, or Akhnaton, differ very widely. There are those whoregard him as the creature of his mother’s hatred of Ammon and the uxoriousspouse of a beautiful wife. Certainly he loved his wife very passionately; heshowed her great honour—Egypt honoured women, and was ruled at different timesby several queens—and he was sculptured in one instance with his wife seatedupon his knees, and in another in the act of kissing her in a chariot; but menwho live under the sway of their womenkind do not sustain great empires in theface of the bitter hostility of the most influential organized bodies in theirrealm. Others write of him as a “gloomy fanatic.” Matrimonial bliss is rare inthe cases of gloomy fanatics. It is much more reasonable to regard him as thePharaoh who refused to be a god. It is not simply his religious policy and hisfrank display of natural affection that seem to mark a strong and very originalpersonality. His æsthetic ideas were his own. He refused to have his portraitconventionalized into the customary smooth beauty of the Pharaoh god, and hisface looks out at us across an interval of thirty-four centuries, a man amidstranks of divine insipidities.A reign of eighteen years was not long enough for the revolution hecontemplated, and his son-in-law who succeeded him went back to Thebes and madehis peace with Ammon Ra.To the very end of the story the divinity of kings haunted the Egyptian mind,and infected the thoughts of intellectually healthier races. When Alexander theGreat reached Babylon, the prestige of Bel-Marduk was already far gone in decay,but in Egypt, Ammon Ra was still god enough to make a snob of the conqueringGrecian. The priests of Ammon Ra, about the time of the XVIIIth or XIXth Dynasty(circa 1400 BC), had set up in an oasis of the desert a temple and oracle. Herewas an image of the god which could speak, move its head, and accept or rejectscrolls of inquiry. This oracle was still flourishing in 332 BC. The youngmaster of the world, it is related, made a special journey to visit it; he cameinto the sanctuary, and the image advanced out of the darkness at the back tomeet him. There was an impressive exchange of salutations. Some such formula asthis must have been used (says Professor Maspero): “Come, son of my loins, wholoves me so that I give thee the royalty of Ra and the royalty of Horus! I givethee valiance, I give thee to hold all countries and all religions under thyfeet; I give thee to strike all the peoples united together with thy arm!”So it was that the priests of Egypt conquered their conqueror, and an Aryanmonarch first became a god.§ 7The struggle of priest and king in China cannot be discussed here at any length.It was different again, as in Egypt it was different from Babylonia, but we findthe same effort on the part of the ruler to break up tradition because itdivides up the people. The Chinese Emperor, the “Son of Heaven,” was himself ahigh-priest, and his chief duty was sacrificial; in the more disorderly phasesof Chinese history he ceases to rule and continues only to sacrifice. Theliterary class was detached from the priestly class at an early date. It becamea bureaucratic body serving the local kings and rulers. That is a fundamentaldifference between the history of China and any Western history. While Alexanderwas overrunning Western Asia, China, under the last priest-emperors of the ChowDynasty, was sinking into a state of great disorder. Each province clung to itsseparate nationality and traditions, and the Huns spread from province toprovince. The King of T’sin (who lived about eighty years after Alexander theGreat), impressed by the mischief tradition was doing in the land, resolved todestroy the entire Chinese literature, and his son, Shi Hwang-ti, the “firstuniversal Emperor,” made a strenuous attempt to seek out and destroy all theexisting classics. They vanished while he ruled, and he ruled without tradition,and welded China into a unity that endured for some centuries; but when he hadpassed, the hidden books crept out again. China remained united, though notunder his descendants, but after a civil war under a fresh dynasty, the HanDynasty (206 BC). The first Han monarch did not sustain this campaign of ShiHwang-ti against the literati, and his successor made his peace with them andrestored the texts of the classics."},{"pageContent":"093 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_093_r1.gif]CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 094[bano_9781411428843_oeb_094_r1.gif]SERFS, SLAVES, SOCIAL CLASSES, AND FREE INDIVIDUALS§ 1.

CASTE IN INDIA. § 7. THE SYSTEM OF THEMANDARINS. § 8. A SUMMARY OF FIVE THOUSAND YEARS.§ 1WE HAVE BEEN SKETCHING IN THE LAST FOUR CHAPTERS THE GROWTH OF civilized statesout of the primitive Neolithic agriculture that began in Mesopotamia perhaps15,000 years ago. It was at first horticulture rather than agriculture; it wasdone with the hoe before the plough, and at first it was quite supplementary tothe sheep, goat, and cattle tending that made the “living” of the family tribe.We have traced the broad outlines of the development in regions of exceptionalfruitfulness of the first settled village communities into more populous townsand cities, and the growth of the village shrine and the village medicine-maninto the city temple and the city priesthood. We have noted the beginnings oforganized war, first as a flickering between villages, and then as a moredisciplined struggle between the priest-king and god of one city and those ofanother. Our story has passed on rapidly from the first indications of conquestand empire in Sumer, 6000 or 7000 BC, to the spectacle of great empires growingup, with roads and armies, with inscriptions and written documents, witheducated priesthoods and kings and rulers sustained by a tradition alreadyancient. We have traced in broad outline the appearance and conflicts andreplacements of these empires of the great rivers. We have directed attention,in particular, to the evidence of a development of still wider political ideasas we find it betrayed by the actions and utterances of such men as Nabonidusand Amenophis IV. It has been an outline of the accumulations of humanexperience for ten or fifteen thousand years, a vast space of time in comparisonwith all subsequent history, but a brief period when we measure it against thesuccession of endless generations that intervenes between us and the first rudeflint-using human creatures of the Pleistocene dawn. But for these last fourchapters we have been writing almost entirely not about mankind generally, butonly about the men who thought, the men who could draw and read and write, themen who were altering their world. Beneath their activities what was the life ofthe mute multitude?The life of the common man was, of course, affected and changed by these things,just as the lives of the domestic animals and the face of the cultivated countrywere changed; but for the most part it was a change suffered and not a change inwhich the common man upon the land had any voice or will. Reading and writingwere not yet for the likes of him. He went on cultivating his patch, loving hiswife and children, beating his dog and tending his beasts, grumbling at hardtimes, fearing the magic of the priests and the power of the gods, desiringlittle more except to be left alone by the powers above him. So he was in 10000BC; so he was, unchanged in nature and outlook, in the time of Alexander theGreat; so over the greater part of the world he remains today. He got ratherbetter tools, better seeds, better methods, a slightly sounder house, he soldhis produce in a more organized market as civilization progressed. A certainfreedom and a certain equality passed out of human life when men ceased towander. Men paid in liberty for safety, shelter, and regular meals. Byimperceptible degrees the common man found the patch he cultivated was not hisown; it belonged to the god; and he had to pay a fraction of his produce to thegod. Or the god had given it to the king, who exacted his rent and tax. Or theking had given it to an official, who was the lord of the common man. Andsometimes the god or the king or the noble had work to be done, and then thecommon man had to leave his patch and work for his master.How far the patch he cultivated was his own was never very clear to him. Inancient Assyria the land seems to have been held as a sort of freehold and theoccupier paid taxes; in Babylonia the land was the god’s, and he permitted thecultivator to work thereon. In Egypt the temples or Pharaoh-the-god or thenobles under Pharaoh were the owners and rent receivers. But the cultivator wasnot a slave; he was a peasant, and only bound to the land in so far that therewas nothing else for him to do but cultivate, and nowhere else for him to go. Helived in a village or town, and went out to his work. The village, to beginwith, was often merely a big household of related people under a patriarchheadman, the early town a group of householders under its elders. There was noprocess of enslavement as civilization grew, but the headmen and leaderly mengrew in power and authority, and the common men did not keep pace with them, andfell into a tradition of dependence and subordination.On the whole, the common men were probably well content to live under lord orking or god and obey their bidding. It was safer. It was easier. All animals—andman is no exception—begin life as dependents. Most men never shake themselvesloose from the desire for leading and protection.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en64]§ 2095 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_095_r1.gif]The earlier wars did not involve remote or prolonged campaigns, and they werewaged by levies of the common people. But war brought in a new source ofpossessions, plunder, and a new social factor, the captive. In the earlier,simpler days of war, the captive man was kept only to be tortured or sacrificedto the victorious god; the captive women and children were assimilated into thetribe. But later many captives were spared to be slaves because they hadexceptional gifts or peculiar arts. It would be the kings and captains who wouldtake these slaves at first, and it would speedily become apparent to them thatthese men were much more their own than were the peasant cultivators and commonmen of their own race. The slave could be commanded to do all sorts of thingsfor his master that the quasi-free common man would not do so willingly becauseof his attachment to his own patch of cultivation. From a very early period theartificer was often a household slave, and the manufacture of trade goods,pottery, textiles, metal ware, and go forth, such as went on vigorously in thehousehold city of the Minos of Cnossos, was probably a slave industry from thebeginning. Sayce, in his Babylonians and Assyrians, quotes Babylonian agreementsfor the teaching of trades to slaves, and dealing with the exploitation of slaveproducts. Slaves produced slave children, enslavement in discharge of debtsadded to the slave population; it is probable that as the cities grew larger, alarger part of the new population consisted of these slave artificers and slaveservants in the large households. They were by no means abject slaves; in laterBabylon their lives and property were protected by elaborate laws. Nor were theyall outlanders. Parents might sell their children into slavery, and brotherstheir orphan sisters. Free men who had no means of livelihood would even sellthemselves into slavery. And slavery was the fate of the insolvent debtor. Craftapprenticeship, again, was a sort of fixed-term slavery. Out of the slavepopulation, by a converse process, arose the freed-man and freed-woman, whoworked for wages and had still more definite individual rights. Since in Babylonslaves could themselves own property, many slaves saved up and boughtthemselves. Probably the town slave was often better off and practically as freeas the cultivator of the soil, and as the rural population increased, its sonsand daughters came to mix with and swell the growing ranks of artificers, somebound, some free.As the extent and complexity of government increased, the number of householdsmultiplied. Under the king’s household grew up the households of his greatministers and officials, under the temple grew up the personal households oftemple functionaries; it is not difficult to realize how houses and patches ofland would become more and more distinctly the property of the occupiers, andmore and more definitely alienated from the original owner-god. The earlierempires in Egypt and China both passed into a feudal stage, in which families,originally official, became for a time independent noble families. In the laterstages of Babylonian civilization we find an increasing propertied class ofpeople appearing in the social structure, neither slaves nor peasants norpriests nor officials, but widows and descendants of such people, or successfultraders and the like, and all masterless folk. Traders came in from the outside.Babylon was full of Aramean traders, who had great establishments, with slaves,freed-men, employees of all sorts. Their book-keeping was a serious undertaking.It involved storing a great multitude of earthenware tablets in huge earthenwarejars). Upon this gathering mixture of more or less free and detached peoplewould live other people, traders, merchants, small dealers, catering for theirneeds. Sayce (op. cit.) gives the particulars of an agreement for the setting upand stocking of a tavern and beerhouse, for example. The passerby, the man whohappened to be about, had come into existence.096 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_096_r1.gif]But another and far less kindly sort of slavery also arose in the oldcivilization, and that was gang slavery. If it did not figure very largely inthe cities, it was very much in evidence elsewhere. The king was, to begin with,the chief entrepreneur. He made the canals and organized the irrigation (e.g.,Hammurabi’s enterprises noted in the previous chapter). He exploited mines. Heseems (at Cnossos e.g.,) to have organized manufactures for export. The Pharaohsof the 1st Dynasty were already working the copper and turquoise mines in thepeninsula of Sinai. For many such purposes gangs of captives were cheaper andfar more controllable than levies of the king’s own people. From an earlyperiod, too, captives may have tugged the oars of the galleys, though Torr(Ancient Ships) notes that up to the age of Pericles (450 BC) the free Athenianswere not above this task. And the monarch also found slaves convenient for hismilitary expeditions. They were uprooted men; they did not fret to go home,because they had no homes to go to. The Pharaohs hunted slaves in Nubia, inorder to have black troops for their Syrian expeditions. Closely allied to suchslave troops were the mercenary barbaric troops the monarchs caught into theirservice, not by positive compulsion, but by the bribes of food and plunder andunder the pressure of need. As the old civilization developed, these mercenaryarmies replaced the national levies of the old order more and more, and servilegang labour became a more and more important and significant factor in theeconomic system. From mines and canal and wall building, the servile gang spreadinto cultivation. Nobles and temples adopted the gang-slave system for theirworks. Plantation gangs began to oust the patch cultivation of the labourer-serfin the case of some staple products. . . .§ 3So, in a few paragraphs, we trace the development of the simple social structureof the early Sumerian cities to the complex city crowds, the multitude ofindividuals varying in race, tradition, education, and function, varying inwealth, freedom, authority, and usefulness, in the great cities of the lastthousand years BC. The most notable thing of all is the gradual increase amidstthis heterogeneous multitude of what we may call free individuals , detachedpersons who are neither priests, nor kings, nor officials, nor serfs, norslaves, who are under no great pressure to work, who have time to read andinquire. They appear side by side with the development of social security andprivate property. Coined money and monetary reckoning developed. The operationsof the Arameans and such-like Semitic trading people led to the organization ofcredit and monetary security. In the earlier days almost the only property,except a few movables, consisted of rights in land and in houses; later, onecould deposit and lend securities, could go away and return to find one’sproperty faithfully held and secure. Towards the middle of the period of thePersian Empire there lived one free individual, Herodotus, who has a greatinterest for us because he was among the first writers of critical andintelligent history, as distinguished from a mere priestly or court chronicle.It is worth while to glance here very briefly at the circumstances of his life.Later on we shall quote from his history.We have already noted the conquest of Babylonia by the Aryan Persians underCyrus in 539 BC. We have noted, further, that the Persian Empire spread intoEgypt, where its hold was precarious; and it extended also over Asia Minor.Herodotus was born about 484 BC in a Greek city of Asia Minor, Halicarnassus,which was under the overlordship of the Persians, and directly under the rule ofa political boss or tyrant. There is no sign that he was obliged either to workfor a living or spend very much time in the administration of his property. Wedo not know the particulars of his affairs, but it is clear that in this minorGreek city, under foreign rule, he was able to obtain and read and studymanuscripts of nearly everything that had been written in the Greek languagebefore his time. He travelled, so far as one can gather, with freedom andcomfort about the Greek archipelagoes; he stayed wherever he wanted to stay, andhe seems to have found comfortable accommodation; he went to Babylon and toSusa, the new capital the Persians had set up in Babylonia to the east of theTigris; he toured along the coast of the Black Sea, and accumulated aconsiderable amount of knowledge about the Scythians, the Aryan people who werethen distributed over South Russia; he went to the south of Italy, explored theantiquities of Tyre, coasted Palestine, landed at Gaza, and made a long stay inEgypt. He went about Egypt looking at temples and monuments and gatheringinformation. We know not only from him, but from other evidence, that in thosedays the older temples and the pyramids (which were already nearly threethousand years old) were visited by strings of tourists, a special sort ofpriests acting as guides. The inscriptions the sightseers scribbled upon thewalls remain to this day, and many of them have been deciphered and published.As his knowledge accumulated, he conceived the idea of writing a great historyof the attempts of Persia to subdue Greece. But in order to introduce thathistory he composed an account of the past of Greece, Persia, Assyria,Babylonia, Egypt, Scythia, and of the geography and peoples of those countries.He then set himself, it is said, to make his history known among his friends inHalicarnassus by reciting it to them, but they failed to appreciate it; and hethen betook himself to Athens, the most flourishing of all Greek cities at thattime. There his work was received with applause. We find him in the centre of abrilliant circle of intelligent and active-minded people, and the cityauthorities voted him a reward of ten talents (a sum of money equivalent to£2400) in recognition of his literary achievement. . . .But we will not complete the biography of this most interesting man, nor will weenter into any criticism of his garrulous, marvel-telling, and most entertaininghistory. It is a book to which all intelligent, readers come sooner or later,abounding as it does in illuminating errors and Boswellian charm. We give theseparticulars here simply to show that in the fifth century BC a new factor wasbecoming evident in human affairs. Reading and writing had already long escapedfrom the temple precincts and the ranks of the court scribes. Record was nolonger confined to court and temple. A new sort of people, these people ofleisure and independent means, were asking questions, exchanging knowledge andviews, and developing ideas. So beneath the march of armies and the policies ofmonarchs, and above the common lives of illiterate and incurious men, we notethe beginnings of what is becoming at last nowadays a dominant power in humanaffairs, the free intelligence of mankind. STATUETTES FROM MIDDLE CLASS EGYPTIAN TOMBS SHOWING LOW-CLASS SOCIAL TYPES INTHE ANCIENT COMMUNITIES097 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_097_r1.gif]Of that free intelligence we shall have more to say when in a subsequent chapterwe tell of the Greeks.§ 4We may summarize the discussion of the last two chapters here by making a listof the chief elements in this complicated accumulation of human beings whichmade up the later Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations of from two thousandfive hundred to three thousand years ago. These elements grew up and becamedistinct one from another in the great river valleys of the world in the courseof five or six thousand years. They developed mental dispositions and traditionsand attitudes of thought one to another. The civilization in which we live todayis simply carrying on and still further developing and working out andrearranging these relationships. This is the world from which we inherit. It isonly by the attentive study of their origins that we can detach ourselves fromthe prejudices and immediate ideas of the particular class to which we maybelong, and begin to understand the social and political questions of our owntime.1. First, then, came the priesthood, the temple system, which was the nucleusand the guiding intelligence about which the primitive civilizations grew. Itwas still in these later days a great power in the world, the chief repositoryof knowledge and tradition, an influence over the lives of everyone, and abinding force to hold the community together. But it was no longer all-powerful,because its nature made it conservative and inadaptable. It no longermonopolized knowledge nor initiated fresh ideas. Learning had already leaked outto other less pledged and controlled people, who thought for themselves. Aboutthe temple system were grouped its priests and priestesses, its scribes, itsphysicians, its magicians, its lay brethren, treasurers, managers, directors,and the like. It owned great properties and often hoarded huge treasures.2. Over against the priesthood, and originally arising out of it, was the courtsystem, headed by a king or a “king of kings,” who was in later Assyria andBabylonia a sort of captain and lay controller of affairs, and in Egypt agod-man, who had released himself from the control of his priests. About themonarch were accumulated his scribes, counsellors, record keepers, agents,captains, and guards. Many of his officials, particularly his provincialofficials, had great subordinate establishments, and were constantly tending tobecome independent. The nobility of the old river valley civilizations arose outof the court system. It was, therefore, a different thing in its origins fromthe nobility of the early Aryans, which was a republican nobility of elders andleading men.3. At the base of the social pyramid was the large and most necessary class inthe community, the tillers of the soil. Their status varied from age to age andin different lands; they were free peasants paying taxes, or serfs of the god,or serfs or tenants of king or noble, or of a private owner, paying him a rent;in most cases tax or rent was paid in produce. In the states of the rivervalleys they were high cultivators, cultivating comparatively small holdings;they lived together for safety in villages, and had a common interest inmaintaining their irrigation channels and a sense of community in their villagelife. The cultivation of the soil is an exacting occupation; the seasons and theharvest sunsets will not wait for men; children can be utilized at an early age,and so the cultivator class is generally a poorly educated, close-toiling class,superstitious by reason of ignorance and the uncertainty of the seasons,ill-informed and easily put upon. It is capable at times of great passiveresistance, but it has no purpose in its round but crops and crops, to keep outof debt and hoard against bad times. So it has remained to our own days over thegreater part of Europe and Asia.4. Differing widely in origin and quality from the tillers of the soil was theartisan class. At first, this was probably in part a town-slave class, in partit consisted of peasants who had specialized upon a craft. But in developing anart and mystery of its own, a technique that had to be learnt before it could bepractised, each sort of craft probably developed a certain independence and acertain sense of community of its own. The artisans were able to get togetherand discuss their affairs more readily than the toilers on the land, and theywere able to form guilds to restrict output, maintain rates of pay, and protecttheir common interest.5. As the power of the Babylonian rulers spread out beyond the original areas ofgood husbandry into grazing regions and less fertile districts, a class ofherdsmen, came into existence. In the case of Babylonia these were nomadicSemites, the Bedouin, like the Bedouin of today. They probably grazed theirflocks over great areas much as the sheep ranchers of California do. They werepaid and esteemed much more highly than the husbandmen.6. The first merchants in the world were shipowners like the people of Tyre andCnossos, or nomads who carried and traded goods as they wandered between onearea of primitive civilization and another. In the Babylonian and Assyrian worldthe traders were predominantly the Semitic Arameans, the ancestors of the modernSyrians. They became a distinct factor in the life of the community; they formedgreat households of their own. Usury developed largely in the last thousandyears BC. Traders needed accommodation; cultivators wished to anticipate theircrops. Sayce (op. cit.) gives an account of the Babylonian banking-house ofEgibi, which lasted through several generations and outlived the ChaldeanEmpire.7. A class of small retailers, one must suppose, came into existence with thecomplication of society during the later days of the first empires, but it wasnot probably of any great importance.8. A growing class of independent property owners.9. As the amenities of life increased, there grew up in the court, temples, andprosperous private houses a class of domestic servants, slaves or freed slave,or young peasants taken into the household.10. Gang workers. These were prisoners of war or debt slaves, or impressed ordeported men.11. Mercenary soldiers. These were also often captives or impressed men.Sometimes they were enlisted from friendly foreign populations in which themilitary spirit still prevailed.12. Seamen.In modern political and economic discussions we are apt to talk rather glibly of“labour.” Much has been made of the solidarity of labour and its sense ofcommunity. It is well to note that in these first civilizations, what we speakof as “labour” is represented by five distinct classes dissimilar in origin,traditions, and outlook—namely, classes 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and the oar-tugging partof 12. The “solidarity of labour” is, we shall find when we come to study themechanical revolution of the nineteenth century AD, a new idea and a newpossibility in human affairs.§ 5Let us, before we leave this discussion of the social classes that weredeveloping in these first civilizations, devote a little attention to theirfixity. How far did they stand aloof from each other, and how far did theyintermingle? So far as the classes we have counted as 9, 10, 11, and 12 go, theservants, the gang labourers and slaves, the gang soldiers, and to a lesserextent the sailors, or at any rate the galley rowers among the sailors, theywere largely recruited classes, they did not readily and easily form homes, theywere not distinctively breeding classes; they were probably replenishedgeneration after generation by captives, by the failures of other classes, andespecially from the failures of the class of small retailers, and by persuasionand impressment from among the cultivators. But so far as the sailors go, wehave to distinguish between the mere rower and the navigating and shipowningseaman of such ports as Tyre and Sidon. The shipowners pass, no doubt, byinsensible gradations into the mercantile class, but the navigators must havemade a peculiar community in the great seaports, having homes there and handingon the secrets of seacraft to their sons. The eighth class we have distinguishedwas certainly a precarious class, continually increased by the accession of theheirs and dependents, the widows and retired members of the wealthy andpowerful, and continually diminished by the deaths or speculative losses ofthese people and the dispersal of their properties. The priests and priestess,too, so far as all this world west of India went, were not a very reproductiveclass; many priesthoods were celibate, and that class, too, may also be countedas a recruited class. Nor are servants, as a rule, reproductive. They live inthe households of other people; they do not have households and rear largefamilies of their own. This leaves us as the really vital classes of the ancientcivilized community:a. The royal and aristocratic class, officials, military officers, and the like;b. The mercantile class;c. The town artisans;d. The cultivators of the soil; ande. The herdsmen. Each of these classes reared its own children in its own fashion, and sonaturally kept itself more or less continuously distinct from the others.General education was not organized in those ancient states, education wasmainly a household matter (as it is still in many parts of India today), and soit was natural and necessary for the sons to follow in the footsteps of theirfather and to marry women accustomed to their own sort of household. Exceptduring times of great political disturbance, therefore, there would be a naturaland continuous separation of classes; which would not, however, preventexceptional individuals from intermarrying or passing from one class to another.Poor aristocrats would marry rich members of the mercantile class; ambitiousherdsmen, artisans, or sailors would become rich merchants. So far as one cangather, that was the general state of affairs in both Egypt and Babylonia. Theidea was formerly entertained that in Egypt there was a fixity of classes, butthis appears to be a misconception due to a misreading of Herodotus. The onlyexclusive class in Egypt which did not intermarry was, as in England today, thesemi-divine royal family.At various points in the social system there were probably developments ofexclusiveness, an actual barring out of interlopers. Artisans of particularcrafts possessing secrets, for example, have among all races and in all agestended to develop guild organizations restricting the practice of their craftand the marriage of members outside their guild. Conquering people have also,and especially when there were marked physical differences of race, beendisposed to keep themselves aloof from the conquered peoples, and have developedan aristocratic exclusiveness. Such organizations of restriction upon freeintercourse have come and gone in great variety in the history of alllongstanding civilizations. The natural boundaries of function were alwaysthere, but sometimes they have been drawn sharply and laid stress upon, andsometimes they have been made little of. There has been a general tendency amongthe Aryan peoples to distinguish noble (patrician) from common (plebeian)families; the traces of it are evident throughout the literature and life ofEurope today, and it has received a picturesque enforcement in the “science” ofheraldry. This tradition is still active even in democratic America. Germany,the most methodical of European countries, had in the Middle Ages a very clearconception of the fixity of such distinctions. Below the princes (who themselvesconstituted an exclusive class which did not marry beneath itself) there werethe:a. Knights, the military and official caste, with heraldic coats-of-arms;b. and c. The Bürgerstand, the merchants, shipping people, and artisans; andd. The Bauernstand, the cultivating serfs or peasants.Mediæval Germany went as far as any of the Western heirs of the first greatcivilizations towards a fixation of classes. The idea is far less congenial bothto the English-speaking people and to the French and Italians, who, by a sort ofinstinct, favour a free movement from class to class. Such exclusive ideas beganat first among, and were promoted chiefly by, the upper classes, but it is anatural response and a natural Nemesis to such ideas that the mass of theexcluded should presently range themselves in antagonism to their superiors. Itwas in Germany, as we shall see in the concluding chapters of this story, thatthe conception of a natural and necessary conflict, “the class war,” between themiscellaneous multitudes of the disinherited (“the class-conscious proletariat”of the Marxist) and the rulers and merchants first arose. It was an idea moreacceptable to the German mind than to the British or French. . . . But before wecome to that conflict, we must traverse a long history of many centuries.§ 6If now we turn eastward from this main development of civilization in the worldbetween Central Asia and the Atlantic, to the social development of India in the2,000 years next before the Christian era, we find certain broad and veryinteresting differences. The first of these is that we find such a fixity ofclasses in process of establishment as no other part of the world can present.This fixity of classes is known to Europeans as the institution of caste;2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en65] its origins are still in completeobscurity, but it was certainly well rooted in the Ganges valley before the daysof Alexander the Great. It is a complicated horizontal division of the socialstructure into classes or castes, the members of which may neither eat norintermarry with persons of a lower caste under penalty of becoming outcasts, andwho may also “lose caste” for various ceremonial negligences and defilements. Bylosing caste a man does not sink to a lower caste; he becomes outcast. Thevarious subdivisions of caste are very complex; many are practically tradeorganizations. Each caste has its local organization which maintains discipline,distributes various charities, looks after its own poor, protects the commoninterests of its members, and examines the credentials of newcomers from otherdistricts. (There is little to check the pretensions of a travelling Hindu to beof a higher caste than is legitimately his). Originally, the four main castesseem to have been:The Brahmins—the priests and teachers;The Kshatriyas—the warriors;The Vaisyas—herdsmen, merchants, moneylenders, and landowners;The Sudras;And, outside the castes, the Pariahs.But these primary divisions have long been complicated by subdivision into amultitude of minor castes, all exclusive, each holding its members to onedefinite way of living and one group of associates. In Bengal the Kshatriyas andVaisyas have largely disappeared. But this is too intricate a question for us todeal with here in any detail.Next to this extraordinary fission and complication of the social body we haveto note that the Brahmins, the priests and teachers of the Indian world, unlikeso many Western priesthoods, are a reproductive and exclusive class, taking norecruits from any other social stratum.Whatever may have been the original incentive to this extensive fixation ofclass in India, there can be little doubt of the role played by the Brahmins asthe custodians of tradition and the only teachers of the people in sustainingit. By some it is supposed that the first three of the four original castes,known also as the “twice born,” were the descendants of the Vedic Aryanconquerors of India, who established these hard-and-fast separations to preventracial mixing with the conquered Sudras and Pariahs. The Sudras are representedas a previous wave of northern conquerors, and the Pariahs are the originalDravidian inhabitants of India. But these speculations are not universallyaccepted, and it is, perhaps, rather the case that the uniform conditions oflife in the Ganges valley throughout long centuries served to stereotype adifference of classes that have never had the same steadfastness of definitionunder the more various and variable conditions of the greater world to the west.However caste arose, there can be no doubt of its extraordinary hold upon theIndian mind. In the sixth century BC arose Gautama, the great teacher ofBuddhism, proclaiming, “As the four streams that flow into the Ganges lose theirnames as soon as they mingle their waters in the holy river, so all who believein Buddha cease to be Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras.” His teachingprevailed in India for some centuries; it spread over China, Tibet, Japan,Burmah, Ceylon, Turkestan, Manchuria; it is today the religion of a largefraction of the human race, but it was finally defeated and driven out of Indianlife by the vitality and persistence of the Brahmins and of their caste ideas. .. .§ 7In China we find a social system travelling along yet another, and only a veryroughly parallel line to that followed by the Indian and Western civilizations.The Chinese civilization even more than the Hindu is organized for peace, andthe warrior plays a small part in its social scheme. As in the Indiancivilization, the leading class is an intellectual one; less priestly than theBrahmin and more official. But unlike the Brahmins, the mandarins, who are theliterate men of China, are not a caste; one is not a mandarin by birth, but byeducation; they are drawn by education and examination from all classes of thecommunity, and the son of a mandarin has no prescriptive right to succeed hisfather.3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en66] As a consequence of thesedifferences, while the Brahmins of India are, as a class, ignorant even of theirown sacred books, mentally slack, and full of a pretentious assurance, theChinese mandarin has the energy that comes from hard mental work. But since hiseducation so far has been almost entirely a scholarly study of the classicalChinese literature, his influence has been entirely conservative. Before thedays of Alexander the Great, China had already formed itself and set its feet inthe way in which it was still walking in the year 1000 AD. Invaders anddynasties had come and gone, but the routine of life of the yellow civilizationremained unchanged.The traditional Chinese social system recognized four main classes below thepriest-emperor.a. . The literary class, which was equivalent partly to the officials of theWestern world and partly to its teachers and clerics. In the time of Confuciusits education included archery and horsemanship. Rites and music, history andmathematics completed the “Six Accomplishments.”b. . The cultivators of the land.c. . The artisans.d. . The mercantile class.But since from the earliest times it has been the Chinese way to divide thelanded possessions of a man among all his sons, there has never been in Chinesehistory any class of great landowners, renting their land to tenants, such asmost other countries have displayed. The Chinese land has always been cut upinto small holdings, which are chiefly freeholds, and cultivated intensively.There are landlords in China who own one or a few farms and rent them totenants, but there are no great, permanent estates. When a patch of land, byrepeated division, is too small to sustain a man, it is sold to some prosperingneighbour, and the former owner drifts to one of the great towns of China tojoin the mass of wage-earning workers there. In China, for many centuries, therehave been these masses of town population with scarcely any property at all, menneither serfs nor slaves, but held to their daily work by their utterimpecuniousness. From such masses it is that the soldiers needed by the ChineseGovernment are recruited, and also such gang labour as has been needed for themaking of canals, the building of walls, and the like has been drawn. The warcaptive and the slave class play a smaller part in Chinese history than inanymore westerly record of these ages before the Christian era.One fact, we may note, is common to all these three stories of developing socialstructure and that is the immense power exercised by the educated class in theearly stages before the crown or the commonalty began to read and, consequently,to think for itself. In India, by reason of their exclusiveness, the Brahmins,the educated class, retain their influence to this day; over the masses ofChina, along entirely different lines and because of the complexities of thewritten language, the mandarinate has prevailed. The diversity of race andtradition in the more various and eventful world of the West has delayed, andperhaps arrested forever, any parallel organization of the speciallyintellectual elements of society into a class ascendancy. In the Western world,as we have already noted, education early “slopped over,” and soaked away out ofthe control of any special class; it escaped from the limitation of castes andpriesthoods and traditions into the general life of the community. Writing andreading had been simplified down to a point when it was no longer possible tomake a cult and mystery of them. It may be due to the peculiar elaboration anddifficulty of the Chinese characters, rather than to any racial difference, thatthe same thing did not happen to the same extent in China.§ 8In these last six chapters we have traced in outline the whole process by which,in the course of 5,000 or 6,000 years—that is to say, in something between 150and 200 generations—mankind passed from the stage of early Neolithic husbandry,in which the primitive skin-clad family tribe reaped and stored in their rudemud huts the wild-growing fodder and grain-bearing grasses with sickles ofstone, to the days of the fourth century BC, when all round the shores of theMediterranean and up the Nile, and across Asia to India, and again over thegreat alluvial areas of China, spread the fields of human cultivation and busycities, great temples, and the coming and going of human commerce. Galleys andlateen-sailed ships entered and left crowded harbours, and made their carefulway from headland to headland and from headland to island, keeping always closeto the land. Phœnician shipping under Egyptian owners was making its way intothe East Indies and perhaps even further into the Pacific. Across the deserts ofAfrica and Arabia and through Turkestan toiled the caravans with their remotetrade; silk was already coming from China, ivory from Central Africa, and tinfrom Britain to the centres of this new life in the world. Men had learnt toweave fine linen4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en67] and delicate fabricsof coloured wool; they could bleach and dye; they had iron as well as copper,bronze, silver, and gold; they had made the most beautiful pottery andporcelain; there was hardly a variety of precious stone in the world that theyhad not found and cut and polished; they could read and write; divert the courseof rivers, pile pyramids, and make walls a thousand miles long. The fifty orsixty centuries in which all this had to be achieved may seem a long time incomparison with the threescore and ten years of a single human life, but it isutterly inconsiderable in comparison with the stretches of geological time.Measuring backward from these Alexandrian cities to the days of the first stoneimplements, the rostro-carinate implements of the Pliocene Age, gives us anextent of time fully a hundred times as long.We have tried in this account, and with the help of maps and figures and timecharts, to give a just idea of the order and shape of these fifty or sixtycenturies. Our business is with that outline. We have named but a few names ofindividuals; though henceforth the personal names must increase in number. Butthe content of this outline that we have drawn here in a few diagrams and chartscannot but touch the imagination. If only we could look closelier, we should seethrough all these sixty centuries a procession of lives more and more akin intheir fashion to our own. We have shown how the naked Palæolithic savage gaveplace to the Neolithic cultivator, a type of man still to be found in thebackward places of the world. We have given an illustration of Sumerian soldierscopied from a carved stone that was set up long before the days when the SemiticSargon I conquered the land. Day by day some busy brownish man carved thosefigures, and, no doubt, whistled as he carved. In those days the plain of theEgyptian delta was crowded with gangs of swarthy workmen unloading the stonethat had come down the Nile to add a fresh course to the current pyramid. Onemight paint a thousand scenes from those ages: of some hawker merchant in Egyptspreading his stock of Babylonish garments before the eyes of some pretty, richlady; of a miscellaneous crowd swarming between the pylons to some templefestival at Thebes; of an excited, dark-eyed audience of Cretans like theSpaniards of today, watching a bull-fight, with the bullfighters in trousers andtightly girded, exactly like any contemporary bullfighter; of children learningtheir cuneiform signs—at Nippur the clay exercise tiles of a school have beenfound; of a woman with a sick husband at home slipping into some great temple inCarthage to make a vow for his recovery. Or perhaps it is a wild Greek,skin-clad and armed with a bronze axe, standing motionless on some Illyrianmountain crest, struck with amazement at his first vision of a many-oared Cretangalley crawling like a great insect across the amethystine mirror of theAdriatic Sea. He went home to tell his folk a strange story of a monster,Briareus with his hundred arms. Of millions of such stitches in each of thesetwo hundred generations is the fabric of this history woven. But unless theymark the presence of a primary seam or join, we cannot pause now to examine anyof these stitches."},{"pageContent":"098 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_098_r1.gif]CHAPTER NINETEEN 099[bano_9781411428843_oeb_099_r1.gif]THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES AND THE PROPHETS§ 1. THE PLACE OF THE ISRAELITES IN HISTORY. § 2. SAUL, DAVID, AND SOLOMON. § 3.THE JEWS A PEOPLE OF MIXED ORIGIN. § 4. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEBREW PROPHETS.§ 1WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION TO PLACE IN THEIR PROPER RELATIONSHIP TO this generaloutline of human history the Israelites, and the most remarkable collection ofancient documents in the world, that collection which is known to all Christianpeoples as the Old Testament. We find in these documents the most interestingand valuable lights upon the development of civilization, and the clearestindications of a new spirit that was coming into human affairs during thestruggles of Egypt and Assyria for predominance in the world of men.All the books that constitute the Old Testament were certainly in existence, andin very much their present form, at latest by the year 100 BC. Most of them wereprobably recognized as sacred writings in the time of Alexander the Great (330BC). They were the sacred literature of a people, the Jews, who, except for asmall remnant of common people, had recently been deported to Babylonia fromtheir own country in 587 BC by Nebuchadnezzar II, the Chaldean. They hadreturned to their city, Jerusalem, and had rebuilt their temple there under theauspices of Cyrus, that Persian conqueror who, we have already noted, in 539 BCoverthrew Nabonidus, the last of the Chaldean rulers in Babylon. The BabylonianCaptivity had lasted about fifty years, and many authorities are of opinion thatthere was a considerable admixture during that period both of race and ideaswith the Babylonians.The position of the land of Judea and of Jerusalem, its capital, is a peculiarone. The country is a band-shaped strip between the Mediterranean to the westand the desert beyond the Jordan to the east; through it lies the naturalhigh-road between the Hittites, Syria, Assyria, and Babylonia to the north andEgypt to the south. It was a country predestined, therefore, to a stormyhistory. Across it Egypt, and whatever power was ascendant in the north, foughtfor empire; against its people they fought for a trade route. It had itselfneither the area, the agricultural possibilities, nor the mineral wealth to beimportant. The story of its people that these scriptures have preserved runslike a commentary to the greater history of the two systems of civilization tothe north and south and of the sea peoples to the west.These scriptures consist of a number of different elements. The first fivebooks, the Pentateuch, were early regarded with peculiar respect. They begin inthe form of a universal history with a double account of the Creation of theworld and mankind, of the early life of the race, and of a great Flood by which,except for certain favoured individuals, mankind was destroyed. This flood storyis very widely distributed in ancient traditions; it may be a memory of thatflooding of the Mediterranean valley which occurred in the Neolithic age ofmankind. Excavations have revealed Babylonian versions of both the Creationstory and the Flood story of prior date to the restoration of the Jews, and itis therefore argued by Biblical critics that these opening chapters wereacquired by the Jews during their captivity. They constitute the first tenchapters of Genesis.There follows a history of the fathers and founders of the Hebrew nation,Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They are presented as patriarchal Bedouin chiefs,living the life of nomadic shepherds in the country between Babylonia and Egypt.The existing Biblical account is said by the critics to be made up out ofseveral pre-existing versions; but whatever its origins, the story, as we haveit today, is full of colour and vitality. What is called Palestine today was atthat time the land of Canaan, inhabited by a Semitic people called theCanaanites, closely related to the Phœnicians who founded Tyre and Sidon, and tothe Amorites who took Babylon and, under Hammurabi, founded the first BabylonianEmpire. The Canaanites were a settled folk in the days—which were perhapscontemporary with the days of Hammurabi—when Abraham’s flocks and herds passedthrough the land. The God of Abraham, says the Bible narrative, promised thissmiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his children. To the book ofGenesis the reader must go to read how Abraham, being childless, doubted thispromise, and of the births of Ishmael and Isaac. And in Genesis, too, he willfind the lives of Isaac and Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, and of thetwelve sons of Israel; and how in the days of a great famine they went down intoEgypt. With that, Genesis, the first book of the Pentateuch, ends. The nextbook, Exodus, is concerned with the story of Moses.100 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_100_r1.gif]The story of the settlement and slavery of the children of Israel in Egypt is adifficult one. There is an Egyptian record of a settlement of certain Semiticpeoples in the land of Goshen by the Pharaoh Rameses II, and it is stated thatthey were drawn into Egypt by want of food. But of the life and career of Mosesthere is no Egyptian record at all; there is no account of any plagues of Egyptor of any Pharaoh who was drowned in the Red Sea.Very perplexing is the discovery of a clay tablet written by the Egyptiangovernors of a city in Canaan to the Pharaoh Amenophis IV, who came in theXVIIIth Dynasty before Rameses II, apparently mentioning the Hebrews by name anddeclaring that they are overrunning Canaan. Manifestly, if the Hebrews wereconquering Canaan in the time of the XVIIIth Dynasty, they could not have beenmade captive and oppressed, before they conquered Canaan, by Rameses II of theXIXth Dynasty. But it is quite understandable that the Exodus story, writtenlong after the events it narrates, may have concentrated and simplified, andperhaps personified and symbolized, what was really a long and complicatedhistory of tribal invasions. One Hebrew tribe may have drifted down into Egyptand become enslaved, while the others were already attacking the outlyingCanaanite cities. It is even possible that the land of the captivity was notEgypt (Hebrew, Misraim), but Misrim in the north of Arabia, on the other side ofthe Red Sea. These questions are discussed fully and acutely in the EncyclopœdiaBiblica (articles Moses and Exodus), to which the curious reader must bereferred.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en68]Two other books of the Pentateuch, Deuteronomy and Leviticus, are concerned withthe Law and the priestly rules. The book of Numbers takes up the wanderings ofthe Israelites in the desert and their invasion of Canaan.Whatever the true particulars of the Hebrew invasion of Canaan may be, there canbe no doubt that the country they invaded had changed very greatly since thedays of the legendary promise, made centuries before, to Abraham. Then it seemsto have been largely a Semitic land, with many prosperous trading cities. Butgreat waves of strange peoples had washed along this coast. We have already toldhow the dark Iberian or Mediterranean peoples of Italy and Greece, the peoplesof that Ægean civilization which culminated at Cnossos, were being assailed bythe southward movement of Aryan-speaking races, such as the Italians and Greeks,and how Cnossos was sacked about 1400 BC, and destroyed altogether about 1000BC. It is now evident that the people of these Ægean seaports were crossing thesea in search of securer land nests. They invaded the Egyptian delta and theAfrican coast to the west, they formed alliances with the Hittites and otherAryan or Aryanized races. This happened after the time of Rameses II, in thetime of Rameses III. Egyptian monuments record great sea fights, and also amarch of these people along the coast of Palestine towards Egypt. Theirtransport was in the oxcarts characteristic of the Aryan tribes, and it is clearthat these Cretans were acting in alliance with some early Aryan invaders. Noconnected narrative of these conflicts that went on between 1300 BC and 1000 BChas yet been made out, but it is evident from the Bible narrative, that when theHebrews under Joshua pursued their slow subjugation of the promised land, theycame against a new people, the Philistines, unknown to Abraham,2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en69] who were settling along the coast in aseries of cities of which Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon, and Joppa became thechief, who were really, like the Hebrews, newcomers, and probably chiefly theseCretans from the sea and from the north. The invasion, therefore, that began asan attack upon the Canaanites, speedily became a long and not very successfulstruggle for the coveted and promised land with these much more formidablenewcomers, the Philistines.It cannot be said that the promised land was ever completely in the grasp of theHebrews. Following after the Pentateuch in the Bible come the books of Joshua,Judges, Ruth (a digression), Samuel I and II, and Kings I and II, withChronicles repeating with variation much of the matter of Samuel II and Kings;there is a growing flavour of reality in most of this latter history, and inthese books we find the Philistines steadfastly in possession of the fertilelowlands of the south, and the Canaanites and Phœnicians holding out against theIsraelites in the north. The first triumphs of Joshua are not repeated. The bookof Judges is a melancholy catalogue of failures. The people lose heart. Theydesert the worship of their own god Jehovah, and worship Baal and Ashtaroth(=Bel and Ishtar). They mixed their race with the Philistines, with theHittites, and so forth, and became, as they have always subsequently been, aracially mixed people. Under a series of wise men and heroes they wage agenerally unsuccessful and never very united warfare against their enemies. Insuccession they are conquered by the Moabites, the Canaanites, the Midianites,and the Philistines. The story of these conflicts, of Gideon and of Samson andthe other heroes who now and then cast a gleam of hope upon the distress ofIsrael, is told in the book of Judges. In the first book of Samuel is told thestory of their great disaster at Ebenezer in the days when Eli was judge.This was a real pitched battle in which the Israelites lost thirty thousand (!)men. They had previously suffered a reverse and lost four thousand men, and thenthey brought out their most sacred symbol, the Ark of the Covenant of God.And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israelshouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. And when thePhilistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What meaneth the noise ofthis great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?” And they understood that the arkof the Lord was come into the camp. And the Philistines were afraid, for theysaid, “God is come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe unto us! For there hathnot been such a thing heretofore. Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of thehand of these mighty Gods? These are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with allthe plagues in the wilderness. Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O yePhilistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:quit yourselves like men, and fight.”And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man intohis tent: and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of Israel thirtythousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophniand Phinehas, were slain.And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the sameday, with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. And when he came, lo,Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the arkof God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city criedout. And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What meaneth thenoise of this tumult?” And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. Now Eli wasninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim that he could not see. And theman said unto Eli, “I am he that came out of the army, and I fled today out ofthe army.” And he said, “What is there done, my son?” And the messenger answeredand said, “Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also agreat slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,are dead, and the ark of God is taken.” And it came to pass, when he mademention of the ark of God, that Eli fell from off the seat backward, by the sideof the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy.And he had judged Israel forty years.And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered:and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that herfather in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed: forher pains came upon her. And about the time of her death the women that stood byher said unto her, “Fear not, for thou hast borne a son.” But she answered not,neither did she regard it. And she named the child I-chabod,3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en70] saying, “The glory is departed fromIsrael”: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law andher husband.(I Sam., chap. iv).The successor of Eli and the last of the judges was Samuel, and at the end ofhis rule came an event in the history of Israel which paralleled and wassuggested by the experience of the greater nations around. A king arose. We aretold in vivid language the plain issue between the more ancient rule ofpriestcraft and the newer fashion in human affairs. It is impossible to avoid asecond quotation.Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuelunto Ramah, and said unto him: “Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not inthy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, “Hearken untothe voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have notrejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.According to all the works which they have done since the day that I broughtthem up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, andserve other gods, so do they also unto thee. Now, therefore, hearken unto theirvoice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of theking that shall reign over them.”And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him aking. And he said, “This will be the manner of the king that shall reign overyou: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, andto be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. And he will appointhim captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to earhis ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, andinstruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to beconfectioners, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take your fields,and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them tohis servants. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,and give to his officers, and to his servants. And he will take yourmenservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and yourasses, and put them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and yeshall be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your kingwhich ye shall have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.”Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said,“Nay; but we will have a king over us; that we also may be like all the nations;and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.” (ISam., chap. viii).§ 2But the nature and position of their land was against the Hebrews, and theirfirst king Saul was no more successful than their judges. The long intrigues ofthe adventurer David against Saul are told in the rest of the first book ofSamuel, and the end of Saul was utter defeat upon Mount Gilboa. His army wasoverwhelmed by the Philistine archers.And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain,that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa. And they cut offhis head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistinesround about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth; and they fastened his body tothe wall of Bethshan. (I Sam., chap. xxxi).David (990 BC roughly) was more politic and successful than his predecessor, andhe seems to have placed himself under the protection of Hiram, King of Tyre.This Phœnician alliance sustained him, and was the essential element in thegreatness of his son Solomon. His story, with its constant assassinations andexecutions, reads rather like the history of some savage chief than of acivilized monarch. It is told with great vividness in the second book of Samuel.The first book of Kings begins with the reign of King Solomon (960 BC roughly).The most interesting thing in that story, from the point of view of the generalhistorian, is the relationship of Solomon to the national religion and thepriesthood, and his dealings with the tabernacle, the priest Zadok, and theprophet Nathan.The opening of Solomon’s reign is as bloody as his father’s. The last recordedspeech of David arranges for the murder of Shimei; his last recorded word is“blood.” “But his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood,” he says,pointing out that though old Shimei is protected by a vow David had made to theLord so long as David lives, there is nothing to bind Solomon in that matter.Solomon proceeds to murder his brother, who has sought the throne but quailedand made submission. He then deals freely with his brother’s party. The weakhold of religion upon the racially and mentally confused Hebrews at that time isshown by the ease with which he replaces the hostile chief priest by his ownadherent Zadok, and still more strikingly by the murder of Joab by Benaiah,Solomon’s chief ruffian, in the tabernacle, while the victim is claimingsanctuary and holding to the very horns of Jehovah’s altar. Then Solomon sets towork, in what was for that time a thoroughly modern spirit, to recast thereligion of his people. He continues the alliance with Hiram, King of Sidon, whouses Solomon’s kingdom, as a high road by which to reach and build shipping uponthe Red Sea, and a hitherto unheard of wealth accumulates in Jesusalem as aresult of this partnership. Gang labour appears in Israel; Solomon sends relaysof men to cut cedarwood in Lebanon under Hiram, and organizes a service ofporters through the land. (There is much in all this to remind the reader of therelations of some Central African chief to a European trading concern). Solomonthen builds a palace for himself, and a temple not nearly as big for Jehovah.Hitherto, the Ark of the Covenant, the divine symbol of these ancient Hebrews,had abode in a large tent, which had been shifted from one high place toanother, and sacrifices had been offered to the God of Israel upon a number ofdifferent high places. Now the ark is brought into the golden splendours of theinner chamber of a temple of cedar-sheathed stone, and put between two greatwinged figures of gilded olivewood, and sacrifices are henceforth to be madeonly upon the altar before it.This centralizing innovation will remind the reader of both Akhnaton andNabonidus. Such things as this are done successfully only when the prestige andtradition and learning of the priestly order has sunken to a very low level.And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of thepriests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise andminister before the priests, as the duty of everyday required; the porters alsoby their courses at every gate; for so had David the man of God commanded. Andthey departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priest and Levitesconcerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.Neither Solomon’s establishment of the worship of Jehovah in Jerusalem upon thisnew footing, nor his vision of and conversation with his God at the opening ofhis reign, stood in the way of his developing a sort of theologicalflirtatiousness in his declining years. He married widely, if only for reasonsof state and splendour, and he entertained his numerous wives by sacrificing totheir national deities, to the Sidonian goddess Ashtaroth (Ishtar), to Chemosh(a Moabitish god), to Moloch, and so forth. The Bible account of Solomon does,in fact, show us a king and a confused people, both superstitious and mentallyunstable, in no way more religious than any other people of the surroundingworld.A point of considerable interest in the story of Solomon, because it marks aphase in Egyptian affairs, is his marriage to a daughter of Pharaoh. This musthave been one of the Pharaohs of the XXIst Dynasty. In the great days ofAmenophis III, as the Tel-Amarna letters witness, Pharaoh could condescend toreceive a Babylonian princess into his harem, but he refused absolutely to grantso divine a creature as an Egyptian princess in marriage to the Babylonianmonarch. It points to the steady decline of Egyptian prestige that now, threecenturies later, such a petty monarch as Solomon could wed on equal terms withan Egyptian princess. There was, however, a revival with the next Egyptiandynasty (XXII); and the Pharaoh Shishak, the founder, taking advantage of thecleavage between Israel and Judah, which had been developing through the reignsof both David and Solomon, took Jerusalem and looted the all-too-briefsplendours both of the new temple and of the king’s house.Shishak seems also to have subjugated Philistia. From this time onward it is tobe noted that the Philistines fade in importance. They had already lost theirCretan language and adopted that of the Semites they had conquered, and althoughtheir cities remain more or less independent, they merge gradually into thegeneral Semitic life of Palestine.There is evidence that the original rude but convincing narrative of Solomon’srule, of his various murders, of his association with Hiram, of his palace andtemple building, and the extravagances that weakened and finally tore hiskingdom in twain, has been subjected to extensive interpolations and expansionsby a later writer, anxious to exaggerate his prosperity and glorify his wisdom.It is not the place here to deal with the criticism of Bible origins, but it isa matter of ordinary common sense rather than of scholarship to note themanifest reality and veracity of the main substance of the account of David andSolomon, an account explaining sometimes and justifying sometimes, butnevertheless relating facts, even the harshest facts, as only a contemporary oralmost contemporary writer, convinced that they cannot be concealed, wouldrelate them, and then to remark the sudden lapse into adulation when theinserted passages occur. It is a striking tribute to the power of the writtenassertion over realities in men’s minds that this Bible narrative has imposed,not only upon the Christian but upon the Moslem world, the belief that KingSolomon was not only one of the most magnificent, but one of the wisest of men.Yet the first book of Kings tells in detail his utmost splendours, and besidethe beauty and wonder of the buildings and organizations of such great monarchsas Thotmes III or Rameses II or half a dozen other Pharaohs, or of Sargon II orSardanapalus or Nebuchadnezzar the Great, they are trivial. His temple measuredinternally was twenty cubits broad, about 35 feet4[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en71]—that is, the breadth of a small villaresidence—and sixty cubits, say 100 feet, long. And as for his wisdom andstatescraft, one need go no further than the Bible to see that Solomon was amere helper in the wide-reaching schemes of the trader-king Hiram, and hiskingdom a pawn between Phœnicia and Egypt. His importance was due largely to thetemporary enfeeblement of Egypt, which encouraged the ambition of the Phœnicianand made it necessary to propitiate the holder of the key to an alternate traderoute to the East. To his own people Solomon was a wasteful and oppressivemonarch, and already before his death his kingdom was splitting, visibly to allmen.With the reign of King Solomon the brief glory of the Hebrews ends; the northernand richer section of his kingdom, long oppressed by taxation to sustain hissplendours, breaks off from Jerusalem to become the separate kingdom of Israel,and this split ruptures that linking connection between Sidon and the Red Sea bywhich Solomon’s gleam of wealth was possible. There is no more wealth in Hebrewhistory. Jerusalem remains the capital of one tribe, the tribe of Judah, thecapital of a land of barren hills, cut off by Philistia from the sea andsurrounded by enemies.The tale of wars, of religious conflicts, of usurpations, assassinations, and offratricidal murders to secure the throne goes on for three centuries. It is atale frankly barbaric. Israel wars with Judah and the neighbouring states; formsalliances first with one and then with the other. The power of Aramean Syriaburns like a baleful star over the affairs of the Hebrews, and then there risesbehind it the great and growing power of the last Assyrian empire. For threecenturies the life of the Hebrews was like the life of a man who insists uponliving in the middle of a busy thorough-fare, and is consequently being run overconstantly by omnibuses and motor-lorries.“Pul” (apparently the same person as Tiglath Pileser III) is, according to theBible narrative, the first Assyrian monarch to appear upon the Hebrew horizon,and Menahem buys him off with a thousand talents of silver (738 BC). But thepower of Assyria is heading straight for the now aged and decadent land ofEgypt, and the line of attack lies through Judea; Tiglath Pileser III returnsand Shalmaneser follows in his steps, the King of Israel intrigues for help withEgypt, that “broken reed,” and in 721 BC, as we have already noted, his kingdomis swept off into captivity and utterly lost to history. The same fate hung overJudah, but for a little while it was averted. The fate of Sennacherib’s army inthe reign of King Hezekiah (701 BC), and how he was murdered by his sons (IIKings xix. 37), we have already mentioned. The subsequent subjugation of Egyptby Assyria finds no mention in Holy Writ, but it is clear that before the reignof Sennacherib, King Hezekiah had carried on a diplomatic correspondence withBabylon (700 BC), which was in revolt against Sargon II of Assyria. Therefollowed the conquest of Egypt by Esarhaddon, and then for a time Assyria wasoccupied with her own troubles; the Scythians and Medes and Persians werepressing her on the north, and Babylon was in insurrection. As we have alreadynoted, Egypt, relieved for a time from Assyrian pressure, entered upon a phaseof revival, first under Psammetichus and then under Necho II.Again the little country in between made mistakes in its alliances. But onneither side was there safety. Josiah opposed Necho, and was slain at the battleof Megiddo (608 BC). The king of Judah became an Egyptian tributary. Then whenNecho, after pushing as far as the Euphrates, fell before Nebuchadnezzar II,Judah fell with him (604 BC). Nebuchadnezzar, after a trial of three puppetkings, carried off the greater part of the people into captivity in Babylon (586BC), and the rest, after a rising and a massacre of Babylonian officials, tookrefuge from the vengeance of Chaldea in Egypt.And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures ofthe house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; allthese he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the house of God and brake down thewall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyedall the goodly vessels thereof. And them that had escaped from the sword carriedhe away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reignof the kingdom of Persia. (II Chron. xxxvi. 18, 19, 20).So the four centuries of Hebrew kingship comes to an end. From first to last itwas a mere incident in the larger and greater history of Egypt, Syria, Assyria,and Phœnicia. But out of it there were now to arise moral and intellectualconsequences of primary importance to all mankind.§ 3The Jews who returned, after an interval of more than two generations, toJerusalem from Babylonia in the time of Cyrus were a very different people fromthe warring Baal worshippers and Jehovah worshippers, the sacrificers in thehigh places and sacrificers at Jerusalem of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah.The plain fact of the Bible narrative is that the Jews went to Babylonbarbarians and came back civilized. They went a confused and divided multitude,with no national self-consciousness; they came back with an intense andexclusive national spirit. They went with no common literature generally knownto them, for it was only about forty years before the captivity that King Josiahis said to have discovered “a book of the law” in the temple (II Kings xxii),and, besides that, there is not a hint in the record of any reading of books;and they returned with most of their material for the Old Testament. It ismanifest that, relieved of their bickering and murderous kings, restrained frompolitics and in the intellectually stimulating atmosphere of that Babylonianworld, the Jewish mind made a great step forward during the Captivity.It was an age of historical inquiry and learning in Babylonia. The Babylonianinfluences that had made Sardanapalus collect a great library of ancientwritings in Nineveh were still at work. We have already told how Nabonidus wasso preoccupied with antiquarian research as to neglect the defence of hiskingdom against Cyrus. Everything, therefore, contributed to set the exiled Jewsinquiring into their own history, and they found an inspiring leader in theprophet Ezekiel. From such hidden and forgotten records as they had with them,genealogies, contemporary histories of David, Solomon, and their other kings,legends and traditions, they made out and amplified their own story, and told itto Babylon and themselves. The story of the Creation and the Flood, much of thestory of Moses, much of Samson, were probably incorporated from Babyloniansources.5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en72] When the Jews returned toJerusalem, only the Pentateuch had been put together into one book, but thegrouping of the rest of the historical books was bound to follow.The rest of their literature remained for some centuries as separate books, towhich a very variable amount of respect was paid. Some of the later books arefrankly post-captivity compositions. Over all this literature were throwncertain leading ideas. There was an idea, which even these books themselvesgainsay in detail, that all the people were pureblooded children of Abraham;there was next an idea of a promise made by Jehovah to Abraham that he wouldexalt the Jewish race above all other races; and, thirdly, there was the belieffirst of all that Jehovah was the greatest and most powerful of tribal gods, andthen that he was a god above all other gods, and at last that he was the onlytrue god. The Jews became convinced at last, as a people, that they were thechosen people of the one God of all the earth.And arising very naturally out of these three ideas, was a fourth, the idea of acoming leader, a saviour, a Messiah who would realize the long-postponedpromises of Jehovah.This welding together of the Jews into one tradition-cemented people in thecourse of the “seventy years” is the first instance in history of the new powerof the written word in human affairs. It was a mental consolidation that didmuch more than unite the people who returned to Jerusalem. This idea ofbelonging to a chosen race predestined to preeminence was a very attractive one.It possessed also those Jews who remained in Babylonia. Its literature reachedthe Jews now established in Egypt. It affected the mixed people who had beenplaced in Samaria, the old capital of the kings of Israel when the ten tribeswere deported to Media. It inspired a great number of Babylonians and the liketo claim Abraham as their father, and thrust their company upon the returningJews. Ammonites and Moabites became adherents. The book of Nehemiah is full ofthe distress occasioned by this invasion of the privileges of the chosen. TheJews were already a people dispersed in many lands and cities, when their mindsand hopes were unified and they became an exclusive people. But at first theirexclusiveness is merely to preserve soundness of doctrine and worship, warned bysuch lamentable lapses as those of King Solomon. To genuine proselytes ofwhatever race, Judaism long held out welcoming arms.To Phœnicians after the falls of Tyre and Carthage, conversion to Judaism musthave been particularly easy and attractive. Their language was closely akin toHebrew. It is possible that the great majority of African and Spanish Jews arereally of Phœnician origin. There were also great Arabian accessions. In SouthRussia, as we shall note later, there were even Mongolian Jews.§ 4The historical books from Genesis to Nehemiah, upon which the idea of thepromise to the chosen people had been imposed later, were no doubt the backboneof Jewish mental unity, but they by no means complete the Hebrew literature fromwhich finally the Bible was made up. Of such books as Job, said to be animitation of Greek tragedy, the Song of Solomon, the Psalms, Proverbs, andothers, there is no time to write in this Outline, but it is necessary to dealwith the books known as “the Prophets” with some fullness. For those books arealmost the earliest and certainly the best evidence of the appearance of a newkind of leading in human affairs.These prophets are not a new class in the community; they are of the mostvarious origins—Ezekiel was of the priestly caste and of priestly sympathies,and Amos was a shepherd; but they have this in common, that they bring into lifea religious force outside the sacrifices and formalities of priesthood andtemple. The earlier prophets seem most like the earlier priests, they areoracular, they give advice and foretell events; it is quite possible that atfirst, in the days when there were many high places in the land and religiousideas were comparatively unsettled, there was no great distinction betweenpriest and prophet. The prophets danced, it would seem, somewhat after theDervish fashion, and uttered oracles. Generally they wore a distinctive mantleof rough goatskin. They kept up the nomadic tradition as against the “new ways”of the settlement. But after the building of the temple and the organization ofthe priesthood the prophetic type remains over and outside the formal religiousscheme. They were probably always more or less of an annoyance to the priests.They became informal advisers upon public affairs, denouncers of sin and strangepractices, “self-constituted,” as we should say, having no sanction but an innerlight. “Now the word of the Lord came unto”—so and so; that is the formula.In the latter and most troubled days of the kingdom of Judah, as Egypt, NorthArabia, Assyria, and then Babylonia closed like a vice upon the land, theseprophets became very significant and powerful. Their appeal was to anxious andfearful minds, and at first their exhortation was chiefly towards repentance,the pulling down of this or that high place, the restoration of worship inJerusalem, or the like. But through some of the prophecies there runs already anote like the note of what we call nowadays a “social reformer.” The rich are“grinding the faces of the poor”; the luxurious are consuming the children’sbread; influential and wealthy people make friends with and imitate thesplendours and vices of foreigners, and sacrifice the common people to these newfashions; and this is hateful to Jehovah, who will certainly punish the land.But with the broadening of ideas that came with the Captivity, the tenor ofprophecy broadens and changes. The jealous pettiness that disfigures the earliertribal ideas of God gives place to a new idea of a god of universalrighteousness. It is clear that the increasing influence of prophets was notconfined to the Jewish people; it was something that was going on in those daysall over the Semitic world. The breaking down of nations and kingdoms to formthe great and changing empires of that age, the smashing up of cults andpriesthoods, the mutual discrediting of temple by temple in their rivalries anddisputes—all these influences were releasing men’s minds to a freer and widerreligious outlook. The temples had accumulated great stores of golden vesselsand lost their hold upon the imaginations of men. It is difficult to estimatewhether, amidst these constant wars, life had become more uncertain and unhappythan it had ever been before, but there can be no doubt that men had become moreconscious of its miseries and insecurities. Except for the weak and the women,there remained little comfort or assurance in the sacrifices, ritual, and formaldevotions of the temples. Such was the world to which the later prophets ofIsrael began to talk of the One God, and of a Promise that someday the worldshould come to peace and unity and happiness. This great God that men were nowdiscovering lived in a temple “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”There can be little doubt of a great body of such thought and utterance inBabylonia, Egypt, and throughout the Semitic east. The prophetic books of theBible can be but specimens of the prophesyings of that time. . . .We have already drawn attention to the gradual escape of writing and knowledgefrom their original limitation to the priesthood and the temple precincts, fromthe shell in which they were first developed and cherished. We have takenHerodotus as an interesting specimen of what we have called the freeintelligence of mankind. Now here we are dealing with a similar overflow ofmoral ideas into the general community. The Hebrew prophets, and the steadyexpansion of their ideas towards one God in all the world, is a paralleldevelopment of the free conscience of mankind. From this time onward there runsthrough human thought, now weakly and obscurely, now gathering power, the ideaof one rule in the world, and of a promise and possibility of an active andsplendid peace and happiness in human affairs. From being a temple religion ofthe old type, the Jewish religion becomes, to a large extent, a prophetic andcreative religion of a new type. Prophet succeeds prophet. Later on, as we shalltell, there was born a prophet of unprecedented power, Jesus, whose followersfounded the great universal religion of Christianity. Still later Muhammad,another prophet, appears in Arabia and founds Islam. In spite of verydistinctive features of their own, these two teachers do in a manner arise outof and in succession to these Jewish prophets. It is not the place of thehistorian to discuss the truth and falsity of religion, but it is his businessto record the appearance of great constructive ideas. Two thousand four hundredyears ago, and six or seven or eight thousand years after the walls of the firstSumerian cities arose, the ideas of the moral unity of mankind and of a worldpeace had come into the world.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en73]"},{"pageContent":"101 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_101_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY 102[bano_9781411428843_oeb_102_r1.gif]THE ARYAN - SPEAKING PEOPLES IN PREHISTORIC TIMES§ 1. THE SPREADING OF THE ARYAN-SPEAKERS. § 2. PRIMITIVE ARYAN LIFE. § 3. EARLYARYAN DAILY LIFE.§ 1WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ARYAN LANGUAGE AS PROBABLY ARISING IN THE region of theDanube and South Russia and spreading from that region of origin. We say“probably,” because it is by no means certainly proved that that was the centre;there have been vast discussions upon this point and wide divergences ofopinion. We give the prevalent view. It was originally the language of a groupof peoples of the Nordic race. As it spread widely, Aryan began to differentiateinto a number of subordinate languages. To the west and south it encountered theBasque language, which was then widely spread in Spain, and also possiblyvarious other Mediterranean languages.Before the spreading of the Aryans from their lands of origin southward andwestward, the Iberian race was distributed over Great Britain, Ireland, France,Spain, north Africa, south Italy, and, in a more civilized state, Greece andAsia Minor. It was closely related to the Egyptian. To judge by its Europeanvestiges it was a rather small human type, generally with an oval face and along head. It buried its chiefs and important people in megalithicchambers—i.e., made of big stones—covered over by great mounds of earth; andthese mounds of earth, being much longer than they are broad, are spoken of asthe long barrows. These people sheltered at times in caves, and also buried someof their dead therein; and from the traces of charred, broken, and cut humanbones, including the bones of children, it is inferred that they were cannibals.These short dark Iberian tribes (and the Basques also if they were a differentrace) were thrust back westward, and conquered and enslaved by slowly advancingwaves of the taller and fairer Aryan-speaking people, coming southward andwestward through Central Europe, who are spoken of as the Kelts. Only the Basqueresisted the conquering Aryan speech. Gradually these Keltic-speakers made theirway to the Atlantic, and all that now remains of the Iberians is mixed into theKeltic population. How far the Keltic invasion affected the Irish population isa matter of debate at the present time; in that island the Kelts may have been amere caste of conquerors who imposed their language on a larger subjectpopulation. It is even doubtful if the north of England is more Aryan thanpre-Keltic in blood. There is a sort of short dark Welshman, and certain typesof Irishmen, who are Iberians by race. The modern Portuguese are also largely ofIberian blood.The Kelts spoke a language, Keltic,1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en74]which was also in its turn to differentiate into the language of Gaul, Welsh,Breton, Scotch and Irish Gaelic, and other tongues. They buried the ashes oftheir chiefs and important people in round barrows. While these Nordic Keltswere spreading westward, other Nordic Aryan peoples were pressing down upon thedark white Mediterranean race in the Italian and Greek peninsulas, anddeveloping the Latin and Greek groups of tongues. Certain other Aryan tribeswere drifting towards the Baltic and across into Scandinavia, speaking varietiesof the Aryan which became ancient Norse—the parent of Swedish, Danish,Norwegian, and Icelandic—Gothic, and Low and High German.While the primitive Aryan speech was thus spreading and breaking up intodaughter languages to the west, it was also spreading and breaking up to theeast. North of the Carpathians and the Black Sea, Aryan-speaking tribes wereincreasing and spreading and using a distinctive dialect called Slavonian, fromwhich came Russian, Serbian, Polish, Bulgarian, and other tongues; othervariations of Aryan distributed over Asia Minor and Persia were also beingindividualized as Armenian and Indo-Iranian, the parent of Sanscrit and Persian.In this book we have used the word Aryan for all this family of languages, butthe term Indo-European is sometimes used for the entire family, and “Aryan”itself restricted in a narrower sense to the Indo-Iranian speech. ThisIndo-Iranian speech was destined to split later into a number of languages,including Persian and Sanscrit, the latter being the language of certain tribesof fair-complexioned Aryan speakers who pushed eastward into India somewhenbetween 3000 and 1000 BC and conquered dark Dravidian peoples who were then inpossession of that land.From their original range of wandering, other Aryan tribes spread to the northas well as to the south of the Black Sea, and ultimately, as these seas shrankand made way for them, to the north and east of the Caspian, and so began tocome into conflict with and mix also with Mongolian peoples of the Ural-Altaiclinguistic group the horse-keeping people of the grassy steppes of Central Asia.From these Mongolian races the Aryans seem to have acquired the use of the horsefor riding and warfare. There were three or four prehistoric varieties orsubspecies of horse in Europe and Asia, but it was the steppe or semi-desertlands that first gave horses of a build adapted to other than food uses.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en75] All these peoples, it must beunderstood, shifted their ground rapidly, a succession of bad seasons mightdrive them many hundreds of miles, and it is only in a very rough andprovisional manner that their “beats” can now be indicated. Every summer theywent north, every winter they swung south again. This annual swing coveredsometimes hundreds of miles. On our maps, for the sake of simplicity, werepresent the shifting of nomadic peoples by a straight line; but really theymoved in annual swings, as the broom of a servant who is sweeping out a passageswishes from side to side as she advances. Spreading round the north of theBlack Sea, and probably to the north of the Caspian, from the range of theoriginal Teutonic tribes of Central and North-central Europe to the Iranianpeoples who became the Medes and Persians and (Aryan) Hindus, were the grazinglands of a confusion of tribes, about whom it is truer to be vague than precise,such as the Cimmerians, the Sarmatians, and those Scythians who, together withthe Medes and Persians, came into effective contact with the Assyrian Empire by1000 BC or earlier.East and south of the Black Sea, between the Danube and the Medes and Persians,and to the north of the Semitic and Mediterranean peoples of the seacoasts andpeninsulas, ranged another series of equally ill-defined Aryan tribes, movingeasily from place to place and intermixing freely—to the great confusion ofhistorians. They seem, for instance, to have broken up and assimilated theHittite civilization, which was probably pre-Aryan in its origin. These latterAryans were, perhaps, not so far advanced along the nomadic line as theScythians of the great plains.103 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_103_r1.gif]§ 2What sort of life did these prehistoric Aryans lead, these Nordic Aryans whowere the chief ancestors of most Europeans and most white Americans and Europeancolonists of today, as well as of the Armenians,3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en76] Persians, and high-caste Hindus?In answering that question in addition to the dug-up remains and vestiges uponwhich we have had to rely in the case of the predecessors of the Aryans, we havea new source of knowledge. We have language. By careful study of the Aryanlanguages it has been found possible to deduce a number of conclusions about thelife of these Aryan peoples 5,000 or 4,000 years ago. All these languages have acommon resemblance, as each, as we have already explained, rings the changesupon a number of common roots. When we find the same root word running throughall or most of these tongues, it seems reasonable to conclude that the thingthat root word signifies must have been known to the common ancestors. Ofcourse, if they have exactly the same word in their languages, this may not bethe case; it may be the new name of a new thing or of a new idea that has spreadover the world quite recently. “Gas,” for instance, is a word that was made byVan Helmont, a Dutch chemist, about 1625, and has spread into most civilizedtongues, and “tobacco” again is an American-Indian word which followed theintroduction of smoking almost everywhere. But if the same word turns up in anumber of languages, and if it follows the characteristic modifications of eachlanguage, we may feel sure that it has been in that language, and a part of thatlanguage, since the beginning, suffering the same changes with the rest of it.We know, for example, that the words for waggon and wheel run in this fashionthrough the Aryan tongues, and so we are able to conclude that the primitiveAryans, the more purely Nordic Aryans, had waggons, though it would seem fromthe absence of any common roots for spokes, rim, or axle that their wheels werenot wheelwright’s wheels with spokes, but made of the trunks of trees shaped outwith an axe between the ends.These primitive waggons were drawn by oxen. The early Aryans did not ride ordrive horses; they had very little to do with horses. The Reindeer men were ahorse-people, but the Neolithic Aryans were a cow-people. They ate beef, nothorse; and after many ages they began this use of draught cattle. They reckonedwealth by cows. They wandered, following pasture, and “trekking” their goods, asthe South African Boers do, in ox-waggons, though of course their waggons weremuch clumsier than any to be found in the world today. They probably ranged oververy wide areas. They were migratory, but not in the strict sense of the word“nomadic”; they moved in a slower, clumsier fashion than did the later, morespecialized nomadic peoples. They were forest and parkland people withouthorses. They were developing a migratory life out of the more settled “forestclearing” life of the earlier Neolithic period. Changes of climate which werereplacing forest by pasture, and the accidental burning of forests by fire, mayhave assisted this development.We have already described the sort of home the primitive Aryan occupied and hishousehold life, so far as the remains of the Swiss pile dwellings enable us todescribe these things. Mostly his houses were of too flimsy a sort, probably ofwattle and mud, to have survived, and possibly he left them and trekked on forvery slight reasons. The Aryan peoples burnt their dead, a custom they stillpreserve in India, but their predecessors, the long-barrow people, the Iberians,buried their dead in a sitting position. In some ancient Aryan burial mounds(round barrows) the urns containing the ashes of the departed are shaped likehouses, and these represent rounded huts with thatched roofs. (See Fig., page79).The grazing of the primitive Aryan was far more important to him than hisagriculture. At first he cultivated with a rough wooden hoe; then, after he hadfound out the use of cattle for draught purposes, he began real ploughing withoxen, using at first a suitably bent tree bough as his plough. His firstcultivation before that came about must have been rather in the form of gardenpatches near the house buildings than of fields. Most of the land his tribeoccupied was common land on which the cattle grazed together.He never used stone for building house walls until upon the very verge ofhistory. He used stone for hearths (e.g., at Glastonbury), and sometimes stonesub-structures. He did, however, make a sort of stone house in the centre of thegreat mounds in which he buried the ashes of his illustrious dead. He may havelearnt this custom from his Iberian neighbours and predecessors. It was thesedark whites of the heliolithic culture, and not the primitive Aryans, who wereresponsible for such temples as Stonehenge or Carnac in Brittany.These Aryans were congregated not in cities but in districts of pasturage, asclans and tribal communities. They formed loose leagues of mutual help underchosen leaders, they had centres where they could come together with theircattle in times of danger, and they made camps with walls of earth andpalisades, many of which are still to be traced in the history-worn contours ofthe European scenery. The leaders under whom men fought in war were often thesame men as the sacrificial purifiers who were their early priests.The knowledge of bronze spread late in Europe. The Nordic European had beenmaking his slow advances age by age for 7,000 or 8,000 years before the metalscame. By that time his social life had developed so that there were men ofvarious occupations and men and women of different ranks in the community. Therewere men who worked wood and leather, potters and carvers. The women span andwove and embroidered. There were chiefs and families that were distinguished asleaderly and noble. The Aryan tribesman varied the monotony of his herding andwandering, he consecrated undertakings and celebrated triumphs, held funeralassemblies, and distinguished the traditional seasons of the year, by feasts.His meats we have already glanced at; he was an eager user of intoxicatingdrinks. He made these of honey, of barley, and, as the Aryan speaking tribesspread southward, of the grape. And he got merry and drunken. Whether he firstused yeast to make his bread light or to ferment his drink we do not know.At his feasts there were individuals with a gift for “playing the fool” who didso no doubt to win the laughter of their friends, but there was also anothersort of men, of great importance in their time, and still more important to thehistorian, certain singers of songs and stories, the bards or rhapsodists. Thesebards existed among all the Aryan-speaking peoples; they were a consequence ofand a further factor in that development of spoken language which was the chiefof all the human advances made in Neolithic times. They chanted or recitedstories of the past, or stories of the living chief and his people; they toldother stories that they invented; they memorized jokes and catches. They foundand seized upon and improved the rhythms, rhymes, alliterations, and such-likepossibilities latent in language; they probably did much to elaborate and fixgrammatical forms. They were the first great artists of the ear, as the laterAurignacian rock painters were the first great artists of the eye and hand. Nodoubt they used much gesture; probably they learnt appropriate gestures whenthey learnt their songs; but the order and sweetness and power of language wastheir primary concern.And they mark a new step forward in the power and range of the human mind. Theysustained and developed in men’s minds a sense of a greater something thanthemselves, the tribe, and of a life that extended back into the past. They notonly recalled old hatreds and battles, they recalled old alliances and a commoninheritance. The feats of dead heroes lived again. The Aryans began to live inthought before they were born and after they were dead.Like most human things, this bardic tradition grew first slowly and then morerapidly. By the time bronze was coming into Europe there was not an Aryan peoplethat had not a profession and training of bards. In their hands language becameas beautiful as it is ever likely to be. These bards were living books,man-histories, guardians and makers of a new and more powerful tradition inhuman life. Every Aryan people had its long poetical records thus handed down,its sagas (Teutonic), its epics (Greek), its vedas (Old Sanscrit). The earliestAryan people were essentially a people of the voice. The recitation seems tohave predominated even in those ceremonial and dramatic dances and that“dressing-up” which among most human races have also served for the transmissionof tradition.At that time there was no writing, and when first the art of writing crept intoEurope, as we shall tell later, it must have seemed far too slow, clumsy, andlifeless a method of record for men to trouble very much about writing downthese glowing and beautiful treasures of the memory. Writing was at first keptfor accounts and matters of fact. The bards and rhapsodists flourished for longafter the introduction of writing. They survived, indeed, in Europe as theminstrels into the Middle Ages.Unhappily their tradition had not the fixity of a written record. They amendedand reconstructed, they had their fashions and their phases of negligence.Accordingly we have now only the very much altered and revised vestiges of thatspoken literature of prehistoric times. One of the most interesting andinforming of these prehistoric compositions of the Aryans survives in the GreekIliad. An early form of Iliad was probably recited by 1000 BC, but it was notwritten down until perhaps 700 or 600 BC. Many men must have had to do with itas authors and improvers, but later Greek tradition attributed it to a blindbard named Homer, to whom also is ascribed the Odyssey, a composition of a verydifferent spirit and outlook. It is possible that many of the Aryan bards wereblind men. According to Professor J. L. Myres their bards were blinded toprevent their straying from the tribe. Mr. L. Lloyd has seen in Rhodesia themusician of a troupe of native dancers who had been blinded by his chief forthis very reason. The Slavs called all bards sliepac, which was also their wordfor a blind man. The original recited version of the Iliad was older than thatof the Odyssey. “The Iliad as a complete poem is older than the Odyssey, thoughthe material of the Odyssey, being largely undatable folklore, is older than anyof the historical material in the Iliad.” Both epics were probably written overand rewritten at a later date, in much the same manner that Lord Tennyson, thepoet laureate of Queen Victoria, in his Idylls of the King, wrote over the Morted’Arthur (which was itself a writing over by Sir Thomas Malory, circ. 1450, ofpre-existing legends), making the speeches and sentiments and the charactersmore in accordance with those of his own time. But the events of the Iliad andthe Odyssey, the way of living they describe, the spirit of the acts recorded,belong to the closing centuries of the prehistoric age. These sagas, epics, andvedas do supply, in addition to archæology and philology, a third source ofinformation about those vanished times.Here, for example, is the concluding passage of the Iliad, describing veryexactly the making of a prehistoric barrow. (We have taken here Chapman’s rhymedtranslation, correcting certain words with the help of the prose version ofLang, Leaf, and Myers).. . . Thus oxen, mules, in waggons straight they put, Went forth, and anunmeasur’d pile of sylvan matter cut; Nine days employ’d in carriage, but whenthe tenth morn shin’d On wretched mortals, then they brought the bravest of hiskind Forth to be burned. Troy swam in tears. Upon the pile’s most height Theylaid the body, and gave fire. All day it burn’d, all night. But when th’elev’nth morn let on earth her rosy fingers shine, The people flock’d about thepile, and first with gleaming wine Quench’d all the flames. His brothers then,and friends, the snowy bones Gathered into an urn of gold, still pouring outtheir moans. Then wrapt they in soft purple veils the rich urn, digg’d a pit,Grav’d it, built up the grave with stones, and quickly piled on it A barrow. . .. . . . The barrow heap’d once, all the town In Jove-nurs’d Priam’s Courtpartook a sumptuous fun’ral feast, And so horse-taming Hector’s rites gave uphis soul to rest.There remains also an old English saga, Beowulf, made long before the Englishhad crossed from Germany into England, which winds up with a similar burial. Thepreparation of a pyre is first described. It is hung round with shields andcoats of mail. The body is brought and the pyre fired, and then for ten days thewarriors built a mighty mound to be seen afar by the traveller on sea or land.Beowulf, which is at least a thousand years later than the Iliad, is alsointeresting because one of the main adventures in it is the looting of thetreasures of a barrow already ancient in those days.§ 3The Greek epics reveal the early Greeks with no knowledge of iron, withoutwriting, and before any Greek-founded cities existed in the land into which theyhad evidently come quite recently as conquerors. They were spreading southwardfrom the Aryan region of origin. They seem to have been a fair people, newcomersin Greece, newcomers to a land that had been held hitherto by the Mediterraneanor Iberian peoples.Let us, at the risk of a slight repetition, be perfectly clear upon one point.The Iliad does not give us the primitive neolithic life of that Aryan region oforigin; it gives us that life already well on the move towards a new state ofaffairs. The primitive neolithic way of living, with its tame and domesticatedanimals, its pottery and cooking, and its transitory patches of rudecultivation, we have already sketched. Between 15000 and 6000 BC the neolithicway of living had spread with the forests and abundant vegetation of the PluvialPeriod, over the greater part of the old world, from the Niger to the Hwanghoand from Ireland to the south of India. Now, as the climate of great portions ofthe earth was swinging towards drier and more open conditions again, theearlier, simpler, neolithic life was developing along two divergent directions.One was leading to a more wandering life, towards at last a constantly migratorylife between summer and winter pasture, which is called NOMADISM; the other, incertain sunlit river valleys, was towards a water-treasuring life of irrigation,in which men gathered into the first towns and made the first CIVILIZATION. Wehave already described the first civilizations and their liability to recurrentconquests by nomadic peoples. We have already noted that for many thousands ofyears there has been an almost rhythmic recurrence of conquest of thecivilizations by the nomads. Here we have to note that the Greeks, as the Iliadpresents them, are neither simple neolithic nomads, innocent of civilization,nor are they civilized men. They are nomads in an excited state, because theyhave just come upon civilization, and regard it as an opportunity for war andloot. From a platter ascribed to the end of the sev-enth century in the British Museum. This isprobably the earliest known vase bearing aGreek inscription. Greek writing was justbeginning. Note the Swastika.104 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_104_r1.gif]These early Greeks of the Iliad are sturdy fighters, but withoutdiscipline—their battles are a confusion of single combats. They have horses,but no cavalry; they use the horse, which is a comparatively recent addition toAryan resources, to drag a rude fighting chariot into battle. The horse is stillnovel enough to be something of a terror in itself. For ordinary draughtpurposes, as in the quotation from the Iliad we have just made, oxen wereemployed.105 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_105_r1.gif]The only priests of these Aryans are the keepers of shrines and sacred places.There are chiefs, who are heads of families and who also perform sacrifices, butthere does not seem to be much mystery or sacramental feeling in their religion.When the Greeks go to war, these heads and elders meet in council and appoint aking, whose powers are very loosely defined. There are no laws, but onlycustoms; and no exact standards of conduct.The social life of the early Greeks centred about the households of theseleading men. There were no doubt huts for herds and the like, and outlying farmbuildings; but the hall of the chief was a comprehensive centre, to whicheveryone went to feast, to hear the bards, to take part in games and exercises.The primitive craftsmen were gathered there. About it were cowsheds and stablingand such-like offices. Unimportant people slept about anywhere as retainers didin the mediæval castles and as people still do in Indian households. Except forquite personal possessions, there was still an air of patriarchal communismabout the tribe. The tribe, or the chief as the head of the tribe, owned thegrazing lands; forest and rivers were the wild.The Aryan social organization seems, and indeed all early communities seem, tohave been without the little separate households that make up the mass of thepopulation in western Europe or America today. The tribe was a big family; thenation a group of tribal families; a household often contained hundreds ofpeople. Human society began, just as herds and droves begin among animals, bythe family delaying its breaking up. Nowadays the lions in East Africa areapparently becoming social animals in this way, by the young keeping with themother after they are fully grown, and hunting in a group. Hitherto the lion hasbeen much more of a solitary beast. If men and women do not cling to theirfamilies nowadays as much as they did, it is because the state and the communitysupply now safety and help and facilities that were once only possible in thefamily group.In the Hindu community of today these great households of the earlier stages ofhuman society are still to be found. Mr. Bhupendranath Basu has recentlydescribed a typical Hindu household.4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77]It is an Aryan household refined and made gentle by thousands of years ofcivilization, but its social structure is the same as that of the households ofwhich the Aryan epics tell.“The joint family system,” he said, “has descended to us from time immemorial,the Aryan patriarchal system of old still holding sway in India. The structure,though ancient, remains full of life. The joint family is a cooperativecorporation, in which men and women have a well-defined place. At the head ofthe corporation is the senior member of the family, generally the eldest malemember, but in his absence the senior female member often assumes control.” (Cp.Penelope in the Odyssey).All able-bodied members must contribute their labour and earnings, whether ofpersonal skill or agriculture and trade, to the common stock; weaker members,widows, orphans, and destitute relations, all must be maintained and supported;sons, nephews, brothers, cousins, all must be treated equally, for any unduepreference is apt to break up the family. We have no word for cousins—they areeither brothers or sisters, and we do not know what are cousins two degreesremoved. The children of a first cousin are your nephews and nieces, just thesame as the children of your brothers and sisters. A man can no more marry acousin, however removed, than he can marry his own sister, except in certainparts of Madras, where a man may marry his maternal uncle’s daughter. The familyaffections, the family ties, are always very strong, and therefore themaintenance of an equal standard among so many members is not so difficult as itmay appear at first sight. Moreover, life is very simple. Until recently shoeswere not in general use at home, but sandals without any leather fastenings. Ihave known of a well-to-do middle-class family of several brothers and cousinswho had two or three pairs of leather shoes between them, these shoes being onlyused when they had occasion to go out, and the same practice is still followedin the case of the more expensive garments, like shawls, which last forgenerations, and with their age are treated with loving care, as having beenused by ancestors of revered memory.The joint family remains together sometimes for several generations, until itbecomes too unwieldy, when it breaks up into smaller families, and you thus seewhole villages peopled by members of the same clan. I have said that the familyis a cooperative society, and it may be likened to a small state, and is kept inits place by strong discipline based on love and obedience. You see nearlyeveryday the younger members coming to the head of the family and taking thedust of his feet as a token of benediction; whenever they go on an enterprise,they take his leave and carry his blessing. . . . There are many bonds whichbind the family together—the bonds of sympathy, of common pleasures, of commonsorrows; when a death occurs, all the members go into mourning; when there is abirth or a wedding, the whole family rejoices. Then above all is the familydeity, some image of Vishnu, the preserver; his place is in a separate room,generally known as the room of God, or in well-to-do families in a templeattached to the house, where the family performs its daily worship. There is asense of personal attachment between this image of the deity and the family, forthe image generally comes down from past generations, often miraculouslyacquired by a pious ancestor at some remote time. . . . With the household godsis intimately associated the family priest. . . . The Hindu priest is a part ofthe family life of his flock, between whom and himself the tie has existed formany generations. The priest is not generally a man of much learning; he knows,however, the traditions of his faith. . . . He is not a very heavy burden, forhe is satisfied with little—a few handfuls of rice, a few home-grown bananas orvegetables, a little unrefined sugar made in the village, and sometimes a fewpieces of copper are all that is needed. . . . A picture of our family lifewould be incomplete without the household servants. A female servant is known asthe “jhi,” or daughter, in Bengal—she is like the daughter of the house; shecalls the master and the mistress father and mother, and the young men and womenof the family brothers and sisters. She participates in the life of the family;she goes to the holy places along with her mistress, for she could not go alone,and generally she spends her life with the family of her adoption; her childrenare looked after by the family. The treatment of men servants is very similar.These servants, men and women, are generally people of the humbler castes, but asense of personal attachment grows up between them and the members of thefamily, and as they get on in years they are affectionately called by theyounger members elder brothers, uncles, aunts, etc. . . . In a well-to-do housethere is always a resident teacher, who instructs the children of the family aswell as other boys of the village; there is no expensive school building, butroom is found in some veranda or shed in the courtyard for the children andtheir teacher, and into this school low-caste boys are freely admitted. Theseindigenous schools were not of a very high order, but they supplied an agency ofinstruction for the masses which was probably not available in many othercountries. . . .With Hindu life is bound up its traditional duty of hospitality. It is the dutyof a householder to offer a meal to any stranger who may come before midday andask for one; the mistress of the house does not sit down to her meal until everymember is fed, and, as sometimes her food is all that is left, she does not takeher meal until well after midday lest a hungry stranger should come and claimone. . . .We have been tempted to quote Mr. Basu at some length, because here we do get tosomething like a living understanding of the type of household which hasprevailed in human communities since Neolithic days, which still prevails todayin India, China, and the Far East, but which in the west is rapidly givingground before a state and municipal organization of education and a large-scaleindustrialism within which an amount of individual detachment and freedom ispossible, such as these great households never knew. . . .But let us return now to the history preserved for us in the Aryan epics.The Sanscrit epics tell a very similar story to that under lying the Iliad, thestory of a fair, beef-eating people—only later did they becomevegetarians—coming down from Persia into the plain of North India and conqueringtheir way slowly towards the Indus. From the Indus they spread over India, butas they spread they acquired much from the dark Dravidians they conquered, andthey seem to have lost their bardic tradition. The vedas, says Mr. Basu, weretransmitted chiefly in the households by the women. . . .The oral literature of the Keltic peoples who pressed westward has not beenpreserved so completely as that of the Greeks or Indians; it was written downmany centuries later, and so, like the barbaric, primitive English Beowulf, haslost any clear evidence of a period of migration into the lands of an antecedentpeople. If the pre-Aryans figure in it at all, it is as the fairy folk of theIrish stories. Ireland, most cut off of all the Keltic-speaking communities,retained to the latest date its primitive life; and the Táin, the Irish Iliad,describes a cattle-keeping life in which war chariots are still used, and wardogs also, and the heads of the slain are carried off slung round the horses’necks. The Táin is the story of a cattle raid. Here, too, the same social orderappears as in the Iliad; the chiefs sit and feast in great halls, they buildhalls for themselves, there is singing and storytelling by the bards, anddrinking and intoxication. Priests are not very much in evidence, but there is asort of medicine-man who deals in spells and prophecy."},{"pageContent":"106 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_106_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 107[bano_9781411428843_oeb_107_r1.gif]THE GREEKS AND THE PERSIANS§ 1.

They probably came insuccessive waves. Three main variations of the ancient Greek speech aredistinguished: the Ionic, the Æolic, and the Doric. There was a great variety ofdialects. The Ionians seem to have preceded the other Greeks, and to have mixedvery intimately with the civilized peoples they overwhelmed. Racially the peopleof such cities as Athens and Miletus may have been less Nordic thanMediterranean. The Doric apparently constituted the last most powerful and leastcivilized wave of the migration. These Hellenic tribes conquered and largelydestroyed the Ægean civilization that had preceded their arrival; upon its ashesthey built up a civilization of their own. They took to the sea and crossed byway of the islands to Asia Minor; and, sailing through the Dardanelles andBosphorus, spread their settlements along the south, and presently along thenorth borders of the Black Sea. They spread also over the south of Italy, whichwas called at last Magna Græcia, and round the northern coast of theMediterranean. They founded the town of Marseilles on the site of an earlierPhœnician colony. They began settlements in Sicily in rivalry with theCarthaginians as early as 735 BC.108 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_108_r1.gif]In the rear of the Greeks proper came the kindred Macedonians and Thracians; ontheir left wing, the Phrygians crossed by the Bosphorus into Asia Minor.109 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_109_r1.gif]We find all this distribution of the Greeks effected before the beginnings ofwritten history. By the seventh century BC—that is to say, by the time of theBabylonian captivity of the Jews—the landmarks of the ancient world of thepre-Hellenic civilization in Europe have been obliterated. Tiryns and Cnossosare unimportant sites; Mycenæ and Troy survive in legend; the great cities ofthis new Greek world are Athens, Sparta (the capital of Lacedemon), Corinth,Thebes, Samos, Miletus. The world our grandfathers called “Ancient Greece” hadarisen on the forgotten ruins of a still more Ancient Greece, in many ways ascivilized and artistic, of which today we are only beginning to learn throughthe labours of the excavator. But the newer Ancient Greece, of which we are nowtelling, still lives vividly in the imaginations and institutions of men becauseit spoke a beautiful and most expressive Aryan tongue akin to our own, andbecause it had taken over the Mediterranean alphabet and perfected it by theaddition of vowels, so that reading and writing were now easy arts to learn andpractise, and great numbers of people could master them and make a record forlater ages.1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en78]§ 2Now this Greek civilization that we find growing up in South Italy and Greeceand Asia Minor in the seventh century BC, is a civilization differing in manyimportant respects from the two great civilized systems whose growths we havealready traced, that of the Nile and that of the Two Rivers of Mesopotamia.These civilizations grew through long ages where they are found; they grewslowly about a temple life out of a primitive agriculture; priest-kings andgod-kings consolidated such early city states into empires. But the barbaricGreek herdsmen raiders came southward into a world whose civilization wasalready an old story. Shipping and agriculture, walled cities and writing werealready there. The Greeks did not grow a civilization of their own; they wreckedone and put another together upon and out of the ruins.To this we must ascribe the fact that there is no temple-state stage, no stageof priest-kings, in the Greek record. The Greeks got at once to the cityorganization that in the east had grown round the temple. They took over theassociation of temple and city; the idea was readymade for them. What impressedthem most about the city was probably its wall. It is doubtful if they took tocity life and citizenship straight away. At first they lived in open villagesoutside the ruins of the cities they had destroyed, but there stood the modelfor them, a continual suggestion. They thought first of a city as a safe placein a time of strife, and of the temple uncritically as a proper feature of thecity. They came into this inheritance of a previous civilization with the ideasand traditions of the woodlands still strong in their minds. The heroic socialsystem of the Iliad took possession of the land, and adapted itself to the newconditions. As history goes on the Greeks became more religious andsuperstitious as the faiths of the conquered welled up from below.We have already said that the social structure of the primitive Aryans was atwo-class system of nobles and commoners, the classes not very sharply markedoff from each other, and led in warfare by a king who was simply the head of oneof the noble families, primus inter pares, a leader among his equals. With theconquest of the aboriginal population and with the building of towns there wasadded to this simple social arrangement of two classes a lower stratum offarm-workers and skilled and unskilled workers, who were for the most partslaves. But all the Greek communities were not of this “conquest” type. Somewere “refugee” cities representing smashed communities, and in these theaboriginal substratum would be missing.In many of the former cases the survivors of the earlier population formed asubject class, slaves of the state as a whole, as, for instance, the Helots inSparta. The nobles and commoners became landlords and gentlemen farmers; it wasthey who directed the shipbuilding and engaged in trade. But some of the poorerfree citizens followed mechanic arts, and, as we have already noted, would evenpull an oar in a galley for pay. Such priests as there were in this Greek worldwere either the guardians of shrines and temples or sacrificial functionaries;Aristotle, in his Politics, makes them a mere subdivision of his official class.The citizen served as warrior in youth, ruler in his maturity, priest in his oldage. The priestly class, in comparison with the equivalent class in Egypt andBabylonia, was small and insignificant. The gods of the Greeks proper, the godsof the heroic Greeks, were, as we have already noted, glorified human beings,and they were treated without very much fear or awe; but beneath these gods ofthe conquering freemen lurked other gods of the subjugated peoples, who foundtheir furtive followers among slaves and women. The original Aryan gods were notexpected to work miracles or control men’s lives. But Greece, like most of theEastern world in the thousand years BC, was much addicted to consulting oraclesor soothsayers. Delphi was particularly famous for its oracle. “When the OldestMen in the tribe could not tell you the right thing to do,” says Gilbert Murray,“you went to the blessed dead. All oracles were at the tombs of Heroes. Theytold you what was ‘Themis,’ what was the right thing to do, or, as religiouspeople would put it now, what was the Will of the God.”The priests and priestesses of these temples were not united into one class, nordid they exercise any power as a class. It was the nobles and free commoners,two classes which, in some cases, merged into one common body of citizens, whoconstituted the Greek state. In many cases, especially in great city states, thepopulation of slaves and unenfranchised strangers greatly outnumbered thecitizens. But for them the state existed only by courtesy; it existed legallyfor the select body of citizens alone. It might or might not tolerate theoutsider and the slave, but they had no legal voice in their treatment—anymorethan if it had been a despotism.110 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_110_r1.gif]This is a social structure differing widely from that of the Eastern monarchies.The exclusive importance of the Greek citizen reminds one a little of theexclusive importance of the children of Israel in the later Jewish state, butthere is no equivalent on the Greek side to the prophets and priests, nor to theidea of an overruling Jehovah.Another contrast between the Greek states and any of the human communities towhich we have hitherto given attention is their continuous and incurabledivision. The civilizations of Egypt, Sumeria, China, and no doubt North India,all began in a number of independent city states, each one a city with a fewmiles of dependent agricultural villages and cultivation around it, but out ofthis phase they passed by a process of coalescence into kingdoms and empires.But to the very end of their independent history the Greeks did not coalesce.Commonly, this is ascribed to the geographical conditions under which theylived. Greece is a country cut up into a multitude of valleys by mountain massesand arms of the sea that render intercommunication difficult; so difficult thatfew cities were able to hold many of the others in subjection for any length oftime. Moreover, many Greek cities were on islands and scattered along remotecoasts. To the end the largest city states of Greece remained smaller than manyEnglish counties; and some had an area of only a few square miles. Athens, oneof the largest of the Greek cities, at the climax of its power had a populationof perhaps a third of a million. Few other Greek cities exceeded fifty thousand.Of this, half or more were slaves and strangers, and two-thirds of the free bodywomen and children.§ 3The government of these city states varied very widely in its nature. As theysettled down after their conquests the Greeks retained for a time the rule oftheir kings, but these kingdoms drifted back more and more to the rule of thearistocratic class. In Sparta (Lacedemon) kings were still distinguished in thesixth century BC. The Lacedemonians had a curious system of a double kingship;two kings, drawn from different royal families, ruled together. But most of theGreek city states had become aristocratic republics long before the sixthcentury. There is, however, a tendency towards slackness and inefficiency inmost families that rule by hereditary right; sooner or later they decline; andas the Greeks got out upon the seas and set up colonies and commerce extended,new rich families arose to jostle the old and bring new personalities intopower. These nouveaux riches became members of an expanded ruling class, a modeof government known as oligarchy—in opposition to aristocracy—though, strictly,the term oligarchy (= government by the few) should of course include hereditaryaristocracy as a special case.In many cities persons of exceptional energy, taking advantage of some socialconflict or class grievance, secured a more or less irregular power in thestate. This combination of personality and opportunity has occurred in theUnited States of America, for example, where men exercising various kinds ofinformal power are called bosses. In Greece they were called tyrants. But thetyrant was rather more than a boss; he was recognized as a monarch, and claimedthe authority of a monarch. The modern boss, on the other hand, shelters behindlegal forms which he has “got hold of” and uses for his own ends. Tyrants weredistinguished from kings, who claimed some sort of right, some family priority,for example, to rule. They were supported, perhaps, by the poorer class with agrievance; Peisistratus, for example, who was tyrant of Athens, with twointervals of exile, between 560 and 527 BC, was supported by the poverty-struckAthenian hillmen. Sometimes, as in Greek Sicily, the tyrant stood for the richagainst the poor. When, later on, the Persians began to subjugate the Greekcities of Asia Minor, they set up pro-Persian tyrants.Aristotle, the great philosophical teacher, who was born under the hereditaryMacedonian monarchy, and who was for some years tutor to the king’s son,distinguishes in his Politics between kings who ruled by an admitted andinherent right, such as the King of Macedonia, whom he served, and tyrants whoruled without the consent of the governed. As a matter of fact, it is hard toconceive of a tyrant ruling without the consent of many, and the activeparticipation of a substantial number of his subjects; and the devotion andunselfishness of your “true kings” has been known to rouse resentment andquestioning. Aristotle was also able to say that while the king ruled for thegood of the state, the tyrant ruled for his own good. Upon this point, as in hisability to regard slavery as a natural thing and to consider women unfit forfreedom and political rights, Aristotle was in harmony with the trend of eventsabout him.A third form of government that prevailed increasingly in Greece in the sixth,fifth, and fourth centuries BC, was known as democracy. As the modern worldnowadays is constantly talking of democracy, and as the modern idea of democracyis something widely different from the democracy of the Greek city states, itwill be well to be very explicit upon the meaning of democracy in Greece.Democracy then was government by the commonalty, the Demos; it was government bythe whole body of the citizens, by the many as distinguished from the few. Butlet the modern reader mark that word “citizen.” The slave was excluded, thefreedman was excluded, the stranger; even the Greek born in the city, whosefather had come eight or ten miles from the city beyond the headland, wasexcluded. The earlier democracies (but not all) demanded a propertyqualification from the citizen, and property in those days was land; this wassubsequently relaxed, but the modern reader will grasp that here was somethingvery different from modern democracy. At the end of the fifth century BC thisproperty qualification had been abolished in Athens, for example; but Pericles,a great Athenian statesman of whom we shall have more to tell later, hadestablished a law (451 BC) restricting citizenship to those who could establishAthenian descent on both sides. Thus, in the Greek democracies quite as much asin the oligarchies, the citizens formed a close corporation, ruling sometimes,as in the case of Athens in its great days, a big population of serfs, slaves,and “outlanders.” A modern politician used to the idea, the entirely new anddifferent idea, that democracy in its perfected form means that every adult manand woman shall have a voice in the government, would, if suddenly spirited backto the extremist Greek democracy, regard it as a kind of oligarchy. The onlyreal difference between a Greek “oligarchy” and a Greek democracy was that inthe former the poorer and less important citizens had no voice in thegovernment, and in the latter every citizen had. Aristotle, in his Politics,betrays very clearly the practical outcome of this difference. Taxation setlightly on the rich in the oligarchies; the democracies, on the other hand,taxed the rich, and generally paid the impecunious citizen a maintenanceallowance and special fees. In Athens fees were paid to citizens even forattending the general assembly. But the generality of people outside the happyorder of citizens worked and did what they were told, and if one desired theprotection of the law, one sought a citizen to plead for one. For only thecitizen had any standing in the law courts. The modern idea, that anyone in thestate should be a citizen, would have shocked the privileged democrats of Athensprofoundly.One obvious result of this monopolization of the state by the class of citizenswas that the patriotism of these privileged people took an intense and narrowform. They would form alliances, but never coalesce with other city states. Thatwould have obliterated every advantage by which they lived. The narrowgeographical limits of these Greek states added to the intensity of theirfeeling. A man’s love for his country was reinforced by his love for his nativetown, his religion, and his home; for these were all one. Of course the slavesdid not share in these feelings, and in the oligarchic states very often theexcluded class got over its dislike of foreigners in its greater dislike of theclass at home which oppressed it. But in the main, patriotism in the Greek was apersonal passion of an inspiring and dangerous intensity. Like rejected love, itwas apt to turn into something very like hatred. The Greek exile resembled theFrench or Russian émigré in being ready to treat his beloved country prettyroughly in order to save her from the devils in human form who had takenpossession of her and turned him out.In the fifth century BC Athens formed a system of relationships with a number ofother Greek city states which is often spoken of by historians as the AthenianEmpire. But all the other city states retained their own governments. One “newfact” added by the Athenian Empire was the complete and effective suppression ofpiracy; another was the institution, of a sort of international law. The lawindeed was Athenian law; but actions could now be brought and justiceadministered between citizens of the different states of the League, which ofcourse had not been possible before. The Athenian Empire had really developedout of a league of mutual defence against Persia; its seat had originally beenin the island of Delos, and the allies had contributed to a common treasure atDelos; the treasure of Delos was carried off to Athens because it was exposed toa possible Persian raid. Then one city after another offered a monetarycontribution instead of military service, with the result that in the end Athenswas doing almost all the work and receiving almost all the money. She wassupported by one or two of the larger islands. The “League” in this way becamegradually an “Empire,” but the citizens of the allied states remained, exceptwhere there were special treaties of intermarriage and the like, practicallyforeigners to one another. And it was chiefly the poorer citizens of Athens whosustained this empire by their most vigorous and incessant personal service.Every citizen was liable to military service at home or abroad between the agesof eighteen and sixty, sometimes on purely Athenian affairs and sometimes indefence of the cities of the Empire whose citizens had bought themselves off.There was probably no single man over twenty-five in the Athenian Assembly whohad not served in several campaigns in different parts of the Mediterranean orBlack Sea, and who did not expect to serve again. Modern imperialism isdenounced by its opponents as the exploitation of the world by the rich;Athenian imperialism was the exploitation of the world by the poorer citizens ofAthens.Another difference from modern conditions, due to the small size of the Greekcity states, was that in a democracy every citizen had the right to attend andspeak and vote in the popular assembly. For most cities this meant a gatheringof only a few hundred people; the greatest had no more than some thousands ofcitizens. Nothing of this sort is possible in a modern “democracy” with,perhaps, several million voters. The modern “citizen’s” voice in public affairsis limited to the right to vote for one or other of the party candidates putbefore him. He, or she, is then supposed to have “assented” to the resultantgovernment. Aristotle, who would have enjoyed the electoral methods of ourmodern democracies keenly, points out very subtly how the outlying farmer classof citizens in a democracy can be virtually disenfranchised by calling thepopular assembly too frequently for their regular attendance. In the later Greekdemocracies (fifth century) the appointment of public officials, except in thecase of officers requiring very special knowledge, was by casting lots. This wassupposed to protect the general corporation of privileged citizens from thecontinued predominance of rich, influential, and conspicuously able men.Some democracies (Athens and Miletus, e.g.) had an institution called the“ostracism,”2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en79] by which in times ofcrisis and conflict the decision was made whether some citizen should go intoexile for ten years. This may strike a modern reader as an envious institution,but that was not its essential quality. It was, says Gilbert Murray, a way ofarriving at a decision in a case when political feeling was so divided as tothreaten a deadlock. There were in the Greek democracies parties and partyleaders, but no regular government in office and no regular opposition. Therewas no way, therefore, of carrying out a policy, although it might be thepopular policy, if a strong leader or a strong group stood out against it. Butby the ostracism, the least popular or the least trusted of the chief leaders inthe divided community was made to retire for a period without loss of honour orproperty. Professor Murray suggests that a Greek democracy, if it had founditself in such a position of deadlock as the British Empire did upon thequestion of Home Rule for Ireland in 1914, would have probably first ostracizedSir Edward Carson, and then proceeded to carry out the provisions of the HomeRule Bill.This institution of the ostracism has immortalized one obscure and ratherilliterate member of the democracy of Athens. A certain Aristides had gained agreat reputation in the law court for his righteous dealing. He fell into adispute with Themistocles upon a question of naval policy; Aristides was for thearmy, Themistocles was a “strong navy” man, and a deadlock was threatened. Therewas resort to an ostracism to decide between them. Plutarch relates that asAristides walked through the streets while the voting was in progress, he wasaccosted by a strange citizen from the agricultural environs unaccustomed to theart of writing, and requested to write his own name on the proffered potsherd.“But why?” he asked. “Has Aristides ever injured you?”“No,” said the citizen. “No. Never have I set eyes on him. But, oh! I am sobored by hearing him called Aristides the Just.”Whereupon, says Plutarch, without further parley Aristides wrote as the mandesired. . . .When one understands the true meaning of these Greek constitutions, and inparticular the limitation of all power, whether in the democracies or theoligarchies, to a locally privileged class, one realizes how impossible was anyeffective union of the hundreds of Greek cities scattered about theMediterranean region, or even of any effective cooperation between them for acommon end. Each city was in the hands of a few or a few hundred men, to whomits separateness meant everything that was worth having in life. Only conquestfrom the outside could unite the Greeks, and until Greece was conquered they hadno political unity. When at last they were conquered, they were conquered socompletely that their unity ceased to be of any importance even to themselves;it was a unity of subjugation.Yet there was always a certain tradition of unity between all the Greeks, basedon a common language and script, on the common possession of the heroic epics,and on the continuous intercourse that the maritime position of the states madepossible. And in addition, there were certain religious bonds of a unifyingkind. Certain shrines, the shrines of the god Apollo in the island of Delos andat Delphi, for example, were sustained not by single states, but by leagues ofstates or Amphictyonies (= League of neighbours), which in such instances as theDelphic amphictyony became very wide-reaching unions. The league protected theshrine and the safety of pilgrims, kept up the roads leading thereunto, securedpeace at the time of special festivals, upheld certain rules to mitigate theusages of war among its members, and—the Delian league especially—suppressedpiracy. A still more important link of Hellenic union was the Olympian gamesthat were held every four years at Olympia. Foot races, boxing, wrestling,javelin throwing, quoit throwing, jumping, and chariot and horse racing were thechief sports, and a record of victors and distinguished visitors was kept. Fromthe year 776 BC onward3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en80] these gameswere held regularly for over a thousand years, and they did much to maintainthat sense of a common Greek life (pan-Hellenic) transcending the narrowpolitics of the city states.Such links of sentiment and association were of little avail against the intense“separatism” of the Greek political institutions. From the History of Herodotusthe student will be able to gather a sense of the intensity and persistence ofthe feuds that kept the Greek world in a state of chronic warfare. In the olddays (say, to the sixth century BC) fairly large families prevailed in Greece,and something of the old Aryan great household system (see Chap. XX), with itsstrong clan feeling and its capacity for maintaining an enduring feud, stillremained. The history of Athens circles for many years about the feud of twogreat families, the Alcmæonidæ and the Peisistratidæ; the latter equally anaristocratic family, but founding its power on the support of the poorer classof the populace and the exploitation of their grievances. Later on, in the sixthand fifth centuries, a limitation of births and a shrinkage of families to twoor three members—a process Aristotle notes without perceiving its cause—led tothe disappearance of the old aristocratic clans, and the later wars were duerather to trade disputes and grievances caused and stirred up by individualadventurers than to family vendettas.It is easy to understand, in view of this intense separatism of the Greeks, howreadily the Ionians of Asia and of the islands fell first under the dominationof the kingdom of Lydia, and then under that of the Persians when Cyrusoverthrew Crœsus, the king of Lydia. They rebelled only to be reconquered. Thencame the turn of European Greece. It is a matter of astonishment, the Greeksthemselves were astonished, to find that Greece itself did not fall under thedominion of the Persians, these barbaric Aryan masters of the ancientcivilizations of Western Asia. But before we tell of this struggle we must givesome attention to these Asiatics against whom they were pitted; and particularlyto these Medes and Persians who, by 538 BC, were already in possession of theancient civilizations of Assyria, Babylonia and about to subjugate Egypt.§ 4We have had occasion to mention the kingdom of Lydia, and it may be well to givea short note here upon the Lydians before proceeding with our story. Theoriginal population of the larger part of Asia Minor may perhaps have been akinto the original population of Greece and Crete. If so, it was of “Mediterranean”race. Or it may have been another branch of those still more generalized andfundamental darkish peoples from whom arose the Mediterranean race to the westand the Dravidians to the east. Remains of the same sort of art thatdistinguishes Cnossos and Mycenæ are to be found scattered over Asia Minor. Butjust as the Nordic Greeks poured southward into Greece to conquer and mix withthe aborigines, so did other and kindred Nordic tribes pour over the Bosphorusinto Asia Minor. Over some areas these Aryan peoples prevailed altogether, andbecame the bulk of the inhabitants and retained their Aryan speech. Such werethe Phrygians, a people whose language was almost as close to that of the Greeksas the Macedonian. But over other areas the Aryans did not so prevail. In Lydiathe original race and their language held their own. The Lydians were anon-Aryan people speaking a non-Aryan speech, of which at the present time onlya few words are known. Their capital city was Sardis.Their religion was also non-Aryan. They worshipped a Great Mother goddess. ThePhrygians also, though retaining their Greek-like language, became infected withmysterious religion, and much of the mystical religion and secret ceremonialthat pervaded Athens at a later date was Phrygian (when not Thracian) in origin.At first the Lydians held the western seacoast of Asia Minor, but they weredriven back from it by the establishment of Ionian Greeks coming by the sea andfounding cities. Later on, however, these Ionian Greek cities were brought intosubjection by the Lydian kings.The history of this country is not clearly known, and were it known it wouldscarcely be of sufficient importance to be related in this historical outline,but in the eighth century BC one monarch, named Gyges, becomes noteworthy. Thecountry under his rule was subjected to another Aryan invasion; certain nomadictribes called the “Cimmerians” came pouring across Asia Minor, and they weredriven back with difficulty by Gyges and his son and grandson. Sardis was twicetaken and burnt by these barbarians. And it is on record that Gyges paid tributeto Sardanapalus, which serves to link him up with our general ideas of thehistory of Assyria, Israel, and Egypt. Later Gyges rebelled against Assyria, andsent troops to help Psammetichus I to liberate Egypt from its brief servitude tothe Assyrians.It was Alyattes, the grandson of Gyges, who made Lydia into a considerablepower. He reigned for seven years, and he reduced most of the Ionian cities ofAsia Minor to subjection. The country became the centre of a great trade betweenAsia and Europe; it had always been productive and rich in gold, and now theLydian monarch was reputed the richest in Asia. There was a great coming andgoing between the Black and Mediterranean Seas, and between the East and West.We have already noted that Lydia was reputed to be the first country in theworld to produce coined money, and to provide the convenience of inns fortravellers and traders. The Lydian dynasty seems to have been a trading dynastyof the type of Minos in Crete, with a banking and financial development. . . .So much we may note of Lydia by way of preface to the next section.§ 5Now while one series of Aryan-speaking invaders had developed along the lines wehave described in Greece, Magna Græcia, and around the shores of the Black Sea,another series of Aryan-speaking peoples, whose originally Nordic blood wasperhaps already mixed with a Mongolian element, were settling and spreading tothe north and east of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires. We have alreadyspoken of the arc-like dispersion of the Nordic Aryan peoples to the north ofthe Black and Caspian Seas; it was probably by this route that theAryan-speaking races gradually came down into what is now the Persian country,and spread, on the one hand, eastward to India (? 2000 to 1000 BC), and on theother, increased and multiplied in the Persian uplands until they were strongenough to assail first Assyria (650 BC) and then Babylon (538 BC).There is much that is not yet clear about the changes of climate that have beengoing on in Europe and Asia during the last 10,000 years. The ice of the lastglacial age receded gradually, and gave way to a long period of steppe orprairie-like conditions over the great plain of Europe. About 12,000 or 10,000years ago, as it is reckoned now, this state of affairs was giving place toforest conditions. We have already noted how, as a consequence of these changes,the Solutrian horse hunters gave place to Magdalenian fishers and forest deerhunters; and these, again, to the Neolithic herdsmen and agriculturists. Forsome thousands of years the European climate seems to have been warmer than itis today. A great sea spread from the coast of the Balkan peninsula far intoCentral Asia and extended northward into Central Russia, and the shrinkage ofthat sea and the consequent hardening of the climate of South Russia and CentralAsia was going on contemporaneously with the development of the firstcivilizations in the river valleys. Many facts seem to point to a more genialclimate in Europe and Western Asia, and still more strongly to a greaterluxuriance of plant and vegetable life, 4,000 to 3,000 years ago, than we findtoday. There were forests then in South Russia and in the country which is nowWestern Turkestan, where now steppes and deserts prevail. On the other hand,between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago, the Aral-Caspian region was probably drierand those seas smaller than they are at the present time.We may note in this connection that Thotmes III (say, the fifteenth century BC),in his expedition beyond the Euphrates, hunted a herd of 120 elephants in thatregion. Again, an Ægean dagger from Mycenæ, dating about 2000 BC, shows alion-hunt in progress. The hunters carry big shields and spears, and stand inrows one behind the other. The first man spears the lion, and when the woundedbeast leaps at him, drops flat under the protection of his big shield, leavingthe next man to repeat his stroke, and so on, until the lion is speared todeath. This method of hunting is practised by the Masai today, and could onlyhave been worked out by a people in a land where lions were abundant. Butabundant lions imply abundant game, and that again means abundant vegetation.About 2000 BC the hardening of the climate in the central parts of the OldWorld, to which we have already referred, which put an end to elephants andlions in Asia Minor and Greece,4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en81] wasturning the faces of the nomadic Aryan peoples southward towards the fields andforests of the more settled and civilized nations.These Aryan peoples come down from the East Caspian regions into history aboutthe time that Mycenæ and Troy and Cnossos are falling to the Greeks. It isdifficult to disentangle the different tribes and races that appear under amultitude of names in the records and inscriptions that record their firstappearance, but, fortunately, these distinctions are not needed in an elementaryoutline such as this present history. A people called the Cimmerians appear inthe districts of Lake Urumiya and Van, and shortly after Aryans have spread fromArmenia to Elam. In the ninth century BC, a people called the Medes, veryclosely related to the Persians to the east of them, appear in the Assyrianinscriptions. Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II, names already familiar in thisstory, profess to have made them pay tribute. They are spoken of in theinscriptions as the “dangerous Medes.” They are as yet a tribal people, notunited under one king.About the ninth century BC Elam and the Elamites, whose capital was Susa, apeople which possessed a tradition and civilization at least as old as theSumerian, suddenly vanish from history. We do not know what happened. They seemto have been overrun and the population absorbed by the conquerors. Susa is inthe hands of the Persians.111 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_111_r1.gif]A fourth people, related to these Aryan tribes, who appear at this time in thenarrative of Herodotus, are the “Scythians.” For a while the monarchs of Assyriaplay off these various kindred peoples, the Cimmerians, the Medes, the Persians,and the Scythians, against each other. Assyrian princesses (a daughter ofEsarhaddon e.g.,) are married to Scythian chiefs. Nebuchadnezzar the Great, onthe other hand, marries a daughter of Cyaxares, who has become king of all theMedes. The Aryan Scythians are for the Semitic Assyrians; the Aryan Medes forthe Semitic Babylonians. It was this Cyaxares who took Nineveh, the Assyriancapital, in 606 BC, and so released Babylon from the Assyrian yoke to establish,under Chaldean rule, the Second Babylonian Empire. The Scythian allies ofAssyria drop out of the story after this. They go on living their own life awayto the north without much interference with the peoples to the south. A glanceat the map of this period shows how, for two-thirds of a century, the SecondBabylonian Empire lay like a lamb within the embrace of the Median lion.Into the internal struggles of the Medes and Persians, that ended at last in theaccession of Cyrus “the Persian” to the throne of Cyaxares in 550 BC, we willnot enter. In that year Cyrus was ruling over an empire that reached from theboundaries of Lydia to Persia and perhaps to India. Nabonidus, the last of theBabylonian rulers, was, as we have already told, digging up old records andbuilding temples in Babylonia.§ 6But one monarch in the world was alive to the threat of the new power that layin the hands of Cyrus. This was Crœsus, the Lydian king. His son had been killedin a very tragic manner, which Herodotus relates, but which we will not describehere. Says Herodotus:“For two years then, Crœsus remained quiet in great mourning, because he wasdeprived of his son; but after this period of time, the overthrowing of the ruleof the son of Cyaxares by Cyrus, and the growing greatness of the Persians,caused Crœsus to cease from his mourning, and led him to a care of cutting shortthe power of the Persians if by any means he might, while yet it was in growthand before they should have become great.”He then made trial of the various oracles.112 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_112_r1.gif]To the Lydians who were to carry these gifts to the temples Crœsus gave chargethat they should ask the Oracles this question: whether Crœsus should marchagainst the Persians, and, if so, whether he should join with himself any armyof men as his friends. And when the Lydians had arrived at the places to whichthey had been sent and had dedicated the votive offerings, they inquired of theOracles, and said: “Crœsus, king of the Lydians and of other nations,considering that these are the only true Oracles among men, presents to yougifts such as your revelations deserve, and asks you again now whether he shallmarch against the Persians, and, if so, whether he shall join with himself anyarmy of men as allies.” They inquired thus, and the answers of both the Oraclesagreed in one, declaring to Crœsus that if he should march against the Persianshe should destroy a great empire. . . . So when the answers were brought backand Crœsus heard them, he was delighted with the Oracles, and expecting that hewould certainly destroy the kingdom of Cyrus, he sent again to Pytho, andpresented to the men of Delphi, having ascertained the number of them, twostaters of gold for each man: and in return for this the Delphians gave toCrœsus and to the Lydians precedence in consulting the Oracle and freedom fromall payments, and the right to front seats at the games, with this privilegealso for all time, that anyone of them who wished should be allowed to become acitizen of Delphi.So Crœsus made a defensive alliance both with the Lacedemonians and theEgyptians. And Herodotus continues,. . . while Crœsus was preparing to march against the Persians, one of theLydians, who even before this time was thought to be a wise man, but inconsequence of this opinion got a very great name for wisdom among the Lydians,advised Crœsus as follows: “O king, thou art preparing to march against men whowear breeches of leather, and the rest of their clothing is of leather also; andthey eat food not such as they desire, but such as they can obtain, dwelling ina land which is rugged; and, moreover, they make no use of wine but drink water;and no figs have they for dessert, nor any other good thing. On the one hand, ifthou shalt overcome them, what wilt thou take away from them, seeing they havenothing? And, on the other hand, if thou shalt be overcome, consider how manygood things thou wilt lose; for once having tasted our good things, they willcling to them fast, and it will not be possible to drive them away. I, for myown part, feel gratitude to the gods that they do not put it into the minds ofthe Persians to march against the Lydians.” Thus he spoke not persuading Crœsus;for it is true indeed that the Persians before they subdued the Lydians had noluxury nor any good thing.”Crœsus and Cyrus fought an indecisive battle at Pteria, from which Crœsusretreated. Cyrus followed him up, and he gave battle outside his capital town ofSardis. The chief strength of the Lydians lay in their cavalry; they wereexcellent, if undisciplined, horsemen, and fought with long spears.Cyrus, when he saw the Lydians being arrayed for battle, fearing their horsemen,did on the suggestion of Harpagos, a Mede, as follows: All the camels which werein the train of his army carrying provisions and baggage he gathered togetherand he took off their burdens and set men upon them provided with the equipmentof cavalry; and, having thus furnished them, forth he appointed them to go infront of the rest of the army towards the horsemen of Crœsus; and after thecamel-troop he ordered the infantry to follow; and behind the infantry he placedhis whole force of cavalry. Then, when all his men had been placed in theirseveral positions, he charged them to spare none of the other Lydians, slayingall who might come in their way, but Crœsus himself they were not to slay, noteven if he should make resistance when he was being captured. Such was hischarge: and he set the camels opposite the horsemen for this reason—because thehorse has a fear of the camel and cannot endure either to see his form or toscent his smell: for this reason then the trick had been devised, in order thatthe cavalry of Crœsus might be useless, that very force wherewith the Lydianking was expecting most to shine. And as they were coming together to thebattle, so soon as the horses scented the camels and saw them, they turned awayback, and the hopes of Crœsus were at once brought to nought.In fourteen days Sardis was stormed and Crœsus taken prisoner. . . .So the Persians having taken him brought him into the presence of Cyrus; and hepiled up a great pyre and caused Crœsus to go up upon it bound in fetters, andalong with him twice seven sons of Lydians, whether it was that he meant todedicate this offering as first-fruits of his victory to some god, or whether hedesired to fulfill a vow, or else had heard that Crœsus was a god-fearing man,and so caused him to go up on the pyre because he wished to know if anyone ofthe divine powers would save him, so that he should not be burnt alive. He, theysay, did this; but to Crœsus as he stood upon the pyre there came, although hewas in such evil case, a memory of the saying of Solon, how he had said withdivine inspiration that no one of the living might be called happy. And whenthis thought came into his mind, they say that he sighed deeply and groanedaloud, having been for long silent, and three times he uttered the name ofSolon. Hearing this, Cyrus bade the interpreters ask Crœsus who was this personon whom he called; and they came near and asked. And Crœsus for a time, it issaid, kept silence when he was asked this, but afterwards, being pressed, hesaid: “One whom more than much wealth I should have desired to have speech withall monarchs.” Then, since his words were of doubtful import, they asked againof that which he said; and as they were urgent with him and gave him no peace,he told how once Solon, an Athenian, had come and having inspected all hiswealth had made light of it, with such and such words; and how all had turnedout for him according as Solon had said, not speaking at all especially with aview to Crœsus himself, but with a view to the whole human race, and especiallythose who seem to themselves to be happy men. And while Crœsus related thesethings, already the pyre was lighted and the edges of it round about wereburning. Then they say that Cyrus, hearing from the interpreters what Crœsus hadsaid, changed his purpose and considered that he himself also was but a man, andthat he was delivering another man, who had been not inferior to himself infelicity, alive to the fire; and, moreover, he feared the requital, andreflected that there was nothing of that which men possessed which was secure;therefore, they say, he ordered them to extinguish as quickly as possible thefire that was burning, and to bring down Crœsus and those who were with him fromthe pyre; and they, using endeavours, were not able now to get the mastery ofthe flames. Then it is related by the Lydians that Crœsus, having learned howCyrus had changed his mind, and seeing that everyone was trying to put out thefire, but that they were no longer able to check it, cried aloud, entreatingApollo that if any gift had ever been given by him which was acceptable to thegod, he would come to his aid and rescue him from the evil which was now uponhim. So he with tears entreated the god, and suddenly, they say, after clear skyand calm weather clouds gathered and a storm burst, and it rained with a veryviolent shower, and the pyre was extinguished.Then Cyrus, having perceived that Crœsus was a lover of the gods and a good man,caused him to be brought down from the pyre and asked him as follows: “Crœsus,tell me who of all men was it who persuaded thee to march upon my land and so tobecome an enemy to me instead of a friend?” And he said: “O king, I did this tothy felicity and to my own misfortune, and the causer of this was the god of theHellenes, who incited me to march with my army. For no one is so senseless as tochoose of his own will war rather than peace, since in peace the sons bury theirfathers, but in war the fathers bury their sons. But it was pleasing, I suppose,to the divine powers that these things should come to pass thus.”So Crœsus became a councillor of Cyrus, and lived in Babylon. When Lydia wassubdued, Cyrus turned his attention to Nabonidus in Babylon. He defeated theBabylonian army, under Belshazzar, outside Babylon, and then laid siege to thetown. He entered the town (538 BC), probably as we have already suggested, withthe connivance of the priests of Bel.§ 7Cyrus was succeeded by his son Cambyses, who took an army into Egypt (525 BC).There was a battle in the delta, in which Greek mercenaries fought on bothsides. Herodotus declares that he saw the bones of the slain still lying on thefield fifty or sixty years later, and comments on the comparative thinness ofthe Persian skulls. After this battle Cambyses took Memphis and most of Egypt.In Egypt, we are told, Cambyses went mad. He took great liberties with theEgyptian temples, and remained at Memphis “opening ancient tombs and examiningthe dead bodies.” He had already murdered both Crœsus, ex-king of Lydia, and hisown brother Smerdis before coming to Egypt, and he died in Syria on the way backto Susa of an accidental wound, leaving no heirs to succeed him. He waspresently succeeded by Darius the Mede (521 BC), the son of Hystaspes, one ofthe chief councillors of Cyrus.The empire of Darius I was larger than anyone of the preceding empires whosegrowth we have traced. It included all Asia Minor and Syria, that is to say, theancient Lydian and Hittite empires, all the old Assyrian and Babylonian empires,Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian regions, Media, Persia, and it extended,perhaps, into India to the Indus. The nomadic Arabians alone of all the peoplesof what is nowadays called the Near East, did not pay tribute to the satraps(provincial governors) of Darius. The organization of this great empire seems tohave been on a much higher level of efficiency than any of its precursors. Greatarterial roads joined province to province, and there was a system of royalposts;5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en82] at stated intervals posthorses stood always ready to carry the government messenger, or the traveller ifhe had a government permit, on to the next stage of his journey. Apart from thisimperial right-of-way and the payment of tribute, the local governmentspossessed a very considerable amount of local freedom. They were restrained frominternecine conflict, which was all to their own good. And at first the Greekcities of the mainland of Asia paid the tribute and shared in this PersianPeace.Darius was first incited to attack the Greeks in Europe by a homesick Greekphysician at his court, who wanted at any cost to be back in Greece. Darius hadalready made plans for an expedition into Europe, aiming not at Greece, but tothe northward of Greece, across the Bosphorus and Danube. He wanted to strike atSouth Russia, which he believed to be the home country of the Scythian nomadswho threatened him on his northern and northeastern frontiers. But he lent anattentive ear to the tempter, and sent agents into Greece.This great expedition of Darius opens out our view in this history. It lifts acurtain upon the Balkan country behind Greece about which we have said nothinghitherto; it carries us to and over the Danube. The nucleus of his army marchedfrom Susa, gathering up contingents as they made their way to the Bosphorus.Here Greek allies (Ionian Greeks from Asia) had made a bridge of boats, and thearmy crossed over while the Greek allies sailed on in their ships to the Danube,and, two days’ sail up from its mouth, landed to make another floating bridge.Meanwhile, Darius and his host advanced along the coast of what is now Bulgaria,but which was then called Thrace. They crossed the Danube, and prepared to givebattle to the Scythian, army and take the cities of the Scythians.113 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_113_r1.gif]But the Scythians had no cities, and they evaded a battle, and the wardegenerated into a tedious and hopeless pursuit of more mobile enemies. Wellswere stopped up and pastures destroyed by the nomads. The Scythian horsemen hungupon the skirts of the great army, which consisted mostly of foot soldiers,picking off stragglers and preventing foraging; and they did their best topersuade the Ionian Greeks, who had made and were guarding the bridge across theDanube, to break up the bridge, and so ensure the destruction of Darius. So longas Darius continued to advance, however, the loyalty of his Greek alliesremained unshaken.But privation, fatigue, and sickness hindered and crippled the Persian army;Darius lost many stragglers and consumed his supplies, and at last themelancholy conviction dawned upon him that a retreat across the Danube wasnecessary to save him from complete exhaustion and defeat.In order to get a start in his retreat he sacrificed his sick and wounded. Hehad these men informed that he was about to attack the Scythians at nightfall,and under this pretence stole out of the camp with the pick of his troops andmade off southward, leaving the camp fires burning and the usual noises andmovements of the camp behind him. Next day the men left in the camp realized thetrick their monarch had played upon them, and surrendered themselves to themercy of the Scythians; but Darius had got his start, and was able to reach thebridge of boats before his pursuers came upon him. They were more mobile thanhis troops, but they missed their quarry in the darkness. At the river theretreating Persians “were brought to an extremity of fear,” for they found thebridge partially broken down and its northern end destroyed.At this point a voice echoes down the centuries to us. We see a group ofdismayed Persians standing about the Great King upon the bank of the streamingriver; we see the masses of halted troops, hungry and war-worn; a trail ofbattered transport stretches away towards the horizon, upon which at any timethe advance guards of the pursuers may appear. There is not much noise in spiteof the multitude, but rather an inquiring silence. Standing out like a pier fromthe further side of the great stream are the remains of the bridge of boats, anenigma. . . . We cannot discern whether there are men over there or not. Theshipping of the Ionian Greeks seems still to be drawn up on the further shore,but it is all very far away.“Now there was with Darius an Egyptian who had a voice louder than that of anyother man on earth, and this man Darius ordered to take his stand upon the bankof the Ister (Danube) and to call Histiæus of Miletus.” This worthy—a day is tocome, as we shall presently tell, when his decapitated head will be sent toDarius at Susa—appears approaching slowly across the waters in a boat.There is a parley, and we gather that it is “all right.”The explanation Histiæus has to make is a complicated one. Some Scythians havebeen and have gone again. Scouts, perhaps, these were. It would seem there hadbeen a discussion between the Scythians and the Greeks. The Scythians wanted thebridge broken down; they would then, they said, undertake to finish up thePersian army and make an end of Darius and his empire, and the Ionian Greeks ofAsia could then free their cities again. Miltiades, the Athenian, was foraccepting this proposal. But Histiæus had been more subtle. He would prefer, hesaid, to see the Persians completely destroyed before definitely abandoningtheir cause. Would the Scythians go back and destroy the Persians to make sureof them while the Greeks on their part destroyed the bridge? Anyhow, whicheverside the Greeks took finally, it was clear to him that it would be wise todestroy the northern end of the bridge, because otherwise the Scythians mightrush it. Indeed, even as they parleyed the Greeks set to work to demolish theend that linked them to the Scythians as quickly as possible. In accordance withthe suggestions of Histiæus the Scythians rode off in search of the Persians,and so left the Greeks safe in either event. If Darius escaped, they could be onhis side; if he were destroyed, there was nothing of which the Scythians couldcomplain.Histiæus did not put it quite in that fashion to Darius. He had at least keptthe shipping and most of the bridge. He represented himself as the loyal friendof Persia, and Darius was not disposed to be too critical. The Ionian ships cameover. With a sense of immense relief the remnant of the wasted Persians werepresently looking back at the steely flood of the Danube streaming wide betweenthemselves and their pursuers. . . .The pleasure and interest had gone out of the European expedition for Darius. Hereturned to Susa, leaving an army in Thrace, under a trusted general Megabazus.This Megabazus set himself to the subjugation of Thrace, and among other stateswhich submitted reluctantly to Darius was a kingdom, which thus comes into ourhistory for the first time, the kingdom of Macedonia, a country inhabited by apeople so closely allied to the Greeks that one of its princes had already beenallowed to compete and take a prize in the Olympian games.Darius was disposed to reward Histiæus by allowing him to build a city forhimself in Thrace, but Megabazus had a different opinion of the trustworthinessof Histiæus, and prevailed upon the king to take him to Susa, and, under thetitle of councillor, to keep him a prisoner there. Histiæus was at firstflattered by this court position, and then realized its true meaning. ThePersian court bored him, and he grew homesick for Miletus. He set himself tomake mischief, and was able to stir up a revolt against the Persians among theIonian Greeks on the mainland. The twistings and turnings of the story, whichincluded the burning of Sardis by the Ionians and the defeat of a Greek fleet atthe battle of Ladé (495 BC), are too complicated to follow here. It is a darkand intricate story of treacheries, cruelties, and hate, in which the death ofthe wily Histiæus shines almost cheerfully. The Persian governor of Sardis,through which town he was being taken on his way back to Susa as a prisoner,having much the same opinion of him as Megabazus had, and knowing his ability tohumbug Darius, killed him there and then, and sent on the head only to hismaster.Cyprus and the Greek islands were dragged into this contest that Histiæus hadstirred up, and at last Athens. Darius realized the error he had made in turningto the right and not to the left when he had crossed the Bosphorus, and he nowset himself to the conquest of all Greece. He began with the islands. Tyre andSidon were subject to Persia, and ships of the Phœnician and of the IonianGreeks provided the Persians with a fleet by means of which one Greek islandafter another was subjugated.§ 8The first attack upon Greece proper was made in 490 BC. It was a sea attack uponAthens, with a force long and carefully prepared for the task, the fleet beingprovided with specially built transports for the conveyance of horses. Thisexpedition made a landing near Marathon in Attica. The Persians were guided intoMarathon by a renegade Greek, Hippias, the son of Peisistratus, who had beentyrant of Athens. If Athens fell, then Hippias was to be its tyrant, under theprotection of the Persians. Meanwhile, so urgent was the sense of a crisis inthe affairs of Hellas, that a man, a herald and runner, went from Athens toSparta, forgetful of all feuds, to say: “Lacedemonians, the Athenians makerequest of you to come to their help, and not to allow a city most ancientlyestablished among the Hellenes to fall into slavery by the means of Barbarians;for even now Eretria has been enslaved and Hellas has become the weaker by acity of renown.” This man, Pheidippides, did the distance from Athens to Sparta,nearly a hundred miles as the crow flies, and much more if we allow for thecontours and the windings of the way, in something under eight and forty hours.But before the Spartans could arrive on the scene the battle was joined. TheAthenians charged the enemy. They fought—“in a memorable fashion: for they werethe first of all the Hellenes about whom we know who went to attack the enemy ata run, and they were the first also who endured to face the Median garments andthe men who wore them, whereas up to this time the very name of the Medes was tothe Hellenes a terror to hear.”114 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_114_r1.gif]The Persian wings gave before this impetuous attack, but the centre held. TheAthenians, however, were cool as well as vigorous; they let the wings run andclosed in on the flanks of the centre, whereupon the main body of the Persiansfled to their ships. Seven vessels fell into the hands of the Athenians; therest got away, and, after a futile attempt to sail round to Athens and seize thecity before the army returned thither, the fleet made a retreat to Asia. LetHerodotus close the story with a paragraph that still further enlightens us uponthe tremendous prestige of the Medes at this time:“Of the Lacedemonians there came to Athens two thousand after the full moon,making great haste to be in time, so that they arrived in Attica on the thirdday after leaving Sparta: and though they had come too late for the battle, yetthey desired to behold the Medes; and accordingly they went on to Marathon andlooked at the bodies of the slain: then afterwards they departed home,commending the Athenians and the work which they had done.”§ 9So Greece, unified for a while by fear, gained her first victory over Persia.The news came to Darius simultaneously with the news of a rebellion in Egypt,and he died while still undecided in which direction to turn. His son andsuccessor, Xerxes, turned first to Egypt and set up a Persian satrap there; thenfor four years he prepared a second attack upon Greece. Says Herodotus, who was,one must remember, a patriotic Greek, approaching now to the climax of hisHistory:“For what nation did Xerxes not lead out of Asia against Hellas? And what waterwas not exhausted, being drunk by his host, except only the great rivers? Forsome supplied ships, and others were appointed to serve in the land army; tosome it was appointed to furnish cavalry, and to others vessels to carry horses,while they served in the expedition themselves also; others were ordered tofurnish ships of war for the bridges, and others again ships with provisions.”Xerxes passed into Europe, not as Darius did at the half-mile crossing of theBosphorus, but at the Hellespont (== the Dardanelles). In his account of theassembling of the great army, and its march from Sardis to the Hellespont, thepoet in Herodotus takes possession of the historian. The great host passes insplendour by Troy, and Xerxes, who although a Persian and a Barbarian, seems tohave had the advantages of a classical education, turns aside, says ourhistorian, to visit the citadel of Priam. The Hellespont was bridged at Abydos,and upon a hill was set a marble throne from which Xerxes surveyed the wholearray of his forces. And seeing all the Hellespont covered over with the ships and all the shores andthe plains of Abydos full of men, then Xerxes pronounced himself a happy man,and after that he fell to weeping. Artabanus, his uncle, therefore perceivinghim—the same who at first boldly declared his opinion advising Xerxes not tomarch against Hellas—this man, I say, having observed Xerxes wept, asked asfollows: “O king, how far different from one another are the things which thouhast done now and a short while before now! For having pronounced thyself ahappy man, thou art now shedding tears.” He said: “Yea, for after I had reckonedup, it came into my mind to feel pity at the thought how brief was the wholelife of man, seeing that of these multitudes not one will be alive when ahundred years have gone by.”115 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_115_r1.gif]This may not be exact history, but it is great poetry. It is as splendid asanything in The Dynasts.The Persian fleet, coasting from headland to headland, accompanied this landmultitude during its march southward; but a violent storm did the fleet greatdamage and four hundred ships were lost, including much corn transport. At firstthe united Hellenes marched out to meet the invaders at the Vale of Tempe nearMount Olympus, but afterwards retreated through Thessaly, and chose at last toawait the advancing Persians at a place called Thermopylæ, where at thattime—2,300 years have altered these things greatly—there was a great cliff onthe landward side and the sea to the east, with a track scarcely wide enough fora chariot between. The great advantage to the Greeks of this position atThermopylæ was that it prevented the use of either cavalry or chariots, andnarrowed the battle front so as to minimize their numerical inequality. Andthere the Persians joined battle with them one summer day in the year 480 BC.For three days the Greeks held this great army, and did them much damage withsmall loss to themselves, and then on the third day a detachment of Persiansappeared upon the rear of the Greeks, having learnt of a way over the mountainsfrom a peasant. There were hasty discussions among the Greeks; some were forwithdrawing, some for holding out. The leader of the whole force, Leonidas, wasfor staying; and with him he would keep, he said, three hundred Spartans. Therest of the Greek army could, meanwhile, make good its retreat to the nextdefensible pass. The Thespian contingent of seven hundred, however, refused tofall back. They preferred to stay and die with the Spartans. Also a contingentof four hundred Thebans remained. As Thebes afterwards joined the Persians,there is a story that these Thebans were detained by force against their will,which seems on military as well as historical grounds improbable. These 1,400stayed, and were, after a conflict of heroic quality, slain to a man. TwoSpartans happened to be away, sick with ophthalmia. When they heard the news,one was too ill to move; the other made his helot guide him to the battle, andthere struck blindly until he was killed. The other, Aristodemus, was taken awaywith the retreating troops, and returned to Sparta, where he was not actuallypunished for his conduct, but was known as Tresas, “the man who retreated.” Itwas enough to distinguish him from all other Spartans, and he got himself killedat the Battle of Platæa a year later, performing prodigies of reckless courage.. . . For a whole day this little band had held the pass, assailed in front andrear by the whole force of the Persians. They had covered the retreat of themain Greek army, they had inflicted great losses on the invaders, and they hadraised the prestige of the Greek warrior over that of the Mede higher even thanthe victory of Marathon had done.The Persian cavalry and transport filtered slowly through the narrow passage ofThermopylæ, and marched on towards Athens, while a series of naval encounterswent on at sea. The Hellenic fleet retreated before the advance of the Persianshipping, which suffered seriously through its comparative ignorance of theintricate coasts and of the tricks of the local weather. Weight of numberscarried the Persian army forward to Athens; now that Thermopylæ was lost, therewas no line of defence nearer than the Isthmus of Corinth, and this meant theabandonment of all the intervening territory, including Athens. The populationhad either to fly or submit to the Persians. Thebes with all Bœotia submitted,and was pressed into the Persian army, except one town, Platæa, whoseinhabitants fled to Athens. The turn of Athens came next, and great efforts weremade to persuade her to make terms; but, instead, the whole populationdetermined to abandon everything and take to the shipping. The women andnon-combatants were carried to Salamis and various adjacent islands. Only a fewpeople too old to move and a few dissentients remained in the town, which wasoccupied by the Persians and burnt. The sacred objects, statues, etc., whichwere burnt at this time, were afterwards buried in the Acropolis by thereturning Athenians, and have been dug up in our own day with the marks ofburning visible upon them. Xerxes sent off a mounted messenger to Susa with thenews, and he invited the sons of Peisistratus, whom he had brought back withhim, to enter upon their inheritance and sacrifice after the Athenian mannerupon the Acropolis.116 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_116_r1.gif]Meanwhile, the Hellenic confederate fleet had come round to Salamis, and in thecouncil of war there were bitter differences of opinion. Corinth and the statesbehind the Isthmus wanted the fleet to fall back to that position, abandoningthe cities of Megara and Ægina. Themistocles insisted with all his force onfighting in the narrows of Salamis. The majority was steadily in favour ofretreat, when there suddenly arrived the news that retreat was cut off. ThePersians had sailed round Salamis and held the sea on the other side. This newswas brought by that Aristides the Just, of whose ostracism we have already told;his sanity and eloquence did much to help Themistocles to hearten the hesitatingcommanders. These two men had formerly been bitter antagonists; but, with agenerosity rare in those days, they forgot their differences before the commondanger. At dawn the Greek ships pulled out to battle.117 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_117_r1.gif]The fleet before them was a fleet more composite and less united than their own.But it was about three times as great. On one wing were the Phœnicians, on theother Ionian Greeks from Asia and the Islands. Some of the latter foughtstoutly; others remembered that they, too, were Greeks. The Greek ships, on theother hand, were mostly manned by freemen fighting for their homes. Throughoutthe early hours the battle raged confusedly. Then it became evident to Xerxes,watching the combat, that his fleet was attempting flight. The flight becamedisaster.Xerxes had taken his seat to watch the battle. He saw his galleys rammed by thesharp prows of other galleys; his fighting-men shot down; his ships boarded.Much of the sea-fighting in those days was done by ramming; the big galleys boredown their opponents by superior weight of impact, or sheared off their oars andso destroyed their manœuvring power and left them helpless. Presently, Xerxessaw that some of his broken ships were surrendering. In the water he could seethe heads of Greeks swimming to land; but “of the Barbarians the greater numberperished in the sea, not knowing how to swim.” The clumsy attempt of thehard-pressed first line of the Persian fleet to put about led to indescribableconfusion. Some were rammed by the rear ships of their own side. This ancientshipping was poor, unseaworthy stuff by any modern standards. The west wind wasblowing and many of the broken ships of Xerxes were now drifting away out of hissight to be wrecked on the coast beyond. Others were being towed towards Salamisby the Greeks. Others, less injured and still in fighting trim, were making forthe beaches close beneath him that would bring them under the protection of hisarmy. Scattered over the further sea, beyond the headlands, remote and vague,were ships in flight and Greek ships in pursuit. Slowly, incident by incident,the disaster had unfolded under his eyes. We can imagine something of the comingand going of messengers, the issuing of futile orders, the changes of plan,throughout the day. In the morning Xerxes had come out provided with tables tomark the most successful of his commanders for reward. In the gold of the sunsethe beheld the sea power of Persia utterly scattered, sunken and destroyed, andthe Greek fleet over against Salamis unbroken and triumphant, ordering itsranks, as if still incredulous of victory.The Persian army remained as if in indecision for some days close to the sceneof this sea fight, and then began to retreat to Thessaly, where it was proposedto winter and resume the campaign. But Xerxes, like Darius I before him, hadconceived a disgust for European campaigns. He was afraid of the destruction ofthe bridge of boats. With part of the army he went on to the Hellespont, leavingthe main force in Thessaly under a general, Mardonius. Of his own retreat thehistorian relates: Whithersoever they came on the march and to whatever nationthey seized the crops of that people and used them for provisions; and if theyfound no crops, then they took the grass which was growing up from the earth,and stripped off the bark from the trees and plucked down the leaves anddevoured them; alike of the cultivated trees and of those growing wild; and theyleft nothing behind them: thus they did by reason of famine. Then plague tooseized upon the army and dysentery, which destroyed them by the way, and some ofthem also who were sick the king left behind, laying charge upon the citieswhere at the time he chanced to be in his march, to take care of them andsupport them; of these he left some in Thessaly, and some at Siris in Paionia,and some in Macedonia. . . . When, passing on from Thrace they came to thepassage, they crossed over the Hellespont in haste to Abydos by means of theships, for they did not find the floating bridges still stretched across, butbroken up by a storm. While staying there for a time they had distributed tothem an allowance of food more abundant than they had had by the way, and fromsatisfying their hunger without restraint and also from the changes of waterthere died many of those in the army who had remained safe till then. The restarrived with Xerxes at Sardis.§ 10The rest of the Persian army remained in Thessaly under the command ofMardonius, and for a year he maintained an aggressive campaign against theGreeks. Finally, he was defeated and killed in a pitched battle at Platæa (479BC), and on the same day the Persian fleet and a land army met with jointdisaster under the shadow of Mount Mycale on the Asiatic mainland, betweenEphesus and Miletus. The Persian ships, being in fear of the Greeks, had beendrawn up on shore and a wall built about them; but the Greeks disembarked andstormed this enclosure. They then sailed to the Hellespont to destroy what wasleft of the bridge of boats, so that later the Persian fugitives, retreatingfrom Platæa, had to cross by shipping at the Bosphorus, and did so withdifficulty.Encouraged by these disasters of the imperial power, says Herodotus, the Ioniancities in Asia began for a second time to revolt against the Persians.With this the ninth book of the History of Herodotus comes to an end. He wasborn about 484 BC, so that at the time of the battle of Platæa he was a child offive years old. Much of the substance of his story was gathered by him fromactors in, and eyewitnesses of, the great events he relates. The war stilldragged on for a long time; the Greeks supported a rebellion against Persianrule in Egypt, and tried unsuccessfully to take Cyprus; it did not end untilabout 449 BC. Then the Greek coasts of Asia Minor and the Greek cities in theBlack Sea remained generally free, but Cyprus and Egypt continued under Persianrule. Herodotus, who had been born a Persian subject in the Ionian city ofHalicarnassus, was five and thirty years old by that time, and he must havetaken an early opportunity after this peace of visiting Babylon and Persia. Heprobably went to Athens, with his History ready to recite, about 438 BC.The idea of a great union of Greece for aggression against Persia was notaltogether strange to Herodotus. Some of his readers suspect him of writing toenforce it. It was certainly in the air at that time. He describes Aristagoras,the son-in-law of Histiæus, as showing the Spartans “a tablet of bronze on whichwas engraved a map of the whole earth with all the seas and rivers.” He makesAristagoras say:These Barbarians are not valiant in fight. You, on the other hand, have nowattained to the utmost skill in war. They fight with bows and arrows and a shortspear: they go into battle wearing trousers and having caps on their heads. Youhave perfected your weapons and discipline. They are easily to be conquered. Notall the other nations of the world have what they possess; gold, silver, bronze,embroidered garments, beasts and slaves; all this you might have for yourselves,if you so desired.It was a hundred years before these suggestions bore fruit.Xerxes was murdered in his palace about 465 BC, and thereafter Persia made nofurther attempts at conquest in Europe. We have no such knowledge of the thingsthat were happening in the empire of the Great King as we have of theoccurrences in the little states of Central Greece. Greece had suddenly begun toproduce literature, and put itself upon record as no other nation had ever donehitherto. After 479 BC (Platæa) the spirit seems to have gone out of thegovernment of the Medes and Persians. The empire of the Great King enters upon aperiod of decay. An Artaxerxes, a second Xerxes, a second Darius, pass acrossthe stage; there are rebellions in Egypt and Syria; the Medes rebel; a secondArtaxerxes and a second Cyrus, his brother, fight for the throne. This historyis even as the history of Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt in the older times. Itis autocracy reverting to its normal state of palace crime, blood-stainedmagnificence, and moral squalor. But the last-named struggle produced a Greekmasterpiece, for this second Cyrus collected an army of Greek mercenaries andmarched into Babylonia, and was there killed at the moment of victory overArtaxerxes II. Thereupon, the Ten Thousand Greeks, left with no one to employthem, made a retreat to the coast again (401 BC), and this retreat wasimmortalized in a book, one of the first of personal war books, the Anabasis, bytheir leader Xenophon.Murders, revolts, chastisements, disasters, cunning alliances, and basebetrayals, and no Herodotus to record them. Such is the texture of Persianhistory. An Artaxerxes III, covered with blood, flourishes dimly for a time.“Artaxerxes III is said to have been murdered by Bagoas, who places Arses, theyoungest of the king’s sons, on the throne only to slay him in turn when heseemed to be contemplating independent action.”6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en83] So it goes on.Athens, prospering for a time after the Persian repulse, was smitten by theplague in which Pericles, its greatest ruler, died (428 BC). But, as anoteworthy fact amidst these confusions, the Ten Thousand of Xenophon werescattering now among the Greek cities, repeating from their own experience thedeclaration of Aristagoras that the Persian empire was a rich confusion which itwould be very easy for resolute men to conquer."},{"pageContent":"118 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_118_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 119[bano_9781411428843_oeb_119_r1.gif]GREEK THOUGHT IN RELATION TO HUMAN SOCIETY§ 1.

THE QUALITYAND LIMITATIONS OF GREEK THOUGHT.§ 1GREEK HISTORY FOR THE NEXT FORTY YEARS AFTER PLATÆA AND MYCALE is a story ofcomparative peace and tranquillity. There were wars, but they were not intensewars. For a little while in Athens, for a section of the prosperous, there wasleisure and opportunity. And by a combination of accidents and through thecharacter of a small group of people, this leisure and opportunity produced themost memorable results. Much beautiful literature was produced; the plastic artsflourished, and the foundations of modern science, already laid by the earlierphilosophers of the Ionian Greek cities, were consolidated. Then, after aninterlude of fifty odd years, the long-smouldering hostility between Athens andSparta broke out into a fierce and exhausting war, which sapped at last thevitality of this creative movement.This war is known in history as the Peloponnesian War; it went on for nearlythirty years, and wasted all the power of Greece. At first Athens was in theascendant, then Sparta. Then arose Thebes, a city not fifty miles from Athens,to overshadow Sparta. Once more Athens flared into importance as the head of aconfederation. It is a story of narrow rivalries and inexplicable hatreds thatwould have vanished long ago out of the memories of men, were it not that it isrecorded and reflected in a great literature.Through all this time Persia appears and reappears as the ally first of thisleague and then of that. About the middle of the fourth century BC, Greecebecomes aware of a new influence in its affairs, that of Philip, King ofMacedonia. Macedonia does, indeed, arise in the background of this incurablydivided Greece, as the Medes and Persians arose behind the Chaldean Empire. Atime comes when the Greek mind turns round, so to speak, from its disputes, andstares in one united dismay at the Macedonian.Planless and murderous squabbles are still planless and murderous squabbles eventhough Thucydides tells the story, even though the great beginnings of a newcivilization are wrecked by their disorders; and in this general outline we cangive no space at all to the particulars of these internecine feuds, to thefights and flights that sent first this Greek city and then that up to the skyin flames. Upon a one-foot globe Greece becomes a speck almost too small torecognize; and in a short history of mankind, all this century and more ofdissension between the days of Salamis and Platæa and the rise of King Philipshrinks to a little, almost inaudible clash of disputation, to a mere note uponthe swift passing of opportunity for nations as for men.But what does not shrink into insignificance, because it has entered into theintellectual process of all subsequent nations, because it is inseparably a partof our mental foundation, is the literature that Greece produced during suchpatches and gleams of tranquillity and security as these times afforded her.Says Professor Gilbert Murray:1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en84]Their outer political history, indeed, like that of all other nations, is filledwith war and diplomacy, with cruelty and deceit. It is the inner history, thehistory of thought and feeling and character, that is so grand. They had somedifficulties to contend with which are now almost out of our path. They hadpractically no experience, but were doing everything for the first time; theywere utterly weak in material resources, and their emotions, their “desires andfears and rages,” were probably wilder and fiercer than ours. Yet they producedthe Athens of Pericles and of Plato.This remarkable culmination of the long-gathering creative power of the Greekmind, which for three and twenty centuries has been to men of intelligence aguiding and inspiring beacon out of the past, flared up after the battles ofMarathon and Salamis had made Athens free and fearless, and, without any greatexcesses of power, predominant in her world. It was the work of a quite smallgroup of men. A number of her citizens lived for the better part of a generationunder conditions which, in all ages, have disposed men to produce good andbeautiful work; they were secure, they were free, and they had pride; and theywere without that temptation of apparent and unchallenged power which disposesall of us to inflict wrongs upon our fellow men. When political life narroweddown again to the waste and crimes of a fratricidal war with Sparta, there wasso broad and well-fed a flame of intellectual activity burning that it lastedthrough all the windy distresses of this war and beyond the brief lifetime ofAlexander the Great, for a period altogether of more than a hundred years afterthe wars began.Flushed with victory and the sense of freedom fairly won, the people of Athensdid for a time rise towards nobility. Under the guidance of a great demagogue,Pericles, the chief official of the Athenian general assembly, and a politicianstatesman rather of the calibre of Gladstone or Lincoln in modern history, theywere set to the task of rebuilding their city and expanding their commerce. Fora time they were capable of following a generous leader generously, and Fategave them a generous leader. In Pericles there was mingled in the strangestfashion political ability with a real living passion for deep and high andbeautiful things. He kept in power for over thirty years. He was a man ofextraordinary vigour and liberality of mind. He stamped these qualities upon histime. As Winckler has remarked, the Athenian democracy had for a time “the faceof Pericles.” He was sustained by what was probably a very great and noblefriendship. There was a woman of unusual education, Aspasia, from Miletus, whomhe could not marry because of the law that restricted the citizenship of Athensto the home-born, but who was in effect his wife. She played a large part ingathering about him men of unusual gifts. All the great writers of the time knewher, and several have praised her wisdom. Plutarch, it is true, accuses her ofinstigating a troublesome and dangerous but finally successful war againstSamos, but, as he himself shows later, this was necessitated by the navalhostility of the Samians, which threatened the overseas trade of Athens, uponwhich all the prosperity of the republic depended.Men’s ambitions are apt to reflect the standards of their intimates. Pericleswas content, at any rate, to serve as a leader in Athens rather than to dominateas a tyrant. Alliances were formed under his guidance, new colonies and tradingstations were established from Italy to the Black Sea; and the treasures of theleague at Delos were brought to Athens. Convinced of his security from Persia,Pericles spent the war hoard of the allies upon the beautification of his city.This was an unrighteous thing to do by our modern standards, but it was not abase or greedy thing to do. Athens had accomplished the work of the DelianLeague, and is not the labourer worthy of his hire? This sequestration made atime of exceptional opportunity for architects and artists. The Parthenon ofAthens, whose ruins are still a thing of beauty, was but the crown set upon theclustering glories of the Athens Pericles rebuilt. Such sculptures as those ofPhidias, Myron, and Polyclitus that still survive, witness to the artisticquality of the time.The reader must bear in mind that illuminating remark of Winckler’s, which saysthat this renascent Athens bore for a time the face of Pericles. It was thepeculiar genius of this man and of his atmosphere that let loose the genius ofmen about him, and attracted men of great intellectual vigour to Athens. Athenswore his face for a time as one wears a mask, and then became restless anddesired to put him aside. There was very little that was great and generousabout the common Athenian. We have told of the spirit of one sample voter forthe ostracism of Aristides, and Lloyd (in his Age of Pericles) declares that theAthenians would not suffer the name of Miltiades to be mentioned in connectionwith the battle of Marathon. The sturdy self-respect of the common votersrevolted presently against the beautiful buildings rising about them; againstthe favours shown to such sculptors as Phidias over popular worthies in the sameline of business; against the donations made to a mere foreigner like Herodotusof Halicarnassus; against the insulting preference of Pericles for the companyand conversation of a Milesian woman. The public life of Pericles wasconspicuously orderly, and that presently set the man in the street thinkingthat his private life must be very corrupt. One gathers that Pericles was“superior” in his demeanour; he betrayed at times a contempt for the citizens heserved.Pericles acquired not only an elevation of sentiment, and a loftiness and purityof style far removed from the low expression of the vulgar, but likewise agravity of countenance which relaxed not into laughter, a firm and even tone ofvoice, an easy deportment, and a decency of dress which no vehemence of speakingever put into disorder. These things, and others of a like nature, excitedadmiration in all that saw him. Such was his conduct, when a vile and abandonedfellow loaded him a whole day with reproaches and abuse; he bore it withpatience and silence, and continued in public for the despatch of some urgentaffairs. In the evening he walked softly home, this impudent wretch following,and insulting him all the way with the most scurrilous language. And as it wasdark when he came to his own door, he ordered one of his servants to take atorch and light the man home. The poet Ion, however, says he was proud andsupercilious in conversation, and that there was a great deal of vanity andcontempt of others mixed with his dignity of manner. . . . He appeared not inthe streets except when he went to the forum or the senate house. He declinedthe invitations of his friends, and all social entertainments and recreations;insomuch that in the whole time of his administration, which was a considerablelength, he never went to sup with any of his friends but once, which was at themarriage of his nephew Euryptolemus, and he stayed there only until the ceremonyof libation was ended. He considered that the freedom of entertainments takesaway all distinction of office, and that dignity is but little consistent withfamiliarity. . . .2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en85]There was as yet no gutter journalism to tell the world of the vileness of theconspicuous and successful; but the common man, a little out of conceit withhimself, found much consolation in the art of comedy, which flourishedexceedingly. The writers of comedy satisfied that almost universal craving forthe depreciation of those whose apparent excellence offends our self-love. Theythrew dirt steadily and industriously at Pericles and his friends. Pericles wasportrayed in a helmet; a helmet became him, and it is to be feared he knew asmuch. This led to much joy and mirth over the pleasant suggestion of afrightfully distorted head, an onion head. The “goings on” of Aspasia were ofcourse a fruitful vineyard for the inventions of the street. . . .120 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_120_r1.gif]Dreaming souls, weary of the vulgarities of our time, have desired to betransferred to the sublime Age of Pericles. But, plumped down into that Athens,they would have found themselves in very much the atmosphere of the lower sortof contemporary music-hall, very much in the vein of our popular newspapers; thesame hot blast of braying libel, foul imputation, greedy “patriotism,” andgeneral baseness would have blown upon them, the “modern note” would havepursued them. As the memories of Platæa and Salamis faded and the new buildingsgrew familiar, Pericles and the pride of Athens became more and more offensiveto the homely humour of the crowd. He was never ostracized—his prestige with thequieter citizens saved him from that; but he was attacked with increasingboldness and steadfastness. He lived and died a poor man; he was perhaps themost honest of demagogues; but this did not save him from an abortiveprosecution for peculation. Defeated in that, his enemies resorted to a moredevious method; they began to lop away his friends.Religious intolerance and moral accusations are the natural weapons of theenvious against the leaders of men. His friend Damon was ostracized. Phidias wasattacked for impiety. On the shield of the great statue of the goddess Athene,Phidias had dared to put, among the combatants in a fight between Greeks andAmazons, portraits of Pericles and himself. Phidias died in prison. Anaxagoras,a stranger welcomed to Athens by Pericles—when there were plenty of honestfellows already there quite willing to satisfy any reasonable curiosities—wassaying the strangest things about, the sun and stars, and hinting not obscurelythat there were no gods, but only one animating spirit (nous) in the world.3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en86] The comedy writers suddenly found theyhad deep religious feelings that could be profoundly and even dangerouslyshocked, and Anaxagoras fled the threat of a prosecution. Then came the turn ofAspasia. Athens seemed bent upon deporting her, and Pericles was torn betweenthe woman who was the soul of his life and the ungracious city he had saved,defended, and made more beautiful and unforgettable than any other city inhistory. He stood up to defend Aspasia, he was seized by a storm of very humanemotion, and as he spoke he wept—a gleeful thing for the rabble. His tears savedAspasia for a time.The Athenians were content to humiliate Pericles, but he had served them so longthat they were indisposed to do without him. He had been their leader now for athird of a century.In 431 BC came the war with Sparta. Plutarch accuses Pericles of bringing it on,because he felt his popularity waned so fast that a war was needed to make himindispensable.“And as he himself was become obnoxious to the people upon Phidias’ account, andwas afraid of being called in question for it, he urged on the war, which as yetwas uncertain, and blew up that flame which till then was stifled andsuppressed. By this means he hoped to obviate the accusations that threatenedhim, and to mitigate the rage of envy, because such was his dignity and power,that in all important affairs, and in every great danger, the republic couldplace its confidence in him alone.”But the war was a slow and dangerous war, and the Athenian people wereimpatient. A certain Cleon arose, ambitious to oust Pericles from hisleadership. There was a great clamour for a swift ending of the war. Cleon setout to be “the man who won the war.” The popular poets got to work in thisfashion:Thou king of satyrs . . . why boast thy prowess, Yet shudder at the sound ofsharpened swords, Spite of the flaming Cleon?An expedition under the leadership of Pericles was unsuccessful, and Cleonseized the opportunity for a prosecution. Pericles was suspended from hiscommand and fined. The story goes that his oldest son—this was not the son ofAspasia, but of a former wife—turned against him, and pursued him with vile andincredible accusations. This young man was carried off by the plague. Then thesister of Pericles died, and then his last legitimate son. When, after thefashion of the time, he put the funeral garlands on the boy he wept aloud.Presently he himself took the contagion and died (428 BC).The salient facts of this brief summary will serve to show how discordantPericles was with much of the life of his city. This intellectual and artisticoutbreak in Athens was no doubt favoured by the conditions of the time, but itwas also due in part to the appearance of some very unusual men. It was not ageneral movement; it was the movement of a small group of people exceptionallyplaced and gifted.§ 2Another leading figure in this Athenian movement, a figure still more out ofharmony with the life around him, and quite as much an original source andstimulant of the enduring greatness of his age, was a man called Socrates, a sonof a stonemason. He was born about sixteen years later than Herodotus, and hewas beginning to be heard of about the time when Pericles died. He himself wrotenothing, but it was his custom to talk in public places. There was in those daysa great searching for wisdom going on; there was a various multitude of teacherscalled sophists who reasoned upon truth, beauty, and right living, andinstructed the developing curiosities and imaginations of youth. This was sobecause there were no great priestly schools in Greece. And into thesediscussions this man came, a clumsy and slovenly figure, barefooted, gatheringabout him a band of admirers and disciples.His method was profoundly sceptical; he believed that the only possible virtuewas true knowledge; he would tolerate no belief, no hope that could not pass theultimate acid test. For himself this meant virtue, but for many of his weakerfollowers it meant the loss of beliefs and moral habits that would haverestrained their impulses. These weaklings became self-excusing, self-indulgingscoundrels. Among his young associates were Plato, who afterwards immortalizedhis method in a series of philosophical dialogues, and founded the philosophicalschool of the Academy, which lasted nine hundred years, Xenophon, of the TenThousand, who described his death, and Isocrates, one of the wisest of Greekpolitical thinkers; but there were also Critias, who, when Athens was utterlydefeated by Sparta, was leader among the Thirty Tyrants appointed by theSpartans to keep the crushed city under;4[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en87] Charmides, who was killed besideCritias when the Thirty were overthrown; and Alcibiades, a brilliant and complextraitor, who did much to lead Athens into the disastrous expedition againstSyracuse which destroyed her strength, who betrayed her to the Spartans, and whowas at last assassinated while on his way to the Persian court to contrivemischief against Greece. These latter pupils were not the only young men ofpromise whose vulgar faith and patriotism Socrates destroyed, to leave nothingin its place. His most inveterate enemy was a certain Anytus, whose son, adevoted disciple of Socrates, had become a hopeless drunkard. Through Anytus itwas that Socrates was at last prosecuted for “corrupting” the youth of Athens,and condemned to death by drinking a poisonous draught made from hemlock (399BC).His death is described with great beauty in the dialogue of Plato called by thename of Phædo.§ 3Plato was born 427 BC, and he lived for eighty years.In mental temperament Plato was of an altogether different type from Socrates.He was a most artistic and delicate writer, and Socrates could write nothingconsecutive. He cared for beautiful things and Socrates despised them. He wassupremely concerned with the ordering of public affairs and the scheming ofhappier human relationships, while Socrates, heedless of heat and cold and theopinion of his fellow creatures, concentrated his mind upon a serenedisillusionment. Life, said Socrates, was deception; only the Soul lived. Platohad a very great affection for this rugged old teacher, he found his method ofthe utmost value in disentangling and cleaning up opinions, and he made him thecentral figure of his immortal dialogues; but his own thoughts and dispositionturned him altogether away from the sceptical attitude. In many of the dialoguesthe voice is the voice of Socrates, but the thought is the thought of Plato.Plato was living in a time of doubt and questioning about all humanrelationships. In the great days of Pericles, before 450 BC, there seems to havebeen a complete satisfaction in Athens with social and political institutions.Then there seemed no reason for questioning. Men felt free; the communityprospered; one suffered chiefly from jealousy. The History of Herodotus displayslittle or no dissatisfaction with Athenian political institutions.But Plato, who was born about the time Herodotus died, and who grew up in theatmosphere of a disastrous war and great social distress and confusion, was fromthe first face to face with human discord and the misfit of human institutions.To that challenge his mind responded. One of his earlier works and his latestare bold and penetrating discussions of the possible betterment of socialrelations. Socrates had taught him to take nothing for granted, not even thecommon relations of husband and wife or parent and child. His Republic, thefirst of all Utopian books, is a young man’s dream of a city in which human lifeis arranged according to a novel and a better plan; his last unfinished work,the Laws, is a discussion of the regulation of another such Utopia. There ismuch in Plato at which we cannot even glance here, but it is a landmark in thishistory, it is a new thing in the development of mankind, this appearance of theidea of wilfully and completely recasting human conditions. So far mankind hasbeen living by tradition under the fear of the gods. Here is a man who saysboldly to our race, and as if it were a quite reasonable and natural thing tosay, “Take hold of your lives. Most of these things that distress you, you canavoid; most of these things that dominate you, you can overthrow. You can do asyou will with them.”One other thing besides the conflicts of the time perhaps stimulated the mind ofPlato in this direction. In the days of Pericles Athens had founded manysettlements overseas, and the setting up of these settlements had familiarizedmen with the idea that a community need not grow, it could also be made.Closely associated with Plato was a younger man, who later also maintained aschool in Athens and lived to an even greater age. This was Isocrates. He waswhat we should call a publicist, a writer rather than an orator, and hispeculiar work was to develop the idea of Herodotus, the idea of a unification ofGreece against the Persian Empire, as a remedy for the baseness and confusion ofher politics and the waste and destruction of her internecine wars. Hispolitical horizon was in some respects broader than Plato’s, and in his lateryears he looked towards monarchy, and particularly towards the Macedonianmonarchy of Philip, as a more unifying and broadening method of government thancity democracy. The same drift to monarchist ideas had occurred in the case ofthat Xenophon whose Anabasis we have already mentioned. In his old age Xenophonwrote the Cyropædia, a “vindication both theoretically and practically ofabsolute monarchy as shown in the organization of the Persian Empire.”5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en88]§ 4Plato taught in the Academy. To him in his old age came a certain good-lookingyoungster from Stagira in Macedonia, Aristotle, who was the son of theMacedonian king’s physician, and a man with a very different type of mind fromthat of the great Athenian. He was naturally sceptical of the imaginative will,and with a great respect for and comprehension of established fact. Later on,after Plato was dead, he set up a school at the Lyceum in Athens and taught,criticizing Plato and Socrates with a certain hardness. When he taught, theshadow of Alexander the Great lay across the freedom of Greece, and he favouredslavery and constitutional kings. He had previously been the tutor of Alexanderfor several years at the court of Philip of Macedon. Intelligent men were losingheart in those days, their faith in the power of men to make their ownconditions of life was fading. There were no more Utopias. The rush of eventswas manifestly too powerful for such organized effort as was then practicablebetween men of fine intelligence. It was possible to think of recasting humansociety when human society was a little city of a few thousand citizens, butwhat was happening about them was something cataclysmal; it was the politicalrecasting of the whole known world, of the affairs of what even then must haveamounted to something between fifty and a hundred million people. It wasrecasting upon a scale no human mind was yet equipped to grasp. It drove thoughtback upon the idea of a vast and implacable Fate. It made men snatch at whateverlooked stable and unifying. Monarchy, for instance, for all its manifest vices,was a conceivable government for millions; it had, to a certain extent, worked;it imposed a ruling will where it would seem that a collective will wasimpossible. This change of the general intellectual mood harmonized withAristotle’s natural respect for existing fact. If, on the one hand, it made himapprove of monarchy and slavery and the subjection of women as reasonableinstitutions, on the other hand it made him eager to understand fact and to getsome orderly knowledge of these realities of nature and human nature that werenow so manifestly triumphant over the creative dreams of the precedinggeneration. He is terribly sane and luminous, and terribly wanting inself-sacrificial enthusiasm. He questions Plato when Plato would exile poetsfrom his Utopia, for poetry is a power; he directs his energy along a linediametrically opposed to Socrates’ depreciation of Anaxagoras. He anticipatesBacon and the modern scientific movement in his realization of the importance ofordered knowledge. He set himself to the task of gathering together and settingdown knowledge. He was the first natural historian. Other men before him hadspeculated about the nature of things, but he, with every young man he could winover to the task, set himself to classify and compare things. Plato says ineffect: “Let us take hold of life and remodel it”; this soberer successor: “Letus first know more of life and meanwhile serve the king.” It was not so much acontradiction as an immense qualification of the master.The peculiar relation of Aristotle to Alexander the Great enabled him to procuremeans for his work such as were not available again for scientific inquiry forlong ages. He could command hundreds of talents (a talent == about £240) for hisexpenses. At one time he had at his disposal a thousand men scattered throughoutAsia and Greece, collecting matter for his natural history. They were, ofcourse, very untrained observers, collectors of stories rather than observers;but nothing of the kind had ever been attempted, had even been thought of, sofar as we know, before his time. Political as well as natural science began. Thestudents of the Lyceum under his direction made an analysis of 158 politicalconstitutions. . . .This was the first gleam of organized science in the world. The early death ofAlexander and the breaking up of his empire almost before it had begun, put anend to endowments on this scale for 2,000 years. Only in Egypt at the AlexandriaMuseum did any scientific research continue, and that only for a fewgenerations. Of that we will presently tell. Fifty years after Aristotle’sdeath, the Lyceum had already dwindled to insignificance.§ 5The general drift of thought in the concluding years of the fourth century BCwas not with Aristotle, nor towards the laborious and necessary accumulation ofordered knowledge. It is possible that without his endowments from the king hewould have made but a small figure in intellectual history. Through them he wasable to give his splendid intelligence substance and effect. The ordinary manprefers easy ways so long as they may be followed, and is almost wilfullyheedless whether they end at last in a cul-de-sac. Finding the stream of eventstoo powerful to control at once, the generality of philosophical teachersdrifted in those days from the scheming of model cities and the planning of newways of living into the elaboration of beautiful and consoling systems ofevasion.Perhaps that is putting things coarsely and unjustly. But let Professor GilbertMurray speak upon this matter.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en89]“The Cynics cared only for virtue and the relation of the soul to God; the worldand its learning and its honours were as dross to them. The Stoics andEpicureans, so far apart at first sight, were very similar in their ultimateaim. What they really cared about was ethics—the practical question how a manshould order his life. Both, indeed, gave themselves to some science—theEpicureans to physics, the Stoics to logic and rhetoric—but only as a means toan end. The Stoic tried to win men’s hearts and convictions by sheer subtlety ofabstract argument and dazzling sublimity of thought and expression. TheEpicurean was determined to make Humanity go its way without cringing tocapricious gods and without sacrificing Free Will.” He condensed his gospel intofour maxims: “God is not to be feared; Death cannot be felt; the Good can bewon; all that we dread can be borne and conquered.”And meanwhile the stream of events flowed on, with a reciprocal indifference tophilosophy.§ 6If the Greek classics are to be read with any benefit by modern men, they mustbe read as the work of men like ourselves. Regard must be had to theirtraditions, their opportunities, and their limitations. There is a dispositionto exaggeration in all human admiration; most of our classical texts are verymuch mangled, and all were originally the work of human beings in difficulties,living in a time of such darkness and narrowness of outlook as makes our own ageby comparison a period of dazzling illumination. What we shall lose in reverenceby this familiar treatment, we shall gain in sympathy for that group oftroubled, uncertain, and very modern minds. The Athenian writers were, indeed,the first of modern men. They were discussing questions that we still discuss;they began to struggle with the great problems that confront us today. Theirwritings are our dawn.7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en90]They began an inquiry, and they arrived at no solutions. We cannot pretend todaythat we have arrived at solutions to most of the questions they asked. The mindof the Hebrews, as we have already shown, awoke suddenly to the endless miseriesand disorders of life, saw that these miseries and disorders were largely due tothe lawless acts of men, and concluded that salvation could come only throughsubduing ourselves to the service of the one God who rules heaven and earth. TheGreek, rising to the same perception, was not prepared with the same idea of apatriarchal deity; he lived in a world in which there was not God but the gods;if perhaps he felt that the gods themselves were limited, then he thought ofFate behind them, cold and impersonal. So he put his problem in the form of aninquiry as to what was right living, without any definite correlation of theright-living man with the will of God. . . . To us, looking at the matter from astandpoint purely historical, the common problem can now be presented in a formthat, for the purposes of history, covers both the Hebrew and Greek way ofputting it. We have seen our kind rising out of the unconsciousness of animalsto a continuing racial self-consciousness, realizing the unhappiness of its wilddiversity of aims, realizing the inevitable tragedy of individual self-seeking,and feeling its way blindly towards some linking and subordinating idea to saveit from the pains and accidents of mere individuality. The gods, the god-king,the idea of the tribe, the idea of the city; here are ideas that have claimedand held for a time the devotion of men, ideas in which they have a little losttheir individual selfishness and escaped to the realization of a more enduringlife. Yet, as our wars and disasters prove, none of these greater ideas have yetbeen great enough. The gods have failed to protect, the tribe has proved itselfvile and cruel, the city ostracized one’s best and truest friends, the god-kingmade a beast of himself. . . .As we read over the speculative literature of this great period of the Greeks,we realize three barriers set about the Greek mind, from which it rarelyescaped, but from which we now perhaps are beginning to escape.The first of these limitations was the obsession of the Greek mind by the ideaof the city as the ultimate state. In a world in which empire had followedempire, each greater than its predecessor, in a world through which men andideas drove ever more loosely and freely, in a world visibly unifying even then,the Greeks, because of their peculiar physical and political circumstances, werestill dreaming impossibly of a compact little city state, impervious to outerinfluences, valiantly secure against the whole world. Plato’s estimate of thenumber of citizens in a perfect state varied between one thousand (the Republic)and 5040 (the Laws) citizens.8 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en91] Thisstate was to go to war and hold its own against other cities of the same size.And this was not a couple of generations after the hosts of Xerxes had crossedthe Hellespont!Perhaps these Greeks thought the day of world empires had passed forever,whereas it was only beginning. At the utmost their minds reached out toalliances and leagues. There must have been men at the court of Artaxerxesthinking far away beyond these little ideas of the rocky creek, the island, andthe mountain-encircled valley. But the need for unification against the greaterpowers that moved outside the Greek-speaking world, the Greek mind disregardedwilfully. These outsiders were barbarians, not to be needlessly thought about;they were barred out now from Greece forever. One took Persian money; everybodytook Persian money; what did it matter? Or one enlisted for a time in theirarmies (as Xenophon did) and hoped for his luck with a rich prisoner. Athenstook sides in Egyptian affairs, and carried on minor wars with Persia, but therewas no conception of a common policy or a common future for Greece. . . . Untilat last a voice in Athens began to shout “Macedonia!” to clamour like awatchdog, “Macedonia!” This was the voice of the orator and demagogue,Demosthenes, hurling warnings and threats and denunciations at King Philip ofMacedon, who had learnt his politics not only from Plato and Aristotle, but alsofrom Isocrates and Xenophon, and from Babylon and Susa, and who was preparingquietly, ably, and steadfastly to dominate all Greece, and through Greece toconquer the known world. . . .There was a second thing that cramped the Greek mind, the institution ofdomestic slavery. Slavery was implicit in Greek life; men could conceive ofneither comfort nor dignity without it. But slavery shuts off one’s sympathy notonly from a class of one’s fellow subjects; it puts the slave-owner into a classand organization against all stranger men. One is of an elect tribe. Plato,carried by his clear reason and the noble sanity of his spirit beyond the thingsof the present, would have abolished slavery; much popular feeling and the NewComedy were against it; the Stoics and Epicureans, many of whom were slaves,condemned it as unnatural, but finding it too strong to upset, decided that itdid not affect the soul and might be ignored. With the wise there was no boundor free. To the matter-of-fact Aristotle, and probably to most practical men,its abolition was inconceivable. So they declared that there were in the worldmen “naturally slaves. . . .”Finally, the thought of the Greeks was hampered by a want of knowledge that isalmost inconceivable to us today. They had no knowledge of the past of mankindat all; at best they had a few shrewd guesses. They had no knowledge ofgeography beyond the range of the Mediterranean basin and the frontiers ofPersia. We know far more today of what was going on in Susa, Persepolis,Babylon, and Memphis in the time of Pericles than he did. Their astronomicalideas were still in the state of rudimentary speculations. Anaxagoras, greatlydaring, thought the sun and moon were vast globes, so vast that the sun wasprobably “as big as all the Peloponnesus.” Their ideas in physics and chemistrywere the results of profound cogitation; it is wonderful that they did guess atatomic structure. One has to remember their extraordinary poverty in the matterof experimental apparatus. They had coloured glass for ornament, but no whiteglass; no accurate means of measuring the minor intervals of time, no reallyefficient numerical notation, no very accurate scales, no rudiments of telescopeor microscope. A modern scientific man dumped down in the Athens of Pericleswould have found the utmost difficulty in demonstrating the elements of hisknowledge, however crudely, to the men he would have found there. He would havehad to rig up the simplest apparatus under every disadvantage, while Socratespointed out the absurdity of seeking Truth with pieces of wood and string andmetal such as small boys use for fishing. And our professor of science wouldalso have been in constant danger of a prosecution for impiety.Our world today draws upon relatively immense accumulations of knowledge offact. In the age of Pericles scarcely the first stone of our comparativelytremendous cairn of things recorded and proved had been put in place. When wereflect upon this difference, then it ceases to be remarkable that the Greeks,with all their aptitude for political speculation, were blind to theinsecurities of their civilization from without and from within, to thenecessity for effective unification, to the swift rush of events that was to endfor long ages these first brief freedoms of the human mind.It is not in the results it achieved, but in the attempts it made, that the truevalue for us of this group of Greek talkers and writers lies. It is not thatthey answered questions, but that they dared to ask them. Never before had manchallenged his world and the way of life to which he found his birth had broughthim. Never had he said before that he could alter his conditions. Tradition anda seeming necessity had held him to life as he had found it grown up about histribe since time immemorial. Hitherto he had taken the world as children stilltake the homes and habits in which they have been reared.So in the fifth and fourth centuries BC we perceive, most plainly in Judea andin Athens, but by no means confined to those centres, the beginnings of a moraland an intellectual process in mankind, an appeal to righteousness and an appealto the truth from the passions and confusions and immediate appearances ofexistence. It is like the dawn of the sense of responsibility in a youth, whosuddenly discovers that life is neither easy nor aimless. Mankind is growing up.The rest of history for three and twenty centuries is threaded with thespreading out and development and interaction and the clearer and more effectivestatement of these main leading ideas. Slowly more and more men apprehend thereality of human brotherhood, the needlessness of wars and cruelties andoppression, the possibilities of a common purpose for the whole of our kind. Inevery generation thereafter there is the evidence of men seeking for that betterorder to which they feel our world must come. But everywhere and wherever in anyman the great constructive ideas have taken hold, the hot greeds, thejealousies, the suspicions and impatience that are in the nature of everyone ofus, war against the struggle towards greater and broader purposes. The lasttwenty-three centuries of history are like the efforts of some impulsive, hastyimmortal to think clearly and live rightly. Blunder follows blunder; promisingbeginnings end in grotesque disappointments; streams of living water arepoisoned by the cup that conveys them to the thirsty lips of mankind. But thehope of men rises again at last after every disaster. . . .We pass on now to the story of one futile commencement, one glorious shatteredbeginning of human unity. There was in Alexander the Great knowledge andimagination, power and opportunity, folly, egotism, detestable vulgarity, and animmense promise broken by the accident of his early death while men were stilldazzled by its immensity."},{"pageContent":"121 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_121_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE 122[bano_9781411428843_oeb_122_r1.gif]THE CAREER OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT§ 1.

PERGAMUM A REFUGE OF CULTURE. § 8.ALEXANDER AS A PORTENT OF WORLD UNITY.§ 1THE TRUE HERO OF THE STORY OF ALEXANDER IS NOT SO MUCH ALEXANDER as his fatherPhilip. The author of a piece does not shine in the limelight as the actor does,and it was Philip who planned much of the greatness that his son achieved, wholaid the foundations and forged the tools, who had indeed already begun thePersian expedition at the time of his death. Philip, beyond doubting, was one ofthe greatest monarchs the world has ever seen; he was a man of the utmostintelligence and ability, and his range of ideas was vastly beyond the scope ofhis time. He made Aristotle his friend; he must have discussed with him thoseschemes for the organization of real knowledge which the philosopher was torealize later through Alexander’s endowments. Philip, so far as we can judge,seems to have been Aristotle’s “Prince”; to him Aristotle turned as men turnonly to those whom they admire and trust. To Philip also Isocrates appealed asthe great leader who should unify and ennoble the chaotic public life of Greece.In many books it is stated that Philip was a man of incredible cynicism and ofuncontrolled lusts. It is true that at feasts, like all the Macedonians of histime, he was a hard drinker and sometimes drunken—it was probably consideredunamiable not to drink excessively at feasts; but of the other accusations thereis no real proof, and for evidence we have only the railings of such antagonistsas Demosthenes, the Athenian demagogue and orator, a man of reckless rhetoric.The quotation of a phrase or so will serve to show to what the patriotic angerof Demosthenes could bring him. In one of the Philippics, as his denunciationsof Philip are called, he gives vent in this style:“Philip—a man who not only is no Greek, and no way akin to the Greeks, but isnot even a barbarian from a respectable country—no, a pestilent fellow ofMacedon, a country from which we never get even a decent slave.” And so on andso on. We know, as a matter of fact, that the Macedonians were an Aryan peoplevery closely akin to the Greeks, and that Philip was probably the best educatedman of his time. This was the spirit in which the adverse accounts of Philipwere written.123 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_123_r1.gif]When Philip became king of Macedonia in 359 BC, his country was a little countrywithout a seaport or industries or any considerable city. It had a peasantpopulation, Greek almost in language and ready to be Greek in sympathies, butmore purely Nordic in blood than any people to the south of it. Philip made thislittle barbaric state into a great one; he created the most efficient militaryorganization the world had so far seen, and he had brought most of Greece intoone confederacy under his leadership at the time of his death. And hisextraordinary quality, his power of thinking out beyond the current ideas of histime, is shown not so much in those matters as in the care with which he had hisson trained to carry on the policy he had created. He is one of the few monarchsin history who cared for his successor. Alexander was, as few other monarchshave ever been, a specially educated king; he was educated for empire. Aristotlewas but one of the several able tutors his father chose for him. Philip confidedhis policy to him, and entrusted him with commands and authority by the time hewas sixteen. He commanded the cavalry at Chæronea under his father’s eye. He wasnursed into power—generously and unsuspiciously.To anyone who reads his life with care it is evident that Alexander started withan equipment of training and ideas of unprecedented value. As he got beyond thewisdom of his upbringing he began to blunder and misbehave—sometimes with adreadful folly. The defects of his character had triumphed over his upbringinglong before he died.Philip was a king after the old pattern, a leader-king, first among his peers,of the ancient Nordic Aryan type. The army he found in Macedonia consisted of ageneral foot levy and a noble equestrian order called the “companions.” Thepeople were farmers and hunters and somewhat drunken in their habits, but readyfor discipline and good fighting stuff. And if the people were homely, thegovernment was intelligent and alert. For some generations the court languagehad been Attic (== Athenian) Greek, and the court had been sufficientlycivilized to shelter and entertain such great figures as Euripides, who diedthere in 406 BC, and Zeuxis the artist. Moreover, Philip, before his accession,had spent some years as a hostage in Greece. He had had as good an education asGreece could give at that time. He was, therefore, quite familiar with what wemay call the idea of Isocrates—the idea of a great union of the Greek states inEurope to dominate the Eastern world; and he knew, too, how incapable was theAthenian democracy, because of its constitution and tradition, of taking theopportunity that lay before it. For it was an opportunity that would have to beshared. To the Athenians or the Spartans it would mean letting in a “lot offoreigners” to the advantages of citizenship. It would mean lowering themselvesto the level of equality and fellowship with Macedonians—a people from whom “we”do not get “even a decent slave.”There was no way to secure unanimity among the Greeks for the contemplatedenterprise except by some revolutionary political action. It was no love ofpeace that kept the Greeks from such an adventure; it was their politicaldivisions. The resources of the several states were exhausted in a series ofinternecine wars—wars arising out of the merest excuses and fanned by oratoricalwind. The ploughing of certain sacred lands near Delphi by the Phocians was, forexample, the pretext for a sanguinary Sacred War.124 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_124_r1.gif]Philip’s first years of kingship were devoted to the discipline of his army.Hitherto most of the main battle fighting in the world had been done by footmenin formation. In the very ancient Sumerian battle-pieces we see spearmen inclose order forming the main battle, just as they did in the Zulu armies of thenineteenth century; the Greek troops of Philip’s time were still fighting inthat same style; the Theban phalanx was a mass of infantry holding spears, thehinder ranks thrusting their longer spears between the frontline men. Such aformation went through anything less disciplined that opposed it. Mountedarchers could, of course, inflict considerable losses on such a mass of men, andaccordingly, as the horse came into warfare, horsemen appeared on either side asan accessory to this main battle. The reader must remember that the horse didnot come into very effective use in western war until the rise of the Assyrians,and then at first only as a chariot horse. The chariots drove full tilt at theinfantry mass and tried to break it. Unless its discipline was very solid theysucceeded. The Homeric fighting is chariot fighting. It is not until the lastthousand years BC that we begin to find mounted soldiers, as distinct fromcharioteers, playing a part in warfare. At first they appear to have fought in ascattered fashion, each man doing his personal feats. So the Lydians foughtagainst Cyrus. It was Philip who seems to have created charging cavalry. Hecaused his “companions” to drill for a massed charge. And also he strengthenedhis phalanx by giving the rear men longer spears than had been used hitherto,and so deepening its mass. The Macedonian phalanx was merely a more solidversion of the Theban phalanx. None of these massed infantry formations wasflexible enough to stand a flank or rear attack. They had very slight manœuvringpower. Both Philip’s and his son’s victories followed, therefore, withvariations, one general scheme of cooperation between these two arms. Thephalanx advanced in the centre and held the enemy’s main body; on one wing orthe other the cavalry charges swept away the enemy cavalry, and then swoopedround upon the flank and rear of the enemy phalanx, the front of which theMacedonian phalanx was already smiting. The enemy main battle then broke and wasmassacred. As Alexander’s military experience grew, he also added a use ofcatapults in the field, big stone-throwing affairs, to break up the enemyinfantry. Before his time catapults had been used in sieges, but never inbattles. He invented “artillery preparation.”With the weapon of his new army in his hand, Philip first turned his attentionto the north of Macedonia. He carried expeditions into Illyria and as far as theDanube; he also spread his power along the coast as far as the Hellespont. Hesecured possession of a port, Amphipolis, and certain gold mines adjacent. Afterseveral Thracian expeditions he turned southward in good earnest. He took up thecause of the Delphic amphictyony against those sacrilegious Phocians, and soappeared as the champion of Hellenic religion.There was a strong party of Greeks, it must be understood, a Pan-Hellenic party,in favour of the Greek headship of Philip. The chief writer of this Pan-Hellenicmovement was Isocrates. Athens, on the other hand, was the head and front of theopposition to Philip, and Athens was in open sympathy with Persia, even sendingemissaries to the Great King to warn him of the danger to him of a unitedGreece. The comings and goings of twelve years cannot be related here. In 338 BCthe long struggle between division and pan-Hellenism came to a decisive issue,and at the battle of Chæronea Philip inflicted a crushing defeat upon Athens andher allies. He gave Athens peace upon astonishingly generous terms; he displayedhimself steadfastly resolved to propitiate and favour that implacable city; andin 338 BC a congress of Greek states recognized him as captain-general for thewar against Persia.He was now a man of forty-seven. It seemed as though the world lay at his feet.He had made his little country into the leading state in a greatGræco-Macedonian confederacy. That unification was to be the prelude to a stillgreater one, the unification of the Western world with the Persian empire intoone world state of all known peoples. Who can doubt he had that dream? Thewritings of Isocrates convince us that he had it. Who can deny that he mighthave realized it? He had a reasonable hope of living for perhaps another quartercentury of activity. In 336 BC his advanced guard crossed into Asia. . . .But he never followed with his main force. He was assassinated.§ 2It is necessary now to tell something of the domestic life of King Philip. Thelives of both Philip and his son were pervaded by the personality of a restlessand evil woman, Olympias, the mother of Alexander.She was the daughter of the king of Epirus, a country to the west of Macedonia,and, like Macedonia, a semi-Greek land. She met Philip, or was thrown in hisway, at some religious gathering in Samothrace. Plutarch declares the marriagewas a love-match, and there seems to be at least this much in the chargesagainst Philip that, like many energetic and imaginative men, he was prone toimpatient love impulses. He married her when he was already a king, andAlexander was born to him three years later.125 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_125_r1.gif]It was not long before Olympias and Philip were bitterly estranged. She wasjealous of him, but there was another and graver source of trouble in herpassion for religious mysteries. We have already noted that beneath the fine andrestrained Nordic religion of the Greeks the land abounded with religious cultsof a darker and more ancient kind, aboriginal cults with secret initiations,orgiastic celebrations, and often with cruel and obscene rites. These religionsof the shadows, these practices of the women and peasants and slaves, gaveGreece her Orphic, Dionysic, and Demeter cults; they have lurked in thetradition of Europe down almost to our own times. The witchcraft of the MiddleAges, with its resort to the blood of babes, scraps of executed criminals,incantations and magic circles, seems to have been little else than thelingering vestiges of these solemnities of the dark whites. In these mattersOlympias was an expert and an enthusiast, and Plutarch mentions that sheachieved considerable celebrity by use of tame serpents in these piousexercises. The snakes invaded her domestic apartments, and history is not clearwhether Philip found in them matter for exasperation or religious awe. Theseoccupations of his wife must have been a serious inconvenience to Philip, forthe Macedonian people were still in that sturdy stage of social development inwhich neither enthusiastic religiosity nor uncontrollable wives are admired.The evidence of a bitter hostility between mother and father peeps out in manylittle things in the histories. She was evidently jealous of Philip’s conquests;she hated his fame. There are many signs that Olympias did her best to set herson against his father and attach him wholly to herself. A story survives (inPlutarch’s Life) that “whenever news was brought of Philip’s victories, thecapture of a city or the winning of some great battle, he never seemed greatlyrejoiced to hear it; on the contrary he used to say to his play-fellows: ‘Fatherwill get everything in advance, boys; he won’t leave any great task for me toshare with you. . . .’”It is not a natural thing for a boy to envy his father in this fashion withoutsome inspiration. That sentence sounds like an echo.We have already pointed out how manifest it is that Philip planned thesuccession of Alexander, and how eager he was to thrust fame and power into theboy’s hands. He was thinking of the political structure he was building—but themother was thinking of the glory and pride of that wonderful lady, Olympias. Shemasked her hatred of her husband under the cloak of a mother’s solicitude forher son’s future. When in 337 BC Philip, after the fashion of kings in thosedays, married a second wife who was a native Macedonian, Cleopatra, “of whom hewas passionately enamoured,” Olympias made much trouble.Plutarch tells of a pitiful scene that occurred at Philip’s marriage toCleopatra. There was much drinking of wine at the banquet, and Attalus, thefather of the bride, being “intoxicated with liquor,” betrayed the generalhostility to Olympias and Epirus by saying he hoped there would be a child bythe marriage to give them a truly Macedonian heir. Whereupon Alexander, taut forsuch an insult, cried out, “What then am I?” and hurled his cup at Attalus.Philip, enraged, stood up and, says Plutarch, drew his sword, only to stumbleand fall. Alexander, blind with rage and jealousy, taunted and insulted hisfather.“Macedonians,” he said. “See there the general who would go from Europe to Asia!Why! He cannot get from one table to another!”How that scene lives still, the sprawl, the flushed faces, the angry voice ofthe boy! Next day Alexander departed with his mother—and Philip did nothing torestrain them. Olympias went home to Epirus; Alexander departed to Illyria.Thence Philip persuaded him to return.Fresh trouble arose. Alexander had a brother of weak intellect, Aridæus, whomthe Persian governor of Caria sought as a son-in-law.Alexander’s friends and his mother now infused notions into him again, thoughperfectly groundless, that by so noble a match, and the support consequent uponit, Philip designed the crown for Aridæus. Alexander, in the uneasiness thesesuspicions gave him, sent one Thessalus, a player, into Caria, to desire thegrandee to pass by Aridæus, who was of spurious birth, and deficient in point ofunderstanding, and to take the lawful heir to the crown into his alliance.Pixodarus was infinitely more pleased with this proposal. But Philip no soonerhad intelligence of it, than he went to Alexander’s apartment, taking along withhim Philotas, the son of Parmenio, one of his most intimate friends andcompanions, and, in his presence, reproached him with his degeneracy andmeanness of spirit, in thinking of being son-in-law to a man of Caria, one ofthe slaves of a barbarian king. At the same time he wrote to the Corinthians,insisting that they should send Thessalus to him in chains. Harpalus andNiarchus, Phrygius and Ptolemy, some of the other companions of the prince, hebanished. But Alexander afterwards recalled them, and treated them with greatdistinction.There is something very touching in this story of the father pleading with theson he manifestly loved, and baffled by the web of mean suggestion which hadbeen spun about the boy’s imagination.It was at the marriage of his daughter to her uncle, the king of Epirus and thebrother of Olympias, that Philip was stabbed. He was walking in a processioninto the theatre unarmed, in a white robe, and he was cut down by one of hisbodyguard. The murderer had a horse waiting, and would have got away, but thefoot of his horse caught in a wild vine and he was thrown from the saddle by thestumble and slain by his pursuers. . . .So at the age of twenty Alexander was at the end of his anxiety about thesuccession, and established king in Macedonia.Olympias then reappeared in Macedonia, a woman proudly vindicated. It is saidthat she insisted upon paying the same funeral honours to the memory of themurderer as to Philip.In Greece there were great rejoicings over this auspicious event, andDemosthenes, when he had the news, although it was but seven days after thedeath of his own daughter, went into the public assembly at Athens in gay attirewearing a chaplet.Whatever Olympias may have done about her husband’s assassin, history does notdoubt about her treatment of her supplanter, Cleopatra. So soon as Alexander wasout of the way—and a revolt of the hillmen in the north called at once for hisattention—Cleopatra’s newly born child was killed in its mother’s arms, andCleopatra—no doubt after a little taunting—was then strangled. These excesses ofwomanly feeling are said to have shocked Alexander, but they did not prevent himfrom leaving his mother in a position of considerable authority in Macedonia.She wrote letters to him upon religious and political questions, and he showed adutiful disposition in sending her always a large share of the plunder he made.§ 3These stories have to be told because history cannot be understood without them.Here was the great world of men between India and the Adriatic ready for union,ready as it had never been before for a unifying control. Here was the wideorder of the Persian empire with its roads, its posts, its general peace andprosperity, ripe for the fertilizing influence of the Greek mind. And thesestories display the quality of the human beings to whom those greatopportunities came. Here was this Philip who was a very great and noble man, andyet he was drunken, he could keep no order in his household. Here was Alexanderin many ways gifted above any man of his time, and he was vain, suspicious, andpassionate, with a mind set awry by his mother.We are beginning to understand something of what the world might be, somethingof what our race might become, were it not for our still raw humanity. It isbarely a matter of seventy generations between ourselves and Alexander; andbetween ourselves and the savage hunters, our ancestors, who charred their foodin the embers or ate it raw, intervene some four or five hundred generations.There is not much scope for the modification of a species in four or fivehundred generations. Make men and women only sufficiently jealous or fearful ordrunken or angry, and the hot red eyes of the cavemen will glare out at ustoday. We have writing and teaching, science and power; we have tamed the beastsand schooled the lightning; but we are still only shambling towards the light.We have tamed and bred the beasts, but we have still to tame and breedourselves.From the very beginning of his reign the deeds of Alexander showed how well hehad assimilated his father’s plans, and how great were his own abilities. A mapof the known world is needed to show the course of his life. At first, afterreceiving assurances from Greece that he was to be captain-general of theGrecian forces, he marched through Thrace to the Danube; he crossed the riverand burnt a village, the second great monarch to raid the Scythian countrybeyond the Danube; then recrossed it and marched westward and so came down byIllyria. By that time the city of Thebes was in rebellion, and his next blow wasat Greece. Thebes—unsupported of course by Athens—was taken and looted; it wastreated with extravagant violence; all its buildings, except the temple and thehouse of the poet Pindar, were razed, and thirty thousand people sold intoslavery. Greece was stunned, and Alexander was free to go on with the Persian,campaign.This destruction of Thebes betrayed a streak of violence in the new master ofhuman destinies. It was too heavy a blow to have dealt. It was a barbaric thingto do. If the spirit of rebellion was killed, so also was the spirit of help.The Greek states remained inert thereafter, neither troublesome nor helpful.They would not support Alexander with their shipping, a thing which was to provea very grave embarrassment to him.There is a story told by Plutarch about this Theban massacre, as if it redoundedto the credit of Alexander, but indeed it shows only how his saner and his crazysides were in conflict. It tells of a Macedonian officer and a Theban lady. Thisofficer was among the looters, and he entered this woman’s house, inflictedunspeakable insults and injuries upon her, and at last demanded whether she hadgold or silver hidden. She told him all her treasures had been put into thewell, conducted him thither, and, as he stooped to peer down, pushed himsuddenly in and killed him by throwing great stones upon him. Some alliedsoldiers came upon this scene and took her forthwith to Alexander for judgment.She defied him. Already the extravagant impulse that had ordered the massacrewas upon the wane, and he not only spared her, but had her family and propertyand freedom restored to her. This Plutarch makes out to be a generosity, but theissue is more complicated than that. It was Alexander who was outraging andplundering and enslaving all Thebes. That poor crumpled Macedonian brute in thewell had been doing only what he had been told he had full liberty to do. Is acommander first to give cruel orders, and then to forgive and reward those whoslay his instruments? This gleam of remorse at the instance of one woman who wasnot perhaps wanting in tragic dignity and beauty, is a poor set-off to themurder of a great city.Mixed with the craziness of Olympias in Alexander was the sanity of Philip andthe teachings of Aristotle. This Theban business certainly troubled the mind ofAlexander. Whenever afterwards he encountered Thebans, he tried to show themspecial favour. Thebes, to his credit, haunted him.Yet the memory of Thebes did not save three other great cities from similarbrain storms; Tyre he destroyed, and Gaza, and a city in India, in the stormingof which he was knocked down in fair fight and wounded; and of the latter placenot a soul, not a child, was spared. He must have been badly frightened to havetaken so evil a revenge.At the outset of the war the Persians had this supreme advantage, they werepractically masters of the sea. The ships of the Athenians and their alliessulked unhelpfully. Alexander, to get at Asia, had to go round by theHellespont; and if he pushed far into the Persian empire, he ran the risk ofbeing cut off completely from his base. His first task, therefore, was tocripple the enemy at sea, and this he could only do by marching along the coastof Asia Minor and capturing port after port until the Persian sea bases weredestroyed. If the Persians had avoided battle and hung upon his lengthening lineof communications they could probably have destroyed him, but this they did notdo. A Persian army not very much greater than his own gave battle on the banksof the Granicus (334 BC) and was destroyed. This left him free to take Sardis,Ephesus, Miletus, and, after a fierce struggle, Halicarnassus. Meanwhile thePersian fleet was on his right flank and between him and Greece, threateningmuch but accomplishing nothing.In 333 BC, pursuing this attack upon the sea bases, he marched along the coastas far as the head of the gulf now called the Gulf of Alexandretta. A hugePersian army, under the great king Darius III, was inland of his line of march,separated from the coast by mountains, and Alexander went right beyond thisenemy force before he or the Persians realized their proximity. Scouting wasevidently very badly done by Greek and Persian alike. The Persian army was avast, ill-organized assembly of soldiers, transport, camp followers, and soforth. Darius, for instance, was accompanied by his harem, and there was a greatmultitude of harem slaves, musicians, dancers, and cooks. Many of the leadingofficers had brought their families to witness the hunting down of theMacedonian invaders. The troops had been levied from every province in theempire; they had no tradition or principle of combined action. Seized by theidea of cutting off Alexander from Greece, Darius moved this multitude over themountains to the sea; he had the luck to get through the passes withoutopposition, and he encamped on the plain of Issus between the mountains and theshore. And there Alexander, who had turned back to fight, struck him. Thecavalry charge and the phalanx smashed this great brittle host as a stonesmashes a bottle. It was routed. Darius escaped from his war chariot—thatout-of-date instrument—and fled on horseback, leaving even his harem in thehands of Alexander.All the accounts of Alexander after this battle show him at his best. He wasrestrained and magnanimous. He treated the Persian princesses with the utmostcivility. And he kept his head; he held steadfastly to his plan. He let Dariusescape, unpursued, into Syria, and he continued his march upon the naval basesof the Persians—that is to say, upon the Phœnician ports of Tyre and Sidon.Sidon surrendered to him; Tyre resisted.Here, if anywhere, we have the evidence of great military ability on the part ofAlexander. His army was his father’s creation, but Philip had never shone in thesiege of cities. When Alexander was a boy of sixteen, he had seen his fatherrepulsed by the fortified city of Byzantium upon the Bosphorus. Now he was faceto face with an inviolate city which had stood siege after siege, which hadresisted Nebuchadnezzar the Great for fourteen years. For the standing of siegesSemitic peoples hold the palm. Tyre was then an island half a mile from theshore, and her fleet was unbeaten. On the other hand, Alexander had alreadylearnt much by the siege of the citadel of Halicarnassus; he had gathered tohimself a corps of engineers from Cyprus and Phœnicia, the Sidonian fleet waswith him, and presently the king of Cyprus came over to him with a hundred andtwenty ships, which gave him the command of the sea. Moreover, great Carthage,either relying on the strength of the mother city or being disloyal to her, andbeing furthermore entangled in a war in Sicily, sent no help.126 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_126_r1.gif]The first measure of Alexander was to build a pier from the mainland to theisland, a dam which remains to this day; and on this, as it came close to thewalls of Tyre, he set up his towers and battering-rams. Against the walls healso moored ships in which towers and rams were erected. The Tyrians usedfire-ships against this flotilla, and made sorties from their two harbours. In abig surprise raid that they made on the Cyprian ships they were caught and badlymauled; many of their ships were rammed, and one big galley of five banks ofoars and one of four were captured outright. Finally a breach in the walls wasmade, and the Macedonians, clambering up the debris from their ships, stormedthe city.The siege had lasted seven months. Gaza held out for two. In each case there wasa massacre, the plundering of the city, and the selling of the survivors intoslavery. Then towards the end of 332 BC Alexander entered Egypt, and the commandof the sea was assured. Greece, which all this while had been wavering in itspolicy, decided now at last that it was on the side of Alexander, and thecouncil of the Greek states at Corinth voted its “captain-general” a goldencrown of victory. From this time onward the Greeks were with the Macedonians.The Egyptians also were with the Macedonians. But they had been for Alexanderfrom the beginning. They had lived under Persian rule for nearly two hundredyears, and the coming of Alexander meant for them only a change of masters; onthe whole, a change for the better. The country surrendered without a blow.Alexander treated its religious feelings with extreme respect. He unwrapped nomummies as Cambyses had done; he took no liberties with Apis, the sacred bull ofMemphis. Here, in great temples and upon a vast scale, Alexander found theevidences of a religiosity, mysterious and irrational, to remind him of thesecrets and mysteries that had entertained his mother and impressed hischildhood. During his four months in Egypt he flirted with religious emotions.He was still a very young man, we must remember, divided against himself. Thestrong sanity he inherited from his father had made him a great soldier; theteaching of Aristotle had given him something of the scientific outlook upon theworld. He had destroyed Tyre; in Egypt, at one of the mouths of the Nile, he nowfounded a new city, Alexandria, to replace that ancient centre of trade. To thenorth of Tyre, near Issus, he founded a second port, Alexandretta. Both of thesecities flourish to this day, and for a time Alexandria was perhaps the greatestcity in the world. The sites, therefore, must have been wisely chosen. But alsoAlexander had the unstable emotional imaginativeness of his mother, and side byside with such creative work he indulged in religious adventures. The gods ofEgypt took possession of his mind. He travelled four hundred miles to the remoteoasis of the oracle of Ammon. He wanted to settle certain doubts about his trueparentage. His mother had inflamed his mind by hints and vague speeches of somedeep mystery about his parentage. Was so ordinary a human being as Philip ofMacedon really his rather?For nearly four hundred years Egypt had been a country politically contemptible,overrun now by Ethiopians, now by Assyrians, now by Babylonians, now byPersians. As the indignities of the present became more and more disagreeable tocontemplate, the past and the other world became more splendid to Egyptian eyes.It is from the festering humiliations of peoples that arrogant religiouspropagandas spring. To the triumphant the downtrodden can say, “It is naught inthe sight of the true gods.” So the son of Philip of Macedon, the master-generalof Greece, was made to feel a small person amidst the gigantic temples. And hehad an abnormal share of youth’s normal ambition to impress everybody. Howgratifying then for him to discover presently that he was no mere successfulmortal, not one of these modern vulgar Greekish folk, but ancient and divine,the son of a god, the Pharaoh god, son of Ammon Ra!Already in a previous chapter we have given a description of that encounter inthe desert temple.Not altogether was the young man convinced. He had his moments of conviction; hehad his saner phases when the thing was almost a jest. In the presence ofMacedonians and Greeks he doubted if he was divine. When it thundered loudly,the ribald Aristarchus could ask him: “Won’t you do something of the sort, ohSon of Zeus?” But the crazy notion was, nevertheless, present henceforth in hisbrain, ready to be inflamed by wine or flattery.Next spring (331 BC) he returned to Tyre, and marched thence round towardsAssyria, leaving the Syrian desert on his right. Near the ruins of forgottenNineveh he found a great Persian army, that had been gathering since the battleof Issus, awaiting him. It was another huge medley of contingents, and it reliedfor its chief force upon that now antiquated weapon, the war chariot. Of theseDarius had a force of two hundred, and each chariot had scythes attached to itswheels and to the pole and body of the chariot. There seem to have been fourhorses to each chariot, and it will be obvious that if one of those horses waswounded by javelin or arrow, that chariot was held up. The outer horses actedchiefly as buffers for the inner wheel horses; they were hitched to the chariotby a single outside trace which could be easily cut away, but the loss of one ofthe wheel horses completely incapacitated the whole affair. Against brokenfootmen or a crowd of individualist fighters such vehicles might be formidable;but Darius began the battle by flinging them against the cavalry and lightinfantry. Few reached their objective, and those that did were readily disposedof. There was some manœuvring for position. The well-drilled Macedonians movedobliquely across the Persian front, keeping good order; the Persians, followingthis movement to the flank, opened gaps in their array. Then suddenly thedisciplined Macedonian cavalry charged at one of these torn places and smote thecentre of the Persian host. The infantry followed close upon their charge. Thecentre and left of the Persians crumpled up. For a while the light cavalry onthe Persian right gained ground against Alexander’s left, only to be cut topieces by the cavalry from Thessaly, which by this time had become almost asgood as its Macedonian model. The Persian forces ceased to resemble an army.They dissolved into a vast multitude of fugitives streaming under great dustclouds and without a single rally across the hot plain towards Arbela. Throughthe dust and the flying crowd rode the victors, slaying and slaying untildarkness stayed the slaughter. Darius led the retreat.Such was the battle of Arbela. It was fought on October the 1st, 331 BC. We knowits date so exactly, because it is recorded that, eleven days before it began,the soothsayers on both sides had been greatly exercised by an eclipse of themoon.Darius fled to the north into the country of the Medes. Alexander marched on toBabylon. The ancient city of Hammurabi (who had reigned seventeen hundred yearsbefore) and of Nebuchadnezzar the Great and of Nabonidus was still, unlikeNineveh, a prosperous and important centre. Like the Egyptians, the Babylonianswere not greatly concerned at a change of rule to Macedonian from Persian. Thetemple of Bel-Marduk was in ruins, a quarry for building material, but thetradition of the Chaldean priests still lingered, and Alexander promised torestore the building.Thence he marched on to Susa, once the chief city of the vanished and forgottenElamites, and now the Persian capital.He went on to Persepolis, where, as the climax of a drunken carouse, he burntdown the great palace of the king of kings. This he afterwards declared was therevenge of Greece for the burning of Athens by Xerxes.§ 4And now begins a new phase in the story of Alexander. For the next seven yearshe wandered with an army chiefly of Macedonians in the north and east of whatwas then the known world. At first it was a pursuit of Darius. Afterwards itbecame——? Was it a systematic survey of a world he meant to consolidate into onegreat order, or was it a wild-goose chase? His own soldiers his own intimates,thought the latter, and at last stayed his career beyond the Indus. On the mapit looks very like a wild-goose chase; it seems to aim at nothing in particularand to get nowhere.The pursuit of Darius III soon came to a pitiful end. After the battle of Arbelahis own generals seem to have revolted against his weakness and incompetence;they made him a prisoner, and took him with them in spite of his desire to throwhimself upon the generosity of his conqueror. Bessus, the satrap of Bactria,they made their leader. There was at last a hot and exciting chase of the flyingcaravan which conveyed the captive king of kings. At dawn, after an all-nightpursuit, it was sighted far ahead. The flight became a headlong bolt. Baggage,women, everything was abandoned by Bessus and his captains; and one otherimpediment also they left behind. By the side of a pool of water far away fromthe road a Macedonian trooper presently found a deserted mule-cart with itsmules still in the traces. In this cart lay Darius, stabbed in a score of placesand bleeding to death. He had refused to go on with Bessus, refused to mount thehorse that was brought to him. So his captains had run him through with theirspears and left him. . . . He asked his captors for water. What else he may havesaid we do not know. The historians have seen fit to fabricate a quiteimpossible last dying speech for him. Probably he said very little. . . .When, a little after sunrise, Alexander came up, Darius was already dead. . . .To the historian of the world the wanderings of Alexander have an interest oftheir own quite apart from the light they throw upon his character. Just as thecampaign of Darius I lifted the curtain behind Greece and Macedonia, and showedus something of the silent background to the north of the audible and recordedhistory of the early civilizations, so now Alexander’s campaigns take us intoregions about which there had hitherto been no trustworthy record made.We discover they were not desert regions, but full of a gathering life of theirown.He marched to the shores of the Caspian, thence he travelled eastward acrosswhat is now called Western Turkestan. He founded a city that is now known asHerat; whence he went northward by Cabul and by what is now Samarkand, right upinto the mountains of Central Turkestan. He returned southward, and came downinto India by the Khyber Pass. He fought a great battle on the Upper Indusagainst a very tall and chivalrous king, Porus, in which the Macedonian infantryencountered an array of elephants and defeated them. Possibly he would havepushed eastward across the deserts to the Ganges valley, but his troops refusedto go further. Possibly, had they not done so, then or later he would have goneon until he vanished eastward out of history. But he was forced to turn about.He built a fleet and descended to the mouth of the Indus. There he divided hisforces. The main army he took along the desolate coast back to the Persian Gulf,and on the way it suffered dreadfully and lost many men through thirst. Thefleet followed him by sea, and rejoined him at the entrance to the Persian Gulf.In the course of this six-year tour he fought battles, received the submissionof many strange peoples, and founded cities. He saw the dead body of Darius inJune, 330 BC; he returned to Susa in 324 BC. He found the empire in disorder:the provincial satraps raising armies of their own, Bactria and Media ininsurrection, and Olympias making government impossible in Macedonia. Harpalus,the royal treasurer, had bolted with all that was portable of the royaltreasure, and was making his way, bribing as he went, towards Greece. Some ofthe Harpalus money is said to have reached Demosthenes.But before we deal with the closing chapter of the story of Alexander, let ussay a word or so about these northern regions into which he wandered. It isevident that from the Danube region right across South Russia, right across thecountry to the north of the Caspian, right across the country to the east of theCaspian, as far as the mountain masses of the Pamir Plateau and eastward intothe Tarim basin of Eastern Turkestan, there spread then a series of similarbarbaric tribes and peoples all at about the same stage of culture, and for themost part Aryan in their language and possibly Nordic in their race. They hadfew cities, mostly they were nomadic; at times they settled temporarily tocultivate the land. They were certainly already mingling in Central Asia withMongolian tribes, but the Mongolian tribes were not then prevalent there.An immense process of drying up and elevation has been going on in these partsof the world during the last ten thousand years. Ten thousand years ago therewas probably a continuous water barrier between the basin of the Obi and theAral-Caspian sea. As this had dried up and the marshy land had becomesteppe-like country, Nordic nomads from the west and Mongolian nomads from theeast had met and mixed, and the riding horse had come back into the westernworld. It is evident this great stretch of country was becoming a region ofaccumulation for these barbaric peoples. They were very loosely attached to thelands they occupied. They lived in tents and wagons rather than houses. A briefcycle of plentiful and healthy years, or a cessation of tribal warfare undersome strong ruler, would lead to considerable increases of population; then twoor three hard years would suffice to send the tribes wandering again in searchof food.From before the dawn of recorded history this region of human accumulationbetween the Danube and China had been, as it were, intermittently raining outtribes southward and westward. It was like a cloud bank behind the settledlandscape that accumulated and then precipitated invaders. We have noted how theKeltic peoples drizzled westward, how the Italians, the Greeks, and theirEpirote, Macedonian, and Phrygian kindred came south. We have noted, too, theCimmerian drive from the east, like a sudden driving shower of barbarians acrossAsia Minor, the southward coming of the Scythians and Medes and Persians, andthe Aryan descent into India. About a century before Alexander there had been afresh Aryan invasion of Italy by a Keltic people, the Gauls, who had settled inthe valley of the Po. Those various races came down out of their northernobscurity into the light of history; and meanwhile beyond that light thereservoir accumulated for fresh discharges. Alexander’s march in Central Asiabrings now into our history names that are fresh to us; the Parthians, a race ofmounted bowmen who were destined to play an important role in history a centuryor so later, and the Bactrians who lived in the sandy native land of the camel.Everywhere he seems to have met Aryan-speaking peoples. The Mongolian barbariansto the north-eastward were still unsuspected, no one imagined there was yetanother great cloud bank of population beyond the Scythians and their kind, inthe north of China, that was presently also to begin a drift westward andsouthward, mixing as it came with the Nordic Scythians and every other people ofkindred habits that it encountered. As yet only China knew of the Huns; therewere no Turks in Western Turkestan or anywhere else then, no Tartars in theworld.This glimpse of the state of affairs in Turkestan in the fourth century BC isone of the most interesting aspects of the wanderings of Alexander; another ishis raid through the Punjab. From the point of view of the teller of the humanstory it is provocative that he did not go on into the Ganges country, and thatconsequently we have no independent accounts by Greek writers of the life inancient Bengal. But there is a considerable literature in various Indianlanguages dealing with Indian history and social life that still needs to bemade accessible to European readers.§ 5Alexander had been in undisputed possession of the Persian empire for six years.He was now thirty-one. In those six years he had created very little. He hadretained most of the organization of the Persian provinces, appointing freshsatraps or retaining the former ones; the roads, the ports, the organization ofthe empire was still as Cyrus, his greater predecessor, had left them; in Egypthe had merely replaced old provincial governors by new ones; in India he haddefeated Porus, and then left him in power much as he found him, except thatPorus was now called a satrap by the Greeks. Alexander had, it is true, plannedout a number of towns, and some of them were to grow into great towns; seventeenAlexandrias he founded altogether;1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en92]but he had destroyed Tyre, and with Tyre the security of the sea routes whichhad hitherto been the chief westward outlet for Mesopotamia. Historians say thathe Hellenized the east. But Babylonia and Egypt swarmed with Greeks before histime; he was not the cause, he was a part of the Hellenization. For a time thewhole world, from the Adriatic to the Indus, was under one ruler; so far he hadrealized the dreams of Isocrates and Philip his father. But how far was hemaking this a permanent and enduring union? How far as yet was it anything morethan a dazzling but transitory flourish of his own magnificent self?He was making no great roads, setting up no sure sea communications. It is idleto accuse him of leaving education alone, because the idea that empires must becemented by education was still foreign to human thought. But he was forming nogroup of statesmen about him; he was thinking of no successor; he was creatingno tradition—nothing more than a personal legend. The idea that the world wouldhave to go on after Alexander, engaged in any other employment than thediscussion of his magnificence, seems to have been outside his mental range. Hewas still young, it is true, but well before Philip was one and thirty he hadbeen thinking of the education of Alexander.Was Alexander a statesman at all?Some students of his career assure us that he was; that now at Susa he planned amighty world empire, seeing it not simply as a Macedonian conquest of the world,but as a melting together of racial traditions. He did one thing, at any rate,that gives colour to this idea; he held a great marriage feast, in which he andninety of his generals and friends were married to Persian brides. He himselfmarried a daughter of Darius, though already he possessed an Asiatic wife inRoxana, the daughter of the king of Samarkand. This wholesale wedding was made avery splendid festival, and at the same time all of his Macedonian soldiers, tothe number of several thousands, who had married Asiatic brides, were givenwedding gifts. This has been called the Marriage of Europe and Asia; the twocontinents were to be joined, wrote Plutarch, “in lawful wedlock and bycommunity of offspring.” And next he began to train recruits from Persia and thenorth, Parthians, Bactrians, and the like, in the distinctive disciplines of thephalanx and the cavalry. Was that also to assimilate Europe and Asia, or was itto make himself independent of his Macedonians? They thought the latter, at anyrate, and mutinied, and it was with some difficulty that he brought them to apenitent mood and induced them to take part in a common feast with the Persians.The historians have made a long and eloquent speech for him on this occasion,but the gist of it was that he bade his Macedonians begone, and gave no sign ofhow he proposed they should get home out of Persia. After three days of dismaythey submitted to him and begged his forgiveness.Here is the matter for a very pretty discussion. Was Alexander really planning aracial fusion or had he just fallen in love with the pomp and divinity of anOriental monarch, and wished to get rid of these Europeans to whom he was only aking-leader? The writers of his own time, and those who lived near to his time,lean very much to the latter alternative. They insist upon his immense vanity.They relate how he began to wear the robes and tiara of a Persian monarch. “Atfirst only before the barbarians and privately, but afterwards he came to wearit in public when he sat for the dispatch of business.” And presently hedemanded Oriental prostrations from his friends.One thing seems to support the suggestion of great personal vanity in Alexander.His portrait was painted and sculptured frequently, and always he is representedas a beautiful youth, with wonderful locks flowing backward from a broadforehead. Previously most men had worn beards. But Alexander, enamoured of hisown youthful loveliness, would not part with it; he remained a sham boy atthirty-two; he shaved his face, and so set a fashion in Greece and Italy thatlasted many centuries.127 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_127_r1.gif]The stories of violence and vanity in his closing years cluster thick upon hismemory. He listened to tittle-tattle about Philotas, the son of Parmenio, one ofhis most trusted and faithful generals. Philotas, it was said, had boasted tosome woman he was making love to that Alexander was a mere boy; that, but forsuch men as his father and himself, there would have been no conquest of Persia,and the like. Such assertions had a certain element of truth in them. The womanwas brought to Alexander, who listened to her treacheries. Presently Philotaswas accused of conspiracy, and, upon very insufficient evidence, tortured andexecuted. Then Alexander thought of Parmenio, whose other two sons had died forhim in battle. He sent swift messengers to assassinate the old man before hecould hear of his son’s death! Now Parmenio had been one of the most trusted ofPhilip’s generals; it was Parmenio who had led the Macedonian armies into Asiabefore the murder of Philip. There can be little doubt of the substantial truthof this story, nor about the execution of Callisthenes, the nephew of Aristotle,who refused Alexander divine honours, and “went about with as much pride as ifhe had demolished a tyranny, while the young men followed him as the onlyfreeman among thousands.” Mixed with such incidents we have the veryilluminating story of the drunken quarrel in which he killed Clitus. The monarchand his company had been drinking hard, and the drink had made the talk loud andfree. There was much flattery of the “young god,” much detraction of Philip, atwhich Alexander had smiled with satisfaction.2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en93] This drunken self-complacency was morethan the Macedonians could stand; it roused Clitus, his foster-brother, to afrenzy. Clitus reproached Alexander with his Median costume and praised Philip,there was a loud quarrel, and, to end it, Clitus was hustled out of the room byhis friends. He was, however, in the obstinate phase of drunkenness, and hereturned by another entrance. He was heard outside quoting Euripides “in a boldand disrespectful tone”:Are these your customs? Is it thus that GreeceRewards her combatants? Shall one man claimThe trophies won by thousands?Whereupon Alexander snatched a spear from one of his guards and ran Clitusthrough the body as he lifted the curtain to come in. . . .One is forced to believe that this was the real atmosphere of the youngconqueror’s life. Then the story of his frantic and cruel display of grief forHephæstion can scarcely be all invention. If it is true, or in any part true, itdisplays a mind ill-balanced and altogether wrapped up in personal things, towhom empire was no more than opportunity for egoistic display, and all theresources of the world, stuff for freaks of that sort of “generosity” which robsa thousand people to extort the admiration of one astounded recipient.128 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_128_r1.gif]Hephæstion, being ill, was put upon a strict diet, but in the absence of hisphysician at the theatre he ate a roasted fowl and drank a flagon of iced wine,in consequence of which he died. Thereupon Alexander decided upon a display ofgrief. It was the grief of a lunatic. He had the physician crucified! He orderedevery horse and mule in Persia to be shorn, and pulled down the battlements ofthe neighbouring cities. He prohibited all music in his camp for a long time,and, having taken certain villages of the Cusæans, he caused all the adults tobe massacred, as a sacrifice to the manes of Hephæstion. Finally he set asideten thousand talents (a talent ==£240) for a tomb. For those days this was anenormous sum of money. None of which things did any real honour to Hephæstion,but they served to demonstrate to an awe-stricken world what a tremendous thingthe sorrow of Alexander could be.This last story and many such stories may be lies or distortions orexaggerations. But they have a vein in common. After a bout of hard drinking inBabylon a sudden fever came upon Alexander (323 BC), and he sickened and died.He was still only thirty-three years of age. Forthwith the world empire he hadsnatched at and held in his hands, as a child might snatch at and hold aprecious vase, fell to the ground and was shattered to pieces.Whatever appearance of a worldwide order may have gleamed upon men’simaginations, vanished at his death. The story becomes the story of a barbaricautocracy in confusion. Everywhere the provincial rulers set up for themselves.In the course of a few years the entire family of Alexander had been destroyed.Roxana, his barbarian wife, was prompt to murder, as a rival, the daughter ofDarius. She herself presently bore Alexander a posthumous son, who was alsocalled Alexander. He was murdered, with her, a few years later (311 BC).Hercules, the only other son of Alexander, was murdered also. So, too, wasAridæus, the weak-minded half-brother (see § 2). Plutarch gives a last glimpseof Olympias during a brief interval of power in Macedonia, accusing first thisperson and then that of poisoning her wonderful son. Many she killed in herfury. The bodies of some of his circle who had died after his death she causedto be dug up, but we do not know if any fresh light was shed upon his death bythese disinterments. Finally Olympias was killed in Macedonia by the friends ofthose she had slain.§ 6From this welter of crime there presently emerged three leading figures. Much ofthe old Persian empire, as far as the Indus eastward and almost to Lydia in thewest, was held by one general Seleucus, who founded a dynasty, the SeleucidDynasty; Macedonia fell to another Macedonian general, Antigonus; a thirdMacedonian, Ptolemy, secured Egypt, and making Alexandria his chief city,established a sufficient naval ascendancy to keep also Cyprus and most of thecoast of Phœnicia and Asia Minor. The Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires lasted fora considerable time; the forms of government in Asia Minor and the Balkans weremore unstable. Two maps will help the reader to a sense of the kaleidoscopicnature of the political boundaries of the third century BC. Antigonus wasdefeated and killed at the battle of Ipsus (301), leaving Lysimachus, thegovernor of Thrace, and Cassander, of Macedonia and Greece, as equallytransitory successors. Minor governors carved out smaller states. Meanwhile thebarbarians swung down into the broken-up and enfeebled world of civilizationfrom the west and from the east. From the west came the Gauls, a people closelyrelated to the Kelts. They raided down through Macedonia and Greece to Delphi,and (227 BC) two sections of them crossed the Bosphorus into Asia Minor, beingfirst employed as mercenaries and then setting up for themselves as independentplunderers; and after raiding almost to the Taurus, they settled in the oldPhrygian land, holding the people about them to tribute. (These Gauls of Phrygiabecame the Galatians of St. Paul’s Epistle). Armenia and the southern shores ofthe Black Sea became a confusion of changing rulers. Kings with Hellenisticideas appeared in Cappadocia, in Pontus (the south shore of the Black Sea), inBithynia, and in Pergamum. From the east the Scythians and the Parthians andBactrians also drove southward. . . . For a time there were Greek-ruled Bactrianstates becoming more and more Orientalized; in the second century BC Greekadventurers from Bactria raided down into North India and founded short-livedkingdoms there, the last eastward fling of the Greek; then gradually barbarismfell again like a curtain between the Western civilizations and India.129 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_129_r1.gif]§ 7Amidst all these shattered fragments of the burst bubble of Hellenic empire onesmall state stands out and demands at least a brief section to itself, thekingdom of Pergamum. We hear first of this town as an independent centre duringthe struggle that ended in the battle of Ipsus. While the tide of the Gaulishinvasion swirled and foamed to and fro about Asia Minor between the years 277and 241, Pergamum for a time paid them tribute, but she retained her generalindependence, and at last, under Attalus I, refused her tribute and defeatedthem in two decisive battles. For more than a century thereafter (until 133 BC)Pergamum remained free, and was perhaps during that period the most highlycivilized state in the world. On the hill of the Acropolis was reared a richgroup of buildings, palaces, temples, a museum, and a library, rivals of thoseof Alexandria of which we shall presently tell, and almost the first in theworld. Under the princes of Pergamum, Greek art blossomed afresh, and thereliefs of the altar of the temple of Zeus and the statues of the fighting anddying Gauls which were made there, are among the great artistic treasures ofmankind.In a little while, as we shall tell later, the influence of a new power began tobe felt in the Eastern Mediterranean, the power of the Roman republic, friendlyto Greece and to Greek civilization; and in this power the Hellenic communitiesof Pergamum and Rhodes found a natural and useful ally and supporter against theGalatians and against the Orientalized Seleucid empire. We shall relate how atlast the Roman power came into Asia, how it defeated the Seleucid empire at thebattle of Magnesia (190 BC), and drove it out of Asia Minor and beyond theTaurus mountains, and how finally in 133 BC Attalus III, the last king ofPergamum, bowing to his sense of an inevitable destiny, made the Roman republicthe heir to his kingdom, which became then the Roman province of “Asia.”§ 8Nearly all historians are disposed to regard the career of Alexander the Greatas marking an epoch in human affairs. It drew together all the known world,excepting only the western Mediterranean, into one drama. But the opinions menhave formed of Alexander himself vary enormously. They fall, most of them, intotwo main schools. One type of scholar is fascinated by the youth and splendourof this young man. These Alexander-worshippers seem disposed to take him at hisown valuation, to condone every crime and folly either as the mere ebullience ofa rich nature or as the bitter necessity to some gigantic scheme, and to regardhis life as framed upon a design, a scheme of statesmanship, such as all thewider knowledge and wider ideas of these later times barely suffice to bringinto the scope of our understanding. On the other hand, there are those who seehim only as a wrecker of the slowly maturing possibilities of a free andtranquil Hellenized world.Before we ascribe to Alexander or to his father Philip schemes of world policysuch as a twentieth-century historian-philosopher might approve, we shall dowell to consider very carefully the utmost range of knowledge and thought thatwas possible in those days. The world of Plato, Isocrates, and Aristotle hadpractically no historical perspective at all; there had not been such a thing ashistory in the world, history, that is, as distinguished from mere priestlychronicles, until the last couple of centuries. Even highly educated men had themost circumscribed ideas of geography and foreign countries. For most men theworld was still flat and limitless. The only systematic political philosophy wasbased on the experiences of minute city states, and took no thought of empires.Nobody knew anything of the origins of civilization. No one had speculated uponeconomics before that time. No one had worked out the reaction of one socialclass upon another. We are too apt to consider the career of Alexander as thecrown of some process that had long been afoot; as the climax of a crescendo. Ina sense, no doubt, it was that; but much more true is it that it was not so muchan end as a beginning; it was the first revelation to the human imagination ofthe oneness of human affairs. The utmost reach of the thought of Greece beforehis time was of a Persian empire Hellenized, a predominance in the world ofMacedonians and Greeks. But before Alexander was dead, and much more after hewas dead and there had been time to think him over, the conception of a worldlaw and organization was a practicable and assimilable idea for the minds ofmen.For some generations Alexander the Great was for mankind the symbol andembodiment of world order and world dominion. He became a fabulous being. Hishead, adorned with the divine symbols of the demigod Hercules or the god AmmonRa, appears on the coins of such among his successors as could claim to be hisheirs. Then the idea of world dominion was taken up by another great people, apeople who for some centuries exhibited considerable political genius, theRomans; and the figure of another conspicuous adventurer, Cæsar, eclipsed forthe western half of the old world the figure of Alexander.So by the beginning of the third century BC we find already arisen in theWestern civilization of the old world three of the great structural ideas thatrule the mind of contemporary mankind. We have already traced the escape ofwriting and knowledge from the secrets and mysteries and initiations of theold-world priesthoods, and the development of the idea of a universal knowledge,of a universally understandable and communicable history and philosophy. We havetaken the figures of Herodotus and Aristotle as typical exponents of this firstgreat idea, the idea of science—using the word science in its widest andproperest sense, to include history and signify a clear vision of man inrelation to the things about him. We have traced also the generalization ofreligion among the Babylonians, Jews, and other Semitic peoples, from the darkworship in temples and consecrated places of some local or tribal god to theopen service of one universal God of Righteousness, whose temple is the wholeworld. And now we have traced also the first germination of the idea of a worldpolity. The rest of the history of mankind is very largely the history of thosethree ideas of science, of a universal righteousness, and of a human commonweal,spreading out from the minds of the rare and exceptional persons and peoples inwhich they first originated, into the general consciousness of the race, andgiving first a new colour, then a new spirit, and then a new direction to humanaffairs.130 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_130_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"131 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_131_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR 132[bano_9781411428843_oeb_132_r1.gif]SCIENCE AND RELIGION AT ALEXANDRIA§ 1. THE SCIENCE OF ALEXANDRIA. § 2. PHILOSOPHY OF ALEXANDRIA. § 3. ALEXANDRIAAS A FACTORY OF RELIGIONS.§ 1ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS FRAGMENTS OF THE BRIEF WORLD EMPIRE of Alexander theGreat was Egypt, which fell to the share of the Ptolemy whose name we havealready noted as one of the associates of Alexander whom King Philip hadbanished. The country was at a secure distance from plundering Gaul or Parthian,and the destruction of Tyre and the Phœnician navy, and the creation ofAlexandria gave Egypt a temporary naval ascendancy in the Eastern Mediterranean.Alexandria grew to proportions that rivalled Carthage; eastward she had anoverseas trade through the Red Sea with Arabia and India; and westward hertraffic competed with the Carthaginian. In the Macedonian and Greek governors ofthe Ptolemies, the Egyptians found a government more sympathetic and tolerablethan any they had ever known since they ceased to be a self-governing empire.Indeed it is rather that Egypt conquered and annexed the Ptolemies politically,than that the Macedonians ruled Egypt.There was a return to Egyptian political ideas, rather than any attempt toHellenize the government of the country. Ptolemy became Pharaoh, the god-king,and his administration continued the ancient tradition of Pepi, Thotmes,Rameses, and Necho. Alexandria, however, for her town affairs, and subject tothe divine overlordship of Pharaoh, had a constitution of the Greek city type.And the language of the court and administration was Attic Greek. Greek becameso much the general language of educated people in Egypt that the Jewishcommunity there found it necessary to translate their Bible into the Greeklanguage, many men of their own people being no longer able to understandHebrew. Attic Greek for some centuries before and after Christ was the languageof all educated men from the Adriatic to the Persian Gulf.Of all Alexander’s group of young men, Ptolemy seems to have done most to carryout those ideas of a systematic organization of knowledge with which Aristotlehad no doubt familiarized the court of Philip of Macedon. Ptolemy was a man ofvery extraordinary intellectual gifts, at once creative and modest, with acertain understandable cynicism towards the strain of Olympias in the mind ofAlexander. His contemporary history of Alexander’s campaigns has perished; butit was a source to which all the surviving accounts are deeply indebted.133 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_133_r1.gif]The Museum he set up in Alexandria was in effect the first university in theworld. As its name implies, it was dedicated to the service of the Muses, whichwas also the case with the Peripatetic school at Athens. It was, however, areligious body only in form, in order to meet the legal difficulties ofendowment in a world that had never foreseen such a thing as a secularintellectual process. It was essentially a college of learned men engagedchiefly in research and record, but also to a certain extent in teaching. At theoutset, and for two or three generations, the Museum at Alexandria presentedsuch a scientific constellation as even Athens at its best could not rival.Particularly sound and good was the mathematical and geographical work. Thenames of Euclid, familiar to every schoolboy, Eratosthenes, who measured thesize of the earth and came within fifty miles of the true diameter, Apollonius,who wrote on conic sections, stand out. Hipparchus made the first attempt tocatalogue and map the stars with a view to checking any changes that might beoccurring in the heavens. Hero devised the first steam engine. Archimedes cameto Alexandria to study, and remained a frequent correspondent of the Museum. Themedical school of Alexandria was equally famous. For the first time in theworld’s history a standard of professional knowledge was set up. Herophilus, thegreatest of the Alexandrian anatomists, is said to have conducted vivisectionsupon condemned criminals. Other teachers, in opposition to Herophilus, condemnedthe study of anatomy and developed the science of drugs. But this scientificblaze at Alexandria did not endure altogether for more than a century. Theorganization of the Museum was not planned to ensure its mental continuity. Itwas a “royal” college; its professors and fellows (as we may call them) wereappointed and paid by Pharaoh. “The republican character of the privatecorporations called the schools or academies at Athens was far more stable andindependent.” Royal patronage was all very well so long as Pharaoh was PtolemyI, or Ptolemy II, but the strain degenerated, and the long tradition of Egyptianpriestcraft presently swallowed up the Ptolemies—and destroyed the Aristotelianmentality of the Museum altogether. The Museum had not existed for a hundredyears before its scientific energy was extinct.Side by side with the Museum, Ptolemy I created a more enduring monument tohimself in the great library. This was a combination of state library and statepublishing upon a scale hitherto unheard of. It was to be altogetherencyclopædic. If any stranger brought an unknown book to Egypt, he had to haveit copied for the collection, and a considerable staff of copyists was engagedcontinually in making duplicates of all the more popular and necessary works.The library, like a university press, had an outward trade. It was a booksellingaffair. Under Callimachus, the head of the library during the time of Ptolemy IIand III, the arrangement and cataloguing of the accumulations was systematicallyundertaken. In those days, it must be remembered, books were not in pages, butrolled like the music-rolls of the modern piano-player, and in order to refer toany particular passage, a reader had to roll back or roll forward verytediously, a process which wore out books and readers together. One thinks atonce of a simple and obvious little machine by which such a roll could have beenquickly wound to and fro for reference, but nothing of the sort seems to havebeen used. Every time a roll was read it was handled by two perspiring hands. Itwas to minimize the waste of time and trouble that Callimachus broke up longworks, such as the History of Herodotus, into “books” or volumes, as we shouldcall them, each upon a separate roll. The library of Alexandria drew a farvaster crowd of students than the teachers of the Museum. The lodging andcatering for these visitors from all parts of the world became a considerablebusiness interest for the Alexandrian population.134 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_134_r1.gif]It is curious to note how slowly the mechanism of the intellectual lifeimproves. Contrast the ordinary library facilities of a middle-class Englishhome, such as the present writer is now working in, with the inconveniences anddeficiencies of the equipment of an Alexandrian writer, and one realizes theenormous waste of time, physical exertion, and attention that went on throughall the centuries during which that library flourished. Before the presentwriter lie half a dozen books, and there are good indices to three of them. Hecan pick up any one of these six books, refer quickly to a statement, verify aquotation, and go on writing. Contrast with that the tedious unfolding of arolled manuscript. Close at hand are two encyclopædias, a dictionary, an atlasof the world, a biographical dictionary, and other books of reference. They haveno marginal indices, it is true; but that perhaps is asking for too much atpresent. There were no such resources in the world in 300 BC. Alexandria hadstill to produce the first grammar and the first dictionary. This present bookis being written in manuscript; it is then taken by a typist and typewrittenvery accurately. It can then, with the utmost convenience, be read over,corrected amply, rearranged freely, retyped, and recorrected. The Alexandrianauthor had to dictate or recopy every word he wrote. Before he could turn backto what he had written previously, he had to dry his last words by waving themin the air or pouring sand over them; he had not even blotting-paper. Whateveran author wrote had to be recopied again and again before it could reach anyconsiderable circle of readers, and every copyist introduced some new error.Whenever a need for maps or diagrams arose, there were fresh difficulties. Sucha science as anatomy, for example, depending as it does upon accurate drawing,must have been enormously hampered by the natural limitations of the copyist.The transmission of geographical fact again must have been almost incrediblytedious. No doubt a day will come when a private library and writing-desk of theyear AD 1919 will seem quaintly clumsy and difficult; but, measured by thestandards of Alexandria, they are astonishingly quick, efficient, and economicalof nervous and mental energy.No attempt seems to have been made at Alexandria to print anything at all. Thatstrikes one at first as a very remarkable fact. The world was crying out forbooks, and not simply for books. There was an urgent public need for notices,proclamations, and the like. Yet there is nothing in the history of the Westerncivilizations that one can call printing until the fifteenth century AD. It isnot as though printing was a recondite art or dependent upon any precedent andpreliminary discoveries. Printing is the most obvious of dodges. In principle ithas always been known. As we have already stated, there is ground for supposingthat the Palæolithic men of the Magdalenian period may have printed designs ontheir leather garments. The “seals” of ancient Sumeria again were printingdevices. Coins are print. Illiterate persons in all ages have used wooden ormetal stamps for their signatures; William I, the Norman Conqueror of England,for example, used such a stamp with ink to sign documents. In China the classicswere being printed by the second century AD. Yet either because of a complex ofsmall difficulties about ink or papyrus or the form of books, or because of someprotective resistance on the part of the owners of the slave copyists, orbecause the script was too swift and easy to set men thinking how to write itstill more easily, as the Chinese character or the Gothic letters did, orbecause of a gap in the social system between men of thought and knowledge andmen of technical skill, printing was not used—not even used for the exactreproduction of illustrations.The chief reason for this failure to develop printing systematically lies, nodoubt, in the fact that there was no abundant supply of printable material of auniform texture and convenient form. The supply of papyrus was strictly limited,strip had to be fastened to strip, and there was no standard size of sheet.Paper had yet to come from China to release the mind of Europe. Had there beenpresses, they would have had to stand idle while the papyrus rolls were slowlymade. But this explanation does not account for the failure to use blockprinting in the case of illustrations and diagrams.These limitations enable us to understand why it was that Alexandria could atonce achieve the most extraordinary intellectual triumphs—for such a feat asthat of Eratosthenes, for instance, having regard to his poverty of apparatus,is sufficient to put him on a level with Newton or Pasteur—and yet have littleor no effect upon the course of politics or the lives and thoughts of peopleround about her. Her Museum and library were a centre of light, but it was lightin a dark lantern hidden from the general world. There were no means of carryingits results even to sympathetic men abroad except by tedious letter-writing.There was no possibility of communicating what was known there to the generalbody of men. Students had to come at great cost to themselves to this crowdedcentre because there was no other way of gathering even scraps of knowledge. AtAthens and Alexandria there were bookstalls where manuscript notebooks ofvariable quality could be bought at reasonable prices, but any extension ofeducation to larger classes and other centres would have produced at once arestrictive shortage of papyrus. Education did not reach into the masses at all;to become more than superficially educated one had to abandon the ordinary lifeof the times and come for long years to live a hovering existence in theneighbourhood of ill-equipped and overworked sages. Learning was not indeed socomplete a withdrawal from ordinary life as initiation into a priesthood, but itwas still something in that nature.And very speedily that feeling of freedom, that openness and directness ofstatement which is the vital air of the true intellectual life, faded out ofAlexandria. From the first the patronage even of Ptolemy I set a limit topolitical discussion. Presently the dissensions of the schools let in thesuperstitions and prejudices of the city mob to scholastic affairs.Wisdom passed away from Alexandria and left pedantry behind. For the use ofbooks was substituted the worship of books. Very speedily the learned became aspecialized queer class with unpleasant characteristics of its own. The Museumhad not existed for half a dozen generations before Alexandria was familiar witha new type of human being; shy, eccentric, unpractical, incapable of essentials,strangely fierce upon trivialities of literary detail, as bitterly jealous ofthe colleague within as of the unlearned without, the bent Scholarly Man. He wasas intolerant as a priest, though he had no altar; as obscurantist as amagician, though he had no cave. For him no method of copying was sufficientlytedious and no rare book sufficiently inaccessible. He was a sort of byproductof the intellectual process of mankind. For many precious generations thenew-lit fires of the human intelligence were to be seriously banked down by thisbyproduct.Right thinking is necessarily an open process, and the only science and historyof full value to men consist of what is generally and clearly known; this issurely a platitude, but we have still to discover how to preserve our centres ofphilosophy and research from the caking and darkening accumulations of narrowand dingy-spirited specialists. We have still to ensure that a man of learningshall be none the less a man of affairs, and that all that can be thought andknown is kept plainly, honestly, and easily available to the ordinary men andwomen who are the substance of mankind.§ 2At first the mental activities of Alexandria centred upon the Museum, and weremainly scientific. Philosophy, which in a more vigorous age had been a doctrineof power over self and the material world, without abandoning these pretensions,became in reality a doctrine of secret consolation. The stimulant changed intoan opiate. The philosopher let the world, as the vulgar say, rip, the world ofwhich he was a part, and consoled himself by saying in very beautiful andelaborate forms that the world was illusion and that there was in him somethingquintessential and sublime, outside and above the world. Athens, politicallyinsignificant, but still a great and crowded mart throughout the fourth century,decaying almost imperceptibly so far as outer seeming went, and treated with astrange respect that was half contempt by all the warring powers and adventurersof the world, was the fitting centre of such philosophical teaching. It wasquite a couple of centuries before the schools of Alexandria became as importantin philosophical discussion.§ 3If Alexandria was late to develop a distinctive philosophy, she was earlyprominent as a great factory and exchange of religious ideas.The Museum and Library represented only one of the three sides of the triplecity of Alexandria. They represented the Aristotelian, the Hellenic, andMacedonian element. But Ptolemy I had brought together two other factors to thisstrange centre. First there was a great number of Jews, brought partly fromPalestine, but largely also from those settlements in Egypt which had neverreturned to Jerusalem; these latter were the Jews of the Diaspora or Dispersion,a race of Jews who, as we have already noted in chapter 19, had not shared theBabylonian Captivity, but who were nevertheless in possession of the Bible andin close correspondence with their co-religionists throughout the world. TheseJews populated so great a quarter of Alexandria that the town became the largestJewish city in the world, with far more Jews in it than there were in Jerusalem.We have already noted that they had found it necessary to translate theirscriptures into Greek. And, finally, there was a great population of nativeEgyptians, also for the most part speaking Greek, but with the superstitioustemperament of the dark whites and with the vast tradition of forty centuries oftemple religion and temple sacrifices at the back of their minds. In Alexandriathree types of mind and spirit met, the three main types of the white race, theclearheaded criticism of the Aryan Greek, the moral fervour and monotheism ofthe Semitic Jew, and the deep Mediterranean tradition of mysteries andsacrifices that we have already seen at work in the secret cults and occultpractices of Greece, ideas which in Hamitic Egypt ruled proudly in great templesin the open light of day.These three were the permanent elements of the Alexandrian blend. But in theseaport and markets mingled men of every known race, comparing their religiousideas and customs. It is even related that in the third century BC. Buddhistmissionaries came from the court of King Asoka in India. Aristotle remarks inhis Politics that the religious beliefs of men are apt to borrow their form frompolitical institutions, “men assimilate the lives no less than the bodily formsof the gods to their own,” and this age of Greek-speaking great empires underautocratic monarchs was bearing hardly upon those merely local celebrities, theold tribal and city deities. Men were requiring deities with an outlook at leastas wide as the empires, and except where the interests of powerful priesthoodsstood in the way, a curious process of assimilation of gods was going on. Menfound that though there were many gods, they were all very much alike. Wherethere had been many gods, men came to think there must be really only one godunder a diversity of names. He had been everywhere—under an alias. The RomanJupiter, the Greek Zeus, the Egyptian Ammon, the putative father of Alexanderand the old antagonist of Amenophis IV the Babylonian Bel-Marduk, were allsufficiently similar to be identified.Father of all in every age, in every clime adored By saint, by savage and bysage, Jehovah, Jove or Lord.Where there were distinct differences, the difficulty was met by saying thatthese were different aspects of the same god. Bel-Marduk, however, was now avery decadent god indeed, who hardly survived as a pseudonym; Assur, Dagon, andthe like, poor old gods of fallen nations, had long since passed out of memory,and did not come into the amalgamation. Osiris, a god popular with the Egyptiancommonalty, was already identified with Apis, the sacred bull in the temple ofMemphis, and somewhat confused with Ammon. Under the name of Serapis he becamethe great god of Hellenic Alexandria. He was Jupiter-Serapis. The Egyptian cowgoddess, Hathor or Isis, was also represented now in human guise as the wife ofOsiris, to whom she bore the infant Horus, who grew up to be Osiris again. Thesebald statements sound strange, no doubt, to a modern mind, but theseidentifications and mixing up of one god with another are very illustrative ofthe struggle the quickening human intelligence was making to cling still toreligion and its emotional bonds and fellowship, while making its gods morereasonable and universal.This fusing of one god with another is called theocrasia, and nowhere was itmore vigorously going on than in Alexandria. Only two peoples resisted it inthis period: the Jews, who already had their faith in the One God of Heaven andEarth, Jehovah, and the Persians who had a monotheistic sun worship.It was Ptolemy I who set up not only the Museum in Alexandria, but the Serapeum,devoted to the worship of a trinity of god which represented the result of aprocess of theocrasia applied more particularly to the gods of Greece and Egypt.135 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_135_r1.gif]136 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_136_r1.gif]This trinity consisted of the god Serapis (== Osiris + Apis), the goddess Isis(== Hathor, the cow-moon goddess), and the child-god Horus. In one way oranother almost every other god was identified with one or other of these threeaspects of the one God, even the sun god Mithras of the Persians. And they wereeach other; they were three, but they were also one. They were worshipped withgreat fervour, and the jangling of a peculiar instrument, the sistrum, a frameset with bells and used rather after the fashion of the tambourine in theproceedings of the modern Salvation Army, was a distinctive accessory to theceremonies. And now for the first time we find the idea of immortality becomingthe central idea of a religion that extended beyond Egypt. Neither the earlyAryans nor the early Semites seem to have troubled very much about immortality,it has affected the Mongolian mind very little, but the continuation of theindividual life after death had been from the earliest times an intensepreccupation of the Egyptians. It played now a large part in the worship ofSerapis. In the devotional literature of his cult he is spoken of as “thesaviour and leader of souls, leading souls to the light and receiving themagain.” It is stated that “he raises the dead, he shows forth the longed-forlight of the sun to those who see, whose holy tombs contain multitudes of sacredbooks”; and again, “we never can escape him, he will save us, after death weshall still be the care of his providence.”1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en94]The ceremonial burning of candles and the offering of ex-votos, that is to sayof small models of parts of the human body in need of succour, was a part of theworship of the Serapeum. Isis attracted many devotees, who vowed their lives toher. Her images stood in the temple, crowned as the Queen of Heaven and bearingthe infant Horus in her arms. The candles flared and guttered before her, andthe wax ex-votos hung about the shrine. The novice was put through a long andcareful preparation, he took vows of celibacy, and when he was initiated hishead was shaved and he was clad in a linen garment. . . .In this worship of Serapis, which spread very widely throughout the civilizedworld in the third and second centuries BC, we see the most remarkableanticipations of usages and forms of expression that were destined to dominatethe European world throughout the Christian era. The essential idea, the livingspirit, of Christianity was, as we shall presently show, a new thing in thehistory of the mind and will of man; but the garments of ritual and symbol andformula that Christianity has worn, and still in many countries wears to thisday, were certainly woven in the cult and temples of Jupiter, Serapis, and Isisthat spread now from Alexandria throughout the civilized world in the age oftheocrasia in the second and first centuries before Christ."},{"pageContent":"137 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_137_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE 138[bano_9781411428843_oeb_138_r1.gif]THE RISE AND SPREAD OF BUDDHISM§ 1.

TWO GREAT CHINESE TEACHERS. § 6.THE CORRUPTIONS OF BUDDHISM. § 7. THE PRESENT RANGE OF BUDDHISM.§ 1IT IS INTERESTING TO TURN FROM THE MENTAL AND MORAL ACTIVITIES OF Athens andAlexandria, and the growth of human ideas in the Mediterranean world, to thealmost entirely separate intellectual life of India. Here was a civilizationwhich from the first seems to have grown up upon its own roots and with acharacter of its own. It was cut off from the civilizations to the west and tothe east by vast mountain barriers and desert regions. The Aryan tribes who hadcome down into the peninsula soon lost touch with their kindred to the west andnorth, and developed upon lines of their own. This was more particularly thecase with those who had passed on into the Ganges country and beyond. They founda civilization already scattered over India, the Dravidian civilization. Thishad arisen independently, just as the Sumerian, Cretan, and Egyptiancivilizations seem to have arisen, out of that widespread development of theneolithic culture, the heliolithic culture, whose characteristics we havealready described. They revived and changed this Dravidian civilization much asthe Greeks did the Ægean or the Semites the Sumerian.These Indian Aryans were living under different conditions from those thatprevailed to the northwest. They were living in a warmer climate, in which adiet of beef and fermented liquor was destructive; they were forced, therefore,to a generally vegetarian dietary, and the prolific soil, almost unasked, gavethem all the food they needed. There was no further reason for them to wander;the crops and seasons were trustworthy. They wanted little clothing or housing.They wanted so little that trade was undeveloped. There was still land foreveryone who desired to cultivate a patch—and a little patch sufficed. Theirpolitical life was simple and comparatively secure; no great conquering powershad arisen as yet in India, and her natural barriers sufficed to stop the earlyimperialisms to the west of her and to the east. Thousands of comparativelypacific little village republics and chieftainships were spread over the land.There was no sea life, there were no pirate raiders, no strange traders. Onemight write a history of India coming down to four hundred years ago and hardlymention the sea.The history of India for many centuries had been happier, less fierce, and moredreamlike than any other history. The noblemen, the rajahs, hunted; life waslargely made up of love stories. Here and there a maharajah arose amidst therajahs and built a city, caught and tamed many elephants, slew many tigers, andleft a tradition of his splendour and his wonderful processions.It was somewhen between 500 and 600 BC, when Crœsus was flourishing in Lydia andCyrus was preparing to snatch Babylon from Nabonidus, that the founder ofBuddhism was born in India. He was born in a small republican tribal communityin the north of Bengal under the Himalayas, in what is now overgrown junglecountry on the borders of Nepal. The little state was ruled by a family, theSakya clan, of which this man, Siddhattha Gautama, was a member. Siddhattha washis personal name, like Caius or John; Gautama, or Gôtama, his family name, likeCæsar or Smith; Sakya his clan name, like Julius. The institution of caste wasnot yet fully established in India, and the Brahmins, though they wereprivileged and influential, had not yet struggled to the head of the system; butthere were already strongly marked class distinctions and a practicallyimpermeable partition between the noble Aryans and the darker common people.Gautama belonged to the former race. His teaching, we may note, was called theAryan Path, the Aryan Truth.It is only within the last half-century that the increasing study of the Palilanguage, in which most of the original sources were written, has given theworld a real knowledge of the life and actual thought of Gautama. Previously hisstory was overlaid by monstrous accumulations of legend, and his teachingviolently misconceived. But now we have a very human and understandable accountof him.He was a good-looking, capable young man of fortune, and until he wastwenty-nine he lived the ordinary aristocratic life of his time. It was not avery satisfying life intellectually. There was no literature except the oraltradition of the Vedas, and that was chiefly monopolized by the Brahmins; therewas even less knowledge. The world was bound by the snowy Himalayas to the northand spread indefinitely to the south. The city of Benares, which had a king, wasabout a hundred miles away. The chief amusements were hunting and lovemaking.All the good that life seemed to offer, Gautama enjoyed. He was married atnineteen to a beautiful cousin. For some years they remained childless. Hehunted and played and went about in his sunny world of gardens and groves andirrigated rice-fields. And it was amidst this life that a great discontent fellupon him. It was the unhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment. He livedamidst plenty and beauty, he passed from gratification to gratification, and hissoul was not satisfied. It was as if he heard the destinies of the race callingto him. He felt that the existence he was leading was not the reality of life,but a holiday—a holiday that had gone on too long.While he was in this mood he saw four things that served to point his thoughts.He was driving on some excursion of pleasure, when he came upon a man dreadfullybroken down by age. The poor bent, enfeebled creature struck his imagination.“Such is the way of life,” said Channa, his charioteer, and “to that we must allcome.” While this was yet in his mind he chanced upon a man suffering horriblyfrom some loathsome disease. “Such is the way of life,” said Channa. The thirdvision was of an unburied body, swollen, eyeless, mauled by passing birds andbeasts and altogether terrible. “That is the way of life,” said Channa.The sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the unsatisfactoriness ofall happiness, descended upon the mind of Gautama. And then he and Channa sawone of those wandering ascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.These men lived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and inreligious discussion. For many men before Gautama in that land of uneventfulsunshine had found life distressing and mysterious. These ascetics were allsupposed to be seeking some deeper reality in life, and a passionate desire todo likewise took possession of Gautama.He was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was broughtto him that his wife had been delivered of his firstborn son. “This is anothertie to break,” said Gautama.139 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_139_r1.gif]He returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow clansmen. Therewas a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the birth of this new tie, andin the night Gautama awoke in a great agony of spirit, “like a man who is toldthat his house is on fire.” In the anteroom the dancing girls were lying instrips of darkness and moonlight. He called Channa, and told him to prepare hishorse. Then he went softly to the threshold of his wife’s chamber, and saw herby the light of a little oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by flowers, withhis infant son in her arm. He felt a great craving to take up the child in onefirst and last embrace before he departed, but the fear of waking his wifeprevented him, and at last he turned away and went out into the bright Indianmoonshine to Channa waiting with the horses, and mounted and stole away.As he rode through the night with Channa, it seemed to him that Mara, theTempter of Mankind, filled the sky and disputed with him. “Return,” said Mara,“and be a king, and I will make you the greatest of kings. Go on, and you willfail. Never will I cease to dog your footsteps. Lust or malice or anger willbetray you at last in some unwary moment; sooner or later you will be mine.”Very far they rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the landsof his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river. There he cut off his flowinglocks with his sword, removed all his ornaments, and sent them and his horse andsword back to his house by Channa. Then going on he presently met a ragged manand exchanged clothes with him, and so having divested himself of all worldlyentanglements, he was free to pursue his search after wisdom. He made his waysouthward to a resort of hermits and teachers in a hilly spur running intoBengal northward from the Vindhya Mountains, close to the town of Rajgir. Therea number of wise men lived in a warren of caves, going into the town for theirsimple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of mouth to such as caredto come to them.This instruction must have been very much in the style of the Socraticdiscussions that were going on in Athens a couple of centuries later. Gautamabecame versed in all the metaphysics of his age. But his acute intelligence wasdissatisfied with the solutions offered him.The Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and knowledge maybe obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting, sleeplessness, and self-torment,and these ideas Gautama now put to the test. He betook himself with fivedisciple companions to the jungle in a gorge in the Vindhya Mountains, and therehe gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances. His fame spread, “like thesound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the skies.”2[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en96] But it brought him no sense of truthachieved. One day he was walking up and down, trying to think in spite of hisenfeebled state. Suddenly he staggered and fell unconscious. When he recovered,the preposterousness of these semi-magic ways of attempting wisdom was plain tohim.He amazed and horrified his five companions by demanding ordinary food andrefusing to continue his self-mortifications. He had realized that whatevertruth a man may reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.Such a conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age. Hisdisciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to Benares. The boomof the great bell ceased. Gautama the wonderful had fallen.For a time Gautama wandered alone, the loneliest figure in history, battling forlight.When the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes itsadvances, it secures its positions step by step, with but little realization ofthe gains it has made, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, itrealizes its victory. So it would seem it happened to Gautama. He had seatedhimself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this sense ofclear vision came to him. It seemed to him that he saw life plain. He is said tohave sat all day and all night in profound thought, and then he rose up toimpart his vision to the world.§ 2Such is the plain story of Gautama as we gather it from a comparison of earlywritings. But common men must have their cheap marvels and wonders.It is nothing to them that this little planet should at last produce upon itssurface a man thinking of the past and the future and the essential nature ofexistence. And so we must have this sort of thing by some worthy Pali scribe,making the most of it:“When the conflict began between the Saviour of the World and the Prince of Evila thousand appalling meteors fell. . . . Rivers flowed back towards theirsources; peaks and lofty mountains where countless trees had grown for agesrolled crumbling to the earth . . . the sun enveloped itself in awful darkness,and a host of headless spirits filled the air.”3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en97]Of which phenomena history has preserved no authentication. Instead we have onlythe figure of a lonely man walking towards Benares.Extraordinary attention has been given to the tree under which Gautama had thissense of mental clarity. It was a tree of the fig genus, and from the first itwas treated with peculiar veneration. It was called the Bo Tree. It has longsince perished, but close at hand lives another great tree which may be itsdescendant, and in Ceylon there grows to this day a tree, the oldest historicaltree in the world, which we know certainly to have been planted as a cuttingfrom the Bo Tree in the year 245 BC. From that time to this it has beencarefully tended and watered; its great branches are supported by pillars, andthe earth has been terraced up about it so that it has been able to put outfresh roots continually. It helps us to realize the shortness of all humanhistory to see so many generations spanned by the endurance of one single tree.Gautama’s disciples unhappily have cared more for the preservation of his treethan of his thought, which from the first they misconceived and distorted.At Benares Gautama sought out his five pupils, who were still leading theascetic life. There is an account of their hesitation to receive him when theysaw him approaching. He was a backslider. But there was some power ofpersonality in him that prevailed over their coldness, and he made them listento his new convictions. For five days the discussion was carried on. When he hadat last convinced them that he was now enlightened, they hailed him as theBuddha. There was already in those days a belief in India that at long intervalsWisdom returned to the earth and was revealed to mankind through a chosen personknown as the Buddha. According to Indian belief there have been many suchBuddhas; Gautama Buddha is only the latest one of a series. But it is doubtfulif he himself accepted that title or recognized that theory. In his discourseshe never called himself the Buddha.He and his recovered disciples then formed a sort of Academy in the Deer Park atBenares. They made themselves huts, and accumulated other followers to thenumber of threescore or more. In the rainy season they remained in discourse atthis settlement, and during the dry weather they dispersed about the country,each giving his version of the new teachings. All their teaching was done, itwould seem, by word of mouth. There was probably no writing yet in India at all.We must remember that in the time of Buddha it is doubtful if even the Iliad hadbeen committed to writing. Probably the Mediterranean alphabet, which is thebasis of most Indian scripts, had not yet reached India. The master, therefore,worked out and composed pithy and brief verses, aphorisms, and lists of“points,” and these were expanded in the discourse of his disciples. It greatlyhelped them to have these points and aphorisms numbered. The modern mind is aptto be impatient of the tendency of Indian thought to a numerical statement ofthings, the Eightfold Path, the Four Truths, and so on, but this enumeration wasa mnemonic necessity in an undocumented world.§ 3The fundamental teaching of Gautama, as it is now being made plain to us by thestudy of original sources, is clear and simple and in the closest harmony withmodern ideas. It is beyond all dispute the achievement of one of the mostpenetrating intelligences the world has ever known.We have what are almost certainly the authentic heads of his discourse to thefive disciples which embodies his essential doctrine. All the miseries anddiscontents of life he traces to insatiable selfishness. Suffering, he teaches,is due to the craving individuality, to the torment of greedy desire. Until aman has overcome every sort of personal craving his life is trouble and his endsorrow. There are three principal forms the craving of life takes, and all areevil. The first is the desire to gratify the senses, sensuousness. The second isthe desire for personal immortality. The third is the desire for prosperity,worldliness. All these must be overcome—that is to say, a man must no longer beliving for himself—before life can become serene. But when they are indeedovercome and no longer rule a man’s life, when the first personal pronoun hasvanished from his private thoughts, then he has reached the higher wisdom,Nirvana, serenity of soul. For Nirvana does not mean, as many people wronglybelieve, extinction, but the extinction of the futile personal aims thatnecessarily make life base or pitiful or dreadful.Now here, surely we have the completest analysis of the problem of the soul’speace. Every religion that is worth the name, every philosophy, warns us to loseourselves in something greater than ourselves. “Whosoever would save his life,shall lose it”; there is exactly the same lesson.The teaching of history, as we are unfolding it in this book, is strictly inaccordance with this teaching of Buddha. There is, as we are seeing, no socialorder, no security, no peace or happiness, no righteous leadership or kingship,unless men lose themselves in something greater than themselves. The study ofbiological progress again reveals exactly the same process—the merger of thenarrow globe of the individual experience in a wider being (compare what hasbeen said in Chaps. XI and XVI). To forget oneself in greater interests is toescape from a prison.The self-abnegation must be complete. From the point of view of Gautama, thatdread of death, that greed for an endless continuation of his mean littleindividual life which drove the Egyptian and those who learnt from him withpropitiations and charms into the temples, was as mortal and ugly and evil athing as lust or avarice or hate. The religion of Gautama is flatly opposite tothe “immortality” religions. And his teaching is set like flint againstasceticism, as a mere attempt to win personal power by personal pains.But when we come to the rule of life, the Aryan Path, by which we are to escapefrom the threefold base cravings that dishonour human life, then the teaching isnot so clear. It is not so clear for one very manifest reason, Gautama had noknowledge nor vision of history; he had no clear sense of the vast andmany-sided adventure of life opening out in space and time. His mind wasconfined within the ideas of his age and people, and their minds were shapedinto notions of perpetual recurrence, of world following world and of Buddhafollowing Buddha, a stagnant circling of the universe. The idea of mankind as agreat Brotherhood pursuing an endless destiny under the God of Righteousness,the idea that was already dawning upon the Semitic consciousness in Babylon atthis time, did not exist in his world. Yet his account of the Eightfold Path is,nevertheless, within these limitations, profoundly wise.Let us briefly recapitulate the eight elements of the Aryan Path. First, RightViews; Gautama placed the stern examination of views and ideas, the insistenceupon truth as the first research of his followers. There was to be no clingingto tawdry superstitions. He condemned, for instance, the prevalent belief in thetransmigration of souls. In a well-known early Buddhist dialogue there is adestructive analysis of the idea of an enduring individual soul. Next to RightViews came Right Aspirations; because nature abhors a vacuum, and since basecravings are to be expelled, other desires must be encouraged—love for theservice of others, desire to do and secure justice and the like. Primitive anduncorrupted Buddhism aimed not at the destruction of desire, but at the changeof desire. Devotion to science and art, or to the betterment of thingsmanifestly falls into harmony with the Buddhistic Right Aspirations, providedsuch aims are free from jealousy or the craving for fame. Right Speech, RightConduct, and Right Livelihood, need no expansion here. Sixthly in this list cameRight Effort, for Gautama had no toleration for good intentions and slovenlyapplication; the disciple had to keep a keenly critical eye upon his activities.The seventh element of the path, Right Mindfulness, is the constant guardagainst a lapse into personal feeling or glory for whatever is done or not done.And, finally, comes Right Rapture, which seems to be aimed against the pointlessecstacies of the devout, such witless gloryings, for instance, as those thatwent to the jingle of the Alexandrian sistrum.We will not discuss here the Buddhistic doctrine of Karma, because it belongs toa world of thought that is passing away. The good or evil of every life wassupposed to determine the happiness or misery of some subsequent life, that wasin some inexplicable way identified with its predecessor. Nowadays we realizethat a life goes on in its consequences forever, but we find no necessity tosuppose that any particular life resumes again. The Indian mind was full of theidea of cyclic recurrence; everything was supposed to come round again. This isa very natural supposition for men to make; so things seem to be until weanalyze them. Modern science has made clear to us that there is no such exactrecurrence as we are apt to suppose; everyday is by an infinitesimal quantity alittle longer than the day before; no generation repeats the previous generationprecisely; history never repeats itself; change, we realize now, isinexhaustible; all things are eternally new. But these differences between ourgeneral ideas and those Buddha must have possessed need not in any way preventus from appreciating the unprecedented wisdom, the goodness, and the greatnessof this plan of an emancipated life as Gautama laid it down somewhen in thesixth century before Christ.And if he failed in theory to gather together all the wills of the convertedinto the one multifarious activity of our race, battling against death anddeadness in time and space, he did in practice direct his own life and that ofall his immediate disciples into one progressive adventure, which was to preachand spread the doctrine and methods of Nirvana or soul-serenity throughout ourfevered world. For them at least his teaching was complete and full. But all mencannot preach or teach; doctrine is but one of many of the functions of lifethat are fundamentally righteous. To the modern mind it seems at least equallyacceptable that a man may, though perhaps against greater difficulties,cultivate the soil, rule a city, make roads, build houses, construct engines, orseek and spread knowledge, in perfect self-forgetfulness and serenity. As muchwas inherent in Gautama’s teaching, but the stress was certainly laid upon theteaching itself, and upon withdrawal from rather than upon the ennoblement ofthe ordinary affairs of men.In certain other respects this primitive Buddhism differed from any of thereligions we have hitherto considered. It was primarily a religion of conduct,not a religion of observances and sacrifices. It had no temples, and since ithad no sacrifices, it had no sacred order of priests. Nor had it any theology.It neither asserted nor denied the reality of the innumerable and oftengrotesque gods who were worshipped in India at that time. It passed them by.§ 4From the very first this new teaching was misconceived. One corruption wasperhaps inherent in its teaching. Because the world of men had as yet no senseof the continuous progressive effort of life, it was very easy to slip from theidea of renouncing self to the idea of renouncing active life. As Gautama’s ownexperiences had shown, it is easier to flee from this world than from self. Hisearly disciples were strenuous thinkers and teachers, but the lapse into meremonastic seclusion was a very easy one, particularly easy in the climate ofIndia, where an extreme simplicity of living is convenient and attractive, andexertion more laborious than anywhere else in the world.And it was early the fate of Gautama, as it has been the fate of most religiousfounders since his days, to be made into a wonder by his less intelligentdisciples in their efforts to impress the outer world. We have already noted howone devout follower could not but believe that the moment of the master’s mentalirradiation must necessarily have been marked by an epileptic fit of theelements. This is one small sample of the vast accumulation of vulgar marvelsthat presently sprang up about the memory of Gautama.There can be no doubt that for the great multitude of human beings then as nowthe mere idea of an emancipation from self is a very difficult one to grasp. Itis probable that even among the teachers Buddha was sending out from Benaresthere were many who did not grasp it and still less were able to convey it totheir hearers. Their teaching quite naturally took on the aspect of salvationnot from oneself—that idea was beyond them—but from misfortunes and sufferingshere and hereafter. In the existing superstitions of the people, and especiallyin the idea of the transmigration of the soul after death, though this idea wascontrary to the Master’s own teaching, they found stuff of fear they could workupon. They urged virtue upon the people lest they should live again in degradedor miserable forms, or fall into some one of the innumerable hells of tormentwith which the Brahminical teachers had already familiarized their minds. Theyrepresented Buddha as the saviour from almost unlimited torment.There seems to be no limit to the lies that honest but stupid disciples willtell for the glory of their master and for what they regard as the success oftheir propaganda. Men who would scorn to tell a lie in everyday life will becomeunscrupulous cheats and liars when they have given themselves up to propagandistwork; it is one of the perplexing absurdities of our human nature. Such honestsouls, for most of them were indubitably honest, were presently telling theirhearers of the miracles that attended the Buddha’s birth—they no longer calledhim Gautama, because that was too familiar a name—of his youthful feats ofstrength, of the marvels of his everyday life, winding up with a sort ofillumination of his body at the moment of death. Of course it was impossible tobelieve that Buddha was the son of a mortal father. He was miraculouslyconceived through his mother dreaming of a beautiful white elephant! Previouslyhe had himself been a marvellous elephant with six tusks; he had generouslygiven them all to a needy hunter—and even helped him to saw them off. And so on.140 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_140_r1.gif]Moreover, a theology grew up about Buddha. He was discovered to be a god. He wasone of a series of divine beings, the Buddhas. There was an undying “Spirit ofall the Buddhas”; there was a great series of Buddhas past and Buddhas (orBuddisatvas) yet to come. But we cannot go further into these complications ofAsiatic theology. “Under the overpowering influence of these sickly imaginationsthe moral teachings of Gautama have been almost hid from view. The theories grewand flourished; each new step, each new hypothesis, demanded another; until thewhole sky was filled with forgeries of the brain, and the nobler and simplerlessons of the founder of the religion were smothered beneath the glitteringmass of metaphysical subtleties.”4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en98]In the third century BC Buddhism was gaining wealth and power, and the littlegroups of simple huts in which the teachers of the Order gathered in the rainyseason were giving place to substantial monastic buildings. To this periodbelong the beginnings of Buddhistic art. Now if we remember how recent was theadventure of Alexander, that all the Punjab was still under Seleucid rule, thatall India abounded with Greek adventurers, and that there was still quite opencommunication by sea and land with Alexandria, it is no great wonder to findthat this early Buddhist art was strongly Greek in character, and that the newAlexandrian cult of Serapis and Isis was extraordinarily influential in itsdevelopment.The kingdom of Gandhara on the northwest frontier near Peshawar, whichflourished in the third century BC, was a typical meeting-place of the Hellenicand Indian worlds. Here are to be found the earliest Buddhist sculptures, andinterwoven with them are figures which are recognizably the figures of Serapisand Isis and Horus already worked into the legendary net that gathered aboutBuddha. No doubt the Greek artists who came to Gandhara were loth to relinquisha familiar theme. But Isis, we are told, is no longer Isis but Hariti, apestilence goddess whom Buddha converted and made benevolent. Foucher tracesIsis from this centre into China, but here other influences were also at work,and the story becomes too complex for us to disentangle in this Outline.5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en99] China had a Taoist deity, the HolyMother, the Queen of Heaven, who took on the name (originally a male name) ofKuan-yin and who came to resemble the Isis figure very closely. The Isisfigures, we feel, must have influenced the treatment of Kuan-yin. Like Isis shewas also Queen of the Seas, Stella Maris. In Japan she was called Kwannon. Thereseems to have been a constant exchange of the outer forms of religion betweeneast and west. We read in Huc’s Travels how perplexing he and his fellowmissionary found this possession of a common tradition of worship. “The cross,”he says,. . . the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope, which the Grand Lamas wear on theirjourneys, or when they are performing some ceremony out of the temple; theservice with double choirs, the psalmody, the exorcisms, the censer, suspendedfrom five chains, which you can open or close at pleasure; the benedictionsgiven by the Lamas by extending the right hand over the heads of the faithful;the chaplet, ecclesiastical celibacy, spiritual retirement, the worship of thesaints, the fasts, the processions, the litanies, the holy water, all these areanalogies between the Buddhists and ourselves.6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en100]The cult and doctrine of Gautama, gathering corruptions and variations fromBrahminism and Hellenism alike, was spread throughout India by an increasingmultitude of teachers in the fourth and third centuries BC. For some generationsat least it retained much of the moral beauty and something of the simplicity ofthe opening phase. Many people who have no intellectual grasp upon the meaningof self-abnegation and disinterestedness have nevertheless the ability toappreciate a splendour in the reality of these qualities. Early Buddhism wascertainly producing noble lives, and it is not only through reason that thelatent response to nobility is aroused in our minds. It spread rather in spiteof than because of the concessions that it made to vulgar imaginations. Itspread because many of the early Buddhists were sweet and gentle, helpful andnoble and admirable people, who compelled belief in their sustaining faith.Quite early in its career Buddhism came into conflict with the growingpretensions of the Brahmins. As we have already noted, this priestly caste wasstill only struggling to dominate Indian life in the days of Gautama. They hadalready great advantages. They had the monopoly of tradition and religioussacrifices. But their power was being challenged by the development of kingship,for the men who became clan leaders and kings were usually not of theBrahminical caste.Kingship received an impetus from the Persian and Greek invasions of the Punjab.We have already noted the name of King Porus whom, in spite of his elephants,Alexander defeated and turned into a satrap. There came also to the Greek campupon the Indus a certain adventurer named Chandragupta Maurya, whom the Greekscalled Sandracottus, with a scheme for conquering the Ganges country. The schemewas not welcome to the Macedonians, who were in revolt against marching anyfurther into India, and he had to fly the camp. He wandered among the tribesupon the northwest frontier, secured their support, and after Alexander haddeparted, overran the Punjab, ousting the Macedonian representatives. He thenconquered the Ganges country (321 BC), waged a successful war (303 BC) againstSeleucus (Seleucus I) when the latter attempted to recover the Punjab, andconsolidated a great empire reaching across all the plain of northern India fromthe western to the eastern sea. And this King Chandragupta came into much thesame conflict with the growing power of the Brahmins, into the conflict betweencrown and priesthood, that we have already noted as happening in Babylonia andEgypt and China. He saw in the spreading doctrine of Buddhism an ally againstthe growth of priestcraft and caste. He supported and endowed the BuddhisticOrder, and encouraged its teachings.141 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_141_r1.gif]He was succeeded by his son, who conquered Madras and was in turn succeeded byAsoka (264 to 227 BC), one of the great monarchs of history, whose dominionsextended from Afghanistan to Madras. He is the only military monarch on recordwho abandoned warfare after victory. He had invaded Kalinga (255 BC), a countryalong the east coast of Madras, perhaps with some intention of completing theconquest of the tip of the Indian peninsula. The expedition was successful, buthe was disgusted by what he saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. Hedeclared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seekconquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to thespreading of Buddhism throughout the world.142 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_142_r1.gif]He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. He wasno mere religious fanatic. But in the year of his one and only war he joined theBuddhist community as a layman, and some years later he became a full member ofthe Order, and devoted himself to the attainment of Nirvana by the EightfoldPath. How entirely compatible that way of living then was with the most usefuland beneficent activities his life shows. Right Aspiration, Right Effort, andRight Livelihood distinguished his career. He organized a great digging of wellsin India, and the planting of trees for shade. He appointed officers for thesupervision of charitable works. He founded hospitals and public gardens. He hadgardens made for the growing of medicinal herbs. Had he had an Aristotle toinspire him, he would no doubt have endowed scientific research upon a greatscale. He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines and subject races.He made provision for the education of women. He made, he was the first monarchto make, an attempt to educate his people into a common view of the ends and wayof life. He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist teaching orders, and tried tostimulate them to a better study of their own literature. All over the land heset up long inscriptions rehearsing the teaching of Gautama, and it is thesimple and human teaching and not the preposterous accretions. Thirty-five ofhis inscriptions survive to this day. Moreover, he sent missionaries to spreadthe noble and reasonable teaching of his master throughout the world, toKashmir, to Ceylon, to the Seleucids, and the Ptolemies. It was one of thesemissions which carried that cutting of the Bo Tree, of which we have alreadytold, to Ceylon.For eight and twenty years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men. Amidstthe tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history,their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and thelike, the name of Asoka shines, and shines almost alone, a star. From the Volgato Japan his name is still honoured. China, Tibet, and even India, though it hasleft his doctrine, preserve the tradition of his greatness. More living mencherish his memory today than have ever heard the names of Constantine orCharlemagne.§ 5It is thought that the vast benefactions of Asoka finally corrupted Buddhism byattracting to its Order great numbers of mercenary and insincere adherents, butthere can be no doubt that its rapid extension throughout Asia was very largelydue to his stimulus.It made its way into Central Asia through Afghanistan and Turkestan, and soreached China. Buddhist teaching had spread widely in China before 200 BC.Buddhism found there a popular and prevalent religion, Taoism, a development ofvery ancient and primitive magic and occult practices. It was reorganized as adistinctive cult by Chang Daoling in the days of the Han dynasty. Tao means theWay, which corresponds closely with the idea of the Aryan Path. The tworeligions spread side by side and underwent similar changes, so that nowadaystheir outward practice is very similar. Buddhism also encountered Confucianism,which was even less theological and even more a code of personal conduct. Andfinally it encountered the teachings of Lao Tse, “anarchist, evolutionist,pacifist and moral philosopher,”7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en101]which were not so much a religion as a philosophical rule of life. The teachingsof this Lao Tse were later to become incorporated with the Taoist religion byChen Tuan, the founder of modern Taoism.Confucius, the founder of Confucianism, like the great southern teacher Lao Tseand Gautama, lived also in the sixth century BC. His life has some interestingparallelisms with that of some of the more political of the Greek philosophersof the fifth and fourth. The sixth century BC falls into the period assigned byChinese historians to the Chow Dynasty, but in those days the rule of thatdynasty had become little more than nominal; the emperor conducted thetraditional sacrifices of the Son of Heaven, and received a certain formalrespect. Even his nominal empire was not a sixth part of the China of today. Inchapter 14 we have already glanced at the state of affairs in China at thistime; practically China was a multitude of warring states open to the northernbarbarians. Confucius was a subject in one of those states, Lu; he was ofaristocratic birth, but poor; and, after occupying various official positions,he set up a sort of Academy in Lu for the discovery and imparting of Wisdom. Andwe also find Confucius travelling from state to state in China, seeking a princewho would make him his counsellor and become the centre of a reformed world.Plato, two centuries later, in exactly the same spirit, went as adviser to thetyrant Dionysius of Syracuse, and we have already noted the attitudes ofAristotle and Isocrates towards Philip of Macedonia.The teaching of Confucius centred upon the idea of a noble life which heembodied in a standard or ideal, the Aristocratic Man. This phrase is oftentranslated into English as the Superior Person, but as “superior” and “person,”like “respectable” and “genteel,” have long become semi-humorous terms of abuse,this rendering is not fair to Confucianism. He did present to his time the idealof a devoted public man. The public side was very important to him. He was farmore of a constructive political thinker than Gautama or Lao Tse. His mind wasfull of the condition of China, and he sought to call the Aristocratic Man intoexistence very largely in order to produce the noble state. One of his sayingsmay be quoted here: “It is impossible to withdraw from the world, and associatewith birds and beasts that have no affinity with us. With whom should Iassociate but with suffering men? The disorder that prevails is what requires myefforts. If right principles ruled through the kingdom, there would be nonecessity for me to change its state.”143 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_143_r1.gif]The political basis of his teaching seems to be characteristic of Chinese moralideas; there is a much directer reference to the State than is the case withmost Indian and European moral and religious doctrine. For a time he wasappointed magistrate in Chung-tu, a city of the dukedom of Lu, and here hesought to regulate life to an extraordinary extent, to subdue every relationshipand action indeed to the rule of an elaborate etiquette. “Ceremonial in everydetail, such as we are wont to see only in the courts of rulers and thehouseholds of high dignitaries, became obligatory on the people at large, andall matters of daily life were subject to rigid rule. Even the food which thedifferent classes of people might eat was regulated; males and females were keptapart in the streets; even the thickness of coffins and the shape and situationof graves were made the subject of regulations.”8[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en102]This is all, as people say, very Chinese. No other people have ever approachedmoral order and social stability through the channel of manners. Yet in China,at any rate, the methods of Confucius have had an enormous effect, and no nationin the world today has such a universal tradition of decorum and self-restraint.Later on the influence of Confucius over his duke was undermind, and he withdrewagain into private life. His last days were saddened by the deaths of some ofhis most promising disciples. “No intelligent ruler,” he said, “arises to takeme as his master, and my time has come to die. . . .”But he died to live. Says Hirth,There can be no doubt that Confucius has had a greater influence on thedevelopment of the Chinese national character than many emperors taken together.He is, therefore, one of the essential figures to be considered in connectionwith any history of China. That he could influence his nation to such a degreewas, it appears to me, due more to the peculiarity of the nation than to that ofhis own personality. Had he lived in any other part of the world, his name wouldperhaps be forgotten. As we have seen, he had formed his character and hispersonal views on man’s life from a careful study of documents closely connectedwith the moral philosophy cultivated by former generations. What he preached tohis contemporaries was, therefore, not all new to them; but, having himself, inthe study of old records, heard the dim voice of the sages of the past, hebecame, as it were, the megaphone phonograph through which were expressed to thenation those views which he had derived from the early development of the nationitself. . . . The great influence of Confucius’ personality on national life inChina was due not only to his writings and his teachings as recorded by others,but also to his doings. His personal character, as described by his disciplesand in the accounts of later writers, some of which may be entirely legendary,has become the pattern for millions of those who are bent on imitating theoutward manners of a great man. . . . Whatever he did in public was regulated tothe minutest detail by ceremony. This was no invention of his own, sinceceremonial life had been cultivated many centuries before Confucius; but hisauthority and example did much to perpetuate what he considered desirable socialpractices.The Chinese speak of Buddhism and the doctrines of Lao Tse and Confucius as theThree Teachings. Together they constitute the basis and point of departure ofall later Chinese thought. Their thorough study is a necessary preliminary tothe establishment of any real intellectual and moral community between the greatpeople of the East and the Western world.There are certain things to be remarked in common of all these three teachers,of whom Gautama was indisputably the greatest and profoundest, whose doctrinesto this day dominate the thought of the great majority of human beings; thereare certain features in which their teaching contrasts with the thoughts andfeelings that were soon to take possession of the Western world. Primarily theyare personal and tolerant doctrines; they are doctrines of a Way, of a Path, ofa Nobility, and not doctrines of a church or a general rule. And they offernothing either for or against the existence and worship of the current gods. TheAthenian philosophers, it is to be noted, had just the same theologicaldetachment! Socrates was quite willing to bow politely or sacrifice formally toalmost any divinity—reserving his private thoughts. This attitude is flatlyantagonistic to the state of mind that was growing up in the Jewish communitiesof Judea, Egypt, and Babylonia, in which the thought of the one God was firstand foremost. Neither Gautama nor Lao Tse nor Confucius had any inkling of thisidea of a jealous God, a God who would have “none other gods,” a God of terribleTruth, who would not tolerate any lurking belief in magic, witchcraft, or oldcustoms, or any sacrificing to the god-king or any trifling with the stern unityof things.§ 6The intolerance of the Jewish mind did keep its essential faith clear and clean.The theological disregard of the great Eastern teachers, neither assenting nordenying, did on the other hand permit elaborations of explanation andaccumulations of ritual from the very beginning. Except for Gautama’s insistenceupon Right Views, which was easily disregarded, there was no self-cleansingelement in either Buddhism, Taoism, or Confucianism. There was no effectiveprohibition of superstitious practices, spirit raising, incantations,prostrations, and supplementary worships. At an early stage a process ofencrustation began, and continued. The new faiths caught almost every disease ofthe corrupt religions they sought to replace; they took over the idols and thetemples, the altars and the censers.Tibet today is a Buddhistic country, yet Gautama, could he return to earth,might go from end to end of Tibet seeking his own teaching in vain. He wouldfind that most ancient type of human ruler, a god-king, enthroned, the DalaiLama, the “living Buddha.” At Lhassa he would find a huge temple filled withpriests, abbots, and lamas—he whose only buildings were huts and who made nopriests—and above a high altar he would behold a huge golden idol, which hewould learn was called “Gautama Buddha”! He would hear services intoned beforethis divinity, and certain precepts, which would be dimly familiar to him,murmured as responses. Bells, incense, prostrations, would play their part inthese amazing proceedings. At one point in the service a bell would be rung anda mirror lilted up, while the whole congregation, in an access of reverence,bowed lower. . . .About this Buddhist countryside he would discover a number of curious littlemechanisms, little wind-wheels and waterwheels spinning, on which brief prayerswere inscribed. Everytime these things spin, he would learn, it counts as aprayer. “To whom?” he would ask. Moreover, there would be a number of flagstaffsin the land carrying beautiful silk flags, silk flags which bore the perplexinginscription, “Om Mani padme hum,” “the jewel is in the lotus.” Whenever the flagflaps, he would learn, it was a prayer also, very beneficial to the gentlemanwho paid for the flag and to the land generally. Gangs of workmen, employed bypious persons, would be going about the country cutting this precious formula oncliff and stone. And this, he would realize at last, was what the world had madeof his religion! Beneath this gaudy glitter was buried the Aryan Way to serenityof soul.We have already noted the want of any progressive idea in primitive Buddhism. Inthat again it contrasted with Judaism. The idea of a Promise gave to Judaism aquality no previous or contemporary religion displayed; it made Judaismhistorical and dramatic. It justified its fierce intolerance because it pointedto an aim. In spite of the truth and profundity of the psychological side ofGautama’s teaching, Buddhism stagnated and corrupted for the lack of thatdirective idea. Judaism, it must be confessed, in its earlier phases, enteredbut little into the souls of men; it let them remain lustful, avaricious,worldly or superstitious; but because of its persuasion of a promise and of adivine leadership to serve divine ends, it remained in comparison with Buddhismbright and expectant, like a cared-for sword.§ 7For sometime Buddhism flourished in India. But Brahminism, with its many godsand its endless variety of cults, always flourished by its side, and theorganization of the Brahmins grew more powerful, until at last they were able toturn upon this caste-denying cult and oust it from India altogether. The storyof that struggle is not to be told here; there were persecutions and reactions,but by the eleventh century, except for Orissa, Buddhist teaching was extinct inIndia. Much of its gentleness and charity had, however, become incorporated withBrahminism.Over great areas of the world, as our map has shown, it still survives; and itis quite possible that in contact with western science, and inspired by thespirit of history, the original teaching of Gautama, revived and purified, mayyet play a large part in the direction of human destiny.But with the loss of India the Aryan Way ceased to rule the lives of any Aryanpeoples. It is curious to note that while the one great Aryan religion is nowalmost exclusively confined to Mongolian peoples, the Aryans themselves areunder the sway of two religions, Christianity and Islam, which are, as we shallsee, essentially Semitic. And both Buddhism and Christianity wear garments ofritual and formula that seem to be derived through Hellenistic channels fromthat land of temples and priestcraft, Egypt, and from the more primitive andfundamental mentality of the brown Hamitic peoples.144 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_144_r1.gif]"},{"pageContent":"145 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_145_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX 146[bano_9781411428843_oeb_146_r1.gif]THE TWO WESTERN REPUBLICS§ 1.

THE THIRD PUNIC WAR. §8. HOW THE PUNIC WAR UNDERMINED ROMAN LIBERTY. § 9. COMPARISON OF THE ROMANREPUBLIC WITH A MODERN STATE.§ 1IT IS NOW NECESSARY TO TAKE UP THE HISTORY OF THE TWO GREAT republics of theWestern Mediterranean, Rome and Carthage, and to tell how Rome succeeded inmaintaining for some centuries an empire even greater than that achieved by theconquests of Alexander. But this new empire was, as we shall try to make clear,a political structure differing very profoundly in its nature from any of thegreat Oriental empires that had preceded it. Great changes in the texture ofhuman society and in the conditions of social interrelations had been going onfor some centuries. The flexibility and transferability of money was becoming apower and, like all powers in inexpert hands, a danger in human affairs. It wasaltering the relations of rich men to the state and to their poorer fellowcitizens. This new empire, the Roman empire, unlike all the preceding empires,was not the creation of a great conqueror. No Sargon, no Thothmes, noNebuchadnezzar, no Cyrus nor Alexander nor Chandragupta, was its fountain head.It was made by a republic. It grew by a kind of necessity through newconcentrating and unifying forces that were steadily gathering power in humanaffairs.But first it is necessary to give some idea of the state of affairs in Italy inthe centuries immediately preceding the appearance of Rome in the world’s story.Before 1200 BC, that is to say before the rise of the Assyrian empire, the siegeof Troy, and the final destruction of Cnossos, but after the time of AmenophisIV, Italy, like Spain, was probably still inhabited mainly by dark white peopleof the more fundamental Iberian or Mediterranean race. This aboriginalpopulation was probably a thin and backward one. But already in Italy, as inGreece, the Aryans were coming southward. By 1000 BC immigrants from the northhad settled over most of the north and centre of Italy, and, as in Greece, theyhad intermarried with their darker predecessors and established a group of Aryanlanguages, the Italian group, more akin to the Keltic (Gaelic) than to anyother, of which the most interesting from the historical point of view was thatspoken by the Latin tribes in the plains south and east of the river Tiber.Meanwhile the Greeks had been settling down in Greece, and now they were takingto the sea and crossing over to South Italy and Sicily and establishingthemselves there. Subsequently they established colonies along the FrenchRiviera and founded Marseilles upon the site of an older Phœnician colony.Another interesting people also had come into Italy by sea. These were abrownish sturdy people, to judge from the pictures they have left of themselves;very probably they were a tribe of those Ægean “dark whites” who were beingdriven out of Greece and Asia Minor147 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_147_r1.gif]and the islands in between by the Greeks. We have already told the tale ofCnossos (chapter 15) and of the settlement of the kindred Philistines inPalestine (chapter 19, § 1). These Etruscans, as they were called in Italy,148 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_148_r1.gif]were known even in ancient times to be of Asiatic origin, and it is tempting,but probably unjustifiable, to connect this tradition with the Æneid, the shamepic of the Latin poet Virgil, in which the Latin civilization is ascribed toTrojan immigrants from Asia Minor. (But the Trojans themselves were probably anAryan people allied to the Phrygians). These Etruscan people conquered most ofItaly north of the Tiber from the Aryan tribes who were scattered over thatcountry. Probably the Etruscans ruled over a subjugated Italian population, soreversing the state of affairs in Greece, in which the Aryans were uppermost.Our map, which may be taken to represent roughly the state of affairs about 750BC, also shows the establishments of the Phœnician traders, of which Carthagewas the chief, along the shores of Africa and Spain.149 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_149_r1.gif]Of all the peoples actually in Italy, the Etruscans were by far the mostcivilized. They built sturdy fortresses of the Mycænean type of architecture;they had a metal industry; they used imported Greek pottery of a very fine type.The Latin tribes on the other side of the Tiber were by comparison barbaric.The Latins were still a rude farming people. The centre of their worship was atemple to the tribal god Jupiter, upon the Alban Mount. There they gathered fortheir chief festivals very much after the fashion of the early tribal gatheringwe have already imagined at Avebury. This gathering place was not a town. It wasa high place of assembly. There was no population permanently there. There were,however, twelve townships in the Latin league. At one point upon the Tiber therewas a ford, and here there was a trade between Latins and Etruscans. At thisford Rome had its beginnings. Traders assembled there, and refugees from thetwelve towns found an asylum and occupation at this trading centre. Upon theseven hills near the ford a number of settlements sprang up, which finallyamalgamated into one city.Most people have heard the story of the two brothers Romulus and Remus, whofounded Rome, and the legend of how they were exposed as infants and shelteredand suckled by a wolf. Little value is now attached to this tale by modernhistorians. The date 753 BC is given for the founding of Rome, but there areEtruscan tombs beneath the Roman Forum of a much earlier date than that, and theso-called tomb of Romulus bears an indecipherable Etruscan inscription.The peninsula of Italy was not then the smiling land of vineyards and oliveorchards it has since become. It was still a rough country of marsh and forest,in which the farmers grazed their cattle and made their clearings. Rome, on theboundary between Latin and Etruscan, was not in a very strong position fordefence. At first there were perhaps Latin kings in Rome, then it would seem thecity fell into the hands of Etruscan rulers whose tyrannous conduct led at lastto their expulsion, and Rome became a Latin-speaking republic. The Etruscankings were expelled from Rome in the sixth century BC, while the successors ofNebuchadnezzar were ruling by the sufferance of the Medes in Babylon, whileConfucius was seeking a king to reform the disorders of China, and while Gautamawas teaching the Aryan Way to his disciples at Benares.Of the struggle between the Romans and the Etruscans we cannot tell in anydetail here. The Etruscans were the better armed, the more civilized, and themore numerous, and it would probably have gone hard with the Romans if they hadhad to fight them alone. But two disasters happened to the Etruscans which soweakened them that the Romans were able at last to master them altogether. Thefirst of these was a war with the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily which destroyedthe Etruscan fleet (474 BC), and the second was a great raid of the Gauls fromthe north into Italy. These latter people swarmed into North Italy and occupiedthe valley of the Po towards the end of the fifth century BC, as a couple ofcenturies later their kindred were to swarm down into Greece and Asia Minor andsettle in Galatia. The Etruscans were thus caught between hammer and anvil, andafter a long and intermittent war the Romans were able to capture Veii, anEtruscan fortress, a few miles from Rome, which had hitherto been a great threatand annoyance to them.It is to this period of struggle against the Etruscan monarchs, the Tarquins,that Macaulay’s Lays of Ancient Rome, familiar to every schoolboy, refer.But the invasion of the Gauls was one of those convulsions of the nations thatleave nothing as it has been before. They carried their raiding right down theItalian peninsula, devastating all Etruria. They took and sacked Rome (390 BC).According to Roman legends—on which doubt is thrown—the citadel on the Capitolheld out, and this also the Gauls would have taken by surprise at night, ifcertain geese had not been awakened by their stealthy movements and set up sucha cackling as to arouse the garrison. After that the Gauls, who wereill-equipped for siege operations, and perhaps suffering from disease in theircamp, were bought off, and departed to the northward again, and, though theymade subsequent raids, they never again reached Rome.The leader of the Gauls who sacked Rome was named Brennus. It is related of himthat as the gold of the ransom was being weighed, there was some dispute aboutthe justice of the counterpoise, whereupon he flung his sword into the scale,saying, “Vœ victis! ” (“Woe to the vanquished!”) a phrase that has haunted thediscussions of all subsequent ransoms and indemnities down to the present time.For half a century after this experience Rome was engaged in a series of wars toestablish herself at the head of the Latin tribes. For the burning of the chiefcity seems to have stimulated rather than crippled her energies. However muchshe had suffered, most of her neighbours seem to have suffered more. By 290 BCRome was the mistress city of all Central Italy from the Arno to south ofNaples. She had conquered the Etruscans altogether, and her boundaries marchedwith those of the Gauls to the north and with the regions of Italy under Greekdominion (Magna Græcia) to the south. Along the Gaulish boundary she had plantedgarrisons and colonial cities, and no doubt it was because of that line ofdefence that the raiding enterprises of the Gauls were deflected eastward intothe Balkans.After what we have already told of the history of Greece and the constitutionsof her cities, it will not surprise the reader to learn that the Greeks ofSicily and Italy were divided up into a number of separate city governments, ofwhich Syracuse and Tarentum (the modern Taranto) were the chief, and that theyhad no common rule of direction or policy. But now, alarmed at the spread of theRoman power, they looked across the Adriatic for help, and found it in theambitions of Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus. Between the Romans and Pyrrhus theseGreeks of Magna Græcia were very much in the same position that Greece properhad been in, between the Macedonians and the Persians half a century before.The reader will remember that Epirus, the part of Greece that is closest to theheel of Italy, was the native land of Olympias, the mother of Alexander. In thekaleidoscopic changes of the map that followed the death of Alexander, Epiruswas sometimes swamped by Macedonia, sometimes independent. This Pyrrhus was akinsman of Alexander the Great, and a monarch of ability and enterprise, and heseems to have planned a career of conquest in Italy and Sicily. He commanded anadmirable army, against which the comparatively inexpert Roman levies could atfirst do little. His army included all the established military devices of thetime, an infantry phalanx, Thessalian cavalry, and twenty fighting elephantsfrom the east. He routed the Romans at Heraclea (280 BC), and, pressing afterthem, defeated them again at Ausculum (279 BC) in their own territory. Then,instead of pursuing the Romans further, he made a truce with them, turned hisattention to the subjugation of Sicily, and so brought the sea power of Carthageinto alliance against him. For Carthage could not afford to have a strong powerestablished so close to her as Sicily. Rome in those days seemed to theCarthaginians a far less serious threat than the possibility of anotherAlexander the Great ruling Sicily. A Carthaginian fleet appeared off the mouthof the Tiber, therefore, to encourage or induce the Romans to renew thestruggle, and Rome and Carthage were definitely allied against the invader.150 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_150_r1.gif]This interposition of Carthage was fatal to Pyrrhus. Without any decisive battlehis power wilted, and, after a disastrous repulse in an attack upon the Romancamp of Beneventum, he had to retire to Epirus (275 BC).It is recorded that when Pyrrhus left Sicily, he said he left it to be thebattleground of Rome and Carthage. He was killed three years later in a battlein the streets of Argos. The war against Pyrrhus was won by the Carthaginianfleet, and Rome reaped a full half of the harvest of victory. Sicily fellcompletely to Carthage, and Rome came down to the toe and heel of Italy, andlooked across the Straits of Messina at her new rival. In eleven years’ time(264 BC) the prophecy of Pyrrhus was fulfilled, and the first war with Carthage,the first of the three Punic1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en103] Wars,had begun.151 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_151_r1.gif]§ 2But we write “Rome” and the “Romans,” and we have still to explain what mannerof people these were who were playing a role of conquest that had hitherto beenplayed only by able and aggressive monarchs.Their state was, in the fifth century BC, a republic of the Aryan type verysimilar to a Greek aristocratic republic. The earliest accounts of the sociallife of Rome give us a picture of a very primitive Aryan community.In the second half of the fifth century before Christ, Rome was still anaristocratic community of free peasants, occupying an area of nearly 400 squaremiles, with a population certainly not exceeding 150,000, almost entirelydispersed over the country-side and divided into seventeen districts or ruraltribes. Most of the families had a small holding and a cottage of their own,where father and sons lived and worked together, growing corn for the most part,with here and there a strip of vine or olive. Their few head of cattle were keptat pasture on the neighbouring common land; their clothes and simple implementsof husbandry they made for themselves at home. Only at rare intervals and onspecial occasions would they make their way into the fortified town, which wasthe centre at once of their religion and their government. Here were the templesof the gods, the houses of the wealthy, and the shops of the artizans andtraders, where corn, oil, or wine could be bartered in small quantities for saltor rough tools and weapons of iron.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en104]152 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_152_r1.gif]This community followed the usual tradition of a division into aristocratic andcommon citizens, who were called in Rome patricians and plebeians. These werethe citizens; the slave or outlander had no more part in the state than he hadin Greece. But the constitution differed from any Greek constitution in the factthat a great part of the ruling power was gathered into the hands of a bodycalled the Senate, which was neither purely a body of hereditary members nordirectly an elected and representative one. It was a nominated one, and in theearlier period it was nominated solely from among the patricians. It existedbefore the expulsion of the kings, and in the time of the kings it was the kingwho nominated the senators. But after the expulsion of the kings (510 BC), thesupreme government was vested in the hands of two elected rulers, the consuls;and it was the consuls who took over the business of appointing senators. In theearly days of the Republic only patricians were eligible as consuls or senators,and the share of the plebeians in the government consisted merely in a right tovote for the consuls and other public officials. Even for that purpose theirvotes did not have the same value as those of their patrician fellow citizens.But their votes had at any rate sufficient weight to induce many of thepatrician candidates to profess a more or less sincere concern for plebeiangrievances. In the early phases of the Roman state, moreover, the plebeians werenot only excluded from public office, but from intermarriage with the patricianclass. The administration was evidently primarily a patrician affair.The early phase of Roman affairs was therefore an aristocracy of a verypronounced type, and the internal history of Rome for the two centuries and ahalf between the expulsion of the last Etruscan king, Tarquin the Proud, and thebeginning of the first Punic War (264 BC), was very largely a struggle formastery between those two orders, the patricians and the plebeians. It was, infact, closely parallel with the struggle of aristocracy and democracy in thecity states of Greece, and, as in the case of Greece, there were whole classesin the community, slaves, freed slaves, unpropertied free men, outlanders, andthe like, who were entirely outside and beneath the struggle. We have alreadynoted the essential difference of Greek democracy and what is called democracyin the world today. Another misused word is the Roman term proletariat, which inmodern jargon means all the unpropertied people in a modern state. In Rome theproletarii were a voting division of fully qualified citizens whose property wasless than 10,000 copper asses (= £275). They were an enrolled class; their valueto the state consisted in their raising families of citizens (proles =offspring), and from their ranks were drawn the colonists who went to form newLatin cities or to garrison important points. But the proletarii were quitedistinct in origin from slaves or freedmen or the miscellaneous driftage of atown slum, and it is a great pity that modern political discussion should beconfused by an inaccurate use of a term which has no exact modern equivalent andwhich expresses nothing real in modern social classification.The mass of the details of this struggle between patricians and plebeians we canafford to ignore in this outline. It was a struggle which showed the Romans tobe a people of a curiously shrewd character, never forcing things to adestructive crisis, but being within the limits of their discretion graspinghard dealers. The patricians made a mean use of their political advantages togrow rich through the national conquests at the expense not only of the defeatedenemy, but of the poorer plebeian, whose farm had been neglected and who hadfallen into debt during his military service. The plebeians were ousted from anyshare in the conquered lands, which the patricians divided up among themselves.The introduction of money probably increased the facilities of the usurer andthe difficulties of the borrowing debtor.Three sorts of pressure won the plebeians a greater share in the government ofthe country and the good things that were coming to Rome as she grew powerful.The first of these1. was the general strike of plebeians. Twice they actually marched right out ofRome, threatening to make a new city higher up the Tiber, and twice this threatproved conclusive. The second method of pressure2. was the threat of a tyranny. Just as in Attica (the little state of whichAthens was the capital), Peisistratus raised himself to power on the support ofthe poorer districts, so there was to be found in most periods of plebeiandiscontent some ambitious man ready to figure as a leader and wrest power fromthe Senate. For a long time the Roman patricians were clever enough to beatevery such potential tyrant by giving in to a certain extent to the plebeians.And finally153 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_153_r1.gif]3. there were patricians big-minded and far-seeing enough to insist upon theneed of reconciliation with the plebeians.Thus in 509 BC, Valerius Poplicola (3), the consul, enacted that whenever thelife or rights of any citizen were at stake, there should be an appeal from themagistrates to the general assembly. This Lex Valeria was “the Habeas Corpus ofRome,” and it freed the Roman plebeians from the worst dangers of classvindictiveness in the law courts.In 494 BC occurred a strike (1).After the Latin war the pressure of debt had become excessive, and the plebeianssaw with indignation their friends, who had often served the state bravely inthe legions, thrown into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand ofpatrician creditors. War was raging against the Volscians; but the legionaries,on their victorious return, refused any longer to obey the consuls, and marched,though without any disorder, to the Sacred Mount beyond the Anio (up the Tiber).There they prepared to found a new city, since the rights of citizens weredenied to them in the old one. The patricians were compelled to give way, andthe plebeians, returning to Rome from the “First Secession,” received theprivilege of having officers of their own, tribunes and ædiles.3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en105]In 486 BC arose Spurius Cassius (2), a consul who carried an Agrarian Lawsecuring public land for the plebeians. But the next year he was accused ofaiming at royal power, and condemned to death. His law never came intooperation.There followed a long struggle on the part of the plebeians to have the laws ofRome written down, so that they would no longer have to trust to patricianmemories. In 451-450 BC the law of the Twelve Tables was published, the basis ofall Roman law.But in order that the Twelve Tables should be formulated, a committee of ten(the decemvirate) was appointed in the place of the ordinary magistrates. Asecond decemvirate, appointed in succession to the first, attempted a sort ofaristocratic counterrevolution under Appius Claudius. The plebeians withdrewagain a second time to the Sacred Mount, and Appius Claudius committed suicidein prison.In 440 came a famine, and a second attempt to found a popular tyranny upon thepopular wrongs, by Spurius Mælius, a wealthy plebeian, which ended in hisassassination.After the sack of Rome by the Gauls (390 BC), Marcus Manlius, who had been incommand of the Capitol when the geese had saved it, came forward as a popularleader. The plebeians were suffering severely from the after-war usury andprofiteering of the patricians, and were incurring heavy debts in rebuilding andrestocking their farms. Manlius spent his fortune in releasing debtors. He wasaccused by the patricians of tyrannous intentions, condemned, and suffered thefate of condemned traitors in Rome, being flung from the Tarpeian Rock, theprecipitous edge of that same Capitoline Hill he had defended.In 376 BC, Licinius, who was one of the ten tribunes for the people, began along struggle with the patricians by making certain proposals called theLicinian Rogations, that there should be a limit to the amount of public landtaken by any single citizen, so leaving some for everybody, that outstandingdebts should be forgiven without interest upon the repayment of the principal,and that henceforth one at least of the two consuls should be a plebeian. Thisprecipitated a ten-year struggle. The plebeian power to stop business by theveto of their representatives, the tribunes, was fully exercised. In cases ofnational extremity it was the custom to set all other magistrates aside andappoint one leader, the Dictator. Rome had done such a thing during times ofmilitary necessity before, but now the patricians set up a Dictator in a time ofprofound peace, with the idea of crushing Licinius altogether. They appointedCamillus, who had besieged and taken Veii from the Etruscans. But Camillus was awiser man than his supporters; he brought about a compromise between the twoorders in which most of the demands of the plebeians were conceded (366 BC),dedicated a temple to Concord, and resigned his power.Thereafter the struggle between the orders abated. It abated because, amongother influences, the social differences between patricians and plebeians werediminishing. Trade was coming to Rome with increasing political power, and manyplebeians were growing rich and many patricians becoming relatively poor.Intermarriage had been rendered possible by a change in the law, and socialintermixture was going on. While the rich plebeians were becoming, if notaristocratic, at least oligarchic in habits and sympathy, new classes werespringing up in Rome with fresh interests and no political standing.Particularly abundant were the freedmen, slaves set free, for the most partartisans, but some of them traders, who were growing wealthy. And the Senate, nolonger a purely patrician body—since various official positions were now open toplebeians, and such plebeian officials became senators—was becoming now anassembly of all the wealthy, able, energetic, and influential men in the state.The Roman power was expanding, and as it expanded these old class oppositions ofthe early Latin community were becoming unmeaning. They were being replaced bynew associations and new antagonisms. Rich men of all origins were being drawntogether into a common interest against the communistic ideas of the poor.In 390 BC Rome was a miserable little city on the borders of Etruria, beingsacked by the Gauls; in 275 BC she was ruling and unifying all Italy, from theArno to the Straits of Messina. The compromise of Camillus (367 BC) had put anend to internal dissensions, and left her energies free for expansion. And thesame queer combination of sagacity and aggressive selfishness that haddistinguished the war of her orders at home and enabled her population to worryout a balance of power without any catastrophe, marks her policy abroad. Sheunderstood the value of allies; she could assimilate; abroad as at home shecould in those days at least “give and take” with a certain fairness and sanity.There lay the peculiar power of Rome. By that it was she succeeded where Athens,for example, had conspicuously failed.The Athenian democracy suffered much from that narrowness of “patriotism,” whichis the ruin of all nations. Athens was disliked and envied by her own empirebecause she dominated it in a spirit of civic egotism; her disasters were notfelt and shared as disasters by her subject-cities. The shrewder, nobler Romansenators of the great years of Rome, before the first Punic War overstrained hermoral strength and began her degeneration, were not only willing in the lastresort to share their privileges with the mass of their own people, but eager toincorporate their sturdiest antagonists upon terms of equality with themselves.They extended their citizenship cautiously but steadily. Some cities becameRoman, with even a voting share in the government. Others had self-governmentand the right to trade or marry in Rome, without full Roman citizenship.Garrisons of full citizens were set up at strategic points, and colonies withvariable privileges established amidst the purely conquered peoples. The need tokeep communications open in this great and growing mass of citizenship wasevident from the first. Printing and paper were not yet available forintercourse, but a system of high roads followed the Latin speech and the Romanrule. The first of these, the Appian Way, ran from Rome ultimately into the heelof Italy. It was begun by the censor Appius Claudius (who must not be confusedwith the decemvir Appius Claudius of a century earlier) in 312 BC.According to a census made in 265 BC, there were already in the Roman dominions,that is to say in Italy south of the Arno, three hundred thousand citizens. Theyall had a common interest in the welfare of the state; they were all touched alittle with the diffused kingship of the republic. This was, we have to note, anabsolutely new thing in the history of mankind. All considerable states andkingdoms and empires hitherto had been communities by mere obedience to somehead, some monarch, upon whose moods and character the public welfare washelplessly dependent. No republic had hitherto succeeded in being anything morethan a city state. The so-called Athenian “empire” was simply a city statedirecting its allies and its subjugated cities. In a few decades the Romanrepublic was destined to extend its citizenship into the valley of the Po, toassimilate the kindred Gauls, replacing their language by Latin, and to set up aLatin city, Aquileia, at the very head of the Adriatic Sea. In 89 BC all freeinhabitants of Italy became Roman citizens; in 212 AD the citizenship wasextended to all free men in the empire.This extraordinary political growth was manifestly the precursor of all modernstates of the western type. It is as interesting to the political student,therefore, as a carboniferous amphibian or an archœopteryx to the student ofzoological development. It is the primitive type of the now dominant order. Itsexperiences throw light upon all subsequent political history.One natural result of this growth of a democracy of hundreds of thousands ofcitizens scattered over the greater part of Italy was the growth in power of theSenate. There had been in the development of the Roman constitution a variety offorms of the popular assembly, the plebeian assembly, the assembly by tribes,the assembly by centuries, and the like, into which variety we cannot enter herewith any fullness; but the idea was established that with the popular assemblylay the power of initiating laws. It is to be noted that there was a sort ofparallel government in this system. The assembly by tribes or by centuries wasan assembly of the whole citizen body, patrician and plebeian together; theassembly of the plebeians was of course an assembly only of the plebeian class.Each assembly had its own officials; the former, the consuls, etc.; the latter,the tribunes. While Rome was a little state, twenty miles square, it waspossible to assemble something like a representative gathering of the people,but it will be manifest that with the means of communication existing in Italyat that time, it was now impossible for the great bulk of the citizens even tokeep themselves informed of what was going on at Rome, much less to take anyeffective part in political life there. Aristotle in his Politics had alreadypointed out the virtual disenfranchisement of voters who lived out of the cityand were preoccupied with agricultural pursuits, and this sort ofdisenfranchisement by mechanical difficulties applied to the vast majority ofRoman citizens. With the growth of Rome an unanticipated weakness crept intopolitical life through these causes, and the popular assembly became more andmore a gathering of political hacks and the city riffraff, and less and less arepresentation of the ordinary worthy citizens. The popular assembly camenearest to power and dignity in the fourth century BC. From that period itsteadily declined in influence, and the new Senate, which was no longer apatrician body, with a homogeneous and on the whole a noble tradition, but abody of rich men, ex-magistrates, powerful officials, bold adventurers and thelike, pervaded by a strong disposition to return to the idea of hereditaryqualification, became for three centuries the ruling power in the Roman world.There are two devices since known to the world which might have enabled thepopular government of Rome to go on developing beyond its climax in the days ofAppius Claudius the Censor, at the close of the fourth century BC, but neitherof them occurred to the Roman mind. The first of these devices was a proper useof print. In our account of early Alexandria we have already remarked upon thestrange fact that printed books did not come into the world in the fourth orthird century BC. This account of Roman affairs forces us to repeat that remark.To the modern mind it is clear that a widespread popular government demands, asa necessary condition for health, a steady supply of correct information uponpublic affairs to all the citizens and a maintenance of interest. The populargovernments in the modern states that have sprung up on either side of theAtlantic during the last two centuries have been possible only through the moreor less honest and thorough ventilation of public affairs through the press. Butin Italy the only way in which the government at Rome could communicate withanybody of its citizens elsewhere was by sending a herald, and with theindividual citizen it could hold no communication by any means at all.The second device, for which the English are chiefly responsible in the historyof mankind, which the Romans never used, was the almost equally obvious one ofrepresentative government. For the old Popular Assembly (in its threefold form)it would have been possible to have substituted a gathering of delegates. Lateron in history, the English did, as the state grew, realize this necessity.Certain men, the Knights of the Shire, were called up to Westminster to speakand vote for local feeling, and were more or less formally elected for that end.The Roman situation seems to a modern mind to have called aloud for such amodification. It was never made.The method of assembling the comitia tributa (one of the three main forms of thePopular Assembly) was by the proclamation of a herald, who was necessarilyinaudible to most of Italy, seventeen days before the date of the gathering. Theaugurs, the priests of divination whom Rome had inherited from the Etruscans,examined the entrails of sacrificial beasts on the night before the actualassembly, and if they thought fit to say that these gory portents wereunfavourable, the comitia tributa dispersed. But if the augurs reported that thelivers were propitious, there was a great blowing of horns from the Capitol andfrom the walls of the city, and the assembly went on. It was held in the openair, either in the little Forum beneath the Capitol or in a still smaller recessopening out of the Forum, or in the military exercising ground, the CampusMartius, now the most crowded part of modern Rome, but then an open space.Business began at dawn with prayer. There were no seats, and this probablyhelped to reconcile the citizen to the rule that everything ended at sunset.After the opening prayer came a discussion of the measures to be considered bythe assembly, and the proposals before the meeting were read out. Is it notastonishing that there were no printed copies distributed? If any copies werehanded about, they must have been in manuscript, and each copy must have beenliable to errors and deliberate falsification. No questions seem to have beenallowed, but private individuals might address the gathering with the permissionof the presiding magistrate.The multitude then proceeded to go into enclosures like cattle-pens according totheir tribes, and each tribe voted upon the measure under consideration. Thedecision was then taken not by the majority of the citizens, but by the majorityof tribes, and it was announced by the heralds.The Popular Assembly by centuries, comitia centuriata, was very similar in itscharacter, except that instead of thirty-five tribes there were, in the thirdcentury BC, 373 centuries, and there was a sacrifice as well as prayer to beginwith. The centuries, originally military (like the “hundreds” of primitiveEnglish local government), had long since lost any connection with the numberone hundred. Some contained only a few people; some very many. There wereeighteen centuries of knights (equites), who were originally men in a positionto maintain a horse and serve in the cavalry, though later the Roman knighthood,like knighthood in England, became a vulgar distinction of no military, mental,or moral significance. (These equites became a very important class as Rometraded and grew rich; for a time they were the real moving class in thecommunity. There was as little chivalry left among them at last as there is inthe “honours list” knights of England of today. The senators from about 200 BCwere excluded from trade. The equites became, therefore, the great business men,negotiatores, and as publicani they farmed the taxes). There were, in addition,eighty (!) centuries of wealthy men (worth over one hundred thousand asses),twenty-two of men worth over seventy five thoudsand asses, and so on. There weretwo centuries each of mechanics and musicians, and the proletarii made up onecentury. The decision in the comitia centuriata was by the majority ofcenturies.Is it any wonder that with the growth of the Roman state and the complication ofits business, power shifted back from such a Popular Assembly to the Senate,which was a comparatively compact body varying between three hundred as aminimum, and, at the utmost, nine hundred members (to which it was raised byCæsar), men who had to do with affairs and big business, who knew each othermore or less, and had a tradition of government and policy? The power ofnominating and calling up the senators vested in the Republic first with theconsuls, and when, some time after, “censors” were created, and many of thepowers of the consuls had been transferred to them, they were also given thispower. Appius Claudius, one of the first of the censors to exercise it, enrolledfreedmen in the tribes and called sons of freedmen to the Senate. But this was ashocking arrangement to the conservative instincts of the time; the consulswould not recognize his Senate, and the next censors (304 BC) set aside hisinvitations. His attempt, however, serves to show how far the Senate hadprogressed from its original condition as a purely patrician body. Like thecontemporary British House of Lords, it had become a gathering of big businessmen, energetic politicians, successful adventurers, great landowners, and thelike; its patrician dignity was a picturesque sham; but, unlike the BritishHouse of Lords, it was unchecked legally by anything but the inefficient PopularAssembly we have already described, and by the tribunes elected by the plebeianassembly. Its legal control over the consuls and proconsuls was not great; ithad little executive power; but in its prestige and experience lay its strengthand influence. The interests of its members were naturally antagonistic to theinterests of the general body of citizens, but for some generations that greatmass of ordinary men was impotent to express its dissent from the proceedings ofthis oligarchy. Direct popular government of a state larger than a city statehad already failed therefore in Italy, because as yet there was no publiceducation, no press, and no representative system; it, had failed through thesemere mechanical difficulties, before the first Punic War. But its appearance isof enormous interest, as the first appearance of a set of problems with whichthe whole political intelligence of the world wrestles at the present time.The Senate met usually in a Senate House in the Forum, but on special occasionsit would be called to meet in this or that temple; and when it had to deal withforeign ambassadors or its own generals (who were not allowed to enter the citywhile in command of troops), it assembled in the Campus Martius outside thewalls.§ 3It has been necessary to deal rather fully with the political structure of theRoman republic because of its immense importance to this day. The constitutionof Carthage need not detain us long.Italy under Rome was a republican country; Carthage was that much older thing, arepublican city. She had an “empire,” as Athens had an “empire,” of tributarystates which did not love her, and she had a great and naturally disloyalindustrial slave population.In the city there were two elected “kings,” as Aristotle calls them, thesuffetes , who were really equivalent to the Roman censors; their Semitic namewas the same as that used for the Jewish judges. There was an impotent publicassembly and a senate of leading personages; but two committees of this senate,nominally elected, but elected by easily controlled methods, the Hundred andFour and the Thirty, really constituted a close oligarchy of the richest andmost influential men. They told as little as they could to their allies andfellow citizens, and consulted them as little as possible. They pursued schemesin which the welfare of Carthage was no doubt subordinated to the advantage oftheir own group. They were hostile to new men or novel measures, and confidentthat a sea ascendancy that had lasted two centuries must be in the very natureof things.154 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_154_r1.gif]§ 4It would be interesting, and not altogether idle, to speculate what might havehappened to mankind if Rome and Carthage could have settled their differencesand made a permanent alliance in the Western world. If Alexander the Great hadlived, he might have come westward and driven these two powers into such afusion of interests. But that would not have suited the private schemes andsplendours of the Carthaginian oligarchy, and the new Senate of greater Rome wasnow growing fond of the taste of plunder and casting covetous eyes across theStraits of Messina upon the Carthaginian possessions in Sicily. They werecovetous, but they were afraid of the Carthaginian sea-power. Roman popular“patriotism,” however, was also jealous and fearful of these Carthaginians, andless inclined to count the cost of a conflict. The alliance Pyrrhus had forcedupon Rome and Carthage held good for eleven years, but Rome was ripe for what iscalled in modern political jargon an “offensive defensive” war. The occasionarose in 264 BC.At that time Sicily was not completely in Carthaginian hands. The eastward endwas still under the power of the Greek king of Syracuse, Hiero, a successor ofthat Dionysius to whom Plato had gone as resident court philosopher. A band ofmercenaries who had been in the service of Syracuse seized upon Messina (289BC), and raided the trade of Syracuse so that at last Hiero was forced to takemeasures to suppress them (270 BC). Thereupon Carthage, which was also vitallyconcerned in the suppression of piracy, came to his aid, and put in aCarthaginian garrison at Messina. This was an altogether justifiable proceeding.Now that Tyre had been destroyed, the only capable guardian of sea law in theMediterranean was Carthage, and the suppression of piracy was her task by habitand tradition.The pirates of Messina appealed to Rome, and the accumulating jealousy and fearof Carthage decided the Roman people to help them. An expedition was dispatchedto Messina under the consul Appius Claudius (the third Appius Claudius we havehad to mention in this history).So began the first of the most wasteful and disastrous series of wars that hasever darkened the history of mankind. But this is how one historian, soaked withthe fantastic political ideas of our times, is pleased to write of this evilexpedition. “The Romans knew they were entering on war with Carthage; but thepolitical instincts of the people were right, for a Carthaginian garrison on theSicilian Straits would have been a dangerous menace to the peace of Italy.” Sothey protected the peace of Italy from this “menace” by a war that lasted nearlya quarter of a century. They wrecked their own slowly acquired political moralin the process.The Romans captured Messina, and Hiero deserted from the Carthaginians to theRomans. Then for sometime the struggle centred upon the town Agrigentum. Thisthe Romans besieged, and a period of trench warfare ensued. Both sides sufferedgreatly from plague and irregular supplies; the Romans lost thirty thousand men;but in the end (261 BC) the Carthaginians evacuated the place and retired totheir fortified towns on the western coast of the island of which Lilybæum wasthe chief. These they could supply easily from the African mainland, and, aslong as their sea ascendancy held, they could exhaust any Roman effort againstthem.And now a new and very extraordinary phase of the war began. The Romans came outupon the sea, and to the astonishment of the Carthaginians and themselvesdefeated the Carthaginian fleet. Since the days of Salamis there had been aconsiderable development of naval architecture. Then the ruling type ofbattleship was a trireme, a galley with three banks (rows) of oars; now theleading Carthaginian battleship was a quinquereme, a much bigger galley withfive banks of oars, which could ram or shear the oars of any feebler vessel. TheRomans had come into the war with no such shipping. Now they set to work tobuild quinqueremes, being helped, it is said, in their designing by one of theseCarthaginian vessels coming ashore. In two months they built a hundredquinqueremes and thirty triremes. But they had no skilled navigators, noexperienced oarsmen, and these deficiencies they remedied partly with theassistance of their Greek allies and partly by the invention of new tactics.Instead of relying upon ramming or breaking the oars of the adversary, whichdemanded more seamanship than they possessed, they decided to board the enemy,and they constructed a sort of long drawbridge on their ships, held up to a mastby a pulley and with grappling-hooks and spikes at the end. They also loadedtheir galleys with soldiers. Then as the Carthaginian rammed or swept alongside,this corvus, as it was called, could be let down and the boarders could swarmaboard him.Simple as this device was, it proved a complete success. It changed the courseof the war and the fate of the world. The small amount of invention needed tocounteract the corvus was not apparently within the compass of the Carthaginianrulers. At the battle of Mylæ (260 BC) the Romans gained their first navalvictory and captured or destroyed fifty vessels. At the great battle of Ecnomus(256 BC), “probably the greatest naval engagement of antiquity,”4[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en106] in which seven or eight hundred bigships were engaged, the Carthaginians showed that they had learnt nothing fromtheir former disaster. According to rule they outmanœuvred and defeated theRomans, but the corvus again defeated them. The Romans sank thirty vessels andcaptured sixty-four.Thereafter the war continued with violent fluctuations of fortune, but with acontinuous demonstration of the greater energy, solidarity, and initiative ofthe Romans. After Ecnomus the Romans invaded Africa by sea, and sent aninsufficiently supported army, which after many successes and the capture ofTunis (within ten miles of Carthage) was completely defeated. They lost theirsea ascendancy through a storm, and regained it by building a second fleet oftwo hundred and twenty ships within three months. They captured Palermo, anddefeated a great Carthaginian army there (251 BC), capturing one hundred andfour elephants, and making such a triumphal procession into Rome as that cityhad never seen before. They made an unsuccessful siege of Lilybæum, the chiefsurviving Carthaginian stronghold in Sicily. They lost their second fleet in agreat naval battle at Drepanum (249 BC), losing one hundred and eighty out oftwo hundred and ten vessels; and a third fleet of one hundred and twentybattleships and eight hundred transports was lost in the same year partly inbattle and partly in a storm.For seven years a sort of war went on between the nearly exhausted combatants, awar of raids and feeble sieges, during which the Carthaginians had the best ofit at sea. Then by a last supreme effort Rome launched a fourth fleet of twohundred keels, and defeated the last strength of the Carthaginians at the battleof the Ægatian Isles (241 BC), after which Carthage (240 BC) sued for peace.By the terms of this peace, all Sicily, except for the dominions of Hiero ofSyracuse, became an “estate” of the Roman people. There was no such process ofassimilation as had been practised in Italy; Sicily became a conquered province,paying tribute and yielding profit like the provinces of the older empires. And,in addition, Carthage paid a war indemnity of 3,200 talents (= £788,000).§ 5For twenty-two years there was peace between Rome and Carthage. It was peacewithout prosperity. Both combatants were suffering from the want anddisorganization that follow naturally and necessarily upon all great wars. Theterritories of Carthage seethed with violent disorder; the returning soldierscould not get their pay, and mutinied and looted; the land went uncultivated. Weread of horrible cruelties in the suppression of these troubles by Hamilcar, theCarthaginian general; of men being crucified by the thousand. Sardinia andCorsica revolted. The “peace of Italy” was scarcely happier. The Gauls rose andmarched south; they were defeated, and forty thousand of them killed at Telamon.It is manifest that Italy was incomplete until it reached the Alps. Romancolonies were planted in the valley of the Po, and the great northward artery,the Via Flaminia, was begun. But it shows the moral and intellectual degradationof this postwar period that when the Gauls were threatening Rome, humansacrifices were proposed and carried out. The old Carthaginian sea law wasbroken up—it may have been selfish and monopolistic, but it was at leastorderly—the Adriatic swarmed with Illyrian pirates, and as the result of aquarrel arising out of this state of affairs, Illyria, after two wars, had to beannexed as a second “province.” By sending expeditions to annex Sardinia andCorsica, which were Carthaginian provinces in revolt, the Romans prepared theway for the Second Punic War.155 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_155_r1.gif]The First Punic War had tested and demonstrated the relative strength of Romeand Carthage. With a little more wisdom on either side, with a little moremagnanimity on the part of Rome, there need never have been a renewal of thestruggle. But Rome was an ungracious conqueror. She seized Corsica and Sardiniaon no just grounds, she increased the indemnity by 1,200 talents, she set alimit, the Ebro, to Carthaginian developments in Spain. There was a strong partyin Carthage, led by Hanno, for the propitiation of Rome; but it was natural thatmany Carthaginians should come to regard their national adversary with adespairing hatred.Hatred is one of the passions that can master a life, and there is a type oftemperament very prone to it, ready to see life in terms of vindictivemelodrama, ready to find stimulus and satisfaction in frightful demonstrationsof “justice” and revenge. The fears and jealousies of the squatting-place andthe cave still bear their dark blossoms in our lives; we are not four hundredgenerations yet from the old Stone Age. Great wars, as all Europe knows, givethis “hating” temperament the utmost scope, and the greed and pride and crueltythat the First Punic War had released were now producing a rich crop ofanti-foreign monomania. The outstanding figure upon the side of Carthage was agreat general and administrator, Hamilcar Barca, who now set himself tocircumvent and shatter Rome. He was the father-in-law of Hasdrubal and thefather of a boy Hannibal, destined to be the most dreaded enemy that ever scaredthe Roman Senate. The most obvious course before Carthage was the reconstructionof its fleet and naval administration, and the recovery of sea power, but this,it would seem, Hamilcar could not effect. As an alternative he resolved toorganize Spain as the base of a land attack upon Italy. He went to Spain asgovernor in 236 BC, and Hannibal related afterwards that his father then—he wasa boy of eleven—made him vow deathless hostility to the Roman power.This quasi-insane concentration of the gifts and lives of the Barca family uponrevenge is but one instance of the narrowing and embitterment of life that thestresses and universal sense of insecurity of this great struggle produced inthe minds of men. A quarter of a century of war had left the whole western worldmiserable and harsh. While the eleven-year-old Hannibal was taking his vow ofundying hatred, there was running about a farmhouse of Tusculum a small butprobably very disagreeable child of two named Marcus Porcius Cato. This boylived to be eighty-five years old, and his ruling passion seems to have beenhatred for any human happiness but his own. He was a good soldier, and had asuccessful political career. He held a command in Spain, and distinguishedhimself by his cruelties. He posed as a champion of religion and publicmorality, and under this convenient cloak carried on a lifelong war againsteverything that was young, gracious, or pleasant. Whoever roused his jealousyincurred his moral disapproval. He was energetic in the support andadministration of all laws against dress, against the personal adornment ofwomen, against entertainments and free discussion. He was so fortunate as to bemade censor, which gave him great power over the private lives of public people.He was thus able to ruin public opponents through private scandals. He expelledManlius from the Senate for giving his wife a kiss in the daytime in the sightof their daughter. He persecuted Greek literature, about which, until late inlife, he was totally ignorant. Then he read and admired Demosthenes. He wrote inLatin upon agriculture and the ancient and lost virtues of Rome. From thesewritings much light is thrown upon his qualities. One of his maxims was thatwhen a slave was not sleeping he should be working. Another was that old oxenand slaves should be sold off. He left the war horse that had carried himthrough his Spanish campaigns behind him when he returned to Italy in order tosave freight. He hated other people’s gardens, and cut off the supply of waterfor garden use in Rome. After entertaining company, when dinner was over hewould go out to correct any negligence in the service with a leather thong. Headmired his own virtues very greatly, and insisted upon them in his writings.There was a battle at Thermopylæ against Antiochus the Great, of which he wrote,“those who saw him charging the enemy, routing and pursuing them, declared thatCato owed less to the people of Rome, than the people of Rome owed to Cato.”5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en107] In his old age Cato became lasciviousand misconducted himself with a woman slave. Finally, when his son protestedagainst this disorder of their joint household, he married a young wife, thedaughter of his secretary, who was not in a position to refuse his offer. (Whatbecame of the woman slave is not told. Probably he sold her). This compendium ofall the old Roman virtues died at an advanced age, respected and feared. Almosthis last public act was to urge on the Third Punic War and the final destructionof Carthage. He had gone to Carthage as a commissioner to settle certaindifferences between Carthage and Numidia, and he had been shocked and horrifiedto find some evidences of prosperity and even of happiness in that country.From the time of that visit onward Cato concluded every speech he made in theSenate by croaking out “Delenda est Carthago” (“Carthage must be destroyed”).Such was the type of man that rose to prominence in Rome during the Punicstruggle, such was the protagonist of Hannibal and the Carthaginian revanche,and by him and by Hannibal we may judge the tone and quality of the age.The two great western powers, and Rome perhaps more than Carthage, were strainedmentally and morally by the stresses of the First War. The evil side of life wasuppermost. The history of the Second and Third Punic Wars (219 to 201 and 149 to146 BC), it is plain, is not the history of perfectly sane peoples. It isnonsense for historians to write of the “political instincts” of the Romans orCarthaginians. Quite other instincts were loose. The red eyes of the ancestralape had come back into the world. It was a time when reasonable men were howleddown or murdered; the true spirit of the age is shown in the eager examinationfor signs and portents of the still quivering livers of those human victims whowere sacrificed in Rome during the panic before the battle of Telamon. Thewestern world was indeed black with homicidal monomania. Two great peoples, bothvery necessary to the world’s development, fell foul of one another, and at lastRome succeeded in murdering Carthage.§ 6We can only tell very briefly here of the particulars of the Second and ThirdPunic Wars. We have told how Hamilcar began to organize Spain, and how theRomans forbade him to cross the Ebro. He died in 228 BC, and was followed by hisson-in-law Hasdrubal, who was assassinated in 221 BC and succeeded by Hannibal,who was now twenty-six. The actual war was precipitated by the Romans making abreach of their own regulations, and interfering with affairs south of the Ebro.Whereupon Hannibal marched straight through the south of Gaul, and crossed theAlps (218 BC) into Italy.The history of the next fifteen years is the story of the most brilliant andfutile raid in history. For fifteen years Hannibal held out in Italy, victoriousand unconquered. The Roman generals were no match for the Carthaginian, andwhenever they met him they were beaten. But one Roman general, P. CorneliusScipio, had the strategic sense to take a course that robbed all Hannibal’svictories of fruit. At the outbreak of the war he had been sent by sea toMarseilles to intercept Hannibal; he arrived three days late, and, instead ofpursuing him, he sent on his army into Spain to cut up Hannibal’s supplies andreinforcements. Throughout all the subsequent war there remained this Roman armyof Spain between Hannibal and his base. He was left “in the air,” incapable ofconducting sieges or establishing conquests.Whenever he met the Romans in open fight he beat them. He gained two greatvictories in North Italy, and won over the Gauls to his side. He pressed southinto Etruria, and ambushed, surrounded, and completely destroyed a Roman army atLake Trasimene. In 216 BC he was assailed by a vastly superior Roman force underVarro at Cannæ, and destroyed it utterly. Fifty thousand men are said to havebeen killed and ten thousand prisoners taken. He was, however, unable to push onand capture Rome because he had no siege equipment.But Cannæ produced other fruits. A large part of Southern Italy came over toHannibal, including Capua, the city next in size to Rome, and the Macedonian’sallied themselves with him. Moreover, Hiero of Syracuse, the faithful ally ofRome, was now dead, and his successor Hieronymus turned over to theCarthaginians. The Romans carried on the war, however, with great toughness andresolution; they refused to treat with Hannibal after Cannæ, they pressed a slowbut finally successful blockade and siege of Capua, and a Roman army set itselfto reduce Syracuse. The siege of Syracuse is chiefly memorable for the brilliantinventions of the philosopher Archimedes, which long held the Romans at bay. Wehave already named this Archimedes as one of the pupils and correspondents ofthe school of the Alexandrian Museum. He was killed in the final storm of thetown. Tarentum (209 BC), Hannibal’s chief port and means of supply fromCarthage, at last followed Syracuse (212 BC) and Capua (211 BC), and hiscommunications became irregular.Spain also was wrested bit by bit from the Carthaginian grip. When at lastreinforcements for Hannibal under his brother Hasdrubal (not to be confused withhis brother-in-law of the same name who was assassinated) struggled through intoItaly, they were destroyed at the battle of the Metaurus (207 BC), and the firstnews that came to Hannibal of the disaster was the hacked-off head of hisbrother thrown into his camp.Thereafter Hannibal was blockaded into Calabria, the heel of Italy. He had noforces for further operations of any magnitude, and he returned at last toCarthage in time to command the Carthaginians in the last battle of the war.This last battle, the battle of Zama (202 BC), was fought close to Carthage.It was the first defeat Hannibal experienced and so it is well to give a littleattention to the personality of his conqueror, Scipio Africanus the Elder, whostands out in history as a very fine gentleman indeed, a great soldier and agenerous man. We have already mentioned a certain P. Cornelius Scipio who struckat Hannibal’s base in Spain; this was his son; until after Zama this son borethe same name of P. Cornelius Scipio, and then the surname of Africanus wasgiven him. (The younger Scipio Africanus, Scipio Africanus Minor, who was laterto end the Third Punic War, was the adopted son of the son of this first ScipioAfricanus the Elder). Scipio Africanus was everything that aroused the distrust,hatred, and opposition of old-fashioned Romans of the school of Cato. He wasyoung, he was happy and able, he spent money freely, he was well versed in Greekliterature, and inclined rather to Phrygian novelties in religion than to thesterner divinities of Rome. And he did not believe in the extreme discretionthat then ruled Roman strategy.After the early defeats of the Second Punic War, Roman military operations weredominated by the personality of a general, Fabius, who raised the necessity ofavoiding battle with Hannibal into a kind of sacred principle. For ten years“Fabian tactics” prevailed in Italy. The Romans blockaded, cut up convoys,attacked stragglers, and ran away whenever Hannibal appeared. No doubt it waswise for a time after their first defeats to do this sort of thing, but thebusiness of the stronger power, and Rome was the stronger power throughout theSecond Punic War, is not to tolerate an interminable war, but to repair losses,discover able generals, train better armies, and destroy the enemy power.Decision is one of the duties of strength.To such men as young Scipio, the sly, ineffective artfulness of Fabianism, whichwas causing both Italy and Carthage to bleed slowly to death, was detestable. Heclamoured for an attack upon Carthage itself.But Fabius, on this occasion, filled the city with alarms, as if thecommonwealth was going to be brought into the most extreme danger by a rash andindiscreet young man; in short, he scrupled not to do or say anything he thoughtlikely to dissuade his countrymen from embracing the proposal. With the Senatehe carried his point. But the people believed that his opposition to Scipioproceeded either from envy of his success, or from a secret fear that if thisyoung hero should perform some signal exploit, put an end to the war, or evenremove it out of Italy, his own slow proceedings through the course of so manyyears might be imputed to indolence or timidity. . . . He applied to Crassus,the colleague of Scipio, and endeavoured to persuade him not to yield thatprovince to Scipio, but, if he thought it proper to conduct the war in thatmanner, to go himself against Carthage. Nay, he even hindered the raising ofmoney for that expedition, so that Scipio was obliged to find the supplies as hecould. . . . He endeavoured to prevent the young men who offered to go asvolunteers from giving in their names, and loudly declared, both in the Senateand Forum, “That Scipio did not only himself avoid Hannibal, but intended tocarry away with him the remaining strength of Italy, persuading the young men toabandon their parents, their wives, and native city, while an unsubdued andpotent enemy was still at their doors.” With these assertions he so terrifiedthe people, that they allowed Scipio to take with him only the legions that werein Sicily, and three hundred of those men who had served him with so muchfidelity in Spain. . . . After Scipio was gone over into Africa, an account wassoon brought to Rome of his glorious and wonderful achievements. This accountwas followed by rich spoils, which confirmed it. A Numidian king was takenprisoner; two camps were burned and destroyed; and in them a vast number of men,arms, and horses; and the Carthaginians sent orders to Hannibal to quit hisfruitless hopes in Italy, and return home to defend his own country. Whilstevery tongue was applauding these exploits of Scipio, Fabius proposed that hissuccessor should be appointed, without any shadow of reason for it, except whatthis well-known maxim implies: viz., “That it is dangerous to trust affairs ofsuch importance to the fortune of one man, because it is not likely that he willbe always successful. . . .” Nay, even when Hannibal embarked his army andquitted Italy, Fabius ceased not to disturb the general joy and to damp thespirits of Rome, for he took the liberty to affirm, “That the commonwealth wasnow come to her last and worst trial; that she had the most reason to dread theefforts of Hannibal when he should arrive in Africa, and attack her sons underthe walls of Carthage; that Scipio would have to do with an army yet warm withthe blood of so many Roman generals, dictators, and consuls.” The city wasalarmed with these declamations, and though the war was removed into Africa, thedanger seemed to approach nearer Rome than ever.Before the battle of Zama there were a brief truce and negotiations, which brokedown through the fault of the Carthaginians. As with the battle of Arbela, sothe exact day of the battle of Zama can be fixed by an eclipse, which in thiscase occurred during the fighting. The Romans had been joined by the Numidians,the hinterland people of Carthage, under their king Massinissa, and this gavethem—for the first time in any battle against Hannibal—a great superiority ofcavalry. Hannibal’s cavalry wings were driven off, while at the same time thesounder discipline of Scipio’s infantry enabled them to open lanes for thecharge of the Carthaginian war elephants without being thrown into confusion.Hannibal attempted to extend his infantry line to envelop the Roman infantrymass, but while at Cannæ all the advantage of training and therefore ofmanœuvring power had been on his side, and he had been able to surround andmassacre a crowd of infantry, he now found against him an infantry line betterthan his own. His own line broke as it extended, the Roman legion charged home,and the day was lost. The Roman cavalry came back from the pursuit of Hannibal’shorse to turn what was already a defeat into a disastrous rout.Carthage submitted without any further struggle. The terms were severe, but theyleft it possible for her to hope for an honourable future. She had to abandonSpain to Rome, to give up all her war fleet except ten vessels, to pay tenthousand talents (£2,400,000), and, what was the most difficult condition ofall, to agree not to wage war without the permission of Rome. Finally acondition was added that Hannibal, as the great enemy of Rome, should besurrendered. But he saved his countrymen from this humiliation by flying toAsia.These were exorbitant conditions, with which Rome should have been content. Butthere are nations so cowardly that they dare not merely conquer their enemies;they must mak siccar and destroy them. The generation of Romans that sawgreatness and virtue in a man like Cato the Censor, necessarily made theircountry a mean ally and a cowardly victor.§ 7The history of Rome for the fifty-six years that elapsed between the battle ofZama and the last act of the tragedy, the Third Punic War, tells of a hardungracious expansion of power abroad and of a slow destruction, by the usury andgreed of the rich, of the free agricultural population at home.The spirit of the nation had become harsh and base; there was no furtherextension of citizenship, no more generous attempts at the assimilation ofcongenial foreign populations. Spain was administered badly and settled slowlyand with great difficulty. Complicated interventions led to the reduction ofIllyria and Macedonia to the position of tribute-paying provinces; Rome, it wasevident, was going to “tax the foreigner” now and release her home populationfrom taxation. After 168 BC the old land tax was no longer levied in Italy, andthe only revenue derived from Italy was from the state domains and through a taxon imports from overseas. The revenues from the province of “Asia” defrayed theexpenses of the Roman state. At home men of the Cato type were acquiring farmsby loans and foreclosure, often the farms of men impoverished by war service;they were driving the free citizens off their land, and running their farms withthe pitilessly driven slave labour that was made cheap and abundant. Such menregarded alien populations abroad merely as unimported slaves. Sicily was handedover to the greedy enterprise of tax-farmers. Corn could be grown there by richmen using slaves, and imported very profitably into Rome, and so the home landcould be turned over to cattle and sheep feeding. Consequently a drift of theuprooted Italian population to the towns, and particularly to Rome, began.156 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_156_r1.gif]Of the first conflicts of the spreading power of Rome with the Seleucids, andhow she formed an alliance with Egypt, we can tell little here, nor of thetortuous fluctuations of the Greek cities under the shadow of her advance untilthey fell into actual subjugation. A map must suffice to show the extension ofher empire at this time.The general grim baseness of the age was not without its protesting voices. Wehave already told how the wasting disease of the Second Punic War, a disease ofthe state which was producing avaricious rich men exactly as diseases of thebody will sometimes produce great pustules, was ended by the vigour of ScipioAfricanus. When it had seemed doubtful whether the Senate would let him go asthe Roman general, he had threatened an appeal to the people. Thereafter he wasa marked man for the senatorial gang, who were steadily changing Italy from aland of free cultivators to a land of slave-worked cattle ranches; theyattempted to ruin him before ever he reached Africa; they gave him forcesinsufficient, as they hoped, for victory; and after the war they barred himstrictly from office. Interest and his natural malice alike prompted Cato toattack him.Scipio Africanus the Elder seems to have been of a generous and impatienttemperament, and indisposed to exploit the popular discontent with currenttendencies and his own very great popularity to his own advantage. He went assubordinate to his brother Lucius Scipio, when the latter commanded the firstRoman army to pass into Asia. At Magnesia in Lydia a great composite army underAntiochus III, the Seleucid monarch, suffered the fate (190 BC) of the verysimilar Persian armies of a hundred and forty years before. This victory drewdown upon Lucius Scipio the hostility of the Senate, and he was accused ofmisappropriating moneys received from Antiochus. This filled Africanus withhonest rage. As Lucius stood up in the Senate with his accounts in his handsready for the badgering of his accusers, Africanus snatched the documents fromhim, tore them up, and flung the fragments down. His brother, he said, had paidinto the treasury 200,000 sestertia (= £2,000,000). Was he now to be pesteredand tripped up upon this or that item? When, later on, Lucius was prosecuted andcondemned, Africanus rescued him by force. Being impeached, he reminded thepeople that the day was the anniversary of the battle of Zama, and defied theauthorities amidst the plaudits of the crowd.The Roman people seem to have liked and supported Scipio Africanus, and, afteran interval of two thousand years, men must like him still. He was able to throwtorn paper in the face of the Senate, and when Lucius was attacked again, one ofthe tribunes of the people interposed his veto and quashed the proceedings. ButScipio Africanus lacked that harder alloy which makes men great democraticleaders. He was no Cæsar. He had none of the qualities that subdue a man to thebase necessities of political life. After these events he retired in disgustfrom Rome to his estates, and there he died in the year 183 BC.In the same year died Hannibal. He poisoned himself in despair. The steadfastfear of the Roman Senate had hunted him from court to court. In spite of theindignant protests of Scipio, Rome in the peace negotiations had demanded hissurrender from Carthage, and she continued to make this demand of every powerthat sheltered him. When peace was made with Antiochus III, this was one of theconditions. He was run to earth at last in Bithynia; the king of Bithyniadetained him in order to send him to Rome, but he had long carried the poison heneeded in a ring, and by this he died.It adds to the honour of the name of Scipio that it was another Scipio, ScipioNasica, who parodied Cato’s Delenda est Carthago by ending all his speeches inthe Senate with “Carthage must stand.” He had the wisdom to see that theexistence and stimulus of Carthage contributed to the general prosperity ofRome.Yet it was the second Scipio Africanus, grandson by adoption of Scipio Africanusthe Elder, who took and destroyed Carthage. The sole offence of theCarthaginians, which brought about the third and last Punic War, was that theycontinued to trade and prosper. Their trade was not a trade that competed withthat of Rome; when Carthage was destroyed, much of her trade died with her, andNorth Africa entered upon a phase of economic retrogression; but her prosperityaroused that passion of envy which was evidently more powerful even than avaricein the “old Roman” type. The rich Equestrian order resented any wealth in theworld but its own. Rome provoked the war by encouraging the Numidians toencroach upon Carthage until the Carthaginians were goaded to fight in despair.Rome then pounced upon Carthage, and declared she had broken the treaty! She hadmade war without permission.The Carthaginians sent the hostages Rome demanded, they surrendered their arms,they prepared to surrender territory. But submission only increased thearrogance of Rome and the pitiless greed of the rich Equestrian order whichswayed her counsels. She now demanded that Carthage should be abandoned, and thepopulation removed to a spot at least ten miles from the sea. This demand theymade to a population that subsisted almost entirely by overseas trade!This preposterous order roused the Carthaginians to despair. They recalled theirexiles and prepared for resistance. The military efficiency of the Romans hadbeen steadily declining through a half-century of narrow-minded andbase-spirited government, and the first attacks upon the town in 149 BC almostended in disaster. Young Scipio, during these operations, distinguished himselfin a minor capacity. The next year was also a year of failure for theincompetents of the Senate. That august body then passed from a bullying mood toone of extreme panic. The Roman populace was even more seriously scared. YoungScipio, chiefly on account of his name, although he was under the proper age,and in other respects not qualified for the office, was made consul, and bundledoff to Africa to save his precious country.There followed the most obstinate and dreadful of sieges. Scipio built a moleacross the harbour, and cut off all supplies by land or sea. The Carthaginianssuffered horribly from famine; but they held out until the town was stormed. Thestreet fighting lasted for six days, and when at last the citadel capitulated,there were fifty thousand Carthaginians left alive out of an estimatedpopulation of half a million. These survivors went into slavery, the whole citywas burnt, the ruins were ploughed to express final destruction, and a curse wasinvoked with great solemnities upon anyone who might attempt to rebuild it.In the same year (146 BC) the Roman Senate and Equestrians also murdered anothergreat city that seemed to limit their trade monopolies, Corinth. They had ajustification, for Corinth had been in arms against them, but it was aninadequate justification.§ 8We must note here, in a brief section, a change in the military system of Rome,after the Second Punic War, that was of enormous importance in her laterdevelopment. Up to that period the Roman armies had been levies of freecitizens. Fighting power and voting power were closely connected; the publicassembly by centuries followed the paraphernalia of a military mobilization, andmarched, headed by the Equestrian centuries, to the Campus Martius. The systemwas very like that of the Boers before the last war in South Africa. Theordinary Roman citizen, like the ordinary Boer, was a farmer; at the summons ofhis country he went “on commando.” The Boers were, indeed, in many respects, thelast survivors of Aryanism. They fought extraordinarily well, but at the back oftheir minds was an anxious desire to go back to their farms. For prolongedoperations, such as the siege of Veii, the Romans reinforced and relieved theirtroops in relays; the Boers did much the same at the siege of Ladysmith.The necessity for subjugating Spain after the Second Punic War involved a needfor armies of a different type. Spain was too far off for periodic reliefs, andthe war demanded a more thorough training than was possible with these on andoff soldiers. Accordingly men were enlisted for longer terms and paid. So thepaid soldier first appeared in Roman affairs. And to pay was added booty. Catodistributed silver treasure among his command in Spain; and it is also on recordthat he attacked Scipio Africanus for distributing booty among his troops inSicily. The introduction of military pay led on to a professional army, andthis, a century later, to the disarmament of the ordinary Roman citizen, who wasnow drifting in an impoverished state into Rome and the larger towns. The greatwars had been won, the foundations of the empire had been well and truly laid bythe embattled farmers of Rome before 200 BC. In the process the embattledfarmers of Rome had already largely disappeared. The change that began after theSecond Punic War was completed towards the close of the century in thereorganization of the army by Marius, as we will tell in its place. After histime we shall begin to write of “the army” and then of “the legions” and weshall find we are dealing with a new kind of army altogether, no longer heldtogether in the solidarity of a common citizenship. As that tie fails, thelegions discover another in esprit de corps, in their common difference from andtheir common interest against the general community. They begin to develop awarmer interest in their personal leaders, who secure them pay and plunder.Before the Punic Wars it was the tendency of ambitious men in Rome to court theplebeians; after that time they began to court the legions.§ 9The history of the Roman Republic thus far, is in many respects much more modernin flavour, especially to the American or Western European reader, than anythingthat has preceded it. For the first time we have something like a self-governing“nation,” something larger than a mere city state, seeking to control its owndestinies. For the first time we have a wide countryside under one conception oflaw. We get in the Senate and the popular assembly a conflict of groups andpersonalities, an argumentative process of control, far more stable and enduringthan any autocracy can be, and far more flexible and adaptable than anypriesthood. For the first time also we encounter social conflicts comparable toour own. Money has superseded barter, and financial capital has become fluid andfree; not perhaps so fluid and free as it is today, but much more so than it hadever been before. The Punic Wars were wars of peoples, such as were no otherwars we have yet recorded. Indubitably the broad lines of our present world, themain ideas, the chief oppositions, were appearing in those days.But, as we have already pointed out, certain of the elementary facilities andsome of the current political ideas of our time were still wanting in the Romeof the Punic Wars. There were no newspapers,6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en108] and there was practically no use ofelected representatives in the popular assemblies. And another deficiency, veryunderstandable to us nowadays, but quite beyond the scope of anyone then, wasthe absence of any general elementary political education at all. The plebeiansof Rome had shown some glimmering of the idea that without knowledge votescannot make men free, when they had insisted upon the publication of the law ofthe Twelve Tables; but they had never been able, it was beyond the possibilitiesof the time, to imagine any further extension of knowledge to the bulk of thepeople. It is only nowadays that men are beginning to understand fully thepolitical significance of the maxim that “knowledge is power.” Two British TradeUnions, for example, have recently set up a Labour College to meet the specialneeds of able working-men in history, political and social science, and thelike. But education in republican Rome was the freak of the individual parent,and the privilege of wealth and leisure. It was mainly in the hands of Greeks,who were in many cases slaves. There was a thin small stream of very finelearning and very fine thinking up to the first century of the monarchy, letLucretius and Cicero witness, but it did not spread into the mass of the people.The ordinary Roman was not only blankly ignorant of the history of mankind, butalso of the conditions of foreign peoples; he had no knowledge of economic lawsnor of social possibilities. Even his own interests he did not clearlyunderstand.Of course, in the little city states of Greece and in that early Roman state offour hundred square miles, men acquired by talk and observation a sufficientknowledge for the ordinary duties of citizenship, but by the beginning of thePunic Wars the business was already too big and complicated for illiterate men.Yet nobody seems to have observed the gap that was opening between the citizenand his state, and so there is no record at all of any attempt to enlarge thecitizen by instruction to meet his enlarged duties. From the second century BCand onward everyone is remarking upon the ignorance of the common citizen andhis lack of political wisdom, everything is suffering from the lack of politicalsolidarity due to this ignorance, but no one goes on to what we should nowconsider the inevitable corollary, no one proposes to destroy the ignorancecomplained of. There existed no means whatever for the instruction of the massesof the people in a common political and social ideal. It was only with thedevelopment of the great propagandist religions in the Roman world, of whichChristianity was the chief and the survivor, that the possibility of such asystematic instruction of great masses of people became apparent in the world.That very great political genius, the Emperor Constantine the Great, sixcenturies later, was the first to apprehend and to attempt to use thispossibility for the preservation and the mental and moral knitting-together ofthe world community over which he ruled.But it is not only in these deficiencies of news and of education and of theexpedient of representative government that this political system of Romediffered from our own. True, it was far more like a modern civilized state thanany other state we have considered hitherto, but in some matters it wasstrangely primordial and “sub-civilized.” Every now and then the reader of Romanhistory, reading it in terms of debates and measures, policies and campaigns,capital and labour, comes upon something that gives him much the same shock hewould feel if he went down to an unknown caller in his house and extended hishand to meet the misshapen hairy paw of Homo Neanderthalensis and looked up tosee a chinless, bestial face. We have noted the occurrence of human sacrifice inthe third century BC, and much that we learn of the religion of republican Romecarries us far back beyond the days of decent gods, to the age of shamanism andmagic. We talk of a legislative gathering, and the mind flies to Westminster;but how should we feel if we went to see the beginning of a session of the Houseof Lords, and discovered the Lord Chancellor, with bloody fingers, portentouslyfiddling about among the entrails of a newly killed sheep? The mind would recoilfrom Westminster to the customs of Benin. And the slavery of Rome was a savageslavery, altogether viler than the slavery of Babylon. We have had a glimpse ofthe virtuous Cato among his slaves in the second century BC. Moreover, in thethird century BC, when King Asoka was ruling India in light and gentleness, theRomans were reviving an Etruscan sport, the setting on of slaves to fight fortheir lives. One is reminded of West Africa again in the origin of thisamusement; it grew out of the prehistoric custom of a massacre of captives atthe burial of a chief. There was a religious touch about this sport; the slaveswith hooks, who dragged the dead bodies out of the arena, wore masks torepresent the infernal ferryman-god, Charon. In 264 BC, the very year in whichAsoka began to reign and the First Punic War began, the first recordedgladiatorial combat took place in the forum at Rome, to celebrate the funeral ofa member of the old Roman family of Brutus. This was a modest display of threecouples, but soon gladiators were fighting by the hundred. The taste for thesecombats grew rapidly, and the wars supplied an abundance of captives. The oldRoman moralists, who were so severe upon kissing and women’s ornaments and Greekphilosophy, had nothing but good to say for this new development. So long aspain was inflicted, Roman morality, it would seem, was satisfied.157 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_157_r1.gif]If republican Rome was the first of modern self-governing national communities,she was certainly the “Neanderthal” form of them.In the course of the next two or three centuries the gladiatorial shows of Romegrew to immense proportions. To begin with, while wars were frequent, thegladiators were prisoners of war. They came with their characteristic nationalweapons, tattooed Britons, Moors, Scythians, negroes, and the like, and therewas perhaps some military value in these exhibitions. Then criminals of thelower classes condemned to death were also used. The ancient world did notunderstand that a criminal condemned to death still has rights, and at any ratethe use of a criminal as a gladiator was not so bad as his use as “material” forthe vivisectors of the Museum at Alexandria. But as the profits of this sort ofshow business grew and the demand for victims increased, ordinary slaves weresold to the trainers of gladiators, and any slave who had aroused his owner’sspite might find himself in an establishment for letting out gladiators. Anddissipated young men who had squandered their property, and lads of spirit wouldgo voluntarily into the trade for a stated time, trusting to their prowess tosurvive. As the business developed, a new use was found for gladiators as armedretainers; rich men would buy a band, and employ it as a bodyguard or hire itout for profit at the shows. The festivities of a show began with a ceremonialprocession (pompa) and a sham fight (prœlusio). The real fighting was heraldedby trumpets. Gladiators who objected to fight for any reason were driven on bywhips and hot irons. A wounded man would sometimes call for pity by holding uphis forefinger. The spectators would then either wave their handkerchiefs intoken of mercy, or condemn him to death by holding out their clenched fists withthe thumbs down.7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en109] The slain andnearly dead were dragged out to a particular place, the spoliarium, where theywere stripped of their arms and possessions, and those who had not alreadyexpired were killed.This organization of murder as a sport and show serves to measure the great gapin moral standards between the Roman community and our own. No doubt crueltiesand outrages upon human dignity as monstrous as this still go on in the world,but they do not go on in the name of the law and without a single dissentientvoice. For it is true that until the time of Seneca (first century AD) there isno record of any plain protest against this business. The conscience of mankindwas weaker and less intelligent then than now. Presently a new power was to comeinto the human conscience through the spread of Christianity. The spirit ofJesus in Christianity became the great antagonist in the later Roman state ofthese cruel shows and of slavery, and, as Christianity spread, these two evilthings dwindled and disappeared.8 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en110]"},{"pageContent":"158 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_158_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN 159[bano_9781411428843_oeb_159_r1.gif]FROM TIBERIUS GRACCHUS TO THE GOD EMPEROR IN ROME§ 1. THE SCIENCE OF THWARTING THE COMMON MAN. § 2. FINANCE IN THE ROMAN STATE. §3. THE LAST YEARS OF REPUBLICAN POLICTICS. § 4. THE ERA OF THE ADVENTURERGENERALS. § 5. THE END OF THE REPUBLIC. § 6. THE COMING OF THE PRINCEPS. § 7.WHY THE ROMAN REPUBLIC FAILED.§ 1WE HAVE ALREADY TWICE LIKENED THE SELF-GOVERNING COMMUNITY OF Rome to a“Neanderthal” variety of the modern “democratic” civilized state, and we shallrecur again to this comparison. In form the two things, the first greatprimitive essay and its later relations, are extraordinarily similar; in spiritthey differ very profoundly. Roman political and social life, and particularlyRoman political and social life in the century between the fall of Carthage andthe rise of Cæsar and Cæsarism, has a very marked general resemblance to thepolitical and social life in such countries as the United States of America orthe British Empire today. The resemblance is intensified by the common use, witha certain inaccuracy in every case, of such terms as “senate,” “democracy,”“proletariat,” and the like. But everything in the Roman state was earlier,cruder, and clumsier; the injustices were more glaring, the conflicts harsher.There was comparatively little knowledge and few general ideas. Aristotle’sscientific works were only beginning to be read in Rome in the first century BC;Ferrero,1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en111] it is true, makes Cæsarfamiliar with the Politics of Aristotle, and ascribes to him the dream of makinga “Periclean Rome,” but in doing so, Ferrero seems to be indulging in one ofthose lapses into picturesque romancing which are at once the joy and the snareof all historical writers.Attention has already been drawn to the profound difference between Roman andmodern conditions due to the absence of a press, of any popular education or ofthe representative idea in the popular assembly. Our world today is still farfrom solving the problem of representation and from producing a public assemblywhich will really summarize, crystallize, and express the thought and will ofthe community; our elections are still largely an ingenious mockery of thecommon voter who finds himself helpless in the face of party organizations whichreduce his free choice of a representative to the less unpalatable of twopolitical hacks, but, even so, his vote, in comparison with the vote of anordinary honest Roman citizen, is an effective instrument. Too many of ourhistories dealing with this period of Roman history write of “the popularparty,” and of the votes of the people and so forth, as though such things wereas much working realities as they are today. But the senators and politicians ofRome saw to it that such things never did exist as clean and wholesomerealities. These modern phrases are very misleading unless they are carefullyqualified.We have already described the gatherings of the popular comitia; but that clumsyassembly in sheep pens does not convey the full extent to which thegerrymandering of popular representation could be carried in Rome. Wheneverthere was a new enfranchisement of citizens in Italy, there would be the mostelaborate trickery and counter-trickery to enrol the new voters into as few oras many of the thirty old “tribes” as possible, or to put them into as few aspossible new tribes. Since the vote was taken by tribes, it is obvious thathowever great the number of new additions made, if they were all got togetherinto one tribe, their opinion would only count for one tribal vote, andsimilarly if they were crowded into just a few tribes, old or new. On the otherhand, if they were put into too many tribes their effect in any particular tribemight be inconsiderable. Here was the sort of work to fascinate every smartknave in politics. The comitia tributa could be worked at times so as to voteright counter to the general feeling of the people. And as we have alreadynoted, the great mass of voters in Italy were also disenfranchised by distance.About the middle period of the Carthaginian wars there were upwards of threehundred thousand Roman citizens; about 100 BC there were more than nine hundredthousand, but in effect the voting of the popular assembly was confined to a fewscore thousand resident in and near Rome, and mostly men of a base type. And theRoman voters were “organized” to an extent that makes the Tammany machine of NewYork seem artless and honest. They belonged to clubs, collegia sodalicia, havingusually some elegant religious pretensions; and the rising politician workinghis way to office went first to the usurers and then with the borrowed money tothese clubs. If the outside voters were moved enough by any question to swarminto the city, it was always possible to put off the voting by declaring theomens unfavourable. If they came in unarmed, they could be intimidated; if theybrought in arms, then the cry was raised that there was a plot to overthrow therepublic, and a massacre would be organized.There can be no doubt that all Italy, all the empire was festering withdiscomfort, anxiety, and discontent in the century after the destruction ofCarthage; a few men were growing very rich, and the majority of people foundthemselves entangled in an inexplicable net of uncertain prices, jumpy markets,and debts; but yet there was no way at all of stating and clearing up thegeneral dissatisfaction. There is no record of a single attempt to make thepopular assembly a straightforward and workable public organ. Beneath thesuperficial appearances of public affairs struggled a mute giant of publicopinion and public will, who sometimes made some great political effort a rushto vote or such like, and sometimes broke into actual violence. So long as therewas no actual violence, the Senate and the financiers kept on in their owndisastrous way. Only when they were badly frightened would governing cliques orparties desist from some nefarious policy and heed the common good. The realmethod of popular expression in Italy in those days was not the comitia tributa,but the strike and insurrection, the righteous and necessary methods of allcheated or suppressed peoples. We have seen in our own days in Great Britain adecline in the prestige of parliamentary government and a drift towardsunconstitutional methods on the part of the masses through exactly the samecause, through the incurable disposition of politicians to gerrymander theelectoral machine until the community is driven to explosion.For insurrectionary purposes a discontented population needs a leader, and thepolitical history of the concluding century of Roman republicanism is a historyof insurrectionary leaders and counterrevolutionary leaders. Most of the formerare manifestly unscrupulous adventurers who try to utilize the public necessityand unhappiness for their own advancement. Many of the historians of this periodbetray a disposition to take sides, and are either aristocratic in tone orfiercely democratic; but, indeed, neither side in these complex and intricatedisputes has a record of high aims or clean hands. The Senate and the richEquestrians were vulgar and greedy spirits, hostile and contemptuous towards thepoor mob; and the populace was ignorant, unstable, and at least equally greedy.The Scipios in all this record shine by comparison, a group of gentlemen. To themotives of one or the other figures of the time, to Tiberius Gracchus, forexample, we may perhaps extend the benefit of the doubt. But for the rest, theydo but demonstrate how clever and cunning men may be, how subtle in contention,how brilliant in pretence, and how utterly wanting in wisdom or grace of spirit.“A shambling, hairy, brutish, but probably very cunning creature with a bigbrain behind”; so someone, I think it was Sir Harry Johnston, has described HomoNeanderthalensis.To this day we must still use similar terms to describe the soul of thepolitician. The statesman has still to oust the politician from his lairs andweapon heaps. History has still to become a record of human dignity.§ 2Another respect in which the Roman system was a crude anticipation of our own,and different from any preceding political system we have considered, was thatit was a cash and credit-using system. Money had been in the world as yet foronly a few centuries. But its use had been growing; it was providing a fluidmedium for trade and enterprise, and changing economic conditions profoundly. Inrepublican Rome, the financier and the “money” interest began to play a partrecognizably similar to their roles today.We have already noted—in our account of Herodotus—that a first effect of moneywas to give freedom of movement and leisure to a number of people who could nototherwise have enjoyed these privileges. And that is the peculiar value of moneyto mankind. Instead of a worker or helper being paid in kind and in such a waythat he is tied as much in his enjoyment as in his labour, money leaves him freeto do as he pleases amidst a wide choice of purchasable aids, eases, andindulgences. He may eat his money or drink it or give it to a temple or spend itin learning something or save it against some unforeseen occasion. That is thegood of money, the freedom of its universal convertibility. But the freedommoney gives the poor man is nothing to the freedom money has given the rich man.With money rich men ceased to be tied to lands, houses, stores, flocks andherds. They could change the nature and locality of their possessions with anunheard-of freedom. In the third and second century BC, this release, thisuntethering of wealth, began to tell upon the general economic life of the Romanand Hellenized world. People began to buy land and the like not for use, but tosell again at a profit; people borrowed to buy, speculation developed. No doubtthere were bankers in the Babylon of 1000 BC, but they lent in a far morelimited and solid way, bars of metal and stocks of goods. That earlier world wasa world of barter and payment in kind, and it went slowly—and much more staidlyand stably—for that reason. In that state the vast realm of China has remainedalmost down to the present time.The big cities before Rome were trading and manufacturing cities. Such wereCorinth and Carthage and Syracuse. But Rome never produced a very considerableindustrial population, and her warehouses never rivalled those of Alexandria.The little port of Ostia was always big enough for her needs. Rome was apolitical and financial capital, and in the latter respect, at least, she was anew sort of city. She imported profits and tribute, and very little went outfrom her in return. The wharves of Ostia were chiefly busy unloading corn fromSicily and Africa and loot from all the world.After the fall of Carthage the Roman imagination went wild with the hithertounknown possibilities of finance. Money, like most other inventions, had“happened” to mankind, and men had still to develop—today they have still toperfect—the science and morality of money. One sees the thing “catching on” inthe recorded life and the writings of Cato the Censor. In his early days he wasbitterly virtuous against usury; in his later he was devising ingenious schemesfor safe usury.In this curiously interesting century of Roman history we find man after manasking, “What has happened to Rome?” Various answers are made—a decline inreligion, a decline from the virtues of the Roman forefathers, Greek“intellectual poison,” and the like. We who can look at the problem with a largeperspective, can see that what had happened to Rome was “money”—the new freedomsand chances and opportunities that money opened out. Money floated the Romansoff the firm ground, everyone was getting hold of money, the majority by thesimple expedient of running into debt; the eastward expansion of the empire wasvery largely a hunt for treasure in strong rooms and temples to keep pace withthe hunger of the new need. The Equestrian order, in particular, became themoney power. Everyone was developing property. Farmers were giving up corn andcattle, borrowing money, buying slaves, and starting the more intensivecultivation of oil and wine. Money was young in human experience and wild,nobody had it under control. It fluctuated greatly. It was now abundant and nowscarce. Men made sly and crude schemes to corner it, to hoard it, to send upprices by releasing hoarded metals. A small body of very shrewd men was growingimmensely rich. Many patricians were growing poor and irritated andunscrupulous. Among the middle sort of peoples there was much hope, muchadventure, and much more disappointment. The growing mass of the expropriatedwas permeated by that vague, baffled, and hopeless sense of being inexplicablybested, which is the preparatory condition for all great revolutionarymovements.§ 3The first conspicuous leader to appeal to the gathering revolutionary feeling inItaly was Tiberius Gracchus. He looks more like an honest man than any otherfigure in this period of history, unless it be Scipio Africanus the Elder. Atfirst Tiberius Gracchus was a moderate reformer of a rather reactionary type. Hewished to restore the yeoman class to property, very largely because he believedthat class to be the backbone of the army, and his military experience in Spainbefore and after the destruction of Carthage had impressed upon him thedeclining efficiency of the legions. He was what we should call nowadays a“Back-to-the-land” man. He did not understand and few people understand today,how much easier it is to shift population from the land into the towns, than toreturn it to the laborious and simple routines of agricultural life. He wantedto revive the Licinian laws, which had been established when Camillus built histemple of Concord nearly two centuries and a half before (see Chap. xxvi, § 2),so far as they broke up great estates and restrained slave labour.These Licinian laws had repeatedly been revived and repeatedly lapsed to a deadletter again. It was only when the big proprietors in the Senate opposed thisproposal that Tiberius Gracchus turned to the people and began a furiousagitation for popular government. He created a commission to inquire into thetitle of all landowners. In the midst of his activities occurred one of the mostextraordinary incidents in history. Attalus, the king of the rich country ofPergamum in Asia Minor, died (133 BC), and left his kingdom to the Roman people.It is difficult for us to understand the motives of this bequest. Pergamum was acountry allied to Rome, and so moderately secure from aggression; and thenatural consequence of such a will was to provoke a violent scramble among thesenatorial gangs and a dispute between them and the people for the spoils of thenew acquisition. Practically Attalus handed over his country to be looted. Therewere of course many Italian business people established in the country and astrong party of native rich men in close relations with Rome. To them, no doubt,a coalescence with the Roman system would have been acceptable. Josephus bearswitness to such a desire for annexation among the rich men of Syria, a desirerunning counter to the wishes of both king and people. This Pergamum bequest,astonishing in itself, had the still more astonishing result of producingimitations in other quarters. In 96 BC Ptolemy Apion bequeathed Cyrenaica, inNorth Africa, to the Roman people; in 81 BC Alexander II, King of Egypt,followed suit with Egypt, a legacy too big for the courage if not for theappetite of the Senators, and they declined it; in 74 BC Nicomedes, King ofBithynia, demised Bithynia. Of these latter testamentary freaks we will say nomore here. But it will be manifest how great an opportunity was given TiberiusGracchus by the bequest of Attalus, of accusing the rich of greed and ofproposing to decree the treasures of Attalus to the commonalty. He proposed touse this new wealth to provide seed, stock, and agricultural implements for theresettlement of the land.His movement was speedily entangled in the complexities of the Roman electoralsystem—without a simple and straightforward electoral method, all popularmovements in all ages necessarily become entangled and maddened inconstitutional intricacies, and almost as necessarily lead to bloodshed. It wasneeded, if his work was to go on, that Tiberius Gracchus should continue to betribune, and it was illegal for him to be tribune twice in succession. Heoverstepped the bounds of legality, and stood for the tribuneship a second time;the peasants who came in from the countryside to vote for him came in armed; thecry that he was aiming at a tyranny, the cry that had long ago destroyed Mæliusand Manlius, was raised in the Senate, the friends of “law and order” went tothe Capitol in state, accompanied by a rabble of dependents armed with stavesand bludgeons; there was a conflict, or rather a massacre of therevolutionaries, in which nearly three hundred people were killed, and TiberiusGracchus was beaten to death with the fragments of a broken bench by twoSenators.Thereupon the Senators attempted a sort of counterrevolution, and proscribedmany of the followers of Tiberius Gracchus; but the state of public opinion wasso sullen and threatening that this movement was dropped and Scipio Nasica, whowas implicated in the death of Tiberius, though he occupied the position ofpontifex maximus and should have remained in Rome for the public sacrificeswhich were the duties of that official, went abroad to avoid trouble.The uneasiness of Italy next roused Scipio Africanus the Younger to propose theenfranchisement of all Italy. But he died suddenly before he could carry theproposal into effect.Then followed the ambiguous career of Caius Gracchus, the brother of Tiberius,who followed some tortuous “policy” that still exercises the mind of historians.He increased the burthens of taxation laid upon the provinces, it is supposedwith the idea of setting the modern financiers (the Equites) against thesenatorial landowners. He gave the former the newly bequeathed taxes of Asia tofarm, and, what is worse, he gave them control of the special courts set up toprevent extortion. He started enormous public works and particularly theconstruction of new roads, and he is accused of making a political use of thecontracts. He revived the proposal to enfranchise Italy. He increased thedistribution of subsidized cheap corn to the Roman citizens. . . . Here wecannot attempt to disentangle his schemes, much less to judge him. But that hispolicy was offensive to the groups that controlled the Senate there can be nodoubt whatever. He was massacred by the champions of “law and order,” with aboutthree thousands of his followers, in the streets of Rome in 121 BC. Hisdecapitated head was carried to the Senate on the point of a pike.(A reward of its weight in gold, says Plutarch, had been offered for thistrophy: and its captor, acting in the true spirit of a champion of “bigbusiness,” filled the brain-case with lead on its way to the scales).“In spite of these prompt firm measures the Senate was not to enjoy the benefitsof peace and the advantages of a control of the imperial resources for long.Within ten years the people were in revolt again.”In 118 BC the throne of Numidia, the semi-barbaric kingdom that had arisen inNorth Africa upon the ruins of the civilized Carthaginian power, was seized by acertain able Jugurtha, who had served with the Roman armies in Spain, and had aknowledge of the Roman character. He provoked the military intervention of Rome.But the Romans found that their military power, under a Senate of financiers andlandlords, was very different from what it had been even in the days of theyounger Scipio Africanus. “Jugurtha bought over the Commissioners sent out towatch him, the Senators charged with their prosecution, and the generals incommand against him.”2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en112] There is amistaken Roman proverb: “pecunia non olet” (money does not stink), for the moneyof Jugurtha stank even in Rome. There was an angry agitation; and a capablesoldier of lowly origin, Marius, was carried to the consulship (107 BC) on thewave of popular indignation. Marius made no attempt on the model of the Gracchito restore the backbone of the army by rehabilitating the yeoman class. He was aprofessional soldier with a high standard of efficiency and a disposition totake short cuts. He simply raised troops from among the poor, whether countrymenor townsmen, paid them well, disciplined them thoroughly, and (106 BC) ended theseven years’ war with Jugurtha by bringing that chieftain in chains to Rome. Itdid not occur to anybody that incidentally Marius had also created aprofessional army with no interest to hold it together but its pay. He then heldon to the consulship more or less illegally for several years, and in 102 and101 BC repelled a threatening move of the Germans (who thus appear in ourhistory for the first time), who were raiding through Gaul towards Italy. Hegained two victories; one on Italian soil. He was hailed as the saviour of hiscountry, a second Camillus (100 BC).The social tensions of the time mocked that comparison with Camillus. The Senatebenefited by the greater energy in foreign affairs and the increased militaryefficiency that Marius had introduced, but the sullen, shapeless discontent ofthe mass of the people was still seeking some effective outlet. The rich grewricher and the poor poorer. It was impossible to stifle the consequences of thatprocess forever by political trickery. The Italian people were stillunenfranchised. Two extreme democratic leaders, Saturninus and Glaucia, wereassassinated, but that familiar senatorial remedy failed to assuage the populaceon this occasion. In 92 BC an aristocratic official, Rutilius Rufus, who hadtried to restrain the exactions of the financiers in Asia Minor, was condemnedon a charge of corruption so manifestly trumped up that it deceived no one; andin 91 BC, Livius Drusus, a newly elected tribune of the people, who was makingcapital out of the trial of Rutilius Rufus, was assassinated. He had proposed ageneral enfranchisement of the Italians, and he had foreshadowed not onlyanother land law, but a general abolition of debts. Yet for all this vigour onthe part of the senatorial usurers, landgrabbers, and forestallers, the hungryand the anxious were still insurgent. The murder of Drusus was the last drop inthe popular cup; Italy blazed into a desperate insurrection.There followed two years of bitter civil war, the Social War. It was a warbetween the idea of a united Italy and the idea of the rule of the Roman Senate.It was not a “social” war in the modern sense, but a war between Rome and herItalian allies (allies = Socii). “Roman generals, trained in the traditions ofcolonial warfare, marched ruthlessly up and down Italy, burning farms, sackingtowns, and carrying off men, women, and children, to sell them in the openmarket or work them in gangs upon their estates.”3[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en113] Marius and an aristocratic general,Sulla, who had been with him in Africa and who was his bitter rival, bothcommanded on the side of Rome. But though the insurgents experienced defeats andlooting, neither of these generals brought the war to an end. It was ended in amanner (89 BC) by the practical surrender of the Roman Senate to the idea ofreform. The spirit was taken out of the insurrection by the concession of theirdemands “in principle”; and then as soon as the rebels had dispersed, the usualcheating of the new voters, by such methods as we have explained in § 1 of thischapter, was resumed.By the next year (88 BC) the old round had begun again. It was mixed up with thepersonal intrigues of Marius and Sulla against each other; but the struggle hadtaken on another complexion through the army reforms of Marius, which hadcreated a new type of legionary, a landless professional soldier with nointerest in life but pay and plunder, and with no feeling of loyalty except to asuccessful general. A popular tribune, Sulpicius, was bringing forward some newlaws affecting debt, and the consuls were dodging the storm by declaring asuspension of public business. Then came the usual resort to violence, and thefollowers of Sulpicius drove the consuls from the forum. But here it is that thenew forces which the new army had made possible came into play. King Mithridatesof Pontus, the Hellenized king of the southern shores of the Black Sea east ofBithynia, was pressing Rome into war. One of the proposed laws of Sulpicius wasthat Marius should command the armies sent against this Mithridates. WhereuponSulla marched the army he had commanded throughout the Social War to Rome,Marius and Sulpicius fled, and a new age, an age of military pronunciamentos,began.Of how Sulla had himself made commander against Mithridates and departed, and ofhow legions friendly to Marius then seized power, how Marius returned to Italyand enjoyed a thorough massacre of his political opponents and died, sated, offever, we cannot tell in any detail. But one measure during the Marian reign ofterror did much to relieve the social tension, and that was the abolition ofthree-quarters of all outstanding debts. Nor can we tell here how Sulla made adiscreditable peace with Mithridates (who had massacred a hundred thousandItalians in Asia Minor) in order to bring his legions back to Rome, defeat theMarians at the battle of the Colline Gate of Rome, and reverse the arrangementsof Marius. Sulla restored law and order by the proscription and execution ofover five thousand people. He desolated large parts of Italy, restored theSenate to power, repealed many of the recent laws, though he was unable torestore the cancelled burden of debt, and then, feeling bored by politics andhaving amassed great riches, he retired with an air of dignity into privatelife, gave himself up to abominable vices, and so presently died, eaten up withsome disgusting disease produced by debauchery.4[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en114]§ 4Political life in Italy was not so much tranquillized as stunned by themassacres and confiscations of Marius and Sulla. The scale upon which thishistory is planned will not permit us to tell here of the great adventurers who,relying more and more on the support of the legions, presently began to schemeand intrigue again for dictatorial power in Rome. In 73 BC all Italy wasterrified by a rising of the slaves, and particularly of the gladiators, led bya gladiator from Thessaly, Spartacus. He and seventy others had fled out from agladiatorial “farm” at Capua. Similar risings had already occurred in Sicily.The forces under Spartacus necessarily became a miscellaneous band drawn fromeast and west, without any common idea except the idea of dispersing and gettinghome; nevertheless, he held out in southern Italy for two years, using the thenapparently extinct crater of Vesuvius for a time as a natural fortress. TheItalians, for all their love of gladiatorial display, failed to appreciate thisconversion of the whole country into an arena, this bringing of the gladiatorialsword to the door, and when at last Spartacus was overthrown, their terrorchanged to frantic cruelty, six thousand of his captured followers werecrucified—long miles of nailed and drooping victims—along the Appian Way.Here we cannot deal at any length with Lucullus, who invaded Pontus and foughtMithridates, and brought the cultivated cherry tree to Europe; nor can we tellhow ingeniously Pompey the Great stole the triumph and most of the prestigeLucullus had won in Armenia beyond Pontus. Lucullus, like Sulla, retired into anopulent private life, but with more elegance and with a more gracious end. Wecannot relate in any detail how Julius Cæsar accumulated reputation in the west,by conquering Gaul, defeating the German tribes upon the Rhine, and pushing apunitive raid across the Straits of Dover into Britain. More and more importantgrow the legions; less and less significant are the Senate and the assemblies ofRome. But there is a certain grim humour about the story of Crassus that wecannot altogether neglect.This Crassus was a great money-lender and forestaller. He was a typical man ofthe new Equestrian type, the social equivalent of a modern munition profiteer.He first grew rich by buying up the property of those proscribed by Sulla. Hisearliest exploits in the field were against Spartacus, whom finally he crushedby great payments and exertions after a prolonged and expensive campaign. Hethen, as the outcome of complicated bargains, secured the command in the eastand prepared to emulate the glories of Lucullus, who had pushed east fromPergamum and Bithynia into Pontus, and of Pompey, who had completed the lootingof Armenia.160 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_160_r1.gif]His experiences serve to demonstrate the gross ignorance with which the Romanswere conducting their affairs at that time. He crossed the Euphrates, expectingto find in Persia another Hellenized kingdom like Pontus. But, as we havealready intimated, the great reservoirs of nomadic peoples that stretched roundfrom the Danube across Russia into Central Asia, had been raining back into thelands between the Caspian Sea and the Indus that Alexander had conquered forHellenism. Crassus found himself against the “Scythian” again; against mobiletribes of horsemen led by a monarch in Median costume.5[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en115] The particular variety of “Scythian”he encountered was called the Parthian. It is possible that in the Parthians aMongolian (Turanian) element was now mingled with the Aryan strain; but thecampaign of Crassus beyond the Euphrates is curiously like the campaign ofDarius beyond the Danube; there is the same heavy thrusting of an infantry forceagainst elusive light horsemen. But Crassus was less quick than Darius torealize the need of withdrawal, and the Parthians were better bowmen than theScythians Darius met. They seem to have had some sort of noisy projectile ofunusual strength and force, something different from an ordinary arrow.6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en116] The campaign culminated in that twodays’ massacre of the hot, thirsty, hungry, and weary Roman legions which isknown as the battle of Carrhæ (53 BC). They toiled through the sand, charging anenemy who always evaded their charge and rode round them and shot them topieces. Twenty thousand of them were killed, and ten thousand marched oneastward as prisoners into slavery in Iran.What became of Crassus is not clearly known. There is a story, probably inventedfor our moral benefit and suggested by his usuries, that he fell alive into thehands of the Parthians and was killed by having molten gold poured down histhroat.But this disaster has a very great significance indeed to our general history ofmankind. It serves to remind us that from the Rhine to the Euphrates, all alongto the north of the Alps and Danube and Black Sea, stretched one continuouscloud of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples, whom the statescraft of imperial Romewas never able to pacify and civilize, nor her military science subdue. We havealready called attention to a map showing how the Second Babylonian Empire, theChaldean Empire, lay like a lamb in the embrace of the Median power. In exactlythe same way the Roman Empire lay like a lamb in the embrace of this greatcrescent of outer barbarians. Not only was Rome never able to thrust back orassimilate that superincumbent crescent, but she was never able to organize theMediterranean Sea into a secure and orderly system of communication between onepart of her empire and another. Quite unknown as yet to Rome, the Mongoliantribes from Northeastern Asia, the Huns and their kin, walled back and drivenout from China by the Tsi and Han dynasties, were drifting and pressingwestward, mixing with the Parthians, the Scythians, the Teutons and the like, ordriving them before them.Never at anytime did the Romans succeed in pushing their empire beyondMesopotamia, and upon Mesopotamia their hold was never very secure. Before theclose of the republic that power of assimilation which had been the secret oftheir success was giving way to “patriotic” exclusiveness and “patriotic” greed.Rome plundered and destroyed Asia Minor and Babylonia, which were the necessarybasis for an eastward extension to India, just as she had destroyed and lootedCarthage and so had no foothold for extension into Africa, and just as she haddestroyed Corinth and so cut herself off from an easy way into the heart ofGreece. Western European writers, impressed by the fact that later on RomeRomanized and civilized Gaul and South Britain and restored the scene of herearlier devastations in Spain to prosperity, are apt to ignore that over fargreater areas to the south and east her influence was to weaken and so restoreto barbarism the far wider conquests of Hellenic civilization.§ 5But among the politicians of Italy in the first century BC there were no maps ofGermany and Russia, Africa and Central Asia, and no sufficient intelligence tostudy them had they existed. Rome never developed the fine curiosities that sentHanno and the sailors of Pharaoh Necho down the coasts of Africa. When, in thefirst century BC, the emissaries of the Han dynasty reached the eastern shoresof the Caspian Sea, they found only stories of a civilization that had receded.The memory of Alexander still lived in these lands, but of Rome men only knewthat Pompey had come to the western shores of the Caspian and gone away again,and that Crassus had been destroyed. Rome was preoccupied at home. What mentalenergy remained over in the Roman citizen from the attempt to grow personallyrich and keep personally safe was intent upon the stratagems and strokes andcounterstrokes of the various adventurers who were now manifestly grappling forthe supreme power.It is the custom of historians to treat these struggles with extreme respect. Inparticular the figure of Julius Cæsar is set up as if it were a star of supremebrightness and importance in the history of mankind. Yet a dispassionateconsideration of the known facts fails altogether to justify this demigod theoryof Cæsar. Not even that precipitate wrecker of splendid possibilities, Alexanderthe Great, has been so magnified and dressed up for the admiration of carelessand uncritical readers. There is a type of scholar who, to be plain, sits andinvents marvellous world policies for the more conspicuous figures in historywith the merest scraps of justification or with no justification at all. We aretold that Alexander planned the conquest of Carthage and Rome and the completesubjugation of India and that only his death shattered these schemes. What weknow for certain is that he conquered the Persian Empire, and never went farbeyond its boundaries; and that when he was supposed to be making these vast andnoble plans, he was in fact indulging in such monstrous antics as his mourningfor his favourite Hephæstion, and as his main occupation he was drinking himselfto death. So, too, Julius Cæsar is credited with the intention of doing justthat one not impossible thing which would have secured the Roman Empire from itsultimate collapse—namely, the systematic conquest and civilization of Europe asfar as the Baltic and the Dnieper. He was to have marched upon Germany, saysPlutarch, through Parthia and Scythia, round the north of the Caspian and BlackSeas. Yet the fact we have to reconcile with this wise and magnificent projectis that at the crest of his power, Cæsar, already a bald, middle-aged man, pastthe graces and hot impulses of youthful love, spent the better part of a year inEgypt, feasting and entertaining himself in amorous pleasantries with theEgyptian queen, Cleopatra. And afterwards he brought her with him to Rome, whereher influence over him was bitterly resented. Such complications with a womanmark the elderly sensualist or sentimentalist—he was fifty-four at thecommencement of the affaire—rather than the master-ruler of men.On the side of the superman idea of Cæsar, we have to count a bust in the NaplesMuseum. It represents a fine and intellectual face, very noble in itsexpression, and we can couple with that the story that his head, even at birth,was unusually large and finely formed. But there is really no satisfyingevidence that this well-known bust does represent Cæsar, and it is hard toreconcile its austere serenity with the reputation for violent impulse anddisorderliness that clung to him. Other busts of a quite different man are also,with more probability, ascribed to him.There can be little doubt that he was a dissolute and extravagant young man—thescandals cluster thick about his sojourn in Bithynia, whither he fled fromSulla; he was the associate of the reprobate Clodius and the conspiratorCatiline, and there is nothing in his political career to suggest any aim higheror remoter than his own advancement to power, and all the personal glory andindulgence that power makes possible. We will not attempt to tell here of theturns and devices of his career. Although he was of an old patrician family, hecame into politics as the brilliant darling of the people. He spent great sumsand incurred heavy debts to provide public festivals on the most lavish scale.He opposed the tradition of Sulla, and cherished the memory of Marius, who washis uncle by marriage. For a time he worked in conjunction with Crassus andPompey, but after the death of Crassus he and Pompey came into conflict. By 49BC he and Pompey, with their legions, he from the west and Pompey from the east,were fighting openly for predominance in the Roman state. He had broken the lawby bringing his legions across the Rubicon, which was the boundary between hiscommand and Italy proper. At the battle of Pharsalos in Thessaly (48 BC), Pompeywas routed, and, fleeing to Egypt, was murdered, leaving Cæsar more master ofthe Roman world than ever Sulla had been.161 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_161_r1.gif]He was then created dictator for ten years in 46 BC, and early in 45 BC he wasmade dictator for life. This was monarchy; if not hereditary monarchy, it was atleast electoral life monarchy. It was unlimited opportunity to do his best forthe world.And by the spirit and quality of his use of this dictatorial power during thesefour years we are bound to judge him. A certain reorganization of localadministration he effected, and he seems to have taken up what was a fairlyobvious necessity of the times, a project for the restoration of the twomurdered seaports of Corinth and Carthage, whose destruction had wrecked thesea-life of the Mediterranean. But much more evident was the influence ofCleopatra and Egypt upon his mind. Like Alexander before him, his head seems tohave been turned by the king-god tradition, assisted no doubt in his case by theadulation of that charming hereditary goddess, Cleopatra. We find evidence ofexactly that same conflict upon the score of divine pretensions, between him andhis personal friends, that we have already recorded in the case of Alexander. Sofar as the Hellenized east was concerned, the paying of divine honours to rulerswas a familiar idea; but it was still repulsive to the lingering Aryanism ofRome.Antony, who had been his second in command at Pharsalos, was one of the chief ofhis flatterers. Plutarch describes a scene at the public games in which Antonytried to force a crown upon Cæsar, which Cæsar, after a little coyness and inface of the manifested displeasure of the crowd, refused. But he had adopted theivory sceptre and throne, which were the traditional insignia of the ancientkings of Rome. His image was carried amidst that of the gods in the openingpompa of the arena, and his statue was set up in a temple with an inscription,“To the Unconquerable God!” Priests even were appointed for his godhead. Thesethings are not the symptoms of great-mindedness, but of a common man’smegalomania. Cæsar’s record of vulgar scheming for the tawdriest mockeries ofpersonal worship is a silly and shameful record; it is incompatible with theidea that he was a wise and wonderful superman setting the world to rights.Finally (44 BC) he was assassinated by a group of his own friends andsupporters, to whom these divine aspirations had become intolerable. He wasbeset in the Senate, and stabbed in three and twenty places, dying at the footof the statue of his fallen rival Pompey the Great. The scene marks the completedemoralization of the old Roman governing body. Brutus, the ringleader of themurderers, would have addressed the senators, but, confronted by this crisis,they were scuttling off in every direction. For the best part of a day Rome didnot know what to make of this event; the murderers marched about with theirbloody weapons through an undecided city, with no one gainsaying them and only afew joining them; then public opinion turned against them, some of their houseswere attacked, and they had to hide and fly for their lives.§ 6But the trend of things was overwhelmingly towards monarchy. For thirteen yearsmore the struggle of personalities went on. One single man is to be noted asinspired by broad ideas and an ambition not entirely egoistic, Cicero. He was aman of modest origin, whose eloquence and literary power had won him a prominentplace in the Senate. He was a little tainted by the abusive tradition ofDemosthenes, nevertheless he stands out, a noble and pathetically ineffectivefigure, pleading with the now utterly degenerate, base, and cowardly Senate forthe high ideals of the Republic. He was a writer of great care and distinction,and the orations and private letters he has left us make him one of the mostreal and living figures of this period to the modern reader. He was proscribedand killed in 43 BC, the year after the murder of Julius Cæsar, and his head andhands were nailed up in the Roman forum. Octavian, who became at last themonarch of Rome, seems to have made an effort to save Cicero; that murder wascertainly not his crime.Here we cannot trace out the tangle of alliances and betrayals that ended in theascendancy of this Octavian, the adopted heir of Julius Cæsar. The fate of thechief figures is interwoven with that of Cleopatra.After the death of Cæsar, she set herself to capture the emotions and vanity ofAntony, a much younger man than Cæsar, with whom she was probably alreadyacquainted. For a time Octavian and Antony and a third figure, Lepidus, dividedthe Roman world just as Cæsar and Pompey had divided it before their finalconflict. Octavian took the hardier west, and consolidated his power; Antony hadthe more gorgeous east—and Cleopatra. To Lepidus fell that picked bone,Carthaginian Africa. He seems to have been a good man of good traditions, setupon the restoration of Carthage rather than upon wealth or personal vanities.The mind of Antony succumbed to those same ancient ideas of divine kingship thathad already proved too much for the mental equilibrium of Julius Cæsar. In thecompany of Cleopatra he gave himself up to love, amusements, and a dream ofsensuous glory, until Octavian felt that the time was ripe to end these twoEgyptian divinities.In 32 BC Octavian induced the Senate to depose Antony from the command of theeast, and proceeded to attack him. A great naval battle at Actium (31 BC) wasdecided by the unexpected desertion of Cleopatra with sixty ships in the midstof the fight. It is quite impossible for us to decide now whether this was dueto premeditated treachery or to the sudden whim of a charming woman. Thedeparture of these ships threw the fleet of Antony into hopeless confusion,which was increased by the headlong flight of this model lover in pursuit. Hewent off in a swift galley after her without informing his commanders. He lefthis followers to fight and die as they thought fit, and for a time they wereincredulous that he had gone. The subsequent encounter of the two lovers andtheir reconciliation is a matter for ironical speculation on the part ofPlutarch.Octavian’s net closed slowly round his rival. It is not improbable that therewas some sort of understanding between Octavian and Cleopatra, as perhaps in thetime of Julius Cæsar there may have been between the queen and Antony. Antonygave way to much mournful posturing, varied by love scenes, during this laststage of his little drama. For a time he posed as an imitator of the cynicTimon, as one who had lost all faith in mankind, though one may think that hisdeserted sailors at Actium had better reason for such an attitude. Finally hefound himself and Cleopatra besieged by Octavian in Alexandria. There were somesallies and minor successes, and Antony was loud with challenges to Octavian todecide the matter by personal combat. Being led to believe that Cleopatra hadcommitted suicide, this star of romance stabbed himself, but so ineffectually asto die lingeringly, and he was carried off to expire in her presence (30 BC).Plutarch’s account of Antony, which was derived very largely from witnesses whohad seen and known him, describes him as of heroic mould. He is compared to thedemigod Hercules, from whom indeed he claimed descent, and also to the IndianBacchus. There is a disgusting but illuminating description of a scene in theSenate when he attempted to speak while drunk, and was overtaken by one of theleast dignified concomitants of intoxication.For a little while Cleopatra still clung to life, and perhaps to the hope thatshe might reduce Octavian to the same divine role that had already been playedby Julius Cæsar and Antony. She had an interview with Octavian, in which shepresented herself as beauty in distress and very lightly clad. But when itbecame manifest that Octavian lacked the godlike spark, and that his care forher comfort and welfare was dictated chiefly by his desire to exhibit her in atriumphal procession through the streets of Rome, she also committed suicide. Anasp was smuggled to her past the Roman sentries, concealed in a basket of figs,and by its fangs she died.Octavian seems to have been almost entirely free from the divine aspirations ofJulius Cæsar and Antony. He was neither God nor romantic hero; he was a man. Hewas a man of far greater breadth and capacity than any other player in this lastact of the Republican drama in Rome. All things considered, he was perhaps thebest thing that could have happened to Rome at that time. He. . . voluntarily resigned the extraordinary powers which he had held sinceforty-three, and, to quote his own words, “handed over the republic to thecontrol of the senate and the people of Rome.” The old constitutional machinerywas once more set in motion; the senate, assembly, and magistrates resumed theirfunctions, and Octavian himself was hailed as the “restorer of the commonwealthand the champion of freedom.” It was not so easy to determine what relation hehimself, the actual master of the Roman world, should occupy towards thisrevived republic. His abdication, in any real sense of the word, would havesimply thrown everything back into confusion. The interests of peace and orderrequired that he should retain at least the substantial part of his authority;and this object was in fact accomplished, and the rule of the emperors foundedin a manner which has no parallel in history. Any revival of the kingly titlewas out of the question, and Octavian himself expressly refused thedictatorship. Nor was any new office created or any new official title inventedfor his benefit. But by senate and people he was invested according to the oldconstitutional forms with certain powers, as many citizens had been before him,and so took his place by the side of the lawfully appointed magistrates of therepublic; only, to mark his preeminent dignity, as the first of them all, thesenate decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen that of “Augustus,”while in common parlance he was henceforth styled Princeps, a simple title ofcourtesy, familiar to republican usage and conveying no other idea than that ofa recognized primacy and precedence over his fellow-citizens. The ideal sketchedby Cicero in his De Republica, of a constitutional president of a free republic,was apparently realized; but it was only in appearance. For in fact the specialprerogatives conferred upon Octavian gave him back in substance the autocraticauthority he had resigned, and as between the restored republic and its newprinceps the balance of power was overwhelmingly on the side of the latter.7[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en117]§ 7In this manner it was that Roman republicanism ended in a princeps or rulingprince, and the first great experiment in a self-governing community on a scalelarger than that of tribe or city, collapsed and failed. The essence of itsfailure was that it could not sustain unity. In its early stages its citizens,both patrician and plebeian, had a certain tradition of justice and good faith,and of the loyalty of all citizens to the law, and of the goodness of the lawfor all citizens; it clung to this idea of the importance of the law and oflaw-abidingness nearly into the first century BC. But the unforeseen inventionand development of money, the temptations and disruptions of imperial expansion,the entanglement of electoral methods, weakened and swamped this tradition bypresenting old issues in new disguises under which the judgment did notrecognize them, and by enabling men to be loyal to the professions ofcitizenship and disloyal to its spirit. The bond of the Roman people had alwaysbeen a moral rather than a religious bond; their religion was sacrificial andsuperstitious; it embodied no such great ideas of a divine leader and of asacred mission as Judaism was developing. As the idea of citizenship failed andfaded before the new occasions, there remained no inner, that is to say no real,unity in the system at all. Every man tended more and more to do what was rightin his own eyes. Under such conditions there was no choice between chaos and areturn to monarchy, to the acceptance of some chosen individual as the oneunifying will in the state. Of course in that return there is always hidden theexpectation that the monarch will become as it were magic, will cease to bemerely a petty human being, and will think and feel as something greater andmore noble, as indeed a state personage; and of course monarchy invariablyfails, to satisfy that expectation. We shall glance at the extent of thisfailure in the brief review we shall presently make of the emperors of Rome. Weshall find at last one of the more constructive of these emperors, Constantinethe Great, conscious of his own inadequacy as a unifying power, turning to thefaith, the organization, and teaching network of one of the new religiousmovements in the empire, to supply just that permeating and correlating factorin men’s minds that was so manifestly wanting.With Cæsar, the civilization of Europe and Western Asia went back to monarchy,and, through monarchy, assisted presently by organized Christianity, it soughtto achieve peace, righteousness, happiness, and world order for close uponeighteen centuries. Then almost suddenly it began reverting to republicanism,first in one country and then in another, and, assisted by the new powers ofprinting and the press and of organized general education, and by theuniversalist religious ideas in which the world had been soaked for generations,it seems now to have resumed again the effort to create a republican,world-state and a worldwide scheme of economic righteousness which the Romanshad made so prematurely and in which they had so utterly and disastrouslyfailed.162 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_162_r1.gif]Certain conditions, we are now beginning to perceive, are absolutely necessaryto such a creation; conditions which it is inconceivable that any pre-ChristianRoman could have regarded as possible. We may still think the attainment ofthese conditions a vastly laborious and difficult and uncertain undertaking, butwe understand that the attempt must be made because no other prospect before usgives even a promise of happiness or self-respect or preservation of our kind.The first of these conditions is that there should be a common political idea inthe minds of all men, an idea of the state thought of as the personal possessionof each individual and as the backbone fact of his scheme of duties. In theearly days of Rome, when it was a little visible state, twenty miles square,such notions could be and were developed in children in their homes, and by whatthey saw and heard of the political lives of their fathers; but in a largercountry such as Rome had already become before the war with Pyrrhus, there was aneed of an organized teaching of the history, of the main laws, and of thegeneral intentions of the state towards everyone if this moral unity was to bemaintained. But the need was never realized, and no attempt at any such teachingwas ever made. At the time it could not have been made. It is inconceivable thatit could have been made. The knowledge was not there, and there existed no classfrom which the needed teachers could be drawn and no conception of anorganization for any such systematic moral and intellectual training as theteaching organization of Christianity, with its creeds and catechisms andsermons and confirmations, presently supplied.Moreover, we know nowadays that even a universal education of this sort suppliesonly the basis for a healthy republican state. Next to education there must comeabundant, prompt, and truthful information of what is going on in the state, andfrank and free discussion of the issues of the time. Even nowadays thesefunctions are performed only very imperfectly and badly by the press we have andby our publicists and politicians; but badly though it is done, the thing isdone, and the fact that it is done at all argues that it may ultimately be donewell. In the Roman state it was not even attempted. The Roman citizen got hispolitical facts from rumour and the occasional orator. He stood wedged in theforum, imperfectly hearing a distant speaker. He probably misconceived everyissue upon which he voted.And of the monstrous ineffectiveness of the Roman voting system we have alreadywritten.Unable to surmount or remove these obstacles to a sane and effective populargovernment, the political instincts of the Roman mind turned towards monarchy.But it was not monarchy of the later European type, not hereditary monarchy,which was now installed in Rome. The princeps was really like an Americanwartime president, but he was elected not for four years but for life, he wasable to appoint senators instead of being restrained by an elected senate, andwith a rabble popular meeting in the place of the house of representatives. Hewas also pontifex maximus, chief of the sacrificial priests, a function unknownat Washington; and in practice it became usual for him to designate and trainhis successor and to select for that honour a son or an adopted son or a nearrelation whom he could trust. The power of the princeps was in itself enormousto entrust to the hands of a single man without any adequate checks, but it wasfurther enhanced by the tradition of monarch-worship which had now spread outfrom Egypt over the entire Hellenized east, and which was coming to Rome in thehead of every Oriental slave and immigrant. By natural and imperceptible degreesthe idea of the god-emperor came to dominate the whole Romanized world.Only one thing presently remained to remind the god-emperor that he was mortal,and that was the army. The god-emperor was never safe upon the Olympus of thePalatine Hill at Rome. He was only secure while he was the beloved captain ofhis legions. And as a consequence only the hardworking emperors who kept theirlegions active and in close touch with themselves had long reigns. The swordoverhung the emperor and spurred him to incessant activity. If he left things tohis generals, one of those generals presently replaced him. This spur wasperhaps the redeeming feature of the Roman Imperial system. In the greater,compacter, and securer empire of China there was not the same need of legions,and so there was not the same swift end for lazy or dissipated or juvenilemonarchs that overtook such types in Rome."},{"pageContent":"163 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_163_r1.gif]CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT 164[bano_9781411428843_oeb_164_r1.gif]THE CÆSARS BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE GREAT PLAINS OF THE OLD WORLD§ 1.

THE EASTERN (REVIVED HELLENIC)EMPIRE.§ 1WESTERN WRITERS ARE APT, THROUGH THEIR PATRIOTIC PREDISPOSITIONS, tooverestimate the organization, civilizing work, and security of the absolutemonarchy that established itself in Rome after the accession of Augustus Cæsar.From it we derive the political traditions of Britain, France, Spain, Germany,and Italy, and these countries loom big in the perspectives of European writers.By the scale of a world history the Roman Empire ceases to seem sooverwhelmingly important. It lasted about four centuries in all before it wascompletely shattered. The Byzantine Empire was no genuine continuation of it; itwas a resumption of the Hellenic Empire of Alexander; it spoke Greek; itsmonarch had a Roman title no doubt, but so for that matter had the late Tsar ofBulgaria. During its four centuries of life the empire of Rome had phases ofdivision and complete chaos; its prosperous years, if they are gathered togetherand added up, do not amount in all to a couple of centuries. Compared with thequiet steady expansion, the security, and the civilizing task of thecontemporary Chinese Empire, or with Egypt between 4000 and 1000 BC, or withSumeria before the Semitic conquest, this amounts to a mere incident in history.The Persian Empire of Cyrus again, which reached from the Hellespont to theIndus, had as high a standard of civilization; and its homelands remainedunconquered and fairly prosperous for over two hundred years. Its predecessor,the Median Empire, had endured for half a century. After a brief submergence byAlexander the Great, it rose again as the Seleucid Empire, which endured forsome centuries. The Seleucid dominion shrank at last to the west of theEuphrates, and became a part of the Roman Empire; but Persia, revived by theParthians as a new Persian Empire, first under the Arsacids and then under theSassanids, outlived the empire of Rome. The Sassanids repeatedly carried warinto the Byzantine Empire, and held the line of the Euphrates steadfastly. In616 AD under Chosroes II, they were holding Damascus, Jerusalem, and Egypt, andthreatening the Hellespont. But there has been no tradition to keep alive theglories of the Sassanids. The reputation of Rome has flourished through theprosperity of her heirs. The tradition of Rome is greater than its reality.History distinguishes two chief groups of Roman emperors who were greatadministrators. The first of these groups began with:Augustus Cæsar (27 BC to 14 AD), the Octavian of the previous section, whoworked hard at the reorganization of the provincial governments and at financialreform. He established a certain tradition of lawfulness and honesty in thebureaucracy, and he restrained the more monstrous corruptions and tyrannies bygiving the provincial citizen the right to appeal to Cæsar. But he fixed theEuropean boundaries of the empire along the Rhine and Danube, so leavingGermany, which is the necessary backbone of a safe and prosperous Europe, tobarbarism; and he made a similar limitation in the east at the Euphrates,leaving Armenia independent, to be a constant bone of contention with theArsacids and Sassanids. It is doubtful whether he considered that he was fixingthe final boundaries of the empire along these lines, or whether he thought itdesirable to consolidate for some years before any further attempts atexpansion.Tiberius (14 to 37 AD) is also described as a capable ruler, but he becameintensely unpopular in Rome, and it would seem that he was addicted to gross andabominable vices. But his indulgence in these and his personal tyrannies andcruelties did not interfere with the general prosperity of the empire. It isdifficult to judge him; nearly all our sources of information are manifestlyhostile to him.Caligula (37 to 41 AD) was insane, but the empire carried on during four yearsof eccentricity at its head. Finally he was murdered in his palace by hisservants, and there seems to have been an attempt to restore the senatorialgovernment, an attempt which was promptly suppressed by the household legions.Claudius (41 to 54 AD), the uncle of Caligula, upon whom the choice of thesoldiers fell, was personally uncouth, but he seems to have been a hardworkingand fairly capable administrator. He advanced the westward boundary of theempire by annexing the southern half of Britain. He was poisoned by Agrippina,the mother of his adopted son, Nero, and a woman of great charm and force ofcharacter.Nero (54 to 68 AD), like Tiberius, is credited with monstrous vices andcruelties, but the empire had acquired sufficient momentum to carry on throughhis fourteen years of power. He certainly murdered his devoted but troublesomemother and his wife, the latter as a mark of devotion to a lady, Poppæa, whothen married him; but the domestic infelicities of the Cæsars are no part of ourpresent story. The reader greedy for criminal particulars must go to theclassical source, Suetonius. These various Cæsars and their successors and theirwomenkind were probably no worse essentially than most weak and passionate humanbeings, but they had no real religion, being themselves gods; they had no wideknowledge on which to build high ambitions, their women were fierce and oftenilliterate, and they were under no restraints of law or custom. They weresurrounded by creatures ready to stimulate their slightest wishes and totranslate their vaguest impulses into action. What are mere passing blackthoughts and angry impulses with most of us became therefore deeds with them.Before a man condemns Nero as a different species of being from himself, heshould examine his own secret thoughts very carefully. Nero became intenselyunpopular in Rome, and it is interesting to note that he became unpopular notbecause he murdered and poisoned his intimate relations, but because there wasan insurrection in Britain under a certain Queen Boadicea, and the Roman forcessuffered a great disaster (61 AD), and because there was a destructiveearthquake in Southern Italy. The Roman population, true to its Etruscan streak,never religious and always superstitious, did not mind a wicked Cæsar, but itdid object strongly to an unpropitious one. The Spanish legions rose ininsurrection under an elderly general of seventy-three, Galba, whom theyacclaimed emperor. He advanced upon Rome carried in a litter. Nero, hopeless ofsupport, committed suicide (68 AD).Galba, however, was only one of a group of would-be emperors. The generals incommand of the Rhine legions, the Palatine troops, and the eastern armies, eachattempted to seize power. Rome saw four emperors in a year, Galba, Otho,Vitellus, and Vespasian; the fourth, Vespasian (69-79 AD), from the easterncommand, had the firmest grip, and held and kept the prize. But with Nero theline of Cæsars born or adopted ended. Cæsar ceased to be the family name of theRoman emperors and became a title, Divus Cæsar, the Cæsar god. The monarchy tooka step forward towards orientalism by an increased insistence upon the worshipof the ruler.165 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_165_r1.gif]Vespasian (69 to 79 AD) and his sons Titus (79 AD) and Domitian (81 AD)constitute, as it were, a second dynasty, the Flavian; then after theassassination of Domitian came a group of emperors related to one another not byblood, but by adoption, the adoptive emperors. Nerva (96 AD) was the first ofthis line, and Trajan (98 AD) the second. They were followed by theindefatigable Hadrian (117 AD), Antoninus Pius (138 AD), and Marcus Aurelius(161 to 180 AD). Under both the Flavians and the Antonines the boundaries of theempire crept forward again. North Britain was annexed in 84 AD, the angle of theRhine and Danube was filled in, and what is now Transylvania was made into a newprovince, Dacia. Trajan also invaded Parthia and annexed Armenia, Assyria, andMesopotamia. Under his rule the empire reached its maximum extent. Hadrian, hissuccessor, was of a cautious and retractile disposition. He abandoned these neweastern conquests of Trajan’s, and he also abandoned North Britain. He adoptedthe Chinese idea of the limiting wall against barbarism, an excellent idea solong as the pressure of population on the imperial side of the wall is greaterthan the pressure from without, but worthless otherwise. He built Hadrian’s wallacross Britain, and a palisade between the Rhine and the Danube. The full tideof Roman expansion was past, and in the reign of his successor the NorthEuropean frontier was already actively on the defensive against the aggressionof Teutonic and Slavic tribes.Marcus Aurelius Antoninus is one of those figures in history about which mendiffer widely and intensely. To some critics he seems to have been a priggishperson; he dabbled in religions, and took a pleasure in conducting priestlyceremonies in priestly garments—a disposition offensive to common men—and theyresent his alleged failure to restrain the wickedness of his wife Faustina. Thestories of his domestic infelicity, however, rest on no very good foundations,though certainly his son Commodus was a startling person for a good home toproduce. On the other hand, he was unquestionably a devoted and industriousemperor, holding social order together through a series of disastrous years ofvile weather, great floods, failing harvests and famine, barbaric raids andrevolts, and at last a terrible universal pestilence. Says F. W. Farrar, quotedin the Encyclopædia Britannica,He regarded himself as being, in fact, the servant of all. The registry of thecitizens, the suppression of litigation, the elevation of public morals, thecare of minors, the retrenchment of public expenses, the limitation ofgladiatorial games and shows, the care of roads, the restoration of senatorialprivileges, the appointment of none but worthy magistrates, even the regulationof street traffic, these and numberless other duties so completely absorbed hisattention that, in spite of indifferent health, they often kept him at severelabour from early morning till long after midnight. His position, indeed, oftennecessitated his presence at games and shows; but on these occasions he occupiedhimself either in reading, or being read to, or in writing notes. He was one ofthose who held that nothing should be done hastily, and that few crimes wereworse than waste of time.But it is not by these industries that he is now remembered. He was one of thegreatest exponents of the Stoical philosophy, and in his Meditations, jotteddown in camp and court, he has put so much of a human soul on record as to raiseup for himself in each generation a fresh series of friends and admirers.With the death of Marcus Aurelius this phase of unity and comparatively goodgovernment came to an end, and his son Commodus inaugurated an age of disorder.Practically the empire had been at peace within itself for two hundred years.Now for a hundred years the student of Roman history must master the variouscriminology of a number of inadequate emperors, while the frontier crumbled andreceded under barbarian pressure. One or two names only seem to be the names ofable men: such were Septimius Severus, Aurelian, and Probus. Septimius Severuswas a Carthaginian, and his sister was never able to master Latin. She conductedher Roman household in the Punic language, which must have made Cato the elderturn in his grave. The rest of the emperors of this period were chieflyadventurers too unimportant to the general scheme of things for us to note. Attimes there were separate emperors ruling in different parts of the distractedempire. From our present point of view the Emperor Decius, who was defeated andkilled during a great raid of the Goths into Thrace in 251 AD, and the EmperorValerian, who, together with the great city of Antioch, was captured by theSassanid Shah of Persia in 260 AD, are worthy of notice because they mark theinsecurity of the whole Roman system, and the character of the outer pressureupon it. So, too, is Claudius, “the Conqueror of the Goths,” because he gained agreat victory over these people at Nish in Serbia (270 AD), and because he died,like Pericles, of the plague.Through all these centuries intermittent pestilences were playing a part inweakening races and altering social conditions, a part that has still to beproperly worked out by historians. There was, for instance, a great plaguethroughout the empire between the years 164 and 180 AD in the reign of theEmperor Marcus Aurelius. It probably did much to disorganize social life andprepare the way for the troubles that followed the accession of Commodus. Thissame pestilence devastated China, as we shall note in § 4 of this chapter.Considerable fluctuations of climate had also been going on in the first andsecond centuries, producing stresses and shiftings of population, whose forcehistorians have still to appraise. But before we go on to tell of the irruptionsof the barbarians and the attempts of such later emperors as Diocletian (284 AD)and Constantine the Great (312 AD) to hold together the heaving and splittingvessel of the state, we must describe something of the conditions of human lifein the Roman Empire during its two centuries of prosperity.§ 2The impatient reader of history may be disposed to count the two centuries oforder between 27 BC and 180 AD as among the wasted opportunities of mankind. Itwas an age of spending rather than of creation, an age of architecture and tradein which the rich grew richer and the poor poorer and the soul and spirit of mandecayed. Looked at superficially, as a man might have looked at it from anaeroplane a couple of thousand feet in the air, there was a considerableflourish of prosperity. Everywhere, from York to Cyrene and from Lisbon toAntioch, he would have noted large and well-built cities, with temples,theatres, amphitheatres, markets, and the like; thousands of such cities,supplied by great aqueducts and served by splendid high roads, whose statelyremains astonish us to this day. He would have noted an abundant cultivation,and have soared too high to discover that this cultivation was the grudging workof slaves. Upon the Mediterranean and the Red Sea a considerable traffic wouldbe visible; and the sight of two ships alongside each other would not at thataltitude reveal the fact that one was a pirate and plundering the other.And even if the observer came down to a closer scrutiny, there would still bemuch accumulated improvement to note. There had been a softening of manners anda general refinement since the days of Julius Cæsar. With this there had been areal increase of humane feeling. During the period of the Antonines, laws forthe protection of slaves from extreme cruelty came into existence, and it was nolonger permissible to sell them to the gladiatorial schools. Not only were thecities outwardly more splendidly built, but within the homes of the wealthythere had been great advances in the art of decoration. The gross feasting,animal indulgence, and vulgar display of the earlier days of Roman prosperitywere now tempered by a certain refinement. Dress had become richer, finer, andmore beautiful. There was a great trade in silk with remote China, for themulberry tree and the silkworm had not yet begun to move west. By the time silkhad ended its long and varied journey to Rome it was worth its weight in gold.Yet it was used abundantly, and there was a steady flow of the precious metalseastward in exchange. There had been very considerable advances in gastronomyand the arts of entertainment. Petronius describes a feast given by a wealthyman under the early Cæsars, a remarkable succession of courses, some delicious,some amazing, exceeding anything that even the splendours and imagination ofmodern New York could produce; and the festival was varied by music and bydisplays of tightrope dancing, juggling, Homeric recitations, and the like.There was a considerable amount of what we may describe as “rich men’s culture”throughout the empire. Books were far more plentiful than they had been beforethe time of the Cæsars. Men prided themselves upon their libraries, even whenthe cares and responsibilities of property made them too busy to give theirliterary treasures much more than a passing examination. The knowledge of Greekspread eastward and of Latin westward, and if the prominent men of this or thatBritish or Gallic city lacked any profound Greek culture themselves, they couldalways turn to some slave or other, whose learning had been guaranteed of thehighest quality by the slave-dealer, to supply the deficiency.The generation of Cato had despised Greeks and the Greek language, but now allthat was changed. The prestige of Greek learning of an approved and settled typewas as high in the Rome of Antoninus Pius as it was in the Oxford and Cambridgeof Victorian England. The Greek scholar received the same mixture ofunintelligent deference and practical contempt. There was a very considerableamount of Greek scholarship, and of written criticism and commentary. Indeedthere was so great an admiration for Greek letters as almost completely todestroy the Greek spirit; and the recorded observations of Aristotle were valuedso highly as to preclude any attempt to imitate his organization of furtherinquiry. It is noteworthy that while Aristotle in the original Greek fell likeseed upon stony soil in the Roman world, he was, in Syrian and Arabictranslations, immensely stimulating to the Arabic civilization of a thousandyears later. Nor were the æsthetic claims of Latin neglected in this heyday ofGreek erudition. As Greece had her epics and so forth, the Romans felt thatthey, too, must have their epics. The age of Augustus was an age of imitativeliterature. Virgil in the Æneid set himself modestly but resolutely, and with anelegant sort of successfulness, to parallel the Odyssey and Iliad.All this widespread culture of the wealthy householder is to the credit of theearly Roman Empire, and Gibbon makes the most of it in the sunny review of theage of the Antonines with which he opens his Decline and Fall of the RomanEmpire. His design for that great work demanded a prelude of splendour andtranquillity. But he was far too shrewd and subtle not to qualify his apparentapproval of the conditions he describes. “Under the Roman Empire,” he writes,. . . the labour of an industrious and ingenious people was variously butincessantly employed in the service of the rich. In their dress, their table,their houses, and their furniture, the favourites of fortune united everyrefinement of convenience, of elegance, and of splendour, whatever could soothetheir pride, or gratify their sensuality. Such refinements, under the odiousname of luxury, have been severely arraigned by the moralists of every age; andit might perhaps be more conducive to the virtue, as well as happiness, ofmankind, if all possessed the necessaries, and none the superfluities of life.But in the present imperfect condition of society, luxury, though it may proceedfrom vice or folly, seems to be the only means that can correct the unequaldistribution of property. The diligent mechanic and the skilful artist, who haveobtained no share in the division of the earth, receive a voluntary tax from thepossessors of land; and the latter are prompted, by a sense of interest, toimprove those estates, with whose produce they may purchase additional pleasure.This operation, the particular effects of which are felt in every society, actedwith much more diffuse energy in the Roman world. The provinces would soon havebeen exhausted of their wealth, if the manufactures and commerce of luxury hadnot insensibly restored to the industrious subjects the sums which were exactedfrom them by the arms and authority of Rome.And so on, with a sting of satire in every fold of the florid description.If we look a little more widely than a hovering aeroplane can do at the movementof races upon the earth, or a little more closely than an inspection of streets,amphitheatres, and banquets goes, into the souls and thoughts of men, we shallfind that this impressive display of material prosperity is merely the shininggarment of a polity blind to things without and things within, and blind to thefuture. If, for instance, we compare the two centuries of Roman ascendancy andopportunity, the first and second centuries AD, with the two centuries of Greekand Hellenic life beginning about 466 BC with the supremacy of Pericles inAthens, we are amazed by—we cannot call it an inferiority, it is a completeabsence of science. The incuriousness of the Roman rich and the Roman rulers wasmore massive and monumental even than their architecture.In one field of knowledge particularly we might have expected the Romans to havebeen alert and enterprising, and that was geography. Their political interestsdemanded a steadfast inquiry into the state of affairs beyond their frontiers,and yet that inquiry was never made. There is practically no literature of Romantravel beyond the imperial limits, no such keen and curious accounts asHerodotus gives of the Scythians, the Africans, and the like. There is nothingin Latin to compare with the early descriptions of India and Siberia that are tobe found in Chinese. The Roman legions went at one time into Scotland, yet thereremains no really intelligent account of Picts or Scots, much less any glance atthe seas beyond. Such explorations as those of Hanno or Pharaoh Necho seem tohave been altogether beyond the scope of the Roman imagination. It is probablethat after the destruction of Carthage the amount of shipping that went out intothe Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar fell to inconsiderableproportions. Still more impossible in this world of vulgar wealth, enslavedintelligence, and bureaucratic rule was any further development of the astronomyand physiography of Alexandria. The Romans do not seem even to have inquiredwhat manner of men wove the silk and prepared the spices or collected the amberand the pearls that came into their markets. Yet the channels of inquiry wereopen and easy; pathways led in every direction to the most convenient“jumping-off places” for explorers it is possible to imagine.The most remote countries of the ancient world were ransacked to supply the pompand delicacy of Rome. The forests of Scythia afforded some valuable furs. Amberwas brought overland from the shores of the Baltic to the Danube, and thebarbarians were astonished at the price which they received in exchange for souseless a commodity. There was a considerable demand for Babylonian carpets andother manufactures of the East; but the most important branch of foreign tradewas carried on with Arabia and India. Every year, about the time of the summersolstice, a fleet of a hundred and twenty vessels sailed from Myos-hormos, aport of Egypt on the Red Sea. By the periodical assistance of the monsoons, theytraversed the ocean in about forty days. The coast of Malabar, or the island ofCeylon, was the usual term of their navigation, and it was in those markets thatthe merchants from the more remote countries of Asia expected their arrival. Thereturn of the fleet to Egypt was fixed to the months of December or January, andas soon as their rich cargo had been transported, on the backs of camels, fromthe Red Sea to the Nile, and had descended that river as far as it was poured,without delay, into the capital of the empire.1[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en118]Yet Rome was content to feast, exact, grow rich, and watch its gladiatorialshows without the slightest attempt to learn anything of India, China, Persia orScythia, Buddha or Zoroaster, or about the Huns, the Negroes, the people ofScandinavia, or the secrets of the western sea.When we realize the uninspiring quality of the social atmosphere which made thisindifference possible, we are able to account for the failure of Rome during itsage of opportunity to develop any physical or chemical science, and as aconsequence to gain any increased control over matter. Most of the physicians inRome were Greeks and many of them slaves—for the Roman wealthy did not evenunderstand that a bought mind is a spoilt mind. Yet this was not due to any wantof natural genius among the Roman people; it was due entirely to their socialand economic conditions. From the Middle Ages to the present day Italy hasproduced a great number of brilliant scientific men. And one of the most shrewdand inspired of scientific writers was an Italian, Lucretius, who lived betweenthe time of Marius and Julius Cæsar (about 100 BC to about 55 BC). This amazingman was of the quality of Leonardo da Vinci (also an Italian) or Newton. Hewrote a long Latin poem about the processes of Nature, De Rerum Naturia, inwhich he guessed with astonishing insight about the constitution of matter andabout the early history of mankind. Osborn in his Old Stone Age quotes withadmiration long passages from Lucretius about primitive man, so good and trueare they today. But this was an individual display, a seed that bore no fruit.Roman science was still-born into a suffocating atmosphere of vile wealth andmilitary oppression. The true figure to represent the classical Roman attitudeto science is not Lucretius, but that Roman soldier who hacked Archimedes todeath at the storming of Syracuse.And if physical and biological science wilted and died on the stony soil ofRoman prosperity, political and social science never had a chance to germinate.Political discussion would have been treason to the emperor, social or economicinquiry would have threatened the rich. So Rome, until disaster fell upon her,never examined into her own social health, never questioned the ultimate valueof her hard officialism. Consequently, there was no one who realized the gravityof her failure to develop any intellectual imagination to hold her empiretogether, any general education in common ideas that would make men fight andwork for the empire as men will fight and work for a dear possession. But therulers of the Roman Empire did not want their citizens to fight for anything inany spirit at all. The rich had eaten the heart out of their general population,and they were content with the meal they had made. The legions were filled withGermans, Britons, Numidians, and the like; and until the very end the wealthyRomans thought they could go on buying barbarians to defend them against theenemy without and the rebel poor within. How little was done in education by theRomans is shown by an account of what was done. Says Mr. H. Stuart Jones,Julius Cæsar bestowed Roman citizenship on “teachers of the liberal arts”;Vespasian endowed professorships of Greek and Latin oratory at Rome; and lateremperors, especially Antoninus Pius, extended the same benefits to theprovinces. Local enterprise and munificence were also devoted to the cause ofeducation; we learn from the correspondence of the younger Pliny that publicschools were founded in the towns of Northern Italy. But though there was a widediffusion of knowledge under the empire, there was no true intellectualprogress. Augustus, it is true, gathered about him the most brilliant writers ofhis time, and the debut of the new monarchy coincided with the Golden Age ofRoman literature; but this was of brief duration, and the beginnings of theChristian era saw the triumph of classicism and the first steps in the declinewhich awaits all literary movements which look to the past rather than thefuture.There is a diagnosis of the intellectual decadence of the age in a treatise uponthe sublime by a Greek writer who wrote somewhen in the second, third, or fourthcentury AD, and who may possibly have been Longinus Philologus, which statesvery distinctly one manifest factor in the mental sickness of the Roman world.He is cited by Gibbon:The sublime Longinus, who, in somewhat a later period and in the court of aSyrian queen, Zenobia, preserved the spirit of ancient Athens, observes andlaments the degeneracy of his contemporaries, which debased their sentiments,enervated their courage, and depressed their talents. “In the same manner,” sayshe, “as some children always remain pigmies, whose infant limbs have been tooclosely confined, thus our tender minds, fettered by the prejudices and habitsof a just servitude, are unable to expand themselves or to attain thatwell-proportioned greatness which we admire in the ancients, who, living under apopular government, wrote with all the same freedom as they acted.”But this critic grasped only one aspect of the restraints upon mental activity.The leading-strings that kept the Roman mind in a permanent state of infantilismconstituted a double servitude; they were economic as well as political. Theaccount Gibbon gives of the life and activities of a certain Herodes Atticus,who lived in the time of Hadrian, shows just how little was the share of theordinary citizen in the outward magnificence of the time. This Atticus had animmense fortune, and he amused himself by huge architectural benefactions tovarious cities. Athens was given a racecourse, and a theatre of cedar, curiouslycarved, was set up there to the memory of his wife; a theatre was built atCorinth, a racecourse was given to Delphi, baths to Thermopylæ, an aqueduct toCanusium, and so on and so on. One is struck by the spectacle of a world ofslaves and common people who were not consulted and over whose heads, withoutany participation on their part, this rich man indulged in his displays of“taste.” Numerous inscriptions in Greece and Asia still preserve the name ofHerodes Atticus, “patron and benefactor,” who ranged about the empire as thoughit was his private garden, commemorating himself by these embellishments. He didnot confine himself to splendid buildings. He was also a philosopher, thoughnone of his wisdom has survived. He had a large villa near Athens, and therephilosophers were welcome guests so long as they convinced their patron of thesoundness of their pretensions, received his discourses with respect, and didnot offend him by insolent controversy.The world, it is evident, was not progressing during these two centuries ofRoman prosperity. But was it happy in its stagnation? There are signs of a veryunmistakable sort that the great mass of human beings in the empire, a massnumbering something between a hundred and a hundred and fifty millions, was nothappy, was probably very acutely miserable, beneath its outward magnificence.True there were no great wars and conquests within the empire, little of famineor fire or sword to afflict mankind; but, on the other hand, there was aterrible restraint by government, and still more by the property of the rich,upon the free activities of nearly everyone. Life for the great majority whowere neither rich nor official, nor the womankind and the parasites of the richand official, must have been laborious, tedious, and lacking in interest andfreedom to a degree that a modern mind can scarcely imagine.Three things in particular may be cited to sustain the opinion that this periodwas a period of widespread unhappiness. The first of these is the extraordinaryapathy of the population to political events. They saw one upstart pretender toempire succeed another with complete indifference. Such things did not seem tomatter to them; hope had gone. When presently the barbarians poured into theempire, there was nothing but the legions to face them. There was no popularuprising against them at all. Everywhere the barbarians must have beenoutnumbered if only the people had resisted. But the people did not resist. Itis manifest that to the bulk of its inhabitants the Roman Empire did not seem tobe a thing worth fighting for. To the slaves and common people the barbarianprobably seemed to promise more freedom and less indignity than the pompous ruleof the imperial official and grinding employment by the rich. The looting andburning of palaces and an occasional massacre did not shock the folk of theRoman underworld as it shocked the wealthy and cultured people to whom we owesuch accounts as we have of the breaking down of the imperial system. Greatnumbers of slaves and common people probably joined the barbarians, who knewlittle of racial or patriotic prejudices, and were openhanded to any promisingrecruit. No doubt in many cases the population found that the barbarian was aworse infliction even than the tax-gatherer and the slave-driver. But thatdiscovery came too late for resistance or the restoration of the old order.And as a second symptom that points to the same conclusion that life was hardlyworth living for the poor and the slaves and the majority of people during theage of the Antonines, we must reckon the steady depopulation of the empire.People refused to have children. They did so, we suggest, because their homeswere not safe from oppression, because in the case of slaves there was nosecurity that the husband and wife would not be separated, because there was nopride nor reasonable hope in children anymore. In modern states the greatbreeding-ground has always been the agricultural countryside where there is amore or less secure peasantry; but under the Roman Empire the peasant and thesmall cultivator was either a worried debtor, or he was held in a network ofrestraints that made him a spiritless serf, or he had been ousted altogether bythe gang production of slaves.A third indication that this outwardly flourishing period was one of deepunhappiness and mental distress for vast multitudes, is to be found in thespread of new religious movements throughout the population. We have seen how inthe case of the little country of Judea a whole nation may be infected by thepersuasion that life is unsatisfactory and wrong, and that something is neededto set it right. The mind of the Jews, as we know, had crystallized about theidea of the Promise of the One True God and the coming of a Saviour or Messiah.Rather different ideas from these were spreading through the Roman Empire. Theywere but varying answers to one universal question: “What must we do forsalvation?” A frequent and natural consequence of disgust with life as it is, isto throw the imagination forward to an after-life, which is to redeem all themiseries and injustices of this one. The belief in such compensation is a greatopiate for present miseries. Egyptian religion had long been saturated withanticipations of immortality, and we have seen how central was that idea to thecult of Serapis and Isis at Alexandria. The ancient mysteries of Demeter andOrpheus, the mysteries of the Mediterranean race, revived and made a sort oftheocrasia with these new cults.A second great religious movement was Mithraism, a development ofZoroastrianism, a religion of very ancient Aryan origin, traceable back to theIndo-Iranian people before they split into Persians and Hindus. We cannot hereexamine its mysteries in any detail.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en119]Mithras was a god of light, a Sun of Righteousness, and in the shrines of thecult he was always represented as slaying a sacred bull whose blood was the seedof life. Suffice it that, complicated with many added ingredients, this worshipof Mithras came into the Roman Empire about the time of Pompey the Great, andbegan to spread very widely under the Cæsars and Antonines. Like the Isisreligion, it promised immortality. Its followers were mainly slaves, soldiers,and distressed people. In its methods of worship, in the burning of candlesbefore the altar and so forth, it had a certain superficial resemblance to thelater developments of the ritual of the third great religious movement in theRoman world, Christianity.Christianity also was a doctrine of immortality and salvation, and it, too,spread at first chiefly among the lowly and unhappy. Christianity has beendenounced by modern writers as a “slave religion.” It was. It took the slavesand the downtrodden, and it gave them hope and restored their self-respect, sothat they stood up for righteousness like men and faced persecution and torment.But of the origins and quality of Christianity we will tell more fully in alater chapter.§ 3We have already shown reason for our statement that the Roman imperial systemwas a very unsound political growth indeed. It is absurd to write of itsstatecraft; it had none. At its best it had a bureaucratic administration whichkept the peace of the world for a time and failed altogether to secure it.Let us note here the main factors in its failure.The clue to all its failure lies in the absence of any free mental activity andany organization for the increase, development, and application of knowledge. Itrespected wealth and it despised science. It gave government to the rich, andimagined that wise men could be bought and bargained for in the slave marketswhen they were needed. It was, therefore, a colossally ignorant andunimaginative empire. It foresaw nothing.It had no strategic foresight, because it was blankly ignorant of geography andethnology. It knew nothing of the conditions of Russia, Central Asia, and theEast. It was content to keep the Rhine and Danube as its boundaries, and to makeno effort to Romanize Germany. But we need only look at the map of Europe andAsia showing the Roman Empire to see that a willing and incorporated Germany wasabsolutely essential to the life and security of Western Europe. Excluded,Germany became a wedge that needed only the impact of the Hunnish hammer tosplit up the whole system.Moreover, this neglect to push the boundaries northward to the Baltic left thatsea and the North Sea as a region of experiment and training and instruction inseamanship for the Northmen of Scandinavia, Denmark, and the Frisian coast. ButRome went on its way quite stupidly, oblivious to the growth of a newer and morepowerful piracy in the north.The same unimaginative quality made the Romans leave the seaways of theMediterranean undeveloped. When presently the barbarians pressed down to thewarm water, we read of no swift transport of armies from Spain or Africa or Asiato the rescue of Italy and the Adriatic coasts. Instead, we see the Vandalsbecoming masters of the western Mediterranean without so much as a naval battle.The Romans had been held at the Euphrates by an array of mounted archers. It wasclear that as the legion was organized it was useless in wide open country, andit should have been equally clear that sooner or later the mounted nomads ofeast Germany, south Russia or Parthia were bound to try conclusions with theempire. But the Romans, two hundred years after Cæsar’s time, were stillmarching about, the same drilled and clanking cohorts they had always been,easily ridden round and shot to pieces. The empire had learnt nothing even fromCarrhæ.The incapacity of the Roman imperialism for novelty in methods of transportagain is amazing. It was patent that their power and unity depended upon theswift movement of troops and supplies from one part of the empire to another.The republic made magnificent roads; the empire never improved upon them. Fourhundred years before the Antonines, Hero of Alexandria had made the firststeam-engine. Beautiful records of such beginnings of science were among theneglected treasures of the rich men’s libraries throughout the imperial domains.They were seed lying on stony ground. The armies and couriers of Marcus Aureliusdrudged along the roads exactly as the armies of Scipio Africanus had done threecenturies before them.The Roman writers were always lamenting the effeminacy of the age. It was theirfavourite cant. They recognized that the free men of the forest and steppes anddesert were harder and more desperate fighters than their citizens, but thenatural corollary of developing the industrial power of their accumulations ofpopulation to make a countervailing equipment never entered their heads. Insteadthey took the barbarians into their legions, taught them the arts of war,marched them about the empire, and returned them, with their lesson well learnt,to their own people.In view of these obvious negligences, it is no wonder that the Romansdisregarded that more subtle thing, the soul of the empire, altogether, and madeno effort to teach or train or win its common people into any consciousparticipation with its life. Such teaching or training would indeed have runcounter to all the ideas of the rich men and the imperial officials. They hadmade a tool of religion; science, literature, and education they had entrustedto the care of slaves, who were bred and trained and sold like dogs or horses;ignorant, pompous, and base, the Roman adventurers of finance and property whocreated the empire, lorded it with a sense of the utmost security while theirdestruction gathered without the empire and within.By the second and third centuries AD the overtaxed and overstrained imperialmachine was already staggering towards its downfall.§ 4And now it is necessary, if we are to understand clearly the true situation ofthe Roman Empire, to turn our eyes to the world beyond its northern and easternborders, the world of the plains, that stretches, with scarcely a break, fromHolland across Germany and Russia to the mountains of Central Asia and Mongolia,and to give a little attention to the parallel empire in China that was nowconsolidating and developing a far tougher and more enduring moral andintellectual unity than the Romans ever achieved.“It is the practice,” says Mr. E. H. Parker,. . . even amongst our most highly educated men in Europe, to deliver sonoroussentences about being “masters of the world,” “bringing all nations of the earthunder her sway,” and so on, when in reality only some corner of theMediterranean is involved, or some ephemeral sally into Persia and Gaul. Cyrusand Alexander, Darius and Xerxes, Cæsar and Pompey, all made very interestingexcursions, but they were certainly not on a larger scale or charged withgreater human interest than the campaigns which were going on at the other endof Asia. Western civilization possessed much in art and science for which Chinanever cared, but, on the other hand, the Chinese developed a historical andcritical literature, a courtesy of demeanour, a luxury of clothing, and anadministrative system of which Europe might have been proud. In one word, thehistory of the Far East is quite as interesting as that of the Far West. It onlyrequires to be able to read it. When we brash away contemptuously from ournotice the tremendous events which took place on the plains of Tartary, we mustnot blame the Chinese too much for declining to interest themselves in thedoings of what to them appear insignificant states dotted round theMediterranean and Caspian, which, at this time, was practically all the world ofwhich we knew in Europe.3 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en120]We have already mentioned (in Chap. XIV and elsewhere) the name of Shi Hwang-ti,who consolidated an empire much smaller, indeed, than the present limits ofChina, but still very great and populous, spreading from the valleys of theHwang-ho and the Yang-tse. He became king of Ch’in in 246 BC and emperor in 220BC, and he reigned until 210 BC, and during this third of a century he effectedmuch the same work of consolidation that Augustus Cæsar carried out in Rome twocenturies later. At his death there was dynastic trouble for four years, andthen (206 BC) a fresh dynasty, the Han, established itself and ruled for twohundred and twenty-nine years. The opening quarter century of the Christian erawas troubled by a usurper; then what is called the Later Han Dynasty recoveredpower and ruled for another century and a half until China, in the time of theAntonines, was so devastated by an eleven-year pestilence as to fall intodisorder. This same pestilence, we may note, also helped to produce a century ofconfusion in the Western world (see § 1). But altogether until this happened,for more than four hundred years Central China was generally at peace, and onthe whole well governed, a cycle of strength and prosperity unparalleled byanything in the experience of the Western world.Only the first of the Han monarchs continued the policy of Shi Hwang-ti againstthe literati. His successor restored the classics, for the old separatisttradition was broken, and in the uniformity of learning throughout the empirelay, he saw, the cement of Chinese unity. While the Roman world was still blindto the need of any universal mental organization, the Han emperors were settingup a uniform system of education and of literary degrees throughout China thathas maintained the intellectual solidarity of that great and always expandingcountry into modern times. The bureaucrats of Rome were of the mostmiscellaneous origins and traditions; the bureaucrats of China were, and arestill, made in the same mould, all members of one tradition. Since the Han daysChina has experienced great vicissitudes of political fortune, but they havenever changed her fundamental character; she has been divided, but she hasalways recovered her unity; she has been conquered, and she has always absorbedand assimilated her conquerors.166 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_166_r1.gif]But from our present point of view, the most important consequences of thisconsolidation of China under Shi Hwang-ti and the Hans was in its reaction uponthe unsettled tribes of the northern and western border of China. Throughout thedisordered centuries before the time of Shi Hwang-ti, the Hiung-nu or Huns hadoccupied Mongolia and large portions of Northern China, and had raided freelyinto China and interfered freely in Chinese politics. The new power andorganization of the Chinese civilization began to change this state of affairsfor good and all.We have already, in our first account of Chinese beginnings, noted the existenceof these Huns. It is necessary now to explain briefly who and what they were.Even in using this word Hun as a general equivalent for the Hiung-nu, we step onto controversial ground. In our accounts of the development of the Western worldwe have had occasion to name the Scythians, and to explain the difficulty ofdistinguishing clearly between Cimmerians, Sarmatians, Medes, Persians,Parthians, Goths, and other more or less nomadic, more or less Aryan peoples whodrifted to and fro in a great arc between the Danube and Central Asia. Whilesections of the Aryans were moving south and acquiring and developingcivilization, these other Aryan peoples were developing mobility and nomadism;they were learning the life of the tent, the wagon, and the herd. They werelearning also to use milk as a food basis, and were probably becoming lessagricultural, less disposed to take even snatch crops, than they had been. Theirdevelopment was being aided by a slow change in climate that was replacing theswamps and forests and park-lands of South Russia and Central Asia by steppes,by wide grazing lands that is, which favoured a healthy, unsettled life, andnecessitated an annual movement between summer and winter pasture. These peopleshad only the lowest political forms; they split up, they mingled together; thevarious races had identical social habits; and so it is that the difficulty, theimpossibility of sharp distinctions between them arises. Now the case of theMongolian races to the north and northwest of the Chinese civilization is veryparallel. There can be little doubt that the Hiung-nu, the Huns, and the laterpeople called the Mongols, were all very much the same people, and that theTurks and Tartars presently branched off from this same drifting Mongolianpopulation. Kalmucks and Buriats are later developments of the same strain. Herewe shall favour the use of the word “Hun” as a sort of general term for thesetribes, just as we have been free and wide in our use of “Scythian” in the West.The consolidation of China was a very serious matter for these Hunnish peoples.Hitherto their overflow of population had gone adventuring southward into thedisorders of divided China as water goes into a sponge. Now they found a wallbuilt against them, a firm government, and disciplined armies cutting them offfrom the grass plains. And though the wall held them back, it did not hold backthe Chinese. They were increasing and multiplying through these centuries ofpeace, and as they increased and multiplied, they spread steadily with house andplough wherever the soil permitted. They spread westward into Tibet andnorthward and northwestwardly, perhaps to the edge of the Gobi desert. Theyspread into the homes and pasturing and hunting-grounds of the Hunnish nomads,exactly as the white people of the United States spread westward into thehunting-grounds of the Red Indians. And in spite of raid and massacre, they werejust as invincible because they had the pressure of numbers and a strongavenging government behind them. Even without the latter support the cultivatingcivilization of China has enormous powers of permeation and extension. It hasspread slowly and continuously for three thousand years. It is spreading inManchuria and Siberia today. It roots deeply where it spreads.Partly the Huns were civilized and assimilated by the Chinese. The morenortherly Huns were checked and their superabundant energies were turnedwestward. The southern Huns were merged into the imperial population.If the reader will examine the map of Central Asia, he will see that very greatmountain barriers separate the Southern, Western, and Eastern peoples of Asia.(But he should be wary of forming his ideas from a map upon Mercator’sprojection, which enormously exaggerates the areas and distances of NorthernAsia and Siberia). He will find that from the central mountain masses threegreat mountain systems radiate eastward; the Himalayas going southeastward,south of Tibet, the Kuen Lun eastward, north of Tibet, and the Thien Shannortheastward to join the Altai mountains. Further to the north is the greatplain, still steadily thawing and drying. Between the Thien Shan and the KuenLun is an area, the Tarim Basin (== roughly Eastern Turkestan), of rivers thatnever reach the sea, but end in swamps and intermittent lakes. This basin wasmuch more fertile in the past than it is now. The mountain barrier to the westof this Tarim Basin is high, but not forbidding; there are many practicableroutes downward into Western Turkestan, and it is possible to travel eitheralong the northern foothills of the Kuen Lun or by the Tarim valley westwardfrom China to Kashgar (where the roads converge), and so over the mountains toKokand, Samarkand, and Bokhara. Here then is the natural meeting-place inhistory of Aryan and Mongolian. Here or round by the sea.We have already noted how Alexander the Great came to one side of the barrier in329 BC. High among the mountains of Turkestan a lake preserves his name. Indeed,so living is the tradition of his great raid, that almost any stone ruin inCentral Asia is still ascribed to “Iskander.” After this brief glimpse, thelight of history upon this region fades again, and when it becomes bright oncemore it is on the eastern and not upon the western side. Far away to the eastShi Hwang-ti had routed the Huns and walled them out of China proper. A portionof these people remained in the north of China, a remnant which was destined toamalgamate with Chinese life under the Hans, but a considerable section hadturned westward and (second and first centuries BC) driven before them a kindredpeople called the Yueh-Chi, driving them from the eastern to the westernextremity of the Kuen Lun, and at last right over the barrier into the onceAryan region of Western Turkestan.4 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en121]These Yueh-Chi conquered the slightly Hellenized kingdom of Bactria, and mixedwith Aryan people there. Later on these Yueh-Chi became, or were merged withAryan elements into, a people called the Indo-Scythians, who went on down theKhyber Pass and conquered northern portions of India as far as Benares (100-150AD), wiping out the last vestiges of Hellenic rule in India. This big splashover of the Mongolian races westward was probably not the first of suchsplashes, but it is the first recorded splash. In the rear of the Yueh-Chi werethe Huns, and in the rear of the Huns and turning them now northward was thevigorous Han Dynasty of China. In the reign of the greatest of the Han monarchs,Wu-Ti (140-86 BC), the Huns had been driven northward out of the whole ofEastern Turkestan or subjugated, the Tarim Basin swarmed with Chinese settlers,and caravans were going over westward with silk and lacquer and jade to tradefor the gold and silver of Armenia and Rome.The splash over of the Yueh-Chi is recorded, but it is fairly evident that muchwestward movement of sections of the Hunnish peoples is not recorded. From 200BC to 200 AD the Chinese Empire maintained a hard, resolute, advancing fronttowards nomadism, and the surplus of the nomads drifted steadily west. There wasno such settling down behind a final frontier on the part of the Chinese as wesee in the case of the Romans at the Rhine and Danube. The drift of the nomadsbefore this Chinese thrust, century by century, turned southward at firsttowards Bactria. The Parthians of the first century BC probably mingled Scythianand Mongolian elements. The “singing arrows” that destroyed the army of Crassuscame, it would seem, originally from the Altai and the Thien Shan. After thefirst century BC the line of greater attraction and least resistance lay for atime towards the north of the Caspian. In a century or so all the country knownas Western Turkestan was “Mongolized,” and so it remains to this day. A secondgreat thrust by China began about 75 AD, and accelerated the westward drift ofthe nomads. In 102, Pan Chau, a Chinese general, was sending explorers from hisadvanced camp upon the Caspian (or, as some authorities say, the Persian Gulf)to learn particulars of the Roman power. But their reports decided him not toproceed.By the first century AD nomadic Mongolian peoples were in evidence upon theeastern boundaries of Europe, already greatly mixed with Nordic nomads and withuprooted Nordic elements from the Caspian-Pamir region. There were Hunnishpeoples established between the Caspian Sea and the Urals. West of them were theAlans, probably also a Mongolian people with Nordic elements; they had foughtagainst Pompey the Great when he was in Armenia in 65 BC. These were as yet thefurthest westward peoples of the new Mongolian advance, and they made no furtherwestward push until the fourth century AD. To the northwest the Finns, aMongolian people, had long been established as far west as the Baltic.West of the Huns, beyond the Don, there were purely Nordic tribes, the Goths.These Goths had spread southeastward from their region of origin in Scandinavia.They were a Teutonic people, and we have already marked them crossing the Balticin the map we have given of the earlier distribution of the Aryan-speakingpeople. These Goths continued to move southeastward across Russia, using therivers and never forgetting their Baltic watercraft. No doubt they assimilatedmuch Scythian population as they spread down to the Black Sea. In the firstcentury AD they were in two main divisions, the Ostrogoths, the east Goths, whowere between the Don and the Dnieper, and the Visigoths, or west Goths, west ofthe Dnieper. During the first century there was quiescence over the greatplains, but population was accumulating and the tribes were fermenting. Thesecond and third centuries seem to have been a phase of comparatively moistseasons and abundant grass. Presently in the fourth and fifth centuries theweather grew drier and the grass became scanty and the nomads stirred afresh.But it is interesting to note that in the opening century of the Christian era,the Chinese Empire was strong enough to expel and push off from itself thesurplus of this Mongolian nomadism to the north of it which presently conqueredNorth India and gathered force and mingled with Aryan nomadism, and fell at lastlike an avalanche upon the weak-backed Roman Empire.Before we go on to tell of the blows that now began to fall upon the RomanEmpire and of the efforts of one or two great men to arrest the collapse, we maysay a few words about the habits and quality of these westward-drifting barbaricMongolian peoples who were now spreading from the limits of China towards theBlack and Baltic Seas. It is still the European custom to follow the lead of theRoman writers and write of these Huns and their associates as of somethingincredibly destructive and cruel. But such accounts as we have from the Romanswere written in periods of panic, and the Roman could lie about his enemies witha freedom and vigour that must arouse the envy even of the modern propagandist.He could talk of “Punic faith” as a byword for perfidy while committing the mostabominable treacheries against Carthage, and his railing accusations ofsystematic cruelty against this people or that were usually the prelude andexcuse for some frightful massacre or enslavement or robbery on his own part. Hehad quite a modern passion for self-justification. We must remember that theseaccounts of the savagery and frightfulness of the Huns came from a people whosechief amusement was gladiatorial shows, and whose chief method of dealing withinsurrection and sedition was nailing the offender to a cross to die. From firstto last the Roman Empire must have killed hundreds of thousands of men in thatway. A large portion of the population of this empire that could complain of thebarbarism of its assailants consisted of slaves subject practically to almostany lust or caprice at the hands of their owners. It is well to bear these factsin mind before we mourn the swamping of the Roman Empire by the barbarians asthough it was an extinction of all that is fine in life by all that is black andugly.167 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_167_r1.gif]The facts seem to be that the Hunnish peoples were the eastern equivalent of theprimitive Aryans, and that, in spite of their profound racial and linguisticdifferences, they mixed with the nomadic and semi-nomadic residuum of theAryan-speaking races north of the Danube and Persia very easily andsuccessfully. Instead of killing, they enlisted and intermarried with thepeoples they invaded. They had that necessary gift for all peoples destined topolitical predominance, tolerant assimilation. They came rather later in time,and their nomadic life was more highly developed than that of the primitiveAryans. The primitive Aryans were a forest and ox-wagon people who took to thehorse later. The Hunnish peoples had grown up with the horse. Somewhen about1,200 or 1,000 years BC they began to ride the horse. The bit, the saddle, thestirrup, these are not primitive things, but they are necessary if man and horseare to keep going for long stretches. It is well to bear in mind how modern athing is riding. Altogether man has not been in the saddle for much more thanthree thousand years.5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en122] We havealready noted the gradual appearance of the war-chariot, the mounted man, andfinally of disciplined cavalry in this history. It was from the Mongolianregions of Asia that these things came. To this day men in Central Asia gorather in the saddle than on their proper feet. Says Ratzel,6[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en123] “Strong, long-necked horses are foundin enormous numbers on the steppes. For Mongols and Turcomans riding is not aluxury; even the Mongol shepherds tend their flocks on horseback. Children aretaught to ride in early youth; and the boy of three years old often takes hisfirst riding-lesson on a safe child’s saddle and makes quick progress.”It is impossible to suppose that the Huns and the Alans could have differed verywidely in character from the present nomads of the steppe regions, and nearlyall observers are agreed in describing these latter as open and pleasant people.They are thoroughly honest and free-spirited. “The character of the herdsmen ofCentral Asia,” says Ratzel,7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en124] “whenunadulterated, is ponderous eloquence, frankness, rough good-nature, pride, butalso indolence, irritability, and a tendency to vindictiveness. Their faces showa considerable share of frankness combined with amusing naïveté. . . . Theircourage is rather a sudden blaze of pugnacity than cold boldness. Religiousfanaticism they have none. Hospitality is universal.” This is not an entirelydisagreeable picture. Their personal bearing, he says further, is quieter andmore dignified than that of the townsmen of Turkestan and Persia. Add to thisthat the nomadic life prevents any great class inequalities or any extensivedevelopment of slavery.Of course these peoples out of Asia were totally illiterate and artisticallyundeveloped. But we must not suppose, on that account, that they were primitivebarbarians, and that their state of life was at the level from which theagricultural civilization had long ago arisen. It was not. They, too, haddeveloped, but they had developed along a different line, a line with lessintellectual complication, more personal dignity perhaps, and certainly with amore intimate contact with wind and sky.§ 5The first serious irruptions of the German tribes into the Roman Empire began inthe third century with the decay of the central power. We will not entangle thereader here with the vexed and intricate question of the names, identity, andinter-relationships of the various Germanic tribes. Historians find greatdifficulties in keeping them distinct, and these difficulties are enhanced bythe fact that they themselves took little care to keep themselves distinct. Wefind in 236 AD a people called the Franks breaking bounds upon the Lower Rhine,and another, the Alamanni, pouring into Alsace. A much more serious pushsouthward was that of the Goths. We have already noted the presence of thesepeople in South Russia, and their division by the Dnieper into Western andEastern Goths. They had become a maritime people again upon the BlackSea—probably their traditional migration from Sweden was along the waterways,for it is still possible to row a boat, with only a few quite practicableportages, from the Baltic right across Russia to either the Black or CaspianSea—and they had wrested the command of the eastern seas from the control ofRome. They were presently raiding the shores of Greece. They also crossed theDanube in a great land raid in 247, and defeated and killed the Emperor Deciusin what is now Serbia. The province of Dacia vanished from Roman history. In 270they were defeated at Nish in Serbia by Claudius, and in 276 they were raidingPontus. It is characteristic of the invertebrate nature of the empire that thelegions of Gaul found that the most effective method of dealing with the Franksand the Alamanni at this time was by setting up a separate emperor in Gaul anddoing the job by themselves.Then for a while the barbarians were held, and the Emperor Probus in 276 forcedthe Franks and the Alamanni back over the Rhine. But it is significant of thegeneral atmosphere of insecurity created by these raids that Aurelian (270-275)fortified Rome, which had been an open and secure city for all the earlier yearsof the empire.In 321 AD the Goths were again over the Danube, plundering what is now Serbiaand Bulgaria. They were driven back by Constantine the Great, of whom we shallhave more to tell in the next chapter. About the end of his reign (337 AD) theVandals, a people closely kindred to the Goths, being pressed by them, obtainedpermission to cross the Danube into Pannonia, which is now that part of Hungarywest of the river.But by the middle of the fourth century the Hunnish people to the east werebecoming aggressive again. They had long subjugated the Alani, and now they madethe Ostrogoths, the east Goths, tributary. The Visigoths (or west Goths)followed the example of the Vandals, and made arrangements to cross the Danubeinto Roman territory. There was some dispute upon the terms of this settlement,and the Visigoths, growing fierce, assumed the offensive, and at Adrianopledefeated the Emperor Valens, who was killed in this battle. They were thenallowed to settle in what is now Bulgaria, and their army became nominally aRoman army, though they retained their own chiefs, the foremost of whom wasAlaric. It exhibits the complete “barbarization” of the Roman empire that hadalready occurred, that the chief opponent of Alaric the Goth, Stilicho, was aPannonian Vandal. The legions in Gaul were under the command of a Frank, and theEmperor Theodosius I (emp. 379-395) was a Spaniard chiefly supported by Gothicauxiliaries.The empire was now splitting finally into an eastern (Greek-speaking) and awestern (Latin-speaking) half. Theodosius the Great was succeeded by his sonsArcadius at Constantinople and Honorius at Ravenna. Alaric made a puppet of theeastern monarch and Stilicho of the western. Huns now first appear within theempire as auxiliary troops enlisted under Stilicho. In this struggle of East andWest, the frontier—if we can still speak of a frontier between the unauthorizedbarbarian without and the barbarian in employment within—gave way. FreshVandals, more Goths, Alans, Suevi, marched freely westward, living upon thecountry. Amidst this confusion occurred a crowning event. Alaric the Gothmarched down Italy, and after a short siege captured Rome (410).By 425 or so, the Vandals (whom originally we noted in East Germany) and aportion of the Alani (whom we first mentioned in Southeast Russia) had traversedGaul and the Pyrenees, and had amalgamated and settled in the south of Spain.There were Huns in possession of Pannonia and Goths in Dalmatia. Into Bohemiaand Moravia came and settled a Slavic people, the Czechs (451). In Portugal andnorth of the Vandals in Spain were Visigoths and Suevi. Gaul was divided amongVisigoths, Franks, and Burgundians. Britain was being invaded by Low Germantribes, the Jutes, Angles and Saxons, before whom the Keltic British of thesouthwest were flying across the sea to what is now Brittany in France. Theusual date given for this invasion is 449, but it was probably earlier.8[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en125] And as the result of intriguesbetween two imperial politicians, the Vandals of the south of Spain, under theirking Genseric, embarked en masse for North Africa (429), became masters ofCarthage (439), secured the mastery of the sea, raided, captured, and pillagedRome (455), crossed into Sicily, and set up a kingdom in West Sicily, whichendured there for a hundred years (up to 534). At the time of its greatestextent (477) this Vandal kingdom included also Corsica, Sardinia, and theBalearic Isles, as well as much of North Africa.168 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_168_r1.gif]About this Vandal kingdom facts and figures are given that show very clearly thetrue nature of these barbarian irruptions. They were not really the conquest andreplacement of one people or race by another; what happened was something verydifferent it was a social revolution started and masked by a superficial foreignconquest. The whole Vandal nation, men, women, and children, that came fromSpain to Africa, for example, did not number more than eighty thousand souls. Weknow this because we have particulars of the transport, problem. In theirstruggle for North Africa, Dr. Schurtz tells us,9[bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en126]. . . there is no trace of any serious resistance offered by the inhabitants;Boniface (the Roman governor of North Africa) had defended Hippo with Gothicmercenaries, while the native population lent no appreciable assistance, and thenomad tribes of the country either adopted a dubious attitude or availedthemselves of the difficulties of the Roman governor to make attacks and engagein predatory expeditions. This demoralization resulted from social conditions,which had perhaps developed more unfavourably in Africa than in other parts ofthe Roman Empire. The free peasants had long ago become the serfs of the greatlanded proprietors, and were little superior in position to the masses of slaveswho were everywhere to be found. And the great landowners had become in theirturn easy victims of the policy of extortion followed by unscrupulous governorsto an increasingly unprecedented extent in proportion as the dignity of theimperial power sank lower. No man who had anything to lose would now take aplace in the senate of the large towns, which had once been the goal of theambitious, for the senators were required to make up all deficiencies in therevenue, and such deficiencies were now frequent and considerable. . . . Bloodyinsurrections repeatedly broke out, always traceable ultimately to the pressureof taxation. . . .Manifestly the Vandals came in as a positive relief to such a system. Theyexterminated the great landowners, wiped out all debts to Roman money-lenders,and abolished the last vestiges of military service. The cultivators foundthemselves better off; the minor officials kept their places; it was not so mucha conquest as a liberation from an intolerable deadlock.It was while the Vandals were still in Africa that a great leader, Attila, aroseamong the Huns. The seat of his government was in the plains east of the Danube.For a time he swayed a considerable empire of Hunnish and Germanic tribes, andhis rule stretched from the Rhine into Central Asia. He negotiated on equalterms with the Chinese emperor. He bullied Ravenna and Constantinople for tenyears. Honoria, the granddaughter of Theodosius II, Emperor of the Easternempire, one of those passionate young ladies who cause so much trouble in theworld, having been put under restraint because of a love affair with a courtchamberlain, sent her ring to Attila and called upon him to be her husband anddeliverer. He was also urged to attack the Eastern empire by Genseric theVandal, who was faced by an alliance of the Western and Eastern emperors. Heraided southward to the very walls of Constantinople, completely destroying,says Gibbon, seventy cities in his progress, and forcing upon the emperor anonerous peace, which apparently did not involve the liberation of Honoria to herhero.At this distance of time we are unable to guess at the motives for thisomission. Attila continued to speak of her as his affianced bride, and to usethe relationship as a pretext for aggressions. In the subsequent negotiations acertain Priscus accompanied an embassy to the camp of the Hunnish monarch, andthe fragments that still survive of the narrative he wrote give us a glimpse ofthe camp and way of living of the great conqueror.The embassy was itself a curiously constituted body. Its head was Maximin, anhonest diplomatist who went in good faith. Quite unknown to him and, at thetime, to Priscus, Vigilius, the interpreter of the expedition, had also a secretmission from the court of Theodosius which was to secure by bribery theassassination of Attila. The little expedition went by way of Nish; it crossedthe Danube in canoes, dug out of a single tree, and it was fed by contributionsfrom the villages on the route. Differences in dietary soon attracted theattention of the envoys. Priscus mentions mead in the place of wine, millet forcorn, and a drink either distilled10 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en127]or brewed from barley. The journey through Hungary will remind the reader inmany of its incidents of the journeys of travellers in Central Africa during theVictorian period. The travellers were politely offered temporary wives.Attila’s capital was rather a vast camp and village than a town. There was onlyone building of stone, a bath constructed on the Roman model. The mass of thepeople were in huts and tents; Attila and his leading men lived in timberpalaces in great stockaded enclosures with their numerous wives and ministersabout them. There was a vast display of loot, but Attila himself affected anomadic simplicity; he was served in wooden cups and platters, and never touchedbread. He worked hard, kept open court before the gate of his palace, and wascommonly in the saddle. The primitive custom of both Aryans and Mongols ofholding great feasts in hall still held good, and there was much hard drinking.Priscus describes how bards chanted before Attila. They. . . recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his valour andhis victories. A profound silence prevailed in the hall, and the attention ofthe guests was captivated by the vocal harmony, which revived and perpetuatedthe memory of their own exploits; a martial ardour flashed from the eyes of thewarriors, who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men expressedtheir generous despair, that they could no longer partake the danger and gloryof the field. This entertainment, which might be considered as a school ofmilitary virtue, was succeeded by a farce that debased the dignity of humannature. A Moorish and Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of therude spectators by their deformed figures, ridiculous dress, antic gestures,absurd speeches, and the strange, unintelligible confusion of the Latin, theGothic, and the Hunnish languages, and the hall resounded with loud andlicentious peals of laughter. In the midst of this intemperate riot, Attilaalone, without change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexiblegravity.11 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_nts_r1.html#en128]Although Attila was aware, through the confession of the proposed assassin, ofthe secret work of Vigilius, he allowed this embassy to return in safety, withpresents of numerous horses and the like, to Constantinople. Then he despatchedan ambassador to Theodosius II to give that monarch, as people say, a piece ofhis mind. “Theodosius,” said the envoy,. . . is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent; Attila, likewise, isdescended from a noble race; and he has supported, by his actions the dignitywhich he inherited from his father Munzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited hisparental honours, and, by consenting to pay tribute, has degraded himself to thecondition of a slave. It is therefore just that he should reverence the man whomfortune and merit have placed above him; instead of attempting, like a wickedslave, clandestinely to conspire against his master.This straightforward bullying was met by abject submission. The emperor sued forpardon, and paid a great ransom.In 451 Attila declared war on the western empire. He invaded Gaul. So far as theimperial forces were concerned, he had things all his own way, and he sackedmost of the towns of France as far south as Orleans. Then the Franks andVisigoths and the imperial forces united against him, and a great and obstinatebattle at Troyes (451), in which over 150,000 men were killed on both sides,ended in his repulse and saved Europe from a Mongolian overlord. This disasterby no means exhausted Attila’s resources. He turned his attention southward, andoverran North Italy. He burnt Aquileia and Padua, and looted Milan, but he madepeace at the entreaty of Pope Leo I. He died in 453. . . .Hereafter the Huns, so far as that name goes in Europe, the Huns of Attila,disappeared out of history. They dissolve into the surrounding populations. Theywere probably already much mixed, and rather Aryan than Mongolian. They did notbecome, as one might suppose, the inhabitants of Hungary, though they haveprobably left many descendants there. About a hundred years after came anotherHunnish or mixed people, the Avars, out of the east into Hungary, but these weredriven out eastward again by Charlemagne in 791-5. The Magyars, the modernHungarians, came westward later. They were a Turko-Finnish people. The Magyar isa language belonging to the Finno-Ugrian division of the Ural-Altaic tongues.The Magyars were on the Volga about 550. They settled in Hungary about 900. . .. But we are getting too far on in our story, and we must return to Rome.In 493 Theodoric, a Goth, became King of Rome, but already for seventeen yearsthere had been no Roman emperor. So it was in utter social decay and collapsethat the great slave-holding “world-ascendancy” of the God-Cæsars and the richmen of Rome came to an end.§ 6But though throughout the whole of Western Europe and North Africa the Romanimperial system had collapsed, though credit had vanished, luxury production hadceased and money was hidden, though creditors were going unpaid and slavesmasterless, the tradition of the Cæsars was still being carried on inConstantinople. We have already had occasion to mention as two outstandingfigures among the late Cæsars, Diocletian (284) and Constantine the Great (312),and it was to the latter of these that the world owes the setting up of a freshimperial centre at Constantinople. Very early during the imperial period theunsuitability of the position of Rome as a world capital, due to the Romanfailure to use the sea, was felt. The destruction of Carthage and Corinth hadkilled the shipping of the main Mediterranean sea-routes. For a people who didnot use the sea properly, having the administrative centre at Rome meant thatevery legion, every draft of officials, every order, had to travel northward forhalf the length of Italy before it could turn east or west. Consequently nearlyall the more capable emperors set up their headquarters at some subordinatecentre in a more convenient position. Sirmium (on the River Save), Milan, Lyons,and Nicomedia (in Bithynia) were among such supplementary capitals. For a timeunder Diocletian, Durazzo was the imperial capital. Ravenna, near the head ofthe Adriatic, was the capital of the last Roman emperors in the time of Alaricand Stilicho.169 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_169_r1.gif]It was Constantine the Great who determined upon the permanent transfer of thecentre of imperial power to the Bosphorus. We have already noted the existenceof the city of Byzantium, which Constantine chose to develop into his newcapital. It played a part in the story of the intricate Histiæus (Chap. xxi, §4); it repulsed Philip of Macedon (Chap. xxiii, § 3). If the reader will examineits position, he will see that in the hands of a line of capable emperors, andas the centre of a people with some solidarity and spirit and seacraft (neitherof which things were vouchsafed to it), it was extraordinarily well placed. Itsgalleys could have penetrated up the rivers to the heart of Russia andoutflanked every barbarian advance. It commanded practicable trade routes to theeast, and it was within a reasonable striking distance of Mesopotamia, Egypt,Greece, and all the more prosperous and civilized regions of the world at thatperiod. And even under the rule of a series of inept monarchs and underdemoralized social conditions, the remains of the Roman Empire centring atConstantinople held out for nearly a thousand years.It was the manifest intention of Constantine the Great that Constantinopleshould be the centre of an undivided empire. But having regard to the methods oftravel and transport available at the time, the geographical conditions ofEurope and Western Asia do not point to anyone necessary centre of government.If Rome faced westward instead of eastward, and so failed to reach out beyondthe Euphrates, Constantinople on the other hand was hopelessly remote from Gaul.The enfeebled Mediterranean civilization, after a certain struggle for Italy,did in fact let go of the west altogether and concentrated upon what werepractically the central vestiges, the stump, of the empire of Alexander. TheGreek language resumed its sway, which had never been very seriously underminedby the official use of Latin. This “Eastern” or Byzantine empire is generallyspoken of as if it were a continuation of the Roman tradition. It is really farmore like a resumption of Alexander’s.The Latin language had not the intellectual vigour behind it, it had not theliterature and the science, to make it a necessity to intelligent men and so tomaintain an ascendancy over the Greek. For no language, whatever officialdom maydo, can impose itself in competition with another that can offer the advantagesof a great literature or encyclopædic information. Aggressive languages mustbring gifts, and the gifts of Greek were incomparably greater than the gifts ofLatin. The Eastern empire was from the beginnings of its separationGreek-speaking, and a continuation, though a degenerate continuation, of theHellenic tradition. Its intellectual centre was no longer in Greece, butAlexandria. Its mentality was no longer the mentality of free-mindedplain-speaking citizens, of the Stagirite Aristotle and the Greek Plato; itsmentality was the mentality of the pedants and of men politically impotent; itsphilosophy was a pompous evasion of real things, and its scientific impulse wasdead. Nevertheless, it was Hellenic and not Latin. The Roman had come, and hehad gone again. Indeed he had gone very extensively from the west also. By thesixth century AD the populations of Europe and North Africa had been stirred uplike sediment. When presently in the seventh and eighth centuries the sedimentbegins to settle down again and populations begin to take on a definitelocalized character, the Roman is only to be found by name in the region aboutRome. Over large parts of his Western empire we find changed and changingmodifications of his Latin speech; in Gaul, where the Frank is learning a Gallicform of Latin and evolving French in the process; in Italy, where, under theinfluence of Teutonic invaders, the Lombards and Goths, Latin is being modifiedinto various Italian dialects; in Spain and Portugal, where it is becomingSpanish and Portuguese. The fundamental Latinity of the languages in theseregions serves to remind us of the numerical unimportance of the variousFrankish, Vandal, Avar, Gothic, and the like German-speaking invaders, andserves to justify our statement that what happened to the Western empire was notso much conquest and the replacement of one population by another as a politicaland social revolution. The district of Valais in South Switzerland also retaineda fundamentally Latin speech and so did the Canton Grisons; and, what is morecurious and interesting, is that in Dacia and Mœsia Inferior, large parts ofwhich to the north of the Danube became the modern Roumania (== Romania),although these regions were added late to the empire and lost soon, the Latinspeech also remained.In Britain Latin was practically wiped out by the conquering Anglo-Saxons, fromamong whose various dialects the root stock of English presently grew.But while the smashing of the Roman social and political structure was thuscomplete, while in the east it was thrown off by the older and stronger Hellenictradition, and while in the west it was broken up into fragments that began totake on a new and separate life of their own, there was one thing that did notperish, but grew, and that was the tradition of the world empire of Rome and ofthe supremacy of the Cæsars. When the reality was destroyed, the legend hadfreedom to expand. Removed from the possibility of verification, the idea of aserene and splendid Roman world-supremacy grew up in the imagination of mankind,and still holds it to this day.170 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_170_r1.gif]Ever since the time of Alexander, human thought has been haunted by the possiblepolitical unity of the race. All the sturdy chiefs and leaders and kings of thebarbarians, who raided through the prostrate but vast disorder of the decayedempire, were capable of conceiving of some mighty king of kings greater thanthemselves and giving a real law for all men, and they were ready to believethat elsewhere in space and time, and capable of returning presently to resumehis supremacy, Cæsar had been such a king of kings. Far above their own titles,therefore, they esteemed and envied the title of Cæsar. The internationalhistory of Europe from this time henceforth is largely the story of kings andadventurers setting up to be Cæsar and Imperator (Emperor). We shall tell ofsome of them in their places. So universal did this “Cæsaring” become, that theGreat War of 1914-18 mowed down no fewer than four Cæsars, the German Kaiser (==Cæsar), the Austrian Kaiser, the Tsar (== Cæsar) of Russia, and that fantasticfigure, the Tsar of Bulgaria. The French “Imperator” (Napoleon III) had alreadyfallen in 1871. There is now (1920) no one left in the world to carry on theImperial title or the tradition of Divus Cæsar except the Turkish Sultan and theBritish monarch. The former commemorates his lordship over Constantinople asKaisar-i-Roum; the latter is called the Cæsar of India (a country no real Cæsarever looked upon), Kaisar-i-Hind."},{"pageContent":"ENDNOTES171 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_171_r1.jpg]VOLUME ICHAPTER II1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c02_r1.html#Ref-en1] Here in this history of life weare doing our best to give only known and established facts in the broadest way,and to reduce to a minimum the speculative element that must necessarily enterinto our account.

They write and speak of living “Neanderthalers” in contemporarypopulations. One observer has written in the past of such types in the west ofIreland; another has observed them in Greece. These so-called “livingNeanderthalers” have neither the peculiarities of neck, thumb, nor teeth thatdistinguish the Neanderthal race of pre-men. The cheek teeth of true men, forinstance, have what we call fangs, long fangs; the Neanderthaler’s cheek toothis a more complicated and specialized cheek tooth, a long tooth with shortfangs, and his canine teeth were less marked, less like dog-teeth, than ours.Nothing could show more clearly that he was on a different line of development.We must remember that so far only western Europe has been properly explored forPalæolithic remains, and that practically all we know of the Neanderthal speciescomes from that area (see map, p. 53). No doubt the ancestor of Homo sapiens(which species includes the Tasmanians) was a very similar and parallel creatureto Homo neanderthalensis. And we are not so far from that ancestor as to haveeliminated not indeed “Neanderthal,” but “Neanderthaloid” types. The existenceof such types no more proves that the Neanderthal species, the makers of theChellean and Mousterian implements, interbred with Homo sapiens in the Europeanarea than do monkey-faced people testify to an interbreeding with monkeys; orpeople with faces like horses, that there is an equine strain in our population.2 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c09_r1.html#Ref-en14] R.

One may find, for instance,Thethmosis, Thoutmosis, Tahutmes, Thutmose, or Tethmosis; Amunothph, Amenhotepor Amenothes. A pleasing variation is to break up the name, as, for instance,Amen Hetep. This particular little constellation of variants is given here notonly because it is amusing, but because it is desirable that the reader shouldknow such variations exist. For most names the rule of this book has been tofollow whatever usage has established itself in English literature, regardlessof the possible contemporary pronunciation. Amenophis, for example, has been sowritten in English books for two centuries. It came into the language byindirect routes, but it is now as fairly established as is Damascus as theEnglish name of a Syrian town. Nevertheless, there are limits to thisclassicism.

This must havegreatly restricted the desert routes. (See Bunbury, History of AncientGeography, note to Chap. VIII). But the Sahara desert of 3,000 or 2,000 yearsago was less parched and sterile than it is today. From rock engravings we maydeduce the theory that the desert was crossed from oasis to oasis by riding oxenand by oxcarts: perhaps, also, on horses and asses. The camel as a beast oftransport was seemingly not introduced into North Africa till the Arab invasionsof the seventh century AD. The fossil remains of camels are found in Algeria,and wild camels may have lingered in the wastes of the Sahara and Somalilandtill the domesticated camel was introduced.

If such an edict could have beenmaintained in force for a generation, combined with the other mandates of theThirty—the city out of which Sophocles and Euripides had just died, and in whichPlato and Isocrates were in vigorous age, would have been degraded to theintellectual level of the meanest community in Greece. It was not uncommon for aGrecian despot to suppress all those assemblies wherein youths came together forthe purpose of common training, either intellectual or gymnastic, as well as thepublic banquets and clubs or associations, as being dangerous to his authority,tending to elevation of courage, and to a consciousness of political rightsamong the citizens.—Grote’s History of Greece5 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c22_r1.html#Ref-en88] Mahaffy.6 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c22_r1.html#Ref-en89] Ancient Greek Literature.7 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c22_r1.html#Ref-en90] Jung in his Psychology of theUnconscious is very good in his chapter 1 on the differences between ancient(pre-Athenian) thought and modern thought. The former he calls UndirectedThinking, the latter Directed Thinking. The former was a thinking in images,akin to dreaming; the latter a thinking in words. Science is an organization ofdirected thinking. The Antique spirit (before the Greek thinkers i.e.,) creatednot science but mythology. The ancient human world was a world of subjectivefantasies like the world of children and uneducated young people today, and likethe world of savages and dreams. Infantile thought and dreams are a re-echo ofprehistoric and savage methods of thinking. Myths, says Jung, are the massdreams of peoples, and dreams the myths of individuals. We have already directedthe reader’s attention to the resemblance of the early gods of civilization tothe fantasies of children. The work of hard and disciplined thinking by means ofcarefully analyzed words and statements which was begun by the Greek thinkersand resumed by the scholastic philosophers of whom we shall tell in the middleages, was a necessary preliminary to the development of modern science.8 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c22_r1.html#Ref-en91] “For the proper administrationof justice and for the distribution of authority it is necessary that thecitizens be acquainted with each other’s characters, so that, where this cannotbe, much mischief ensues, both in the use of authority and in the administrationof justice; for it is not just to decide arbitrarily, as must be the case withexcessive population.” Aristotle: Politics.CHAPTER XXIII1 [bano_9781411428843_oeb_c23_r1.html#Ref-en92] Mahaffy.

It had been the custom to publish theannual edict of the prætor in this fashion. There were professionalletter-writers who sent news by special courier to rich country correspondents,and these would copy down the stuff upon the Album (white board). Cicero, whilehe was governor in Cilicia, got the current news from such a professionalcorrespondent. He complains in one letter that it was not what he wanted; theexpert was too full of the chariot races and other sporting intelligence, andfailed to give any view of the political situation.

The Greeks cited gladiatorial shows as a reason for regardingthe Romans as Barbaroi, and there were riots when some Roman proconsul tried tointroduce them in Corinth. Among Romans, the better people evidently dislikedthem, but a sort of shyness prevented them from frankly denouncing them ascruel. For instance, Cicero, when he had to attend the Circus, took his tabletsand his secretary with him, and didn’t look. He expresses particular disgust atthe killing of an elephant; and somebody in Tacitus (Drusus, Ann. 1. 76) wasunpopular because he was too fond of gladiatorial bloodshed—“ quamquam vilisanguine nimis gaudens” (“rejoicing too much in blood, worthless blood though itwas”). The games were unhesitatingly condemned by Greek philosophy, and atdifferent times two Cynics and one Christian gave their lives in the arena,protesting against them, before they were abolished.I do not think Christianity had any such relation to slavery as is here stated.St. Paul’s action in sending back a slave to his master, and his injunction,“Slaves, obey your masters,” were regularly quoted on the pro-slavery side, downto the nineteenth century; on the other hand, both the popular philosophies andthe Mystery religions were against slavery in their whole tendency, andChristianity of course in time became the chief representative of thesemovements. Probably the best test is the number of slaves who occupied posts ofhonour in the religious and philosophic systems, like Epictetus, for instance,or the many slaves who hold offices in the Mithraic Inscriptions. I do nothappen to know if any slaves were made Christian bishops, but by analogy Ishould think it likely that some were. In all the Mystery religions, as soon asyou entered the community, and had communion with God, earthly distinctionsshrivelled away. G.
