His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually paleface was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly, and the soft radianceof the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles thatflashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced andcaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxuriousafter-dinner atmosphere when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels ofprecision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the points with a leanforefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox(as we thought it:) and his fecundity.“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two ideas thatare almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you atschool is founded on a misconception.”“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said Filby, anargumentative person with red hair.“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it.You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that amathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real existence. They taughtyou that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.”“That is all right,” said the Psychologist.“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a realexistence.”“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All realthings—”“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube exist?”“Don’t follow you,” said Filby.“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?”Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any real bodymust have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness,and—Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explainto you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really fourdimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the formerthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness movesintermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the endof our lives.”“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigarover the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,” continuedthe Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. “Really this iswhat is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about theFourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking atTime. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions ofSpace except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people havegot hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have tosay about this Fourth Dimension?”1“I have not,” said the Provincial Mayor.“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of ashaving three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, andis always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to theothers. But some philosophical people have been asking why three dimensionsparticularly—why not another direction at right angles to the other three?—andhave even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry. Professor Simon Newcombwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago.You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can representa figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by modelsof three dimensions they could represent one of four—if they could master theperspective of the thing. See?”“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor, and, knitting his brows, he lapsedinto an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words.“Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some time, brightening in a quitetransitory manner.“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of FourDimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here isa portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another atseventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections,as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being,which is a fixed and unalterable thing.“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required forthe proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time is only a kind ofSpace. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I tracewith my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high,yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upwardto here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions ofSpace generally recognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line,therefore, we must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.”2“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if Time isreally only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been,regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move aboutin the other dimensions of Space?”The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you sure we can move freely in Space? Right andleft we can go, back-ward and forward freely enough, and men always have doneso. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down?Gravitation limits us there.”“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of thesurface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.“Easier, far easier down than up.”“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the presentmoment.”“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the wholeworld has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Ourmental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passingalong the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave.Just as we should travel down if we began our existence fifty miles above theearth’s surface.”“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. “You can moveabout in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.”“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannotmove about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly Igo back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absentminded, as you say. Ijump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for anylength of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feetabove the ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in thisrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he nothope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along theTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”“Oh, this,” began Filby, “is all—”“Why not?” said the Time Traveller.“It’s against reason,” said Filby.“What reason?” said the Time Traveller.“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will neverconvince me.”“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the object ofmy investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vagueinkling of a machine—”“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as thedriver determines.”Filby contented himself with laughter.“But I have experimental verification,”3 said the Time Traveller.“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologistsuggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battleof Hastings, for instance!”“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man. “Ourancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the VeryYoung Man thought.“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The Germanscholars have improved Greek so much.”4“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One mightinvest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry on ahead!”“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic basis.”5“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist.“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify that?”“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s allhumbug, you know.”The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and with hishands deep in his trouser pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and weheard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory.The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby tried totell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem;6 but before he had finished hispreface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s anecdote collapsed.The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallicframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. Therewas ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must beexplicit, for this that follows—unless his explanation is to be accepted—is anabsolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables thatwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs onthe hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair,and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, thebright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozencandles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces,so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearestthe fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Travellerand the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The MedicalMan and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, thePsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. Wewere all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick,however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played uponus under these conditions.The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?” said thePsychologist.“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the tableand pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only a model. It is myplan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it lookssingularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar,as though it was in some way unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger.“Also, here is one little white lever, and here is another.”The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. “It’sbeautifully made,” he said.“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had allimitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want you clearly tounderstand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the maching gliding intothe future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seatof a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off themachine will go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have agood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there isno trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a quack.”There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak tome, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towardsthe lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your hand.” And turning to thePsychologist, he took that individual’s hand in his own and told him to put outhis forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the modelTime Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I amabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and thelamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and thelittle machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost fora second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it wasgone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table.At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he said, with areminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jaron the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe.We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in earnestabout this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?”“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire.Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s face. (ThePsychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar andtried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished inthere”—he indicated the laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to havea journey on my own account.”“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said Filby.“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have gone intothe past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.“Why?” said the Time Traveller.“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into thefuture it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelledthrough this time.”“But,” I said, “if it travelled into the past it would have been visible when wecame first into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and the Thursdaybefore that; and so forth!”7“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air ofimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You think. Youcan explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you know, dilutedpresentation.”“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple point ofpsychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough, and helps theparadox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, anymore than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through theair. If it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster thanwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, theimpression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth ofwhat it would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” Hepassed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You see?” hesaid, laughing.We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the TimeTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.“It sounds plausible enough to-night,” said the Medical Man; “but wait untilto-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time Traveller. Andtherewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughtycorridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer,broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him,puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a largeredition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes.Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn outof rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystallinebars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I tookone up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is this atrick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, “I intendto explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.”None of us quite knew how to take it.I caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at mesolemnly."},{"pageContent":"IIImage [../images/comman.jpg]I THINK THAT at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. Thefact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to bebelieved: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected somesubtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filbyshown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller’s words, weshould have shown him far less scepticism. For we should have perceived hismotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had morethan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things thatwould have made the frame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It isa mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriouslynever felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trustingtheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery withegg-shell china. So I don’t think any of us said very much about time travellingin the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its oddpotentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is,its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and ofutter confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupiedwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean.1 He said he had seen a similar thing atTübingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out of the candle. But howthe trick was done he could not explain.The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the TimeTraveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or five menalready assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before thefire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. I lookedround for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s half-past seven now,” said the MedicalMan. “I suppose we’d better have dinner?”“Where’s ———?” said I, naming our host.“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks me inthis note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says he’ll explainwhen he comes.”“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a well-known dailypaper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who hadattended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editoraforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with abeard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went, never openedhis mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at the dinner-table aboutthe Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocularspirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologistvolunteered a wooden account of the “ingenious paradox and trick” we hadwitnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the doorfrom the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, andsaw it first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and theTime Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good heavens! man,what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the wholetableful turned towards the door.He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared withgreen down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to megreyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded. Hisface was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut half healed; hisexpression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering. For a moment hehesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he cameinto the room. He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsoretramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion towardsthe wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it towards him. Hedrained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked round the table, and theghost of his old smile flickered across his face. “What on earth have you beenup to, man?” said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’tlet me disturb you,” he said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m allright.” He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into hischeeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, andthen went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as itwere feeling his way among his words. “I’m going to wash and dress, and thenI’ll come down and explain things. . . . Save me some of that mutton. I’mstarving for a bit of meat.”He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was allright. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said the TimeTraveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I remarkedhis lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in myplace, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair oftattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mindto follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself. For aminute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of anEminent Scientist,” I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) inheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur Cadger?2I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my owninterpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping painfullyupstairs. I don’t think any one else had noticed his lameness.The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man, who rangthe bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at dinner—for a hotplate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork with a grunt, and theSilent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatoryfor a little while, with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent inhis curiosity. “Does our friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? orhas he his Nebuchadnezzar3 phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s thisbusiness of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account ofour previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Editor raisedobjections. “What was this time travelling? A man couldn’t cover himself withdust by rolling in a paradox, could he?” And then, as the idea came home to him,he resorted to caricature. Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? TheJournalist, too, would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in theeasy work of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind ofjournalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special Correspondent in theDay after To-morrow reports,” the Journalist was saying—or rather shouting—whenthe Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes, andnothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had startled me.“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have beentravelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little Rosebery,4will you? What will you take for the lot?”The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word. He smiledquietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What a treat it is tostick a fork into meat again!”“Story!” cried the Editor.“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I won’tsay a word until I get some peptone5 into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.”“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The TimeTraveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with hisfingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face, startedconvulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. Formy own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it wasthe same with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by tellinganecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his attention to hisdinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked acigarette, and watched the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Manseemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity anddetermination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed hisplate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must apologize,” he said. “I wassimply starving. I’ve had a most amazing time.” He reached out his hand for acigar, and cut the end. “But come into the smoking-room. It’s too long a storyto tell over greasy plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the wayinto the adjoining room.“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said to me,leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor.“I can’t argue to-night. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t argue.I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to me, if youlike, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most ofit will sound like lying. So be it! It’s true—every word of it, all the same. Iwas in my laboratory at four o’clock, and since then . . . I’ve lived eight days... such days as no human being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but Ishan’t sleep till I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. Butno interruptions! Is it agreed?”“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with that theTime Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back in his chairat first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more animated. Inwriting it down I feel with only too much keenness the inadequacy of pen andink—and, above all, my own inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I willsuppose, attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincereface in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation of hisvoice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of his story! Mostof us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the smoking-room had not beenlighted, and only the face of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man fromthe knees downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at eachother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the TimeTraveller’s face."},{"pageContent":"IIIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“I TOLD SOME OF YOU last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, andshowed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now,a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brassrail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday,but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one ofthe nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; sothat the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o’clock to-daythat the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap,tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and satmyself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feelsmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the startinglever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, andalmost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation offalling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Hadanything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me.Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minuteor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, andwent off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett camein and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I supposeit took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shootacross the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position.The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment cameto-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter.To-morrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster andfaster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusednessdescended on my mind.“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. Theyare excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon aswitchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation,too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like theflapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presentlyto fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leapingit every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory hadbeen destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression ofscaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any movingthings. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. Thetwinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye.Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly throughher quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars.Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night andday merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness ofblue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking sunbecame a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainterfluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then abrighter circle flickering in the blue.“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side upon which thishouse now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw treesgrowing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew,spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair,and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the earth seemed changed—melting andflowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speedraced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up anddown, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently mypace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashedacross the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green ofspring.“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged atlast into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked indeed a clumsy swayingof the machine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confusedto attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself intofuturity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything butthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in mymind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last they tookcomplete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderfuladvances upon our rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when Icame to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated beforemy eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massivethan any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer andmist. I saw a richer green flow up the hill-side, and remain there without anywintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed veryfair. And so my mind came round to the business of stopping.“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in thespace which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a highvelocity through time, this scarcely mattered; I was, so to speak,attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of interveningsubstances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule bymolecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into suchintimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemicalreaction—possibly a far-reaching explosion—would result, and blow myself and myapparatus out of all possible dimensions—into the Unknown.1 This possibility hadoccurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I hadcheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man has got totake! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerfullight. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, thesickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolongedfalling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told myself that I could never stop,and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatientfool, I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,and I was flung headlong through the air.“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunnedfor a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on softturf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, butpresently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me.I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendronbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in ashower under the beating of the hail-stones. The rebounding, dancing hail hungin a cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a momentI was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has travelledinnumerable years to see you.’“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked roundme. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomedindistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else ofthe world was invisible.“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, Isaw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-treetouched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a wingedsphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, werespread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was ofbronze, and was thick with verdigris.2 It chanced that the face was towards me;the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile onthe lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasantsuggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a minute,perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drovebefore it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment, andsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lighteningwith the promise of the sun.“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of myvoyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain wasaltogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty hadgrown into a common passion? What if in this interval the race had lost itsmanliness, and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, andoverwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only themore dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to beincontinently slain.“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets and tallcolumns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping in upon me through the lesseningstorm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine,and strove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote throughthe thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like thetrailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky,some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildingsabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm,and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. Ifelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clearair, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I tooka breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee,with the machine. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the otheron the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked morecuriously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circularopening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures cladin rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the WhiteSphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in apathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine.He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet high—clad in a purple tunic, girdledat the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins—I could not clearlydistinguish which—were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and hishead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribablyfrail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind ofconsumptive3—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sightof him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from the machine."},{"pageContent":"IVImage [../images/comman.jpg]“IN ANOTHER MOMENT we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing outof futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The absencefrom his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he turned to thetwo others who were following him and spoke to them in a strange and very sweetand liquid tongue.“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight or tenof these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed me. It cameinto my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh and deep for them. So Ishook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook it again. He came a step forward,hesitated, and then touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentaclesupon my back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There wasnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these prettylittle people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certainchild-like ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy myselfflinging the whole dozen of them about like nine-pins. But I made a suddenmotion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling at the TimeMachine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I hadhitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed thelittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then Iturned again to see what I could do in the way of communication.“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some furtherpeculiarities in their Dresden-china1 type of prettiness. Their hair, which wasuniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there was not thefaintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were singularly minute.The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chinsran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and—this may seem egotism on mypart—I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might haveexpected in them.“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round mesmiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began theconversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then hesitating for amoment how to express time, I pointed to the sun. At once a quaintly prettylittle figure in chequered purple and white followed my gesture, and thenastonished me by imitating the sound of thunder.“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was plainenough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these creatures fools?You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I had always anticipated thatthe people of the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly infront of us in knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me aquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of ourfive-year-old children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in athunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes,their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of disappointment rushedacross my mind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time Machine in vain.“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of athunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed. Thencame one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful flowers altogethernew to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was received with melodiousapplause; and presently they were all running to and fro for flowers, andlaughingly flinging them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. Youwho have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderfulflowers countless years of culture had created. Then someone suggested thattheir plaything should be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was ledpast the sphinx of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while witha smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As Iwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a profoundly graveand intellectual posterity came, with irresistible merriment, to my mind.“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal dimensions. I wasnaturally most occupied with the growing crowd of little people, and with thebig open portals that yawned before me shadowy and mysterious. My generalimpression of the world I saw over their heads was a tangled waste of beautifulbushes and flowers, a long-neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number oftall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spreadof the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegatedshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The TimeMachine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons.“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not observe thecarving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of old Phoenician2decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they were very badlybroken and weather-worn. Several more brightly clad people met me in thedoorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments,looking grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an eddyingmass of bright, soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodiouswhirl of laughter and laughing speech.“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with brown. Theroof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with coloured glass andpartially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The floor was made up of hugeblocks of some very hard white metal, not plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was somuch worn, as I judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to bedeeply channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length wereinnumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised perhaps a foot fromthe floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognized as a kind ofhypertrophied3 raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were strange.“Between the tables were scattered a great number of cushions. Upon these myconductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise. With a prettyabsence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their hands, flinging peeland stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in the sides of the tables. Iwas not loath to follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I didso I surveyed the hall at my leisure.“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. Thestained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were brokenin many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end were thick withdust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the marble table near me wasfractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque.There were, perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most ofthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with interest,their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in thesame soft, and yet strong, silky material.“Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote future werestrict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some carnal cravings,I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards that horses, cattle,sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits werevery delightful; one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time Iwas there—a floury thing in a threesided husk—was especially good, and I made itmy staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits, and by thestranger flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their import.“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now. So soonas my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a resolute attempt tolearn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly that was the next thing todo. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of theseup I began a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had someconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with astare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-hairedlittle creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had tochatter and explain the business at great length to each other, and my firstattempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immenseamount of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, andpersisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at mycommand; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to get awayfrom my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity, to let them givetheir lessons in little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses Ifound they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more easilyfatigued.“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their lackof interest. They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment, likechildren, but like children they would soon stop examining me and wander awayafter some other toy. The dinner and my conversational beginnings ended, I notedfor the first time that almost all those who had surrounded me at first weregone. It is odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. Iwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again so soon as my hunger wassatisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future, who wouldfollow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having smiled andgesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own devices.“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great hall, andthe scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first things were veryconfusing. Everything was so entirely different from the world I had known—eventhe flowers. The big building I had left was situated on the slope of a broadriver valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its presentposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and ahalf away, from which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the yearEight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One A.D. For that, I shouldexplain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded.“As I walked I was watchful for every impression that could possibly help toexplain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the world—forruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a great heap ofgranite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitouswalls and crumbled heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautifulpagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but wonderfully tinted with brown about theleaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of somevast structure, to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I wasdestined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the firstintimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in its properplace.“Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested for awhile, I realized that there were no small houses to be seen. Apparently thesingle house, and possibly even the household, had vanished. Here and thereamong the greenery were palacelike buildings, but the house and the cottage,which form such characteristic features of our own English landscape, haddisappeared.“ ‘Communism,’4 said I to myself.“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-dozenlittle figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived that allhad the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and the samegirlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I had not noticedthis before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough.In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark offthe sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And thechildren seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged,then, that the children of that time were extremely precocious, physically atleast, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my opinion.“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt thatthis close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would expect; for thestrength of a man and the softness of a woman, the institution of the family,and the differentiation of occupations are mere militant necessities of an ageof physical force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearingbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where violence comes butrarely and offspring are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is nonecessity—for an efficient family, and the specialization of the sexes5 withreference to their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of thiseven in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I mustremind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how farit fell short of the reality.“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a prettylittle structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory way ofthe oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of myspeculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of the hill, and asmy walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was presently left alone for thefirst time. With a strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to thecrest.“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize, corroded inplaces with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, thearm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins’ heads. I sat down onit, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that longday. It was as sweet and fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had alreadygone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with somehorizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, inwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of thegreat palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and somestill occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the wastegarden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupolaor obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidencesof agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had seen, andas it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in thisway. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half-truth—or only a glimpse of onefacet of the truth.)“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The ruddysunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time I began torealize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at presentengaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength isthe outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. The work ofameliorating the conditions of life—the true civilizing process that makes lifemore and more secure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a unitedhumanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere dreams hadbecome projects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvestwas what I saw!“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still in therudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little departmentof the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its operations verysteadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed justhere and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leavingthe greatest number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favouriteplants and animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now anew and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, nowa more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our idealsare vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too,is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organized,and still better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. Thewhole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things will movefaster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely andcarefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit ourhuman needs.“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done indeed for allTime, in the space of Time across which my machine had leaped. The air was freefrom gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet anddelightful flowers; brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal ofpreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw noevidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tellyou later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundlyaffected by these changes.“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in splendidshelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them engaged in no toil.There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor economical struggle. Theshop, the advertisement, traffic, all that commerce which constitutes the bodyof our world, was gone. It was natural on that golden evening that I should jumpat the idea of a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population hadbeen met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the change.What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause of humanintelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions under which theactive, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to the wall; conditionsthat put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint,patience, and decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions thatarise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parentalself-devotion, all found their justification and support in the imminent dangersof the young. Now, where are these imminent dangers? There is a sentimentarising, and it will grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity,against passion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make usuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life.“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of intelligence,and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief in a perfectconquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet. Humanity had been strong,energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its abundant vitality to alter theconditions under which it lived. And now came the reaction of the alteredconditions.“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless energy,that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in our own time certaintendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a constant source offailure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for instance, are no greathelp—may even be hindrances—to a civilized man. And in a state of physicalbalance and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out ofplace. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or solitaryviolence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength ofconstitution, no need of toil. For such a life, what we should call the weak areas well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equippedindeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which therewas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was theoutcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before itsettled down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—theflourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has ever beenthe fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then comelanguor and decay.“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in the Time Isaw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the sunlight: somuch was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that would fade in theend into a contented inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain andnecessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful grindstone broken atlast!“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simpleexplanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole secret ofthese delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for the increase ofpopulation had succeeded too well, and their numbers had rather diminished thankept stationary. That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was myexplanation, and plausible enough—as most wrong theories are!"},{"pageContent":"VImage [../images/comman.jpg]“AS I STOOD THERE musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full moon,yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in the northeast.The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a noiseless owl flittedby, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I determined to descend and findwhere I could sleep.“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the figure ofthe White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct as the light ofthe rising moon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch against it. Therewas the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the pale light, and there wasthe little lawn. I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled mycomplacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly to myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’“But it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was towards it.Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to me? But you cannot.The Time Machine was gone!“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my ownage, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare thought of itwas an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at the throat and stopmy breathing. In another moment I was in a passion of fear and running withgreat leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; Ilost no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warmtrickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘Theyhave moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the time, with the certainty thatsometimes comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knewinstinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came withpain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the littlelawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man. I cursedaloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine, wasting goodbreath thereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a creature seemed to bestirring in that moonlit world.“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace of the thingwas to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty space among theblack tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the thing might behidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair.Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous,in the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay.“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put themechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical andintellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of some hithertounsuspected power, through whose intervention my invention had vanished. Yet,for one thing I felt assured: unless some other age had produced its exactduplicate, the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of thelevers—I will show you the method later—prevented any one from tampering with itin that way when they were removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space.But then, where could it be?“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently in andout among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling some whiteanimal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I remember, too, latethat night, beating the bushes with my clenched fist until my knuckles weregashed and bleeding from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in myanguish of mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall wasdark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one ofthe malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on pastthe dusty curtains, of which I have told you.“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which, perhaps, ascore or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt they found mysecond appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out of the quiet darkness withinarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of a match. For they hadforgotten about matches. ‘Where is my Time Machine?’ I began, bawling like anangry child, laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must havebeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened.When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing asfoolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, intrying to revive the sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylightbehaviour, I thought that fear must be forgotten.“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people over in mycourse, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out under themoonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running and stumblingthis way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon crept up the sky. Isuppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that maddened me. I felthopelessly cut off from my own kind—a strange animal in an unknown world. I musthave raved to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memoryof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in thisimpossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit ruins and touching strangecreatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinxand weeping with absolute wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then Islept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows werehopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm.“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had gotthere, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. Then thingscame clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight, I could look mycircumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight,and I could reason with myself. ‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose themachine altogether lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient,to learn the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I maymake another.’ That would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair.And, after all, it was a beautiful and curious world.“But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be calm andpatient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or cunning. And withthat I scrambled to my feet and looked about me, wondering where I could bathe.I felt weary, stiff, and travelsoiled. The freshness of the morning made medesire an equal freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went aboutmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I madea careful examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time infutile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the littlepeople as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures; some were simplystolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task inthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was a foolishimpulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger was ill curbed and stilleager to take advantage of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I founda groove ripped in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and themarks of my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like thoseI could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to thepedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block,but highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and rappedat these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found themdiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possiblythe panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing wasclear enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that myTime Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a differentproblem.“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes and undersome blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling to them andbeckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the bronze pedestal, Itried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my first gesture towards this theybehaved very oddly. I don’t know how to convey their expression to you. Supposeyou were to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is howshe would look. They went off as if they had received the last possible insult.I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same result.Somehow, this manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wantedthe Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others,my temper got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by theloose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him towards thesphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden Ilet him go.“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels, I thoughtI heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I heard a sound like achuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river,and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and theverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people must have heardme hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came ofit. I saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hotand tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long;I am too Occidental1 for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, butto wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is another matter.“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes towardsthe hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your machine againyou must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take your machine away, it’slittle good your wrecking their bronze panels, and if they don’t, you will getit back as soon as you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown thingsbefore a puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world.Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In theend you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the situationcame into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to getinto the future age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had mademyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised.Although it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud.“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people avoidedme. It may have been my fancy or it may have had something to do with myhammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of the avoidance. Iwas careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain from any pursuit ofthem, and in the course of a day or two things got back to the old footing. Imade what progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed myexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point, or theirlanguage was excessively simple—almost exclusively composed of concretesubstantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, orlittle use of figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and oftwo words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplestpropositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mysteryof the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet acertain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few milesround the point of my arrival.“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant richness asthe Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same abundance ofsplendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style, the same clusteringthickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here andthere water shone like silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulatinghills, and so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, whichpresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path up thehill, which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others, it was rimmedwith bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain.Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lightedmatch. But in all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud-thud-thud, like thebeating of some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches,that a steady current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap ofpaper into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was atonce sucked swiftly out of sight.“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing hereand there upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such a flicker inthe air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach. Putting thingstogether, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive system of subterraneanventilation, whose true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at firstinclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was anobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.“And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and bells and modesof conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this real future. Insome of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I have read, there is avast amount of detail about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. Butwhile such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is containedin one’s imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amidsuch realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a negro, freshfrom Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railwaycompanies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the ParcelsDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least, should bewilling enough to explain these things to him! And even of what he knew, howmuch could he make his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then,think how narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, andhow wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensibleof much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for ageneral impression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very little ofthe difference to your mind.“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of crematorianor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that possibly, theremight be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond the range of my explorings.This, again, was a question I deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity wasat first entirely defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was ledto make a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirmamong this people there were none.“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an automaticcivilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I could think ofno other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big palaces I had exploredwere mere living places, great dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I couldfind no machinery, no appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed inpleasant fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, thoughundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such thingsmust be made. And the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency.There were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. Theyspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making lovein a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see howthings were kept going.“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had taken itinto the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life of me I couldnot imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering pillars. I felt Ilacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, withsentences here and there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith,others made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, onthe third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and TwoThousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was watchingsome of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized withcramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran rather swiftly, butnot too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will give you an idea,therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you thatnone made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing whichwas drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly slipped off myclothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drewher safe to land. A little rubbing of limbs soon brought her round, and I hadthe satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got tosuch a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. Inthat, however, I was wrong.“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman, as Ibelieve it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an exploration, andshe received me with cries of delight and presented me with a big garland offlowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Verypossibly I had been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display myappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little stone arbour,engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affectedme exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and shekissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that hername was Weena, which though I don’t know what it meant, somehow seemedappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship which lasted aweek, and ended—as I will tell you!“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried tofollow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went to my heartto tire her down and leave her at last, exhausted and calling after me ratherplaintively. But the problems of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I saidto myself, come into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet herdistress when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting weresometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfortfrom her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. Ithought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it wastoo late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her.Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, bymerely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she caredfor me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to theneighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I wouldwatch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill.“It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the world. Shewas fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest confidence in me;for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening grimaces at her, and shesimply laughed at them. But she dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded blackthings. Darkness to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularlypassionate emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,among other things, that these little people gathered into the great housesafter dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to putthem into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or onesleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that Imissed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena’s distress I insisted uponsleeping away from these slumbering multitudes.“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me triumphed, andfor five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the last night of all, sheslept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my story slips away from me as Ispeak of her. It must have been the night before her rescue that I was awakenedabout dawn. I had been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned,and that sea-anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I wokewith a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed outof the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless anduncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping out ofdarkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up,and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front ofthe palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise.“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn weremingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black, the ground a sombregrey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the hill I thought I could seeghosts. There several times, as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. TwiceI fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly upthe hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body.They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that theyvanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand. Iwas feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. Idoubted my eyes.“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and itsvivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the view keenly.But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere creatures of thehalf-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I wonder whence they dated.’For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s2 came into my head, and amused me. If eachgeneration die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will getovercrowded with them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable someEight Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four atonce. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all themorning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated them insome indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first passionatesearch for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all thesame, they were soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of this GoldenAge. I cannot account for it. It may be the sun was hotter, or the earth nearerthe sun. It is usual to assume that the sun will go on cooling steadily in thefuture. But people, unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the youngerDarwin, forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into theparent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewedenergy; and it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whateverthe reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it.“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter from theheat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I slept and fed,there happened this strange thing: clambering among these heaps of masonry, Ifound a narrow gallery, whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen massesof stone. By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at firstimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from light toblackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. Apair of eyes, luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watchingme out of the darkness.“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my hands andsteadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to turn. Then thethought of the absolute security in which humanity appeared to be living came tomy mind. And then I remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming myfear to some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice washarsh and illcontrolled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At oncethe eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with myheart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down ina peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blunderedagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was hidden in ablack shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull white,and had strange large greyishred eyes; also that there was flaxen hair on itshead and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for me to seedistinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all-fours, or only with itsforearms held very low. After an instant’s pause I followed it into the secondheap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the profoundobscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I havetold you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Couldthis Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I sawa small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded mesteadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human spider!It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number ofmetal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then thelight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, andwhen I had lit another the little monster had disappeared.“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for some timethat I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had seen was human.But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had not remained one species,but had differentiated into two distinct animals: that my graceful children ofthe Upper-world were not the sole descendants of our generation, but that thisbleached, obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heirto all the ages.“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an undergroundventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered, wasthis Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced organization? How was itrelated to the indolent serenity of the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what washidden down there, at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the welltelling myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there Imust descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutelyafraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful Upperworld people camerunning in their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The malepursued the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran.“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned pillar,peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to remark theseapertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame a question aboutit in their tongue, they were still more visibly distressed and turned away. Butthey were interested by my matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I triedthem again about the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaningto go back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was alreadyin revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a newadjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the ventilatingtowers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning ofthe bronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came asuggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was subterranean.There were three circumstances in particular which made me think that its rareemergence above ground was the outcome of a long-continued underground lookcommon in most animals that live largely in the dark—the white fish of theKentucky caves,3 for instance. Then, those large eyes, with that capacity forreflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things—witness the owl andthe cat. And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yetfumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of thehead while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness ofthe retina.“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and thesetunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of ventilating shaftsand wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact, except along the rivervalley—showed how universal were its ramifications. What so natural, then, as toassume that it was in this artificial Under-world that such work as wasnecessary to the comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was soplausible that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the how of thissplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of mytheory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of thetruth.“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear asdaylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely temporary andsocial difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer, was the key to thewhole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque enough to you—and wildlyincredible!—and yet even now there are existing circumstances to point that way.There is a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamentalpurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, forinstance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there areunderground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply.Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had graduallylost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper intolarger and ever larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amountof its time therein, till, in the end—! Even now, does not an East-end workerlive in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the naturalsurface of the earth?“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the increasingrefinement of their education, and the widening gulf between them and the rudeviolence of the poor—is already leading to the closing, in their interest, ofconsiderable portions of the surface of the land. About London, for instance,perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this samewidening gulf—which is due to the length and expense of the higher educationalprocess and the increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habitson the part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, thatpromotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of our speciesalong lines of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty,and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to theconditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have topay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and ifthey refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them aswere so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in theend, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as well adapted tothe conditions of underground life, and as happy in their way, as theUpper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to me, the refined beauty andthe etiolated pallor followed naturally enough.4“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape in mymind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general co-operation asI had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed with a perfectedscience and working to a logical conclusion the industrial system of to-day. Itstriumph had not been simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature andthe fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had noconvenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may beabsolutely wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on thissupposition the balanced civilization that was at last attained must have longsince passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfectsecurity of the Upperworlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration,to a general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could seeclearly enough already. What had happened to the Under-grounders I did not yetsuspect; but from what I had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the by, was the nameby which these creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification ofthe human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the beautifulrace that I already knew.“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time Machine? For Ifelt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the Eloi were masters,could they not restore the machine to me? And why were they so terribly afraidof the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to question Weena about thisUnder-world, but here again I was disappointed. At first she would notunderstand my questions, and presently she refused to answer them. She shiveredas though the topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a littleharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I eversaw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about theMorlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the humaninheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and clapping herhands, while I solemnly burned a match."},{"pageContent":"VIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“IT MAY SEEM odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up thenew-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiarshrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour ofthe worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. Andthey were filthily cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due tothe sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now beganto appreciate.“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a littledisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had afeeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite reason. Iremember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people weresleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among them—and feeling reassuredby their presence. It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few daysthe moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when theappearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs,this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on boththese days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. Ifelt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldlypenetrating these underground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. Ifonly I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horriblyalone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. Idon’t know if you will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at myback.“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me further andfurther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towardsthe rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far off, in thedirection of nineteenth-century Banstead,1 a vast green structure, different incharacter from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of thepalaces or ruins I knew, and the façade had an Oriental look; the face of ithaving the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of acertain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested adifference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the day wasgrowing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiringcircuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and Ireturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning Iperceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of GreenPorcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day,an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without furtherwaste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near theruins of granite and aluminium.“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw melean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted.‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then, putting her down, Ibegan to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may aswell confess, for I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched mein amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and, running to me, she began topull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather toproceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I wasin the throat of the well. I saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiledto reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent waseffected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, andthese being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter thanmyself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simplyfatigued! One of the bars bent off into the blackness beneath. For a moment Ihung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to rest again. Thoughmy arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down thesheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw theaperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’shead showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine belowgrew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disk above wasprofoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared.“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up theshaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned this overin my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimlycoming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swingingmyself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which Icould lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back wascramped, and I was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this,the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air wasfull of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.“I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching my face.Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one,I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above groundin the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in whatappeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large andsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected thelight in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that raylessobscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light.But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently,vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me inthe strangest fashion.“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently differentfrom that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs left to my own unaidedefforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind.But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it now,’ and, feeling my way along thetunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fellaway from me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match, sawthat I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darknessbeyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one could seein the burning of a match.“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of thedimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlockssheltered from the glare. The place, by the by, was very stuffy and oppressive,and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air. Some way down thecentral vista was a little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal.The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I rememberwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw.It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, theobscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness tocome at me again! Then the match burned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, awriggling red spot in the blackness.“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such anexperience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with theabsurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely aheadof ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine,without anything to smoke—at times I missed tobacco frightfully—even withoutenough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed thatglimpse of the Under-world in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as itwas, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowedme with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that stillremained to me.“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it wasonly with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had runlow. It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need toeconomize them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing theUpper-worlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, andwhile I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling overmy face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heardthe breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt thebox of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind meplucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me wasindescribably unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their waysof thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted atthem as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel themapproaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds toeach other. I shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. Thistime they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise asthey came back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined tostrike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, andeking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket. I made good myretreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light wasblown out, and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like windamong leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking thatthey were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in theirdazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked—thosepale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared intheir blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: Iretreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It hadalmost burned through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down onthe edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I feltsideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped frombehind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match . . . and itincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kickingviolently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks and wasspeedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up atme: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and wellnigh securedmy boot as a trophy.“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of ita deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold.The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Severaltimes my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however,I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into theblinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others amongthe Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible."},{"pageContent":"VIIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“NOW, INDEED, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except during mynight’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope ofultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. HithertoI had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the littlepeople, and by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of theMorlocks—a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, Ihad felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with thepit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemywould come upon him soon.“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon.Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks aboutthe Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what thecoming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was alonger interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at leastthe reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for the dark. I wonderedvaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon.I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-worldpeople might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks theirmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species thathad resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had alreadyarrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovingian1kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earthon sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, hadcome at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made theirgarments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhapsthrough the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horsepaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancientand departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the oldorder was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones wascreeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust hisbrother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was comingback—changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They werebecoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memoryof the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how it floated into mymind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming inalmost like a question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had avague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysteriousFear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripeprime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost itsterrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay I determined tomake myself arms and a fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base,I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost inrealizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could neversleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to thinkhow they must already have examined me.“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but foundnothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings andtrees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, tojudge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of GreenPorcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in theevening, taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towardsthe southwest. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but itmust have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoonwhen distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of myshoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole—they were comfortableold shoes I wore about indoors—so that I was lame. And it was already long pastsunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the paleyellow of the sky.“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a time shedesired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionallydarting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pocketshad always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had concluded that they were aneccentric kind of vase for floral decoration. At least she utilized them forthat purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...”The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed twowithered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table.Then he resumed his narrative.“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hillcrest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house ofgrey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of GreenPorcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking arefuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon thingsbefore the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always anair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, andempty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that nightthe expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my sensesseemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness ofthe ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks ontheir anthill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In myexcitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as adeclaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine?“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clearblue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grewdim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took herin my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grewdeeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressedher face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, andthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and wentup the opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by astatue—a Faun, or some such figure, minus the head. Here too were acacias.2 Sofar I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, andthe darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and blackbefore me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right orthe left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were very sore—I carefullylowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I couldno longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction.I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Underthat dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even werethere no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my imaginationloose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-bolesto strike against.“I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that Iwould not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in myjacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hill-side wasquiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then astir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night was very clear. Ifelt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the oldconstellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which isimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them inunfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the sametattered streamer of star-dust as of yore.3 Southward (as I judged it) was avery bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our owngreen Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planetshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravitiesof terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slowinevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknownfuture. I thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earthdescribes. Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all theyears that I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations, languages,literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had beenswept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had forgottentheir high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then Ithought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the firsttime, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seenmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me,her face white and star-like under the stars, and forthwith dismissed thethought.“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, andwhiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the oldconstellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazycloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came afaintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, andthe old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtakingit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink andwarm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill thatnight. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fearhad been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollenat the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,and flung them away.“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasantinstead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break ourfast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in thesunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. And then Ithought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what itwas, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from thegreat flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human decaythe Morlocks’ food had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-likevermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food thanhe was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is nodeep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men—! I tried to look at thething in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remotethan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And theintelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Whyshould I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-likeMorlocks preserved and preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And therewas Weena dancing at my side!“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, byregarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been contentto live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had takenNecessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity hadcome home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like4 scorn of this wretchedaristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However greattheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form notto claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation andtheir Fear.“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My firstwas to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metalor stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, Ihoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torchat hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronzeunder the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering-ram. I had a persuasion thatif I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I shoulddiscover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks werestrong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to ourown time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards thebuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling."},{"pageContent":"VIIIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“I FOUND THE Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about noon,deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in itswindows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corrodedmetallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy down, and lookingnortheastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, oreven creek, where I judged Wands-worth and Battersea must once have been. Ithought then—though I never followed up the thought—of what might have happened,or might be happening, to the living things in the sea.“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, andalong the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought,rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learnedthat the bare idea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed tome, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was sohuman.“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found, insteadof the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the firstglance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and aremarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same greycovering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of thehall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized by theoblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of theMegatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, andin one place, where rainwater had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thingitself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrelof a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side Ifound what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, Ifound the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have beenair-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!1 Here,apparently, was the Palaeon-tological Section, and a very splendid array offossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had beenstaved off for a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi,lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extremesureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here andthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken topieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instancesbeen bodily removed—by the Morlocks as I judged. The place was very silent. Thethick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea-urchin downthe sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and veryquietly took my hand and stood beside me.“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of anintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Evenmy preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my mind.“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a greatdeal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology; possibly historical galleries;it might be, even a library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, thesewould be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of old-time geology indecay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to thefirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block ofsulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpeter; indeed,no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet thesulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of thecontents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved ofall I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I wenton down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered.Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything hadlong since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges ofwhat had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had onceheld spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry forthat, because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by whichthe conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we came to a gallery ofsimply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it runningdownward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered. At intervals whiteglobes hung from the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggestedthat originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in myelement, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines,all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. Youknow I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger amongthese; the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and Icould make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if Icould solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers thatmight be of use against the Morlocks.“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me.Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor ofthe gallery sloped at all.* [ch08_footnote.html#ch08fn01] The end I had come inat was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you wentdown the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last therewas a pit like the ‘area’ of a London house before each, and only a narrow lineof daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, andhad been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light,until Weena’s increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that thegallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as Ilooked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface lesseven. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number ofsmall narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocksrevived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in this academic examinationof machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in theafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making afire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiarpattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well.“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned toa machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box.Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all myweight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began towhimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snappedafter a minute’s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more thansufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed verymuch to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killingone’s own descendants! But it was impossible, some-how, to feel any humanity inthe things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if Ibegan to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained mefrom going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery andinto another and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of amilitary chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hungfrom the sides of it, I presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books.They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had leftthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps thattold the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, havemoralized upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing thatstruck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which thissombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that Ithought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen papersupon physical optics.“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a galleryof technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries.Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved.I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the reallyair-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They wereperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried toher in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horriblecreatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick softcarpeting of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind ofcomposite dance, whistling The Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. Inpart it was a modest cancan, in part a step-dance, in part a skirt-dance (so faras my tailcoat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive,as you know.“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear oftime for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunatething. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that wascamphor.2 I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been reallyhermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashedthe glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In theuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps throughmany thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seendone from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and becomefossilized millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I rememberedthat it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame—was, in fact, anexcellent candle—and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, norany means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the mosthelpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatlyelated.“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require agreat effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. Iremember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated betweenmy crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my barof iron promised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns,pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some newmetal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once havebeen had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vastarray of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earthI should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my nameupon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took myfancy.“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery aftergallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rustand lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near themodel of a tin-mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered, in anair-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed thecase with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little sidegallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waitingfive, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course thethings were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I reallybelieve that, had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently andblown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the TimeMachine, all together into nonexistence.“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within thepalace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and refreshedourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creepingupon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But thattroubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps,the best of all defences against the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphorin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thingwe could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In themorning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I hadonly my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differentlytowards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me asbeing very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequatefor the work."},{"pageContent":"* [ch08.html#ch08fn01-a] It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, butthat the museum was built into the side of a hill.—ED."},{"pageContent":"IXImage [../images/comman.jpg]“WE EMERGED FROM the palace while the sun was still in part above the horizon. Iwas determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere thedusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previousjourney. My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building afire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along Igathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of suchlitter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besidesWeena was tired. And I began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was fullnight before we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena wouldhave stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impendingcalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I hadbeen without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. Ifelt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against theirblackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass allabout us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, Icalculated, was rather less than a mile across. If we could get through it tothe bare hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether saferresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could contrive tokeep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was toflourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, ratherreluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would amaze ourfriends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of thisproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering ourretreat.“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in theabsence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is rarely strongenough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case inmore tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely givesrise to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with theheat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence,too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tonguesthat went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing toWeena.“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herselfinto it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and, in spite of herstruggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For a little way the glare ofmy fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see, through the crowdedstems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent,and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed atthat, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very black and Weenaclung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to thedarkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simplyblack, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there.I struck none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm Icarried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faintrustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of theblood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering about me. Ipushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the samequeer sound and voices I had heard in the Under-world. There were evidentlyseveral of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in anotherminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shiveredviolently, and became quite still.“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, asI fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees,perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from theMorlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touchingeven my neck. Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and sawthe white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lumpof camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match shouldwane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quitemotionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her.She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to theground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and theshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of the stirand murmur of a great company!“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose topush on, and then there came a horrible realization. In manœuvring with mymatches and Weena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had notthe faintest idea in what direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might befacing back towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a coldsweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire andencamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, andvery hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks andleaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes shonelike carbuncles.“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two whiteforms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded bythe light that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under theblow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and felldown. I lit another piece of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire.Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since myarrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, insteadof casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up anddragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood anddry sticks, and could economize my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena laybeside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like onedead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavyof a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would notneed replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary after my exertion, andsat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did notunderstand. I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and theMorlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastilyfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped andclosed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and myfire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forestseemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair,by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness tofeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrousspider’s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping atmy neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. Itgave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holdingthe bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel thesucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free.“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came uponme. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make theMorlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the ironbar before me. The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minutepassed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and theirmovements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at theblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And closeon the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous.Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—andthen I recognized, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, inan incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood infront. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, Isaw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between thebranches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, theslumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and theMorlocks’ flight.“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the blackpillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my firstfire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. Thehissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burstinto flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, Ifollowed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a close race. Once the flames creptforward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strikeoff to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so,a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into thefire!“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that Ibeheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with thereflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by ascorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, withyellow tongues already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with afence of fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled bythe light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other intheir bewilderment. At first I did not realize their blindness, and struckfuriously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me,killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures ofone of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard theirmoans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, andI struck no more of them.“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose aquivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames dieddown somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to seeme. I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before thisshould happen; but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. Iwalked about the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace ofWeena. But Weena was gone.“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strangeincredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noisesto each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush ofsmoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy,remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Twoor three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of myfists, trembling as I did so.“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bitmyself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with myhands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again satdown. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake.Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into theflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streamingmasses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and thediminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain thatthey had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how itrelieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemeddestined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of thehelpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I havesaid, was a kind of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make outthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could getmy bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damnedsouls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, Itied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among blackstems, that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of theTime Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, andI felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. Itseemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more likethe sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left meabsolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine,of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that waspain.“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made adiscovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must haveleaked before it was lost."},{"pageContent":"XImage [../images/comman.jpg]“ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow metal fromwhich I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival. I thought of myhasty conclusions upon that evening and could not refrain from laughing bitterlyat my confidence. Here was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage,the same splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river runningbetween its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hitherand thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I hadsaved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like blots uponthe landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understoodnow what all the beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant wastheir day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the cattle,they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And their end was thesame.“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been. It hadcommitted suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and ease, abalanced society with security and permanency as its watchword, it had attainedits hopes—to come to this at last. Once, life and property must have reachedalmost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, thetoiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there hadbeen no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiethad followed.“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is thecompensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in harmonywith its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never appeals tointelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no intelligencewhere there is no change and no need of change. Only those animals partake ofintelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.“So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his feeble prettiness,and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry. But that perfect state hadlacked one thing even for mechanical perfection—absolute permanency. Apparentlyas time went on, the feeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, hadbecome disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousandyears, came back again, and she began below. The Under-world being in contactwith machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought outsidehabit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative, if less of everyother human character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, theyturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it in my lastview of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One. Itmay be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit could invent. It is how the thingshaped itself to me, and as that I give it to you.“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite ofmy grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were verypleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorizing passed intodozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading myself outupon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep.“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being caughtnapping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill towardsthe White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other hand played withthe matches in my pocket.“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of thesphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into grooves.“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this wasthe Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here, after all myelaborate preparation for the siege of the White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. Ithrew my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it.“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal. For once,at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks. Suppressing a stronginclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze frame and up to the TimeMachine. I was surprised to find it had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I havesuspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces whiletrying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.“Now as I stood and examined it, finding pleasure in the mere touch of thecontrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels suddenly slidup and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark—trapped. So the Morlocksthought. At that I chuckled gleefully.“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me. Verycalmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and departthen like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The matches were ofthat abominable kind that light only on the box.“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close upon me.One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them with the levers, andbegan to scramble into the saddle of the machine. Then came one hand upon me andthen another. Then I had simply to fight against their persistent fingers for mylevers, and at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to buttin the dark with my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. Itwas a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last scramble.“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands slippedfrom me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found myself in the samegrey light and tumult I have already described."},{"pageContent":"XIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“I HAVE ALREADY told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with timetravelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sidewaysand in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as itswayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself tolook at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dialrecords days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, andanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers, I hadpulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I came to look at theseindicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as theseconds hand of a watch—into futurity.“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. Thepalpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still travelling withprodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and night, which was usuallyindicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. Thispuzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower andslower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed tostretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, atwilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky.The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for thesun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broaderand more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last,some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless uponthe horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering amomentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed morebrilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceivedby this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal dragwas done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in ourown time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my formerheadlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circlinghands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longera mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolatebeach grew visible.“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky wasno longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shonebrightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian redand starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where,cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocksabout me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I couldsee at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projectingpoint on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees onforest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in aperpetual twilight.“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to thesouth-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There wereno breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slightoily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternalsea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimesbroke was a thick incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was asense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast.The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from thatI judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now.“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like ahuge white butterfly1 go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling,disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismalthat I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round meagain, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock wasmoving slowly towards me.Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imaginea crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly anduncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennae, like carters’ whips,waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of itsmetallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, anda greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palpsof its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a ticklingon my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it away with myhand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately came another by myear. I struck at this, and caught something thread-like. It was drawn swiftlyout of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had graspedthe antenna of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyeswere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and itsvast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending upon me. In amoment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself andthese monsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly nowas soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, inthe sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the world.The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea, the stony beachcrawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the uniform poisonous-lookinggreen of the lichenous plants, the thin air that hurts one’s lungs: allcontributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there wasthe same red sun—a little larger, a little duller—the same dying sea, the samechill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among thegreen weed and the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale linelike a vast new moon.“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand yearsor more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate, watching with a strangefascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky, and the life ofthe old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million years hence, the hugered-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darklingheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs haddisappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me.Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, theglare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see anundulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along thesea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse of that saltocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen.“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certainindefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I sawnothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks alonetestified that life was not extinct. A shallow sandbank had appeared in the seaand the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I saw some black objectflopping about upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and Ijudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was merely arock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinklevery little.“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had changed;that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this grow larger. Fora minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that was creeping over theday, and then I realized that an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or theplanet Mercury was passing across the sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took itto be the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I reallysaw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the earth.“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from theeast, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number. From theedge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds theworld was silent. Silent? It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. Allthe sounds of man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum ofinsects, the stir that makes the background of our lives—all that was over. Asthe darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before myeyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, oneafter the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness.The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipsesweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. Allelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my marrow,and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a deadly nauseaseized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. Igot off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing thereturn journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing uponthe shoal—there was no mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the redwater of the sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, itmay be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against theweltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I wasfainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awfultwilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle."},{"pageContent":"XIIImage [../images/comman.jpg]“SO I CAME BACK. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the machine.The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed, the sun got goldenagain, the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom. The fluctuating contoursof the land ebbed and flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last Isaw again the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These,too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial wasat zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize our own petty and familiararchitecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night andday flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the laboratory came roundme. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism down.“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that whenI set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had walked acrossthe room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I returned, I passedagain across that minute when she traversed the laboratory. But now her everymotion appeared to be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at thelower end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, anddisappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just beforethat I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a flash.“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar laboratory,my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the thing veryshakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes I trembled violently.Then I became calmer. Around me was my old workshop again, exactly as it hadbeen. I might have slept there, and the whole thing have been a dream.“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of thelaboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the wall whereyou saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my little lawn to thepedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through thepassage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling sorelybegrimed. I saw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I found the datewas indeed to-day, and looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eighto’clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt sosick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you.You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely incredibleto you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here to-night in this oldfamiliar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these strangeadventures.”He looked at the Medical Man. “No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it asa lie—or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have beenspeculating upon the destinies of our race until I have hatched this fiction.Treat my assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest.And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap with itnervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary stillness. Thenchairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet. I took my eyes offthe Time Traveller’s face, and looked round at his audience. They were in thedark, and little spots of colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemedabsorbed in the contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at theend of his cigar—the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, asfar as I remember, were motionless.The Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer ofstories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s shoulder.“You don’t believe it?”“Well—”“I thought not.”The Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He lit oneand spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth . . . I hardly believeit myself.... And yet ...”His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon the littletable. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw he was lookingat some half-healed scars on his knuckles.The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “Thegynaeceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see, holding outhis hand for a specimen.“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How shall weget home?”“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist.“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t know thenatural order of these flowers. May I have them?”The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man.The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was trying tokeep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my pocket by Weena,when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room. “I’m damned if it isn’tall going. This room and you and the atmosphere of every day is too much for mymemory. Did I ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is itall only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but Ican’t stand another that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream comefrom? . . . I must look at that machine. If there is one!”He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the doorinto the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light of the lampwas the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew; a thing of brass, ebony,ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid to the touch—for I put out myhand and felt the rail of it—and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, andbits of grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand along thedamaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I told you was true. I’msorry to have brought you out here in the cold.” He took up the lamp, and, in anabsolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room.He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat. TheMedical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him he wassuffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I remember him standing inthe open doorway, bawling good night.I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For my ownpart I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so fantastic andincredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake most of the nightthinking about it. I determined to go next day and see the Time Traveller again.I was told he was in the laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, Iwent up to him. The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at theTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squatsubstantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instabilitystartled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days whenI used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The TimeTraveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had asmall camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when hesaw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “withthat thing in there.”“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. Hiseye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,” he said. “I know whyyou came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s some magazines here. If you’llstop to lunch I’ll prove you this time travelling up to the hilt, specimen andall. If you’ll forgive my leaving you now?”I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and henodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the laboratory slam,seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper. What was he going to dobefore lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded by an advertisement that I hadpromised to meet Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, andsaw that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the passageto tell the Time Traveller.As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly truncatedat the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round me as I openedthe door, and from within came the sound of broken glass falling on the floor.The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figuresitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment—a figure sotransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was absolutelydistinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine hadgone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory wasempty. A pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in.I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had happened,and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange thing might be. As Istood staring, the door into the garden opened, and the man-servant appeared.We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr.——gone out that way?”said I.“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him here.”At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on,waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still strangerstory, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I ambeginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanishedthree years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEImage [../images/comman.jpg]ONE CANNOT choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he swept backinto the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age ofUnpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesquesaurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if Imay use the phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef,or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward,into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles ofour own time answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of therace: for I, for my own part, cannot think that these latter days of weakexperiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminatingtime! I say, for my own part. He, I know—for the question had been discussedamong us long before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of theAdvancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilization only afoolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers inthe end.

I read this wonderful novel when I was a boyand it immediately became one of my favorite books. Yet when I revisited it asan adult, I was surprised to find I didn’t feel that same rush of emotion.I realized that part of the reason I was so taken with the book as a boy is thatI actually believed a time machine could exist and that one day perhaps I couldalso travel into the future. That must have been how Well’s contemporaries felt,since science was taking such a grand leap forward in the nineteenth century andanything seemed possible. Travel into the future? Beyond the frame of our normalexistence? To see things not destined for our eyes? And that’s when I felt thattingle writers feel when they find a story with possibilities. I couldn’t getthe image out of my head and that’s when I knew I had found the seed ofinspiration for a novel of my own.I wanted to create a fast-paced novel filled with love and adventure, one thatwould speak to the ways that imagination can save lives, a book that spoke tothe nature of time, which, after all, defines who and what we are.

IANDREW HARRINGTON WOULD HAVE GLADLY died several times over if that meant nothaving to choose just one pistol from among his father’s vast collection in theliving room cabinet. Decisions had never been Andrew’s strong point. On closeexamination, his life had been a series of mistaken choices, the last of themthreatening to cast its lengthy shadow over the future. But that life ofunedifying blunders was about to end. This time he was sure he had made theright decision, because he had decided not to decide. There would be no moremistakes in the future because there would be no more future. He was going todestroy it completely by putting one of those guns to his right temple. He couldsee no other solution: obliterating the future was the only way for him toeradicate the past.He scanned the contents of the cabinet, the lethal assortment his father hadlovingly set about assembling after his return from the war. He was fanaticalabout these weapons, though Andrew suspected it was not so much nostalgia thatdrove him to collect them as his desire to contemplate the novel ways mankindkept coming up with for taking one’s own life outside the law. In stark contrastto his father’s devotion, Andrew was impassive as he surveyed the apparentlydocile, almost humdrum implements that had brought thunder down to men’sfingertips and freed war from the unpleasantness of hand-to-hand combat. Andrewtried to imagine what kind of death might be lurking inside each of them, lyingin wait like some predator. Which would his father have recommended he blow hisbrains out with? He calculated that death from one of those antiquatedmuzzle-loading flintlocks, which had to be refilled with gunpowder and a ball,then tamped down with a paper plug each time they were fired, would be a noblebut drawn-out, tedious affair. He preferred the swift death guaranteed by one ofthe more modern revolvers nestling in their luxurious velvet-lined wooden cases.He considered a Colt Single Action revolver, which looked easy to handle andreliable, but discarded it when he remembered he had seen Buffalo Billbrandishing one in his Wild West Shows. A pitiful attempt to reenact histransoceanic exploits with a handful of imported Red Indians and a dozenlethargic, apparently opium-drugged buffalo. Death for him was not just anotheradventure. He also rejected a fine Smith & Wesson: that was the gun that hadkilled the outlaw Jesse James, of whom he considered himself unworthy, as wellas a Webley revolver, specially designed to hold back the charging hordes inBritain’s colonial wars, which he thought looked too cumbersome. His attentionturned next to his father’s favorite, a fine pepperbox with rotating barrels,but he seriously doubted whether this ridiculous, ostentatious-looking weaponwould be capable of firing a bullet with enough force. Finally, he settled on anelegant 1870 Colt with mother-of-pearl inlays that would take his life with allthe delicacy of a woman’s caress.He smiled defiantly as he plucked it from the cabinet, remembering how often hisfather had forbidden him to meddle with his pistols. But the illustrious WilliamHarrington was in Italy at that moment, no doubt reducing the Fontana de Trevito a quivering wreck with his critical gaze. His parents” decision to leave ontheir trip to Europe the very day he had chosen to kill himself had also been ahappy coincidence. He doubted whether either of them would ever decipher thetrue message concealed in his gesture (that he had preferred to die as he hadlived—alone), but for Andrew it was enough to imagine the inevitable look ofdisgust on his father’s face when he discovered his son had killed himselfbehind his back, without his permission.He opened the cabinet where the ammunition was kept and loaded six bullets intothe chamber. He supposed that one would be enough, but who knew what mighthappen. After all, he had never killed himself before. Then he tucked the gun,wrapped in a cloth, inside his coat pocket, as though it were a piece of fruithe was taking with him to eat later on a stroll. In a further act of defiance,he left the cabinet door open. If only he had shown this much courage before, hethought. If only he had dared confront his father when it had mattered, shewould still be alive. But by the time he did, it was too late. And he had spenteight long years paying for his hesitation. Eight years, during which his painhad only worsened, spreading its slimy tendrils through him like poison ivy,wrapping itself around his insides, gnawing at his soul. Despite the efforts ofhis cousin Charles and the distraction of other women’s bodies, his grief overMarie’s death refused to be laid to rest. But tonight it would all be over.Twenty-six was a good age to die, he reflected, contentedly fingering the bulgein his pocket. He had the gun. Now all he needed was a suitable place to performthe ceremony. And there was only one possible place.With the weight of the revolver in his pocket comforting him like a good- luckcharm, he descended the grand staircase of the Harrington mansion in elegantKensington Gore, a stone’s throw from the Queen’s Gate entrance to Hyde Park. Hehad not intended to cast any farewell glances at the walls of what had been hishome for almost three decades, but he could not help feeling a perverse wish topause before his father’s portrait, which dominated the hall. His father stareddown at him disapprovingly out of the gilt frame, a proud and commanding figurebursting out of the old uniform he had worn as a young infantryman in theCrimean War until a Russian bayonet had punctured his thigh and left him with adisturbingly lopsided gait. William Harrington surveyed the world disdainfully,as though the universe were a botched affair on which he had long since givenup. What fool was responsible for that untimely blanket of fog which haddescended on the battlefield outside the besieged city of Sebastopol, so thatnobody could see the tip of the enemy’s bayonets? Who had decided that a womanwas the ideal person to preside over England’s destiny? Was the East really thebest place for the sun to rise? Andrew had never seen his father without thatcruel animosity seeping from his eyes, and so could not know whether he had beenborn with it or had been infected with it fighting alongside the ferociousOttomans in the Crimea. But in any event, it had not vanished like a mild caseof smallpox, leaving no mark on his face, even though the path that had openedup in front of his hapless soldier’s boots on his return could only be termed afortunate one. What did it matter that he had to hobble along it with the aid ofa stick if it helped him reach his present position? For, without having toenter any pact with the Devil, the man with the bushy moustache and clean-cutfeatures depicted on the canvas had become one of the richest men in Englandovernight. Trudging around in that distant war, bayonet at the ready, he couldnever have dreamed of possessing a fraction of what he now owned. How he hadamassed his fortune though, was one of the family’s best-kept secrets, and acomplete mystery to Andrew.THE TEDIOUS MOMENT IS now approaching when the young man must decide which hatand overcoat to pick from among the heap in the hall closet: one has to lookpresentable even for death. This is a scene which, knowing Andrew, could takeseveral exasperating minutes, and since I see no need to describe it, I shalltake the opportunity to welcome you to this tale, which has just begun, andwhich after lengthy reflection I chose to begin at this juncture and notanother; as though I, too, had to select a single beginning from among the manyjostling for position in the closet of possibilities. Assuming you stay untilthe end of this tale, some of you will no doubt think that I chose the wrongthread with which to begin spinning my yarn, and that for accuracy’s sake Ishould have respected chronological order and begun with Miss Haggerty’s story.It is possible, but there are stories that cannot begin at their beginning, andperhaps this is one of them.So, let’s forget about Miss Haggerty for the moment, forget that I evermentioned her, even, and let’s go back to Andrew, who has just stepped forthfrom the mansion suitably dressed in a hat and coat, and even a pair of warmgloves to protect his hands from the harsh winter cold. Once outside themansion, the young man paused at the top of the steps, which unfurled at hisfeet like a wave of marble down to the garden. From there, he surveyed the worldin which he had been brought up, suddenly aware that, if things went accordingto plan, he would never see it again. Night was gently spreading its veil overthe Harrington mansion. A hazy full moon hung in the sky, bathing in its softglow the immaculate lawns surrounding the house, most of them cluttered withflower beds, hedges, and fountains, dozens of oversized stone fountainsdecorated with excessively ornate sculptures of mermaids, fauns, and othermythical creatures. His father had accumulated such a large number of thembecause as an unsophisticated soul his only way of showing off his importancewas to buy a lot of expensive and useless objects. In the case of the fountainshis extravagance was excusable, because they combined to soothe the night withtheir watery refrain, making the listener want to close his eyes and forgeteverything except the sound of that hypnotic burble. Further off, beyond theneatly clipped lawns, stood the immense greenhouse, graceful as a swan poisedfor flight, where his mother spent most of the day marveling over the exoticflowers that sprouted from seeds brought back from the colonies.Andrew gazed at the moon for several minutes wondering whether man would ever beable to travel there, as had the characters in Jules Verne and Cyrano deBergerac’s works. And what would he find if he did manage to land on itsshimmering surface—whether in an airship or shot out of a cannon or with a dozenbottles of dew strapped to his body in the hope that when it evaporated he wouldfloat up to the sky like the Gascon swashbuckler’s hero? Ariosto the poet hadturned the planet into a warehouse where lunatics” reason was stored in vials,but Andrew was more drawn to Plutarch’s idea of it as the place where noblesouls went after they left the world of the living. Like Plutarch, Andrewpreferred to imagine that the moon was where dead people dwelled. He liked topicture them living at peace in ivory palaces built by an army of worker angelsor in caves dug out of that white rock, waiting for the living to meet death andto carry on their lives there with them, exactly where they had left off.Sometimes, he imagined that Marie was living at that very moment in one of thosegrottos, oblivious to what had happened to her and grateful that death hadoffered her a better existence than life. Marie, pale in all that whitesplendor, waiting patiently for him to decide once and for all to blow hisbrains out and come to fill the empty space in her bed.He stopped gazing at the moon when he noticed that Harold, the coachman, hadfollowed his orders and was standing at the foot of the stairs with a carriageat the ready. As soon as he saw his young master descending the flight of steps,the coachman rushed to open the carriage door. Andrew had always been amused byHarold’s display of energy, considering it incongruous in a man approachingsixty, but the coachman clearly kept in good shape.“Miller’s Court,” the youth commanded.Harold was astonished at his request.“But sir, that’s where—”“Is there some problem, Harold?” Andrew interrupted.The coachman stared at him for a moment, his mouth hanging ludicrouslyhalf-open, before adding:“None whatsoever, sir.”Andrew gave a nod, signaling that the conversation was at an end. He climbedinto the brougham and sat down on the red velvet seat. Glimpsing his reflectionin the carriage window, Andrew gave a sigh of despair. Was that haggardcountenance really his? It was the face of someone whose life has been seepingout of him unawares, like a pillow losing its stuffing through an open seam. Ina certain sense, this was true. Although his face retained the harmonious goodlooks he was fortunate enough to have been born with, it now resembled an emptyshell, a vague impression left in a mound of ashes. The sorrow that had cast ashadow over his soul had taken its toll on his appearance, too, for he couldscarcely recognize himself in this aging youth with hollowed cheeks, downcasteyes, and an unkempt beard who stared back at him in the glass. Grief hadstunted him, transforming him into a dried-up, sullen creature. Fortunately, thecab began to rock as Harold, having overcome his astonishment, clambered up tohis perch. This took Andrew’s attention away from the blurred face sketched ontothe canvas of the night. The final act of the disastrous performance that hadbeen his life was about to begin, and he was determined to savor every moment ofit. He heard the whip crack above his head and, caressing the steely bulge inhis pocket, he let himself be lulled by the carriage’s gentle sway.THE CARRIAGE LEFT THE mansion and drove down Carriage Drive, which bordered thelush vegetation of Hyde Park. Gazing through the window at the city, Andrewthought that in less than half an hour’s time they would be in the East End.This ride had always fascinated and puzzled him in equal measure, because itallowed him to glimpse in a single sweep every aspect of his beloved London, theworld’s greatest metropolis, the giant head of an insatiable octopus whosetentacles stretched over almost a fifth of the world’s surface, holding Canada,India, Australia, and a large part of Africa in its viselike grip. As thehandsome cab sped east, the salubrious, almost countrified atmosphere ofKensington soon gave way to the crowded urban environment of Piccadilly, andbeyond to the Circus where Anteros, the avenger of unrequited love, protrudeslike an arrow fired at the city’s heart. Beyond Fleet Street, the middle-classdwellings seemingly huddled around St. Paul’s Cathedral gradually came intoview. Finally, once they had passed the Bank of England and Cornhill Street, awave of poverty swept over everything, a poverty that people from the adjoiningWest End knew of only from the satirical cartoons in Punch, and which seemed topollute the air, making it foul to breathe as it mingled with the stench risingfrom the Thames.Andrew had last made this journey eight years earlier, and since then he hadalways known that sooner or later he would make it again for the very last time.It was hardly surprising then that as they drew nearer to Aldgate, the gatewayto Whitechapel, he felt slightly uneasy. He gazed warily out of the window asthey entered the district, experiencing the same misgivings as he had in thepast. He had never been able to avoid feeling overwhelmed by an uncomfortablesense of shame knowing that he was spying on what was to him an alien world withthe dispassionate interest of somebody who studies insects. Although over timehis initial revulsion had turned into inevitable compassion for the souls whoinhabited that junkyard where the city dumped its human waste. And, peering outof the window, it seemed as if there was every reason for him to feel thatcompassion still: London’s poorest borough had changed relatively little in thepast eight years. Wealth brings poverty in its wake, thought Andrew as theycrossed the ill-lit, rowdy streets, crammed with stalls and handcarts andteeming with wretched creatures whose lives were played out beneath the menacingshadow of Christ Church. At first, he had been shocked to discover that behindthe dazzle of the city’s facade there existed this outpost of hell where, withthe Queen’s blessing, human beings were condemned to live like beasts. But theintervening years had made him less naive, so that he was no longer surprised tosee that even as the advances of science were transforming the face of Londonand the well-to-do amused themselves by recording their dogs” barks onto thewax-coated cylinders of phonographs or conversed via telephone under the glow ofRobertson’s electric lamps, while their wives brought their children into theworld still groggy from chloroform, Whitechapel had remained immune to all thisprogress, untouchable beneath its rotten shell, drowning in its own filth. Aquick glance was enough to tell him that crossing into this world was still likesticking his hand into a hornets” nest. It was here that poverty showed itsugliest face, here the same jarring, sinister tune was always playing. Heobserved a couple of pub brawls, heard screams rising from the depths of darkalleyways, and glimpsed a few drunks sprawled in the gutter while gangs ofstreet urchins stripped them of their shoes. They exchanged glances with a pairof pugnacious-looking men standing on street corners, the petty rulers in thisparallel kingdom of vice and crime.THE LUXURIOUS CARRIAGE CAUGHT the attention of several prostitutes who shoutedlewd proposals to him, hitching up their skirts and showing their cleavage.Andrew felt a pang of sorrow as he gazed upon this pitiful back-streetspectacle. Most of the women were filthy and downtrodden, their bodies bearingthe mark of their daily burden. Even the youngest and prettiest could not escapebeing stained by the misery of their surroundings. He was revisited by theagonizing thought that he might have saved one of these doomed women, offeredher a better life than the one her Creator had allotted her, and yet he hadfailed. His sorrow reached a crescendo as the carriage rattled past the TenBells, emitting an arpeggio of creaks as it turned into Crispin Street on itsway to Dorset Street, passing in front of the Britannia pub where he had firstspoken to Marie. This street was his final destination. Harold pulled thecarriage up next to the stone arch leading to the Miller’s Court flats, andclimbed off the perch to open the carriage door. Andrew stepped out of the coachfeeling suddenly dizzy and was aware that his legs were shaking as he lookedaround him. Everything was exactly as he remembered it, down to the shop withgrimy windows run by McCarthy, the owner of the flats which stood beside theentrance. Nothing he saw indicated to him that time also passed in Whitechapel.“You can go home now, Harold,” he told the coachman, who was standing in silenceat his side.“What time shall I fetch you, sir?” asked the old man.Andrew looked at him without knowing what to say. Fetch him? He had to stifle asinister laugh. The only thing fetching him would be the cart from the GoldenLane morgue, the same one that had come there to fetch what was left of hisbeloved Marie eight years before.“Forget you ever brought me here,” was his reply.The somber expression that clouded the coachman’s face moved Andrew. Had Haroldunderstood what he had come there to do? He could not be sure, because he hadnever given a moment’s thought to the coachman’s intelligence, or indeed to thatof any servant. He always thought that at the most they possessed the innatecunning of people who from an early age are obliged to swim against the currentin which he and his class maneuvered with ease. Now though he thought hedetected in old Harold’s attitude an uneasiness that could only have come fromhis having guessed Andrew’s intentions with astonishing accuracy. And theservant’s capacity for deduction was not the only discovery An drew made duringthat brief moment when for once they looked directly at each other. Andrew alsobecame aware of something hitherto unimaginable to him: the affection a servantcan feel for his master. Despite the fact that he could only see them as shadowsdrifting in and out of rooms according to some invisible design, only noticingthem when he needed to leave his glass on a tray or wanted the fire lit, thesephantoms could actually care about what happened to their masters. Thatsuccession of faceless people—the maids whom his mother dismissed on theflimsiest grounds, the cooks systematically impregnated by the stable boys asthough conforming to some ancient ritual, the butlers who left their employ withexcellent references and went to work at another mansion identical to theirs—allof them made up a shifting landscape which Andrew had never taken the trouble tonotice.“Very well, sir,” murmured Harold.Andrew understood that these words were the coachman’s last farewell; that thiswas the old fellow’s only way of saying goodbye to him, since embracing him wasa risk he appeared unwilling to take. And with a heavy heart, Andrew watchedthat stout, resolute man almost three times his age, to whom he would have hadto relinquish the role of master if they had ever been stranded together on adesert island, clamber back up onto the carriage. He urged on the horses,leaving behind an echo of hooves clattering into the distance as the carriagewas swallowed up by the fog spreading through the London streets like muddyfoam. It struck him as odd that the only person he had said good-bye to beforekilling himself should be the coachman and not his parents or his cousinCharles, but life was full of such ironies.That is exactly what Harold Barker was thinking as he drove the horses downDorset Street, looking for the way out of that accursed neighborhood where lifewas not worth thruppence. But for his father’s determination to pluck him frompoverty and secure him a job as a coachman as soon as he was able to climb ontothe perch, he might have been one more among the hordes of wretched soulsscraping an existence in this gangrenous patch of London. Yes, that surly olddrunk was the one who had hurled him into a series of jobs that had ended at thecoach house of the illustrious William Harrington, in whose service he had spenthalf his life. But, he had to admit, they had been peaceful years, which he didwhen taking stock of his life in the early hours after his chores were done andthe masters were already asleep; peaceful years in which he had taken a wife andfathered two healthy, strong children, one of whom was employed as a gardener byMr. Harrington. The good fortune that had allowed him to forge a different lifefrom the one he had believed was his lot enabled him to look upon those wretchedsouls with a degree of objectivity and compassion. Harold had been obliged to goto Whitechapel more often than he would have liked when ferrying his masterthere that terrible autumn eight years ago, a period when even the sky seemed toooze blood at times. He had read in the newspapers about what had happened inthat warren of godforsaken streets, but more than anything he had seen itreflected in his master’s eyes. He knew now that young master Harrington hadnever recovered, that those reckless excursions to pubs and brothels which hiscousin Charles had dragged them both on (although he himself had been obliged toremain in the carriage shivering from cold) had not succeeded in driving theterror from his eyes. And that night Harrington had appeared ready to lay downhis arms, to surrender to an enemy who had proved invincible. Didn’t that bulgein his pocket look suspiciously like a firearm? But what could he do? Should heturn around and try to stop him? Should a servant step in to alter his master’sdestiny? Barker shook his head. Maybe he was imagining things, he thought, andthe young man simply wanted to spend the night in that haunted room, safe with agun in his pocket.He left off his uncomfortable broodings when he glimpsed a familiar carriagecoming out of the fog towards him from the opposite direction. It was theWinslow family carriage, and the bundled-up figure on the perch was almostcertainly Edward Rush, one of their coachmen. To judge from the way he slowedthe horses, Rush appeared to have recognized him, too. Harold nodded a silentgreeting to his colleague, before directing his gaze at the occupant of thecarriage. For a split second, he and young Charles Winslow stared solemnly atone another. They did not say a word.“Faster, Edward,” Charles ordered his driver, tapping the roof of the carriagefrantically with the knob of his cane.Harold watched with relief as the carriage vanished once more into the fog inthe direction of the Miller’s Court flats. He was not needed now. He only hopedthat young Winslow arrived in time. He would have liked to stay and see how theaffair ended, but he had an order to carry out—although he fancied it had beengiven to him by a dead man—and so he urged the horses on once more and found hisway out of that dreaded neighborhood where life (I apologize for the repetition,but the same thought did occur to Harold twice) was not worth thruppence.Admittedly, the expression sums up the peculiarity of the neighborhood veryaccurately, and we probably could not hope for a more profound appraisal from acoachman. However, despite having a life worthy of being recounted—as are alllives upon close scrutiny—the coachman Barker is not a relevant character inthis story. Others may choose to write about it and will no doubt find plenty ofmaterial to endow it with the emotion every good story requires—the time he metRebecca, his wife, or the hilarious incident involving a ferret and a rake— butthat is not our purpose here.And so let us leave Harold, whose reappearance at some point in this tale Icannot vouch for, because a whole host of characters are going to pass throughit and I can’t be expected to remember every one of their faces. Let us returnto Andrew, who at this very moment is crossing the arched entrance to Miller’sCourt and walking up the muddy stone path trying to find number thirteen whilehe rummages in his coat pocket for the key. After stumbling around in the darkfor a few moments he found the room, pausing before the door with an attitudewhich anybody able to see him from one of the neighboring windows would havetaken to be incongruous reverence. But for Andrew that room was infinitely morethan some wretched lair where people who hadn’t a penny to their name tookrefuge. He had not been back there since that fateful night, although he hadpaid to keep everything exactly as it had been, exactly as it still was insidehis head. Every month for the past eight years he had sent one of his servantsto pay the rent for the little room so that nobody would be able to live there,because if he ever went back there, he did not want to find traces of anyone butMarie. The few pennies for the rent were a drop in the ocean for him, and Mr.McCarthy had been delighted that a wealthy gentleman and obvious rake shouldwant to rent that hovel indefinitely, for after what had taken place within itsfour walls he very much doubted anybody would be brave enough to sleep there.Andrew realized now that deep down he had always known he would come back, thatthe ceremony he was about to perform could not have been carried out anywhereelse.He opened the door and cast a mournful gaze around the room. It was a tinyspace, scarcely more sophisticated than a barn, with flaking walls and a fewsticks of battered furniture including a dilapidated bed, a grimy mirror, acrumbling fireplace, and a couple of chairs which looked as if they might fallapart if a fly landed on them. He felt a renewed sense of amazement that lifecould actually take place in somewhere like this. And yet, had he not known morehappiness in that room than in the luxurious setting of the Harrington mansion?If, as he had read somewhere, every man’s paradise was in a different place, hiswas undoubtedly here, a place he had reached guided by a map not charting riversor valleys but kisses and caresses.And it was precisely a caress, this time an icy one on the nape of his neck,which drew his attention to the fact that nobody had taken the trouble to fixthe broken window to the left of the door. What was the point? McCarthy seemedto belong to that class of people whose motto was to work as little as possible,and had Andrew reproached him for not replacing the pane of glass, he couldalways have argued that since he had requested everything be kept just as it washe had assumed this included the window-pane. Andrew sighed. He could seenothing with which to plug the hole, and so decided to kill himself in his hatand coat. He sat down on one of the rickety chairs, reached into his pocket forthe gun, and carefully unfolded the cloth, as if he were performing a liturgy.The Colt gleamed in the moonlight filtering weakly through the small, grimywindow.He stroked the weapon as though it were a cat curled up in his lap and letMarie’s smile wash over him once more. Andrew was always surprised that hismemories retained the vibrancy, like fresh roses, of those first days. Heremembered everything so incredibly vividly, as though no eight-year gapstretched between them, and at times these memories seemed even more beautifulthan the real events. What mysterious alchemy could make these imitations appearmore vivid than the real thing? The answer was obvious: the passage of time,which transformed the volatile present into that finished, unalterable paintingcalled the past, a canvas man always executed blindly, with erratic brushstrokesthat only made sense when one stepped far enough away from it to be able toadmire it as a whole. IITHE FIRST TIME THEIR EYES MET, SHE WAS not even there. Andrew had fallen in lovewith Marie without needing to have her in front of him, and to him this felt asromantic as it did paradoxical. The event had occurred at his uncle’s mansion inQueen’s Gate, opposite the Natural History Museum, a place Andrew had alwaysthought of as his second home. He and his cousin were the same age and hadalmost grown up together; to the point where the servants sometimes forgot whichof them was their employer’s son. And, as is easily imaginable, their affluentsocial position had spared them any hardship and misfortune, exposing them onlyto the pleasant side of life, which they immediately mistook for one long partywhere everything was apparently permissible. They moved on from sharing toys tosharing teenage conquests, and from there, curious to see how far they couldstretch the seeming impunity they enjoyed, to devising different ways of testingthe limits of what was acceptable. Their elaborate indiscretions and more orless immoral behavior were so perfectly coordinated that for years it had beendifficult not to see them as one person. This was partly down to their sharingthe complicity of twins, but also to their arrogant approach to life and even totheir physical similarity. Both boys were lean and sinewy, and possessed thesort of angelic good looks that made it almost impossible to refuse themanything. This was especially true of women, as was amply demonstrated duringtheir time in Cambridge, where they established a record number of conquestsunmatched to this day. Their habit of visiting the same tailors and hat makersadded the finishing touch to that unnerving resemblance, a likeness it seemedwould go on forever, until one day, without any warning, as though God hadresolved to compensate for his lack of creativity, that wild, two-headed,creature they formed suddenly split into two distinct halves. Andrew turned intoa pensive, taciturn young man, while Charles went on perfecting the frivolousbehavior of his adolescence. This change did not however alter their friendshiprooted in kinship. Far from driving them apart, this unexpected divergence intheir characters made them complement one another. Charles’s devil-may-careattitude found its counterpart in the refined melancholy of his cousin, for whomsuch a whimsical approach to life was no longer satisfying. Charles observedwith a wry smile Andrew’s attempts to give his life some meaning, wanderingaround secretly disillusioned, waiting for a sudden flash of inspiration thatnever came. Andrew, in turn, looked on amused at his cousin’s insistence onbehaving like a brash, shallow youth, even though some of his gestures andopinions betrayed a mind as disappointed as his own, despite his seemingunwillingness to give up enjoying what he had. Charles lived intensely, asthough he could not get enough of life’s pleasures, whereas Andrew could sit ina corner for hours, watching a rose wilt in his hands.The month of August when it all happened, they had both just turned eighteen,and although neither showed any signs of settling down, they both sensed thislife of leisure could not go on much longer, that sooner or later their parentswould lose patience with this unproductive indolence and find them positions forthem in one of the family firms. Though in the meantime they were enjoyingseeing how much longer they could get away with it. Charles was already going tothe office occasionally in the mornings to attend to minor business, but Andrewpreferred to wait until his boredom became so unbearable that taking care offamily business would seem like a relief rather than a prison sentence. Afterall, his older brother Anthony already fulfilled their father’s expectationssufficiently enough to allow the illustrious William Harrington to consent tohis second son pursuing his career of black sheep for a couple more years,provided he did not stray from his sight. But Andrew had strayed. He had strayeda long way. And now he intended to stray even further, until he disappearedcompletely, beyond all redemption.But let us not get sidetracked by melodrama. Let’s carry on with our story.Andrew had dropped in at the Winslow mansion that August afternoon so that heand his cousin Charles could arrange a Sunday outing with the charming Kellersisters. As usual, they would take them to that little grassy knoll carpetedwith flowers near the Serpentine, in Hyde Park, where they invariably mountedtheir amorous offensives. But Charles was still sleeping, so the butler showedAndrew into the library. He did not mind waiting until his cousin got up; hefelt at ease surrounded by all those books filling the large, bright room withtheir peculiar musty smell. Andrew’s father prided himself on having built up adecent library, yet his cousin’s collection contained more than just obscurevolumes on politics and other equally dull subjects. Here, Andrew could find theclassics and adventure stories by authors such as Verne and Salgari, but stillmore interesting to Andrew was a strange, rather picturesque type of literaturemany considered frivolous—novels where the authors had let their imaginationsrun wild, regardless of how implausible or often down-right absurd the outcome.Like all discerning readers, Charles appreciated Homer’s Odyssey and his Iliad,but his real enjoyment came from immersing himself in the crazy world ofBatrocomi-omaquia, the blind poet’s satire on his own work in an epic tale abouta battle between mice and frogs. Andrew recalled a few books written in asimilar style which his cousin had lent him; one called True Tales by Luciano deSamosata which recounted a series of fabulous voyages in a flying ship thattakes the hero up to the sun and even through the belly of a giant whale.Another called The Man in the Moon by Francis Godwin, the first novel ever todescribe an interplanetary voyage, that told the story of a Spaniard namedDomingo Gonsales who travels to the moon in a machine drawn by a flock of wildgeese. These flights of fancy reminded Andrew of pop guns or firecrackers, allsound and fury, and yet he understood, or thought he did, why his cousin was sopassionate about them. Somehow this literary genre, which most people condemned,acted as a sort of counterbalance to Charles’s soul; it was the ballast thatprevented him from lurching into seriousness or melancholy, unlike Andrew, whohad been unable to adopt his cousin’s casual attitude to life, and to whomeverything seemed so achingly profound, imbued with that absurd solemnity thatthe transience of existence conferred upon even the smallest act.However, that afternoon Andrew did not have time to look at any book. He did noteven manage to cross the room to the bookshelves because the loveliest girl hehad ever seen stopped him in his tracks. He stood staring at her bemused as timeseemed to congeal, to stand still for a moment, until finally he managed toapproach the portrait slowly to take a closer look. The woman was wearing ablack velvet toque and a flowery scarf knotted at the neck. Andrew had to admitshe was by no means beautiful by conventional standards: her nose wasdisproportionately large for her face, her eyes too close together and herreddish hair looked damaged, and yet at the same time this mysterious womanpossessed a charm as unmistakable as it was elusive. He was unsure exactly whatit was that captivated him about her. Perhaps the contrast between her frailappearance and the strength radiating from her gaze; a gaze he had never seenbefore in any of his conquests, a wild, determined gaze that retained a glimmerof youthful innocence, as if every day the woman was forced to confront theugliness of life. And yet even so, curled up in her bed at night in the dark shestill believed it was only a regrettable figment of her imagination, a bad dreamthat would soon dissolve and give way to a more pleasant reality. It was thegaze of a person who yearns for something and refuses to believe it will neverbe hers, because hope is the only thing she has left.“A charming creature, isn’t she?” Charles’s voice came from behind him.Andrew jumped. He was so absorbed by the portrait he had not heard his cousincome in. He nodded as his cousin walked over to the drinks trolley. He himselfcould not have found any better way to describe the emotions the portraitstirred in him, that desire to protect her mixed with a feeling of admiration hecould only compare—rather reluctantly, owing to the inappropriateness of themetaphor—to that which he felt for cats.“It was my birthday present to my father,” Charles explained pouring a brandy.\"It’s only been hanging there a few days.”“Who is she?” asked Andrew. \"I don’t remember seeing her at any of Lady Hollandor Lord Broughton’s parties.”“At those parties?” Charles laughed. \"I’m beginning to think the artist isgifted. He’s taken you in as well.”“What do you mean?” asked Andrew, accepting the glass of brandy his cousin washolding out to him.“Surely you don’t think I gave it to my father because of its artistic merit?Does it look like a painting worthy of my consideration, cousin?” Charlesgrabbed his arm, forcing him to take a few steps closer to the portrait. \"Take agood look. Notice the brushwork: utterly devoid of talent. The painter is nomore than an amusing disciple of Degas. Where the Parisian is gentle, he isstarkly somber.”Andrew did not understand enough about painting to be able to have a discussionwith his cousin, and all he really wanted to know was the sitter’s identity, andso he nodded gravely, giving his cousin to understand he agreed with his viewthat this painter would do better to devote himself to repairing bicycles.Charles smiled, amused by his cousin’s refusal to take part in a discussionabout painting that would have given him a chance to air his knowledge, andfinally declared:“I had another reason for giving it to him, dear cousin.”He drained his glass slowly, and gazed at the painting again for a few moments,shaking his head with satisfaction.“And what reason was that, Charles?” Andrew asked, becoming impatient.“The private enjoyment I get from knowing that my father, who looks down on thelower classes as though they were inferior beings, has the portrait of a commonprostitute hanging in his library.”His words made Andrew reel.“A prostitute?” he finally managed to stammer.“Yes, cousin,” replied Charles, beaming with content. \"But not a high-classwhore from the brothels in Russell Square, not even one of the tarts who plytheir trade in the park on Vincent Street, but a dirty, foul-smellingdraggletail from Whitechapel in whose ravaged vagina the wretched of the earthalleviate their misery for a few meager pennies.”Andrew took a swig of brandy, attempting to take in his cousin’s words. Therewas no denying his cousin’s revelation had shocked him, as it would anybody whosaw the portrait. But he also felt strangely disappointed. He stared at thepainting again, trying to discover the cause of his unease. So, this lovelycreature was a vulgar tart. Now he understood the mixture of passion andresentment seeping from her eyes that the artist had so skilfully captured. ButAndrew had to admit his disappointment obeyed a far more selfish logic: thewoman did not belong to his social class, which meant he could never meet her.“I bought it thanks to Bruce Driscoll,” Charles explained, pouring two morebrandies. \"Do you remember Bruce?”Andrew nodded unenthusiastically. Bruce was a friend of his cousin whom boredomand money had made an art collector; a conceited, idle young man who had nocompunction in showing off his knowledge of paintings at every opportunity.“You know how he likes to look for treasure in the most unlikely places,” hiscousin said, handing him the second brandy. \"Well, the last time I saw him, hetold me about a painter he’d dug up during one of his visits to the fleamarkets. A man called Walter Sickert, a founding member of the New English ArtClub. His studio was in Cleveland Street, and he painted East End prostitutes asthough they were society ladies. I dropped in there and couldn’t resist buyinghis latest canvas.”“Did he tell you anything about her?” Andrew asked, trying to appear nonchalant.“About the whore? Only her name. I think she’s called Marie Jeannette.”Marie Jeannette, Andrew muttered. The name oddly suited her, like her littlehat.“A Whitechapel whore . . . ,” he whispered, still unable to get over hissurprise.“Yes, a Whitechapel whore. And my father has given her pride of place in hislibrary!” Charles cried, spreading his arms theatrically in a mock gesture oftriumph. \"Isn’t it absolutely priceless?”With this, Charles flung his arm around his cousin’s shoulder and guided himthrough to the sitting room, changing the subject. Andrew tried to hide hisagitation, but could not help thinking about the girl in the portrait as theywere planning their assault on the charming Keller sisters.THAT NIGHT, IN HIS bedroom, Andrew lay wide awake. Where was the woman in thepainting now? What was she doing? By the fourth or fifth question, he had beguncalling the woman by her name, as though he really knew her and they enjoyed anonexistent intimacy. He realized he was seriously disturbed when he began tofeel an absurd jealousy towards the men who could have her for a few pennies,whereas for him, despite all his wealth, she was unattainable. And yet was shereally beyond his reach? Surely, given his position, he could have her,physically at least, more easily than he could any other woman, and for the restof his life. The problem was finding her. Andrew had never been to Whitechapel,but he had heard enough about the neighborhood to know it was dangerous,especially for someone of his class. It was not advisable to go there alone, buthe could not count on Charles accompanying him. His cousin would not understandhim preferring that tart’s grubby vagina to the sweet delights the charmingKeller sisters kept hidden beneath their petticoats, or the perfumed honeypotsof the Chelsea madams, where half the well-to-do West End gentlemen sated theirappetites. Perhaps he would understand, and even agree to go with him for thefun of it, if Andrew explained it as a passing fancy, but he knew what he feltwas too powerful to be reduced to a mere whim. Or was it? He would not know whathe wanted from her until he had her in his arms. Would she really be thatdifficult to find? Three sleepless nights were enough for him to come up with aplan.And so it was that while the Crystal Palace (which had been moved to Sydenhamafter displaying the Empire’s industrial prowess inside its vast belly of glassand reinforced iron) was offering organ recitals, children’s ballets, a host ofventriloquists' acts, and even the possibility of picnicking in its beautifulgardens that Andrew Harrington—oblivious to the festive spirit that had takenhold of the city—put on the humble clothes of a commoner one of his servants hadlent him, and examined his disguise in the cheval glass. He could not helpgiving a wry smile at the sight of himself in a threadbare jacket and trousers,his fair hair tucked under a check cap pulled down over his eyes. Surely lookinglike that people would take him for a nobody, possibly a cobbler or a barber.Disguised in this way, he ordered the astonished Harold to take him toWhitechapel. Before leaving, he made him swear to secrecy. No one must knowabout this expedition to London’s worst neighborhood, not his father, not themistress of the house, not his brother Anthony, not even his cousin Charles. Noone. IIIIN ORDER NOT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIM-self, Andrew made Harold pull up theluxurious carriage in Leadenhall and continued alone on foot towards CommercialStreet. After wandering a good way down that evil-smelling street, he plucked uphis courage and entered the maze of alleyways that made up Whitechapel. Withinten minutes, a dozen prostitutes loomed out of the fog to offer him a trip toMount Venus for the price of a few pennies, but none of them was the girl in theportrait. Had they been draped in seaweed, Andrew might easily have mistakenthem for faded, dirty ship figureheads. He refused them politely withoutpausing, a dreadful sadness welling up in him at the sight of those scarecrowshunched against the cold who had no better way of earning a living. Theirtoothless mouths attempting bawdy smiles were more repulsive than desirable.Would Marie look like that outside the portrait, far from the brushstrokes thathad transformed her into an angelic creature?He soon realized he was unlikely to find her by chance. Perhaps he would havemore luck if he asked for her directly. Once he was sure his disguise wasconvincing, he entered the Ten Bells, a popular tavern on the corner of FournierStreet and Commercial Street opposite the ghostly Christ Church. When he peeredinside the pub, it looked to him like just the sort of place whores went to insearch of clients. As soon as he reached the bar, two of them came up to him.Trying to look casual, Andrew offered them a glass of stout, refusing theirpropositions as politely as possible. He explained he was looking for a womancalled Marie Jeannette. One of the whores left immediately, pretending to beoffended, perhaps because she did not want to waste the evening with someone whodidn’t want to pay for her services, but the other, the taller of the two,decided to accept his invitation:“I suppose you mean Marie Kelly. That dratted Irishwoman, everybody wants her. Iexpect she’s done a few by now and is in the Britannia—that’s where we all gowhen we’ve made enough for a bed and a bit more besides so that we can get drunkquick and forget our sorrows,” she said, with more irony than bitterness.“Where is this tavern?” Andrew asked.“Near here, on the corner of Crispin Street and Dorset Street.”The least Andrew could do was thank her for the information by giving her fourshillings.“Get yourself a room,\"” he recommended, with a warm smile. \"It’s too cold outthere tonight to be traipsing the streets.”“Why, thank you, mister. You’re too kind, I’m sure,” said the whore, genuinelygrateful.Andrew said good-bye, politely doffing his cap.“If Marie Kelly won’t give you what you want, come back and see me,” she shoutedafter him with a flash of coquettishness that was blighted by her toothlesssmile. \"My name’s Liz. Liz Stride, don’t forget.”Andrew had no problem finding the Britannia, a seedy bar with a windowed front.Despite being brilliantly lit by oil lamps, the room was thick with tobaccosmoke. At the far end was a long bar, with a couple of private rooms to theleft. A crowd of noisy customers filled the large main area cluttered withtables and chairs, the floor strewn with sawdust. A fleet of bartenders infilthy aprons squeezed their way between tightly packed tables juggling metaltankards brimming with beer. In the corner, a battered old piano displayed itsgrubby keys to anyone wishing to enliven the evening with a tune. Andrew reachedthe bar, the surface of which was laden with large jugs of wine, oil lamps, andplates of cheese cut into huge chunks that looked more like bits of rubble froma dump. He lit a cigarette from one of the lamps, ordered a pint of beer, andleaned discreetly against the bar, surveying the crowd and wrinkling his nose atthe strong smell of cooked sausage emanating from the kitchen. As he had beentold, the atmosphere there was more relaxed than at the Ten Bells. Most of thetables were occupied by sailors on shore leave and local people dressed asmodestly as he, although he also noticed a few groups of prostitutes busygetting drunk. He sipped his beer slowly and looked for one who fitted MarieKelly’s description, but none did. By his third beer, he had begun to despairand to wonder what on earth he was doing there, chasing an illusion.He was about to leave when she pushed her way through the pub door. Herecognized her at once. There was no doubt about it: she was the girl in theportrait, but more beautiful still for being endowed with movement. Her facelooked drained, yet she moved with the same energy Andrew had imagined she wouldfrom seeing her on canvas. Most of the other customers remained oblivious to theapparition. \"How was it possible for anyone not to react to the small miraclethat had just taken place in the tavern?” thought Andrew. This completeindifference made him feel he was a privileged witness to the phenomenon. And hecould not help recalling the time when, as a child, he had seen the wind take aleaf between invisible fingers and balance the tip of it on the surface of apuddle, spinning it like a top until a carriage wheel put an end to its dance.To Andrew it had seemed that Mother Nature had engineered that magic trick forhis eyes alone. From then on, he was convinced that the universe dazzled mankindwith volcanic eruptions, but had its own secret way of communicating with theselect few, people like Andrew who looked at reality as though it were a stripof wallpaper covering up something else. Taken aback, he watched Marie Kellywalk towards him as if she knew him. This made his heart start pounding, but hecalmed down when she propped her elbow on the bar and ordered half a pint ofbeer without even glancing at him.“Having a good night, Marie?”“Can’t grumble, Mrs. Ringer.”Andrew swallowed, on the verge of blacking out. She was standing next to him! Hecould scarcely believe it, yet it was true. He had heard her voice. A tired,rather husky voice, but lovely in any case. And if he really tried, ridding theair of the superfluous stench of tobacco smoke and sausages, he could probablysmell her, too. Smell Marie Kelly. Mesmerized, Andrew gazed at her inadmiration, rediscovering in her every gesture what he already knew. In the sameway a shell holds the roar of the sea, so this frail-looking body seemed tocontain within it a force of nature.When the landlady placed the beer on the counter, Andrew realized this was anopportunity he must not waste. He rummaged swiftly in his pockets and paidbefore she could:“Allow me, miss.”The gesture, as unexpected as it was chivalrous, earned him an openly approvinglook from Marie Kelly. Being the focus of her gaze paralyzed him. As thepainting had already shown, the girl’s eyes were beautiful, and yet they seemedburied beneath a layer of resentment. He could not help comparing her to a poppyfield where someone has decided to dump refuse. And yet he was completely,hopelessly enthralled by her, and he tried to make that instant when their eyescrossed as meaningful to her as it was to him, but—and my apologies to anyromantic souls reading these lines—some things cannot be expressed in a look.How could Andrew make her share in the almost mystical feeling overwhelming himat that moment? How could he convey, with nothing more than his eyes, the suddenrealization that he had been searching for her all his life without knowing it?If in addition we consider that Marie Kelly’s existence up to that point haddone little to increase her understanding of life’s subtleties, it should comeas no surprise that this initial attempt at spiritual communion (for want of abetter way of putting it) was doomed to failure. Andrew did his best, obviously,but the girl understood his passionate gaze just as she interpreted that of theother men who accosted her every evening.“Thanks, mister,” she replied with a lewd smile, no doubt from force of habit.Andrew nodded, dismissing the significance of a gesture he considered anall-important part of his strategy, then realized with horror that his carefulplan had not taken into account how he was to strike up a conversation with thegirl once he found her. What did he have to say to her? Or more precisely, whatdid he have to say to a whore? A Whitechapel whore, at that. He had neverbothered speaking much to the Chelsea prostitutes, only enough to discusspositions or the lighting in the room, and with the charming Keller sisters, orhis other female acquaintances— young ladies whom it would not do to worry withtalk of politics or Darwin’s theories—he only discussed trivia: Paris fashions,botany, and, more recently spiritualism, the latest craze everyone was takingup. But none of these subjects seemed suitable to discuss with the woman, whowas hardly likely to want to summon up some spirit to tell her which of her manysuitors she would end by marrying. And so he simply stared at her, enraptured.Luckily, Marie Kelly knew a better way of breaking the ice.“I know what you want, mister, although you’re too shy to ask,” she said, hergrin broadening as she gave his hand a fugitive caress that brought him out ingoose pimples. \"Thruppence and I can make your dreams come true. Tonight, at anyrate.”Andrew gazed at her, shaken: she did not know how right she was. She had beenhis only dream those past few nights, his deepest longing, his most urgentdesire, and now, although he was still scarcely able to believe it, finally hecould have her. His whole body tingled with excitement at the mere thought oftouching her, of caressing the slender body silhouetted beneath that shabbydress, of bringing forth deep moans from her lips as he was set alight beforeher eyes, those of a wild animal, a tormented indomitable creature. And yet thattremor of joy rapidly gave way to a profound sadness when he considered theunjust plight of that fallen angel, the ease with which any man could grope her,defile her in a filthy back alley, without anyone in the world uttering a singlecry of protest. Was that what such a unique creature had been created for? Hehad no choice but to accept her invitation, a lump in his throat, distressed atbeing compelled to take her the same way as her other clients, as if hisintentions were no different from theirs. Once he had accepted, Marie Kellysmiled with what looked to Andrew like forced enthusiasm and tilted her head forthem to leave the pub.Andrew felt odd following the whore like that, walking behind her with birdlikesteps as though Marie Kelly were leading him to the gallows instead of to plungebetween her thighs. And yet, could their meeting have been any different? Fromthe moment he came across his cousin’s painting he had been penetrating deeperinto unknown territory, where he could not get his bearings because nothingaround him looked familiar, everything was new, and, judging from the desertedstreets, they were going through, quite possibly dangerous. Was he blithelywalking into some sort of trap laid by the whore’s pimp? He wondered whetherHarold would hear his shouts, and if so, would he bother coming to his aid, oruse the opportunity to avenge himself for the offhand treatment he had receivedfrom his master all these years? After guiding him part of the way along HanburyStreet, a muddy alley dimly lit by a single oil lamp sputtering on a corner,Marie Kelly beckoned him down a narrow passageway leading into pitch-darkness.Andrew followed her, convinced he would meet his death, or at least be beaten towithin an inch of his life by a couple of ruffians much bigger than him, who,having stolen everything including his socks, would spit contemptuously on hisbloody remains. That was how they did things here, and his idiotic adventurerichly deserved such an ending. But before fear had time to take hold, they cameout into a filthy waterlogged backyard, where to his surprise no one was waitingfor him. Andrew glanced warily about him. Yes: strange as it might seem, theywere alone in that evil-smelling place. The world they had left behind wasreduced to a muffled rumble in which a distant church bell’s chimes rang out. Athis feet, the moon reflected in a puddle looked like a crumpled letter someunhappy lover had tossed on the ground.“We won’t be disturbed here, mister,” Marie Kelly reassured him, leaning backagainst the wall and drawing him to her.Before he knew it, she had unbuttoned his trousers and pulled out his penis. Shedid so with startling ease, without any of the provocative foreplay to which theChelsea prostitutes had accustomed him. The matter-of-fact way she maneuveredhis sex beneath her hiked-up skirts made it clear to Andrew that what to him wasanother magical moment for her was no more than simple routine.“It’s in,” she assured him.In? Andrew had enough experience to know the whore was lying. She was simplygripping his penis between her thighs. He assumed it was common practice amongthem, a trick to avoid penetration, which, if they were lucky and the clientfailed to notice or was too drunk, reduced the number of hasty intrusions theywere forced to undergo each day, and with them the unwanted pregnancies such aflood of sperm could bring about. With this in mind, Andrew began thrustingenergetically, prepared to go along with the charade, because in reality it wasmore than enough for him to rub his erect member against the silky skin of herinner thigh, to feel her body pressed against his for as long as the pretenselasted. What did it matter whether it was all a sham if this phantom penetrationallowed him to cross the boundary imposed by good manners and force his way intothat intimacy only lovers share. Feeling her hot sticky breath in his ear,inhaling the delicate odor from her neck, and clasping her to him until he feltthe contours of her body merge with his was worth infinitely more thanthruppence. And, as he soon discovered to his consternation when he ejaculatedinto her petticoats, it had the same effect on him as other greaterundertakings. Slightly ashamed at his lack of endurance, he finished emptyinghimself in quiet contemplation, still pressed against her, until he felt herstir impatiently. He stepped back, embarrassed. Oblivious to his unease, thewhore straightened her skirts and thrust out a hand to be paid. Trying to regainhis composure, Andrew hurriedly gave her the agreed sum. He had enough moneyleft in his pockets to buy her for the whole night, but he preferred to savorwhat he had just experienced in the privacy of his own bed, and to get her tomeet him the next night.“My name’s Andrew,” he introduced himself, his voice high-pitched from emotion.She raised an eyebrow, amused. \"And I’d like to see you again tomorrow.”“Certainly, mister. You know where to find me,” the whore said, leading him backalong the gloomy passageway she had brought him down.As they made their way back towards the main streets, Andrew was wonderingwhether ejaculating between her thighs entitled him to put his arm around hershoulder. He had decided it did, and was about to do precisely that when theyran into another couple walking almost blindly the other way down the dimalleyway. Andrew mumbled an apology to the fellow he had bumped into, who,although scarcely more than a shadow in the darkness, seemed to him quite aburly sort. He was clinging onto a whore, whom Marie Kelly greeted with a smile.“It’s all yours, Annie,” she said, referring to the backyard they had just left.The woman called Annie thanked her with a raucous laugh and tugged her companiontowards the passageway. Andrew watched them stagger into the pitch-blackness.\"Would that burly fellow be satisfied with having his member trapped between herthighs?” he wondered, as he noticed how avidly the man clutched the whore tohim.“Didn’t I tell you it was a quiet spot,” Marie Kelly remarked matter-of-factlyas they came out into Hanbury Street.They said a laconic good-bye in front of the Britannia. Rather disheartened bythe coldness she had shown after the act, Andrew tried to find his way backthrough the gloomy streets to his carriage. It was a good half hour before hefound it. He avoided Harold’s eyes as he climbed back into the coach. \"Home,sir?”Harold enquired sardonically.THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE arrived at the Britannia determined to behave like aself-assured man instead of the fumbling, timid dandy of their previousencounter. He had to overcome his nerves and prove he could adapt to hissurroundings if he was to display his true charms to the girl, that repertoireof smiles and flattery with which he habitually captivated the ladies of his ownclass.He found Marie Kelly sitting at a corner table brooding over a pint of beer. Herdemeanor unnerved him, but knowing he was not the sort to think up a newstrategy as he went along, he decided to stick with his original plan. Heordered a beer at the bar, sat down at the girl’s table as naturally as hecould, and told her he knew of a guaranteed way to wipe the worried expressionfrom her face. Marie Kelly shot him a black look, confirming what he feared: hisremark had been a tactless blunder. Following this reaction, Andrew thought shewas going to tell him to clear off without even wasting her breath, with asimple wave of her hand, like someone shooing away an irritating fly. But in theend, she restrained herself and gazed at him quizzically for a few seconds untilshe must have decided he was as good a person as any to unburden herself to. Shetook a swig from her tankard, as if to clear her throat, wiped her mouth on hersleeve, and told him that her friend Anne, the woman they had bumped into inHanbury Street the night before, had been found that morning, murdered, in thesame yard they had been in. The poor woman had been partially decapitated,sliced open, her intestines pulled out, and her womb removed. Andrew stammeredthat he was sorry, as shocked at the killer’s attention to detail as at havingcollided with him moments before the crime. Evidently that particular client hadnot been satisfied with the usual service. But Marie Kelly had other worries.According to her, Anne was the third prostitute to be murdered in Whitechapel inless than a month. Polly Nichols had been found dead with her throat slit inBucks Road, opposite Essex pier, on August 31. And on the seventh of that samemonth, Martha Tabram had been found brutally stabbed to death with a penknife onthe stairs of a rooming house. Marie Kelly laid the blame on the gang from OldNichol Street, blackmailers who demanded a share of the whores” earnings.“Those bastards will stop at nothing to get us working for them,” she saidbetween gritted teeth.This state of affairs disturbed Andrew, but it should have come as no surprise:after all, they were in Whitechapel—that putrid dung heap London had turned itsback on, home to more than a thousand prostitutes living alongside German,Jewish, and French immigrants. Stabbings were a daily occurrence. Wiping awaythe tears that had finally flowed from her eyes, Marie Kelly sat head bowed insilence for a few moments as though in prayer, until, to Andrew’s surprise, shesuddenly roused herself from her stupor, grasped his hand, and smiled lustfullyat him. Life went on. Whatever else happened, life went on. Was that what shehad meant by her gesture? After all, she, Marie Kelly, had not been murdered.She had to go on living, dragging her skirts through those foul-smelling streetsin search of money to pay for a bed. Andrew gazed with pity at her hand lying inhis, her dirty nails poking through her frayed mitten. He too felt the need toconcentrate for a moment in order to change masks, like an actor who needs sometime in his dressing room to concentrate in order to become a differentcharacter when he goes back on stage. After all, life went on for him, too. Timedid not stop just because a whore had been murdered. And so he stroked her handtenderly, ready to resume his plan. As though wiping condensation from awindowpane, he freed his young lover’s smile from its veil of sadness and,looking her in the eye for the first time, he said:“I have enough money to buy you for the whole night, but I don’t want any fakeryin a cold backyard.”This startled Marie Kelly, and she tensed in her seat, but Andrew’s smile soonput her at ease.“I rent a room at Miller’s Court, but I don’t know if it’ll be good enough forthe likes of you,” she remarked flirtatiously.“I’m sure you’ll make me like it,” Andrew ventured to say, delighted at thebantering tone their conversation had finally taken, as this was a register atwhich he excelled.“But first I’ll have to turn out my good-for-nothing husband,” she replied. \"Hedoesn’t like me bringing work home.”This remark came as yet another shock to Andrew on this extraordinary night overwhich he clearly had no control. He tried not to let his disappointment show.“Still, I’m sure your money will make up his mind for him, Marie concluded,amused at his reaction.SO IT WAS THAT Andrew found paradise in the dismal little room where he was nowsitting. That night, everything changed between them. When at last she laynaked, Andrew made love to her so respectfully, caressed her body with suchtenderness that Marie Kelly could feel the hard shell she had carefully built toprotect her soul begin to crack, that layer of ice preventing anything fromseeping into her skin, keeping everything locked behind the door, out therewhere it could not hurt her. To her surprise, Andrew’s kisses marking her bodylike a pleasurable itch made her own caresses less and less mechanical, and shequickly discovered it was no longer a whore lying on the bed, but the womancrying out for affection that she had always been. Andrew also sensed hislovemaking was freeing the real Marie Kelly, as though he were rescuing her fromthe bottom of one of those water tanks stage magicians immersed their beautifulassistants in, bound hand and foot, or as though his sense of direction were sogood it saved him from getting lost in the maze like her other lovers, allowinghim to reach the place no one else could, a sort of secret corner where thegirl’s real nature survived intact. They burned with a single flame, and when itwaned and Marie Kelly, staring dreamily up at the ceiling, began talking aboutspringtime in Paris, where she had worked as an artist’s model some yearsbefore, and about her childhood in Wales and in Ratcliffe Highway in London,Andrew understood that this strange sensation in his chest must be the pangs oflove, because without meaning to, he was experiencing all the emotions of whichthe poets spoke. Andrew was touched by the emotive tone her voice took on whenshe described the Parisian squares with their riot of gladioli and petunias, andhow on her return to London she had insisted everybody say her name in French,the only way she had found of preserving intact that distant fragrance whichsoftened life’s sharp edges; but he was equally moved by the hint of sadness inher voice as she described how they hung pirates from the Ratcliffe HighwayBridge until they drowned in the rising waters of the Thames. For this was thereal Marie Kelly, this bittersweet fruit, nature’s flawed perfection, one ofGod’s contradictions. When she asked what sort of work he did that couldapparently allow him to buy her for the rest of his life if he wanted, hedecided to run the risk and tell her the truth. Because if their love were toexist it must be nurtured in truth or not at all, and the truth (of how herportrait had captivated him, sending him off on this foolish quest to find herin a neighborhood so different from his own, and of how he had found her) seemedas beautiful and miraculous to him as those stories about impossible love youread in books. When their bodies came together again, he realized that far frombeing an act of madness, falling in love with her was possibly the mostreasonable thing he had ever done. And when he left the room, with the memory ofher skin on his lips, he tried not to look at her husband Joe, who was leaningagainst the wall shivering with cold.It was nearly daylight by the time Harold delivered him home. Too excited to goto bed, if only to relish the moments he had spent with Marie Kelly, Andrew wentto the stables and saddled a horse. It was a long time since he had woken atdawn to go riding in Hyde Park. This was his favorite time of day, when thegrass was still dewy and everything appeared untouched. How could he waste suchan opportunity? Within minutes, Andrew was galloping through the trees oppositethe Harrington mansion, laughing to himself and occasionally letting out a cryof joy, like a soldier celebrating victory, because that is what he felt like ashe remembered the loving look Marie Kelly had given him before they saidgood-bye until the following night. As though she could see in his eyes thatwithout realizing it, he had been searching for her for years. And perhaps Ishould take this opportunity to apologize for my earlier skepticism and confessthat there is nothing that cannot be expressed in a look. A look, it seems, is abottomless well of possibilities. And so Andrew rode on, seized by a wildimpulse, overwhelmed for the first time by a burning, pulsating sensation, whichmight reasonably be described as happiness. And, prey to the effects of such aviolent infatuation, everything in the universe he rode past appeared tosparkle, as though each of its elements—the paths strewn with dead leaves, therocks, the trees, even the squirrels leaping from branch to branch—were lit upby an inner glow. But have no fear, I shall not become bogged down in lengthydescriptions of acres of impassioned, practically luminous parkland because, notonly do I have no taste for it, but it would be untrue, for despite Andrew’saltered vision, the landscape clearly did not undergo any real transformation,not even the squirrels, which are well known as creatures who pursue their owninterests.After more than an hour of strenuous, exhilarating riding, Andrew realized hestill had a whole day to get through before he could return to Marie Kelly’shumble bed, and so he must find some way of distracting himself from thedreadful feeling that would no doubt assail him when he realized thatirrespective of circumstances, or probably because of them, the hands of theclock were not turning at their usual speed, but were actually slowing down onpurpose. He decided to drop in on his cousin Charles, which he usually did whenhe wanted him to share in his joy, even though this time he had no intention oftelling him anything. Perhaps he was simply curious to see what Charles wouldlook like to his feverish gaze which had the power to enhance everything, to seewhether he would also glow like the squirrels in the park."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/bmimg.jpg]"}]
