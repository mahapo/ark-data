G. Wells still in print, still important, still worthreading today?H. G. Wells was an important literary figure during his lifetime. But so, intheir day, were Edmund Spenser and Thomas Gray. Edmund Spenser’s The FaerieQueene was considered, in its time, to be the finest achievement of Englishliterature. Gray’s Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard was one of the mostmemorized, most quoted poems in public life for at least a century, with taglines like “mute inglorious Miltons” and “far from the madding crowd” thatshowed up in so many other people’s writing and speaking that we can onlyconclude that every educated speaker of the English language was expected tohave read it.And yet today it is rare for either work to find readers outside the collegeclassroom. H. G. Wells, on the other hand, published his first short novel, TheTime Machine, more than a century ago, but it is still read, not just bystudents required to study it, but also by volunteers—readers who pick it up,not because they will have to write an essay about it, but because they hope toderive pleasure from the reading.Spenser’s Faerie Queene represented two genres of writing that are both dead asfar as the reading public is concerned. It was an allegory, in which thecharacters and objects and events did not so much represent themselves in thefictional story as they did ideas and events in the outside world; and it was anepic poem, meant to explain the heritage of a nation. Once these genres ceasedto have a public following, Faerie Queene faded along with them.Gray’s Elegy was in the vigorous category of essays in verse, in which a poethas an experience that prompts him to think various deep thoughts, all of whichare presented in rhythm and rhyme so that the sheer sound of the language is apleasure, along with the images and ideas. How could such a vibrant genre everdie?And yet die it did, at least as a part of the public life of educated people. Iknow a good many poets who would argue passionately that I am wrong, but one hasonly to look at what is published in those journals that still persist inpublishing poetry. How many poems are longer than twenty lines? Forty? Sixty? Itis possible to argue that Gray opened the great day of this genre, and T. S.Eliot closed it; but wherever the honor or blame might be bestowed, it cannot becredibly argued that the genre is not, effectively, dead.Nobody comes out of a movie or puts down a novel and says, “Oh, if only theycould adapt this story into an epic poem!” Nor does anyone emerge from thetheater or the book and immediately record his experience and thoughts in ahundred-line essay in verse. Or if someone does, it is without the faintest hopethat it will find an audience larger than the number of the poet’s most patientfriends.H. G. Wells’s work remains alive because the genre that he created—sciencefiction—remains alive, and its readers and writers remember Wells as one of thefathers of their field. More importantly, his novels remain within themainstream of contemporary science fiction. It is not such a far leap to go fromthe work of Bruce Sterling or Connie Willis, Isaac Asimov or Robert Heinlein tothe work of H. G. Wells.A genre of literature remains alive as long as there is an audience thatpersists in seeking it out and reading it for the pleasure of it. It can alsohave a kind of secondary life, a bit like a suit of armor in a museum, as longas teachers make it the awful duty of students to “know” works in that genrethat they would never have chosen for themselves. But the preservation andadmiration of an artifact does not mean that it is not dead. Few choose to churnbutter when they can buy it by the pound in the grocery store, or spend theirdays spinning thread so they can weave the cloth to make their own clothing.I believe that storytelling is as vital to human life as butter churning orspindle and distaff or suits of armor ever were. There is no human society thatdoes not devote some part of their lives to hearing tales and songs that givevoice to their own experience and provide them with memories of experiences theyhave never had.But the means of storytelling changes, and so does the audience.For many centuries—from Roman times through the Middle Ages—the preferredstorytelling genre was the romance. (Not the love story that we associate withthat word today, but any kind of tale of the lives of heroes that includes theirlove affairs along with their heroic deeds.)Romances could deal with terrible crimes and the vengeance that ensued, or withadultery leading to war, or any number of extravagant events. There was oftenmagic and sometimes religion (less often than you might expect), but one thingwas certain: Romance rarely bore much relation to the ordinary life of themembers of the audience.The fashion of jousting long outlasted its utility as training forbattle—because romances made it seem wonderful and, of course, romantic to dressup in armor and try to knock someone off his horse. But as the printing pressspread literacy to an ever-increasing number of people and to social classesthat previously got their stories from mummers and players, some writers beganto seek to write about lives of real people. And so the novel was born—theromance nouvelle, the “new romance” that did away with the deeds of great heroesand instead told of the sorts of people readers might expect to actually meet inreal life.Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, considered by many to be the first commerciallysuccessful novel, might seem to be pretty extravagant, but think again. Thenovel concerns itself with something that was not that uncommon in Defoe’sday—shipwreck. And when the book came out, much of the original audience wasquite familiar with the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who was put ashore (athis own request) on a rarely visited island, where he survived for five yearsbefore being rescued.The novel concerns itself not with heroic deeds, but with the practical problemsof staying alive without technology. What the audience saw was not magic orbattles or vengeance or thwarted love—they saw a man who had to swim out to awrecked ship to retrieve supplies he’d need in order to survive. The readers inDefoe’s day knew that everything that happened in Crusoe might really happen.And in short order other writers, liberated or motivated by the commercialsuccess of Defoe’s novel, began their own stories of perfectly believable peopledealing with difficult problems. When one reads Pride and Prejudice it might notcome to mind that Austen owed any debt to Robinson Crusoe, but she did. Becauseif there had been no audience for novels about real people leading seeminglyordinary lives, Austen would not have undertaken to write her books.Which brings us, again, to the relationship between H. G. Wells and today’sliterary genre of science fiction.Wells did not invent science fiction. Jules Verne had already written hisextraordinary series of novels (or, arguably, romances) in which lone scientistsor adventurers achieve the technology to do previously impossible things. LikeWells’s, Verne’s works continue to be read by volunteers in the English-speakingworld—and in translation, no less.Yet, oddly enough, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Journey to theCentre of the Earth and Around the World in Eighty Days, while they continue tofind new readers, did not give birth to a genre. Verne’s works remained suigeneris—instead of anyone saying, Do you read science fiction? they would say,Have you read Jules Verne?Perhaps this is because Verne’s stories were centered on spectacle. You wentalong on the adventure just to see the sights. To people without television ormovies, what Verne brought was a trip to the bottom of the sea, to the top ofthe sky, to the moon, a journey around the world. He was not exploring ideas somuch as he was leading a tour.H. G. Wells certainly gave his readers plenty to look at. The First Men in theMoon has obvious echoes of Verne’s earlier journey there, and The Time Machineis as much a guided tour as Around the World in Eighty Days or Journey to theCentre of the Earth.But Wells did something more. The Time Machine’s time machine was like CaptainNemo’s underwater ship—a device to get us to the places Wells wanted us to see,along with some adventures involving the machine itself. Where, though, didWells take us? Into a future that clearly developed from (and exaggerated) theills he perceived in the society of his day. The class distinction betweenmanual laborers operating great machines, and clerical and managerial workerswhose clothing was never dirtied during the day’s work, was extrapolated into afuture in which the one-time underclass has evolved into the dominant,underground-dwelling Morlocks, who keep the “white-collar” people who frolic inthe sunshine as cattle, to be slaughtered and fed upon from time to time.This was not just a guided tour. Like Jonathan Swift with Gulliver’s Travels,Wells took his readers to strange places in order to give them a clearer look atthemselves.Likewise, The War of the Worlds was an exciting adventure story about the effortto repel an invasion from a technologically superior race from Mars. But it alsohas a very clear message about the devastation caused when one group colonizesanother. Written to an audience that lived in either the last throes or theheyday of the British Empire, this was a sobering idea to say, See what it’slike when an alien enemy descends upon you, and you have no power to resistthem?Still, the comparison to Gulliver’s Travels is an apt one. Swift, in writingthat wonderful satire, did not really spawn a genre— journeys to undiscoveredlands had figured in satirical literature for generations. Whenever a writerwanted to call for the correction of ills in his own society, he could alwayswrite either a utopian novel, showing a land where they had solved all theproblems and now lived idyllically, or a dystopian, cautionary one, showing aland where the problems of the writer’s own society had been taken to terribleextremes. (Indeed, Gulliver’s Travels does both.)Gulliver’s Travels remained and remains a classic—but it did not create a genreof literature. People weren’t writing hundreds of “gullivers” a century after hewrote the first one.Why, then, did Wells’s work leave a legacy achieved by neither Swift’s norVerne’s?By combining what Verne did—playing with new technologies in order to explorestrange places in the real world—with what Swift did—taking readers to strangesituations in order to point out problems in the real world—Wells’s fictionachieved a seriousness and urgency that Verne’s never had, and a plausibility(it could really happen!) that Swift never even attempted.Most important, Wells wrote of a world that was being transformed, not bytechnology per se, but by the things human beings were choosing to do with thattechnology. He was no Luddite—he didn’t hate the machines. Instead he hated theway society was ordered, so that those who worked the machines were oppressed bythose who merely owned them.In fact, one can feel in Wells’s work an excitement for, a love of, the newmachines. He—and his characters—embraced the new technologies, seeing in themthe possibility of glorious improvements in human society, along with greatdangers.And because his readers had already seen and continued to see their world—theirsocial patterns—radically changed by the introduction of new technology, theyrecognized that here at last was a writer who, instead of moaning about the lostpast, was prepared to make wise guesses about where the next wave of inventionmight take human society, and how it might make the world better or worse.In the lifetime of Wells’s earliest readers and their parents, England hadchanged from a land where every journey was a major undertaking to one where itwas simply a matter of consulting the railway schedule; from a place where newsof great and terrible events was transmitted by letter to a place where, if theneed was great, everyone in England was a phone call or telegram away.Flickering, expensive candlelight had been replaced by gaslight and then thesteady, cheap glow of the electric bulb.These were not trivial changes, and by now everyone expected that there was moreto come. They read about the attempts of various inventors to achieveheavier-than-air flight and self-propelled vehicles that didn’t have to run ontracks; they followed the news of the laying of transoceanic cables; their storyof the origin of life was stretching from thousands to millions of years, frommiracle to the plodding progress of evolution. Their sky was now populated notby tiny stars but by billions of suns, potentially surrounded by worlds liketheir own.Wells found many readers eager to embrace his vision—or, at least, to take itseriously enough to argue with him about it.So it was that as Wells achieved the peak of his popularity between the worldwars, a Luxembourg-born American publisher named Hugo Gernsback decided tolaunch a cheap fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, that offered stories “like H.G. Wells’s scientific romances.” He proposed to call this kind of storyscientifiction—but the name never really caught on, in part, I think, becausenobody knew whether to put the accent on tif, as in the word scientific, or onfic, as in fiction.Instead, these stories were soon called (by everyone but Gernsback), sciencefiction.To be honest, few of these stories were very much like Wells’s work, at least inquality. Often they were Verne-like adventure stories and guided tours. Butenough of them offered the same kind of challenging visions and plausiblescience to keep open the possibilities Wells had first demonstrated.Within a few years, another visionary editor, John W. Campbell, overseeingAmazing’s rival, Astounding Stories (now called Analog), transformed the genreagain by insisting that his magazine’s writers make sure the science in theirstories could really work—tying them, in other words, more closely to the realworld, and forcing them to examine with greater rigor the difference betweenfantasy and what might really happen.At the same time as Campbell’s revolution, one lone writer, Robert A. Heinlein,became the dominant writer of science fiction, not just because he came up withwonderful ideas, but because he created characters who bore some resemblance toreal people. This was different from either Wells or Verne, whosecharacterizations were minimal—for Heinlein, it was the experience of theindividual, plausibly presented, that mattered most, and as a result sciencefiction became personal. It is hard to overstate his dominance of and influenceon science fiction. It is fair to say that after Campbell’s and Heinlein’srevolutions, it became almost impossible to have a career as a science fictionwriter if your science was sloppy and your characters unbelievable. As with thetransition from silent films to talkies, there were those whose careers fadedaway because they could not make the transformation.Oddly enough, in England itself science fiction never became quite the same kindof ghettoized genre that it did in America. Because Wells was an Englishman, andremained an important literary figure in that country even after his cache hadrather faded across the Atlantic, there were British writers who followed in histradition quite directly, without passing through (but not ignoring, either) therevolutions in American science fiction. J. G. Ballard, for instance, and BrianAldiss, among many others, have written works that are definitely sciencefiction, but don’t sort themselves neatly into the channels and grooves thatmark American sci-fi.The revolutions in American science fiction have continued, though often whatcalls itself a revolution is merely a fad: Let’s all play with this style ofwriting or this version of the future, and sneer at those who don’t do it ourway. The proof of this is simple: While nobody writes the pre-Campbellian,pre-Heinleinian kind of science fiction now (except for movies and comic books),all the different “revolutions” since then coexist quite easily, as readers skipfrom one to another. Readers can happily go from Heinlein to Le Guin to Niven toEllison to Varley to Gibson to Willis to Robinson and find that they are still,basically, in the same literary neighborhood.While those who try to make the jump from Asimov back to a point only a fewyears earlier—E. E. “Doc” Smith, for instance— find that it is a vast gulf. Manyreaders of the still-modern Asimov find themselves reading Smith and saying,What is this?But nobody says that about H. G. Wells.Indeed, one might suggest that it took John W. Campbell’s revolution to bringthe genre spawned in imitation of Wells up to the point where its writers were,in fact, writing the same kind of fiction as Wells. Had Campbell and Heinleinnot transformed science fiction, it might have become a mere footnote in thehistory of the pulp magazines—after they were killed by the advent oftelevision.And if the commercial genre of science fiction had faded away with the pulps, itis likely, I think (though impossible to say for sure), that Wells, too, mighthave faded into a footnote; or remained, at best, like Verne, prized for hisparticular stories, but not the founder of anything, and not terribly importantin the history of literature.It’s rather like the old idea of the extended family—that you raise yourchildren, and help them raise their children, so that when you’re old and toofeeble to work, they’ll continue to take care of you.Wells’s work was so powerful in its blend of believability, satire, and vision,and came at such an apt time in history, that other writers sought to emulatehim, and publishers to make money from selling the imitations.And those imitators—literary children, if you will—grew up, eventually, to beworthy successors, to the point that they are constantly finding new readers,not only for their own stories, but for the stories of their literary father, H.G. Wells.Today there are hundreds of different doors into science fiction. But at thebeginning, there was only one door, and H. G. Wells was the one who turned thekey, opened it, and stepped through, showing everyone else the way. Inapproaching When the Sleeper Wakes, modern readers will immediately notice someelements of strangeness in the way it’s written. Which is not at all surprising.Literature is written within the context of a literary community. Wells wroteusing the literary tools available to a writer of his time, and the text of hisstory was designed with the expectations of his readers in mind.In Wells’s day, it was commonplace for the fiction writer to speak directly tothe reader, as in this essay I can freely address you. Since then, however, thefashion has changed, and most books written in the past fifty years use what wecall the “third person limited point of view,” in which the narrator shows thereader only what is seen, known, and felt by one character at a time.The result is that in contemporary fiction, we expect to know intimately onlyone character at a time, and experience each portion of the story as if we dweltinside the viewpoint character’s mind. This encourages us to identify with thatcharacter— to draw the events of the story into our minds as if we hadexperienced them along with the viewpoint character.That intimacy was not quite available to Wells. So from the start, we experienceGraham—the Sleeper—from the outside. He is a stranger who approaches a stranger,and when he falls asleep, we know almost nothing about his life or the lives ofthose who talk about him. All that we have to interest us is his situation:Sleep deprived, and then asleep for an extraordinarily long time.Even when he awakes, we do not experience his sense of loss—we don’t know, whenhe first realizes how long he has slept, whom he misses. Was there someone inparticular that he loved? Was there some work that was interrupted? A novelistof our day would probably have made sure we already knew him so well that whenhe awoke from his sleep, we would experience his sense of loss along with him.But that was not Wells’s purpose. It was not the character, but the idea thatdrew him and that must draw us. That is, we are expected to understand that thepassage of centuries in sleep would shock and grieve the character, but we arenot expected to share his grief.Instead, Wells wants us to see how the world is transformed. Strange machinerywhose purpose Graham cannot guess; familiar devices that have been redesigned ormechanized; and things that have not changed at all, but which are now called bydifferent names.It is, in fact, the strangeness that is intended to draw the reader through thestory—we will want to see the future.The odd result of this is to root the story quite firmly in its own time. Afterall, when Wells makes guesses about the wonders that the future will bring, hedepends on the reader’s complete ignorance of that future.But we, reading When the Sleeper Wakes, have clear knowledge of what actuallyhappened during half of the two centuries that Graham slept. And of course a lotof Wells’s speculation is quite wrong—but much of it is also weirdly right.We have not switched to a base-twelve numbering system. The idea seemsabsurd—why would we switch away from the convenience of counting by tens? But infact, vast portions of our society have been turned over to two other numberingsystems: the two languages of computer programming, the binary (base two) andthe hexadecimal (base sixteen). Surely to Wells’s readers such a mathematicalshift would have been even more absurd than the duodecimal system he proposes!His door that rolls up when people approach it seems odd; but doors that openupon our approach, signal lights that change when we drive over a sensor in theroad, and thousands of other machines that automatically anticipate our desiresare a routine part of our lives. Wells was wrong in detail, but right inprinciple.Still, the unavoidable effect is for us to experience his future, not as athrilling or alarming possibility, but as a quaintly old-fashioned vision. Whenthe Sleeper Wakes is thus removed from us by the old-fashioned narrativeviewpoint and by the inevitable errors in his predictions. The result, for thecontemporary reader, is a loss of urgency in the reading. What was once a visionis now a relic—at least, it can seem that way at first.Wells is hardly alone in this. Take the opening of Edward Bellamy’s LookingBackward, first published in 1888—another book that predicted the future, andwhich was so familiar in Wells’s day that in chapter 2 and chapter 7 of When theSleeper Wakes, Wells refers to “Bellamy” as if every reader in his day wouldknow who Bellamy was and what he wrote.Here are the opening lines of Looking Backward: “I first saw the light in thecity of Boston in the year 1857. ‘What!’ you say, ‘eighteen fifty-seven? That isan odd slip. He means nineteen fiftyseven, of course.’ I beg pardon, but thereis no mistake.”To a reader in 1888, this opening would have been fascinating because theimplication is that the reader of 1888 is actually living in 1988. But to us,reading this opening in the twenty-first century with both 1888 and 1988 wellbehind us, what strikes us most glaringly is how old-fashioned it seems, infiction, to address the reader so directly.Let me give you three more sentences of Bellamy, from the second paragraph:“These statements seem so absurd on their face, especially when I add that I ama young man apparently of about thirty years of age, that no person can beblamed for refusing to read another word of what promises to be a mereimposition upon his credulity. Nevertheless I earnestly assure the reader thatno imposition is intended, and will undertake, if he shall follow me a fewpages, to entirely convince him of this. If I may, then, provisionally assume,with the pledge of justifying the assumption, that I know better than the readerwhen I was born, I will go on with my narrative.”The author’s wit is undeniable, but most contemporary readers are not accustomedto fiction with sentences festooned with so many clauses and commas, with a toneso elevated, and with so little forward movement of the story in so many wordsof text. In short, many a modern reader will think, upon reading thesesentences, “This is going to be a pretty thick read.”It’s easy to see how much more accessible and readable Wells is. Compared tomore recent science fiction, Wells’s tone can seem cool and distant at times,sentimental or melodramatic at others; but compared to Bellamy, Wells’s writingis quick, clear, and intimate, the world he creates plausible, the movement ofthe story rapid indeed. This is much of the reason why it is Wells, not Bellamy,who is regarded as the father of science fiction.Wells goes farther. He isn’t just giving us a tour of the future, he’s showingus how the very fact that this Sleeper has lived for all these years transformssociety. Graham isn’t just an observer. He is the catalyst. The future intowhich he awakens has been changed by the fact that he slept, and is changedagain by the fact that he awakens.This is what transforms a predictive essay or a socialist polemic into a storythat lives in memory. Had Wells merely preached some utopian vision, he wouldhardly be remembered today. Guessing correctly about the potential of aircombat, as Wells does in When the Sleeper Wakes, would earn him a footnote inthe history of aviation. Writing a compelling story that includes successfulpredictions has earned him a place in the history of literature, and more: Hiswork continues to be contemporary literature, which is still read for its ownsake.ORSON SCOTT CARD has written many science fiction novels, including Ender’s Gameand Pastwatch.

Halfway down the precipitous path to the Pentargen beach hecame suddenly upon a man sitting in an attitude of profound distress beneath aprojecting mass of rock. The hands of this man hung limply over his knees, hiseyes were red and staring before him, and his face was wet with tears.He glanced round at Isbister’s footfall. Both men were disconcerted, Isbisterthe more so, and, to override the awkwardness of his involuntary pause, heremarked, with an air of mature conviction, that the weather was hot for thetime of year.“Very,” answered the stranger shortly, hesitated a second, and added in acolourless tone, “I can’t sleep.”Isbister stopped abruptly. “No?” was all he said, but his bearing conveyed hishelpful impulse.“It may sound incredible,” said the stranger, turning weary eyes to Isbister’sface and emphasizing his words with a languid hand, “but I have had no sleep—nosleep at all for six nights.”“Had advice?”“Yes. Bad advice for the most part. Drugs. My nervous system. . . . They are allvery well for the run of people. It’s hard to explain. I dare not take . . .sufficiently powerful drugs.”“That makes it difficult,” said Isbister.He stood helplessly in the narrow path, perplexed what to do. Clearly the manwanted to talk. An idea natural enough under the circumstances, prompted him tokeep the conversation going. “I’ve never suffered from sleeplessness myself,” hesaid in a tone of commonplace gossip, “but in those cases I have known, peoplehave usually found something—”“I dare make no experiments.”He spoke wearily. He gave a gesture of rejection, and for a space both men weresilent.“Exercise?” suggested Isbister diffidently, with a glance from hisinterlocutor’s face of wretchedness to the touring costume he wore.“That is what I have tried. Unwisely perhaps. I have followed the coast, dayafter day—from New Quay. It has only added muscular fatigue to the mental. Thecause of this unrest was overwork—trouble. There was something—”He stopped as if from sheer fatigue. He rubbed his forehead with a lean hand. Heresumed speech like one who talks to himself.“I am a lone wolf, a solitary man, wandering through a world in which I have nopart. I am wifeless—childless—who is it speaks of the childless as the deadtwigs on the tree of life? I am wifeless, childless—I could find no duty to do.No desire even in my heart. One thing at last I set myself to do.“I said, I will do this, and to do it, to overcome the inertia of this dullbody, I resorted to drugs. Great God, I’ve had enough of drugs! I don’t know ifyou feel the heavy inconvenience of the body, its exasperating demand of timefrom the mind—time— life! Live! We only live in patches. We have to eat, andthen comes the dull digestive complacencies—or irritations. We have to take theair or else our thoughts grow sluggish, stupid, run into gulfs and blind alleys.A thousand distractions arise from within and without, and then comes drowsinessand sleep. Men seem to live for sleep. How little of a man’s day is his own—evenat the best! And then come those false friends, those Thug helpers, thealkaloids that stifle natural fatigue and kill rest— black coffee, cocaine—”“I see,” said Isbister.“I did my work,” said the sleepless man with a querulous intonation.“And this is the price?”“Yes.”For a little while the two remained without speaking.“You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel—a hunger and thirst. Forsix long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, swift,unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere, spinninground swift and steady—”He paused. “Towards the gulf.”“You must sleep,” said Isbister decisively, and with an air of a remedydiscovered. “Certainly you must sleep.”“My mind is perfectly lucid. It was never clearer. But I know I am drawingtowards the vortex. Presently—”“Yes?”“You have seen things go down an eddy? Out of the light of the day, out of thissweet world of sanity—down—”“But,” expostulated Isbister.The man threw out a hand towards him, and his eyes were wild, and his voicesuddenly high. “I shall kill myself. If in no other way—at the foot of yonderdark precipice there, where the waves are green, and the white surge lifts andfalls, and that little thread of water trembles down. There at any rate is . . .sleep.”“That’s unreasonable,” said Isbister, startled at the man’s hysterical gust ofemotion. “Drugs are better than that.”“There at any rate is sleep,” repeated the stranger, not heeding him.Isbister looked at him and wondered transitorily if some complex Providence hadindeed brought them together that afternoon. “It’s not a cert, you know,” heremarked. “There’s a cliff like that at Lulworth Cove—as high, anyhow—and alittle girl fell from top to bottom. And lives to-day—sound and well.”“But those rocks there?”“One might lie on them rather dismally through a cold night, broken bonesgrating as one shivered, chill water splashing over you. Eh?”Their eyes met. “Sorry to upset your ideals,” said Isbister with a sense ofdevil-may-careish brilliance. “But a suicide over that cliff (or any cliff forthe matter of that), really, as an artist—” He laughed. “It’s so damnedamateurish.”“But the other thing,” said the sleepless man irritably, “the other thing. Noman can keep sane if night after night—”“Have you been walking along this coast alone?”“Yes.”“Silly sort of thing to do. If you’ll excuse my saying so. Alone! As you say;body fag is no cure for brain fag. Who told you to? No wonder; walking! And thesun on your head, heat, fag, solitude, all the day long, and then, I suppose,you go to bed and try very hard—eh?”Isbister stopped short and looked at the sufferer doubtfully.“Look at these rocks!” cried the seated man with a sudden force of gesture.“Look at that sea that has shone and quivered there for ever! See the whitespume rush into darkness under that great cliff. And this blue vault, with theblinding sun pouring from the dome of it. It is your world. You accept it, yourejoice in it. It warms and supports and delights you. And for me—”He turned his head and showed a ghastly face, bloodshot pallid eyes andbloodless lips. He spoke almost in a whisper. “It is the garment of my misery.The whole world . . . is the garment of my misery.”Isbister looked at all the wild beauty of the sunlit cliffs about them and backto that face of despair. For a moment he was silent.He started, and made a gesture of impatient rejection. “You get a night’ssleep,” he said, “and you won’t see much misery out here. Take my word for it.”He was quite sure now that this was a providential encounter. Only half an hourago he had been feeling horribly bored. Here was employment the bare thought ofwhich was righteous self-applause. He took possession forthwith. It seemed tohim that the first need of this exhausted being was companionship. He flunghimself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the motionless seated figure,and deployed forthwith into a skirmishing line of gossip.His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he stared dismally seaward, andspoke only in answer to Isbister’s direct questions—and not to all of those. Buthe made no sign of objection to this benevolent intrusion upon his despair.In a helpless way he seemed even grateful, and when presently Isbister, feelingthat his unsupported talk was losing vigour, suggested that they should reascendthe steep and return towards Boscastle, alleging the view into Blackapit, hesubmitted quietly. Halfway up he began talking to himself, and abruptly turned aghastly face on his helper. “What can be happening?” he asked with a gauntillustrative hand. “What can be happening? Spin, spin, spin, spin. It goes roundand round, round and round for evermore.”He stood with his hand circling.“It’s all right, old chap,” said Isbister with the air of an old friend. “Don’tworry yourself. Trust to me.”The man dropped his hand and turned again. They went over the brow in singlefile and to the headland beyond Penally, with the sleepless man gesticulatingever and again, and speaking fragmentary things concerning his whirling brain.At the headland they stood for a space by the seat that looks into the darkmysteries of Blackapit, and then he sat down. Isbister had resumed his talkwhenever the path had widened sufficiently for them to walk abreast. He wasenlarging upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle Harbour in badweather, when suddenly and quite irrelevantly his companion interrupted himagain.“My head is not like what it was,” he said, gesticulating for want of expressivephrases. “It’s not like what it was. There is a sort of oppression, a weight.No—not drowsiness, would God it were! It is like a shadow, a deep shadow fallingsuddenly and swiftly across something busy. Spin, spin into the darkness. Thetumult of thought, the confusion, the eddy and eddy. I can’t express it. I canhardly keep my mind on it—steadily enough to tell you.”He stopped feebly.“Don’t trouble, old chap,” said Isbister. “I think I can understand. At anyrate, it don’t matter very much just at present about telling me, you know.”The sleepless man thrust his knuckles into his eyes and rubbed them. Isbistertalked for awhile while this rubbing continued, and then he had a fresh idea.“Come down to my room,” he said, “and try a pipe. I can show you some sketchesof this Blackapit. If you’d care?”The other rose obediently and followed him down the steep.Several times Isbister heard him stumble as they came down, and his movementswere slow and hesitating. “Come in with me,” said Isbister, “and try somecigarettes and the blessed gift of alcohol. If you take alcohol?”The stranger hesitated at the garden gate. He seemed no longer clearly aware ofhis actions. “I don’t drink,” he said slowly, coming up the garden path, andafter a moment’s interval repeated absently, “No—I don’t drink. It goes round.Spin, it goes—spin—”He stumbled at the doorstep and entered the room with the bearing of one whosees nothing.Then he sat down abruptly and heavily in the easy chair, seemed almost to fallinto it. He leant forward with his brows on his hands and became motionless.Presently he made a faint sound in his throat. Isbister moved about the roomwith the nervousness of an inexperienced host, making little remarks thatscarcely required answering. He crossed the room to his portfolio, placed it onthe table and noticed the mantel clock.“I don’t know if you’d care to have supper with me,” he said with an unlightedcigarette in his hand—his mind troubled with a design of the furtiveadministration of chloral. “Only cold mutton, you know, but passing sweet.Welsh. And a tart, I believe.” He repeated this after momentary silence.The seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped, match in hand, regarding him.The stillness lengthened. The match went out, the cigarette was put down unlit.The man was certainly very still. Isbister took up the portfolio, opened it, putit down, hesitated, seemed about to speak. “Perhaps,” he whispered doubtfully.Presently he glanced at the door and back to the figure. Then he stole ontip-toe out of the room, glancing at his companion after each elaborate pace.He closed the door noiselessly. The house door was standing open, and he wentout beyond the porch, and stood where the monkshood rose at the corner of thegarden bed. From this point he could see the stranger through the open window,still and dim, sitting head on hand. He had not moved.A number of children going along the road stopped and regarded the artistcuriously. A boatman exchanged civilities with him. He felt that possibly hiscircumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and unaccountable. Smoking,perhaps, might seem more natural. He drew pipe and pouch from his pocket, filledthe pipe slowly.“I wonder, . . .” he said, with a scarcely perceptible loss of complacency. “Atany rate one must give him a chance.” He struck a match in the virile way, andproceeded to light his pipe.Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming with his lamp lit from thekitchen. He turned, gesticulating with his pipe, and stopped her at the door ofhis sitting-room. He had some difficulty in explaining the situation inwhispers, for she did not know he had a visitor. She retreated again with thelamp, still a little mystified to judge from her manner, and he resumed hishovering at the corner of the porch, flushed and less at his ease.Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when the bats were abroad, hiscuriosity dominated his complex hesitations, and he stole back into his darklingsitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger was still in the sameattitude, dark against the window. Save for the singing of some sailors aboardone of the little slate-carrying ships in the harbour, the evening was verystill. Outside, the spikes of monkshood and delphinium stood erect andmotionless against the shadow of the hillside. Something flashed into Isbister’smind; he started, and leaning over the table, listened. An unpleasant suspiciongrew stronger; became conviction. Astonishment seized him and became— dread!No sound of breathing came from the seated figure!He crept slowly and noiselessly round the table, pausing twice to listen. Atlast he could lay his hand on the back of the armchair. He bent down until thetwo heads were ear to ear.Then he bent still lower to look up at his visitor’s face. He started violentlyand uttered an exclamation. The eyes were void spaces of white.He looked again and saw that they were open and with the pupils rolled under thelids. He was suddenly afraid. Overcome by the strangeness of the man’scondition, he took him by the shoulder and shook him. “Are you asleep?” he said,with his voice jumping into alto, and again, “Are you asleep?”A conviction took possession of his mind that this man was dead. He suddenlybecame active and noisy, strode across the room, blundering against the table ashe did so, and rang the bell.“Please bring a light at once,” he said in the passage. “There is somethingwrong with my friend.”Then he returned to the motionless seated figure, grasped the shoulder, shookit, and shouted. The room was flooded with yellow glare as his astonishedlandlady entered with the light. His face was white as he turned blinkingtowards her. “I must fetch a doctor at once,” he said. “It is either death or afit. Is there a doctor in the village? Where is a doctor to be found?”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2THE TRANCEThe state of cataleptic rigour into which this man had fallen, lasted for anunprecedented length of time, and then he passed slowly to the flaccid state, toa lax attitude suggestive of profound repose. Then it was his eyes could beclosed.He was removed from the hotel to the Boscastle surgery, and from the surgery,after some weeks, to London. But he still resisted every attempt at reanimation.After a time, for reasons that will appear later, these attempts werediscontinued. For a great space he lay in that strange condition, inert andstill—neither dead nor living but, as it were, suspended, hanging midway betweennothingness and existence. His was a darkness unbroken by a ray of thought orsensation, a dreamless inanition, a vast space of peace. The tumult of his mindhad swelled and risen to an abrupt climax of silence. Where was the man? Whereis any man when insensibility takes hold of him?“It seems only yesterday,” said Isbister. “I remember it all as though ithappened yesterday—clearer perhaps, than if it had happened yesterday.”It was the Isbister of the last chapter, but he was no longer a young man. Thehair that had been brown and a trifle in excess of the fashionable length, wasiron grey and clipped close, and the face that had been pink and white was buffand ruddy. He had a pointed beard shot with grey. He talked to an elderly manwho wore a summer suit of drill (the summer of that year was unusually hot).This was Warming, a London solicitor and next of kin to Graham, the man who hadfallen into the trance. And the two men stood side by side in a room in a housein London regarding his recumbent figure.It was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed and clad in a flowing shirt, afigure with a shrunken face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and lank nails, andabout it was a case of thin glass. This glass seemed to mark off the sleeperfrom the reality of life about him, he was a thing apart, a strange, isolatedabnormality. The two men stood close to the glass, peering in.“The thing gave me a shock,” said Isbister. “I feel a queer sort of surpriseeven now when I think of his white eyes. They were white, you know, rolled up.Coming here again brings it all back to me.”“Have you never seen him since that time?” asked Warming.“Often wanted to come,” said Isbister; “but business nowadays is too serious athing for much holiday keeping. I’ve been in America most of the time.”“If I remember rightly,” said Warming, “you were an artist?”“Was. And then I became a married man. I saw it was all up with black and white,very soon—at least for a mediocre man, and I jumped on to process. Those posterson the Cliffs at Dover are by my people.”“Good posters,” admitted the solicitor, “though I was sorry to see them there.”“Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary,” exclaimed Isbister withsatisfaction. “The world changes. When he fell asleep, twenty years ago, I wasdown at Boscastle with a box of water-colours and a noble, old-fashionedambition. I didn’t expect that some day my pigments would glorify the wholeblessed coast of England, from Land’s End round again to the Lizard. Luck comesto a man very often when he’s not looking.”Warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. “I just missed seeing you, if Irecollect aright.”“You came back by the trap that took me to Camelford railway station. It wasclose on the Jubilee, Victoria’s Jubilee, because I remember the seats and flagsin Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea.”“The Diamond Jubilee, it was,” said Warming; “the second one.”“Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee—the Fifty Year affair—I was down at Wookey—aboy. I missed all that. . . . What a fuss we had with him! My landlady wouldn’ttake him in, wouldn’t let him stay—he looked so queer when he was rigid. We hadto carry him in a chair up to the hotel. And the Boscastle doctor—it wasn’t thepresent chap, but the G. P. before him—was at him until nearly two, with me andthe landlord holding lights and so forth.”“It was a cataleptic rigour at first, wasn’t it?”“Stiff !—wherever you bent him he stuck. You might have stood him on his headand he’d have stopped. I never saw such stiffness. Of course this”—he indicatedthe prostrate figure by a movement of his head—“is quite different. And, ofcourse, the little doctor—what was his name?”“Smithers?”“Smithers it was—was quite wrong in trying to fetch him round too soon,according to all accounts. The things he did. Even now it makes me feel all—ugh!Mustard, snuff, pricking. And one of those beastly little things, not dynamos—”“Induction coils.”“Yes. You could see his muscles throb and jump, and he twisted about. There wasjust two flaring yellow candles, and all the shadows were shivering, and thelittle doctor nervous and putting on side, and him—stark and squirming in themost unnatural ways. Well, it made me dream.”Pause.“It’s a strange state,” said Warming.“It’s a sort of complete absence,” said Isbister. “Here’s the body, empty. Notdead a bit, and yet not alive. It’s like a seat vacant and marked ‘engaged.’ Nofeeling, no digestion, no beating of the heart—not a flutter. That doesn’t makeme feel as if there was a man present. In a sense it’s more dead than death, forthese doctors tell me that even the hair has stopped growing. Now with theproper dead, the hair will go on growing—”“I know,” said Warming, with a flash of pain in his expression.They peered through the glass again. Graham was indeed in a strange state, inthe flaccid phase of a trance, but a trance unprecedented in medical history.Trances had lasted for as much as a year before—but at the end of that time ithad ever been a waking or a death; sometimes first one and then the other.Isbister noted the marks the physicians had made in injecting nourishment, forthat device had been resorted to to postpone collapse; he pointed them out toWarming, who had been trying not to see them.“And while he has been lying here,” said Isbister, with the zest of a lifefreely spent, “I have changed my plans in life; married, raised a family, myeldest lad—I hadn’t begun to think of sons then—is an American citizen, andlooking forward to leaving Harvard. There’s a touch of grey in my hair. And thisman, not a day older nor wiser (practically) than I was in my downy days. It’scurious to think of.”Warming turned. “And I have grown old too. I played cricket with him when I wasstill only a lad. And he looks a young man still. Yellow perhaps. But that is ayoung man nevertheless.”“And there’s been the War,” said Isbister.“From beginning to end.”“And these Martians.”“I’ve understood,” said Isbister after a pause, “that he had some moderateproperty of his own?”“That is so,” said Warming. He coughed primly. “As it happens—I have charge ofit.”“Ah!” Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: “No doubt—his keep here is notexpensive—no doubt it will have improved— accumulated?”“It has. He will wake up very much better off—if he wakes— than when he slept.”“As a business man,” said Isbister, “that thought has naturally been in my mind.I have, indeed, sometimes thought that, speaking commercially, of course, thissleep may be a very good thing for him. That he knows what he is about, so tospeak, in being insensible so long. If he had lived straight on—”“I doubt if he would have premeditated as much,” said Warming. “He was not afar-sighted man. In fact—”“Yes?”“We differed on that point. I stood to him somewhat in the relation of aguardian. You have probably seen enough of affairs to recognise thatoccasionally a certain friction—. But even if that was the case, there is adoubt whether he will ever wake. This sleep exhausts slowly, but it exhausts.Apparently he is sliding slowly, very slowly and tediously, down a long slope,if you can understand me?”“It will be a pity to lose his surprise. There’s been a lot of change thesetwenty years. It’s Rip Van Winkle come real.”“It’s Bellamy,” said Warming. “There has been a lot of change certainly. And,among other changes; I have changed. I am an old man.”Isbister hesitated, and then feigned a belated surprise. “I shouldn’t havethought it.”“I was forty-three when his bankers—you remember you wired to his bankers—senton to me.”“I got their address from the cheque book in his pocket,” said Isbister.“Well, the addition is not difficult,” said Warming.There was another pause, and then Isbister gave way to an unavoidable curiosity.“He may go on for years yet,” he said, and had a moment of hesitation. “We haveto consider that. His affairs, you know, may fall some day into the handsof—someone else, you know.”“That, if you will believe me, Mr. Isbister, is one of the problems mostconstantly before my mind. We happen to be—as a matter of fact, there are novery trustworthy connexions of ours. It is a grotesque and unprecedentedposition.”“It is,” said Isbister. “As a matter of fact, it’s a case for a public trustee,if only we had such a functionary.”“It seems to me it’s a case for some public body, some practically undyingguardian. If he really is going on living—as the doctors, some of them, think.As a matter of fact, I have gone to one or two public men about it. But, so far,nothing has been done.”“It wouldn’t be a bad idea to hand him over to some public body—the BritishMuseum Trustees, or the Royal College of Physicians. Sounds a bit odd, ofcourse, but the whole situation is odd.”“The difficulty is to induce them to take him.”“Red tape, I suppose?”“Partly.”Pause. “It’s a curious business, certainly,” said Isbister. “And compoundinterest has a way of mounting up.”“It has,” said Warming. “And now the gold supplies are running short there is atendency towards . . . appreciation.”“I’ve felt that,” said Isbister with a grimace. “But it makes it better forhim.”“If he wakes.”“If he wakes,” echoed Isbister. “Do you notice the pinched-in look of his nose,and the way in which his eyelids sink?”Warming looked and thought for a space. “I doubt if he will wake,” he said atlast.“I never properly understood,” said Isbister, “what it was brought this on. Hetold me something about overstudy. I’ve often been curious.”“He was a man of considerable gifts, but spasmodic, emotional. He had gravedomestic troubles, divorced his wife, in fact, and it was as a relief from that,I think, that he took up politics of the rabid sort. He was a fanaticalRadical—a Socialist—or typical Liberal, as they used to call themselves, of theadvanced school. Energetic—flighty—undisciplined. Overwork upon a controversydid this for him. I remember the pamphlet he wrote—a curious production. Wild,whirling stuff. There were one or two prophecies. Some of them are alreadyexploded, some of them are established facts. But for the most part to read sucha thesis is to realise how full the world is of unanticipated things. He willhave much to learn, much to unlearn, when he wakes. If ever a waking comes.”“I’d give anything to be there,” said Isbister, “just to hear what he would sayto it all.”“So would I,” said Warming. “Aye! so would I,” with an old man’s sudden turn toself pity. “But I shall never see him wake.”He stood looking thoughtfully at the waxen figure. “He will never wake,” he saidat last. He sighed. “He will never wake again.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3THE AWAKENINGBut Warming was wrong in that. An awakening came.What a wonderfully complex thing! this simple seeming unity—the self ! Who cantrace its reintegration as morning after morning we awaken, the flux andconfluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuilding, the dim firststirrings of the soul, the growth and synthesis of the unconscious to thesub-conscious, the sub-conscious to dawning consciousness, until at last werecognise ourselves again. And as it happens to most of us after the night’ssleep, so it was with Graham at the end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud ofsensation taking shape, a cloudy dreariness, and he found himself vaguelysomewhere, recumbent, faint, but alive.The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to traverse vast gulfs, to occupyepochs. Gigantic dreams that were terrible realities at the time, left vagueperplexing memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as if from anotherplanet. There was a distinct impression, too, of a momentous conversation, of aname—he could not tell what name—that was subsequently to recur, of some queerlong-forgotten sensation of vein and muscle, of a feeling of vast hopelesseffort, the effort of a man near drowning in darkness. Then came a panorama ofdazzling unstable confluent scenes.Graham became aware his eyes were open and regarding some unfamiliar thing.It was something white, the edge of something, a frame of wood. He moved hishead slightly, following the contour of this shape. It went up beyond the top ofhis eyes. He tried to think where he might be. Did it matter, seeing he was sowretched? The colour of his thoughts was a dark depression. He felt thefeatureless misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn. He had anuncertain sense of whispers and footsteps hastily receding.The movement of his head involved a perception of extreme physical weakness. Hesupposed he was in bed in the hotel at the place in the valley—but he could notrecall that white edge. He must have slept. He remembered now that he had wantedto sleep. He recalled the cliff and waterfall again, and then recollectedsomething about talking to a passer-by.How long had he slept? What was that sound of pattering feet? And that rise andfall, like the murmur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a languid hand to reachhis watch from the chair whereon it was his habit to place it, and touched somesmooth hard surface like glass. This was so unexpected that it startled himextremely. Quite suddenly he rolled over, stared for a moment, and struggledinto a sitting position. The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left himgiddy and weak—and amazed.He rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings was confusing but his mindwas quite clear—evidently his sleep had benefitted him. He was not in a bed atall as he understood the word, but lying naked on a very soft and yieldingmattress, in a trough of dark glass. The mattress was partly transparent, a facthe observed with a strange sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirrorreflecting him greyly. About his arm—and he saw with a shock that his skin wasstrangely dry and yellow—was bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound socunningly that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And this strangebed was placed in a case of greenish coloured glass (as it seemed to him), a barin the white framework of which had first arrested his attention. In the cornerof the case was a stand of glittering and delicately made apparatus, for themost part quite strange appliances, though a maximum and minimum thermometer wasrecognisable.The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance which surrounded him onevery hand obscured what lay behind, but he perceived it was a vast apartment ofsplendid appearance, and with a very large and simple white archway facing him.Close to the walls of the cage were articles of furniture, a table covered witha silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a couple of graceful chairs,and on the table a number of dishes with substances piled on them, a bottle andtwo glasses. He realised that he was intensely hungry.He could see no human being, and after a period of hesitation scrambled off thetranslucent mattress and tried to stand on the clean white floor of his littleapartment. He had miscalculated his strength, however, and staggered and put hishand against the glass-like pane before him to steady himself. For a moment itresisted his hand, bending outward like a distended bladder, then it broke witha slight report and vanished—a pricked bubble. He reeled out into the generalspace of the hall, greatly astonished. He caught at the table to save himself,knocking one of the glasses to the floor—it rang but did not break—and sat downin one of the armchairs.When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining glass from the bottle anddrank—a colourless liquid it was, but not water, with a pleasing faint aroma andtaste and a quality of immediate support and stimulus. He put down the vesseland looked about him.The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence now that the greenishtransparency that had intervened was removed. The archway he saw led to a flightof steps, going downward without the intermediation of a door, to a spacioustransverse passage. This passage ran between polished pillars of somewhite-veined substance of deep ultramarine; and along it came the sound of humanmovements and voices and a deep undeviating droning note. He sat, now fullyawake, listening alertly, forgetting the viands in his attention.Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked, and casting about him forcovering, saw a long black robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him. This hewrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.His mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he had slept, and had beenremoved in his sleep. But where? And who were those people, the distant crowdbeyond the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and partially drankanother glass of the colourless fluid.What was this place?—this place that to his senses seemed subtly quivering likea thing alive? He looked about him at the clean and beautiful form of theapartment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof was broken in one placeby a circular shaft full of light, and, as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadowblotted it out and passed, and came again and passed. “Beat, beat,” thatsweeping shadow had a note of its own in the subdued tumult that filled the air.He would have called out, but only a little sound came into his throat. Then hestood up, and, with the uncertain steps of a drunkard, made his way towards thearchway. He staggered down the steps, tripped on the corner of the black cloakhe had wrapped about himself, and saved himself by catching at one of the bluepillars.The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple, and ended remotely in arailed space like a balcony, brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze, aspace like the interior of some gigantic building. Beyond and remote were vastand vague architectural forms. The tumult of voices rose now loud and clear, andon the balcony and with their backs to him, gesticulating and apparently inanimated conversation, were three figures, richly dressed in loose and easygarments of bright soft colourings. The noise of a great multitude of peoplepoured up over the balcony, and once it seemed the top of a banner passed, andonce some brightly coloured object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up intothe air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The shouts sounded likeEnglish, there was a reiteration of “Wake!” He heard some indistinct shrill cry,and abruptly these three men began laughing.“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed one—a red-haired man in a short purple robe. “When theSleeper wakes—When!”He turned his eyes full of merriment along the passage. His face changed, thewhole man changed, became rigid. The other two turned swiftly at his exclamationand stood motionless. Their faces assumed an expression of consternation, anexpression that deepened into awe.Suddenly Graham’s knees bent beneath him, his arm against the pillar collapsedlimply, he staggered forward and fell upon his face."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4THE SOUND OF A TUMULTGraham’s last impression before he fainted was of a clamourous ringing of bells.He learnt afterwards that he was insensible, hanging between life and death, forthe better part of an hour. When he recovered his senses, he was back on histranslucent couch, and there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat. The darkapparatus, he perceived, had been removed from his arm, which was bandaged. Thewhite framework was still about him, but the greenish transparent substance thathad filled it was altogether gone. A man in a deep violet robe, one of those whohad been on the balcony, was looking keenly into his face.Remote but insistent was a clamour of bells and confused sounds, that suggestedto his mind the picture of a great number of people shouting together. Somethingseemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddenly closed.Graham moved his head. “What does this all mean?” he said slowly. “Where am I?”He saw the red-haired man who had been first to discover him. A voice seemed tobe asking what he had said, and was abruptly stilled.The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking English with a slightlyforeign accent, or so at least it seemed to the Sleeper’s ears, “You are quitesafe. You were brought hither from where you fell asleep. It is quite safe. Youhave been here some time—sleeping. In a trance.”He said something further that Graham could not hear, and a little phial washanded across to him. Graham felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist played overhis forehead for a moment, and his sense of refreshment increased. He closed hiseyes in satisfaction.“Better?” asked the man in violet, as Graham’s eyes reopened. He was apleasant-faced man of thirty, perhaps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and a claspof gold at the neck of his violet robe.“Yes,” said Graham.“You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic trance. You have heard?Catalepsy? It may seem strange to you at first, but I can assure you everythingis well.”Graham did not answer, but these words served their reassuring purpose. His eyeswent from face to face of the three people about him. They were regarding himstrangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in Cornwall, but he could not squarethese things with that impression.A matter that had been in his mind during his last waking moments at Boscastlerecurred, a thing resolved upon and somehow neglected. He cleared his throat.“Have you wired my cousin?” he asked. “E. Warming, 27, Chancery Lane?”They were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat it. “What an odd blurr inhis accent!” whispered the red-haired man. “Wire, sir?” said the young man withthe flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.“He means send an electric telegram,” volunteered the third, a pleasant-facedyouth of nineteen or twenty. The flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension.“How stupid of me! You may be sure everything shall be done, sir,” he said toGraham. “I am afraid it would be difficult to—wire to your cousin. He is not inLondon now. But don’t trouble about arrangements yet; you have been asleep avery long time and the important thing is to get over that, sir.” (Grahamconcluded the word was sir, but this man pronounced it “Sire.”)“Oh!” said Graham, and became quiet.It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people in unfamiliar dress knewwhat they were about. Yet they were odd and the room was odd. It seemed he wasin some newly established place. He had a sudden flash of suspicion. Surely thiswasn’t some hall of public exhibition! If it was he would give Warming a pieceof his mind. But it scarcely had that character. And in a place of publicexhibition he would not have discovered himself naked.Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had happened. There was noperceptible interval of suspicion, no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly he knewthat his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if by some processes ofthought reading he interpreted the awe in the faces that peered into his. Helooked at them strangely, full of intense emotion. It seemed they read his eyes.He framed his lips to speak and could not. A queer impulse to hide his knowledgecame into his mind almost at the moment of his discovery. He looked at his barefeet, regarding them silently. His impulse to speak passed. He was tremblingexceedingly.They gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluorescence and a meaty taste,and the assurance of returning strength grew.“That—that makes me feel better,” he said hoarsely, and there were murmurs ofrespectful approval. He knew now quite clearly. He made to speak again, andagain he could not.He pressed his throat and tried a third time. “How long?” he asked in a levelvoice. “How long have I been asleep?”“Some considerable time,” said the flaxen-bearded man, glancing quickly at theothers.“How long?”“A very long time.”“Yes—yes,” said Graham, suddenly testy. “But I want— Is it— it is—some years?Many years? There was something—I forget what. I feel—confused. But you—” Hesobbed. “You need not fence with me. How long—?”He stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his eyes with his knuckles andsat waiting for an answer.They spoke in undertones.“Five or six?” he asked faintly. “More?”“Very much more than that.”“More!”“More.”He looked at them and it seemed as though imps were twitching the muscles of hisface. He looked his question.“Many years,” said the man with the red beard.Graham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped a rheumy tear from his facewith a lean hand. “Many years!” he repeated. He shut his eyes tight, openedthem, and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar thing to another.“How many years?” he asked.“You must be prepared to be surprised.”“Well?”“More than a gross of years.”He was irritated at the strange word. “More than a what? ”Two of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that were made about “decimal” hedid not catch.“How long did you say?” asked Graham. “How long? Don’t look like that. Tell me.”Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught six words: “More than a coupleof centuries.”“What?” he cried, turning on the youth who he thought had spoken. “Who says—?What was that? A couple of centuries! ”“Yes,” said the man with the red beard. “Two hundred years.”Graham repeated the words. He had been prepared to hear of a vast repose, andyet these concrete centuries defeated him.“Two hundred years,” he said again, with the figure of a great gulf opening veryslowly in his mind; and then, “Oh, but—!”They said nothing.“You—did you say—?”“Two hundred years. Two centuries of years,” said the man with the red beard.There was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and saw that what he had heardwas indeed true.“But it can’t be,” he said querulously. “I am dreaming. Trances. Trances don’tlast. That is not right—this is a joke you have played upon me! Tell me—somedays ago, perhaps, I was walking along the coast of Cornwall—?”His voice failed him.The man with the flaxen beard hesitated. “I’m not very strong in history, sir,”he said weakly, and glanced at the others.“That was it, sir,” said the youngster. “Boscastle, in the old Duchy ofCornwall—it’s in the southwest country beyond the dairy meadows. There is ahouse there still. I have been there.”“Boscastle!” Graham turned his eyes to the youngster. “That was it—Boscastle.Little Boscastle. I fell asleep—somewhere there. I don’t exactly remember. Idon’t exactly remember.”He pressed his brows and whispered, “More than two hundred years! ”He began to speak quickly with a twitching face, but his heart was cold withinhim. “But if it is two hundred years, every soul I know, every human being thatever I saw or spoke to before I went to sleep, must be dead.”They did not answer him.“The Queen and the Royal Family, her Ministers, Church and State. High and low,rich and poor, one with another—”“Is there England still?”“That’s a comfort! Is there London?”“This is London, eh? And you are my assistant-custodian; assistant-custodian.And these—? Eh? Assistant-custodians too!”He sat with a gaunt stare on his face. “But why am I here? No! Don’t talk. Bequiet. Let me—”He sat silent, rubbed his eyes, and, uncovering them, found another little glassof pinkish fluid held towards him. He took the dose. It was almost immediatelysustaining. Directly he had taken it he began to weep naturally andrefreshingly.Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed through his tears, a littlefoolishly. “But—two—hun—dred—years!” he said. He grimaced hysterically andcovered up his face again.After a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands hanging over his knees inalmost precisely the same attitude in which Isbister had found him on the cliffat Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick domineering voice, thefootsteps of an advancing personage. “What are you doing? Why was I not warned?Surely you could tell? Someone will suffer for this. The man must be kept quiet.Are the doorways closed? All the doorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet. Hemust not be told. Has he been told anything?”The man with the fair beard made some inaudible remark, and Graham looking overhis shoulder saw approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless man, withaquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very thick black and slightly slopingeyebrows that almost met over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave hisface an oddly formidable expression. He scowled momentarily at Graham and thenhis regard returned to the man with the flaxen beard. “These others,” he said ina voice of extreme irritation. “You had better go.”“Go?” said the red-bearded man.“Certainly—go now. But see the doorways are closed as you go.”The two men addressed turned obediently, after one reluctant glance at Graham,and instead of going through the archway as he expected, walked straight to thedead wall of the apartment opposite the archway. And then came a strange thing;a long strip of this apparently solid wall rolled up with a snap, hung over thetwo retreating men and fell again, and immediately Graham was alone with the newcomer and the purple-robed man with the flaxen beard.For a space the thickset man took not the slightest notice of Graham, butproceeded to interrogate the other—obviously his subordinate—upon the treatmentof their charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only partially intelligible toGraham. The awakening seemed not only a matter of surprise but of consternationand annoyance to him. He was evidently profoundly excited.“You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,” he repeated again andagain. “You must not confuse his mind.”His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed the awakened sleeper with anambiguous expression.“Feel queer?” he asked.“Very.”“The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?”“I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems.”“I suppose so, now.”“In the first place, hadn’t I better have some clothes?”“They—” said the thickset man and stopped, and the flaxenbearded man met his eyeand went away. “You will very speedily have clothes,” said the thickset man.“Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred—?” asked Graham.“They have told you that, have they? Two hundred and three, as a matter offact.”Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eyebrows and depressed mouth.He sat silent for a moment, and then asked a question, “Is there a mill ordynamo near here?” He did not wait for an answer. “Things have changedtremendously, I suppose?” he said.“What is that shouting?” he asked abruptly.“Nothing,” said the thickset man impatiently. “It’s people. You’ll understandbetter later—perhaps. As you say, things have changed.” He spoke shortly, hisbrows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man trying to decide in anemergency. “We must get you clothes and so forth, at any rate. Better wait hereuntil some can come. No one will come near you. You want shaving.”Graham rubbed his chin.The man with the flaxen beard came back towards them, turned suddenly, listenedfor a moment, lifted his eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through thearchway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting grew louder, and thethickset man turned and listened also. He cursed suddenly under his breath, andturned his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly expression. It was a surge ofmany voices, rising and falling, shouting and screaming, and once came a soundlike blows and sharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of drysticks. Graham strained his ears to draw some single thread of sound from thewoven tumult.Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain formula. For a time hedoubted his ears. But surely these were the words: “Show us the Sleeper! Show usthe Sleeper!”The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.“Wild!” he cried, “How do they know? Do they know? Or is it guessing?”There was perhaps an answer.“I can’t come,” said the thickset man; “I have him to see to. But shout from thebalcony.”There was an inaudible reply.“Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you.”He came hurrying back to Graham. “You must have clothes at once,” he said. “Youcannot stop here—and it will be impossible to—”He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered questions after him. In a moment hewas back.“I can’t tell you what is happening. It is too complex to explain. In a momentyou shall have your clothes made. Yes—in a moment. And then I can take you awayfrom here. You will find out our troubles soon enough.”“But those voices. They were shouting—?”“Something about the Sleeper—that’s you. They have some twisted idea. I don’tknow what it is. I know nothing.”A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct mingling of remote noises,and this brusque person sprang to a little group of appliances in the corner ofthe room. He listened for a moment, regarding a ball of crystal, nodded, andsaid a few indistinct words; then he walked to the wall through which the twomen had vanished. It rolled up again like a curtain, and he stood waiting.Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what strength the restorativeshad given him. He thrust one leg over the side of the couch and then the other.His head no longer swam. He could scarcely credit his rapid recovery. He satfeeling his limbs.The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the archway, and as he did so thecage of a lift came sliding down in front of the thickset man, and a lean,grey-bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a tightly-fitting costume of darkgreen, appeared therein.“This is the tailor,” said the thickset man with an introductory gesture. “Itwill never do for you to wear that black. I cannot understand how it got here.But I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid as possible?” he said to the tailor.The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated himself by Graham on the bed. Hismanner was calm, but his eyes were full of curiosity. “You will find thefashions altered, Sire,” he said. He glanced from under his brows at thethickset man.He opened the roller with a quick movement, and a confusion of brilliant fabricspoured out over his knees. “You lived, Sire, in a period essentiallycylindrical—the Victorian. With a tendency to the hemisphere in hats. Circularcurves always. Now—” He flicked out a little appliance the size and appearanceof a keyless watch, whirled the knob, and behold—a little figure in whiteappeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial, walking and turning. The tailor caughtup a pattern of bluish white satin. “That is my conception of your immediatetreatment,” he said.The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of Graham.“We have very little time,” he said.“Trust me,” said the tailor. “My machine follows. What do you think of this?”“What is that?” asked the man from the nineteenth century.“In your days they showed you a fashion-plate,” said the tailor, “but this isour modern development. See here.” The little figure repeated its evolutions,but in a different costume. “Or this,” and with a click another small figure ina more voluminous type of robe marched on to the dial. The tailor was very quickin his movements, and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these things.It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with features of the Chinesetype, clad in coarse pale blue canvas, appeared together with a complicatedmachine, which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the room.Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped, Graham was invited to stand infront of the machine and the tailor muttered some instructions to thecrop-haired lad, who answered in guttural tones and with words Graham did notrecognise. The boy then went to conduct an incomprehensible monologue in thecorner, and the tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminating in littlediscs, pulling them out until the discs were flat against the body of Graham,one at each shoulder blade, one at the elbows, one at the neck and so forth, sothat at last there were, perhaps, two score of them upon his body and limbs. Atthe same time, some other person entered the room by the lift, behind Graham.The tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-sounding rhythmicmovement of parts in the machine, and in another moment he was knocking up thelevers and Graham was released. The tailor replaced his cloak of black, and theman with the flaxen beard proffered him a little glass of some refreshing fluid.Graham saw over the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man regarding him with asingular fixity.The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully, and now turned and wentthrough the archway towards the balcony, from which the noise of a distant crowdstill came in gusts and cadences. The crop-headed lad handed the tailor a rollof the bluish satin and the two began fixing this in the mechanism in a mannerreminiscent of a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine. Thenthey ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless bearings across the room to aremote corner where a twisted cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. Theymade some connexion and the machine became energetic and swift.“What is that doing?” asked Graham, pointing with the empty glass to the busyfigures and trying to ignore the scrutiny of the new comer. “Is that—some sortof force—laid on?”“Yes,” said the man with the flaxen beard.“Who is that ? ” He indicated the archway behind him.The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated, and answered in anundertone, “He is Howard, your chief guardian. You see, Sire,—it’s a littledifficult to explain. The Council appoints a guardian and assistants. This hallhas under certain restrictions been public. In order that people might satisfythemselves. We have barred the doorways for the first time. But I think—if youdon’t mind, I will leave him to explain.”“Odd!” said Graham. “Guardian? Council?” Then turning his back on the new comer,he asked in an undertone, “Why is this man glaring at me? Is he a mesmerist?”“Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist.”“Capillotomist!”“Yes—one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions.”It sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the last phrase with an unsteadymind. “Sixdoz lions?” he said.“Didn’t you have lions? I suppose not. You had the old pounds? They are ourmonetary units.”“But what was that you said—sixdoz?”“Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these little things, have altered.You lived in the days of the decimal system, the Arab system—tens, and littlehundreds and thousands. We have eleven numerals now. We have single figures forboth ten and eleven, two figures for a dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, agreat hundred, you know, a dozen gross a dozand, and a dozand dozand a myriad.Very simple?”“I suppose so,” said Graham. “But about this cap—what was it?”The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his shoulder.“Here are your clothes!” he said. Graham turned round sharply and saw the tailorstanding at his elbow smiling, and holding some palpably new garments over hisarm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one finger, was impelling the complicatedmachine towards the lift by which he had arrived. Graham stared at the completedsuit. “You don’t mean to say—!”“Just made,” said the tailor. He dropped the garments at the feet of Graham,walked to the bed on which Graham had so recently been lying, flung out thetranslucent mattress, and turned up the looking-glass. As he did so a furiousbell summoned the thickset man to the corner. The man with the flaxen beardrushed across to him and then hurried out by the archway.The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple combination garment,stockings, vest, and pants in one, as the thickset man came back from the cornerto meet the man with the flaxen beard returning from the balcony. They beganspeaking quickly in an undertone, their bearing had an unmistakable quality ofanxiety. Over the purple under-garment came a complex but graceful garment ofbluish white, and Graham was clothed in the fashion once more and saw himself,sallow-faced, unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no longer, and insome indefinable unprecedented way graceful.“I must shave,” he said regarding himself in the glass.“In a moment,” said Howard.The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his eyes, reopened them, andwith a lean hand extended, advanced on Graham. Then he stopped, with his handslowly gesticulating, and looked about him.“A seat,” said Howard impatiently, and in a moment the flaxen-bearded man had achair behind Graham. “Sit down, please,” said Howard.Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wild-eyed man he saw the glint ofsteel.“Don’t you understand, Sire?” cried the flaxen-bearded man with hurriedpoliteness. “He is going to cut your hair.”“Oh!” cried Graham enlightened. “But you called him—”“A capillotomist—precisely! He is one of the finest artists in the world.”Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man disappeared. The capillotomistcame forward with graceful gestures, examined Graham’s ears and surveyed him,felt the back of his head, and would have sat down again to regard him but forHoward’s audible impatience. Forthwith with rapid movements and a succession ofdeftly handled implements he shaved Graham’s chin, clipped his moustache, andcut and arranged his hair. All this he did without a word, with something of therapt air of a poet inspired. And as soon as he had finished Graham was handed apair of shoes.Suddenly a loud voice shouted—it seemed from a piece of machinery in the corner—“At once—at once. The people know all over the city. Work is being stopped. Workis being stopped. Wait for nothing, but come.”This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly. By his gestures it seemed toGraham that he hesitated between two directions. Abruptly he went towards thecorner where the apparatus stood about the little crystal ball. As he did so theundertone of tumultuous shouting from the archway that had continued during allthese occurrences rose to a mighty sound, roared as if it were sweeping past,and fell again as if receding swiftly. It drew Graham after it with anirresistible attraction. He glanced at the thickset man, and then obeyed hisimpulse. In two strides he was down the steps and in the passage, and in a scorehe was out upon the balcony upon which the three men had been standing."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5THE MOVING WAYSHe went to the railings of the balcony and stared upward. An exclamation ofsurprise at his appearance, and the movements of a number of people came fromthe spacious area below.His first impression was of overwhelming architecture. The place into which helooked was an aisle of Titanic buildings, curving spaciously in eitherdirection. Overhead mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge width ofthe place, and a tracery of translucent material shut out the sky. Giganticglobes of cool white light shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down throughthe girders and wires. Here and there a gossamer suspension bridge dotted withfoot passengers flung across the chasm and the air was webbed with slendercables. A cliff of edifice hung above him, he perceived as he glanced upward,and the opposite façade was grey and dim and broken by great archings, circularperforations, balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vastwindows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief. Athwart these raninscriptions horizontally and obliquely in an unfamiliar lettering. Here andthere close to the roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened, anddrooped in a steep curve to circular openings on the opposite side of the space,and even as Graham noted these a remote and tiny figure of a man clad in paleblue arrested his attention. This little figure was far overhead across thespace beside the higher fastening of one of these festoons, hanging forward froma little ledge of masonry and handling some well-nigh invisible stringsdependent from the line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent Graham’s heartinto his mouth, this man had rushed down the curve and vanished through a roundopening on the hither side of the way. Graham had been looking up as he came outupon the balcony, and the things he saw above and opposed to him had at firstseized his attention to the exclusion of anything else. Then suddenly hediscovered the roadway! It was not a roadway at all, as Graham understood suchthings, for in the nineteenth century the only roads and streets were beatentracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets of vehicles between narrowfoot-ways. But this roadway was three hundred feet across, and it moved; itmoved, all save the middle, the lowest part. For a moment, the motion dazzledhis mind. Then he understood.Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran swiftly to Graham’s right, anendless flow rushing along as fast as a nineteenth century express train, anendless platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with little interspacesthat permitted it to follow the curvatures of the street. Upon it were seats,and here and there little kiosks, but they swept by too swiftly for him to seewhat might be therein. From this nearest and swiftest platform a series ofothers descended to the centre of the space. Each moved to the right, eachperceptibly slower than the one above it, but the difference in pace was smallenough to permit anyone to step from any platform to the one adjacent, and sowalk uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless middle way. Beyond thismiddle way was another series of endless platforms rushing with varying pace toGraham’s left. And seated in crowds upon the two widest and swiftest platforms,or stepping from one to another down the steps, or swarming over the centralspace, was an innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of people.“You must not stop here,” shouted Howard suddenly at his side. “You must comeaway at once.”Graham made no answer. He heard without hearing. The platforms ran with a roarand the people were shouting. He perceived women and girls with flowing hair,beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the breasts. These first came outof the confusion. Then he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscopeof costume was the pale blue that the tailor’s boy had worn. He became aware ofcries of “The Sleeper. What has happened to the Sleeper?” and it seemed asthough the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered with the palebuff of human faces, and then still more thickly. He saw pointing fingers. Heperceived that the motionless central area of this huge arcade just opposite tothe balcony was densely crowded with blue-clad people. Some sort of struggle hadsprung into life. People seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on eitherside, and carried away against their will. They would spring off so soon as theywere beyond the thick of the confusion, and run back towards the conflict.“It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper,” shouted voices. “That is neverthe Sleeper,” shouted others. More and more faces were turned to him. At theintervals along this central area Graham noted openings, pits, apparently theheads of staircases going down with people ascending out of them and descendinginto them. The struggle it seemed centred about the one of these nearest to him.People were running down the moving platforms to this, leaping dexterously fromplatform to platform. The clustering people on the higher platforms seemed todivide their interest between this point and the balcony. A number of sturdylittle figures clad in a uniform of bright red, and working methodicallytogether, were employed it seemed in preventing access to this descendingstaircase. About them a crowd was rapidly accumulating. Their brilliant colourcontrasted vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists, for the strugglewas indisputable.He saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear and shaking his arm. Andthen suddenly Howard was gone and he stood alone.He perceived that the cries of “The Sleeper!” grew in volume, and that thepeople on the nearer platform were standing up. The nearer swifter platform heperceived was empty to the right of him, and far across the space the platformrunning in the opposite direction was coming crowded and passing away bare. Withincredible swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space before hiseyes; a dense swaying mass of people, and the shouts grew from a fitful cryingto a voluminous incessant clamour: “The Sleeper! The Sleeper!” and yells andcheers, a waving of garments and cries of “Stop the ways!” They were also cryinganother name strange to Graham. It sounded like “Ostrog.” The slower platformswere soon thick with active people, running against the movement so as to keepthemselves opposite to him.“Stop the ways,” they cried. Agile figures ran up swiftly from the centre to theswift road nearest to him, were borne rapidly past him, shouting strange,unintelligible things, and ran back obliquely to the central way. One thing hedistinguished: “It is indeed the Sleeper. It is indeed the Sleeper,” theytestified.For a space Graham stood without a movement. Then he became vividly aware thatall this concerned him. He was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he bowed,and, seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his arm. He was astonished at theviolence of uproar that this provoked. The tumult about the descending stairwayrose to furious violence. He became aware of crowded balconies, of men slidingalong ropes, of men in trapeze-like seats hurling athwart the space. He heardvoices behind him, a number of people descending the steps through the archway;he suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was back again and gripping hisarm painfully, and shouting inaudibly in his ear.He turned, and Howard’s face was white. “Come back,” he heard. “They will stopthe ways. The whole city will be in confusion.”He perceived a number of men hurrying along the passage of blue pillars behindHoward, the red-haired man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall man in vividvermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and all these people hadanxious eager faces.“Get him away,” cried Howard.“But why?” said Graham. “I don’t see—”“You must come away!” said the man in red in a resolute voice. His face and eyeswere resolute, too. Graham’s glances went from face to face, and he was suddenlyaware of that most disagreeable flavour in life, compulsion. Some one grippedhis arm. . . . He was being dragged away. It seemed as though the tumultsuddenly became two, as if half the shouts that had come in from this wonderfulroadway had sprung into the passages of the great building behind him.Marvelling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to resist, Graham was halfled, half thrust, along the passage of blue pillars, and suddenly he foundhimself alone with Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE HALL OF THE ATLASFrom the moment when the tailor had bowed his farewell to the moment when Grahamfound himself in the lift, was altogether barely five minutes. And as yet thehaze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as yet the initialstrangeness of his being alive at all in this remote age touched everything withwonder, with a sense of the irrational, with something of the quality of arealistic dream. He was still detached, an astonished spectator, still but halfinvolved in life. What he had seen, and especially the last crowded tumult,framed in the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like a thingwitnessed from the box of a theatre. “I don’t understand,” he said. “What wasthe trouble? My mind is in a whirl. Why were they shouting? What is the danger?”“We have our troubles,” said Howard. His eyes avoided Graham’s enquiry. “This isa time of unrest. And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now, has asort of connexion—”He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his breathing. He stoppedabruptly.“I don’t understand,” said Graham.“It will be clearer later,” said Howard.He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the progress of the lift slow.“I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen my way about a little,”said Graham puzzled. “It will be—it is bound to be perplexing. At present it isall so strange. Anything seems possible. Anything. In the details even. Yourcounting, I understand, is different.”The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow but very long passagebetween high walls, along which ran an extraordinary number of tubes and bigcables.“What a huge place this is!” said Graham. “Is it all one building? What place isit?”“This is one of the city ways for various public services. Light and so forth.”“Was it a social trouble—that—in the great roadway place? How are you governed?Have you still a police?”“Several,” said Howard.“Several?”“About fourteen.”“I don’t understand.”“Very probably not. Our social order will probably seem very complex to you. Totell you the truth, I don’t understand it myself very clearly. Nobody does. Youwill, perhaps—bye and bye. We have to go to the Council.”Graham’s attention was divided between the urgent necessity of his inquiries andthe people in the passages and halls they were traversing. For a moment his mindwould be concentrated upon Howard and the halting answers he made, and then hewould lose the thread in response to some vivid unexpected impression. Along thepassages, in the halls, half the people seemed to be men in the red uniform. Thepale blue canvas that had been so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did notappear. Invariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and Howard as theypassed.He had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and there were a number ofgirls sitting on low seats, and as though in a class. He saw no teacher, butonly a novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice proceeded. The girlsregarded him and his conductor, he thought, with curiosity and astonishment. Buthe was hurried on before he could form a clear idea of the gathering. He judgedthey knew Howard and not himself, and that they wondered who he was. ThisHoward, it seemed, was a person of importance. But then he was also merelyGraham’s guardian. That was odd.There came a passage in twilight, and into this passage a footway hung so thathe could see the feet and ankles of people going to and fro thereon, but no moreof them. Then vague impressions of galleries and of casual astonished passers-byturning round to stare after the two of them with their red-clad guard.The stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was only temporary. He wasspeedily fatigued by this excessive haste. He asked Howard to slacken his speed.Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the great street space, butthis was glazed and did not open, and they were too high for him to see themoving platforms below. But he saw people going to and fro along cables andalong strange, frail-looking bridges.And thence they passed across the street and at a vast height above it. Theycrossed by means of a narrow bridge closed in with glass, so clear that it madehim giddy even to remember it. The floor of it also was of glass. From hismemory of the cliffs between New Quay and Boscastle, so remote in time, and sorecent in his experience, it seemed to him that they must be near four hundredfeet above the moving ways. He stopped, looked down between his legs upon theswarming blue and red multitudes, minute and foreshortened, struggling andgesticulating still towards the little balcony far below, a little toy balcony,it seemed, where he had so recently been standing. A thin haze and the glare ofthe mighty globes of light obscured everything. A man seated in a littleopenwork cradle shot by from some point still higher than the little narrowbridge, rushing down a cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling. Grahamstopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger vanish in a great circularopening below, and then his eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle.Along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of red spots. This broke upinto individuals as it approached the balcony, and went pouring down the slowerways towards the dense struggling crowd on the central area. These men in redappeared to be armed with sticks or truncheons; they seemed to be striking andthrusting. A great shouting, cries of wrath, screaming, burst out and came up toGraham, faint and thin. “Go on,” cried Howard, laying hands on him.Another man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly glanced up to see whence hecame, and beheld through the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders,dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of windmills, and between themglimpses of a remote and pallid sky. Then Howard had thrust him forward acrossthe bridge, and he was in a little narrow passage decorated with geometricalpatterns.“I want to see more of that,” cried Graham, resisting.“No, no,” cried Howard, still gripping his arm. “This way. You must go thisway.” And the men in red following them seemed ready to enforce his orders.Some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black and yellow appeared downthe passage, and one hastened to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed adoor to Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found himself in a galleryoverhanging the end of a great chamber. The attendant in black and yellowcrossed this, thrust up a second shutter and stood waiting.This place had the appearance of an ante-room. He saw a number of people in thecentral space, and at the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the topof a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving a glimpse of some stilllarger hall beyond. He perceived white men in red and other negroes in black andyellow standing stiffly about those portals.As they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from below, “The Sleeper,” andwas aware of a turning of heads, a hum of observation. They entered anotherlittle passage in the wall of this ante-chamber, and then he found himself on aniron-railed gallery of metal that passed round the side of the great hall he hadalready seen through the curtains. He entered the place at the corner, so thathe received the fullest impression of its huge proportions. The black in thewasp uniform stood aside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valvebehind him.Compared with any of the places Graham had seen thus far, this second hallappeared to be decorated with extreme richness. On a pedestal at the remoterend, and more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a gigantic white figureof Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe upon his bowed shoulders. It was thefirst thing to strike his attention, it was so vast, so patiently and painfullyreal, so white and simple. Save for this figure and for a dais in the centre,the wide floor of the place was a shining vacancy. The dais was remote in thegreatness of the area; it would have looked a mere slab of metal had it not beenfor the group of seven men who stood about a table on it, and gave an inkling ofits proportions. They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to havearisen that moment from their seats, and they were regarding Graham steadfastly.At the end of the table he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances.Howard led him along the end gallery until they were opposite this mightylabouring figure. Then he stopped. The two men in red who had followed them intothe gallery came and stood on either hand of Graham.“You must remain here,” murmured Howard, “for a few moments,” and, withoutwaiting for a reply, hurried away along the gallery.“But, why—? ” began Graham.He moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path obstructed by one of the menin red. “You have to wait here, Sire,” said the man in red.“Why?”“Orders, Sire.”“Whose orders?”“Our orders, Sire.”Graham looked his exasperation.“What place is this?” he said presently. “Who are those men?”“They are the lords of the Council, Sire.”“What Council?”“The Council.”“Oh!” said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual attempt at the other man,went to the railing and stared at the distant men in white, who stood watchinghim and whispering together.The Council? He perceived there were now eight, though how the new comer hadarrived he had not observed. They made no gestures of greeting; they stoodregarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of men might have stood inthe street regarding a distant balloon that had suddenly floated into view. Whatcouncil could it be that gathered there, that little body of men beneath thesignificant white Atlas, secluded from every eavesdropper in this impressivespaciousness? And why should he be brought to them, and be looked at strangelyand spoken of inaudibly? Howard appeared beneath, walking quickly across thepolished floor towards them. As he drew near he bowed and performed certainpeculiar movements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then he ascended thesteps of the dais, and stood by the apparatus at the end of the table.Graham watched that visible inaudible conversation. Occasionally, one of thewhite-robed men would glance towards him. He strained his ears in vain. Thegesticulation of two of the speakers became animated. He glanced from them tothe passive faces of his attendants. . . . When he looked again Howard wasextending his hands and moving his head like a man who protests. He wasinterrupted, it seemed, by one of the white-robed men rapping the table.The conversation lasted an interminable time to Graham’s sense. His eyes rose tothe still giant at whose feet the Council sat. Thence they wandered at last tothe walls of the hall. It was decorated in long painted panels of aquasi-Japanese type, many of them very beautiful. These panels were grouped in agreat and elaborate framing of dark metal, which passed into the metalliccaryatidae of the galleries, and the great structural lines of the interior. Thefacile grace of these panels enhanced the mighty white effort that laboured inthe centre of the scheme. Graham’s eyes came back to the Council, and Howard wasdescending the steps. As he drew nearer his features could be distinguished, andGraham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his cheeks. His countenance wasstill disturbed when presently he reappeared along the gallery.“This way,” he said concisely, and they went on in silence to a little door thatopened at their approach. The two men in red stopped on either side of thisdoor. Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing back, saw thewhite-robed Council still standing in a close group and looking at him. Then thedoor closed behind him with a heavy thud, and for the first time since hisawakening he was in silence. The floor, even, was noiseless to his feet.Howard opened another door, and they were in the first of two contiguouschambers furnished in white and green. “What Council was that?” began Graham.“What were they discussing? What have they to do with me?” Howard closed thedoor carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and said something in an undertone. Hewalked slantingways across the room and turned, blowing out his cheeks again.“Ugh!” he grunted, a man relieved.Graham stood regarding him.“You must understand,” began Howard abruptly, avoiding Graham’s eyes, “that oursocial order is very complex. A half explanation, a bare unqualified statementwould give you false impressions. As a matter of fact—it is a case of compoundinterest partly—your small fortune, and the fortune of your cousin Warming whichwas left to you—and certain other beginnings— have become very considerable. Andin other ways that will be hard for you to understand, you have become a personof significance—of very considerable significance—involved in the world’saffairs.”He stopped.“Yes?” said Graham.“We have grave social troubles.”“Yes?”“Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, it is advisable to seclude youhere.”“Keep me prisoner!” exclaimed Graham.“Well—to ask you to keep in seclusion.”Graham turned on him. “This is strange!” he said.“No harm will be done you.”“No harm!”“But you must be kept here—”“While I learn my position, I presume.”“Precisely.”“Very well then. Begin. Why harm?”“Not now.”“Why not?”“It is too long a story, Sire.”“All the more reason I should begin at once. You say I am a person ofimportance. What was that shouting I heard? Why is a great multitude shoutingand excited because my trance is over, and who are the men in white in that hugecouncil chamber?”“All in good time, Sire,” said Howard. “But not crudely, not crudely. This isone of those flimsy times when no man has a settled mind. Your awakening. No oneexpected your awakening. The Council is consulting.”“What council?”“The Council you saw.”Graham made a petulant movement. “This is not right,” he said. “I should be toldwhat is happening.”“You must wait. Really you must wait.”Graham sat down abruptly. “I suppose since I have waited so long to resumelife,” he said, “that I must wait a little longer.”“That is better,” said Howard. “Yes, that is much better. And I must leave youalone. For a space. While I attend the discussion in the Council. . . . I amsorry.”He went towards the noiseless door, hesitated and vanished.Graham walked to the door, tried it, found it securely fastened in some way henever came to understand, turned about, paced the room restlessly, made thecircuit of the room, and sat down. He remained sitting for some time with foldedarms and knitted brow, biting his finger nails and trying to piece together thekaleidoscopic impressions of this first hour of awakened life; the vastmechanical spaces, the endless series of chambers and passages, the greatstruggle that roared and splashed through these strange ways, the little groupof remote unsympathetic men beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard’s mysteriousbehaviour. There was an inkling of some vast inheritance already in his mind—avast inheritance perhaps misapplied—of some unprecedented importance andopportunity. What had he to do? And this room’s secluded silence was eloquent ofimprisonment!It came into Graham’s mind with irresistible conviction that this series ofmagnificent impressions was a dream. He tried to shut his eyes and succeeded,but that time-honoured device led to no awakening.Presently he began to touch and examine all the unfamiliar appointments of thetwo small rooms in which he found himself.In a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and stopped astonished. He wasclad in a graceful costume of purple and bluish white, with a little greyshotbeard trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked now with bands ofgrey, arranged over his forehead in an unfamiliar but graceful manner. He seemeda man of five-and-forty perhaps. For a moment he did not perceive this washimself.A flash of laughter came with the recognition. “To call on old Warming likethis!” he exclaimed, “and make him take me out to lunch!”Then he thought of meeting first one and then another of the few familiaracquaintances of his early manhood, and in the midst of his amusement realisedthat every soul with whom he might jest had died many score of years ago. Thethought smote him abruptly and keenly; he stopped short, the expression of hisface changed to a white consternation.The tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and the huge façade of thatwonderful street reasserted itself. The shouting multitudes came back clear andvivid, and those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councillors in white. He felthimself a little figure, very small and ineffectual, pitifully conspicuous. Andall about him, the world was—strange."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7IN THE SILENT ROOMSPresently Graham resumed his examination of his apartments. Curiosity kept himmoving in spite of his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived, was high, and itsceiling dome shaped, with an oblong aperture in the centre, opening into afunnel in which a wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating, apparently drivingthe air up the shaft. The faint humming note of its easy motion was the onlyclear sound in that quiet place. As these vans sprang up one after the other,Graham could get transient glimpses of the sky. He was surprised to see a star.This drew his attention to the fact that the bright lighting of these rooms wasdue to a multitude of very faint glow lamps set about the cornices. There wereno windows. And he began to recall that along all the vast chambers and passageshe had traversed with Howard he had observed no windows at all. Had there beenwindows? There were windows on the street indeed, but were they for light? Orwas the whole city lit day and night for evermore, so that there was no nightthere?And another thing dawned upon him. There was no fireplace in either room. Wasthe season summer, and were these merely summer apartments, or was the wholecity uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested in these questions, beganexamining the smooth texture of the walls, the simply constructed bed, theingenious arrangements by which the labour of bedroom service was practicallyabolished. And over everything was a curious absence of deliberate ornament, abare grace of form and colour, that he found very pleasing to the eye. Therewere several very comfortable chairs, a light table on silent runners carryingseveral bottles of fluids and glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substancelike jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no newspapers, no writingmaterials. “The world has changed indeed,” he said.He observed one entire side of the outer room was set with rows of peculiardouble cylinders inscribed with green lettering on white that harmonized withthe decorative scheme of the room, and in the centre of this side projected alittle apparatus about a yard square and having a white smooth face to the room.A chair faced this. He had a transitory idea that these cylinders might bebooks, or a modern substitute for books, but at first it did not seem so.The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first sight it seemed likeRussian. Then he noticed a suggestion of mutilated English about certain of thewords.“oi Man huwdbi Kin,” forced itself on him as “The Man who would be King.”“Phonetic spelling,” he said. He remembered reading a story with that title,then he recalled the story vividly, one of the best stories in the world. Butthis thing before him was not a book as he understood it. He puzzled out thetitles of two adjacent cylinders. “The Heart of Darkness,” he had never heard ofbefore nor “The Madonna of the Future”—no doubt if they were indeed stories,they were by post Victorian authors.He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time and replaced it. Then heturned to the square apparatus and examined that. He opened a sort of lid andfound one of the double cylinders within, and on the upper edge a little studlike the stud of an electric bell. He pressed this and a rapid clicking beganand ceased. He became aware of voices and music, and noticed a play of colour onthe smooth front face. He suddenly realised what this might be, and stepped backto regard it.On the flat surface was now a little picture, very vividly coloured, and in thispicture were figures that moved. Not only did they move, but they wereconversing in clear small voices. It was exactly like reality viewed through aninverted opera glass and heard through a long tube. His interest was seized atonce by the situation, which presented a man pacing up and down and vociferatingangry things to a pretty but petulant woman. Both were in the picturesquecostume that seemed so strange to Graham. “I have worked,” said the man, “butwhat have you been doing?”“Ah!” said Graham. He forgot everything else, and sat down in the chair. Withinfive minutes he heard himself named, heard “when the Sleeper wakes,” usedjestingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed himself by, a thingremote and incredible. But in a little while he knew those two people likeintimate friends.At last the miniature drama came to an end, and the square face of the apparatuswas blank again.It was a strange world into which he had been permitted to see, unscrupulous,pleasure seeking, energetic, subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle;there were allusions he did not understand, incidents that conveyed strangesuggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of dubious enlightenment. The bluecanvas that bulked so largely in his first impression of the city ways appearedagain and again as the costume of the common people. He had no doubt the storywas contemporary, and its intense realism was undeniable. And the end had been atragedy that oppressed him. He sat staring at the blankness.He started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so absorbed in the latter-daysubstitute for a novel, that he awoke to the little green and white room withmore than a touch of the surprise of his first awakening.He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own wonder-land. The clearness ofthe kinetoscope drama passed, and the struggle in the vast place of streets, theambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking hour, came back. These peoplehad spoken of the Council with suggestions of a vague universality of power. Andthey had spoken of the Sleeper; it had not really struck him vividly at the timethat he was the Sleeper. He had to recall precisely what they had said. . . .He walked into the bedroom and peered up through the quick intervals of therevolving fan. As the fan swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise of machinerycame in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence. Though the perpetual day stillirradiated his apartments, he perceived the little intermittent strip of sky wasnow deep blue—black almost, with a dust of little stars. . . .He resumed his examination of the rooms. He could find no way of opening thepadded door, no bell nor other means of calling for attendance. His feeling ofwonder was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for information. He wantedto know exactly how he stood to these new things. He tried to compose himself towait until someone came to him. Presently he became restless and eager forinformation, for distraction, for fresh sensations.He went back to the apparatus in the other room, and had soon puzzled out themethod of replacing the cylinders by others. As he did so, it came into his mindthat it must be these little appliances had fixed the language so that it wasstill clear and understandable after two hundred years. The haphazard cylindershe substituted displayed a musical fantasia. At first it was beautiful, and thenit was sensuous. He presently recognized what appeared to him to be an alteredversion of the story of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the renderingwas realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did not go to aVenusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What was a Pleasure City? A dream, surely,the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.He became interested, curious. The story developed with a flavour of strangelytwisted sentimentality. Suddenly he did not like it. He liked it less as itproceeded.He had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pictures, no idealisations, butphotographed realities. He wanted no more of the twenty-second centuryVenusberg. He forgot the part played by the model in nineteenth century art, andgave way to an archaic indignation. He rose, angry and half ashamed at himselffor witnessing this thing even in solitude. He pulled forward the apparatus, andwith some violence sought for a means of stopping its action. Something snapped.A violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the thing was still. When heattempted next day to replace these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, hefound the apparatus broken. . . .He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced to and fro, struggling withintolerable vast impressions. The things he had derived from the cylinders andthe things he had seen, conflicted, confused him. It seemed to him the mostamazing thing of all that in his thirty years of life he had never tried toshape a picture of these coming times. “We were making the future,” he said,“and hardly any of us troubled to think what future we were making. And here itis!”“What have they got to, what has been done? How do I come into the midst of itall?” The vastness of street and house he was prepared for, the multitudes ofpeople. But conflicts in the city ways! And the systematised sensuality of aclass of rich men!He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic Utopia had so oddlyanticipated this actual experience. But here was no Utopia, no Socialisticstate. He had already seen enough to realise that the ancient antithesis ofluxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and abject poverty on the other,still prevailed. He knew enough of the essential factors of life to understandthat correlation. And not only were the buildings of the city gigantic and thecrowds in the street gigantic, but the voices he had heard in the ways, theuneasiness of Howard, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic discontent. Whatcountry was he in? Still England it seemed, and yet strangely “un-English.” Hismind glanced at the rest of the world, and saw only an enigmatical veil.He prowled about his apartment, examining everything as a caged animal might do.He felt very tired, felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of rest.He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to catch some distant echo ofthe tumults he felt must be proceeding in the city.He began to talk to himself. “Two hundred and three years!” he said to himselfover and over again, laughing stupidly. “Then I am two hundred and thirty-threeyears old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven’t reversed the tendency ofour time and gone back to the rule of the oldest. My claims are indisputable.Mumble, mumble. I remember the Bulgarian atrocities as though it was yesterday.’Tis a great age! Ha ha!” He was surprised at first to hear himself laughing,and then laughed again deliberately and louder. Then he realised that he wasbehaving foolishly. “Steady,” he said. “Steady!”His pacing became more regular. “This new world,” he said. “I don’t understandit. Why? . . . But it is all why! ”“I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things. Let me try and remember justhow it began.”He was surprised at first to find how vague the memories of his first thirtyyears had become. He remembered fragments, for the most part trivial moments,things of no great importance that he had observed. His boyhood seemed the mostaccessible at first, he recalled school books and certain lessons inmensuration. Then he revived the more salient features of his life, memories ofthe wife long since dead, her magic influence now gone beyond corruption, of hisrivals and friends and betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that,and then of his last years of misery, of fluctuating resolves, and at last ofhis strenuous studies. In a little while he perceived he had it all again; dimperhaps, like metal long laid aside, but in no way defective or injured, capableof re-polishing. And the hue of it was a deepening misery. Was it worthre-polishing? By a miracle he had been lifted out of a life that had becomeintolerable. . . .He reverted to his present condition. He wrestled with the facts in vain. Itbecame an inextricable tangle. He saw the sky through the ventilator pink withdawn. An old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his memory. “I mustsleep,” he said. It appeared as a delightful relief from this mental distressand from the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs. He went to the strangelittle bed, lay down and was presently asleep. . . .He was destined to become very familiar indeed with these apartments before heleft them, for he remained imprisoned for three days. During that time no one,except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel of his fate mingled with and insome way minimised the marvel of his survival. He had awakened to mankind itseemed only to be snatched away into this unaccountable solitude. Howard cameregularly with subtly sustaining and nutritive fluids, and light and pleasantfoods, quite strange to Graham. He always closed the door carefully as heentered. On matters of detail he was increasingly obliging, but the bearing ofGraham on the great issues that were evidently being contested so closely beyondthe soundproof walls that enclosed him, he would not elucidate. He evaded, aspolitely as possible, every question on the position of affairs in the outerworld.And in those three days Graham’s incessant thoughts went far and wide. All thathe had seen, all this elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing, workedtogether in his mind. Almost every possible interpretation of his position hedebated—even as it chanced, the right interpretation. Things that presentlyhappened to him, came to him at last credible, by virtue of this seclusion. Whenat length the moment of his release arrived, it found him prepared. . . .Howard’s bearing went far to deepen Graham’s impression of his own strangeimportance; the door between its opening and closing seemed to admit with him abreath of momentous happening. His enquiries became more definite and searching.Howard retreated through protests and difficulties. The awakening wasunforeseen, he repeated; it happened to have fallen in with the trend of asocial convulsion. “To explain it I must tell you the history of a gross and ahalf of years,” protested Howard.“The thing is this,” said Graham. “You are afraid of something I shall do. Insome way I am arbitrator—I might be arbitrator.”“It is not that. But you have—I may tell you this much—the automatic increase ofyour property puts great possibilities of interference in your hands. And incertain other ways you have influence, with your eighteenth century notions.”“Nineteenth century,” corrected Graham.“With your Old World notions, anyhow, ignorant as you are of every feature ofour State.”“Am I a fool?”“Certainly not.”“Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act rashly?”“You were never expected to act at all. No one counted on your awakening. No onedreamt you would ever awake. The Council had surrounded you with antisepticconditions. As a matter of fact, we thought that you were dead—a mere arrest ofdecay. And—but it is too complex. We dare not suddenly— while you are still halfawake.”“It won’t do,” said Graham. “Suppose it is as you say—why am I not being crammednight and day with facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to fit mefor my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now than two days ago, if it is twodays, when I awoke?”Howard pulled his lip.“I am beginning to feel—every hour I feel more clearly—a sense of complexconcealment of which you are the salient point. Is this Council, or committee,or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate? Is that it?”“That note of suspicion—” said Howard.“Ugh!” said Graham. “Now, mark my words, it will be ill for those who have putme here. It will be ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I am alive. Every daymy pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more vigorous. No more quiescence.I am a man come back to life. And I want to live—”“Live!”Howard’s face lit with an idea. He came towards Graham and spoke in an easyconfidential tone.“The Council secludes you here for your good. You are restless. Naturally—anenergetic man! You find it dull here. But we are anxious that everything you maydesire—every desire— every sort of desire. . . . There may be something. Isthere any sort of company?”He paused meaningly.“Yes,” said Graham thoughtfully. “There is.”“Ah! Now! We have treated you neglectfully.”“The crowds in yonder streets of yours.”“That,” said Howard, “I am afraid—. But—”Graham began pacing the room. Howard stood near the door watching him. Theimplication of Howard’s suggestion was only half evident to Graham. Company?Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some sort of company? Would therebe any possibilities of gathering from the conversation of this additionalperson some vague inkling of the struggle that had broken out so vividly at hiswaking moment? He meditated again, and the suggestion took colour. He turned onHoward abruptly.“What do you mean by company?”Howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. “Human beings,” he said, witha curious smile on his heavy face.“Our social ideas,” he said, “have a certain increased liberality, perhaps, incomparison with your times. If a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as this—byfeminine society, for instance. We think it no scandal. We have cleared ourminds of formulæ. There is in our city a class, a necessary class, no longerdespised— discreet—”Graham stopped dead.“It would pass the time,” said Howard. “It is a thing I should perhaps havethought of before, but, as a matter of fact, so much is happening—”He indicated the exterior world.Graham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a possible woman that hisimagination suddenly created dominated his mind with an intense attraction. Thenhe flashed into anger.“No!” he shouted.He began striding rapidly up and down the room. “Everything you say, everythingyou do, convinces me—of some great issue in which I am concerned. I do not wantto pass the time, as you call it. Yes, I know. Desire and indulgence are life ina sense—and Death! Extinction! In my life before I slept I had worked out thatpitiful question. I will not begin again. There is a city, a multitude—. Andmeanwhile I am here like a rabbit in a bag.”His rage surged high. He choked for a moment and began to wave his clenchedfists. He gave way to an anger fit, he swore archaic curses. His gestures hadthe quality of physical threats.“I do not know who your party may be. I am in the dark, and you keep me in thedark. But I know this, that I am secluded here for no good purpose. For no goodpurpose. I warn you, I warn you of the consequences. Once I come at my power—”He realised that to threaten thus might be a danger to himself. He stopped.Howard stood regarding him with a curious expression.“I take it this is a message to the Council,” said Howard.Graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the man, fell or stun him. It musthave shown upon his face; at any rate Howard’s movement was quick. In a secondthe noiseless door had closed again, and the man from the nineteenth century wasalone.For a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands half raised. Then he flung themdown. “What a fool I have been!” he said, and gave way to his anger again,stamping about the room and shouting curses. . . . For a long time he kepthimself in a sort of frenzy, raging at his position, at his own folly, at theknaves who had imprisoned him. He did this because he did not want to lookcalmly at his position. He clung to his anger—because he was afraid of Fear.Presently he found himself reasoning with himself. This imprisonment wasunaccountable, but no doubt the legal forms— new legal forms—of the timepermitted it. It must, of course, be legal. These people were two hundred yearsfurther on in the march of civilisation than the Victorian generation. It wasnot likely they would be less—humane. Yet they had cleared their minds offormulæ! Was humanity a formula as well as chastity?His imagination set to work to suggest things that might be done to him. Theattempts of his reason to dispose of these suggestions, though for the most partlogically valid, were quite unavailing. “Why should anything be done to me?”“If the worst comes to the worst,” he found himself saying at last, “I can giveup what they want. But what do they want? And why don’t they ask me for itinstead of cooping me up?”He returned to his former preoccupation with the Council’s possible intentions.He began to reconsider the details of Howard’s behaviour, sinister glances,inexplicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind circled about the idea ofescaping from these rooms; but whither could he escape into this vast, crowdedworld? He would be worse off than a Saxon yeoman suddenly dropped intonineteenth century London. And besides, how could anyone escape from theserooms?“How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen to me?”He thought of the tumult, the great social trouble of which he was sounaccountably the axis. A text, irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent,came floating up out of the darkness of his memory. This also a Council hadsaid:“It is expedient for us that one man should die for the people.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8THE ROOF SPACESAs the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room rotated and permittedglimpses of the night, dim sounds drifted in thereby. And Graham, standingunderneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown powers that imprisoned him, andwhich he had now deliberately challenged, was startled by the sound of a voice.He peered up and saw in the intervals of the rotation, dark and dim, the faceand shoulders of a man regarding him. Then a dark hand was extended, the swiftvan struck it, swung round and beat on with a little brownish patch on the edgeof its thin blade, and something began to fall therefrom upon the floor,dripping silently.Graham looked down, and there were spots of blood at his feet. He looked upagain in a strange excitement. The figure had gone.He remained motionless—his every sense intent upon the flickering patch ofdarkness, for outside it was high night. He became aware of some faint, remote,dark specks floating lightly through the outer air. They came down towards him,fitfully, eddyingly, and passed aside out of the uprush from the fan. A gleam oflight flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness came again.Warmed and lit as he was, he perceived that it was snowing within a few feet ofhim.Graham walked across the room and came back to the ventilator again. He saw thehead of a man pass near. There was a sound of whispering. Then a smart blow onsome metallic substance, effort, voices, and the vans stopped. A gust ofsnowflakes whirled into the room, and vanished before they touched the floor.“Don’t be afraid,” said a voice.Graham stood under the van. “Who are you?” he whispered.For a moment there was nothing but a swaying of the fan, and then the head of aman was thrust cautiously into the opening. His face appeared nearly inverted toGraham; his dark hair was wet with dissolving flakes of snow upon it. His armwent up into the darkness holding something unseen. He had a youthful face andbright eyes, and the veins of his forehead were swollen. He seemed to beexerting himself to maintain his position.For several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.“You were the Sleeper?” said the stranger at last.“Yes,” said Graham. “What do you want with me?”“I come from Ostrog, Sire.”“Ostrog?”The man in the ventilator twisted his head round so that his profile was towardsGraham. He appeared to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty exclamation, andthe intruder sprang back just in time to escape the sweep of the released fan.And when Graham peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly falling snow.It was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything returned to the ventilator.But at last came the same metallic interference again; the fans stopped and theface reappeared. Graham had remained all this time in the same place, alert andtremulously excited.“Who are you? What do you want?” he said.“We want to speak to you, Sire,” said the intruder. “We want—I can’t hold thething. We have been trying to find a way to you—these three days.”“Is it rescue?” whispered Graham. “Escape?”“Yes, Sire. If you will.”“You are my party—the party of the Sleeper?”“Yes, Sire.”“What am I to do?” said Graham.There was a struggle. The stranger’s arm appeared, and his hand was bleeding.His knees came into view over the edge of the funnel. “Stand away from me,” hesaid, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands and one shoulder at Graham’sfeet. The released ventilator whirled noisily. The stranger rolled over, sprangup nimbly and stood panting, hand to a bruised shoulder, and with his brighteyes on Graham.“You are indeed the Sleeper,” he said. “I saw you asleep. When it was the lawthat anyone might see you.”“I am the man who was in the trance,” said Graham. “They have imprisoned mehere. I have been here since I awoke—at least three days.”The intruder seemed about to speak, heard something, glanced swiftly at thedoor, and suddenly left Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick incoherentwords. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand, and he began tap, tap, aquick succession of blows upon the hinges. “Mind!” cried a voice. “Oh!” Thevoice came from above.Graham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked, was struck on the shoulderby one of them, and a heavy weight bore him to the earth. He fell on his kneesand forward, and the weight went over his head. He knelt up and saw a second manfrom above seated before him.“I did not see you, Sire,” panted the man. He rose and assisted Graham to arise.“Are you hurt, Sire?” he panted. A succession of heavy blows on the ventilatorbegan, something fell close to Graham’s face, and a shivering edge of whitemetal danced, fell over, and lay flat upon the floor.“What is this?” cried Graham, confused and looking at the ventilator. “Who areyou? What are you going to do? Remember, I understand nothing.”“Stand back,” said the stranger, and drew him from under the ventilator asanother fragment of metal fell heavily.“We want you to come, Sire,” panted the new comer, and Graham glancing at hisface again, saw a new cut had changed from white to red on his forehead, and acouple of little trickles of blood starting therefrom. “Your people call foryou.”“Come where? My people?”“To the hall about the markets. Your life is in danger here. We have spies. Welearned but just in time. The Council has decided—this very day—either to drugor kill you. And everything is ready. The people are drilled, the wind-vanepolice, the engineers, and half the way-gearers are with us. We have the hallscrowded—shouting. The whole city shouts against the Council. We have arms.” Hewiped the blood with his hand. “Your life here is not worth—”“But why arms?”“The people have risen to protect you, Sire. What?”He turned quickly as the man who had first come down made a hissing with histeeth. Graham saw the latter start back, gesticulate to them to concealthemselves, and move as if to hide behind the opening door.As he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one hand and his heavy facedowncast. He started, looked up, the door slammed behind him, the tray tiltedsideways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear. He went down like afelled tree, and lay as he fell athwart the floor of the outer room. The man whohad struck him bent hastily, studied his face for a moment, rose, and returnedto his work at the door.“Your poison!” said a voice in Graham’s ear.Then abruptly they were in darkness. The innumerable cornice lights had beenextinguished. Graham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snowwhirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three knelt on the van. Somedim thing—a ladder—was being lowered through the opening, and a hand appearedholding a fitful yellow light.He had a moment of hesitation. But the manner of these men, their swiftalacrity, their words, marched so completely with his own fears of the Council,with his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a moment. And his peopleawaited him!“I do not understand,” he said, “I trust. Tell me what to do.”The man with the cut brow gripped Graham’s arm. “Clamber up the ladder,” hewhispered. “Quick. They will have heard—”Graham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put his foot on the lower rung,and, turning his head, saw over the shoulder of the nearest man, in the yellowflicker of the light, the firstcomer astride over Howard and still working atthe door. Graham turned to the ladder again, and was thrust by his conductor andhelped up by those above, and then he was standing on something hard and coldand slippery outside the ventilating funnel.He shivered. He was aware of a great difference in the temperature. Half a dozenmen stood about him, and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and melted.For a moment it was dark, then for a flash a ghastly violet white, and theneverything was dark again.He saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast city structure which hadreplaced the miscellaneous houses, streets and open spaces of Victorian London.The place upon which he stood was level, with huge serpentine cables lyingathwart it in every direction. The circular wheels of a number of windmillsloomed indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snowfall, and roaredwith a varying loudness as the fitful wind rose and fell. Some way off anintermittent white light smote up from below, touched the snow eddies with atransient glitter, and made an evanescent spectre in the night; and here andthere, low down, some vaguely outlined wind-driven mechanism flickered withlivid sparks.All this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as his rescuers stood about him.Someone threw a thick soft cloak of fur-like texture about him, and fastened itby buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things were said briefly, decisively.Someone thrust him forward.Before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped his arm. “This way,” saidthis shape, urging him along, and pointed Graham across the flat roof in thedirection of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham obeyed.“Mind!” said a voice, as Graham stumbled against a cable. “Between them and notacross them,” said the voice. And, “We must hurry.”“Where are the people?” said Graham. “The people you said awaited me?”The stranger did not answer. He left Graham’s arm as the path grew narrower, andled the way with rapid strides. Graham followed blindly. In a minute he foundhimself running. “Are the others coming?” he panted, but received no reply. Hiscompanion glanced back and ran on. They came to a sort of pathway of openmetal-work, transverse to the direction they had come, and they turned aside tofollow this. Graham looked back, but the snowstorm had hidden the others.“Come on!” said his guide. Running now, they drew near a little windmillspinning high in the air. “Stoop,” said Graham’s guide, and they avoided anendless band running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. “This way!” and theywere ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted thawing snow, between two low wallsof metal that presently rose waist high. “I will go first,” said the guide.Graham drew his cloak about him and followed. Then suddenly came a narrow abyssacross which the gutter leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side. Grahampeeped over the side once and the gulf was black. For a moment he regretted hisflight. He dared not look again, and his brain spun as he waded through the halfliquid snow.Then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried across a wide flat space dampwith thawing snow, and for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that wentto and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable looking substance, but hisguide ran on unheeding, and so they came to and clambered up slippery steps tothe rim of a great dome of glass. Round this they went. Far below a number ofpeople seemed to be dancing, and music filtered through the dome. . . . Grahamfancied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm, and his guide hurried him onwith a new spurt of haste. They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills,one so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came rushing into sight andrushed up again and was lost in the night and the snow. They hurried for a timethrough the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and came at last above aplace of moving platforms like the place into which Graham had looked from thebalcony. They crawled across the sloping transparency that covered this streetof platforms, crawling on hands and knees because of the slipperiness of thesnowfall.For the most part the glass was bedewed, and Graham saw only hazy suggestions ofthe forms below, but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was clear,and he found himself looking sheerly down upon it all. For awhile, in spite ofthe urgency of his guide, he gave way to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on theglass, sick and paralysed. Far below, mere stirring specks and dots, went thepeople of the unsleeping city in their perpetual daylight, and the movingplatforms ran on their incessant journey. Messengers and men on unknownbusinesses shot along the drooping cables and the frail bridges were crowdedwith men. It was like peering into a gigantic glass hive, and it lay verticallybelow him with only a tough glass of unknown thickness to save him from a fall.The street showed warm and lit, and Graham was wet now to the skin with thawingsnow, and his feet were numbed with cold. For a space he could not move. “Comeon!” cried his guide, with terror in his voice. “Come on!”Graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.Over the ridge, following his guide’s example, he turned about and slid backwarddown the opposite slope very swiftly, amid a little avalanche of snow. While hewas sliding he thought of what would happen if some broken gap should come inhis way. At the edge he stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush, thankingheaven for an opaque footing again. His guide was already clambering up a metalscreen to a level expanse.Through the spare snowflakes above this loomed another line of vast windmills,and then suddenly the amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced with adeafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling of extraordinary intensity thatseemed to come simultaneously from every point of the compass.“They have missed us already!” cried Graham’s guide in an accent of terror, andsuddenly, with a blinding flash, the night became day.Above the driving snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, appeared vast mastscarrying globes of livid light. They receded in illimitable vistas in everydirection. As far as his eye could penetrate the snowfall they glared.“Get on this,” cried Graham’s conductor, and thrust him forward to a longgrating of snowless metal that ran like a band between two slightly slopingexpanses of snow. It felt warm to Graham’s benumbed feet, and a faint eddy ofsteam rose from it.“Come on!” shouted his guide ten yards off, and, without waiting, ran swiftlythrough the incandescent glare towards the iron supports of the next range ofwind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonishment, followed as fast,convinced of his imminent capture. . . .In a score of seconds they were within a tracery of glare and black shadows shotwith moving bars beneath the monstrous wheels. Graham’s conductor ran on forsome time, and suddenly darted sideways and vanished into a black shadow in thecorner of the foot of a huge support. In another moment Graham was beside him.They cowered panting and stared out.The scene upon which Graham looked was very wild and strange. The snow had nowalmost ceased; only a belated flake passed now and again across the picture. Butthe broad stretch of level before them was a ghastly white, broken only bygigantic masses and moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable darkness,vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All about them, huge metallic structures, irongirders, inhumanly vast as it seemed to him, interlaced, and the edges ofwind-wheels, scarcely moving in the lull, passed in great shining curves steeperand steeper up into a luminous haze. Wherever the snow-spangled light struckdown, beams and girders, and incessant bands running with a halting, indomitableresolution, passed upward and downward into the black. And with all that mightyactivity, with an omnipresent sense of motive and design, this snow-claddesolation of mechanism seemed void of all human presence save themselves,seemed as trackless and deserted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessibleAlpine snowfield.“They will be chasing us,” cried the leader. “We are scarcely halfway there yet.Cold as it is we must hide here for a space— at least until it snows morethickly again.”His teeth chattered in his head.“Where are the markets?” asked Graham staring out. “Where are all the people?”The other made no answer.“Look!” whispered Graham, crouched close, and became very still.The snow had suddenly become thick again, and sliding with the whirling eddiesout of the black pit of the sky came something, vague and large and very swift.It came down in a steep curve and swept round, wide wings extended and a trailof white condensing steam behind it, rose with an easy swiftness and wentgliding up the air, swept horizontally forward in a wide curve, and vanishedagain in the steaming specks of snow. And, through the ribs of its body, Grahamsaw two little men, very minute and active, searching the snowy areas about him,as it seemed to him, with field glasses. For a second they were clear, then hazythrough a thick whirl of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they weregone.“Now!” cried his companion. “Come!”He pulled Graham’s sleeve, and incontinently the two were running headlong downthe arcade of ironwork beneath the wind-wheels. Graham, running blindly,collided with his leader, who had turned back on him suddenly. He found himselfwithin a dozen yards of a black chasm. It extended as far as he could see rightand left. It seemed to cut off their progress in either direction.“Do as I do,” whispered his guide. He lay down and crawled to the edge, thrusthis head over and twisted until one leg hung. He seemed to feel for somethingwith his foot, found it, and went sliding over the edge into the gulf. His headreappeared. “It is a ledge,” he whispered. “In the dark all the way along. Do asI did.”Graham hesitated, went down upon all fours, crawled to the edge, and peered intoa velvety blackness. For a sickly moment he had courage neither to go on norretreat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt his guide’s hands pulling athim, had a horrible sensation of sliding over the edge into the unfathomable,splashed, and felt himself in a slushy gutter, impenetrably dark.“This way,” whispered the voice, and he began crawling along the gutter throughthe trickling thaw, pressing himself against the wall. They continued along itfor some minutes. He seemed to pass through a hundred stages of misery, to passminute after minute through a hundred degrees of cold, damp, and exhaustion. Ina little while he ceased to feel his hands and feet.The gutter sloped downwards. He observed that they were now many feet below theedge of the buildings. Rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts ofblind-drawn windows rose above them. They came to the end of a cable fastenedabove one of these white windows, dimly visible and dropping into impenetrableshadows. Suddenly his hand came against his guide’s. “Still!” whispered thelatter very softly.He looked up with a start and saw the huge wings of the flying machine glidingslowly and noiselessly overhead athwart the broad band of snow-flecked grey-bluesky. In a moment it was hidden again.“Keep still; they were just turning.”For awhile both were motionless, then Graham’s companion stood up, and reachingtowards the fastenings of the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle.“What is that?” asked Graham.The only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched motionless. Graham peered andsaw his face dimly. He was staring down the long ribbon of sky, and Graham,following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and faint and remote. Then hesaw that the wings spread on either side, that it headed towards them, thatevery moment it grew larger. It was following the edge of the chasm towardsthem.The man’s movements became convulsive. He thrust two cross bars into Graham’shand. Graham could not see them, he ascertained their form by feeling. They wereslung by thin cords to the cable. On the cord were hand grips of some softelastic substance. “Put the cross between your legs,” whispered the guidehysterically, “and grip the holdfasts. Grip tightly, grip!”Graham did as he was told.“Jump,” said the voice. “In heaven’s name, jump!”For one momentous second Graham could not speak. He was glad afterwards thatdarkness hid his face. He said nothing. He began to tremble violently. He lookedsideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky as it rushed upon him.“Jump! Jump—in God’s name! Or they will have us,” cried Graham’s guide, and inthe violence of his passion thrust him forward.Graham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a cry in spite of himself, andthen, as the flying machine swept over them, fell forward into the pit of thatdarkness, seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes with the clutch ofdeath. Something cracked, something rapped smartly against a wall. He heard thepulley of the cradle hum on its rope. He heard the aeronauts shout. He felt apair of knees digging into his back. . . . He was sweeping headlong through theair, falling through the air. All his strength was in his hands. He would havescreamed but he had no breath.He shot into a blinding light that made him grip the tighter. He recognised thegreat passage with the running ways, the hanging lights and interlacing girders.They rushed upward and by him. He had a momentary impression of a great circularaperture yawning to swallow him up.He was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping with aching hands, andbehold! a clap of sound, a burst of light, and he was in a brightly lit hallwith a roaring multitude of people beneath his feet. The people! His people! Aproscenium, a stage rushed up towards him, and his cable swept down to acircular aperture to the right of this. He felt he was travelling slower, andsuddenly very much slower. He distinguished shouts of “Saved! The Master. He issafe!” The stage rushed up towards him with rapidly diminishing swiftness.Then—.He heard the man clinging behind him shout as if suddenly terrified, and thisshout was echoed by a shout from below. He felt that he was no longer glidingalong the cable but falling with it. There was a tumult of yells, screams andcries. He felt something soft against his extended hand, and the impact of abroken fall quivering through his arm. . . .He wanted to be still and the people were lifting him. He believed afterwards hewas carried to the platform and given some drink, but he was never sure. He didnot notice what became of his guide. When his mind was clear again he was on hisfeet; eager hands were assisting him to stand. He was in a big alcove, occupyingthe position that in his previous experience had been devoted to the lowerboxes. If this was indeed a theatre.A mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar, the shouting of a countlessmultitude. “It is the Sleeper! The Sleeper is with us!”“The Sleeper is with us! The Master—the Owner! The Master is with us. He issafe.”Graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded with people. He saw noindividuals, he was conscious of a froth of pink faces, of waving arms andgarments, he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over him, buoyinghim up. There were balconies, galleries, great archways giving remoterperspectives, and everywhere people, a vast arena of people, densely packed andcheering. Across the nearer space lay the collapsed cable like a huge snake. Ithad been cut by the men of the flying machine at its upper end, and had crumpleddown into the hall. Men seemed to be hauling this out of the way. But the wholeeffect was vague, the very buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of thevoices.He stood unsteadily and looked at those about him. Someone supported him by onearm. “Let me go into a little room,” he said, weeping; “a little room,” andcould say no more. A man in black stepped forward, took his disengaged arm. Hewas aware of officious men opening a door before him. Someone guided him to aseat. He staggered. He sat down heavily and covered his face with his hands; hewas trembling violently, his nervous control was at an end. He was relieved ofhis cloak, he could not remember how; his purple hose he saw were black withwet. People were running about him, things were happening, but for some time hegave no heed to them.He had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that. He was safe. These were thepeople who were on his side. For a space he sobbed for breath, and then he satstill with his face covered. The air was full of the shouting of innumerablemen."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9THE PEOPLE MARCHHe became aware of someone urging a glass of clear fluid upon his attention,looked up and discovered this was a dark young man in a yellow garment. He tookthe dose forthwith, and in a moment he was glowing. A tall man in a black robestood by his shoulder, and pointed to the half open door into the hall. This manwas shouting close to his ear and yet what was said was indistinct because ofthe tremendous uproar from the great theatre. Behind the man was a girl in asilvery grey robe, whom Graham, even in this confusion, perceived to bebeautiful. Her dark eyes, full of wonder and curiosity, were fixed on him, herlips trembled apart. A partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded hall,and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering, clapping and shouting that diedaway and began again, and rose to a thunderous pitch, and so continuedintermittently all the time that Graham remained in the little room. He watchedthe lips of the man in black and gathered that he was making some clumsyexplanation.He stared stupidly for some moments at these things and then stood up abruptly;he grasped the arm of this shouting person.“Tell me!” he cried. “Who am I? Who am I?”The others came nearer to hear his words. “Who am I?” His eyes searched theirfaces.“They have told him nothing!” cried the girl.“Tell me, tell me!” cried Graham.“You are the Master of the Earth. You are owner of half the world.”He did not believe he heard aright. He resisted the persuasion. He pretended notto understand, not to hear. He lifted his voice again. “I have been awake threedays—a prisoner three days. I judge there is some struggle between a number ofpeople in this city—it is London?”“Yes,” said the younger man.“And those who meet in the great hall with the white Atlas? How does it concernme? In some way it has to do with me. Why, I don’t know. Drugs? It seems to methat while I have slept the world has gone mad. I have gone mad.”“Who are those Councillors under the Atlas? Why should they try to drug me?”“To keep you insensible,” said the man in yellow. “To prevent yourinterference.”“But why? ”“Because you are the Atlas, Sire,” said the man in yellow. “The world is on yourshoulders. They rule it in your name.”The sounds from the hall had died into a silence threaded by one monotonousvoice. Now suddenly, trampling on these last words, came a deafening tumult, aroaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer, voices hoarse and shrill,beating, overlapping, and while it lasted the people in the little room couldnot hear each other shout.Graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to the thing he had justheard. “The Council,” he repeated blankly, and then snatched at a name that hadstruck him. “But who is Ostrog?” he said.“He is the organiser—the organiser of the revolt. Our Leader—in your name.”“In my name?— And you? Why is he not here?”“He—has deputed us. I am his brother—his half-brother, Lincoln. He wants you toshow yourself to these people and then come on to him. That is why he has sent.He is at the wind-vane offices directing. The people are marching.”“In your name,” shouted the younger man. “They have ruled, crushed, tyrannised.At last even—”“In my name! My name! Master?”The younger man suddenly became audible in a pause of the outer thunder,indignant and vociferous, a high penetrating voice under his red aquiline noseand bushy moustache. “No one expected you to wake. No one expected you to wake.They were cunning. Damned tyrants! But they were taken by surprise. They did notknow whether to drug you, hypnotise you, kill you.”Again the hall dominated everything.“Ostrog is at the wind-vane offices ready—. Even now there is a rumour offighting beginning.”The man who had called himself Lincoln came close to him. “Ostrog has itplanned. Trust him. We have our organisations ready. We shall seize the flyingstages—. Even now he may be doing that. Then—”“This public theatre,” bawled the man in yellow, “is only a contingent. We havefive myriads of drilled men—”“We have arms,” cried Lincoln. “We have plans. A leader. Their police have gonefrom the streets and are massed in the—” (inaudible). “It is now or never. TheCouncil is rocking—. They cannot trust even their drilled men—”“Hear the people calling to you!”Graham’s mind was like a night of moon and swift clouds, now dark and hopeless,now clear and ghastly. He was Master of the Earth, he was a man sodden withthawing snow. Of all his fluctuating impressions the dominant ones presented anantagonism; on the one hand was the White Council, powerful, disciplined, few,the White Council from which he had just escaped; and on the other, monstrouscrowds, packed masses of indistinguishable people clamouring his name, hailinghim Master. The other side had imprisoned him, debated his death. These shoutingthousands beyond the little doorway had rescued him. But why these things shouldbe so he could not understand.The door opened, Lincoln’s voice was swept away and drowned, and a rush ofpeople followed on the heels of the tumult. These intruders came towards him andLincoln gesticulating. The voices without explained their soundless lips. “Showus the Sleeper, show us the Sleeper!” was the burden of the uproar. Men werebawling for “Order! Silence!”Graham glanced towards the open doorway, and saw a tall, oblong picture of thehall beyond, a waving, incessant confusion of crowded, shouting faces, men andwomen together, waving pale blue garments, extended hands. Many were standing,one man in rags of dark brown, a gaunt figure, stood on the seat and waved ablack cloth. He met the wonder and expectation of the girl’s eyes. What didthese people expect from him? He was dimly aware that the tumult outside hadchanged its character, was in some way beating, marching. His own mind, too,changed. For a space he did not recognise the influence that was transforminghim. But a moment that was near to panic passed. He tried to make audibleinquiries of what was required of him.Lincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was deafened to that. All the otherssave the woman gesticulated towards the hall. He perceived what had happened tothe uproar. The whole mass of people was chanting together. It was not simply asong, the voices were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of instrumentalmusic, music like the music of an organ, a woven texture of sounds, full oftrumpets, full of flaunting banners, full of the march and pageantry of openingwar. And the feet of the people were beating time—tramp, tramp.He was urged towards the door. He obeyed mechanically. The strength of thatchant took hold of him, stirred him, emboldened him. The hall opened to him, avast welter of fluttering colour swaying to the music.“Wave your arm to them,” said Lincoln. “Wave your arm to them.”“This,” said a voice on the other side, “he must have this.” Arms were about hisneck detaining him in the doorway, and a black subtly-folding mantle hung fromhis shoulders. He threw his arm free of this and followed Lincoln. He perceivedthe girl in grey close to him, her face lit, her gesture onward. For the instantshe became to him, flushed and eager as she was, an embodiment of the song. Heemerged in the alcove again. Incontinently the mounting waves of the song brokeupon his appearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting. Guided by Lincoln’shand he marched obliquely across the centre of the stage facing the people.The hall was a vast and intricate space—galleries, balconies, broad spaces ofamphitheatral steps, and great archways. Far away, high up, seemed the mouth ofa huge passage full of struggling humanity. The whole multitude was swaying incongested masses. Individual figures sprang out of the tumult, impressed himmomentarily, and lost definition again. Close to the platform swayed a beautifulfair woman, carried by three men, her hair across her face and brandishing agreen staff. Next this group an old careworn man in blue canvas maintained hisplace in the crush with difficulty, and behind shouted a hairless face, a greatcavity of toothless mouth. A voice called that enigmatical word “Ostrog.” Allhis impressions were vague save the massive emotion of that trampling song. Themultitude were beating time with their feet—marking time, tramp, tramp, tramp,tramp. The green weapons waved, flashed and slanted. Then he saw those nearestto him on a level space before the stage were marching in front of him, passingtowards a great archway, shouting “To the Council!” Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.He raised his arm, and the roaring was redoubled. He remembered he had to shout“March!” His mouth shaped inaudible heroic words. He waved his arm again andpointed to the archway, shouting “Onward!” They were no longer marking time,they were marching; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. In that host were bearded men,old men, youths, fluttering robed bare-armed women, girls. Men and women of thenew age! Rich robes, grey rags fluttered together in the whirl of their movementamidst the dominant blue. A monstrous black banner jerked its way to the right.He perceived a blue-clad negro, a shrivelled woman in yellow, then a group oftall fair-haired, white-faced, blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him. Henoted two Chinamen. A tall, sallow, dark-haired, shining-eyed youth, white-cladfrom top to toe, clambered up towards the platform shouting loyally, and sprangdown again and receded, looking backward. Heads, shoulders, hands clutchingweapons, all were swinging with those marching cadences.Faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood there, eyes met his andpassed and vanished. Men gesticulated to him, shouted inaudible personal things.Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly white. And disease wasthere, and many a hand that waved to him was gaunt and lean. Men and women ofthe new age! Strange and incredible meeting! As the broad stream passed beforehim to the right, tributary gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrustdownward in an incessant replacement of people; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. Theunison of the song was enriched and complicated by the massive echoes of archesand passages. Men and women mingled in the ranks; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.The whole world seemed marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his brain wastramping. The garments waved onward, the faces poured by more abundantly.Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln’s pressure he turned towards the archway,walking unconsciously in that rhythm, scarcely noticing his movement for themelody and stir of it. The multitude, the gesture and song, all moved in thatdirection, the flow of people smote downward until the upturned faces were belowthe level of his feet. He was aware of a path before him, of a suite about him,of guards and dignities, and Lincoln on his right hand. Attendants intervened,and ever and again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left. Beforehim went the backs of the guards in black—three and three and three. He wasmarched along a little railed way, and crossed above the archway, with thetorrent dipping to flow beneath, and shouting up to him. He did not know whitherhe went; he did not want to know. He glanced back across a flaming spaciousnessof hall. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10THE BATTLE OF THE DARKNESSHe was no longer in the hall. He was marching along a gallery overhanging one ofthe great streets of the moving platforms that traversed the city. Before himand behind him tramped his guards. The whole concave of the moving ways belowwas a congested mass of people marching, tramping to the left, shouting, wavinghands and arms, pouring along a huge vista, shouting as they came into view,shouting as they passed, shouting as they receded, until the globes of electriclight receding in perspective dropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bareheads. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.The song roared up to Graham now, no longer upborne by music, but coarse andnoisy, and the beating of the marching feet, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp,interwove with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the undisciplinedrabble that poured along the higher ways.Abruptly he noted a contrast. The buildings on the opposite side of the wayseemed deserted, the cables and bridges that laced across the aisle were emptyand shadowy. It came into Graham’s mind that these also should have swarmed withpeople.He felt a curious emotion—throbbing—very fast! He stopped again. The guardsbefore him marched on; those about him stopped as he did. He saw the directionof their faces. The throbbing had something to do with the lights. He too lookedup.At first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights simply, an isolatedphenomenon, having no bearing on the things below. Each huge globe of blindingwhiteness was as it were clutched, compressed in a systole that was followed bya transitory diastole, and again a systole like a tightening grip, darkness,light, darkness, in rapid alternation.Graham became aware that this strange behaviour of the lights had to do with thepeople below. The appearance of the houses and ways, the appearance of thepacked masses changed, became a confusion of vivid lights and leaping shadows.He saw a multitude of shadows had sprung into aggressive existence, seemedrushing up, broadening, widening, growing with steady swiftness—to leap suddenlyback and return reinforced. The song and the tramping had ceased. The unanimousmarch, he discovered, was arrested, there were eddies, a flow sideways, shoutsof “The lights!” Voices were crying together one thing. “The lights!” criedthese voices. “The lights!” He looked down. In this dancing death of the lightsthe area of the street had suddenly become a monstrous struggle. The huge whiteglobes became purple-white, purple with a reddish glow, flickered, flickeredfaster and faster, fluttered between light and extinction, ceased to flicker andbecame mere fading specks of glowing red in a vast obscurity. In ten seconds theextinction was accomplished, and there was only this roaring darkness, a blackmonstrosity that had suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of men.He felt invisible forms about him; his arms were gripped. Something rappedsharply against his shin. A voice bawled in his ear, “It is all right—allright.”Graham shook off the paralysis of his first astonishment. He struck his foreheadagainst Lincoln’s and bawled, “What is this darkness?”“The Council has cut the currents that light the city. We must wait—stop. Thepeople will go on. They will—”His voice was drowned. Voices were shouting, “Save the Sleeper. Take care of theSleeper.” A guard stumbled against Graham and hurt his hand by an inadvertentblow of his weapon. A wild tumult tossed and whirled about him, growing, as itseemed, louder, denser, more furious each moment. Fragments of recognisablesounds drove towards him were whirled away from him as his mind reached out tograsp them. Voices seemed to be shouting conflicting orders, other voicesanswered. There were suddenly a succession of piercing screams close beneaththem.A voice bawled in his ear, “The red police,” and receded forthwith beyond hisquestions.A crackling sound grew to distinctness, and therewith a leaping of faint flashesalong the edge of the further ways. By their light Graham saw the heads andbodies of a number of men, armed with weapons like those of his guards, leapinto an instant’s dim visibility. The whole area began to crackle, to flash withlittle instantaneous streaks of light, and abruptly the darkness rolled backlike a curtain.A glare of light dazzled his eyes, a vast seething expanse of struggling menconfused his mind. A shout, a burst of cheering, came across the ways. He lookedup to see the source of the light. A man hung far overhead from the upper partof a cable, holding by a rope the blinding star that had driven the darknessback. He wore a red uniform.Graham’s eyes fell to the ways again. A wedge of red a little way along thevista caught his eye. He saw it was a dense mass of red-clad men jammed on thehigher further way, their backs against the pitiless cliff of building, andsurrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists. They were fighting. Weapons flashedand rose and fell, heads vanished at the edge of the contest, and other headsreplaced them, the little flashes from the green weapons became little jets ofsmoky grey while the light lasted.Abruptly the flare was extinguished and the ways were an inky darkness oncemore, a tumultuous mystery.He felt something thrusting against him. He was being pushed along the gallery.Someone was shouting—it might be at him. He was too confused to hear. He wasthrust against the wall, and a number of people blundered past him. It seemed tohim that his guards were struggling with one another.Suddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again, and the whole scene waswhite and dazzling. The band of red-coats seemed broader and nearer; its apexwas half-way down the ways towards the central aisle. And raising his eyesGraham saw that a number of these men had also appeared now in the darkenedlower galleries of the opposite building, and were firing over the heads oftheir fellows below at the boiling confusion of people on the lower ways. Themeaning of these things dawned upon him. The march of the people had come uponan ambush at the very outset. Thrown into confusion by the extinction of thelights they were now being attacked by the red police. Then he became aware thathe was standing alone, that his guards and Lincoln were along the gallery in thedirection along which he had come before the darkness fell. He saw they weregesticulating to him wildly, running back towards him. A great shouting camefrom across the ways. Then it seemed as though the whole face of the darkenedbuilding opposite was lined and speckled with red-clad men. And they werepointing over to him and shouting. “The Sleeper! Save the Sleeper!” shouted amultitude of throats.Something struck the wall above his head. He looked up at the impact and saw astar-shaped splash of silvery metal. He saw Lincoln near him. Felt his armgripped. Then, pat, pat; he had been missed twice.For a moment he did not understand this. The street was hidden, everything washidden, as he looked. The second flare had burned out.Lincoln had gripped Graham by the arm, was lugging him along the gallery.“Before the next light!” he cried. His haste was contagious. Graham’s instinctof self-preservation overcame the paralysis of his incredulous astonishment. Hebecame for a time the blind creature of the fear of death. He ran, stumblingbecause of the uncertainty of the darkness, blundered into his guards as theyturned to run with him. Haste was his one desire, to escape this perilousgallery upon which he was exposed. A third glare came close on its predecessors.With it came a great shouting across the ways, an answering tumult from theways. The red-coats below, he saw, had now almost gained the central passage.Their countless faces turned towards him, and they shouted. The white façadeopposite was densely stippled with red. All these wonderful things concernedhim, turned upon him as a pivot. These were the guards of the Council attemptingto recapture him.Lucky it was for him that these shots were the first fired in anger for ahundred and fifty years. He heard bullets whacking over his head, felt a splashof molten metal sting his ear, and perceived without looking that the wholeopposite façade, an unmasked ambuscade of red police, was crowded and bawlingand firing at him.Down went one of his guards before him, and Graham, unable to stop, leapt thewrithing body.In another second he had plunged, unhurt, into a black passage, andincontinently someone, coming, it may be, in a transverse direction, blunderedviolently into him. He was hurling down a staircase in absolute darkness. Hereeled, and was struck again, and came against a wall with his hands. He wascrushed by a weight of struggling bodies, whirled round, and thrust to theright. A vast pressure pinned him. He could not breathe, his ribs seemedcracking. He felt a momentary relaxation, and then the whole mass of peoplemoving together, bore him back towards the great theatre from which he had sorecently come. There were moments when his feet did not touch the ground. Thenhe was staggering and shoving. He heard shouts of “They are coming!” and amuffled cry close to him. His foot blundered against something soft, he heard ahoarse scream under foot. He heard shouts of “The Sleeper!” but he was tooconfused to speak. He heard the green weapons crackling. For a space he lost hisindividual will, became an atom in a panic, blind, unthinking, mechanical. Hethrust and pressed back and writhed in the pressure, kicked presently against astep, and found himself ascending a slope. And abruptly the faces all about himleapt out of the black, visible, ghastly-white and astonished, terrified,perspiring, in a livid glare. One face, a young man’s, was very near to him, nottwenty inches away. At the time it was but a passing incident of no emotionalvalue, but afterwards it came back to him in his dreams. For this young man,wedged upright in the crowd for a time, had been shot and was already dead.A fourth white star must have been lit by the man on the cable. Its light cameglaring in through vast windows and arches and showed Graham that he was now oneof a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back across the lower area ofthe great theatre. This time the picture was livid and fragmentary, slashed andbarred with black shadows. He saw that quite near to him the red guards werefighting their way through the people. He could not tell whether they saw him.He looked for Lincoln and his guards. He saw Lincoln near the stage of thetheatre surrounded in a crowd of black-badged revolutionaries, lifted up andstaring to and fro as if seeking him. Graham perceived that he himself was nearthe opposite edge of the crowd, that behind him, separated by a barrier, slopedthe now vacant seats of the theatre. A sudden idea came to him, and he beganfighting his way towards the barrier. As he reached it the glare came to an end.In a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that not only impeded hismovements but made him conspicuous, and had slipped it from his shoulders. Heheard someone trip in its folds. In another he was scaling the barrier and haddropped into the blackness on the further side. Then feeling his way he came tothe lower end of an ascending gangway. In the darkness the sound of firingceased and the roar of feet and voices lulled. Then suddenly he came to anunexpected step and tripped and fell. As he did so pools and islands amidst thedarkness about him leapt to vivid light again, the uproar surged louder and theglare of the fifth white star shone through the vast fenestrations of thetheatre walls.He rolled over among some seats, heard a shouting and the whirring rattle ofweapons, struggled up and was knocked back again, perceived that a number ofblack-badged men were all about him firing at the reds below, leaping from seatto seat, crouching among the seats to reload. Instinctively he crouched amidstthe seats, as stray shots ripped the pneumatic cushions and cut bright slasheson their soft metal frames. Instinctively he marked the direction of thegangways, the most plausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil ofdarkness fell again.A young man in faded blue garments came vaulting over the seats. “Hullo!” hesaid, with his flying feet within six inches of the crouching Sleeper’s face.He stared without any sign of recognition, turned to fire, fired, and, shouting,“To hell with the Council!” was about to fire again. Then it seemed to Grahamthat the half of this man’s neck had vanished. A drop of moisture fell onGraham’s cheek. The green weapon stopped half raised. For a moment the man stoodstill with his face suddenly expressionless, then he began to slant forward. Hisknees bent. Man and darkness fell together. At the sound of his fall Graham roseup and ran for his life until a step down to the gangway tripped him. Hescrambled to his feet, turned up the gangway and ran on.When the sixth star glared he was already close to the yawning throat of apassage. He ran on the swifter for the light, entered the passage and turned acorner into absolute night again. He was knocked sideways, rolled over, andrecovered his feet. He found himself one of a crowd of invisible fugitivespressing in one direction. His one thought now was their thought also; to escapeout of this fighting. He thrust and struck, staggered, ran, was wedged tightly,lost ground and then was clear again.For some minutes he was running through the darkness along a winding passage,and then he crossed some wide and open space, passed down a long incline, andcame at last down a flight of steps to a level place. Many people were shouting,“They are coming! The guards are coming. They are firing. Get out of thefighting. The guards are firing. It will be safe in Seventh Way. Along here toSeventh Way!” There were women and children in the crowd as well as men. Mencalled names to him. The crowd converged on an archway, passed through a shortthroat and emerged on a wider space again, lit dimly. The black figures abouthim spread out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a gigantic series ofsteps. He followed. The people dispersed to the right and left. . . . Heperceived that he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the highest step.Before him, on that level, were groups of seats and a little kiosk. He went upto this and, stopping in the shadow of its eaves, looked about him panting.Everything was vague and gray, but he recognised that these great steps were aseries of platforms of the “ways,” now motionless again. The platform slanted upon either side, and the tall buildings rose beyond, vast dim ghosts, theirinscriptions and advertisements indistinctly seen, and up through the girdersand cables was a faint interrupted ribbon of pallid sky. A number of peoplehurried by. From their shouts and voices, it seemed they were hurrying to jointhe fighting. Other less noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows.From very far away down the street he could hear the sound of a struggle. But itwas evident to him that this was not the street into which the theatre opened.That former fight, it seemed, had suddenly dropped out of sound and hearing.And— grotesque thought!—they were fighting for him!For a space he was like a man who pauses in the reading of a vivid book, andsuddenly doubts what he has been taking un-questioningly. At that time he hadlittle mind for details; the whole effect was a huge astonishment. Oddly enough,while the flight from the Council prison, the great crowd in the hall, and theattack of the red police upon the swarming people were clearly present in hismind, it cost him an effort to piece in his awakening and to revive themeditative interval of the Silent Rooms. At first his memory leapt these thingsand took him back to the cascade at Pentargen quivering in the wind, and all thesombre splendours of the sunlit Cornish coast. The contrast touched everythingwith unreality. And then the gap filled, and he began to comprehend hisposition.It was no longer absolutely a riddle, as it had been in the Silent Rooms. Atleast he had the strange, bare outline now. He was in some way the owner of halfthe world, and great political parties were fighting to possess him. On the onehand was the White Council, with its red police, set resolutely, it seemed, onthe usurpation of his property and perhaps his murder; on the other, therevolution that had liberated him, with this unseen “Ostrog” as its leader. Andthe whole of this gigantic city was convulsed by their struggle. Franticdevelopment of his world! “I do not understand,” he cried. “I do notunderstand!”He had slipped out between the contending parties into this liberty of thetwilight. What would happen next? What was happening? He figured the red-cladmen as busily hunting him, driving the black-badged revolutionists before them.At any rate chance had given him a breathing space. He could lurk unchallengedby the passers-by, and watch the course of things. His eye followed up theintricate dim immensity of the twilight buildings, and it came to him as a thinginfinitely wonderful, that above there the sun was rising, and the world was litand glowing with the old familiar light of day. In a little while he hadrecovered his breath. His clothing had already dried upon him from the snow.He wandered for miles along these twilight ways, speaking to no one, accosted byno one—a dark figure among dark figures— the coveted man out of the past, theinestimable unintentional owner of half the world. Wherever there were lights ordense crowds, or exceptional excitement he was afraid of recognition, andwatched and turned back or went up and down by the middle stairways, into sometransverse system of ways at a lower or higher level. And though he came on nomore fighting, the whole city stirred with battle. Once he had to run to avoid amarching multitude of men that swept the street. Everyone abroad seemedinvolved. For the most part they were men, and they carried what he judged wereweapons. It seemed as though the struggle was concentrated mainly in the quarterof the city from which he came. Ever and again a distant roaring, the remotesuggestion of that conflict, reached his ears. Then his caution and hiscuriosity struggled together. But his caution prevailed, and he continuedwandering away from the fighting—so far as he could judge. He went unmolested,unsuspected through the dark. After a time he ceased to hear even a remote echoof the battle, fewer and fewer people passed him, until at last the Titanicstreets became deserted. The frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh; heseemed to have come to a district of vacant warehouses. Solitude crept uponhim—his pace slackened.He became aware of a growing fatigue. At times he would turn aside and seathimself on one of the numerous seats of the upper ways. But a feverishrestlessness, the knowledge of his vital implication in this struggle, would notlet him rest in any place for long. Was the struggle on his behalf alone?And then in a desolate place came the shock of an earthquake— a roaring andthundering—a mighty wind of cold air pouring through the city, the smash ofglass, the slip and thud of falling masonry—a series of gigantic concussions. Amass of glass and ironwork fell from the remote roofs into the middle gallery,not a hundred yards away from him, and in the distance were shouts and running.He, too, was startled to an aimless activity, and ran first one way and then asaimlessly back.A man came running towards him. His self-control returned. “What have they blownup?” asked the man breathlessly. “That was an explosion,” and before Grahamcould speak he had hurried on.The great buildings rose dimly, veiled by a perplexing twilight, albeit therivulet of sky above was now bright with day. He noted many strange features,understanding none at the time; he even spelt out many of the inscriptions inPhonetic lettering. But what profits it to decipher a confusion of odd-lookingletters resolving itself, after painful strain of eye and mind, into “Here isEadhamite,” or, “Labour Bureau—Little Side?” Grotesque thought, that in allprobability some or all of these cliff-like houses were his!The perversity of his experience came to him vividly. In actual fact he had madesuch a leap in time as romancers have imagined again and again. And that factrealised, he had been prepared, his mind had, as it were, seated itself for aspectacle. And no spectacle, but a great vague danger, unsympathetic shadows andveils of darkness. Somewhere through the labyrinthine obscurity his death soughthim. Would he, after all, be killed before he saw? It might be that even at thenext shadowy corner his destruction ambushed. A great desire to see, a greatlonging to know, arose in him.He became fearful of corners. It seemed to him that there was safety inconcealment. Where could he hide to be inconspicuous when the lights returned?At last he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the higher ways,conceiving he was alone there.He squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes. Suppose when he looked again hefound the dark trough of parallel ways and that intolerable altitude of edifice,gone? Suppose he were to discover the whole story of these last few days, theawakening, the shouting multitudes, the darkness and the fighting, aphantasmagoria, a new and more vivid sort of dream. It must be a dream; it wasso inconsecutive, so reasonless. Why were the people fighting for him? Whyshould this saner world regard him as Owner and Master?So he thought, sitting blinded, and then he looked again, half hoping in spiteof his ears to see some familiar aspect of the life of the nineteenth century,to see, perhaps, the little harbour of Boscastle about him, the cliffs ofPentargen, or the bedroom of his home. But fact takes no heed of human hopes. Asquad of men with a black banner tramped athwart the nearer shadows, intent onconflict, and beyond rose that giddy wall of frontage, vast and dark, with thedim incomprehensible lettering showing faintly on its face.“It is no dream,” he said, “no dream.” And he bowed his face upon his hands."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11THE OLD MAN WHO KNEW EVERYTHINGHe was startled by a cough close at hand.He turned sharply, and peering, saw a small, hunched-up figure sitting a coupleof yards off in the shadow of the enclosure.“Have ye any news?” asked the high-pitched wheezy voice of a very old man.Graham hesitated. “None,” he said.“I stay here till the lights come again,” said the old man. “These bluescoundrels are everywhere—everywhere.”Graham’s answer was inarticulate assent. He tried to see the old man but thedarkness hid his face. He wanted very much to respond, to talk, but he did notknow how to begin.“Dark and damnable,” said the old man suddenly. “Dark and damnable. Turned outof my room among all these dangers.”“That’s hard,” ventured Graham. “That’s hard on you.”“Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And all the world gone mad. War andfighting. The police beaten and rogues abroad. Why don’t they bring some negroesto protect us? . . . No more dark passages for me. I fell over a dead man.”“You’re safer with company,” said the old man, “if it’s company of the rightsort,” and peered frankly. He rose suddenly and came towards Graham.Apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory. The old man sat down as if relieved tobe no longer alone. “Eh!” he said, “but this is a terrible time! War andfighting, and the dead lying there— men, strong men, dying in the dark. Sons! Ihave three sons. God knows where they are tonight.”The voice ceased. Then repeated quavering: “God knows where they are tonight.”Graham stood revolving a question that should not betray his ignorance. Againthe old man’s voice ended the pause.“This Ostrog will win,” he said. “He will win. And what the world will be likeunder him no one can tell. My sons are under the wind-vanes, all three. One ofmy daughters-in-law was his mistress for a while. His mistress! We’re not commonpeople. Though they’ve sent me to wander tonight and take my chance. . . . Iknew what was going on. Before most people. But this darkness! And to fall overa dead body suddenly in the dark!”His wheezy breathing could be heard.“Ostrog!” said Graham.“The greatest Boss the world has ever seen,” said the voice.Graham ransacked his mind. “The Council has few friends among the people,” hehazarded.“Few friends. And poor ones at that. They’ve had their time. Eh! They shouldhave kept to the clever ones. But twice they held election. And Ostrog—. And nowit has burst out and nothing can stay it, nothing can stay it. Twice theyrejected Ostrog— Ostrog the Boss. I heard of his rages at the time—he wasterrible. Heaven save them! For nothing on earth can now, he has raised theLabour Companies upon them. No one else would have dared. All the blue canvasarmed and marching! He will go through with it. He will go through.”He was silent for a little while. “This Sleeper,” he said, and stopped.“Yes,” said Graham. “Well?”The senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the dim, pale face came close.“The real Sleeper—”“Yes,” said Graham.“Died years ago.”“What?” said Graham, sharply.“Years ago. Died. Years ago.”“You don’t say so!” said Graham.“I do. I do say so. He died. This Sleeper who’s woke up—they changed in thenight. A poor, drugged insensible creature. But I mustn’t tell all I know. Imustn’t tell all I know.”For a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret was too much for him. “Idon’t know the ones that put him to sleep— that was before my time—but I knowthe man who injected the stimulants and woke him again. It was ten to one—wakeor kill. Wake or kill. Ostrog’s way.”Graham was so astonished at these things that he had to interrupt, to make theold man repeat his words, to re-question vaguely, before he was sure of themeaning and folly of what he heard. And his awakening had not been natural! Wasthat an old man’s senile superstition, too, or had it any truth in it? Feelingin the dark corners of his memory, he presently came on something that mightconceivably be an impression of some such stimulating effect. It dawned upon himthat he had happened upon a lucky encounter, that at last he might learnsomething of the new age. The old man wheezed a while and spat, and then thepiping, reminiscent voice resumed:“The first time they rejected him. I’ve followed it all.”“Rejected whom?” said Graham. “The Sleeper?”“Sleeper? No. Ostrog. He was terrible—terrible! And he was promised then,promised certainly the next time. Fools they were—not to be more afraid of him.Now all the city’s his millstone, and such as we dust ground upon it. Dustground upon it. Until he set to work—the workers cut each other’s throats, andmurdered a Chinaman or a Labour policeman at times, and left the rest of us inpeace. Dead bodies! Robbing! Darkness! Such a thing hasn’t been this gross ofyears. Eh!—but ’tis ill on small folks when the great fall out! It’s ill.”“Did you say—there had not been—what?—for a gross of years?”“Eh?” said the old man.The old man said something about clipping his words, and made him repeat this athird time. “Fighting and slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools bawlingfreedom and the like,” said the old man. “Not in all my life has there beenthat. These are like the old days—for sure—when the Paris people broke out—three gross of years ago. That’s what I mean hasn’t been. But it’s the world’sway. It had to come back. I know. I know. This five years Ostrog has beenworking, and there has been trouble and trouble, and hunger and threats and hightalk and arms. Blue canvas and murmurs. No one safe. Everything sliding andslipping. And now here we are! Revolt and fighting, and the Council come to itsend.”“You are rather well-informed on these things,” said Graham.“I know what I hear. It isn’t all Babble Machine with me.”“No,” said Graham, wondering what Babble Machine might be. “And you are certainthis Ostrog—you are certain Ostrog organised this rebellion and arranged for thewaking of the Sleeper? Just to assert himself—because he was not elected to theCouncil?”“Everyone knows that, I should think,” said the old man.“Except—just fools. He meant to be master somehow. In the Council or not.Everyone who knows anything knows that. And here we are with dead bodies lyingin the dark! Why, where have you been if you haven’t heard all about the troublebetween Ostrog and the Verneys? And what do you think the troubles are about?The Sleeper? Eh? You think the Sleeper’s real and woke of his own accord—eh?”“I’m a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful,” said Graham. “Lots of thingsthat have happened—especially of late years—. If I was the Sleeper, to tell youthe truth, I couldn’t know less about them.”“Eh!” said the voice. “Old, are you? You don’t sound so very old! But it’s noteveryone keeps his memory to my time of life— truly. But these notorious things!But you’re not so old as me— not nearly so old as me. Well! I ought not to judgeother men by myself, perhaps. I’m young—for so old a man. Maybe you’re old forso young.”“That’s it,” said Graham. “And I’ve a queer history. I know very little. Andhistory! Practically I know no history. The Sleeper and Julius Caesar are allthe same to me. It’s interesting to hear you talk of these things.”“I know a few things,” said the old man. “I know a thing or two. But—. Hark!”The two men became silent, listening. There was a heavy thud, a concussion thatmade their seat shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted to one another. The oldman was full of questions; he shouted to a man who passed near. Graham,emboldened by his example, got up and accosted others. None knew what hadhappened.He returned to the seat and found the old man muttering vague interrogations inan undertone. For a while they said nothing to one another.The sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet so remote oppressedGraham’s imagination. Was this old man right, was the report of the peopleright, and were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they all in error, and werethe red guards driving all before them? At any time the flood of warfare mightpour into this silent quarter of the city and seize upon him again. It behovedhim to learn all he could while there was time. He turned suddenly to the oldman with a question and left it unsaid. But his motion moved the old man tospeech again.“Eh! but how things work together!” said the old man. “This Sleeper that all thefools put their trust in! I’ve the whole history of it—I was always a good onefor histories. When I was a boy— I’m that old—I used to read printed books.You’d hardly think it. Likely you’ve seen none—they rot and dust so—and theSanitary Company burns them to make ashlarite. But they were convenient in theirdirty way. One learnt a lot. These new-fangled Babble Machines—they don’t seemnew-fangled to you, eh?— they’re easy to hear, easy to forget. But I’ve tracedall the Sleeper business from the first.”“You will scarcely believe it,” said Graham slowly, “I’m so ignorant—I’ve beenso preoccupied in my own little affairs, my circumstances have been so odd—Iknow nothing of this Sleeper’s history. Who was he?”“Eh!” said the old man. “I know. I know. He was a poor nobody, and set on aplayful woman, poor soul! And he fell into a trance. There’s the old things theyhad, those brown things— silver photographs—still showing him as he lay, a grossand a half years ago—a gross and a half of years.”“Set on a playful woman, poor soul,” said Graham softly to himself, and thenaloud, “Yes—well! go on.”“You must know he had a cousin named Warming, a solitary man without children,who made a big fortune speculating in roads—the first Eadhamite roads. Butsurely you’ve heard? No? Why? He bought all the patent rights and made a bigcompany. In those days there were grosses of grosses of separate businesses andbusiness companies. Grosses of grosses! His roads killed the railroads—the oldthings—in two dozen years; he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And becausehe didn’t want to break up his great property or let in shareholders, he left itall to the Sleeper, and put it under a Board of Trustees that he had picked andtrained. He knew then the Sleeper wouldn’t wake, that he would go on sleeping,sleeping till he died. He knew that quite well! And plump! A man in the UnitedStates, who had lost two sons in a boat accident, followed that up with anothergreat bequest. His trustees found themselves with a dozen myriads oflions’-worth or more of property at the very beginning.”“What was his name?”“Graham.”“No—I mean—that American’s.”“Isbister.”“Isbister!” cried Graham. “Why, I don’t even know the name.”“Of course not,” said the old man. “Of course not. People don’t learn much inthe schools nowadays. But I know all about him. He was a rich American who wentfrom England, and he left the Sleeper even more than Warming. How he made it?That I don’t know. Something about pictures by machinery. But he made it andleft it, and so the Council had its start. It was just a council of trustees atfirst.”“And how did it grow?”“Eh!—but you’re not up to things. Money attracts money— and twelve brains arebetter than one. They played it cleverly. They worked politics with money, andkept on adding to the money by working currency and tariffs. They grew—theygrew. And for years the twelve trustees hid the growing of the Sleeper’s estate,under double names and company titles and all that. The Council spread by titledeed, mortgage, share, every political party, every newspaper, they bought. Ifyou listen to the old stories you will see the Council growing and growing.Billions and billions of lions at last—the Sleeper’s estate. And all growing outof a whim—out of this Warming’s will, and an accident to Isbister’s sons.“Men are strange,” said the old man. “The strange thing to me is how the Councilworked together so long. As many as twelve. But they worked in cliques from thefirst. And they’ve slipped back. In my young days speaking of the Council waslike an ignorant man speaking of God. We didn’t think they could do wrong. Wedidn’t know of their women and all that! Or else I’ve got wiser.“Men are strange,” said the old man. “Here are you, young and ignorant, andme—sevendy years old, and I might reasonably be forgetting—explaining it all toyou short and clear.“Sevendy,” he said, “sevendy, and I hear and see—hear better than I see. Andreason clearly, and keep myself up to all the happenings of things. Sevendy!“Life is strange. I was twaindy before Ostrog was a baby. I remember him longbefore he’d pushed his way to the head of the Wind Vanes Control. I’ve seen manychanges. Eh! I’ve worn the blue. And at last I’ve come to see this crush anddarkness and tumult and dead men carried by in heaps on the ways. And all hisdoing! All his doing!”His voice died away in scarcely articulate praises of Ostrog.Graham thought. “Let me see,” he said, “if I have it right.”He extended a hand and ticked off points upon his fingers. “The Sleeper has beenasleep—”“Changed,” said the old man.“Perhaps. And meanwhile the Sleeper’s property grew in the hands of TwelveTrustees, until it swallowed up nearly all the great ownership of the world. TheTwelve Trustees—by virtue of this property have become virtually masters of theworld. Because they are the paying power—just as the old English Parliament usedto be—”“Eh!” said the old man. “That’s so—that’s a good comparison. You’re not so—”“And now this Ostrog—has suddenly revolutionised the world by waking theSleeper—whom no one but the superstitious, common people had ever dreamt wouldwake again—raising the Sleeper to claim his property from the Council, after allthese years.”The old man endorsed this statement with a cough. “It’s strange,” he said, “tomeet a man who learns these things for the first time tonight.”“Aye,” said Graham, “it’s strange.”“Have you been in a Pleasure City?” said the old man. “All my life I’ve longed—”He laughed. “Even now,” he said, “I could enjoy a little fun. Enjoy seeingthings, anyhow.” He mumbled a sentence Graham did not understand.“The Sleeper—when did he awake?” said Graham suddenly.“Three days ago.”“Where is he?”“Ostrog has him. He escaped from the Council not four hours ago. My dear sir,where were you at the time? He was in the hall of the markets—where the fightinghas been. All the city was screaming about it. All the Babble Machines.Everywhere it was shouted. Even the fools who speak for the Council wereadmitting it. Everyone was rushing off to see him—everyone was getting arms.Were you drunk or asleep? And even then! But you’re joking! Surely you’repretending. It was to stop the shouting of the Babble Machines and prevent thepeople gathering that they turned off the electricity—and put this damneddarkness upon us. Do you mean to say—?”“I had heard the Sleeper was rescued,” said Graham. “But— to come back a minute.Are you sure Ostrog has him?”“He won’t let him go,” said the old man.“And the Sleeper. Are you sure he is not genuine? I have never heard—”“So all the fools think. So they think. As if there wasn’t a thousand thingsthat were never heard. I know Ostrog too well for that. Did I tell you? In a wayI’m a sort of relation of Ostrog’s. A sort of relation. Through mydaughter-in-law.”“I suppose—”“Well?”“I suppose there’s no chance of this Sleeper asserting himself. I suppose he’scertain to be a puppet—in Ostrog’s hands or the Council’s, as soon as thestruggle is over.”“In Ostrog’s hands—certainly. Why shouldn’t he be a puppet? Look at hisposition. Everything done for him, every pleasure possible. Why should he wantto assert himself ?”“What are these Pleasure Cities?” said Graham, abruptly.The old man made him repeat the question. When at last he was assured ofGraham’s words, he nudged him violently. “That’s too much,” said he. “You’repoking fun at an old man. I’ve been suspecting you know more than you pretend.”“Perhaps I do,” said Graham. “But no! why should I go on acting? No, I do notknow what a Pleasure City is.”The old man laughed in an intimate way.“What is more, I do not know how to read your letters, I do not know what moneyyou use, I do not know what foreign countries there are. I do not know where Iam. I cannot count. I do not know where to get food, nor drink, nor shelter.”“Come, come,” said the old man, “if you had a glass of drink, now, would you putit in your ear or your eye?”“I want you to tell me all these things.”“He, he! Well, gentlemen who dress in silk must have their fun.” A withered handcaressed Graham’s arm for a moment. “Silk. Well, well! But, all the same, I wishI was the man who was put up as the Sleeper. He’ll have a fine time of it. Allthe pomp and pleasure. He’s a queer looking face. When they used to let anyonego to see him, I’ve got tickets and been. The image of the real one, as thephotographs show him, this substitute used to be. Yellow. But he’ll get fed up.It’s a queer world. Think of the luck of it. The luck of it. I expect he’ll besent to Capri. It’s the best fun for a greener.”His cough overtook him again. Then he began mumbling enviously of pleasures andstrange delights. “The luck of it, the luck of it! All my life I’ve been inLondon, hoping to get my chance.”“But you don’t know that the Sleeper died,” said Graham, suddenly.The old man made him repeat his words.“Men don’t live beyond ten dozen. It’s not in the order of things,” said the oldman. “I’m not a fool. Fools may believe it, but not me.”Graham became angry with the old man’s assurance. “Whether you are a fool ornot,” he said, “it happens you are wrong about the Sleeper.”“Eh?”“You are wrong about the Sleeper. I haven’t told you before, but I will tell younow. You are wrong about the Sleeper.”“How do you know? I thought you didn’t know anything— not even about PleasureCities.”Graham paused.“You don’t know,” said the old man. “How are you to know? It’s very few men—”“I am the Sleeper.”He had to repeat it.There was a brief pause. “There’s a silly thing to say, sir, if you’ll excuseme. It might get you into trouble in a time like this,” said the old man.Graham, slightly dashed, repeated his assertion.“I was saying I was the Sleeper. That years and years ago I did, indeed, fallasleep, in a little stone-built village, in the days when there were hedgerows,and villages, and inns, and all the countryside cut up into little pieces,little fields. Have you never heard of those days? And it is I—I who speak toyou—who awakened again these four days since.”“Four days since!—the Sleeper! But they’ve got the Sleeper. They have him andthey won’t let him go. Nonsense! You’ve been talking sensibly enough up to now.I can see it as though I was there. There will be Lincoln like a keeper justbehind him; they won’t let him go about alone. Trust them. You’re a queerfellow. One of these fun pokers. I see now why you have been clipping your wordsso oddly, but—”He stopped abruptly, and Graham could see his gesture.“As if Ostrog would let the Sleeper run about alone! No, you’re telling that tothe wrong man altogether. Eh! as if I should believe. What’s your game? Andbesides, we’ve been talking of the Sleeper.”Graham stood up. “Listen,” he said. “I am the Sleeper.”“You’re an odd man,” said the old man, “to sit here in the dark, talkingclipped, and telling a lie of that sort. But—”Graham’s exasperation fell to laughter. “It is preposterous,” he cried.“Preposterous. The dream must end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am I—in thisdamned twilight—I never knew a dream in twilight before—an anachronism by twohundred years and trying to persuade an old fool that I am myself, andmeanwhile— Ugh!”He moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In a moment the old man waspursuing him. “Eh! but don’t go!” cried the old man. “I’m an old fool, I know.Don’t go. Don’t leave me in all this darkness.”Graham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of telling his secret flashed intohis mind.“I didn’t mean to offend you—disbelieving you,” said the old man coming near.“It’s no manner of harm. Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases you. ’Tis afoolish trick—”Graham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his way.For a time he heard the old man’s hobbling pursuit and his wheezy criesreceding. But at last the darkness swallowed him, and Graham saw him no more."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12OSTROGGraham could now take a clearer view of his position. For a long time yet hewandered, but after the talk of the old man his discovery of this Ostrog wasclear in his mind as the final inevitable decision. One thing was evident, thosewho were at the headquarters of the revolt had succeeded very admirably insuppressing the fact of his disappearance. But every moment he expected to hearthe report of his death or of his recapture by the Council.Presently a man stopped before him. “Have you heard?” he said.“No!” said Graham starting.“Near a dozand,” said the man, “a dozand men!” and hurried on.A number of men and a girl passed in the darkness, gesticulating and shouting:“Capitulated! Given up!” “A dozand of men.” “Two dozand of men.” “Ostrog,Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!” These cries receded, became indistinct.Other shouting men followed. For a time his attention was absorbed in thefragments of speech he heard. He had a doubt whether all were speaking English.Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English, like “nigger” dialect,blurred and mangled distortions. He dared accost no one with questions. Theimpression the people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions of thestruggle and confirmed the old man’s faith in Ostrog. It was only slowly hecould bring himself to believe that all these people were rejoicing at thedefeat of the Council, that the Council which had pursued him with such powerand vigour was after all the weaker of the two sides in conflict. And if thatwas so, how did it affect him? Several times he hesitated on the verge offundamental questions. Once he turned and walked for a long way after a littleman of rotund inviting outline, but he was unable to master confidence toaddress him.It was only slowly that it came to him that he might ask for the “wind-vaneoffices,” whatever the “wind-vane offices” might be. His first enquiry simplyresulted in a direction to go on towards Westminster. His second led to thediscovery of a short cut in which he was speedily lost. He was told to leave theways to which he had hitherto confined himself—knowing no other means oftransit—and to plunge down one of the middle staircases into the blackness of acrossway. Thereupon came some trivial adventures; chief of these an ambiguousencounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking in a strange dialectthat seemed at first a strange tongue, a thick flow of speech with the driftingcorpses of English words therein, the dialect of the latter-day vile. Thenanother voice drew near, a girl’s voice singing, “tralala tralala.” She spoke toGraham, her English touched with something of the same quality. She professed tohave lost her sister, she blundered needlessly into him he thought, caught holdof him and laughed. But a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the unseenagain.The sounds about him increased. Stumbling people passed him, speaking excitedly.“They have surrendered!” “The Council! Surely not the Council!” “They are sayingso in the ways.” The passage seemed wider. Suddenly the wall fell away. He wasin a great space and people were stirring remotely. He inquired his way of anindistinct figure. “Strike straight across,” said a woman’s voice. He left hisguiding wall, and in a moment had stumbled against a little table on which wereutensils of glass. Graham’s eyes, now attuned to darkness, made out a long vistawith pallid tables on either side. He went down this. At one or two of thetables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eating. There were people thencool enough to dine, or daring enough to steal a meal in spite of socialconvulsion and darkness. Far off and high up he presently saw a pallid light ofa semi-circular shape. As he approached this, a black edge came up and hid it.He stumbled at steps and found himself in a gallery. He heard a sobbing, andfound two scared little girls crouched by a railing. These children becamesilent at the near sound of feet. He tried to console them, but they were verystill until he left them. Then as he receded he could hear them sobbing again.Presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase and near a wide opening.He saw a dim twilight above this and ascended out of the blackness into a streetof moving ways again. Along this a disorderly swarm of people marched shouting.They were singing snatches of the song of the revolt, most of them out of tune.Here and there torches flared creating brief hysterical shadows. He asked hisway and was twice puzzled by that same thick dialect. His third attempt won ananswer he could understand. He was two miles from the wind-vane offices inWestminster, but the way was easy to follow.When at last he did approach the district of the wind-vane offices it seemed tohim, from the cheering processions that came marching along the ways, from thetumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration of the lighting of thecity, that the overthrow of the Council must already be accomplished. And stillno news of his absence came to his ears.The re-illumination of the city came with startling abruptness. Suddenly hestood blinking, all about him men halted dazzled, and the world wasincandescent. The light found him already upon the outskirts of the excitedcrowds that choked the ways near the wind-vane offices, and the sense ofvisibility and exposure that came with it turned his colourless intention ofjoining Ostrog to a keen anxiety.For a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endangered by men hoarse and wearywith cheering his name, some of them bandaged and bloody in his cause. Thefrontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by some moving picture, butwhat it was he could not see, because in spite of his strenuous attempts thedensity of the crowd prevented his approaching it. From the fragments of speechhe caught, he judged it conveyed news of the fighting about the Council House.Ignorance and indecision made him slow and ineffective in his movements. For atime he could not conceive how he was to get within the unbroken façade of thisplace. He made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of people, until herealised that the descending staircase of the central Way led to the interior ofthe buildings. This gave him a goal, but the crowding in the central path was sodense that it was long before he could reach it. And even then he encounteredintricate obstruction, and had an hour of vivid argument first in this guardroom and then in that before he could get a note taken to the one man of all menwho was most eager to see him. His story was laughed to scorn at one place, andwiser for that, when at last he reached a second stairway he professed simply tohave news of extraordinary importance for Ostrog. What it was he would not say.They sent his note reluctantly. For a long time he waited in a little room atthe foot of the lift shaft, and thither at last came Lincoln, eager, apologetic,astonished. He stopped in the doorway scrutinising Graham, then rushed forwardeffusively.“Yes,” he cried. “It is you. And you are not dead!”Graham made a brief explanation.“My brother is waiting,” explained Lincoln. “He is alone in the wind-vaneoffices. We feared you had been killed in the theatre. He doubted—and things arevery urgent still in spite of what we are telling them there—or he would havecome to you.”They ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage, crossed a great hall, emptysave for two hurrying messengers, and entered a comparatively little room, whoseonly furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc of cloudy, shifting grey,hung by cables from the wall. There Lincoln left Graham for a space, and heremained alone without understanding the shifting smoky shapes that drove slowlyacross this disc.His attention was arrested by a sound that began abruptly. It was cheering, thefrantic cheering of a vast but very remote crowd, a roaring exultation. Thisended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound heard between the opening andshutting of a door. In the outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and amelodious clinking as if a loose chain was running over the teeth of a wheel.Then he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of unseen garments. “It isOstrog!” he heard her say. A little bell rang fitfully, and then everything wasstill again.Presently came voices, footsteps and movement without. The footsteps of some oneperson detached itself from the other sounds and drew near, firm, evenlymeasured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall, white-haired man, clad ingarments of cream-coloured silk, appeared, regarding Graham from under hisraised arm.For a moment the white form remained holding the curtain, then dropped it andstood before it. Graham’s first impression was of a very broad forehead, verypale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an aquiline nose, and aheavily-lined resolute mouth. The folds of flesh over the eyes, the drooping ofthe corners of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing, and said the man wasold. Graham rose to his feet instinctively, and for a moment the two men stoodin silence, regarding each other.“You are Ostrog?” said Graham.“I am Ostrog.”“The Boss?”“So I am called.”Graham felt the inconvenience of the silence. “I have to thank you chiefly, Iunderstand, for my safety,” he said presently.“We were afraid you were killed,” said Ostrog. “Or sent to sleep again—for ever.We have been doing everything to keep our secret—the secret of yourdisappearance. Where have you been? How did you get here?”Graham told him briefly.Ostrog listened in silence.He smiled faintly. “Do you know what I was doing when they came to tell me youhad come?”“How can I guess?”“Preparing your double.”“My double?”“A man as like you as we could find. We were going to hypnotise him, to save himthe difficulty of acting. It was imperative. The whole of this revolt depends onthe idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even now a great multitude ofpeople has gathered in the theatre clamouring to see you. They do not trust . .. You know, of course—something of your position?”“Very little,” said Graham.“It is like this.” Ostrog walked a pace or two into the room and turned. “Youare absolute owner,” he said, “of more than half the world. As a result of thatyou are practically King. Your powers are limited in many intricate ways, butyou are the figurehead, the popular symbol of government. This White Council,the Council of Trustees as it is called—”“I have heard the vague outline of these things.”“I wondered.”“I came upon a garrulous old man.”“I see. . . . Our masses—the word comes from your days—you know of course, thatwe still have masses—regard you as our actual ruler. Just as a great number ofpeople in your days regarded the Crown as the ruler. They are discontented—themasses all over the earth—with the rule of your Trustees. For the most part itis the old discontent, the old quarrel of the common man with his commonness—themisery of work and discipline and unfitness. But your Trustees have ruled ill.In certain matters, in the administration of the Labour Companies, for example,they have been unwise. They have given endless opportunities. Already we of thepopular party were agitating for reforms—when your waking came. Came! If it hadbeen contrived it could not have come more opportunely.” He smiled. “The publicmind, making no allowance for your years of quiescence, had already hit on thethought of waking you and appealing to you, and— Flash!”He indicated the outbreak by a gesture, and Graham moved his head to show thathe understood.“The Council muddled—quarrelled. They always do. They could not decide what todo with you. You know how they imprisoned you?”“I see. I see. And now—we win?”“We win. Indeed we win. Tonight, in five swift hours. Suddenly we struckeverywhere. The wind-vane people, the Labour Company and its millions, burst thebonds. We got the pull of the aëropiles.”He paused. “Yes,” said Graham, guessing that aëropile meant flying machine.“That was, of course, essential. Or they could have got away. All the city rose,every third man almost was in it! All the blue, all the public services, saveonly just a few aëronauts and about half the red police. You were rescued, andtheir own police of the ways—not half of them could be massed at the CouncilHouse—have been broken up, disarmed or killed. All London is ours—now. Only theCouncil House remains.“Half of those who remain to them of the red police were lost in that foolishattempt to recapture you. They lost their heads when they lost you. They flungall they had at the theatre. We cut them off from the Council House there. Trulytonight has been a night of victory. Everywhere your star has blazed. A dayago—the White Council ruled as it has ruled for a gross of years, for a centuryand a half of years, and then, with only a little whispering, a covert arminghere and there, suddenly—So!”“I am very ignorant,” said Graham. “I suppose—. I do not clearly understand theconditions of this fighting. If you could explain. Where is the Council? Whereis the fight?”Ostrog stepped across the room, something clicked, and suddenly, save for anoval glow, they were in darkness. For a moment Graham was puzzled.Then he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken depth and colour, had assumedthe appearance of an oval window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar scene.At the first glance he was unable to guess what this scene might be. It was adaylight scene, the daylight of a wintry day, grey and clear. Across the pictureand halfway as it seemed between him and the remoter view, a stout cable oftwisted white wire stretched vertically. Then he perceived that the rows ofgreat wind-wheels he saw, the wide intervals, the occasional gulfs of darkness,were akin to those through which he had fled from the Council House. Hedistinguished an orderly file of red figures marching across an open spacebetween files of men in black, and realised before Ostrog spoke that he waslooking down on the upper surface of latter-day London. The overnight snows hadgone. He judged that this mirror was some modern replacement of the cameraobscura, but that matter was not explained to him. He saw that though the fileof red figures was trotting from left to right, yet they were passing out of thepicture to the left. He wondered momentarily, and then saw that the picture waspassing slowly, panorama fashion, across the oval.“In a moment you will see the fighting,” said Ostrog at his elbow. “Thosefellows in red you notice are prisoners. This is the roof space of London—allthe houses are practically continuous now. The streets and public squares arecovered in. The gaps and chasms of your time have disappeared.”Something out of focus obliterated half the picture. Its form suggested a man.There was a gleam of metal, a flash, something that swept across the oval, asthe eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye, and the picture was clear again. Andnow Graham beheld men running down among the wind-wheels, pointing weapons fromwhich jetted out little smoky flashes. They swarmed thicker and thicker to theright, gesticulating—it might be they were shouting, but of that the picturetold nothing. They and the wind-wheels passed slowly and steadily across thefield of the mirror.“Now,” said Ostrog, “comes the Council House,” and slowly a black edge creptinto view and gathered Graham’s attention. Soon it was no longer an edge but acavity, a huge blackened space amidst the clustering edifices, and from it thinspires of smoke rose into the pallid winter sky. Gaunt ruinous masses of thebuilding, mighty truncated piers and girders, rose dismally out of thiscavernous darkness. And over these vestiges of some splendid place, countlessminute men were clambering, leaping, swarming.“This is the Council House,” said Ostrog. “Their last stronghold. And the foolswasted enough ammunition to hold out for a month in blowing up the buildings allabout them—to stop our attack. You heard the smash? It shattered half thebrittle glass in the city.”And while he spoke, Graham saw that beyond this area of ruins, overhanging itand rising to a great height, was a ragged mass of white building. This mass hadbeen isolated by the ruthless destruction of its surroundings. Black gaps markedthe passages the disaster had torn apart; big halls had been slashed open andthe decoration of their interiors showed dismally in the wintry dawn, and downthe jagged walls hung festoons of divided cables and twisted ends of lines andmetallic rods. And amidst all the vast details moved little red specks, thered-clothed defenders of the Council. Every now and then faint flashesilluminated the bleak shadows. At the first sight it seemed to Graham that anattack upon this isolated white building was in progress, but then he perceivedthat the party of the revolt was not advancing, but sheltered amidst thecolossal wreckage that encircled this last ragged stronghold of the red-garbedmen, was keeping up a fitful firing.And not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the ventilating fans in a littlechamber within that remote building wondering what was happening in the world!Looking more attentively as this warlike episode moved silently across thecentre of the mirror, Graham saw that the white building was surrounded on everyside by ruins, and Ostrog proceeded to describe in concise phrases how itsdefenders had sought by such destruction to isolate themselves from a storm. Hespoke of the loss of men that huge downfall had entailed in an indifferent tone.He indicated an improvised mortuary among the wreckage, showed ambulancesswarming like cheese-mites along a ruinous groove that had once been a street ofmoving ways. He was more interested in pointing out the parts of the CouncilHouse, the distribution of the besiegers. In a little while the civil contestthat had convulsed London was no longer a mystery to Graham. It was notumultuous revolt had occurred that night, no equal warfare, but a splendidlyorganised coup d’état. Ostrog’s grasp of details was astonishing; he seemed toknow the business of even the smallest knot of black and red specks that crawledamidst these places.He stretched a huge black arm across the luminous picture, and showed the roomwhence Graham had escaped, and across the chasm of ruins the course of hisflight. Graham recognised the gulf across which the gutter ran, and thewind-wheels where he had crouched from the flying machine. The rest of his pathhad succumbed to the explosion. He looked again at the Council House, and it wasalready half hidden, and on the right a hillside with a cluster of domes andpinnacles, hazy, dim and distant, was gliding into view.“And the Council is really overthrown?” he said.“Overthrown,” said Ostrog.“And I—. Is it indeed true that I—?”“You are Master of the World.”“But that white flag—”“That is the flag of the Council—the flag of the Rule of the World. It willfall. The fight is over. Their attack on the theatre was their last franticstruggle. They have only a thousand men or so, and some of these men will bedisloyal. They have little ammunition. And we are reviving the ancient arts. Weare casting guns.”“But—help. Is this city the world?”“Practically this is all they have left to them of their empire. Abroad thecities have either revolted with us or wait the issue. Your awakening hasperplexed them, paralysed them.”“But haven’t the Council flying machines? Why is there no fighting with them?”“They had. But the greater part of the aëronauts were in the revolt with us.They wouldn’t take the risk of fighting on our side, but they would not stiragainst us. We had to get a pull with the aëronauts. Quite half were with us,and the others knew it. Directly they knew you had got away, those looking foryou dropped. We killed the man who shot at you—an hour ago. And we occupied theflying stages at the outset in every city we could, and so stopped and capturedthe aëroplanes, and as for the little flying machines that turned out—for somedid—we kept up too straight and steady a fire for them to get near the CouncilHouse. If they dropped they couldn’t rise again, because there’s no clear spaceabout there for them to get up. Several we have smashed, several others havedropped and surrendered, the rest have gone off to the Continent to find afriendly city if they can before their fuel runs out. Most of these men wereonly too glad to be taken prisoner and kept out of harm’s way. Upsetting in aflying machine isn’t a very attractive prospect. There’s no chance for theCouncil that way. Its days are done.”He laughed and turned to the oval reflection again to show Graham what he meantby flying stages. Even the four nearer ones were remote and obscured by a thinmorning haze. But Graham could perceive they were very vast structures, judgedeven by the standard of the things about them.And then as these dim shapes passed to the left there came again the sight ofthe expanse across which the disarmed men in red had been marching. And then theblack ruins, and then again the beleaguered white fastness of the Council. Itappeared no longer a ghostly pile, but glowing amber in the sunlight, for acloud shadow had passed. About it the pigmy struggle still hung in suspense, butnow the red defenders were no longer firing.So, in a dusky stillness, the man from the nineteenth century saw the closingscene of the great revolt, the forcible establishment of his rule. With aquality of startling discovery it came to him that this was his world, and notthat other he had left behind; that this was no spectacle to culminate andcease; that in this world lay whatever life was still before him, lay all hisduties and dangers and responsibilities. He turned with fresh questions. Ostrogbegan to answer them, and then broke off abruptly. “But these things I mustexplain more fully later. At present there are—duties. The people are coming bythe moving ways towards this ward from every part of the city—the markets andtheatres are densely crowded. You are just in time for them. They are clamouringto see you. And abroad they want to see you. Paris, New York, Chicago, Denver,Capri—thousands of cities are up and in a tumult, undecided, and clamouring tosee you. They have clamoured that you should be awakened for years, and now itis done they will scarcely believe—”“But surely—I can’t go . . .”Ostrog answered from the other side of the room, and the picture on the ovaldisc paled and vanished as the light jerked back again. “There arekinetotele-photographs,” he said. “As you bow to the people here—all over theworld myriads of myriads of people, packed and still in darkened halls, will seeyou also. In black and white, of course—not like this. And you will hear theirshouts reinforcing the shouting in the hall.“And there is an optical contrivance we shall use,” said Ostrog, “used by someof the posturers and women dancers. It may be novel to you. You stand in a verybright light, and they see not you but a magnified image of you thrown on ascreen—so that even the furtherest man in the remotest gallery can, if hechooses, count your eyelashes.”Graham clutched desperately at one of the questions in his mind. “What is thepopulation of London?” he said.“Eight and twaindy myriads.”“Eight and what?”“More than thirty-three millions.”These figures went beyond Graham’s imagination.“You will be expected to say something,” said Ostrog. “Not what you used to calla Speech, but what our people call a Word—just one sentence, six or seven words.Something formal. If I might suggest—‘I have awakened and my heart is with you.’That is the sort of thing they want.”“What was that?” asked Graham.“ ‘I am awakened and my heart is with you.’ And bow—bow royally. But first wemust get you black robes—for black is your colour. Do you mind? And then theywill disperse to their homes.”Graham hesitated. “I am in your hands,” he said.Ostrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought for a moment, turned to thecurtain and called brief directions to some unseen attendants. Almostimmediately a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe Graham had worn inthe theatre, was brought. And as he threw it about his shoulders there came fromthe room without the shrilling of a high-pitched bell. Ostrog turned ininterrogation to the attendant, then suddenly seemed to change his mind, pulledthe curtain aside and disappeared.For a moment Graham stood with the deferential attendant listening to Ostrog’sretreating steps. There was a sound of quick question and answer and of menrunning. The curtain was snatched back and Ostrog reappeared, his massive faceglowing with excitement. He crossed the room in a stride, clicked the room intodarkness, gripped Graham’s arm and pointed to the mirror.“Even as we turned away,” he said.Graham saw his index finger, black and colossal, above the mirrored CouncilHouse. For a moment he did not understand. And then he perceived that theflagstaff that had carried the white banner was bare.“Do you mean—?” he began.“The Council has surrendered. Its rule is at an end for evermore.”“Look!” and Ostrog pointed to a coil of black that crept in little jerks up thevacant flagstaff, unfolding as it rose.The oval picture paled as Lincoln pulled the curtain aside and entered.“They are clamourous,” he said.Ostrog kept his grip of Graham’s arm.“We have raised the people,” he said. “We have given them arms. For today atleast their wishes must be law.”Lincoln held the curtain open for Graham and Ostrog to pass through. . . .On his way to the markets Graham had a transitory glance of a long narrowwhite-walled room in which men in the universal blue canvas were carryingcovered things like biers, and about which men in medical purple hurried to andfro. From this room came groans and wailing. He had an impression of an emptyblood-stained couch, of men on other couches, bandaged and blood-stained. It wasjust a glimpse from a railed footway and then a buttress hid the place and theywere going on towards the markets. . . .The roar of the multitude was near now: it leapt to thunder. And, arresting hisattention, a fluttering of black banners, the waving of blue canvas and brownrags, and the swarming vastness of the theatre near the public markets came intoview down a long passage. The picture opened out. He perceived they wereentering the great theatre of his first appearance, the great theatre he hadlast seen as a chequer-work of glare and blackness in his flight from the redpolice. This time he entered it along a gallery at a level high above the stage.The place was now brilliantly lit again. He sought the gangway up which he hadfled, but he could not tell it from among its dozens of fellows; nor could hesee anything of the smashed seats, deflated cushions, and such like traces ofthe fight because of the density of the people. Except the stage the whole placewas closely packed. Looking down the effect was a vast area of stippled pink,each dot a still upturned face regarding him. At his appearance with Ostrog thecheering died away, the singing died away, a common interest stilled and unifiedthe disorder. It seemed as though every individual of those myriads was watchinghim."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13THE END OF THE OLD ORDERSo far as Graham was able to judge, it was near midday when the white banner ofthe Council fell. But some hours had to elapse before it was possible to effectthe formal capitulation, and so after he had spoken his “Word” he retired to hisnew apartments in the wind-vane offices. The continuous excitement of the lasttwelve hours had left him inordinately fatigued, even his curiosity wasexhausted; for a space he sat inert and passive with open eyes, and for a spacehe slept. He was roused by two medical attendants, come prepared with stimulantsto sustain him through the next occasion. After he had taken their drugs andbathed by their advice in cold water, he felt a rapid return of interest andenergy, and was presently able and willing to accompany Ostrog through severalmiles (as it seemed) of passages, lifts, and slides to the closing scene of theWhite Council’s rule.The way ran deviously through a maze of buildings. They came at last to apassage that curved about, and showed broadening before him an oblong opening,clouds hot with sunset, and the ragged skyline of the ruinous Council House. Atumult of shouts came drifting up to him. In another moment they had come outhigh up on the brow of the cliff of torn buildings that overhung the wreckage.The vast area opened to Graham’s eyes, none the less strange and wonderful forthe remote view he had had of it in the oval mirror.This rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the better part of a mile to itsouter edge. It was gold lit on the left hand, catching the sunlight, and belowand to the right clear and cold in the shadow. Above the shadowy grey CouncilHouse that stood in the midst of it, the great black banner of the surrenderstill hung in sluggish folds against the blazing sunset. Severed rooms, hallsand passages gaped strangely, broken masses of metal projected dismally from thecomplex wreckage, vast masses of twisted cable dropped like tangled seaweed, andfrom its base came a tumult of innumerable voices, violent concussions, and thesound of trumpets. All about this great white pile was a ring of desolation; thesmashed and blackened masses, the gaunt foundations and ruinous lumber of thefabric that had been destroyed by the Council’s orders, skeletons of girders,Titanic masses of wall, forests of stout pillars. Amongst the sombre wreckagebeneath, running water flashed and glistened, and far away across the space, outof the midst of a vague vast mass of buildings, there thrust the twisted end ofa water-main, two hundred feet in the air, thunderously spouting a shiningcascade. And everywhere great multitudes of people.Wherever there was space and foothold, people swarmed, little people, small andminutely clear, except where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold.They clambered up the tottering walls, they clung in wreaths and groups aboutthe high-standing pillars. They swarmed along the edges of the circle of ruins.The air was full of their shouting, and they were pressing and swaying towardsthe central space.The upper storeys of the Council House seemed deserted, not a human being wasvisible. Only the drooping banner of the surrender hung heavily against thelight. The dead were within the Council House, or hidden by the swarming people,or carried away. Graham could see only a few neglected bodies in gaps andcorners of the ruins, and amidst the flowing water.“Will you let them see you, Sire?” said Ostrog. “They are very anxious to seeyou.”Graham hesitated, and then walked forward to where the broken verge of walldropped sheer. He stood looking down, a lonely, tall, black figure against thesky.Very slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him. And as they did so littlebands of black-uniformed men appeared remotely, thrusting through the crowdstowards the Council House. He saw little black heads become pink, looking athim, saw by that means a wave of recognition sweep across the space. It occurredto him that he should accord them some recognition. He held up his arm, thenpointed to the Council House and dropped his hand. The voices below becameunanimous, gathered volume, came up to him as multitudinous wavelets ofcheering.The western sky was a pallid bluish green, and Jupiter shone high in the south,before the capitulation was accomplished. Above was a slow insensible change,the advance of night serene and beautiful; below was hurry, excitement,conflicting orders, pauses, spasmodic developments of organisation, a vastascending clamour and confusion. Before the Council came out, toiling perspiringmen, directed by a conflict of shouts, carried forth hundreds of those who hadperished in the hand-to-hand conflict within those long passages and chambers.Guards in black lined the way that the Council would come, and as far as the eyecould reach into the hazy blue twilight of the ruins, and swarming now at everypossible point in the captured Council House and along the shattered cliff ofits circum-adjacent buildings, were innumerable people, and their voices evenwhen they were not cheering, were as the soughing of the sea upon a pebblebeach. Ostrog had chosen a huge commanding pile of crushed and overthrownmasonry, and on this a stage of timbers and metal girders was being hastilyconstructed. Its essential parts were complete, but humming and clangorousmachinery still glared fitfully in the shadows beneath this temporary edifice.The stage had a small higher portion on which Graham stood with Ostrog andLincoln close beside him, a little in advance of a group of minor officers. Abroader lower stage surrounded this quarter deck, and on this were theblack-uniformed guards of the revolt armed with the little green weapons whosevery names Graham still did not know. Those standing about him perceived thathis eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming people in the twilight ruinsabout him to the darkling mass of the White Council House, whence the Trusteeswould presently come, and to the gaunt cliffs of ruin that encircled him, and soback to the people. The voices of the crowd swelled to a deafening tumult.He saw the Councillors first afar off in the glare of one of the temporarylights that marked their path, a little group of white figures blinking in ablack archway. In the Council House they had been in darkness. He watched themapproaching, drawing nearer past first this blazing electric star and then that;the minatory roar of the crowd over whom their power had lasted for a hundredand fifty years marched along beside them. As they drew still nearer their facescame out weary, white and anxious. He saw them blinking up through the glareabout him and Ostrog. He contrasted their strange cold looks in the Hall ofAtlas. . . . Presently he could recognise several of them; the man who hadrapped the table at Howard, a burly man with a red beard, and onedelicate-featured, short, dark man with a peculiarly long skull. He noted thattwo were whispering together and looking behind him at Ostrog. Next there came atall, dark and handsome man, walking downcast. Abruptly he glanced up, his eyestouched Graham for a moment, and passed beyond him to Ostrog. The way that hadbeen made for them was so contrived that they had to march past and curve aboutbefore they came to the sloping path of planks that ascended to the stage wheretheir surrender was to be made.“The Master, the Master! God and the Master,” shouted the people. “To hell withthe Council!” Graham looked at their multitudes, receding beyond counting into ashouting haze, and then at Ostrog beside him, white and steadfast and still. Hiseye went again to the little group of White Councillors. And then he looked upat the familiar quiet stars overhead. The marvellous element in his fate wassuddenly vivid. Could that be his indeed, that little life in his memory twohundred years gone by—and this as well?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14FROM THE CROW’S NESTAnd so after strange delays and through an avenue of doubt and battle, this manfrom the nineteenth century came at last to his position at the head of thatcomplex world.At first when he rose from the long deep sleep that followed his rescue and thesurrender of the Council, he did not recognise his surroundings. By an effort hegained a clue in his mind, and all that had happened came back to him, at firstwith a quality of insincerity like a story heard, like something read out of abook. And even before his memories were clear, the exultation of his escape, thewonder of his prominence were back in his mind. He was owner of half the world;Master of the Earth. This new great age was in the completest sense his. He nolonger hoped to discover his experiences a dream; he became anxious now toconvince himself that they were real.An obsequious valet assisted him to dress under the direction of a dignifiedchief attendant, a little man whose face proclaimed him Japanese, albeit hespoke English like an Englishman. From the latter he learnt something of thestate of affairs. Already the revolution was an accepted fact; already businesswas being resumed throughout the city. Abroad the downfall of the Council hadbeen received for the most part with delight. Nowhere was the Council popular,and the thousand cities of Western America, after two hundred years stilljealous of New York, London, and the East, had risen almost unanimously two daysbefore at the news of Graham’s imprisonment. Paris was fighting within itself.The rest of the world hung in suspense.While he was breaking his fast, the sound of a telephone bell jetted from acorner, and his chief attendant called his attention to the voice of Ostrogmaking polite enquiries. Graham interrupted his refreshment to reply. Veryshortly Lincoln arrived, and Graham at once expressed a strong desire to talk topeople and to be shown more of the new life that was opening before him. Lincolninformed him that in three hours’ time a representative gathering of officialsand their wives would be held in the state apartments of the wind-vane Chief.Graham’s desire to traverse the ways of the city was, however, at presentimpossible, because of the enormous excitement of the people. It was, however,quite possible for him to take a bird’s-eye view of the city from the crow’snest of the wind-vane keeper. To this accordingly Graham was conducted by hisattendant. Lincoln, with a graceful compliment to the attendant, apologised fornot accompanying them, on account of the present pressure of administrativework.Higher even than the most gigantic wind-wheels hung this crow’s nest, a clearthousand feet above the roofs, a little disc-shaped speck on a spear of metallicfiligree, cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn in a little wire-hungcradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming stem was a light gallery about which hunga cluster of tubes—minute they looked from above— rotating slowly on the ring ofits outer rail. These were the specula, en rapport with the wind-vane keeper’smirrors, in one of which Ostrog had shown him the coming of his rule. HisJapanese attendant ascended before him and they spent nearly an hour asking andanswering questions.It was a day full of the promise and quality of spring. The touch of the windwarmed. The sky was an intense blue and the vast expanse of London shonedazzling under the morning sun. The air was clear of smoke and haze, sweet asthe air of a mountain glen.Save for the irregular oval of ruins about the House of the Council and theblack flag of the surrender that fluttered there, the mighty city seen fromabove showed few signs of the swift revolution that had, to his imagination, inone night and one day, changed the destinies of the world. A multitude of peoplestill swarmed over these ruins, and the huge openwork stagings in the distancefrom which started in times of peace the service of aeroplanes to the variousgreat cities of Europe and America, were also black with the victors. Across anarrow way of planking raised on trestles that crossed the ruins a crowd ofworkmen were busy restoring the connection between the cables and wires of theCouncil House and the rest of the city, preparatory to the transfer thither ofOstrog’s headquarters from the wind-vane buildings.For the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed. So vast was its serenity incomparison with the areas of disturbance, that presently Graham, looking beyondthem, could almost forget the thousands of men lying out of sight in theartificial glare within the quasi-subterranean labyrinth, dead or dying of theovernight wounds, forget the improvised wards with the hosts of surgeons,nurses, and bearers feverishly busy, forget, indeed, all the wonder,consternation and novelty under the electric lights. Down there in the hiddenways of the anthill he knew that the revolution triumphed, that black everywherecarried the day, black favours, black banners, black festoons across thestreets. And out here, under the fresh sunlight, beyond the crater of the fight,as if nothing had happened to the earth, the forest of wind vanes that had grownfrom one or two while the Council had ruled, roared peacefully upon theirincessant duty.Far away, spiked, jagged and indented by the wind vanes, the Surrey Hills roseblue and faint; to the north and nearer, the sharp contours of Highgate andMuswell Hill were similarly jagged. And all over the countryside, he knew, onevery crest and hill, where once the hedges had interlaced, and cottages,churches, inns, and farmhouses had nestled among their trees, wind wheelssimilar to those he saw and bearing like them vast advertisements, gaunt anddistinctive symbols of the new age, cast their whirling shadows and storedincessantly the energy that flowed away incessantly through all the arteries ofthe city. And underneath these wandered the countless flocks and herds of theBritish Food Trust with their lonely guards and keepers.Not a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of gigantic shapes below. St.Paul’s he knew survived, and many of the old buildings in Westminster, embeddedout of sight, arched over and covered in among the giant growths of this greatage. The Thames, too, made no fall and gleam of silver to break the wildernessof the city; the thirsty water mains drank up every drop of its waters beforethey reached the walls. Its bed and estuary, scoured and sunken, was now a canalof sea water and a race of grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials of tradefrom the Pool thereby beneath the very feet of the workers. Faint and dim in theeastward between earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossalshipping in the Pool. For all the heavy traffic, for which there was no need ofhaste, came in gigantic sailing ships from the ends of the earth, and the heavygoods for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a smaller swifter sort.And to the south over the hills, came vast aqueducts with sea water for thesewers and in three separate directions, ran pallid lines—the roads, stippledwith moving grey specks. On the first occasion that offered he was determined togo out and see these roads. That would come after the flying ship he waspresently to try. His attendant officer described them as a pair of gentlycurving surfaces a hundred yards wide, each one for the traffic going in onedirection, and made of a substance called Eadhamite—an artificial substance, sofar as he could gather, resembling toughened glass. Along this shot a strangetraffic of narrow rubber-shod vehicles, great single wheels, two and fourwheeled vehicles, sweeping along at velocities of from one to six miles aminute. Railroads had vanished; a few embankments remained as rust-crownedtrenches here and there. Some few formed the cores of Eadhamite ways.Among the first things to strike his attention had been the great fleets ofadvertisement balloons and kites that receded in irregular vistas northward andsouthward along the lines of the aëroplane journeys. No aëroplanes were to beseen. Their passages had ceased, and only one little-seeming aëropile circledhigh in the blue distance above the Surrey Hills, an unimpressive soaring speck.A thing Graham had already learnt, and which he found very hard to imagine, wasthat nearly all the towns in the country, and almost all the villages, haddisappeared. Here and there only, he understood, some gigantic hotel-likeedifice stood amid square miles of some single cultivation and preserved thename of a town—as Bournemouth, Wareham, or Swanage. Yet the officer had speedilyconvinced him how inevitable such a change had been. The old order had dottedthe country with farmhouses, and every two or three miles was the rulinglandlord’s estate, and the place of the inn and cobbler, the grocer’s shop andchurch— the village. Every eight miles or so was the country town, where lawyer,corn merchant, wool-stapler, saddler, veterinary surgeon, doctor, draper,milliner and so forth lived. Every eight miles— simply because that eight milemarketing journey, four there and back, was as much as was comfortable for thefarmer. But directly the railways came into play, and after them the lightrailways, and all the swift new motor cars that had replaced waggons and horses,and so soon as the high roads began to be made of wood, and rubber, andEadhamite, and all sorts of elastic durable substances— the necessity of havingsuch frequent market towns disappeared. And the big towns grew. They drew theworker with the gravitational force of seemingly endless work, the employer withtheir suggestions of an infinite ocean of labour.And as the standard of comfort rose, as the complexity of the mechanism ofliving increased, life in the country had become more and more costly, or narrowand impossible. The disappearance of vicar and squire, the extinction of thegeneral practitioner by the city specialist, had robbed the village of its lasttouch of culture. After telephone, kinematograph and phonograph had replacednewspaper, book, schoolmaster, and letter, to live outside the range of theelectric cables was to live an isolated savage. In the country were neithermeans of being clothed nor fed (according to the refined conceptions of thetime), no efficient doctors for an emergency, no company and no pursuits.Moreover, mechanical appliances in agriculture made one engineer the equivalentof thirty labourers. So, inverting the condition of the city clerk in the dayswhen London was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly foulness of its air, thelabourers now came hurrying by road or air to the city and its life and delightsat night to leave it again in the morning. The city had swallowed up humanity;man had entered upon a new stage in his development. First had come the nomad,the hunter, then had followed the agriculturist of the agricultural state, whosetowns and cities and ports were but the headquarters and markets of thecountryside. And now, logical consequence of an epoch of invention, was thishuge new aggregation of men. Save London, there were only four other cities inBritain—Edinburgh, Portsmouth, Manchester and Shrewsbury. Such things as these,simple statements of fact though they were to contemporary men, strainedGraham’s imagination to picture. And when he glanced “over beyond there” at thestrange things that existed on the Continent, it failed him altogether.He had a vision of city beyond city, cities on great plains, cities beside greatrivers, vast cities along the sea margin, cities girdled by snowy mountains.Over a great part of the earth the English tongue was spoken; taken togetherwith its Spanish American and Hindoo and negro and “Pidgin” dialects, it was theeveryday language of two-thirds of the people of the earth. On the Continent,save as remote and curious survivals, three other languages alone heldsway—German, which reached to Antioch and Genoa and jostled Spanish-English atCadiz, a Gallicised Russian which met the Indian English in Persia and Kurdistanand the “Pidgin” English in Pekin, and French still clear and brilliant, thelanguage of lucidity, which shared the Mediterranean with the Indian English andGerman and reached through a negro dialect to the Congo.And everywhere now, through the city-set earth, save in the administered “blackbelt” territories of the tropics, the same cosmopolitan social organisationprevailed, and everywhere from Pole to Equator his property and hisresponsibilities extended. The whole world was civilised; the whole world dweltin cities; the whole world was property. Over the British Empire and throughoutAmerica his ownership was scarcely disguised, Congress and Parliament wereusually regarded as antique, curious gatherings. And even in the two Empires ofRussia and Germany, the influence of his wealth was conceivably of enormousweight. There, of course, came problems—possibilities, but, uplifted as he was,even Russia and Germany seemed sufficiently remote. And of the quality of theblack belt administration, and of what that might mean for him he thought, afterthe fashion of his former days, not at all. That it should hang like a threatover the spacious vision before him could not enter his nineteenth century mind.But his mind turned at once from the scenery to the thought of a vanished dread.“What of the yellow peril?” he asked and Asano made him explain. The Chinesespectre had vanished. Chinaman and European were at peace. The twentieth centuryhad discovered with reluctant certainty that the average Chinaman was ascivilised, more moral, and far more intelligent than the average European serf,and had repeated on a gigantic scale the fraternisation of Scot and Englishmanthat happened in the seventeenth century. As Asano put it; “They thought itover. They found we were white men after all.” Graham turned again to the viewand his thoughts took a new direction.Out of the dim south-west, glittering and strange, voluptuous, and in some wayterrible, shone those Pleasure Cities, of which the kinematograph-phonograph andthe old man in the street had spoken. Strange places reminiscent of thelegendary Sybaris, cities of art and beauty, mercenary art and mercenary beauty,sterile wonderful cities of motion and music, whither repaired all who profitedby the fierce, inglorious, economic struggle that went on in the glaringlabyrinth below.Fierce he knew it was. How fierce he could judge from the fact that theselatter-day people referred back to the England of the nineteenth century as thefigure of an idyllic easy-going life. He turned his eyes to the sceneimmediately before him again, trying to conceive the big factories of thatintricate maze.Northward he knew were the potters, makers not only of earthenware and china,but of the kindred pastes and compounds a subtler mineralogical chemistry haddevised; there were the makers of statuettes and wall ornaments and muchintricate furniture; there too were the factories where feverishly competitiveauthors devised their phonograph discourses and advertisements and arranged thegroupings and developments for their perpetually startling and novelkinematographic dramatic works. Thence, too, flashed the world-wide messages,the world-wide falsehoods of the news-tellers, the chargers of the telephonicmachines that had replaced the newspapers of the past.To the westward beyond the smashed Council House were the voluminous offices ofmunicipal control and government; and to the eastward, towards the port, thetrading quarters, the huge public markets, the theatres, houses of resort,betting palaces, miles of billiard saloons, baseball and football circuses, wildbeast rings and the innumerable temples of the Christian and quasi-Christiansects, the Mahomedans, Buddhists, Gnostics, Spook Worshippers, the IncubusWorshippers, the Furniture Worshippers, and so forth; and to the south again avast manufacture of textiles, pickles, wines and condiments. And from point topoint tore the countless multitudes along the roaring mechanical ways. Agigantic hive, of which the winds were tireless servants, and the ceaselesswind-vanes an appropriate crown and symbol.He thought of the unprecedented population that had been sucked up by thissponge of halls and galleries—the thirty-three million lives that were playingout each its own brief ineffectual drama below him, and the complacency that thebrightness of the day and the space and splendour of the view, and above all thesense of his own importance had begotten, dwindled and perished. Looking downfrom this height over the city it became at last possible to conceive thisoverwhelming multitude of thirty-three millions, the reality of theresponsibility he would take upon himself, the vastness of the human Maelstromover which his slender kingship hung.He tried to figure the individual life. It astonished him to realise how littlethe common man had changed in spite of the visible change in his conditions.Life and property, indeed, were secure from violence almost all over the world,zymotic diseases, bacterial diseases of all sorts had practically vanished,everyone had a sufficiency of food and clothing, was warmed in the city ways andsheltered from the weather—so much the almost mechanical progress of science andthe physical organisation of society had accomplished. But the crowd, he wasalready beginning to discover, was a crowd still, helpless in the hands ofdemagogue and organiser, individually cowardly, individually swayed by appetite,collectively incalculable. The memory of countless figures in pale blue canvascame before his mind. Millions of such men and women below him, he knew, hadnever been out of the city, had never seen beyond the little round ofunintelligent grudging participation in the world’s business, and unintelligentdissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier pleasures. He thought of the hopes of hisvanished contemporaries, and for a moment the dream of London in Morris’s quaintold News from Nowhere, and the perfect land of Hudson’s beautiful Crystal Ageappeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite loss. He thought of his ownhopes.For in the latter days of that passionate life that lay now so far behind him,the conception of a free and equal manhood had become a very real thing to him.He had hoped, as indeed his age had hoped, rashly taking it for granted, thatthe sacrifice of the many to the few would some day cease, that a day was nearwhen every child born of woman should have a fair and assured chance ofhappiness. And here, after two hundred years, the same hope, still unfulfilled,cried passionately through the city. After two hundred years, he knew, greaterthan ever, grown with the city to gigantic proportions, were poverty andhelpless labour and all the sorrows of his time.Already he knew something of the history of the intervening years. He had heardnow of the moral decay that had followed the collapse of supernatural religionin the minds of ignoble man, the decline of public honour, the ascendency ofwealth. For men who had lost their belief in God had still kept their faith inproperty, and wealth ruled a venial world.His Japanese attendant, Asano, in expounding the political history of theintervening two centuries, drew an apt image from a seed eaten by insectparasites. First there is the original seed, ripening vigorously enough. Andthen comes some insect and lays an egg under the skin, and behold! in a littlewhile the seed is a hollow shape with an active grub inside that has eaten outits substance. And then comes some secondary parasite, some ichneumon fly, andlays an egg within this grub, and behold! that, too, is a hollow shape, and thenew living thing is inside its predecessor’s skin which itself is snug withinthe seed coat. And the seed coat still keeps its shape, most people think it aseed still, and for all one knows it may still think itself a seed, vigorous andalive. “Your Victorian kingdom,” said Asano, “was like that— kingship with theheart eaten out.” The landowners—the barons and gentry—began ages ago with KingJohn; there were lapses, but they beheaded King Charles, and ended practicallywith King George, a mere husk of a king . . . the real power in the hands oftheir parliament. But the Parliament—the organ of the land-holding tenant-rulinggentry—did not keep its power long. The change had already come in thenineteenth century. The franchises had been broadened until it included massesof ignorant men, “urban myriads,” who went in their featureless thousands tovote together. And the natural consequence of a swarming constituency is therule of the party organisation. Power was passing even in the Victorian time tothe party machinery, secret, complex and corrupt. Very speedily power was in thehands of great men of business who financed the machines. A time came when thereal power and interest of the Empire rested visibly between the two partycouncils, ruling by newspapers and electoral organisations—two small groups ofrich and able men, working at first in opposition, then presently together.There was a reaction of a genteel ineffectual sort. There were numberless booksin existence, Asano said, to prove that—the publication of some of them was asearly as Graham’s sleep—a whole literature of reaction in fact. The party of thereaction seems to have locked itself into its study and rebelled withunflinching determination—on paper. The urgent necessity of either capturing ordepriving the party councils of power is a common suggestion underlying all thethoughtful work of the early twentieth century, both in America and England. Inmost of these things America was a little earlier than England, though bothcountries drove the same way.That counter-revolution never came. It could never organise and keep pure. Therewas not enough of the old sentimentality, the old faith in righteousness, leftamong men. Any organisation that became big enough to influence the polls becamecomplex enough to be undermined, broken up or bought outright by capable richmen. Socialistic and Popular, Reactionary and Purity Parties were all at lastmere Stock Exchange counters, selling their principles to pay for theirelectioneering. And the great concern of the rich was naturally to keep propertyintact, the board clear for the game of trade. Just as the feudal concern hadbeen to keep the board clear for hunting and war. The whole world was exploited,a battlefield of businesses; and financial convulsions, the scourge of currencymanipulation, tariff wars, made more human misery during the twentiethcentury—because the wretchedness was dreary life instead of speedy death—thanhad war, pestilence and famine, in the darkest hours of earlier history.His own part in the development of this time he now knew clearly enough. Throughthe successive phases in the development of this mechanical civilisation, aidingand presently directing its development, there had grown a new power, theCouncil, the board of his trustees. At first it had been a mere chance union ofthe millions of Isbister and Warming, a mere property holding company, thecreation of two childless testators’ whims, but the collective talent of itsfirst constitution had speedily guided it to a vast influence, until by titledeed, loan and share, under a hundred disguises and pseudonyms it had ramifiedthrough the fabric of the American and English States.Wielding an enormous influence and patronage, the Council had early assumed apolitical aspect; and in its development it had continually used its wealth totip the beam of political decisions and its political advantages to grasp yetmore and more wealth. At last the party organisations of two hemispheres were inits hands; it became an inner council of political control. Its last strugglewas with the tacit alliance of the great Jewish families. But these familieswere linked only by a feeble sentiment, at any time inheritance might fling ahuge fragment of their resources to a minor, a woman or a fool, marriages andlegacies alienated hundreds of thousands at one blow. The Council had no suchbreach in its continuity. Steadily, steadfastly it grew.The original Council was not simply twelve men of exceptional ability; theyfused, it was a council of genius. It struck boldly for riches, for politicalinfluence, and the two subserved each other. With amazing foresight it spentgreat sums of money on the art of flying, holding that invention back against anhour foreseen. It used the patent laws, and a thousand half-legal expedients, tohamper all investigators who refused to work with it. In the old days it nevermissed a capable man. It paid his price. Its policy in those days wasvigorous—unerring, and against it as it grew steadily and incessantly was onlythe chaotic selfish rule of the casually rich. In a hundred years Graham hadbecome almost exclusive owner of Africa, of South America, of France, of London,of England and all its influence—for all practical purposes, that is—a power inNorth America—then the dominant power in America. The Council bought andorganised China, drilled Asia, crippled the Old World empires, undermined themfinancially, fought and defeated them.And this spreading usurpation of the world was so dexterously performed—aproteus—hundreds of banks, companies, syndicates, masked the Council’soperations—that it was already far advanced before common men suspected thetyranny that had come. The Council never hesitated, never faltered. Means ofcommunication, land, buildings, governments, municipalities, the territorialcompanies of the tropics, every human enterprise, it gathered greedily. And itdrilled and marshalled its men, its railway police, its roadway police, itshouse guards, and drain and cable guards, its hosts of land-workers. Theirunions it did not fight, but it undermined and betrayed and bought them. Itbought the world at last. And, finally, its culminating stroke was theintroduction of flying.When the Council, in conflict with the workers in some of its huge monopolies,did something flagrantly illegal and that without even the ordinary civility ofbribery, the old Law, alarmed for the profits of its complaisance, looked aboutit for weapons. But there were no more armies, no fighting navies; the age ofPeace had come. The only possible war ships were the great steam vessels of theCouncil’s Navigation Trust. The police forces they controlled; the police of therailways, of the ships, of their agricultural estates, their time-keepers andorder-keepers, outnumbered the neglected little forces of the old country andmunicipal organisations ten to one. And they produced flying machines. Therewere men alive still who could remember the last great debate in the LondonHouse of Commons—the legal party, the party against the Council was in aminority, but it made a desperate fight—and how the members came crowding outupon the terrace to see these great unfamiliar winged shapes circling quietlyoverhead. The Council had soared to its power. The last sham of a democracy thathad permitted unlimited irresponsible property was at an end.Within one hundred and fifty years of Graham’s falling asleep, his Council hadthrown off its disguises and ruled openly, supreme in his name. Elections hadbecome a cheerful formality, a septennial folly, an ancient unmeaning custom; asocial Parliament as ineffectual as the convocation of the Established Church inVictorian times assembled now and then; and a legitimate King of England,disinherited, drunken and witless, played foolishly in a second-rate music-hall.So the magnificent dream of the nineteenth century, the noble project ofuniversal individual liberty and universal happiness, touched by a disease ofhonour, crippled by a superstition of absolute property, crippled by thereligious feuds that had robbed the common citizens of education, robbed men ofstandards of conduct, and brought the sanctions of morality to utter contempt,had worked itself out in the face of invention and ignoble enterprise, first toa warring plutocracy, and finally to the rule of a supreme plutocrat. HisCouncil at last had ceased even to trouble to have its decrees endorsed by theconstitutional authorities, and he a motionless, sunken, yellow-skinned figurehad lain, neither dead nor living, recognisably and immediately Master of theEarth. And awoke at last to find himself—Master of that inheritance! Awoke tostand under the cloudless empty sky and gaze down upon the greatness of hisdominion.To what end had he awakened? Was this city, this hive of hopeless toilers, thefinal refutation of his ancient hopes? Or was the fire of liberty, the fire thathad blazed and waned in the years of his past life, still smouldering belowthere? He thought of the stir and impulse of the song of the revolution. Wasthat song merely the trick of a demagogue, to be forgotten when its purpose wasserved? Was the hope that still stirred within him only the memory of abandonedthings, the vestige of a creed outworn? Or had it a wider meaning, an importinterwoven with the destiny of man? To what end had he awakened, what was therefor him to do? Humanity was spread below him like a map. He thought of themillions and millions of humanity following each other unceasingly for ever outof the darkness of non-existence into the darkness of death. To what end? Aimthere must be, but it transcended his power of thought. He saw for the firsttime clearly his own infinite littleness, saw stark and terrible the tragiccontrast of human strength and the craving of the human heart. For that littlewhile he knew himself for the petty accident he was, and knew therewith thegreatness of his desire. And suddenly his littleness was intolerable, hisaspiration was intolerable, and there came to him an irresistible impulse topray. And he prayed. He prayed vague, incoherent, contradictory things, his soulstrained up through time and space and all the fleeting multitudinous confusionof being, towards something—he scarcely knew what—towards something that couldcomprehend his striving and endure.A man and a woman were far below on a roof space to the southward enjoying thefreshness of the morning air. The man had brought out a perspective glass to spyupon the Council House and he was showing her how to use it. Presently theircuriosity was satisfied, they could see no traces of bloodshed from theirposition, and after a survey of the empty sky she came round to the crow’s nest.And there she saw two little black figures, so small it was hard to believe theywere men, one who watched and one who gesticulated with hands outstretched tothe silent emptiness of Heaven.She handed the glass to the man. He looked and exclaimed:“I believe it is the Master. Yes. I am sure. It is the Master!”He lowered the glass and looked at her. “Waving his hands about almost as if hewas praying. I wonder what he is up to. Worshipping the sun? There weren’tParsees in this country in his time, were there?”He looked again. “He’s stopped it now. It was a chance attitude, I suppose.” Heput down the glass and became meditative. “He won’t have anything to do butenjoy himself—just enjoy himself. Ostrog will boss the show of course. Ostrogwill have to, because of keeping all these Labourer fools in bounds. Them andtheir song! And got it all by sleeping, dear eyes—just sleeping. It’s awonderful world.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15PROMINENT PEOPLEThe state apartments of the wind vane keeper would have seemed astonishinglyintricate to Graham had he entered them fresh from his nineteenth century life,but already he was growing accustomed to the scale of the new time. They canscarcely be described as halls and rooms, seeing that a complicated system ofarches, bridges, passages and galleries divided and united every part of thegreat space. He came out through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon aplateau of landing at the head of a flight of very broad and gentle steps, withmen and women far more brilliantly dressed than any he had hitherto seenascending and descending. From this position he looked down a vista of intricateornament in lustreless white and mauve and purple, spanned by bridges thatseemed wrought of porcelain and filigree, and terminating far off in a cloudymystery of perforated screens.Glancing upward, he saw tier above tier of ascending galleries with faceslooking down upon him. The air was full of the babble of innumerable voices andof a music that descended from above, a gay and exhilarating music whose sourcehe never discovered. The central aisle was thick with people, but by no meansuncomfortably crowded; altogether that assembly must have numbered manythousands. They were brilliantly, even fantastically dressed, the men asfancifully as the women, for the sobering influence of the Puritan conception ofdignity upon masculine dress had long since passed away. The hair of the men,too, though it was rarely worn long, was commonly curled in a manner thatsuggested the barber, and baldness had vanished from the earth. Frizzystraight-cut masses that would have charmed Rossetti abounded, and onegentleman, who was pointed out to Graham under the mysterious title of an“amorist,” wore his hair in two becoming plaits a la Marguerite. The pigtail wasin evidence; it would seem that citizens of Chinese extraction were no longerashamed of their race. There was little uniformity of fashion apparent in theforms of clothing worn. The more shapely men displayed their symmetry in trunkhose, and here were puffs and slashes, and there a cloak and there a robe. Thefashions of the days of Leo the Tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence, butthe aesthetic conceptions of the far east were also patent. Masculineembonpoint, which, in Victorian times, would have been subjected to the tightlybuttoned perils, the ruthless exaggeration of tight-legged tight-armed eveningdress, now formed but the basis of a wealth of dignity and drooping folds.Graceful slenderness abounded also. To Graham, a typically stiff man from atypically stiff period, not only did these men seem altogether too graceful inperson, but altogether too expressive in their vividly expressive faces. Theygesticulated, they expressed surprise, interest, amusement, above all, theyexpressed the emotions excited in their minds by the ladies about them withastonishing frankness. Even at the first glance it was evident that women werein a great majority.The ladies in the company of these gentlemen displayed in dress, bearing andmanner alike, less emphasis and more intricacy. Some affected a classicalsimplicity of robing and subtlety of fold, after the fashion of the First FrenchEmpire, and flashed conquering arms and shoulders as Graham passed. Others hadclosely-fitting dresses without seam or belt at the waist, sometimes with longfolds falling from the shoulders. The delightful confidences of evening dresshad not been diminished by the passage of two centuries.Everyone’s movements seemed graceful. Graham remarked to Lincoln that he saw menas Raphael’s cartoons walking, and Lincoln told him that the attainment of anappropriate set of gestures was part of every rich person’s education. TheMaster’s entry was greeted with a sort of tittering applause, but these peopleshowed their distinguished manners by not crowding upon him nor annoying him byany persistent scrutiny, as he descended the steps towards the floor of theaisle.He had already learnt from Lincoln that these were the leaders of existingLondon society; almost every person there that night was either a powerfulofficial or the immediate connexion of a powerful official. Many had returnedfrom the European Pleasure Cities expressly to welcome him. The aëronauticauthorities, whose defection had played a part in the overthrow of the Councilonly second to Graham’s were very prominent, and so, too, was the Wind VaneControl. Amongst others there were several of the more prominent officers of theFood Trust; the controller of the European Piggeries had a particularlymelancholy and interesting countenance and a daintily cynical manner. A bishopin full canonicals passed athwart Graham’s vision, conversing with a gentlemandressed exactly like the traditional Chaucer, including even the laurel wreath.“Who is that?” he asked almost involuntarily.“The Bishop of London,” said Lincoln.“No—the other, I mean.”“Poet Laureate.”“You still——?”“He doesn’t make poetry, of course. He’s a cousin of Wotton— one of theCouncillors. But he’s one of the Red Rose Royalists— a delightful club—and theykeep up the tradition of these things.”“Asano told me there was a King.”“The King doesn’t belong. They had to expel him. It’s the Stuart blood, Isuppose; but really—”“Too much?”“Far too much.”Graham did not quite follow all this, but it seemed part of the generalinversion of the new age. He bowed condescendingly to his first introduction. Itwas evident that subtle distinctions of class prevailed even in this assembly,that only to a small proportion of the guests, to an inner group, did Lincolnconsider it appropriate to introduce him. This first introduction was the MasterAëronaut, a man whose sun-tanned face contrasted oddly with the delicatecomplexions about him. Just at present his critical defection from the Councilmade him a very important person indeed.His manner contrasted very favourably, according to Graham’s ideas, with thegeneral bearing. He made a few commonplace remarks, assurances of loyalty andfrank inquiries about the Master’s health. His manner was breezy, his accentlacked the easy staccato of latter-day English. He made it admirably clear toGraham that he was a bluff “aërial dog”—he used that phrase—that there was nononsense about him, that he was a thoroughly manly fellow and old-fashioned atthat, that he didn’t profess to know much, and that what he did not know was notworth knowing. He made a manly bow, ostentatiously free from obsequiousness, andpassed.“I am glad to see that type endures,” said Graham.“Phonographs and kinematographs,” said Lincoln, a little spitefully. “He hasstudied from the life.” Graham glanced at the burly form again. It was oddlyreminiscent.“As a matter of fact we bought him,” said Lincoln. “Partly. And partly he wasafraid of Ostrog. Everything rested with him.”He turned sharply to introduce the Surveyor-General of the Public School Trust.This person was a willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown, he beamed downupon Graham through pince-nez of a Victorian pattern, and illustrated hisremarks by gestures of a beautifully manicured hand. Graham was immediatelyinterested in this gentleman’s functions, and asked him a number of singularlydirect questions. The Surveyor-General seemed quietly amused at the Master’sfundamental bluntness. He was a little vague as to the monopoly of education hisCompany possessed; it was done by contract with the syndicate that ran thenumerous London Municipalities, but he waxed enthusiastic over educationalprogress since the Victorian times. “We have conquered Cram,” he said,“completely conquered Cram— there is not an examination left in the world.Aren’t you glad?”“How do you get the work done?” asked Graham.“We make it attractive—as attractive as possible. And if it does not attractthen—we let it go. We cover an immense field.”He proceeded to details, and they had a lengthy conversation. TheSurveyor-General mentioned the names of Pestalozzi and Froebel with profoundrespect, although he displayed no intimacy with their epoch-making works. Grahamlearnt that University Extension still existed in a modified form. “There is acertain type of girl, for example,” said the Surveyor-General, dilating with asense of his usefulness, “with a perfect passion for severe studies—when theyare not too difficult you know. We cater for them by the thousand. At thismoment,” he said with a Napoleonic touch, “nearly five hundred phonographs arelecturing in different parts of London on the influence exercised by Plato andSwift on the love affairs of Shelley, Hazlitt, and Burns. And afterwards theywrite essays on the lectures, and the names in order of merit are put inconspicuous places. You see how your little germ has grown? The illiteratemiddle-class of your days has quite passed away.”“About the public elementary schools,” said Graham. “Do you control them?”The Surveyor-General did, “entirely.” Now, Graham, in his later democratic days,had taken a keen interest in these and his questioning quickened. Certain casualphrases that had fallen from the old man with whom he had talked in the darknessrecurred to him. The Surveyor-General, in effect, endorsed the old man’s words.“We have abolished Cram,” he said, a phrase Graham was beginning to interpret asthe abolition of all sustained work. The Surveyor-General became sentimental.“We try and make the elementary schools very pleasant for the little children.They will have to work so soon. Just a few simpleprinciples—obedience—industry.”“You teach them very little?”“Why should we? It only leads to trouble and discontent. We amuse them. Even asit is—there are troubles—agitations. Where the labourers get the ideas, onecannot tell. They tell one another. There are socialistic dreams—anarchy even!Agitators will get to work among them. I take it—I have always taken it— that myforemost duty is to fight against popular discontent. Why should people be madeunhappy?”“I wonder,” said Graham thoughtfully. “But there are a great many things I wantto know.”Lincoln, who had stood watching Graham’s face throughout the conversation,intervened. “There are others,” he said in an undertone.The Surveyor-General of schools gesticulated himself away. “Perhaps,” saidLincoln, intercepting a casual glance, “you would like to know some of theseladies?”The daughter of the Manager of the Piggeries of the European Food Trust was aparticularly charming little person with red hair and animated blue eyes.Lincoln left him awhile to converse with her, and she displayed herself as quitean enthusiast for the “dear old times,” as she called them, that had seen thebeginning of his trance. As she talked she smiled, and her eyes smiled in amanner that demanded reciprocity.“I have tried,” she said, “countless times—to imagine those old romantic days.And to you—they are memories. How strange and crowded the world must seem toyou! I have seen photographs and pictures of the old times, the little isolatedhouses built of bricks made out of burnt mud and all black with soot from yourfires, the railway bridges, the simple advertisements, the solemn savagePuritanical men in strange black coats and those tall hats of theirs, ironrailway trains on iron bridges overhead, horses and cattle, and even dogsrunning half wild about the streets. And suddenly, you have come into this!”“Into this,” said Graham.“Out of your life—out of all that was familiar.”“The old life was not a happy one,” said Graham. “I do not regret that.”She looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause. She sighed encouragingly.“No?”“No,” said Graham. “It was a little life—and unmeaning. But this—. We thoughtthe world complex and crowded and civilised enough. Yet I see—although in thisworld I am barely four days old—looking back on my own time, that it was aqueer, barbaric time—the mere beginning of this new order. The mere beginning ofthis new order. You will find it hard to understand how little I know.”“You may ask me what you like,” she said, smiling at him.“Then tell me who these people are. I’m still very much in the dark about them.It’s puzzling. Are there any Generals?”“Men in hats and feathers?”“Of course not. No. I suppose they are the men who control the great publicbusinesses. Who is that distinguished looking man?”“That? He’s a most important officer. That is Morden. He is managing director ofthe Antibilious Pill Company. I have heard that his workers sometimes turn out amyriad myriad pills a day in the twenty-four hours. Fancy a myriad myriad!”“A myriad myriad. No wonder he looks proud,” said Graham. “Pills! What awonderful time it is! That man in purple?”“He is not quite one of the inner circle, you know. But we like him. He isreally clever and very amusing. He is one of the heads of the Medical Faculty ofour London University. All medical men, you know, are shareholders in theMedical Faculty Company, and wear that purple. You have to be—to be qualified.But of course, people who are paid by fees for doing something—” She smiled awaythe social pretensions of all such people.“Are any of your great artists or authors here?”“No authors. They are mostly such queer people—and so preoccupied aboutthemselves. And they quarrel so dreadfully! They will fight, some of them, forprecedence on staircases! Dreadful isn’t it? But I think Wraysbury, thefashionable capillotomist, is here. From Capri.”“Capillotomist,” said Graham. “Ah! I remember. An artist! Why not?”“We have to cultivate him,” she said apologetically. “Our heads are in hishands.” She smiled.Graham hesitated at the invited compliment, but his glance was expressive. “Havethe arts grown with the rest of civilised things?” he said. “Who are your greatpainters?”She looked at him doubtfully. Then laughed. “For a moment,” she said, “I thoughtyou meant—” She laughed again. “You mean, of course, those good men you used tothink so much of because they could cover great spaces of canvas with oilcolours? Great oblongs. And people used to put the things in gilt frames andhang them up in rows in their square rooms. We haven’t any. People grew tired ofthat sort of thing.”“But what did you think I meant?”She put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow was above suspicion, andsmiled and looked very arch and pretty and inviting. “And here,” and sheindicated her eyelid.Graham had an adventurous moment. Then a grotesque memory of a picture he hadsomewhere seen of Uncle Toby and the Widow flashed across his mind. An archaicshame came upon him. He became acutely aware that he was visible to a greatnumber of interested people. “I see,” he remarked inadequately. He turnedawkwardly away from her fascinating facility. He looked about him to meet anumber of eyes that immediately occupied themselves with other things. Possiblyhe coloured a little. “Who is that talking with the lady in saffron?” he asked,avoiding her eyes.The person in question he learnt was one of the great organisers of the Americantheatres just fresh from a gigantic production at Mexico. His face remindedGraham of a bust of Caligula. Another striking looking man was the Black LabourMaster. The phrase at the time made no deep impression, but afterwards itrecurred;—the Black Labour Master? The little lady, in no degree embarrassed,pointed out to him a charming little woman as one of the subsidiary wives of theAnglican Bishop of London. She added encomiums on the episcopal courage—hithertothere had been a rule of clerical monogamy—“neither a natural nor an expedientcondition of things. Why should the natural development of the affections bedwarfed and restricted because a man is a priest?”“And, bye the bye,” she added, “are you an Anglican?” Graham was on the verge ofhesitating inquiries about the status of a “subsidiary wife,” apparently aneuphemistic phrase, when Lincoln’s return broke off this very suggestive andinteresting conversation. They crossed the aisle to where a tall man in crimson,and two charming persons in Burmese costume (as it seemed to him) awaited himdiffidently. From their civilities he passed to other presentations.In a little while his multitudinous impressions began to organise themselvesinto a general effect. At first the glitter of the gathering had raised all thedemocrat in Graham; he had felt hostile and satirical. But it is not in humannature to resist an atmosphere of courteous regard. Soon the music, the light,the play of colours, the shining arms and shoulders about him, the touch ofhands, the transient interest of smiling faces, the frothing sound of skilfullymodulated voices, the atmosphere of compliment, interest and respect, had woventogether into a fabric of indisputable pleasure. Graham for a time forgot hisspacious resolutions. He gave way insensibly to the intoxication of the positionthat was conceded him, his manner became less conscious, more convincinglyregal, his feet walked assuredly, the black robe fell with a bolder fold andpride ennobled his voice. After all this was a brilliant interesting world.His glance went approvingly over the shifting colours of the people, it restedhere and there in kindly criticism upon a face. Presently it occurred to himthat he owed some apology to the charming little person with the red hair andblue eyes. He felt guilty of a clumsy snub. It was not princely to ignore heradvances, even if his policy necessitated their rejection. He wondered if heshould see her again. And suddenly a little thing touched all the glamour ofthis brilliant gathering and changed its quality.He looked up and saw passing across a bridge of porcelain and looking down uponhim, a face that was almost immediately hidden, the face of the girl he had seenovernight in the little room beyond the theatre after his escape from theCouncil. And she was looking with much the same expression of curiousexpectation, of uncertain intentness, upon his proceedings. For the moment hedid not remember when he had seen her, and then with recognition came a vaguememory of the stirring emotions of their first encounter. But the dancing web ofmelody about him kept the air of that great marching song from his memory.The lady to whom he was talking repeated her remark, and Graham recalled himselfto the quasi-regal flirtation upon which he was engaged.But from that moment a vague restlessness, a feeling that grew todissatisfaction, came into his mind. He was troubled as if by some halfforgotten duty, by the sense of things important slipping from him amidst thislight and brilliance. The attraction that these bright ladies who crowded abouthim were beginning to exercise ceased. He no longer made vague and clumsyresponses to the subtly amorous advances that he was now assured were being madeto him, and his eyes wandered for another sight of that face that had appealedso strongly to his sense of beauty. But he did not see her again until he wasawaiting Lincoln’s return to leave this assembly. In answer to his requestLincoln had promised that an attempt should be made to fly that afternoon, ifthe weather permitted. He had gone to make certain necessary arrangements.Graham was in one of the upper galleries in conversation with a bright-eyed ladyon the subject of Eadhamite—the subject was his choice and not hers. He hadinterrupted her warm assurances of personal devotion with a matter-of-factenquiry. He found her, as he had already found several other latter-day womenthat night, less well informed than charming. Suddenly, struggling against theeddying drift of nearer melody, the song of the Revolt, the great song he hadheard in the Hall, hoarse and massive, came beating down to him.He glanced up startled, and perceived above him an oeil de boeuf through whichthis song had come, and beyond, the upper courses of cable, the blue haze, andthe pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways. He heard the song breakinto a tumult of voices and cease. But now he perceived quite clearly the droneand tumult of the moving platforms and a murmur of many people. He had a vaguepersuasion that he could not account for, a sort of instinctive feeling thatoutside in the ways a huge crowd must be watching this place in which theirMaster amused himself. He wondered what they might be thinking.Though the song had stopped so abruptly, though the special music of thisgathering reasserted itself, the motif of the marching song, once it had begun,lingered in his mind.The bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the mysteries of Eadhamite whenhe perceived the girl he had seen in the theatre again. She was coming now alongthe gallery towards him; he saw her first before she saw him. She was dressed ina faintly luminous grey, her dark hair about her brows was like a cloud, and ashe saw her the cold light from the circular opening into the ways fell upon herdowncast face.The lady in trouble about the Eadhamite saw the change in his expression, andgrasped her opportunity to escape. “Would you care to know that girl, Sire?” sheasked boldly. “She is Helen Wotton—a niece of Ostrog’s. She knows a great manyserious things. She is one of the most serious persons alive. I am sure you willlike her.”In another moment Graham was talking to the girl, and the bright-eyed lady hadfluttered away.“I remember you quite well,” said Graham. “You were in that little room. Whenall the people were singing and beating time with their feet. Before I walkedacross the Hall.”Her momentary embarrassment passed. She looked up at him, and her face wassteady. “It was wonderful,” she said, hesitated, and spoke with a sudden effort.“All those people would have died for you, Sire. Countless people did die foryou that night.”Her face glowed. She glanced swiftly aside to see that no other heard her words.Lincoln appeared some way off along the gallery, making his way through thepress towards them. She saw him and turned to Graham strangely eager, with aswift change to confidence and intimacy. “Sire,” she said quickly, “I cannottell you now and here. But the common people are very unhappy; they areoppressed— they are misgoverned. Do not forget the people, who faced death—deaththat you might live.”“I know nothing—” began Graham.“I cannot tell you now.”Lincoln’s face appeared close to them. He bowed an apology to the girl.“You find the new world pleasant, Sire?” asked Lincoln, with smiling deference,and indicating the space and splendour of the gathering by one comprehensivegesture. “At any rate, you find it changed.”“Yes,” said Graham, “changed. And yet, after all, not so greatly changed.”“Wait till you are in the air,” said Lincoln. “The wind has fallen; even now anaëropile awaits you.”The girl’s attitude awaited dismissal.Graham glanced at her face, was on the verge of a question, found a warning inher expression, bowed to her and turned to accompany Lincoln."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16THE AËROPILEFor a while, as Graham went through the passages of the wind-vane offices withLincoln, he was preoccupied. But, by an effort, he attended to the things whichLincoln was saying. Soon his preoccupation vanished. Lincoln was talking offlying. Graham had a strong desire to know more of this new human attainment. Hebegan to ply Lincoln with questions. He had followed the crude beginnings ofaërial navigation very keenly in his previous life; he was delighted to find thefamiliar names of Maxim and Pilcher, Langley and Chanute, and, above all, of theaërial proto-martyr Lillienthal, still honoured by men.Even during his previous life two lines of investigation had pointed clearly totwo distinct types of contrivance as possible, and both of these had beenrealised. On the one hand was the great engine-driven aëroplane, a double row ofhorizontal floats with a big aërial screw behind, and on the other the nimbleraëropile. The aëroplanes flew safely only in a calm or moderate wind, and suddenstorms, occurrences that were now accurately predictable, rendered them for allpractical purposes useless. They were built of enormous size—the usual stretchof wing being six hundred feet or more, and the length of the fabric a thousandfeet. They were for passenger traffic alone. The lightly swung car they carriedwas from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in length. It was hung in apeculiar manner in order to minimise the complex vibration that even a moderatewind produced, and for the same reason the little seats within the car— eachpassenger remained seated during the voyage—were slung with great freedom ofmovement. The starting of the mechanism was only possible from a gigantic car onthe rail of a specially constructed stage. Graham had seen these vast stages,the flying stages, from the crow’s nest very well. Six huge blank areas theywere, with a giant “carrier” stage on each.The choice of descent was equally circumscribed, an accurately plane surfacebeing needed for safe grounding. Apart from the destruction that would have beencaused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and metal, and theimpossibility of its rising again, the concussion of an irregular surface, atree-set hillside, for instance, or an embankment, would be sufficient to pierceor damage the framework, to smash the ribs of the body, and perhaps kill thoseaboard.At first Graham felt disappointed with these cumbersome contrivances, but hespeedily grasped the fact that smaller machines would have been unremunerative,for the simple reason that their carrying power would be disproportionatelydiminished with diminished size. Moreover, the huge size of these things enabledthem—and it was a consideration of primary importance—to traverse the air atenormous speeds, and so run no risks of unanticipated weather. The briefestjourney performed, that from London to Paris, took about three-quarters of anhour, but the velocity attained was not high; the leap to New York occupiedabout two hours, and by timing oneself carefully at the intermediate stations itwas possible in quiet weather to go around the world in a day.The little aëropiles (as for no particular reason they were distinctivelycalled) were of an altogether different type. Several of these were going to andfro in the air. They were designed to carry only one or two persons, and theirmanufacture and maintenance was so costly as to render them the monopoly of thericher sort of people. Their sails, which were brilliantly coloured, consistedonly of two pairs of lateral air floats in the same plane, and of a screwbehind. Their small size rendered a descent in any open space neither difficultnor disagreeable, and it was possible to attach pneumatic wheels or even theordinary motors for terrestrial traffic to them, and so carry them to aconvenient starting place. They required a special sort of swift car to throwthem into the air, but such a car was efficient in any open place clear of highbuildings or trees. Human aëronautics, Graham perceived, were evidently still along way behind the instinctive gift of the albatross or the fly-catcher. Onegreat influence that might have brought the aëropile to a more rapid perfectionhad been withheld; these inventions had never been used in warfare. The lastgreat international struggle had occurred before the usurpation of the Council.The flying stages of London were collected together in an irregular crescent onthe southern side of the river. They formed three groups of two each andretained the names of ancient suburban hills or villages. They were named inorder, Roehampton, Wimbledon Park, Streatham, Norwood, Blackheath, and Shooter’sHill. They were uniform structures rising high above the general roof surfaces.Each was about four thousand yards long and a thousand broad, and constructed ofthe compound of aluminium and iron that had replaced iron in architecture. Theirhigher tiers formed an openwork of girders through which lifts and staircasesascended. The upper surface was a uniform expanse, with portions—the startingcarriers—that could be raised and were then able to run on very slightlyinclined rails to the end of the fabric. Save for any aëropiles or aëroplanesthat were in port these open surfaces were kept clear for arrivals.During the adjustment of the aëroplanes it was the custom for passengers to waitin the system of theatres, restaurants, news-rooms, and places of pleasure andindulgence of various sorts that interwove with the prosperous shops below. Thisportion of London was in consequence commonly the gayest of all its districts,with something of the meretricious gaiety of a seaport or city of hotels. Andfor those who took a more serious view of aëronautics, the religious quartershad flung out an attractive colony of devotional chapels, while a host ofbrilliant medical establishments competed to supply physical preparatives forthe journey. At various levels through the mass of chambers and passages beneaththese, ran, in addition to the main moving ways of the city which laced andgathered here, a complex system of special passages and lifts and slides, forthe convenient interchange of people and luggage between stage and stage. And adistinctive feature of the architecture of this section was the ostentatiousmassiveness of the metal piers and girders that everywhere broke the vistas andspanned the halls and passages, crowding and twining up to meet the weight ofthe stages and the weighty impact of the aëroplanes overhead.Graham went to the flying stages by the public ways. He was accompanied byAsano, his Japanese attendant. Lincoln was called away by Ostrog, who was busywith his administrative concerns. A strong guard of the wind-vane police awaitedthe Master outside the wind-vane offices, and they cleared a space for him onthe upper moving platform. His passage to the flying stages was unexpected,nevertheless a considerable crowd gathered and followed him to his destination.As he went along, he could hear the people shouting his name, and saw numberlessmen and women and children in blue come swarming up the staircases in thecentral path, gesticulating and shouting. He could not hear what they shouted.He was struck again by the evident existence of a vulgar dialect among the poorof the city. When at last he descended, his guards were immediately surroundedby a dense excited crowd. Afterwards it occurred to him that some had attemptedto reach him with petitions. His guards cleared a passage for him withdifficulty.He found an aëropile in charge of an aëronaut awaiting him on the westwardstage. Seen close this mechanism was no longer small. As it lay on its launchingcarrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage, its aluminium body skeletonwas as big as the hull of a twenty-ton yacht. Its lateral supporting sailsbraced and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of a bee’s wing, andmade of some sort of glassy artificial membrane, cast their shadow over manyhundreds of square yards. The chairs for the engineer and his passenger hungfree to swing by a complex tackle, within the protecting ribs of the frame andwell abaft the middle. The passenger’s chair was protected by a wind-guard andguarded about with metallic rods carrying air cushions. It could, if desired, becompletely closed in, but Graham was anxious for novel experiences, and desiredthat it should be left open. The aëronaut sat behind a glass that sheltered hisface. The passenger could secure himself firmly in his seat, and this was almostunavoidable on landing, or he could move along by means of a little rail and rodto a locker at the stem of the machine, where his personal luggage, his wrapsand restoratives were placed, and which also with the seats, served as amake-weight to the parts of the central engine that projected to the propellerat the stern.The engine was very simple in appearance. Asano, pointing out the parts of thisapparatus to him, told him that, like the gas-engine of Victorian days, it wasof the explosive type, burning a small drop of a substance called “fomile” ateach stroke. It consisted simply of reservoir and piston about the long flutedcrank of the propeller shaft. So much Graham saw of the machine.The flying stage about him was empty save for Asano and their suite ofattendants. Directed by the aëronaut he placed himself in his seat. He thendrank a mixture containing ergot— a dose, he learnt, invariably administered tothose about to fly, and designed to counteract the possible effect of diminishedair pressure upon the system. Having done so, he declared himself ready for thejourney. Asano took the empty glass from him, stepped through the bars of thehull, and stood below on the stage waving his hand. Suddenly he seemed to slidealong the stage to the right and vanish.The engine was beating, the propeller spinning, and for a second the stage andthe buildings beyond were gliding swiftly and horizontally past Graham’s eye;then these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He gripped the little rods oneither side of him instinctively. He felt himself moving upward, heard the airwhistle over the top of the wind screen. The propeller screw moved round withpowerful rhythmic impulses—one, two, three, pause; one, two, three—which theengineer controlled very delicately. The machine began a quivering vibrationthat continued throughout the flight, and the roof areas seemed running away tostarboard very quickly and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from the face ofthe engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking sideways, there wasnothing very startling in what he saw—a rapid funicular railway might have giventhe same sensations. He recognised the Council House and the Highgate Ridge. Andthen he looked straight down between his feet.For a moment physical terror possessed him, a passionate sense of insecurity. Heheld tight. For a second or so he could not lift his eyes. Some hundred feet ormore sheer below him was one of the big wind-vanes of south-west London, andbeyond it the southernmost flying stage crowded with little black dots. Thesethings seemed to be falling away from him. For a second he had an impulse topursue the earth. He set his teeth, he lifted his eyes by a muscular effort, andthe moment of panic passed.He remained for a space with his teeth set hard, his eyes staring into the sky.Throb, throb, throb—beat, went the engine; throb, throb, throb,—beat. He grippedhis bars tightly, glanced at the aëronaut, and saw a smile upon his sun-tannedface. He smiled in return—perhaps a little artificially. “A little strange atfirst,” he shouted before he recalled his dignity. But he dared not look downagain for some time. He stared over the aëronaut’s head to where a rim of vagueblue horizon crept up the sky. For a little while he could not banish thethought of possible accidents from his mind. Throb, throb, throb—beat; supposesome trivial screw went wrong in that supporting engine! Suppose—! He made agrim effort to dismiss all such suppositions. After a while they did at leastabandon the foreground of his thoughts. And up he went steadily, higher andhigher into the clear air.Once the mental shock of moving unsupported through the air was over, hissensations ceased to be unpleasant, became very speedily pleasurable. He hadbeen warned of air sickness. But he found the pulsating movement of the aëropileas it drove up the faint south-west breeze was very little in excess of thepitching of a boat head on to broad rollers in a moderate gale, and he wasconstitutionally a good sailor. And the keenness of the more rarefied air intowhich they ascended produced a sense of lightness and exhilaration. He looked upand saw the blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came cautiouslydown through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung inthe lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then going lower and lessapprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the wind-vane keeper’s crow’s nestshining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment. As his eye fellwith more confidence now, there came a blue line of hills, and then London,already to leeward, an intricate space of roofing. Its near edge came sharp andclear, and banished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For theboundary of London was like a wall, like a cliff, a steep fall of three or fourhundred feet, a frontage broken only by terraces here and there, a complexdecorative façade.That gradual passage of town into country through an extensive sponge ofsuburbs, which was so characteristic a feature of the great cities of thenineteenth century, existed no longer. Nothing remained of it but a waste ofruins here, variegated and dense with thickets of the heterogeneous growths thathad once adorned the gardens of the belt, interspersed among levelled brownpatches of sown ground, and verdant stretches of winter greens. The latter evenspread among the vestiges of houses. But for the most part the reefs andskerries of ruins, the wreckage of suburban villas, stood among their streetsand roads, queer islands amidst the levelled expanses of green and brown,abandoned indeed by the inhabitants years since, but too substantial, it seemed,to be cleared out of the way of the wholesale horticultural mechanisms of thetime.The vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed amidst the countless cells ofcrumbling house walls, and broke along the foot of the city wall in a surf ofbramble and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses. Here and there gaudypleasure palaces towered amidst the puny remains of Victorian times, and cableways slanted to them from the city. That winter day they seemed deserted.Deserted, too, were the artificial gardens among the ruins. The city limits wereindeed as sharply defined as in the ancient days when the gates were shut atnightfall and the robber foeman prowled to the very walls. A huge semi-circularthroat poured out a vigorous traffic upon the Eadhamite Bath Road. So the firstprospect of the world beyond the city flashed on Graham, and dwindled. And whenat last he could look vertically downward again, he saw below him the vegetablefields of the Thames valley—innumerable minute oblongs of ruddy brown,intersected by shining threads, the sewage ditches.His exhilaration increased rapidly, became a sort of intoxication. He foundhimself drawing deep breaths of air, laughing aloud, desiring to shout. After atime that desire became too strong for him, and he shouted.The machine had now risen as high as was customary with aëropiles, and theybegan to curve about towards the south. Steering, Graham perceived, was effectedby the opening or closing of one or two thin strips of membrane in one or otherof the otherwise rigid wings, and by the movement of the whole engine backwardor forward along its supports. The aëronaut set the engine gliding slowlyforward along its rail and opened the valve of the leeward wing until the stemof the aëropile was horizontal and pointing southward. And in that directionthey drove with a slight list to leeward, and with a slow alternation ofmovement, first a short, sharp ascent and then a long downward glide that wasvery swift and pleasing. During these downward glides the propellor was inactivealtogether. These ascents gave Graham a glorious sense of successful effort; thedescents through the rarefied air were beyond all experience. He wanted never toleave the upper air again.For a time he was intent upon the minute details of the landscape that ranswiftly northward beneath him. Its minute, clear detail pleased him exceedingly.He was impressed by the ruin of the houses that had once dotted the country, bythe vast treeless expanse of country from which all farms and villages had gone,save for crumbling ruins. He had known the thing was so, but seeing it so was analtogether different matter. He tried to make out places he had known within thehollow basin of the world below, but at first he could distinguish no data nowthat the Thames valley was left behind. Soon, however, they were driving over asharp chalk hill that he recognised as the Guildford Hog’s Back, because of thefamiliar outline of the gorge at its eastward end, and because of the ruins ofthe town that rose steeply on either lip of this gorge. And from that he madeout other points, Leith Hill, the sandy wastes of Aldershot, and so forth. TheDowns escarpment was set with gigantic slow-moving wind-wheels. Save where thebroad Eadhamite Portsmouth Road, thickly dotted with rushing shapes, followedthe course of the old railway, the gorge of the Wey was choked with thickets.The whole expanse of the Downs escarpment, so far as the grey haze permitted himto see, was set with wind-wheels to which the largest of the city was but ayounger brother. They stirred with a stately motion before the south-west wind.And here and there were patches dotted with the sheep of the British Food Trust,and here and there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black. Then rushing underthe stern of the aëropile came the Wealden Heights, the line of Hindhead, PitchHill, and Leith Hill, with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving torob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze. The purple heather wasspeckled with yellow gorse, and on the further side a drove of black oxenstampeded before a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept behind, anddwindled and lost colour, and became scarce moving specks that were swallowed upin haze.And when these had vanished in the distance Graham heard a peewit wailing closeat hand. He perceived he was now above the South Downs, and staring over hisshoulder saw the battlements of Portsmouth Landing Stage towering over the ridgeof Ports-down Hill. In another moment there came into sight a spread of shippinglike floating cities, the little white cliffs of the Needles dwarfed and sunlit,and the grey and glittering waters of the narrow sea. They seemed to leap theSolent in a moment, and in a few seconds the Isle of Wight was running past, andthen beneath him spread a wider and wider extent of sea, here purple with theshadow of a cloud, here grey, here a burnished mirror, and here a spread ofcloudy greenish blue. The Isle of Wight grew smaller and smaller. In a few moreminutes a strip of grey haze detached itself from other strips that were clouds,descended out of the sky and became a coastline—sunlit and pleasant—the coast ofnorthern France. It rose, it took colour, became definite and detailed, and thecounterpart of the Downland of England was speeding by below.In a little time, as it seemed, Paris came above the horizon, and hung there fora space, and sank out of sight again as the aëropile circled about to the northagain. But he perceived the Eiffel Tower still standing, and beside it a hugedome surmounted by a pinpoint Colossus. And he perceived, too, though he did notunderstand it at the time, a slanting drift of smoke. The aëronaut saidsomething about “trouble in the underways,” that Graham did not heed at thetime. But he marked the minarets and towers and slender masses that streamedskyward above the city wind-vanes, and knew that in the mattter of grace atleast Paris still kept in front of her larger rival. And even as he looked apale blue shape ascended very swiftly from the city like a dead leaf driving upbefore a gale. It curved round and soared towards them growing rapidly largerand larger. The aëronaut was saying something. “What?” said Graham, loth to takehis eyes from this. “Aëroplane, Sire,” bawled the aëronaut pointing.They rose and curved about northward as it drew nearer. Nearer it came andnearer, larger and larger. The throb, throb, throb—beat, of the aëropile’sflight, that had seemed so potent and so swift, suddenly appeared slow bycomparison with this tremendous rush. How great the monster seemed, how swiftand steady! It passed quite closely beneath them, driving along silently, a vastspread of wire-netted translucent wings, a thing alive. Graham had a momentaryglimpse of the rows and rows of wrapped-up passengers, slung in their littlecradles behind wind-screens, of a white-clothed engineer crawling against thegale along a ladder way, of spouting engines beating together, of the whirlingwind screw, and of a wide waste of wing. He exulted in the sight. And in aninstant the thing had passed.It rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the rush of its flight. Itfell and grew smaller. Scarcely had they moved, as it seemed, before it wasagain only a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky. This was the aëroplanethat went to and fro between London and Paris. In fair weather and in peacefultimes it came and went four times a day.They beat across the Channel, slowly as it seemed now, to Graham’s enlargedideas, and Beachy Head rose greyly to the left of them.“Land,” called the aëronaut, his voice small against the whistling of the airover the wind-screen.“Not yet,” bawled Graham, laughing. “Not land yet. I want to learn more of thismachine.”“I meant—” said the aëronaut.“I want to learn more of this machine,” repeated Graham.“I’m coming to you,” he said, and had flung himself free of his chair and takena step along the guarded rail between them. He stopped for a moment, and hiscolour changed and his hands tightened. Another step and he was clinging closeto the aëronaut. He felt a weight on his shoulder, the pressure of the air. Hishat was a whirling speck behind. The wind came in gusts over his wind-screen andblew his hair in streamers past his cheek. The aëronaut made some hastyadjustments for the shifting of the centres of gravity and pressure.“I want to have these things explained,” said Graham. “What do you do when youmove that engine forward?”The aëronaut hesitated. Then he answered, “They are complex, Sire.”“I don’t mind,” shouted Graham. “I don’t mind.”There was a moment’s pause. “Aëronautics is the secret—the privilege—”“I know. But I’m the Master, and I mean to know.” He laughed, full of this novelrealisation of power that was his gift from the upper air.The aëropile curved about, and the keen fresh wind cut across Graham’s face andhis garment lugged at his body as the stem pointed round to the west. The twomen looked into each other’s eyes.“Sire, there are rules—”“Not where I am concerned,” said Graham. “You seem to forget.”The aëronaut scrutinised his face. “No,” he said. “I do not forget, Sire. But inall the earth—no man who is not a sworn aëronaut—has ever a chance. They come aspassengers—”“I have heard something of the sort. But I’m not going to argue these points. Doyou know why I have slept two hundred years? To fly!”“Sire,” said the aëronaut, “the rules—if I break the rules—”Graham waved the penalties aside.“Then if you will watch me—”“No,” said Graham, swaying and gripping tight as the machine lifted its noseagain for an ascent. “That’s not my game. I want to do it myself. Do it myselfif I smash for it! No! I will. See. I am going to clamber by this—to come andshare your seat. Steady! I mean to fly of my own accord if I smash at the end ofit. I will have something to pay for my sleep. Of all other things—. In my pastit was my dream to fly. Now—keep your balance.”“A dozen spies are watching me, Sire!”Graham’s temper was at end. Perhaps he chose it should be. He swore. He swunghimself round the intervening mass of levers and the aëropile swayed.“Am I Master of the earth?” he said. “Or is your Society? Now. Take your handsoff those levers, and hold my wrists. Yes—so. And now, how do we turn her nosedown to the glide?”“Sire,” said the aëronaut.“What is it?”“You will protect me?”“Lord! Yes! If I have to burn London. Now!”And with that promise Graham bought his first lesson in aërial navigation. “It’sclearly to your advantage, this journey,” he said with a loud laugh—for the airwas like strong wine—“to teach me quickly and well. Do I pull this? Ah! So!Hullo!”“Back, Sire! Back!”“Back—right. One—two—three—good God! Ah! Up she goes! But this is living!”And now the machine began to dance the strangest figures in the air. Now itwould sweep round a spiral of scarcely a hundred yards diameter, now it wouldrush up into the air and swoop down again, steeply, swiftly, falling like ahawk, to recover in a rushing loop that swept it high again. In one of thesedescents it seemed driving straight at the drifting park of balloons in thesouth-east, and only curved about and cleared them by a sudden recovery ofdexterity. The extraordinary swiftness and smoothness of the motion, theextraordinary effect of the rarefied air upon his constitution, threw Grahaminto a careless fury.But at last a queer incident came to sober him, to send him flying down oncemore to the crowded life below with all its dark insoluble riddles. As heswooped, came a tap and something flying past, and a drop like a drop of rain.Then as he went on down he saw something like a white rag whirling down in hiswake. “What was that?” he asked. “I did not see.”The aëronaut glanced, and then clutched at the lever to recover, for they weresweeping down. When the aëropile was rising again he drew a deep breath andreplied. “That,” and he indicated the white thing still fluttering down, “was aswan.”“I never saw it,” said Graham.The aëronaut made no answer, and Graham saw little drops upon his forehead.They drove horizontally while Graham clambered back to the passenger’s place outof the lash of the wind. And then came a swift rush down, with the wind-screwwhirling to check their fall, and the flying stage growing broad and dark beforethem. The sun, sinking over the chalk hills in the west, fell with them, andleft the sky a blaze of gold.Soon men could be seen as little specks. He heard a noise coming up to meet him,a noise like the sound of waves upon a pebbly beach, and saw that the roofsabout the flying stage were dark with his people rejoicing over his safe return.A dark mass was crushed together under the stage, a darkness stippled withinnumerable faces, and quivering with the minute oscillation of waved whitehandkerchiefs and waving hands."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17THREE DAYSLincoln awaited Graham in an apartment beneath the flying stages. He seemedcurious to learn all that had happened, pleased to hear of the extraordinarydelight and interest which Graham took in flying. Graham was in a mood ofenthusiasm. “I must learn to fly,” he cried. “I must master that. I pity allpoor souls who have died without this opportunity. The sweet swift air! It isthe most wonderful experience in the world.”“You will find our new times full of wonderful experiences,” said Lincoln. “I donot know what you will care to do now. We have music that may seem novel.”“For the present,” said Graham, “flying holds me. Let me learn more of that.Your aëronaut was saying there is some trades union objection to one’slearning.”“There is, I believe,” said Lincoln. “But for you—! If you would like to occupyyourself with that, we can make you a sworn aëronaut tomorrow.”Graham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his sensations for a while.“And as for affairs,” he asked abruptly. “How are things going on?”Lincoln waved affairs aside. “Ostrog will tell you that tomorrow,” he said.“Everything is settling down. The Revolution accomplishes itself all over theworld. Friction is inevitable here and there, of course; but your rule isassured. You may rest secure with things in Ostrog’s hands.”“Would it be possible for me to be made a sworn aëronaut, as you call it,forthwith—before I sleep?” said Graham, pacing. “Then I could be at it the veryfirst thing tomorrow again. . . .“It would be possible,” said Lincoln thoughtfully. “Quite possible. Indeed, itshall be done.” He laughed. “I came prepared to suggest amusements, but you havefound one for yourself. I will telephone to the aëronautical offices from hereand we will return to your apartments in the Wind-Vane Control. By the time youhave dined the aëronauts will be able to come. You don’t think that after youhave dined, you might prefer—?” He paused.“Yes,” said Graham.“We had prepared a show of dancers—they have been brought from the Capritheatre.”“I hate ballets,” said Graham, shortly. “Always did. That other—. That’s notwhat I want to see. We had dancers in the old days. For the matter of that, theyhad them in ancient Egypt. But flying—”“True,” said Lincoln. “Though our dancers—”“They can afford to wait,” said Graham; “they can afford to wait. I know. I’mnot a Latin. There’s questions I want to ask some expert—about your machinery.I’m keen. I want no distractions.”“You have the world to choose from,” said Lincoln; “whatever you want is yours.”Asano appeared, and under the escort of a strong guard they returned through thecity streets to Graham’s apartments. Far larger crowds had assembled to witnesshis return than his departure had gathered, and the shouts and cheering of thesemasses of people sometimes drowned Lincoln’s answers to the endless questionsGraham’s aërial journey had suggested. At first Graham had acknowledged thecheering and cries of the crowd by bows and gestures, but Lincoln warned himthat such a recognition would be considered incorrect behaviour. Graham, alreadya little wearied by rhythmic civilities, ignored his subjects for the remainderof his public progress.Directly they arrived at his apartments Asano departed in search ofkinematographic renderings of machinery in motion, and Lincoln despatchedGraham’s commands for models of machines and small machines to illustrate thevarious mechanical advances of the last two centuries. The little group ofappliances for telegraphic communication attracted the Master so strongly thathis delightfully prepared dinner, served by a number of charmingly dexterousgirls, waited for a space. The habit of smoking had almost ceased from the faceof the earth, but when he expressed a wish for that indulgence, inquiries weremade and some excellent cigars were discovered in Florida, and sent to him bypneumatic despatch while the dinner was still in progress. Afterwards came theaëronauts, and a feast of ingenious wonders in the hands of a latter-dayengineer. For the time, at any rate, the neat dexterity of counting andnumbering machines, building machines, spinning engines, patent doorways,explosive motors, grain and water elevators, slaughter-house machines andharvesting appliances, was more fascinating to Graham than any bayadere. “Wewere savages,” was his refrain, “we were savages. We were in the stoneage—compared with this. . . . And what else have you?”There came also practical psychologists with some very interesting developmentsin the art of hypnotism. The names of Milne Bramwell, Fechner, Liebault, WilliamJames, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore a value now that would have astonishedtheir contemporaries. Several practical applications of psychology were now ingeneral use; it had largely superseded drugs, antiseptics and anaesthetics inmedicine; was employed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration. Areal enlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in thisdirection. The feats of “calculating boys,” the wonders, as Graham had been wontto regard them, of mesmerisers, were now within the range of anyone who couldafford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long ago the old examination methodsin education had been destroyed by these expedients. Instead of years of study,candidates had substituted a few weeks of trances, and during the trances expertcoaches had simply to repeat all the points necessary for adequate answering,adding a suggestion of the post hypnotic recollection of these points. Inprocess mathematics particularly, this aid had been of singular service, and itwas now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manualdexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations conducted underfinite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort that is, were now systematicallyrelieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion, and brought to anunexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of the labouring classes, so soonas they were of sufficient age to be hypnotised, were thus converted intobeautifully punctual and trustworthy machine minders, and released forthwithfrom the long, long thoughts of youth. Aëronautical pupils, who gave way togiddiness, could be relieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street werehypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind. If anyone desired toremember a name, a series of numbers, a song or a speech, it could be done bythis method, and conversely memories could be effaced, habits removed, anddesires eradicated—a sort of psychic surgery was, in fact, in general use.Indignities, humbling experiences, were thus forgotten, amorous widows wouldobliterate their previous husbands, angry lovers release themselves from theirslavery. To graft desires, however, was still impossible, and the facts ofthought transference were yet unsystematised. The psychologists illustratedtheir expositions with some astounding experiments in mnemonics made through theagency of a troupe of pale-faced children in blue.Graham, like most of the people of his former time, distrusted the hypnotist, orhe might then and there have eased his mind of many painful preoccupations. Butin spite of Lincoln’s assurances he held to the old theory that to be hypnotisedwas in some way the surrender of his personality, the abdication of his will. Atthe banquet of wonderful experiences that was beginning, he wanted very keenlyto remain absolutely himself.The next day, and another day, and yet another day passed in such interests asthese. Each day Graham spent many hours in the glorious entertainment of flying.On the third day he soared across middle France, and within sight of thesnow-clad Alps. These vigorous exercises gave him restful sleep, and each daysaw a great stride in his health from the spiritless anaemia of his firstawakening. And whenever he was not in the air, and awake, Lincoln was assiduousin the cause of his amusement; all that was novel and curious in contemporaryinvention was brought to him, until at last his appetite for novelty waswell-nigh glutted. One might fill a dozen inconsecutive volumes with the strangethings they exhibited. Each afternoon he held his court for an hour or so. Hespeedily found his interest in his contemporaries becoming personal andintimate. At first he had been alert chiefly for unfamiliarity and peculiarity;any foppishness in their dress, any discordance with his preconceptions ofnobility in their status and manners had jarred upon him, and it was remarkableto him how soon that strangeness and the faint hostility that arose from it,disappeared; how soon he came to appreciate the true perspective of hisposition, and see the old Victorian days remote and quaint. He found himselfparticularly amused by the red-haired daughter of the Manager of the EuropeanPiggeries. On the second day after dinner he made the acquaintance of alatter-day dancing girl, and found her an astonishing artist. And after that,more hypnotic wonders. On the third day Lincoln was moved to suggest that theMaster should repair to a Pleasure City, but this Graham declined, nor would heaccept the services of the hypnotists in his aëronautical experiments. The linkof locality held him to London; he found a perpetual wonder in topographicalidentifications that he would have missed abroad. “Here—or a hundred feet belowhere,” he could say, “I used to eat my midday cutlets during my LondonUniversity days. Underneath here was Waterloo and the perpetual hunt forconfusing trains. Often have I stood waiting down there, bag in hand, and staredup into the sky above the forest of signals, little thinking I should walk someday a hundred yards in the air. And now in that very sky that was once a greysmoke canopy, I circle in an aëropile.”During those three days Graham was so occupied with such distractions that thevast political movements in progress outside his quarters had but a small shareof his attention. Those about him told him little. Daily came Ostrog, the Boss,his Grand Vizier, his mayor of the palace, to report in vague terms the steadyestablishment of his rule; “a little trouble” soon to be settled in this city,“a slight disturbance” in that. The song of the social revolt came to him nomore; he never learned that it had been forbidden in the municipal limits; andall the great emotions of the crow’s nest slumbered in his mind.But on the second and third of the three days he found himself, in spite of hisinterest in the daughter of the Pig Manager, or it may be by reason of thethoughts her conversation suggested, remembering the girl Helen Wotton, who hadspoken to him so oddly at the wind-vane keeper’s gathering. The impression shehad made was a deep one, albeit the incessant surprise of novel circumstanceshad kept him from brooding upon it for a space. But now her memory was coming toits own. He wondered what she had meant by those broken half-forgottensentences; the picture of her eyes and the earnest passion of her face becamemore vivid as his mechanical interests faded. Her beauty came compellinglybetween him and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion. But he did notsee her again until three full days were past."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18GRAHAM REMEMBERSShe came upon him at last in a little gallery that ran from the wind vaneoffices toward his state apartments. The gallery was long and narrow, with aseries of recesses, each with an arched fenestration that looked upon a court ofpalms. He came upon her suddenly in one of these recesses. She was seated. Sheturned her head at the sound of his footsteps and started at the sight of him.Every touch of colour vanished from her face. She rose instantly, made a steptoward him as if to address him, and hesitated. He stopped and stood still,expectant. Then he perceived that a nervous tumult silenced her, perceived too,that she must have sought speech with him to be waiting for him in this place.He felt a regal impulse to assist her. “I have wanted to see you,” he said. “Afew days ago you wanted to tell me something— you wanted to tell me of thepeople. What was it you had to tell me?”She looked at him with troubled eyes.“You said the people were unhappy?”For a moment she was silent still.“It must have seemed strange to you,” she said abruptly.“It did. And yet—”“It was an impulse.”“Well?”“That is all.”She looked at him with a face of hesitation. She spoke with an effort. “Youforget,” she said, drawing a deep breath.“What?”“The people—”“Do you mean—?”“You forget the people.”He looked interrogative.“Yes. I know you are surprised. For you do not understand what you are. You donot know the things that are happening.”“Well?”“You do not understand.”“Not clearly, perhaps. But—tell me.”She turned to him with sudden resolution. “It is so hard to explain. I havemeant to, I have wanted to. And now—I cannot. I am not ready with words. Butabout you—there is something. It is Wonder. Your sleep—your awakening. Thesethings are miracles. To me at least—and to all the common people. You who livedand suffered and died, you who were a common citizen, wake again, live again, tofind yourself Master almost of the earth.”“Master of the earth,” he said. “So they tell me. But try and imagine how littleI know of it.”“Cities—Trusts—the Labour Company—”“Principalities, powers, dominions—the power and the glory. Yes, I have heardthem shout. I know. I am Master. King, if you wish. With Ostrog, the Boss—”He paused.She turned upon him and surveyed his face with a curious scrutiny. “Well?”He smiled. “To take the responsibility.”“That is what we have begun to fear.” For a moment she said no more. “No,” shesaid slowly. “You will take the responsibility. You will take theresponsibility. The people look to you.”She spoke softly. “Listen! For at least half the years of your sleep—in everygeneration—multitudes of people, in every generation greater multitudes ofpeople, have prayed that you might awake— prayed.”Graham moved to speak and did not.She hesitated, and a faint colour crept back to her cheek. “Do you know that youhave been to myriads—King Arthur, Barbarossa—the King who would come in his owngood time and put the world right for them?”“I suppose the imagination of the people—”“Have you not heard our proverb, ‘When the Sleeper wakes?’ While you layinsensible and motionless there—thousands came. Thousands. Every first of themonth you lay in state with a white robe upon you and the people filed by you.When I was a little girl I saw you like that, with your face white and calm.”She turned her face from him and looked steadfastly at the painted wall beforeher. Her voice fell. “When I was a little girl I used to look at your face. . .. It seemed to me fixed and waiting, like the patience of God.”“That is what we thought of you,” she said. “That is how you seemed to us.”She turned shining eyes to him, her voice was clear and strong. “In the city, inthe earth, a myriad myriad men and women are waiting to see what you will do,full of strange incredible expectations.”“Yes?”“Ostrog—no one—can take that responsibility.”Graham looked at her in surprise, at her face lit with emotion. She seemed atfirst to have spoken with an effort, and to have fired herself by speaking.“Do you think,” she said, “that you who have lived that little life so far awayin the past, you who have fallen into and risen out of this miracle of sleep—doyou think that the wonder and reverence and hope of half the world has gatheredabout you only that you may live another little life? . . . That you may shiftthe responsibility to any other man?”“I know how great this kingship of mine is,” he said haltingly. “I know howgreat it seems. But is it real? It is incredible— dreamlike. Is it real, or isit only a great delusion?”“It is real,” she said; “if you dare.”“After all, like all kingship, my kingship is Belief. It is an illusion in theminds of men.”“If you dare!” she said.“But—”“Countless men,” she said, “and while it is in their minds— they will obey.”“But I know nothing. That is what I had in mind. I know nothing. And theseothers—the Councillors, Ostrog. They are wiser, cooler, they know so much, everydetail. And, indeed, what are these miseries of which you speak? What am I toknow? Do you mean—”He stopped blankly.“I am still hardly more than a girl,” she said. “But to me the world seems fullof wretchedness. The world has altered since your day, altered very strangely. Ihave prayed that I might see you and tell you these things. The world haschanged. As if a canker had seized it—and robbed life of—everything worthhaving.”She turned a flushed face upon him, moving suddenly. “Your days were the days offreedom. Yes—I have thought. I have been made to think, for my life—has not beenhappy. Men are no longer free—no greater, no better than the men of your time.That is not all. This city—is a prison. Every city now is a prison. Mammon gripsthe key in his hand. Myriads, countless myriads, toil from the cradle to thegrave. Is that right? Is that to be—for ever? Yes, far worse than in your time.All about us, beneath us, sorrow and pain. All the shallow delight of such lifeas you find about you, is separated by just a little from a life of wretchednessbeyond any telling. Yes, the poor know it—they know they suffer. These countlessmultitudes who faced death for you two nights since—! You owe your life tothem.”“Yes,” said Graham, slowly. “Yes. I owe my life to them.”“You come,” she said, “from the days when this new tyranny of the cities wasscarcely beginning. It is a tyranny—a tyranny. In your days the feudal war lordshad gone, and the new lordship of wealth had still to come. Half the men in theworld still lived out upon the free countryside. The cities had still to devourthem. I have heard the stories out of the old books—there was nobility! Commonmen led lives of love and faithfulness then— they did a thousand things. Andyou—you come from that time.”“It was not—. But never mind. How is it now—?”“Gain and the Pleasure Cities! Or slavery—unthanked, un-honoured, slavery.”“Slavery!” he said.“Slavery.”“You don’t mean to say that human beings are chattels.”“Worse. That is what I want you to know, what I want you to see. I know you donot know. They will keep things from you, they will take you presently to aPleasure City. But you have noticed men and women and children in pale bluecanvas, with thin yellow faces and dull eyes?”“Everywhere.”“Speaking a horrible dialect, coarse and weak.”“I have heard it.”“They are the slaves—your slaves. They are the slaves of the Labour Company youown.”“The Labour Company! In some way—that is familiar. Ah! now I remember. I saw itwhen I was wandering about the city, after the lights returned, great fronts ofbuildings coloured pale blue. Do you really mean—?”“Yes. How can I explain it to you? Of course the blue uniform struck you. Nearlya third of our people wear it—more assume it now every day. This Labour Companyhas grown imperceptibly.”“What is this Labour Company?” asked Graham.“In the old times, how did you manage with starving people?”“There was the workhouse—which the parishes maintained.”“Workhouse! Yes—there was something. In our history lessons. I remember now. TheLabour Company ousted the workhouse. It grew—partly—out of something—you,perhaps, may remember it—an emotional religious organisation called theSalvation Army—that became a business company. In the first place it was almosta charity. To save people from workhouse rigours. Now I come to think of it, itwas one of the earliest properties your Trustees acquired. They bought theSalvation Army and reconstructed it as this. The idea in the first place was togive work to starving homeless people.”“Yes.”“Nowadays there are no workhouses, no refuges and charities, nothing but thatCompany. Its offices are everywhere. That blue is its colour. And any man, womanor child who comes to be hungry and weary and with neither home nor friend norresort, must go to the Company in the end—or seek some way of death. TheEuthanasy is beyond their means—for the poor there is no easy death. And at anyhour in the day or night there is food, shelter and a blue uniform for allcomers—that is the first condition of the Company’s incorporation—and in returnfor a day’s shelter the Company extracts a day’s work, and then returns thevisitor’s proper clothing and sends him or her out again.”“Yes?”“Perhaps that does not seem so terrible to you. In your days men starved in yourstreets. That was bad. But they died—men. These people in blue—. The proverbruns: ‘Blue canvas once and ever.’ The Company trades in their labour, and ithas taken care to assure itself of the supply. People come to it starving andhelpless—they eat and sleep for a night and day, they work for a day, and at theend of the day they go out again. If they have worked well they have a penny orso—enough for a theatre or a cheap dancing place, or a kinematograph story, or adinner or a bet. They wander about after that is spent. Begging is prevented bythe police of the ways. Besides, no one gives. They come back again the next dayor the day after—brought back by the same incapacity that brought them first. Atlast their proper clothing wears out, or their rags get so shabby that they areashamed. Then they must work for months to get fresh. If they want fresh. Agreat number of children are born under the Company’s care. The mother owes thema month thereafter— the children they cherish and educate until they arefourteen, and they pay two years’ service. You may be sure these children areeducated for the blue canvas. And so it is the Company works.”“And none are destitute in the city?”“None. They are either in blue canvas or in prison.”“If they will not work?”“Most people will work at that pitch, and the Company has powers. There arestages of unpleasantness in the work—stoppage of food—and a man or woman who hasrefused to work once is known by a thumb-marking system in the Company’s officesall over the world. Besides, who can leave the city poor? To go to Paris coststwo Lions. And for insubordination there are the prisons— dark and miserable—outof sight below. There are prisons now for many things.”“And a third of the people wear this blue canvas?”“More than a third. Toilers, living without pride or delight or hope, with thestories of Pleasure Cities ringing in their ears, mocking their shameful lives,their privations and hardships. Too poor even for the Euthanasy, the rich man’srefuge from life. Dumb, crippled millions, countless millions, all the worldabout, ignorant of anything but limitations and unsatisfied desires. They areborn, they are thwarted and they die. That is the state to which we have come.”For a space Graham sat downcast.“But there has been a revolution,” he said. “All these things will be changed.Ostrog—”“That is our hope. That is the hope of the world. But Ostrog will not do it. Heis a politician. To him it seems things must be like this. He does not mind. Hetakes it for granted. All the rich, all the influential, all who are happy, comeat last to take these miseries for granted. They use the people in theirpolitics, they live in ease by their degradation. But you—you who come from ahappier age—it is to you the people look. To you.”He looked at her face. Her eyes were bright with unshed tears. He felt a rush ofemotion. For a moment he forgot this city, he forgot the race, and all thosevague remote voices, in the immediate humanity of her beauty.“But what am I to do?” he said with his eyes upon her.“Rule,” she answered, bending towards him and speaking in a low tone. “Rule theworld as it has never been ruled, for the good and happiness of men. For youmight rule it—you could rule it.“The people are stirring. All over the world the people are stirring. It wantsbut a word—but a word from you—to bring them all together. Even the middle sortof people are restless— unhappy.“They are not telling you the things that are happening. The people will not goback to their drudgery—they refuse to be disarmed. Ostrog has awakened somethinggreater than he dreamt of—he has awakened hopes.”His heart was beating fast. He tried to seem judicial, to weigh considerations.“They only want their leader,” she said.“And then?”“You could do what you would;—the world is yours.”He sat, no longer regarding her. Presently he spoke. “The old dreams, and thething I have dreamt, liberty, happiness. Are they dreams? Could one man—oneman—?” His voice sank and ceased.“Not one man, but all men—give them only a leader to speak the desire of theirhearts.”He shook his head, and for a time there was silence.He looked up suddenly, and their eyes met. “I have not your faith,” he said. “Ihave not your youth. I am here with power that mocks me. No—let me speak. I wantto do—not right—I have not the strength for that—but something rather right thanwrong. It will bring no millennium, but I am resolved now that I will rule. Whatyou have said has awakened me. . . . You are right. Ostrog must know his place.And I will learn—. . . . One thing I promise you. This Labour slavery shallend.”“And you will rule?”“Yes. Provided—. There is one thing.”“Yes?”“That you will help me.”“I! —a girl!”“Yes. Does it not occur to you I am absolutely alone?”She started and for an instant her eyes had pity. “Need you ask whether I willhelp you?” she said.She stood before him, beautiful, worshipful, and her enthusiasm and thegreatness of their theme was like a great gulf fixed between them. To touch her,to clasp her hand, was a thing beyond hope. “Then I will rule indeed,” he saidslowly. “I will rule—” He paused. “With you.”There came a tense silence, and then the beating of a clock striking the hour.She made him no answer. Graham rose.“Even now,” he said, “Ostrog will be waiting.” He hesitated, facing her. “When Ihave asked him certain questions—. There is much I do not know. It may be, thatI will go to see with my own eyes the things of which you have spoken. And whenI return—?”“I shall know of your going and coming. I will wait for you here again.”He stood for a moment regarding her.“I knew,” she said, and stopped.He waited, but she said no more. They regarded one another steadfastly,questioningly, and then he turned from her towards the wind-vane office."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19OSTROG’S POINT OF VIEWGraham found Ostrog waiting to give a formal account of his day’s stewardship.On previous occasions he had passed over this ceremony as speedily as possible,in order to resume his aërial experiences, but now he began to ask quick shortquestions. He was very anxious to take up his empire forthwith. Ostrog broughtflattering reports of the development of affairs abroad. In Paris and Berlin,Graham perceived that he was saying, there had been trouble, not organisedresistance indeed, but insubordinate proceedings. “After all these years,” saidOstrog, when Graham pressed enquiries; “the Commune has lifted its head again.That is the real nature of the struggle, to be explicit.” But order had beenrestored in these cities. Graham, the more deliberately judicial for thestirring emotions he felt, asked if there had been any fighting. “A little,”said Ostrog. “In one quarter only. But the Senegalese division of our Africanagricultural police— the Consolidated African Companies have a very well drilledpolice—was ready, and so were the aëroplanes. We expected a little trouble inthe continental cities, and in America. But things are very quiet in America.They are satisfied with the overthrow of the Council. For the time.”“Why should you expect trouble?” asked Graham abruptly.“There is a lot of discontent—social discontent.”“The Labour Company?”“You are learning,” said Ostrog with a touch of surprise. “Yes. It is chieflythe discontent with the Labour Company. It was that discontent supplied themotive force of this overthrow—that and your awakening.”“Yes?”Ostrog smiled. He became explicit. “We had to stir up their discontent, we hadto revive the old ideals of universal happiness—all men equal—all men happy—noluxury that everyone may not share—ideas that have slumbered for two hundredyears. You know that? We had to revive these ideals, impossible as they are—inorder to overthrow the Council. And now—”“Well?”“Our revolution is accomplished, and the Council is overthrown, and people whomwe have stirred up—remain surging. There was scarcely enough fighting. . . . Wemade promises, of course. It is extraordinary how violently and rapidly thisvague out-of-date humanitarianism has revived and spread. We who sowed the seedeven, have been astonished. In Paris, as I say—we have had to call in a littleexternal help.”“And here?”“There is trouble. Multitudes will not go back to work. There is a generalstrike. Half the factories are empty and the people are swarming in the ways.They are talking of a Commune. Men in silk and satin have been insulted in thestreets. The blue canvas is expecting all sorts of things from you. . . . Ofcourse there is no need for you to trouble. We are setting the Babble Machinesto work with counter suggestions in the cause of law and order. We must keep thegrip tight; that is all.”Graham thought. He perceived a way of asserting himself. But he spoke withrestraint.“Even to the pitch of bringing a negro police,” he said.“They are useful,” said Ostrog. “They are fine loyal brutes, with no wash ofideas in their heads—such as our rabble has. The Council should have had them aspolice of the ways, and things might have been different. Of course, there isnothing to fear except rioting and wreckage. You can manage your own wings now,and you can soar away to Capri if there is any smoke or fuss. We have the pullof all the great things; the aëronauts are privileged and rich, the closesttrades union in the world, and so are the engineers of the wind vanes. We havethe air, and the mastery of the air is the mastery of the earth. No one of anyability is organising against us. They have no leaders—only the sectionalleaders of the secret society we organised before your very opportune awakening.Mere busybodies and sentimentalists they are and bitterly jealous of each other.None of them is man enough for a central figure. The only touble will be adisorganised upheaval. To be frank—that may happen. But it won’t interrupt youraëronautics. The days when the People could make revolutions are past.”“I suppose they are,” said Graham. “I suppose they are.” He mused. “This worldof yours has been full of surprises to me. In the old days we dreamt of awonderful democratic life, of a time when all men would be equal and happy.”Ostrog looked at him steadfastly. “The day of democracy is past,” he said. “Pastfor ever. That day began with the bowmen of Creçy, it ended when marchinginfantry, when common men in masses ceased to win the battles of the world, whencostly cannon, great ironclads, and strategic railways became the means ofpower. To-day is the day of wealth. Wealth now is power as it never was powerbefore—it commands earth and sea and sky. All power is for those who can handlewealth. . . . You must accept facts, and these are facts. The world for theCrowd! The Crowd as Ruler! Even in your days that creed had been tried andcondemned. To-day it has only one believer—a multiplex, silly one—the man in theCrowd.”Graham did not answer immediately. He stood lost in sombre preoccupations.“No,” said Ostrog. “The day of the common man is past. On the open countrysideone man is as good as another, or nearly as good. The earlier aristocracy had aprecarious tenure of strength and audacity. They were tempered—tempered. Therewere insurrections, duels, riots. The first real aristocracy, the firstpermanent aristocracy, came in with castles and armour, and vanished before themusket and bow. But this is the second aristocracy. The real one. Those days ofgunpowder and democracy were only an eddy in the stream. The common man now is ahelpless unit. In these days we have this great machine of the city, and anorganisation complex beyond his understanding.”“Yet,” said Graham, “there is something resists, something you are holdingdown—something that stirs and presses.”“You will see,” said Ostrog, with a forced smile that would brush thesedifficult questions aside. “I have not roused the force to destroy myself—trustme.”“I wonder,” said Graham.Ostrog stared.“Must the world go this way?” said Graham, with his emotions at the speakingpoint. “Must it indeed go in this way? Have all our hopes been vain?”“What do you mean?” said Ostrog. “Hopes?”“I came from a democratic age. And I find an aristocratic tyranny!”“Well,—but you are the chief tyrant.”Graham shook his head.“Well,” said Ostrog, “take the general question. It is the way that change hasalways travelled. Aristocracy, the prevalence of the best—the suffering andextinction of the unfit, and so to better things.”“But aristocracy! those people I met—”“Oh! not those! ” said Ostrog. “But for the most part they go to their death.Vice and pleasure! They have no children. That sort of stuff will die out. Ifthe world keeps to one road, that is, if there is no turning back. An easy roadto excess, convenient Euthanasia for the pleasure seekers singed in the flame,that is the way to improve the race!”“Pleasant extinction,” said Graham. “Yet—.” He thought for an instant. “There isthat other thing—the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will that die out? Thatwill not die out. And it suffers, its suffering is a force that even you—”Ostrog moved impatiently, and when he spoke, he spoke rather less evenly thanbefore.“Don’t you trouble about these things,” he said. “Everything will be settled ina few days now. The Crowd is a huge foolish beast. What if it does not die out?Even if it does not die, it can still be tamed and driven. I have no sympathywith servile men. You heard those people shouting and singing two nights ago.They were taught that song. If you had taken any man there in cold blood andasked why he shouted, he could not have told you. They think they are shoutingfor you, that they are loyal and devoted to you. Just then they were ready toslaughter the Council. To-day—they are already murmuring against those who haveoverthrown the Council.”“No, no,” said Graham. “They shouted because their lives were dreary, withoutjoy or pride, and because in me—in me— they hoped.”“And what was their hope? What is their hope? What right have they to hope? Theywork ill and they want the reward of those who work well. The hope ofmankind—what is it? That some day the Over-man may come, that some day theinferior, the weak and the bestial may be subdued or eliminated. Subdued if noteliminated. The world is no place for the bad, the stupid, the enervated. Theirduty—it’s a fine duty too!—is to die. The death of the failure! That is the pathby which the beast rose to manhood, by which man goes on to higher things.”Ostrog took a pace, seemed to think, and turned on Graham. “I can imagine howthis great world state of ours seems to a Victorian Englishman. You regret allthe old forms of representative government—their spectres still haunt the world,the voting councils and parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery.You feel moved against our Pleasure Cities. I might have thought of that,—had Inot been busy. But you will learn better. The people are mad with envy—theywould be in sympathy with you. Even in the streets now, they clamour to destroythe Pleasure Cities. But the Pleasure Cities are the excretory organs of theState, attractive places that year after year draw together all that is weak andvicious, all that is lascivious and lazy, all the easy roguery of the world, toa graceful destruction. They go there, they have their time, they die childless,all the pretty silly lascivious women die childless, and mankind is the better.If the people were sane they would not envy the rich their way of death. And youwould emancipate the silly brainless workers that we have enslaved, and try tomake their lives easy and pleasant again. Just as they have sunk to what theyare fit for.” He smiled a smile that irritated Graham oddly. “You will learnbetter. I know those ideas; in my boyhood I read your Shelley and dreamt ofLiberty. There is no liberty, save wisdom and self-control. Liberty iswithin—not without. It is each man’s own affair. Suppose—which isimpossible—that these swarming yelping fools in blue get the upper hand of us,what then? They will only fall to other masters. So long as there are sheepNature will insist on beasts of prey. It would mean but a few hundred years’delay. The coming of the aristocrat is fatal and assured. The end will be theOver-man—for all the mad protests of humanity. Let them revolt, let them win andkill me and my like. Others will arise—other masters. The end will be the same.”“I wonder,” said Graham doggedly.For a moment he stood downcast.“But I must see these things for myself,” he said, suddenly assuming a tone ofconfident mastery. “Only by seeing can I understand. I must learn. That is whatI want to tell you, Ostrog. I do not want to be King in a Pleasure City; that isnot my pleasure. I have spent enough time with aëronautics—and those otherthings. I must learn how people live now, how the common life has developed.Then I shall understand these things better. I must learn how common peoplelive—the labour people more especially—how they work, marry, bear children,die—”“You get that from our realistic novelists,” suggested Ostrog, suddenlypreoccupied.“I want reality,” said Graham, “not realism.”“There are difficulties,” said Ostrog, and thought. “On the whole perhaps—“I did not expect—.“I had thought—. And yet, perhaps—. You say you want to go through the ways ofthe city and see the common people.”Suddenly he came to some conclusion. “You would need to go disguised,” he said.“The city is intensely excited, and the discovery of your presence among themmight create a fearful tumult. Still this wish of yours to go into thiscity—this idea of yours—. Yes, now I think the thing over it seems to me notaltogether—. It can be contrived. If you would really find an interest in that!You are, of course, Master. You can go soon if you like. A disguise for thisexcursion Asano will be able to manage. He would go with you. After all it isnot a bad idea of yours.”“You will not want to consult me in any matter?” asked Graham suddenly, struckby an odd suspicion.“Oh, dear no! No! I think you may trust affairs to me for a time, at any rate,”said Ostrog, smiling. “Even if we differ—”Graham glanced at him sharply.“There is no fighting likely to happen soon?” he asked abruptly.“Certainly not.”“I have been thinking about these negroes. I don’t believe the people intend anyhostility to me, and, after all, I am the Master. I do not want any negroesbrought to London. It is an archaic prejudice perhaps, but I have peculiarfeelings about Europeans and the subject races. Even about Paris—”Ostrog stood watching him from under his drooping brows. “I am not bringingnegroes to London,” he said slowly. “But if—”“You are not to bring armed negroes to London, whatever happens,” said Graham.“In that matter I am quite decided.”Ostrog, after a pause, decided not to speak, and bowed deferentially."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20IN THE CITY WAYSAnd that night, unknown and unsuspected, Graham, dressed in the costume of aninferior wind-vane official keeping holiday, and accompanied by Asano in LabourCompany canvas, surveyed the city through which he had wandered when it wasveiled in darkness. But now he saw it lit and waking, a whirlpool of life. Inspite of the surging and swaying of the forces of revolution, in spite of theunusual discontent, the mutterings of the greater struggle of which the firstrevolt was but the prelude, the myriad streams of commerce still flowed wide andstrong. He knew now something of the dimensions and quality of the new age, buthe was not prepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed view, for thetorrent of colour and vivid impressions that poured past him.This was his first real contact with the people of these latter days. Herealised that all that had gone before, saving his glimpses of the publictheatres and markets, had had its element of seclusion, had been a movementwithin the comparatively narrow political quarter, that all his previousexperiences had revolved immediately about the question of his own position. Buthere was the city at the busiest hours of night, the people to a large extentreturned to their own immediate interests, the resumption of the real informallife, the common habits of the new time.They emerged at first into a street whose opposite ways were crowded with theblue canvas liveries. This swarm Graham saw was a portion of a procession—it wasodd to see a procession parading the city seated. They carried banners of coarsered stuff with red letters. “No disarmament,” said the banners, for the mostpart in crudely daubed letters and with variant spelling, and “Why should wedisarm?” “No disarming.” “No disarming.” Banner after banner went by, a streamof banners flowing past, and at last at the end, the song of the revolt and anoisy band of strange instruments. “They all ought to be at work,” said Asano.“They have had no food these two days, or they have stolen it.”Presently Asano made a detour to avoid the congested crowd that gaped upon theoccasional passage of dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary, the gleaningsafter death’s harvest of the first revolt.That night few people were sleeping, everyone was abroad. A vast excitement,perpetual crowds perpetually changing, surrounded Graham; his mind was confusedand darkened by an incessant tumult, by the cries and enigmatical fragments ofthe social struggle that was as yet only beginning. Everywhere festoons andbanners of black and strange decorations, intensified the quality of hispopularity. Everywhere he caught snatches of that crude thick dialect thatserved the illiterate class, the class, that is, beyond the reach of phonographculture, in their common-place intercourse. Everywhere this trouble ofdisarmament was in the air, with a quality of immediate stress of which he hadno inkling during his seclusion in the wind-vane quarter. He perceived that assoon as he returned he must discuss this with Ostrog, this and the greaterissues of which it was the expression, in a far more conclusive way than he hadso far done. Perpetually that night, even in the earlier hours of theirwanderings about the city, the spirit of unrest and revolt swamped hisattention, to the exclusion of countless strange things he might otherwise haveobserved.This preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary. Yet amidst so much that wasstrange and vivid, no subject, however personal and insistent, could exertundivided sway. There were spaces when the revolutionary movement passed cleanout of his mind, was drawn aside like a curtain from before some startling newaspect of the time. Helen had swayed his mind to this intense earnestness ofenquiry, but there came times when she, even, receded beyond his consciousthoughts. At one moment, for example, he found they were traversing thereligious quarter, for the easy transit about the city afforded by the movingways rendered sporadic churches and chapels no longer necessary—and hisattention was vividly arrested by the façade of one of the Christian sects.They were travelling seated on one of the swift upper ways, the place leapt uponthem at a bend and advanced rapidly towards them. It was covered withinscriptions from top to base, in vivid white and blue, save where a vast andglaring kinematograph transparency presented a realistic New Testament scene,and where a vast festoon of black to show that the popular religion followed thepopular politics, hung across the lettering. Graham had already become familiarwith the phonotype writing and these inscriptions arrested him, being to hissense for the most part almost incredible blasphemy. Among the less offensivewere “Salvation on the First Floor and turn to the Right.” “Put your Money onyour Maker.” “The Sharpest Conversion in London, Expert Operators! Look Slippy!”“What Christ would say to the Sleeper;—Join the Up-to-date Saints!” “Be aChristian— without hindrance to your present Occupation.” “All the BrightestBishops on the Bench to-night and Prices as Usual.” “Brisk Blessings for BusyBusiness Men.”“But this is appalling!” said Graham, as that deafening scream of mercantilepiety towered above them.“What is appalling?” asked his little officer, apparently seeking vainly foranything unusual in this shrieking enamel.“This! Surely the essence of religion is reverence.”“Oh that! ” Asano looked at Graham. “Does it shock you?” he said in the tone ofone who makes a discovery. “I suppose it would, of course. I had forgotten.Nowadays the competition for attention is so keen, and people simply haven’t theleisure to attend to their souls, you know, as they used to do.” He smiled. “Inthe old days you had quiet Sabbaths and the countryside. Though somewhere I’veread of Sunday afternoons that—”“But, that,” said Graham, glancing back at the receding blue and white. “That issurely not the only—”“There are hundreds of different ways. But, of course, if a sect doesn’t tell itdoesn’t pay. Worship has moved with the times. There are high class sects withquieter ways—costly incense and personal attentions and all that. These peopleare extremely popular and prosperous. They pay several dozen lions for thoseapartments to the Council—to you, I should say.”Graham still felt a difficulty with the coinage, and this mention of a dozenlions brought him abruptly to that matter. In a moment the screaming temples andtheir swarming touts were forgotten in this new interest. A turn of a phrasesuggested, and an answer confirmed the idea that gold and silver were bothdemonetised, that stamped gold which had begun its reign amidst the merchants ofPhoenicia was at last dethroned. The change had been graduated but swift,brought about by an extension of the system of cheques that had even in hisprevious life already practically superseded gold in all the larger businesstransactions. The common traffic of the city, the common currency indeed of allthe world, was conducted by means of the little brown, green and pink, Councilcheques for small amounts, printed with a blank payee. Asano had several withhim, and at the first opportunity he supplied the gaps in his set. They wereprinted not on tearable paper, but on a semi-transparent fabric of silkenflexibility, interwoven with silk. Across them all sprawled a fac-simile ofGraham’s signature, his first encounter with the curves and turns of thatfamiliar autograph for two hundred and three years.Some intermediary experiences made no impression sufficiently vivid to preventthe matter of the disarmament claiming his thoughts again; a blurred picture ofa Theosophist temple that promised MIRACLES in enormous letters of unsteady firewas least submerged perhaps, but then came the view of the dining hall inNorthumberland Avenue. That interested him very greatly.By the energy and thought of Asano he was able to view this place from a littlescreened gallery reserved for the attendants of the tables. The building waspervaded by a distant muffled hooting, piping and bawling, of which he did notat first understand the import, but which recalled a certain mysterious leatheryvoice he had heard after the resumption of the lights on the night of hissolitary wandering.He had grown accustomed now to vastness and great numbers of people,nevertheless this spectacle held him for a long time. It was as he watched thetable service more immediately beneath, and interspersed with many questions andanswers concerning details, that the realisation of the full significance of thefeast of several thousand people came to him.It was his constant surprise to find that points that one might have expected tostrike vividly at the very outset never occurred to him until some trivialdetail suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the obvious thing he hadoverlooked. In this matter, for instance, it had not occurred to him that thiscontinuity of the city, this exclusion of weather, these vast halls and ways,involved the disappearance of the household; that the typical Victorian “Home,”the little brick cell containing kitchen and scullery, living rooms andbedrooms, had, save for the ruins that diversified the countryside, vanished assurely as the wattle hut. But now he saw what had indeed been manifest from thefirst, that London, regarded as a living place, was no longer an aggregation ofhouses but a prodigious hotel, an hotel with a thousand classes ofaccommodation, thousands of dining halls, chapels, theatres, markets and placesof assembly, a synthesis of enterprises, of which he chiefly was the owner.People had their sleeping rooms, with, it might be, antechambers, rooms thatwere always sanitary at least whatever the degree of comfort and privacy, andfor the rest they lived much as many people had lived in the new-made gianthotels of the Victorian days, eating, reading, thinking, playing, conversing,all in places of public resort, going to their work in the industrial quartersof the city or doing business in their offices in the trading section.He perceived at once how necessarily this state of affairs had developed fromthe Victorian city. The fundamental reason for the modern city had ever been theeconomy of co-operation. The chief thing to prevent the merging of the separatehouseholds in his own generation was simply the still imperfect civilisation ofthe people, the strong barbaric pride, passions, and prejudices, the jealousies,rivalries, and violence of the middle and lower classes, which had necessitatedthe entire separation of contiguous households. But the change, the taming ofthe people, had been in rapid progress even then. In his brief thirty years ofprevious life he had seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming mealsfrom home, the casually patronised horse-box coffee-house had given place to theopen and crowded Aërated Bread Shop for instance, women’s clubs had had theirbeginning, and an immense development of reading rooms, lounges and librarieshad witnessed to the growth of social confidence. These promises had by thistime attained to their complete fulfilment. The locked and barred household hadpassed away.These people below him belonged, he learnt, to the lower middle class, the classjust above the blue labourers, a class so accustomed in the Victorian period tofeed with every precaution of privacy that its members, when occasion confrontedthem with a public meal, would usually hide their embarrassment under horseplayor a markedly militant demeanour. But these gaily, if lightly dressed peoplebelow, albeit vivacious, hurried and uncommunicative, were dexterously manneredand certainly quite at their ease with regard to one another.He noted a slight significant thing; the table, as far as he could see, was andremained delightfully neat, there was nothing to parallel the confusion, thebroadcast crumbs, the splashes of viand and condiment, the overturned drink anddisplaced ornaments, which would have marked the stormy progress of theVictorian meal. The table furniture was very different. There were no ornaments,no flowers, and the table was without a cloth, being made, he learnt, of a solidsubstance having the texture and appearance of damask. He discerned that thisdamask substance was patterned with gracefully designed trade advertisements.In a sort of recess before each diner was a complex apparatus of porcelain andmetal. There was one plate of white porcelain, and by means of taps for hot andcold volatile fluids the diner washed this himself between the courses; he alsowashed his elegant white metal knife and fork and spoon as occasion required.Soup and the chemical wine that was the common drink were delivered by similartaps, and the remaining covers travelled automatically in tastefully arrangeddishes down the table along silver rails. The diner stopped these and helpedhimself at his discretion. They appeared at a little door at one end of thetable, and vanished at the other. That turn of democratic sentiment in decay,that ugly pride of menial souls, which renders equals loth to wait on oneanother, was very strong he found among these people. He was so preoccupied withthese details that it was only just as he was leaving the place that he remarkedthe huge advertisement dioramas that marched majestically along the upper wallsand proclaimed the most remarkable commodities.Beyond this place they came into a crowded hall, and he discovered the cause ofthe noise that had perplexed him. They paused at a turnstile at which a paymentwas made.Graham’s attention was immediately arrested by a violent, loud hoot, followed bya vast leathery voice. “The Master is sleeping peacefully,” it vociferated. “Heis in excellent health. He is going to devote the rest of his life toaëronautics. He says women are more beautiful than ever. Galloop! Wow! Ourwonderful civilisation astonishes him beyond measure. Beyond all measure.Galloop. He puts great trust in Boss Ostrog, absolute confidence in Boss Ostrog.Ostrog is to be his chief minister; is authorised to remove or reinstate publicofficers—all patronage will be in his hands. All patronage in the hands of BossOstrog! The Councillors have been sent back to their own prison above theCouncil House.”Graham stopped at the first sentence, and, looking up, beheld a foolish trumpetface from which this was brayed. This was the General Intelligence Machine. Fora space it seemed to be gathering breath, and a regular throbbing from itscylindrical body was audible. Then it trumpeted “Galloop, Galloop,” and brokeout again.“Paris is now pacified. All resistance is over. Galloop! The Black Police holdevery position of importance in the city. They fought with great bravery,singing songs written in praise of their ancestors by the poet Kipling. Once ortwice they got out of hand, and tortured and mutilated wounded and capturedinsurgents, men and women. Moral—don’t go rebelling. Haha! Galloop, Galloop!They are lively fellows. Lively brave fellows. Let this be a lesson to thedisorderly banderlog of this city. Yah! Banderlog! Filth of the earth! Galloop,Galloop!”The voice ceased. There was a confused murmur of disapproval among the crowd.“Damned niggers.” A man began to harangue near them. “Is this the Master’sdoing, brothers? Is this the Master’s doing?”“Black police!” said Graham. “What is that? You don’t mean—”Asano touched his arm and gave him a warning look, and forthwith another ofthese mechanisms screamed deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill voice.“Yahaha, Yahah, Yap! Hear a live paper yelp! Live paper. Yaha! Shocking outragein Paris. Yahahah! The Parisians exasperated by the black police to the pitch ofassassination. Dreadful reprisals. Savage times come again. Blood! Blood! Yaha!”The nearer Babble Machine hooted stupendously, “Galloop, Galloop,” drowned theend of the sentence, and proceeded in a rather flatter note than before withnovel comments on the horrors of disorder. “Law and order must be maintained,”said the nearer Babble Machine.“But,” began Graham.“Don’t ask questions here,” said Asano, “or you will be involved in anargument.”“Then let us go on,” said Graham, “for I want to know more of this.”As he and his companion pushed their way through the excited crowd that swarmedbeneath these voices, towards the exit, Graham conceived more clearly theproportion and features of this room. Altogether, great and small, there musthave been nearly a thousand of these erections, piping, hooting, bawling andgabbling in that great space, each with its crowd of excited listeners, themajority of them men dressed in blue canvas. There were all sizes of machines,from the little gossipping mechanisms that chuckled out mechanical sarcasm inodd corners, through a number of grades to such fifty-foot giants as that whichhad first hooted over Graham.This place was unusually crowded, because of the intense public interest in thecourse of affairs in Paris. Evidently the struggle had been much more savagethan Ostrog had represented it. All the mechanisms were discoursing upon thattopic, and the repetition of the people made the huge hive buzz with suchphrases as “Lynched policemen,” “Women burnt alive,” “Fuzzy Wuzzy.” “But doesthe Master allow such things?” asked a man near him. “Is this the beginning ofthe Master’s rule?”Is this the beginning of the Master’s rule? For a long time after he had leftthe place, the hooting, whistling and braying of the machines pursued him;“Galloop, Galloop,” “Yahahah, Yaha, Yap! Yaha!” Is this the beginning of theMaster’s rule?Directly they were out upon the ways he began to question Asano closely on thenature of the Parisian struggle. “This disarmament! What was their trouble? Whatdoes it all mean?” Asano seemed chiefly anxious to reassure him that it was “allright.” “But these outrages!” “You cannot have an omelette,” said Asano,“without breaking eggs. It is only the rough people. Only in one part of thecity. All the rest is all right. The Parisian labourers are the wildest in theworld, except ours.”“What! the Londoners?”“No, the Japanese. They have to be kept in order.”“But burning women alive!”“A Commune!” said Asano. “They would rob you of your property. They would doaway with property and give the world over to mob rule. You are Master, theworld is yours. But there will be no Commune here. There is no need for blackpolice here.“And every consideration has been shown. It is their own negroes—French speakingnegroes. Senegal regiments, and Niger and Timbuctoo.”“Regiments?” said Graham, “I thought there was only one—.”“No,” said Asano, and glanced at him. “There is more than one.”Graham felt unpleasantly helpless.“I did not think,” he began and stopped abruptly. He went off at a tangent toask for information about these Babble Machines. For the most part, the crowdpresent had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed, and Graham learnt that sofar as the more prosperous classes were concerned, in all the more comfortableprivate apartments of the city were fixed Babble Machines that would speakdirectly a lever was pulled. The tenant of the apartment could connect this withthe cables of any of the great News Syndicates that he preferred. When he learntthis presently, he demanded the reason of their absence from his own suite ofapartments. Asano stared. “I never thought,” he said. “Ostrog must have had themremoved.”Graham stared. “How was I to know?” he exclaimed.“Perhaps he thought they would annoy you,” said Asano.“They must be replaced directly I return,” said Graham after an interval.He found a difficulty in understanding that this news room and the dining hallwere not great central places, that such establishments were repeated almostbeyond counting all over the city. But ever and again during the night’sexpedition his ears, in some new quarter, would pick out from the tumult of theways the peculiar hooting of the organ of Boss Ostrog, “Galloop, Galloop!” orthe shrill “Yahaha, Yaha, Yap!—Hear a live paper yelp!” of its chief rival.Repeated, too, everywhere, were such crèches as the one he now entered. It wasreached by a lift, and by a glass bridge that flung across the dining hall andtraversed the ways at a slight upward angle. To enter the first section of theplace necessitated the use of his solvent signature under Asano’s direction.They were immediately attended to by a man in a violet robe and gold clasp, theinsignia of practising medical men. He perceived from this man’s manner that hisidentity was known, and proceeded to ask questions on the strange arrangementsof the place without reserve.On either side of the passage, which was silent and padded, as if to deaden thefootfall, were narrow little doors, their size and arrangement suggestive of thecells of a Victorian prison. But the upper portion of each door was of the samegreenish transparent stuff that had enclosed him at his awakening, and within,dimly seen, lay, in every case, a very young baby in a little nest of wadding.Elaborate apparatus watched the atmosphere and rang a bell far away in thecentral office at the slightest departure from the optimum of temperature andmoisture. A system of such crèches had almost entirely replaced the hazardousadventures of the Old World nursing. The attendant presently called Graham’sattention to the wet nurses, a vista of mechanical figures, with arms, shouldersand breasts of astonishingly realistic modelling, articulation and texture, butmere brass tripods below, and having in the place of features a flat discbearing advertisements likely to be of interest to mothers.Of all the strange things that Graham came upon that night, none jarred moreupon his habits of thought than this place. The spectacle of the little pinkcreatures, their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague first movements, leftalone, without embrace or endearment, was wholly repugnant to him. The attendantdoctor was of a different opinion. His statistical evidence showed beyonddispute that in the Victorian times the most dangerous passage of life was thearms of the mother, that there human mortality had ever been most terrible. Onthe other hand this crèche company, the International Crèche Syndicate, lost notone-half per cent of the million babies or so that formed its peculiar care. ButGraham’s prejudice was too strong even for those figures.Along one of the many passages of the place they presently came upon a youngcouple in the usual blue canvas peering through the transparency and laughinghysterically at the bald head of their first-born. Graham’s face must haveshowed his estimate of them, for their merriment ceased and they looked abashed.But this little incident accentuated his sudden realisation of the gulf betweenhis habits of thought and the ways of the new age. He passed on to the crawlingrooms and the Kindergarten, perplexed and distressed. He found the endless longplayrooms were empty! the latter-day children at least still spent their nightsin sleep. As they went through these, the little officer pointed out the natureof the toys, developments of those devised by that inspired sentimentalistFroebel. There were nurses here, but much was done by machines that sang anddanced and dandled.Graham was still not clear upon many points. “But so many orphans,” he saidperplexed, reverting to a first misconception, and learnt again that they werenot orphans.So soon as they had left the crèche he began to speak of the horror the babiesin their incubating cases had caused him. “Is motherhood gone?” he said. “Was ita cant? Surely it was an instinct. This seems so unnatural—abominable almost.”“Along here we shall come to the dancing place,” said Asano by way of reply. “Itis sure to be crowded. In spite of all the political unrest it will be crowded.The women take no great interest in politics—except a few here and there. Youwill see the mothers—most young women in London are mothers. In that class it isconsidered a creditable thing to have one child—a proof of animation. Few middleclass people have more than one. With the Labour Company it is different. As formotherhood! They still take an immense pride in the children. They come here tolook at them quite often.”“Then do you mean that the population of the world—?”“Is falling? Yes. Except among the people under the Labour Company. They arereckless—.”The air was suddenly dancing with music, and down a way they approachedobliquely, set with gorgeous pillars as it seemed of clear amethyst, flowed aconcourse of gay people and a tumult of merry cries and laughter. He saw curledheads, wreathed brows, and a happy intricate flutter of gamboge pass triumphantacross the picture.“You will see,” said Asano with a faint smile. “The world has changed. In amoment you will see the mothers of the new age. Come this way. We shall seethose yonder again very soon.”They ascended a certain height in a swift lift, and changed to a slower one. Asthey went on the music grew upon them, until it was near and full and splendid,and, moving with its glorious intricacies they could distinguish the beat ofinnumerable dancing feet. They made a payment at a turnstile, and emerged uponthe wide gallery that overlooked the dancing place, and upon the fullenchantment of sound and sight.“Here,” said Asano, “are the fathers and mothers of the little ones you saw.”The hall was not so richly decorated as that of the Atlas, but saving that, itwas, for its size, the most splendid Graham had seen. The beautiful white-limbedfigures that supported the galleries reminded him once more of the restoredmagnificence of sculpture; they seemed to writhe in engaging attitudes, theirfaces laughed. The source of the music that filled the place was hidden, and thewhole vast shining floor was thick with dancing couples. “Look at them,” saidthe little officer, “see how much they show of motherhood.”The gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge of a huge screen that cutthe dancing hall on one side from a sort of outer hall that showed through broadarches the incessant onward rush of the city ways. In this outer hall was agreat crowd of less brilliantly dressed people, as numerous almost as those whodanced within, the great majority wearing the blue uniform of the Labour Companythat was now so familiar to Graham. Too poor to pass the turnstiles to thefestival, they were yet unable to keep away from the sound of its seductions.Some of them even had cleared spaces, and were dancing also, fluttering theirrags in the air. Some shouted as they danced, jests and odd allusions Graham didnot understand. Once someone began whistling the refrain of the revolutionarysong, but it seemed as though that beginning was promptly suppressed. The cornerwas dark and Graham could not see. He turned to the hall again. Above thecaryatidæ were marble busts of men whom that age esteemed great moralemancipators and pioneers; for the most part their names were strange to Graham,though he recognised Grant Allen, Le Gallienne, Nietzsche, Shelley and Goodwin.Great black festoons and eloquent sentiments reinforced the huge inscriptionthat partially defaced the upper end of the dancing place, and asserted that“The Festival of the Awakening” was in progress.“Myriads are taking holiday or staying from work because of that, quite apartfrom the labourers who refuse to go back,” said Asano. “These people are alwaysready for holidays.”Graham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over, looking down at thedancers. Save for two or three remote whispering couples, who had stolen apart,he and his guide had the gallery to themselves. A warm breath of scent andvitality came up to him. Both men and women below were lightly clad, bare-armed,open-necked, as the universal warmth of the city permitted. The hair of the menwas often a mass of effeminate curls, their chins were always shaven, and manyof them had flushed or coloured cheeks. Many of the women were very pretty, andall were dressed with elaborate coquetry. As they swept by beneath, he sawecstatic faces with eyes half closed in pleasure.“What sort of people are these?” he asked abruptly.“Workers—prosperous workers. What you would have called the middle class.Independent tradesmen with little separate businesses have vanished long ago,but there are store servers, managers, engineers of a hundred sorts. Tonight isa holiday of course, and every dancing place in the city will be crowded, andevery place of worship.”“But—the women?”“The same. There’s a thousand forms of work for women now. But you had thebeginning of the independent working-woman in your days. Most women areindependent now. Most of these are married more or less—there are a number ofmethods of contract—and that gives them more money, and enables them to enjoythemselves.”“I see,” said Graham looking at the flushed faces, the flash and swirl ofmovement, and still thinking of that nightmare of pink helpless limbs. “Andthese are—mothers.”“Most of them.”“The more I see of these things the more complex I find your problems. This, forinstance, is a surprise. That news from Paris was a surprise.”In a little while he spoke again:“These are mothers. Presently, I suppose, I shall get into the modern way ofseeing things. I have old habits of mind clinging about me—habits based, Isuppose, on needs that are over and done with. Of course, in our time, a womanwas supposed not only to bear children, but to cherish them, to devote herselfto them, to educate them—all the essentials of moral and mental education achild owed its mother. Or went without. Quite a number, I admit, went without.Nowadays, clearly, there is no more need for such care than if they werebutterflies. I see that! Only there was an ideal—that figure of a grave, patientwoman, silently and serenely mistress of a home, mother and maker of men—to loveher was a sort of worship—”He stopped and repeated, “A sort of worship.”“Ideals change,” said the little man, “as needs change.”Graham awoke from an instant reverie and Asano repeated his words. Graham’s mindreturned to the thing at hand.“Of course I see the perfect reasonableness of this. Restraint, soberness, thematured thought, the unselfish act, they are necessities of the barbarous state,the life of dangers. Dourness is man’s tribute to unconquered nature. But manhas conquered nature now for all practical purposes—his political affairs aremanaged by Bosses with a black police—and life is joyous.”He looked at the dancers again. “Joyous,” he said.“There are weary moments,” said the little officer, reflectively.“They all look young. Down there I should be visibly the oldest man. And in myown time I should have passed as middle-aged.”“They are young. There are few old people in this class in the work cities.”“How is that?”“Old people’s lives are not so pleasant as they used to be, unless they are richto hire lovers and helpers. And we have an institution called Euthanasy.”“Ah! that Euthanasy!” said Graham. “The easy death?”“The easy death. It is the last pleasure. The Euthanasy Company does it well.People will pay the sum—it is a costly thing—long beforehand, go off to somepleasure city and return impoverished and weary, very weary.”“There is a lot left for me to understand,” said Graham after a pause. “Yet Isee the logic of it all. Our array of angry virtues and sour restraints was theconsequence of danger and insecurity. The Stoic, the Puritan, even in my time,were vanishing types. In the old days man was armed against Pain, now he iseager for Pleasure. There lies the difference. Civilisation has driven pain anddanger so far off—for well-to-do people. And only well-to-do people matter now.I have been asleep two hundred years.”For a minute they leant on the balustrading, following the intricate evolutionof the dance. Indeed the scene was very beautiful.“Before God,” said Graham, suddenly, “I would rather be a wounded sentinelfreezing in the snow than one of these painted fools!”“In the snow,” said Asano, “one might think differently.”“I am uncivilised,” said Graham, not heeding him. “That is the trouble. I amprimitive—Palæolithic. Their fountain of rage and fear and anger is sealed andclosed, the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and easy and delightful. Youmust bear with my nineteenth century shocks and disgusts. These people, you say,are skilled workers and so forth. And while these dance, men are fighting—menare dying in Paris to keep the world—that they may dance.”Asano smiled faintly. “For that matter, men are dying in London,” he said.There was a moment’s silence.“Where do these sleep?” asked Graham.“Above and below—an intricate warren.”“And where do they work? This is—the domestic life.”“You will see little work to-night. Half the workers are out or under arms. Halfthese people are keeping holiday. But we will go to the work places if you wishit.”For a time Graham watched the dancers, then suddenly turned away. “I want to seethe workers. I have seen enough of these,” he said.Asano led the way along the gallery across the dancing hall. Presently they cameto a transverse passage that brought a breath of fresher, colder air.Asano glanced at this passage as they went past, stopped, went back to it, andturned to Graham with a smile. “Here, Sire,” he said, “is something—will befamiliar to you at least—and yet—. But I will not tell you. Come!”He led the way along a closed passage that presently became cold. Thereverberation of their feet told that this passage was a bridge. They came intoa circular gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather, and so reached acircular chamber which seemed familiar, though Graham could not recalldistinctly when he had entered it before. In this was a ladder—the first ladderhe had seen since his awakening—up which they went, and came into a high, dark,cold place in which was another almost vertical ladder. This they ascended,Graham still perplexed.But at the top he understood, and recognized the metallic bars to which heclung. He was in the cage under the ball of St. Paul’s. The dome rose but alittle way above the general contour of the city, into the still twilight, andsloped away, shining greasily under a few distant lights, into a circumambientditch of darkness.Out between the bars he looked upon the wind-clear northern sky and saw thestarry constellations all unchanged. Capella hung in the west, Vega was rising,and the seven glittering points of the Great Bear swept overhead in theirstately circle about the Pole.He saw these stars in a clear gap of sky. To the east and south the greatcircular shapes of complaining wind-wheels blotted out the heavens, so that theglare about the Council House was hidden. To the south-west hung Orion, showinglike a pallid ghost through a tracery of iron-work and interlacing shapes abovea dazzling coruscation of lights. A bellowing and siren screaming that came fromthe flying stages warned the world that one of the aëroplanes was ready tostart. He remained for a space gazing towards the glaring stage. Then his eyeswent back to the northward constellations.For a long time he was silent. “This,” he said at last, smiling in the shadow,“seems the strangest thing of all. To stand in the dome of Saint Paul’s and lookonce more upon these familiar, silent stars!”Thence Graham was taken by Asano along devious ways to the great gambling andbusiness quarters where the bulk of the fortunes in the city were lost and made.It impressed him as a well-nigh interminable series of very high halls,surrounded by tiers upon tiers of galleries into which opened thousands ofoffices, and traversed by a complicated multitude of bridges, foot-ways, aërialmotor rails, and trapeze and cable leaps. And here more than anywhere the noteof vehement vitality, of uncontrollable, hasty activity, rose high. Everywherewas violent advertisement, until his brain swam at the tumult of light andcolour. And Babble Machines of a peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filledthe air with strenuous squealing and an idiotic slang. “Skin your eyes andslide,” “Gewhoop, Bonanza,” “Gollipers come and hark!”The place seemed to him to be dense with people either profoundly agitated orswelling with obscure cunning, yet he learnt that the place was comparativelyempty, that the great political convulsion of the last few days had reducedtransactions to an unprecedented minimum. In one huge place were long avenues ofroulette tables, each with an excited, undignified crowd about it; in another ayelping Babel of white-faced women and red-necked leathery-lunged men bought andsold the shares of an absolutely fictitious business undertaking which, everyfive minutes, paid a dividend of ten per cent and cancelled a certain proportionof its shares by means of a lottery wheel.These business activities were prosecuted with an energy that readily passedinto violence, and Graham approaching a dense crowd found at its centre a coupleof prominent merchants in violent controversy with teeth and nails on somedelicate point of business etiquette. Something still remained in life to befought for. Further he had a shock at a vehement announcement in phoneticletters of scarlet flame each twice the height of a man, that “WE ASSURE THEPROPRAIET’R. WE ASSURE THE PROPRAIET’R.”“Who’s the proprietor?” he asked.“You.”“But what do they assure me?” he asked. “What do they assure me?”“Didn’t you have assurance?”Graham thought. “Insurance?”“Yes—Insurance. I remember that was the older word. They are insuring your life.Dozands of people are taking out policies, myriads of lions are being put onyou. And further on other people are buying annuities. They do that on everybodywho is at all prominent. Look there!”A crowd of people surged and roared, and Graham saw a vast black screen suddenlyilluminated in still larger letters of burning purple. “Anuetes on thePropraiet’r—x 5 pr. G.” The people began to boo and shout at this, a number ofhard breathing, wild-eyed men came running past, clawing with hooked fingers atthe air. There was a furious crush about a little doorway.Asano did a brief calculation. “Seventeen per cent per annum is their annuity onyou. They would not pay so much per cent if they could see you now, Sire. Butthey do not know. Your own annuities used to be a very safe investment, but nowyou are sheer gambling, of course. This is probably a desperate bid. I doubt ifpeople will get their money.”The crowd of would-be annuitants grew so thick about them that for some timethey could move neither forward nor backward. Graham noticed what appeared tohim to be a high proportion of women among the speculators, and was remindedagain of the economical independence of their sex. They seemed remarkably wellable to take care of themselves in the crowd, using their elbows with particularskill, as he learnt to his cost. One curly-headed person caught in the pressurefor a space, looked steadfastly at him several times, almost as if sherecognized him, and then, edging deliberately towards him, touched his hand withher arm in a scarcely accidental manner, and made it plain by a look as ancientas Chaldea that he had found favour in her eyes. And then a lank, grey-beardedman, perspiring copiously in a noble passion of self-help, blind to all earthlythings save that glaring bait, thrust between them in a cataclysmal rush towardsthat alluring “x 5 pr. G.”“I want to get out of this,” said Graham to Asano. “This is not what I came tosee. Show me the workers. I want to see the people in blue. These parasiticlunatics—”He found himself wedged in a struggling mass of people, and this hopefulsentence went unfinished."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21THE UNDER SIDEFrom the Business Quarter they presently passed by the running ways into aremote quarter of the city, where the bulk of the manufactures was done. Ontheir way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in a broad viaductacross one of the great roads that entered the city from the North. In bothcases his impression was swift and in both very vivid. The river was a broadwrinkled glitter of black sea water, overarched by buildings, and vanishingeither way into a blackness starred with receding lights. A string of blackbarges passed seaward, manned by blue-clad men. The road was a long and verybroad and high tunnel, along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly andswiftly. Here, too, the distinctive blue of the Labour Company was in abundance.The smoothness of the double tracks, the largeness and the lightness of the bigpneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body, struck Graham mostvividly. One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hungwith the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly.Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out the picture.Presently they left the way and descended by a lift and traversed a passage thatsloped downward, and so came to a descending lift again. The appearance ofthings changed. Even the pretence of architectural ornament disappeared, thelights diminished in number and size, the architecture became more and moremassive in proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were reached. And inthe dusty biscuit-making place of the potters, among the felspar mills in thefurnace rooms of the metal workers, among the incandescent lakes of crudeEadhamite, the blue canvas clothing was on man, woman and child.Many of these great and dusty galleries were silent avenues of machinery,endless raked out ashen furnaces testified to the revolutionary dislocation, butwherever there was work it was being done by slow-moving workers in blue canvas.The only people not in blue canvas were the overlookers of the work-places andthe orange-clad Labour Police. And fresh from the flushed faces of the dancinghalls, the voluntary vigours of the business quarter, Graham could note thepinched faces, the feeble muscles, and weary eyes of many of the latter-dayworkers. Such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in physique to the fewgaily dressed managers and forewomen who were directing their labours. The burlylabourers of the old Victorian times had followed the dray horse and all suchliving force producers, to extinction; the place of his costly muscles was takenby some dexterous machine. The latter-day labourer, male as well as female, wasessentially a machine-minder and feeder, a servant and attendant, or an artistunder direction.The women, in comparison with those Graham remembered, were as a classdistinctly plain and flat-chested. Two hundred years of emancipation from themoral restraints of Puritanical religion, two hundred years of city life, haddone their work in eliminating the strain of feminine beauty and vigour from theblue canvas myriads. To be brilliant physically or mentally, to be in any wayattractive or exceptional, had been and was still a certain way of emancipationto the drudge, a line of escape to the Pleasure City and its splendours anddelights, and at last to the Euthanasy and peace. To be steadfast against suchinducements was scarcely to be expected of meanly nourished souls. In the youngcities of Graham’s former life, the newly aggregated labouring mass had been adiverse multitude, still stirred by the tradition of personal honour and a highmorality; now it was differentiating into a distinct class, with a moral andphysical difference of its own—even with a dialect of its own.They penetrated downward, ever downward, towards the working places. Presentlythey passed underneath one of the streets of the moving ways, and saw itsplatforms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks of white lightsbetween the transverse slits. The factories that were not working were sparselylighted; to Graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines seemedplunged in gloom, and even where work was going on the illumination was far lessbrilliant than upon the public ways.Beyond the blazing lakes of Eadhamite he came to the warren of the jewellers,and, with some difficulty and by using his signature, obtained admission tothese galleries. They were high and dark, and rather cold. In the first a fewmen were making ornaments of gold filigree, each man at a little bench byhimself, and with a little shaded light. The long vista of light patches, withthe nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among the gleaming yellow coils, andthe intent face like the face of a ghost, in each shadow, had the oddest effect.The work was beautifully executed, but without any strength of modelling ordrawing, for the most part intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes ona geometrical motif. These workers wore a peculiar white uniform without pocketsor sleeves. They assumed this on coming to work, but at night they were strippedand examined before they left the premises of the Company. In spite of everyprecaution, the Labour policeman told them in a depressed tone, the Company wasnot infrequently robbed.Beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and setting slabs of artificialruby, and next these were men and women busied together upon the slabs of coppernet that formed the basis of cloisonné tiles. Many of these workers had lips andnostrils a livid white, due to a disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel thatchanced to be much in fashion. Asano apologised to Graham for the offence oftheir faces, but excused himself on the score of the convenience of this route.“This is what I wanted to see,” said Graham; “this is what I wanted to see,”trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking disfigurement that suddenlystared him in the face.“She might have done better with herself than that,” said Asano.Graham made some indignant comments.“But, Sire, we simply could not stand that stuff without the purple,” saidAsano. “In your days people could stand such crudities, they were nearer thebarbaric by two hundred years.”They continued along one of the lower galleries of this cloisonné factory, andcame to a little bridge that spanned a vault. Looking over the parapet, Grahamsaw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous archings than any he hadseen. Three barges, smothered in floury dust, were being unloaded of theircargoes of powdered felspar by a multitude of coughing men, each guiding alittle truck; the dust filled the place with a choking mist, and turned theelectric glare yellow. The vague shadows of these workers gesticulated abouttheir feet, and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of white-washed wall.Every now and then one would stop to cough.A shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the inky water, brought toGraham’s mind the thought of the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts, thatrose floor above floor overhead between him and the sky. The men worked insilence under the supervision of two of the Labour Police; their feet made ahollow thunder on the planks along which they went to and fro. And as he lookedat this scene, some hidden voice in the darkness began to sing.“Stop that!” shouted one of the policemen, but the order was disobeyed, andfirst one and then all the white-stained men who were working there had taken upthe beating refrain, singing it defiantly, the Song of the Revolt. The feet uponthe planks thundered now to the rhythm of the song, tramp, tramp, tramp. Thepoliceman who had shouted glanced at his fellow, and Graham saw him shrug hisshoulders. He made no further effort to stop the singing.And so they went through these factories and places of toil, seeing many painfuland grim things. But why should the gentle reader be depressed? Surely to arefined nature our present world is distressing enough without botheringourselves about these miseries to come. We shall not suffer anyhow. Our childrenmay, but what is that to us? That walk left on Graham’s mind a maze of memories,fluctuating pictures of swathed halls, and crowded vaults seen through clouds ofdust, of intricate machines, the racing threads of looms, the heavy beat ofstamping machinery, the roar and rattle of belt and armature, of ill-litsubterranean aisles of sleeping places, illimitable vistas of pin-point lights.And here the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery and here,unprecedented reeks. And everywhere were pillars and cross archings of such amassiveness as Graham had never before seen, thick Titans of greasy, shiningbrickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of that complex city world, even asthese anæmic millions were crushed by its complexity. And everywhere were palefeatures, lean limbs, disfigurement and degradation.Once and again, and again a third time, Graham heard the song of the revoltduring his long, unpleasant research in these places, and once he saw a confusedstruggle down a passage, and learnt that a number of these serfs had seizedtheir bread before their work was done. Graham was ascending towards the waysagain when he saw a number of blue-clad children running down a transversepassage, and presently perceived the reason of their panic in a company of theLabour Police armed with clubs, trotting towards some unknown disturbance. Andthen came a remote disorder. But for the most part this remnant that worked,worked hopelessly. All the spirit that was left in fallen humanity was above inthe streets that night, calling for the Master, and valiantly and noisilykeeping its arms.They emerged from these wanderings and stood blinking in the bright light of themiddle passage of the platforms again. They became aware of the remote hootingand yelping of the machines of one of the General Intelligence Offices, andsuddenly came men running, and along the platforms and about the ways everywherewas a shouting and crying. Then a woman with a face of mute white terror, andanother who gasped and shrieked as she ran.“What has happened now?” said Graham, puzzled, for he could not understand theirthick speech. Then he heard it in English and perceived that the thing thateveryone was shouting, that men yelled to one another, that women took upscreaming, that was passing like the first breeze of a thunderstorm, chill andsudden through the city, was this: “Ostrog has ordered the Black Police toLondon. The Black Police are coming from South Africa. . . . The Black Police.The Black Police.”Asano’s face was white and astonished; he hesitated, looked at Graham’s face,and told him the thing he already knew. “But how can they know?” asked Asano.Graham heard someone shouting. “Stop all work. Stop all work,” and a swarthyhunchback, ridiculously gay in green and gold, came leaping down the platformstoward him, bawling again and again in good English, “This is Ostrog’s doing,Ostrog, the Knave! The Master is betrayed.” His voice was hoarse and a thin foamdropped from his ugly shouting mouth. He yelled an unspeakable horror that theBlack Police had done in Paris, and so passed shrieking, “Ostrog the Knave!”For a moment Graham stood still, for it had come upon him again that thesethings were a dream. He looked up at the great cliff of buildings on eitherside, vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and down to the roaringtiers of platforms, and the shouting, running people who were gesticulatingpast. “The Master is betrayed!” they cried. “The Master is betrayed!”Suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real and urgent. His heartbegan to beat fast and strong.“It has come,” he said. “I might have known. The hour has come.”He thought swiftly. “What am I to do?”“Go back to the Council House,” said Asano.“Why should I not appeal—? The people are here.”“You will lose time. They will doubt if it is you. But they will mass about theCouncil House. There you will find their leaders. Your strength is there—withthem.”“Suppose this is only a rumour?”“It sounds true,” said Asano.“Let us have the facts,” said Graham.Asano shrugged his shoulders. “We had better get towards the Council House,” hecried. “That is where they will swarm. Even now the ruins may be impassable.”Graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him.They went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest one, and there Asano accosteda labourer. The answers to his questions were in the thick, vulgar speech.“What did he say?” asked Graham.“He knows little, but he told me that the Black Police would have arrived herebefore the people knew—had not someone in the wind-vane offices learnt. He saida girl.”“A girl? Not—?”“He said a girl—he did not know who she was. Who came out from the Council Housecrying aloud, and told the men at work among the ruins.”And then another thing was shouted, something that turned an aimless tumult intodeterminate movements, it came like a wind along the street. “To your Wards, toyour Wards. Every man get arms. Every man to his Ward!”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22THE STRUGGLE IN THE COUNCIL HOUSEAs Asano and Graham hurried along to the ruins about the Council House, they saweverywhere the excitement of the people rising. “To your Wards! To your Wards!”Everywhere men and women in blue were hurrying from unknown subterraneanemployments, up the staircases of the middle path; at one place Graham saw anarsenal of the revolutionary committee besieged by a crowd of shouting men, atanother a couple of men in the hated yellow uniform of the Labour Police,pursued by a gathering crowd, fled precipitately along the swift way that wentin the opposite direction.The cries of “To your Wards!” became at last a continuous shouting as they drewnear the Government quarter. Many of the shouts were unintelligible. “Ostrog hasbetrayed us,” one man bawled in a hoarse voice, again and again, dinning thatrefrain into Graham’s ear until it haunted him. This person stayed close besideGraham and Asano on the swift way, shouting to the people who swarmed on thelower platforms as he rushed past them. His cry about Ostrog alternated withsome incomprehensible orders. Presently he went leaping down and disappeared.Graham’s mind was filled with the din. His plans were vague and unformed. He hadone picture of some commanding position from which he could address themultitudes, another of meeting Ostrog face to face. He was full of rage, oftense muscular excitement, his hands gripped, his lips were pressed together.The way to the Council House across the ruins was impassable, but Asano met thatdifficulty and took Graham into the premises of the central post-office. Thepost-office was nominally at work, but the blue-clothed porters moved sluggishlyor had stopped to stare through the arches of their galleries at the shoutingmen who were going by outside. “Every man to his Ward! Every man to his Ward!”Here, by Asano’s advice, Graham revealed his identity.They crossed to the Council House by a cable cradle. Already in the briefinterval since the capitulation of the Councillors a great change had beenwrought in the appearance of the ruins. The spurting cascades of the rupturedsea water-mains had been captured and tamed, and huge temporary pipes ranoverhead along a flimsy looking fabric of girders. The sky was laced withrestored cables and wires that served the Council House, and a mass of newfabric with cranes and other building machines going to and fro upon it,projected to the left of the white pile.The moving ways that ran across this area had been restored, albeit for oncerunning under the open sky. These were the ways that Graham had seen from thelittle balcony in the hour of his awakening, not nine days since, and the hallof his Trance had been on the further side, where now shapeless piles of smashedand shattered masonry were heaped together.It was already high day and the sun was shining brightly. Out of their tallcaverns of blue electric light came the swift ways crowded with multitudes ofpeople, who poured off them and gathered ever denser over the wreckage andconfusion of the ruins. The air was full of their shouting, and they werepressing and swaying towards the central building. For the most part thatshouting mass consisted of shapeless swarms, but here and there Graham could seethat a rude discipline struggled to establish itself. And every voice clamouredfor order in the chaos. “To your Wards! Every man to his Ward!”The cable carried them into a hall which Graham recognised as the ante-chamberto the Hall of the Atlas, about the gallery of which he had walked days ago withHoward to show himself to the vanished Council, an hour from his awakening. Nowthe place was empty except for two cable attendants. These men seemed hugelyastonished to recognise the Sleeper in the man who swung down from the crossseat.“Where is Helen Wotton?” he demanded. “Where is Helen Wotton?”They did not know.“Then where is Ostrog? I must see Ostrog forthwith. He has disobeyed me. I havecome back to take things out of his hands.” Without waiting for Asano, he wentstraight across the place, ascended the steps at the further end, and, pullingthe curtain aside, found himself facing the perpetually labouring Titan.The hall was empty. Its appearance had changed very greatly since his firstsight of it. It had suffered serious injury in the violent struggle of the firstoutbreak. On the right hand side of the great figure the upper half of the wallhad been torn away for nearly two hundred feet of its length, and a sheet of thesame glassy film that had enclosed Graham at his awakening had been drawn acrossthe gap. This deadened, but did not altogether exclude the roar of the peopleoutside. “Wards! Wards! Wards!” they seemed to be saying. Through it there werevisible the beams and supports of metal scaffoldings that rose and fellaccording to the requirements of a great crowd of workmen. An idle buildingmachine, with lank arms of red painted metal that caught the still plasticblocks of mineral paste and swung them neatly into position, stretched gauntlyacross this green tinted picture. On it were still a number of workmen staringat the crowd below. For a moment he stood regarding these things, and Asanoovertook him.“Ostrog,” said Asano, “will be in the small offices beyond there.” The littleman looked livid now and his eyes searched Graham’s face.They had scarcely advanced ten paces from the curtain before a little panel tothe left of the Atlas rolled up, and Ostrog, accompanied by Lincoln and followedby two black and yellow clad negroes, appeared crossing the remote corner of thehall, towards a second panel that was raised and open. “Ostrog,” shouted Graham,and at the sound of his voice the little party turned astonished.Ostrog said something to Lincoln and advanced alone.Graham was the first to speak. His voice was loud and dictatorial. “What is thisI hear?” he asked. “Are you bringing negroes here—to keep the people down?”“It is none too soon,” said Ostrog. “They have been getting out of hand more andmore, since the revolt. I under-estimated—”“Do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the way?”“On the way. As it is, you have seen the people—outside?”“No wonder! But—after what was said. You have taken too much on yourself,Ostrog.”Ostrog said nothing, but drew nearer.“These negroes must not come to London,” said Graham. “I am Master and theyshall not come.”Ostrog glanced at Lincoln, who at once came towards them with his two attendantsclose behind him. “Why not?” asked Ostrog.“White men must be mastered by white men. Besides—”“The negroes are only an instrument.”“But that is not the question. I am the Master. I mean to be the Master. And Itell you these negroes shall not come.”“The people—”“I believe in the people.”“Because you are an anachronism. You are a man out of the Past—an accident. Youare Owner perhaps of half the property in the world. But you are not Master. Youdo not know enough to be Master.”He glanced at Lincoln again. “I know now what you think—I can guess something ofwhat you mean to do. Even now it is not too late to warn you. You dream of humanequality—of a socialistic order—you have all those worn-out dreams of thenineteenth century fresh and vivid in your mind, and you would rule this agethat you do not understand.”“Listen!” said Graham. “You can hear it—a sound like the sea. Not voices—but avoice. Do you altogether understand?”“We taught them that,” said Ostrog.“Perhaps. Can you teach them to forget it? But enough of this! These negroesmust not come.”There was a pause and Ostrog looked him in the eyes.“They will,” he said.“I forbid it,” said Graham.“They have started.”“I will not have it.”“No,” said Ostrog. “Sorry as I am to follow the method of the Council—. For yourown good—you must not side with— Disorder. And now that you are here—. It waskind of you to come here.”Lincoln laid his hand on Graham’s shoulder. Abruptly Graham realized theenormity of his blunder in coming to the Council House. He turned towards thecurtains that separated the hall from the ante-chamber. The clutching hand ofAsano intervened. In another moment Lincoln had grasped Graham’s cloak.He turned and struck at Lincoln’s face, and incontinently a negro had him bycollar and arm. He wrenched himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and hestumbled back, to be tripped by the other attendant. Then he struck the groundheavily and he was staring at the distant ceiling of the hall.He shouted, rolled over, struggling fiercely, clutched an attendant’s leg andthrew him headlong, and struggled to his feet.Lincoln appeared before him, went down heavily again with a blow under the pointof the jaw and lay still. Graham made two strides, stumbled. And then Ostrog’sarm was round his neck, he was pulled over backward, fell heavily, and his armswere pinned to the ground. After a few violent efforts he ceased to struggle andlay staring at Ostrog’s heaving throat.“You—are—a prisoner,” panted Ostrog, exulting. “You— were rather a fool—to comeback.”Graham turned his head about and perceived through the irregular green window inthe walls of the hall the men who had been working the building cranesgesticulating excitedly to the people below them. They had seen!Ostrog followed his eyes and started. He shouted something to Lincoln, butLincoln did not move. A bullet smashed among the mouldings above the Atlas. Thetwo sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched across this gap wererent, the edges of the torn aperture darkened, curved, ran rapidly towards theframework, and in a moment the Council chamber stood open to the air. A chillygust blew in by the gap, bringing with it a war of voices from the ruinousspaces without, an elvish babblement, “Save the Master!” “What are they doing tothe Master?” “The Master is betrayed!”And then he realised that Ostrog’s attention was distracted, that Ostrog’s griphad relaxed, and, wrenching his arms free, he struggled to his knees. In anothermoment he had thrust Ostrog back, and he was on one foot, his hand grippingOstrog’s throat, and Ostrog’s hands clutching the silk about his neck.But now men were coming towards them from the dais—men whose intentions hemisunderstood. He had a glimpse of someone running in the distance towards thecurtains of the ante-chamber, and then Ostrog had slipped from him and these newcomers were upon him. To his infinite astonishment, they seized him. They obeyedthe shouts of Ostrog.He was lugged a dozen yards before he realised that they were not friends—thatthey were dragging him towards the open panel. When he saw this he pulled back,he tried to fling himself down, he shouted for help with all his strength. Andthis time there were answering cries.The grip upon his neck relaxed, and behold! in the lower corner of the rent uponthe wall, first one and then a number of little black figures appeared shoutingand waving arms. They came leaping down from the gap into the light gallery thathad led to the Silent Rooms. They ran along it, so near were they that Grahamcould see the weapons in their hands. Then Ostrog was shouting in his ear to themen who held him, and once more he was struggling with all his strength againsttheir endeavours to thrust him towards the opening that yawned to receive him.“They can’t come down,” panted Ostrog. “They daren’t fire. It’s all right. We’llsave him from them yet.”For long minutes as it seemed to Graham that inglorious struggle continued. Hisclothes were rent in a dozen places, he was covered in dust, one hand had beentrodden upon. He could hear the shouts of his supporters, and once he heardshots. He could feel his strength giving way, feel his efforts wild and aimless.But no help came, and surely, irresistibly, that black, yawning opening camenearer.The pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up. He saw Ostrog’s grey headreceding and perceived that he was no longer held. He turned about and came fullinto a man in black. One of the green weapons cracked close to him, a drift ofpungent smoke came into his face, and a steel blade flashed. The huge chamberspan about him.He saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black and yellow attendants notthree yards from his face. Then hands were upon him again.He was being pulled in two directions now. It seemed as though people wereshouting to him. He wanted to understand and could not. Someone was clutchingabout his thighs, he was being hoisted in spite of his vigorous efforts. Heunderstood suddenly, he ceased to struggle. He was lifted up on men’s shouldersand carried away from that devouring panel. Ten thousand throats were cheering.He saw men in blue and black hurrying after the retreating Ostrogites andfiring. Lifted up, he saw now across the whole expanse of the hall beneath theAtlas image, saw that he was being carried towards the raised platform in thecentre of the place. The far end of the hall was already full of people runningtowards him. They were looking at him and cheering.He became aware that a sort of body-guard surrounded him. Active men about himshouted vague orders. He saw close at hand the black moustached man in yellowwho had been among those who had greeted him in the public theatre, shoutingdirections. The hall was already densely packed with swaying people, the littlemetal gallery sagged with a shouting load, the curtains at the end had been tornaway, and the ante-chamber was revealed densely crowded. He could scarcely makethe man near him hear for the tumult about them. “Where has Ostrog gone?” heasked.The man he questioned pointed over the heads towards the lower panels about thehall on the side opposite the gap. They stood open and armed men, blue clad withblack sashes, were running through them and vanishing into the chambers andpassages beyond. It seemed to Graham that a sound of firing drifted through theriot. He was carried in a staggering curve across the great hall towards anopening beneath the gap.He perceived men working with a sort of rude discipline to keep the crowd offhim, to make a space clear about him. He passed out of the hall, and saw acrude, new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue sky. He was swung downto his feet; someone gripped his arm and guided him. He found the man in yellowclose at hand. They were taking him up a narrow stairway of brick, and close athand rose the great red painted masses, the cranes and levers and the stillengines of the big building machine.He was at the top of the steps. He was hurried across a narrow railed footway,and suddenly with a vast shouting the amphitheatre of ruins opened again beforehim. “The Master is with us! The Master! The Master!” The shout swept athwartthe lake of faces like a wave, broke against the distant cliff of ruins, andcame back in a welter of cries. “The Master is on our side!”Graham perceived that he was no longer encompassed by people, that he wasstanding upon a little temporary platform of white metal, part of a flimsyseeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of the Council House. Overall the huge expanse of the ruins, swayed and eddied the shouting people; andhere and there the black banners of the revolutionary societies ducked andswayed and formed rare nuclei of organisation in the chaos. Up the steep stairsof wall and scaffolding by which his rescuers had reached the opening in theAtlas Chamber, clung a solid crowd, and little energetic black figures clingingto pillars and projections were strenuous to induce these congested masses tostir. Behind him, at a higher point on the scaffolding, a number of menstruggled upwards with the flapping folds of a huge black standard. Through theyawning gap in the walls below him he could look down upon the packed attentivemultitudes in the Hall of the Atlas. The distant flying stages to the south cameout bright and vivid, brought nearer as it seemed by an unusual translucency ofthe air. A solitary aëropile beat up from the central stage as if to meet thecoming aëroplanes.“What had become of Ostrog?” asked Graham, and even as he spoke he saw that alleyes were turned from him towards the crest of the Council House building. Helooked also in this direction of universal attention. For a moment he sawnothing but the jagged corner of a wall, hard and clear against the sky. Then inthe shadow he perceived the interior of a room and recognised with a start thegreen and white decorations of his former prison. And coming quickly across thisopened room and up to the very verge of the cliff of the ruins came a littlewhite-clad figure followed by two other smaller seeming figures in black andyellow. He heard the man beside him exclaim “Ostrog,” and turned to ask aquestion. But he never did, because of the startled exclamation of another ofthose who were with him and a lank finger suddenly pointing. He looked, andbehold the aëropile that had been rising from the flying stage when last he hadlooked in that direction, was driving towards them. The swift steady flight wasstill novel enough to hold his attention.Nearer it came, growing rapidly larger and larger, until it had swept over thefurther edge of the ruins and into view of the dense multitudes below. Itdrooped across the space and rose and passed overhead, rising to clear the massof the Council House, a filmy translucent shape with the solitary aëronautpeering down through its ribs. It vanished beyond the skyline of the ruins.Graham transferred his attention to Ostrog. He was signalling with his hands,and his attendants busy breaking down the wall beside him. In another moment theaëropile came into view again, a little thing far away, coming round in a widecurve and going slower.Then suddenly the man in yellow shouted: “What are they doing? What are thepeople doing? Why is Ostrog left there? Why is he not captured? They will lifthim—the aëropile will lift him! Ah!”The exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins. The rattling sound of thegreen weapons drifted across the intervening gulf to Graham, and, looking down,he saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running along one of the galleriesthat lay open to the air below the promontory upon which Ostrog stood. Theyfired as they ran at men unseen, and then emerged a number of pale blue figuresin pursuit. These minute fighting figures had the oddest effect; they seemed asthey ran like little model soldiers in a toy. This queer appearance of a housecut open gave that struggle amidst furniture and passages a quality ofunreality. It was perhaps two hundred yards away from him, and very nearly fiftyabove the heads in the ruins below. The black and yellow men ran into an openarchway, and turned and fired a volley. One of the blue pursuers stridingforward close to the edge, flung up his arms, staggered sideways, seemed toGraham’s sense to hang over the edge for several seconds, and fell headlongdown. Graham saw him strike a projecting corner, fly out, head over heels, headover heels, and vanish behind the red arm of the building machine.And then a shadow came between Graham and the sun. He looked up and the sky wasclear, but he knew the aëropile had passed. Ostrog had vanished. The man inyellow thrust before him, zealous and perspiring, pointing and blatent.“They are grounding!” cried the man in yellow. “They are grounding. Tell thepeople to fire at him. Tell them to fire at him!”Graham could not understand. He heard loud voices repeating these enigmaticalorders.Suddenly over the edge of the ruins he saw the prow of the aëropile come glidingand stop with a jerk. In a moment Graham understood that the thing had groundedin order that Ostrog might escape by it. He saw a blue haze climbing out of thegulf, perceived that the people below him were now firing up at the projectingstem.A man beside him cheered hoarsely, and he saw that the blue rebels had gainedthe archway that had been contested by the men in black and yellow a momentbefore, and were running in a continual stream along the open passage.And suddenly the aëropile slipped over the edge of the Council House and fell.It dropped, tilting at an angle of fortyfive degrees, and dropping so steeplythat it seemed to Graham, it seemed perhaps to most of those below, that itcould not possibly rise again.It fell so closely past him that he could see Ostrog clutching the guides of theseat, with his grey hair streaming; see the white-faced aëronaut wrenching overthe lever that drove the engine along its guides. He heard the apprehensivevague cry of innumerable men below.Graham clutched the railing before him and gasped. The second seemed an age. Thelower van of the aëropile passed within an ace of touching the people, whoyelled and screamed and trampled one another below.And then it rose.For a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear the opposite cliff, andthen that it could not possibly clear the wind-wheel that rotated beyond.And behold! it was clear and soaring, still heeling sideways, upward, upwardinto the wind-swept sky.The suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of exasperation as the swarmingpeople realised that Ostrog had escaped them. With belated activity they renewedtheir fire, until the rattling wove into a roar, until the whole area became dimand blue and the air pungent with the thin smoke of their weapons.Too late! The aëropile dwindled smaller and smaller, and curved about and sweptgracefully downward to the flying stage from which it had so lately risen.Ostrog had escaped.For a while a confused babblement arose from the ruins, and then the universalattention came back to Graham, perched high among the scaffolding. He saw thefaces of the people turned towards him, heard their shouts at his rescue. Fromthe throat of the ways came the song of the revolt spreading like a breezeacross that swaying sea of men.The little group of men about him shouted congratulations on his escape. The manin yellow was close to him, with a set face and shining eyes. And the song wasrising, louder and louder; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.Slowly the realisation came of the full meaning of these things to him, theperception of the swift change in his position. Ostrog, who had stood beside himwhenever he had faced that shouting multitude before, was beyond there—theantagonist. There was no one to rule for him any longer. Even the people abouthim, the leaders and organisers of the multitude, looked to see what he woulddo, looked to him to act, awaited his orders. He was King indeed. His puppetreign was at an end.He was very intent to do the thing that was expected of him. His nerves andmuscles were quivering, his mind was perhaps a little confused, but he feltneither fear nor anger. His hand that had been trodden upon throbbed and washot. He was a little nervous about his bearing. He knew he was not afraid, buthe was anxious not to seem afraid. In his former life he had often been moreexcited in playing games of skill. He was desirous of immediate action, he knewhe must not think too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggleabout him lest he should be paralysed by the sense of its intricacy. Over therethose square blue shapes, the flying stages, meant Ostrog; against Ostrog he wasfighting for the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23WHILE THE AËROPLANES WERE COMINGFor a time the Master of the Earth was not even master of his own mind. Even hiswill seemed a will not his own, his own acts surprised him and were but a partof the confusion of strange experiences that poured across his being. Thesethings were definite, the aëroplanes were coming, Helen Wotton had warned thepeople of their coming, and he was Master of the Earth. Each of these factsseemed struggling for complete possession of his thoughts. They protruded from abackground of swarming halls, elevated passages, rooms jammed with ward leadersin council, kinematograph and telephone rooms, and windows looking out on aseething sea of marching men. The man in yellow, and men whom he fancied werecalled Ward Leaders, were either propelling him forward or following himobediently; it was hard to tell. Perhaps they were doing a little of both.Perhaps some power unseen and unsuspected, propelled them all. He was aware thathe was going to make a proclamation to the People of the Earth, aware of certaingrandiose phrases floating in his mind as the thing he meant to say. Many littlethings happened, and then he found himself with the man in yellow entering alittle room where this proclamation of his was to be made.This room was grotesquely latter-day in its appointments. In the centre was abright oval lit by shaded electric lights from above. The rest was in shadow,and the double finely fitting doors through which he came from the swarming Hallof the Atlas made the place very still. The dead thud of these as they closedbehind him, the sudden cessation of the tumult in which he had been living forhours, the quivering circle of light, the whispers and quick noiseless movementsof vaguely visible attendants in the shadows, had a strange effect upon Graham.The huge ears of a phonographic mechanism gaped in a battery for his words, theblack eyes of great photographic cameras awaited his beginning, beyond metalrods and coils glittered dimly, and something whirled about with a droning hum.He walked into the centre of the light, and his shadow drew together black andsharp to a little blot at his feet.The vague shape of the thing he meant to say was already in his mind. But thissilence, this isolation, the sudden withdrawal from that contagious crowd, thissilent audience of gaping, glaring machines had not been in his anticipation.All his supports seemed withdrawn together; he seemed to have dropped into thissuddenly, suddenly to have discovered himself. In a moment he was changed. Hefound that he now feared to be inadequate, he feared to be theatrical, he fearedthe quality of his voice, the quality of his wit, astonished, he turned to theman in yellow with a propitiatory gesture. “For a moment,” he said, “I mustwait. I did not think it would be like this. I must think of the thing I have tosay.”While he was still hesitating there came an agitated messenger with news thatthe foremost aëroplanes were passing over Arawan.“Arawan?” he said. “Where is that? But anyhow, they are coming. They will behere. When?”“By twilight.”“Great God! In only a few hours. What news of the flying stages?” he asked.“The people of the south-west wards are ready.”“Ready!”He turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses again.“I suppose it must be a sort of speech. Would to God I knew certainly the thingthat should be said! Aëroplanes at Arawan! They must have started before themain fleet. And the people only ready! Surely . . .”“Oh! what does it matter whether I speak well or ill?” he said, and felt thelight grow brighter.He had framed some vague sentence of democratic sentiment when suddenly doubtsoverwhelmed him. His belief in his heroic quality and calling he found hadaltogether lost its assured conviction. The picture of a little struttingfutility in a windy waste of incomprehensible destinies replaced it. Abruptly itwas perfectly clear to him that this revolt against Ostrog was premature,foredoomed to failure, the impulse of passionate inadequacy against inevitablethings. He thought of that swift flight of aëroplanes like the swoop of Fatetowards him. He was astonished that he could have seen things in any otherlight. In that final emergency he debated, thrust debate resolutely aside,determined at all costs to go through with the thing he had undertaken. And hecould find no word to begin. Even as he stood, awkward, hesitating, with anindiscrete apology for his inability trembling on his lips, came the noise ofmany people crying out, the running to and fro of feet. “Wait,” cried someone,and a door opened. “She is coming,” said the voices. Graham turned, and thewatching lights waned.Through the open doorway he saw a slight grey figure advancing across a spacioushall. His heart leapt. It was Helen Wotton. Behind and about her marched a riotof applause. The man in yellow came out of the nearer shadows into the circle oflight.“This is the girl who told us what Ostrog had done,” he said.Her face was aflame, and the heavy coils of her black hair fell about hershoulders. The folds of the soft silk robe she wore streamed from her andfloated in the rhythm of her advance. She drew nearer and nearer, and his heartwas beating fast. All his doubts were gone. The shadow of the doorway fellathwart her face and she was near him. “You have not betrayed us?” she cried.“You are with us?”“Where have you been?” said Graham.“At the office of the south-west wards. Until ten minutes since I did not knowyou had returned. I went to the office of the south-west wards to find the WardLeaders in order that they might tell the people.”“I came back so soon as I heard—”“I knew,” she cried, “knew you would be with us. And it was I—it was I that toldthem. They have risen. All the world is rising. The people have awakened. ThankGod that I did not act in vain! You are Master still.”“You told them,” he said slowly, and he saw that in spite of her steady eyes herlips trembled and her throat rose and fell.“I told them. I knew of the order. I was here. I heard that the negroes were tocome to London to guard you and to keep the people down—to keep you a prisoner.And I stopped it. I came out and told the people. And you are Master still.”Graham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras, the vast listening ears, andback to her face. “I am Master still,” he said slowly, and the swift rush of afleet of aëroplanes passed across his thoughts.“And you did this? You, who are the niece of Ostrog.”“For you,” she cried. “For you! That you for whom the world has waited shouldnot be cheated of your power.”Graham stood for a space, wordless, regarding her. His doubts and questioningshad fled before her presence. He remembered the things that he had meant to say.He faced the cameras again and the light about him grew brighter. He turnedagain towards her.“You have saved me,” he said; “you have saved my power. And the battle isbeginning. God knows what this night will see—but not dishonour.”He paused. He addressed himself to the unseen multitudes who stared upon himthrough those grotesque black eyes. At first he spoke slowly.“Men and women of the new age,” he said; “You have arisen to do battle for therace! . . . There is no easy victory before us.”He stopped to gather words. The thoughts that had been in his mind before shecame returned, but transfigured, no longer touched with the shadow of a possibleirrelevance. “This night is a beginning,” he cried. “This battle that is coming,this battle that rushes upon us to-night, is only a beginning. All your lives,it may be, you must fight. Take no thought though I am beaten, though I amutterly overthrown.”He found the thing in his mind too vague for words. He paused momentarily, andbroke into vague exhortations, and then a rush of speech came upon him. Muchthat he said was but the humanitarian commonplace of a vanished age, but theconviction of his voice touched it to vitality. He stated the case of the olddays to the people of the new age, to the woman at his side. “I come out of thepast to you,” he said, “with the memory of an age that hoped. My age was an ageof dreams—of beginnings, an age of noble hopes; throughout the world we had madean end of slavery; throughout the world we had spread the desire andanticipation that wars might cease, that all men and women might live nobly, infreedom and peace. . . . So we hoped in the days that are past. And what ofthose hopes? How is it with man after two hundred years?“Great cities, vast powers, a collective greatness beyond our dreams. For thatwe did not work, and that has come. But how is it with the little lives thatmake up this greater life? How is it with the common lives? As it has everbeen—sorrow and labour, lives cramped and unfulfilled, lives tempted by power,tempted by wealth, and gone to waste and folly. The old faiths have faded andchanged, the new faith—. Is there a new faith?”Things that he had long wished to believe, he found that he believed. He plungedat belief and seized it, and clung for a time at her level. He spoke gustily, inbroken incomplete sentences, but with all his heart and strength, of this newfaith within him. He spoke of the greatness of self-abnegation, of his belief inan immortal life of Humanity in which we live and move and have our being. Hisvoice rose and fell, and the recording appliances hummed their hurried applause,dim attendants watched him out of the shadow. Through all those doubtful placeshis sense of that silent spectator beside him sustained his sincerity. For a fewglorious moments he was carried away; he felt no doubt of his heroic quality, nodoubt of his heroic words, he had it all straight and plain. His eloquencelimped no longer. And at last he made an end to speaking. “Here and now,” hecried, “I make my will. All that is mine in the world I give to the people ofthe world. All that is mine in the world I give to the people of the world. Igive it to you, and myself I give to you. And as God wills, I will live for you,or I will die.”He ended with a florid gesture and turned about. He found the light of hispresent exaltation reflected in the face of the girl. Their eyes met; her eyeswere swimming with tears of enthusiasm. They seemed to be urged towards eachother. They clasped hands and stood gripped, facing one another, in an eloquentsilence. She whispered. “I knew,” she whispered. “I knew.” He could not speak,he crushed her hand in his. His mind was the theatre of gigantic passions.The man in yellow was beside them. Neither had noted his coming. He was sayingthat the south-west wards were marching. “I never expected it so soon,” hecried. “They have done wonders. You must send them a word to help them on theirway.”Graham dropped Helen’s hand and stared at him absentmindedly. Then with a starthe returned to his previous preoccupation about the flying stages.“Yes,” he said. “That is good, that is good.” He weighed a message. “Tellthem;—well done South West.”He turned his eyes to Helen Wotton again. His face expressed his strugglebetween conflicting ideas. “We must capture the flying stages,” he explained.“Unless we can do that they will land negroes. At all costs we must preventthat.”He felt even as he spoke that this was not what had been in his mind before theinterruption. He saw a touch of surprise in her eyes. She seemed about to speakand a shrill bell drowned her voice.It occurred to Graham that she expected him to lead these marching people, thatthat was the thing he had to do. He made the offer abruptly. He addressed theman in yellow, but he spoke to her. He saw her face respond. “Here I am doingnothing,” he said.“It is impossible,” protested the man in yellow. “It is a fight in a warren.Your place is here.”He explained elaborately. He motioned towards the room where Graham must wait,he insisted no other course was possible. “We must know where you are,” he said.“At any moment a crisis may arise needing your presence and decision.” The roomwas a luxurious little apartment with news machines and a broken mirror that hadonce been en rapport with the crow’s nest specula. It seemed a matter of courseto Graham that Helen should stop with him.A picture had drifted through his mind of such a vast dramatic struggle as themasses in the ruins had suggested. But here was no spectacular battle-field suchas he imagined. Instead was seclusion—and suspense. It was only as the afternoonwore on that he pieced together a truer picture of the fight that was raging,inaudibly and invisibly, within four miles of him, beneath the Roehampton stage.A strange and unprecedented contest it was, a battle that was a hundred thousandlittle battles, a battle in a sponge of ways and channels, fought out of sightof sky or sun under the electric glare, fought out in a vast confusion bymultitudes untrained in arms, led chiefly by acclamation, multitudes dulled bymindless labour and enervated by the tradition of two hundred years of servilesecurity against multitudes demoralised by lives of venial privilege and sensualindulgence. They had no artillery, no differentiation into this force or that;the only weapon on either side was the little green metal carbine, whose secretmanufacture and sudden distribution in enormous quantities had been one ofOstrog’s culminating moves against the Council. Few had had any experience withthis weapon, many had never discharged one, many who carried it came un-providedwith ammunition; never was wilder firing in the history of warfare. It was abattle of amateurs, a hideous experimental warfare, armed rioters fighting armedrioters, armed rioters swept forward by the words and fury of a song, by thetramping sympathy of their numbers, pouring in countless myriads towards thesmaller ways, the disabled lifts, the galleries slippery with blood, the hallsand passages choked with smoke, beneath the flying stages, to learn there whenretreat was hopeless the ancient mysteries of warfare. And overhead save for afew sharp-shooters upon the roof spaces and for a few bands and threads ofvapour that multiplied and darkened towards the evening, the day was a clearserenity. Ostrog it seems had no bombs at command and in all the earlier phasesof the battle the aëropiles played no part. Not the smallest cloud was there tobreak the empty brilliance of the sky. It seemed as though it held itself vacantuntil the aëroplanes should come.Ever and again there was news of these, drawing nearer, from this Mediterraneanport and then that, and presently from the south of France. But of the new gunsthat Ostrog had made and which were known to be in the city came no news inspite of Graham’s urgency, nor any report of successes from the dense felt offighting strands about the flying stages. Section after section of the LabourSocieties reported itself assembled, reported itself marching, and vanished fromknowledge into the labyrinth of that warfare. What was happening there? Even thebusy ward leaders did not know. In spite of the opening and closing of doors,the hasty messengers, the ringing of bells and the perpetual clitter-clack ofrecording implements, Graham felt isolated, strangely inactive, inoperative.Their isolation seemed at times the strangest, the most unexpected of all thethings that had happened since his awakening. It had something of the quality ofthat inactivity that comes in dreams. A tumult, the stupendous realisation of aworld struggle between Ostrog and himself, and then this confined quiet littleroom with its mouthpieces and bells and broken mirror!Now the door would be closed and they were alone together; they seemed sharplymarked off then from all the unprecedented world storm that rushed togetherwithout, vividly aware of one another, only concerned with one another. Then thedoor would open again, messengers would enter, or a sharp bell would stab theirquiet privacy, and it was like a window in a well built brightly lit house flungopen suddenly to a hurricane. The dark hurry and tumult, the stress andvehemence of the battle rushed in and overwhelmed them. They were no longerpersons but mere spectators, mere impressions of a tremendous convulsion. Theybecame unreal even to themselves, miniatures of personality, indescribablysmall, and the two antagonistic realities, the only realities in being werefirst the city, that throbbed and roared yonder in a belated frenzy of defenceand secondly the aëroplanes hurling inexorably towards them over the roundshoulder of the world.At first their mood had been one of exalted confidence, a great pride hadpossessed them, a pride in one another for the greatness of the issues they hadchallenged. At first he had walked the room eloquent with a transitorypersuasion of his tremendous destiny. But slowly uneasy intimations of theircoming defeat touched his spirit. There came a long period in which they werealone. He changed his theme, became egotistical, spoke of the wonder of hissleep, of the little life of his memories, remote yet minute and clear, likesomething seen through an inverted opera-glass, and all the brief play ofdesires and errors that had made his former life. She said little, but theemotion in her face followed the tones in his voice, and it seemed to him he hadat last a perfect understanding. He reverted from pure reminiscence to thatsense of greatness she imposed upon him. “And through it all, this destiny wasbefore me,” he said; “this vast inheritance of which I did not dream.”Insensibly their heroic preoccupation with the revolutionary struggle passed tothe question of their relationship. He began to question her. She told him ofthe days before his awakening, spoke with a brief vividness of the girlishdreams that had given a bias to her life, of the incredulous emotions hisawakening had aroused. She told him too of a tragic circumstance of her girlhoodthat had darkened her life, quickened her sense of injustice and opened herheart prematurely to the wider sorrows of the world. For a little time, so faras he was concerned, the great war about them was but the vast ennoblingbackground to these personal things.In an instant these personal relations were submerged. There came messengers totell that a great fleet of aëroplanes was rushing between the sky and Avignon.He went to the crystal dial in the corner and assured himself that the thing wasso. He went to the chart room and consulted a map to measure the distances ofAvignon, New Arawan and London. He made swift calculations. He went to the roomof the Ward Leaders to ask for news of the fight for the stages—and there was noone there. After a time he came back to her.His face had changed. It had dawned upon him that the struggle was perhaps morethan half over, that Ostrog was holding his own, that the arrival of theaëroplanes would mean a panic that might leave him helpless. A chance phrase inthe message had given him a glimpse of the reality that came. Each of thesesoaring giants bore its thousand half savage negroes to the death grapple of thecity. Suddenly his humanitarian enthusiasm showed flimsy. Only two of the WardLeaders were in their room, when presently he repaired thither, the Hall of theAtlas seemed empty. He fancied a change in the bearing of the attendants in theouter rooms. A sombre disillusionment darkened his mind. She looked at himanxiously when he returned to her.“No news,” he said with an assumed carelessness, in answer to her eyes.Then he was moved to frankness. “Or rather—bad news. We are losing. We aregaining no ground and the aëroplanes draw nearer and nearer.”He walked the length of the room and turned.“Unless we can capture those flying stages in the next hour— there will behorrible things. We shall be beaten.”“No!” she said. “We have justice—we have the people. We have God on our side.”“Ostrog has discipline—he has plans. Do you know, out there just now I felt—.When I heard that these aëroplanes were a stage nearer. I felt as if I werefighting the machinery of Fate.”She made no answer for a while. “We have done right,” she said at last.He looked at her doubtfully. “We have done what we could. But does this dependupon us? Is it not an older sin, a wider sin?”“What do you mean?” she asked.“These blacks are savages, ruled by force, used as force. And they have beenunder the rule of the whites two hundred years. Is it not a race quarrel? Therace sinned—the race pays.”“But these labourers, these poor people of London—!”“Vicarious atonement. To stand wrong is to share the guilt.”She looked keenly at him, astonished at the new aspect he presented.Without came the shrill ringing of a bell, the sound of feet and the gabble of aphonographic message. The man in yellow appeared. “Yes?” said Graham.“They are at Vichy.”“Where are the attendants who were in the great Hall of the Atlas?” asked Grahamabruptly.Presently the Babble Machine rang again. “We may win yet,” said the man inyellow, going out to it. “If only we can find where Ostrog has hidden his guns.Everything hangs on that now. Perhaps this—”Graham followed him. But the only news was of the aëroplanes. They had reachedOrleans.Graham returned to Helen. “No news,” he said. “No news.”“And we can do nothing?”“Nothing.”He paced impatiently. Suddenly the swift anger that was his nature swept uponhim. “Curse this complex world!” he cried, “and all the inventions of men! Thata man must die like a rat in a snare and never see his foe! Oh, for one blow! .. .”He turned with an abrupt change in his manner. “That’s nonsense,” he said. “I ama savage.”He paced and stopped. “After all London and Paris are only two cities. All thetemperate zone has risen. What if London is doomed and Paris destroyed? Theseare but accidents.” Again came the mockery of news to call him to freshenquiries. He returned with a graver face and sat down beside her.“The end must be near,” he said. “The people it seems have fought and died intens of thousands, the ways about Roehampton must be like a smoked beehive. Andthey have died in vain. They are still only at the sub stage. The aëroplanes arenear Paris. Even were a gleam of success to come now, there would be nothing todo, there would be no time to do anything before they were upon us. The gunsthat might have saved us are mislaid. Mislaid! Think of the disorder of things!Think of this foolish tumult, that cannot even find its weapons! Oh, for oneaëropile— just one! For the want of that I am beaten. Humanity is beaten and ourcause is lost! My kingship, my headlong foolish kingship will not last a night.And I have egged on the people to fight—.”“They would have fought anyhow.”“I doubt it. I have come among them—”“No,” she cried, “not that. If defeat comes—if you die—. But even that cannotbe, it cannot be, after all these years.”“Ah! We have meant well. But—do you indeed believe—?”“If they defeat you,” she cried, “you have spoken. Your word has gone like agreat wind through the world, fanning liberty into a flame. What if the flamesputters a little! Nothing can change the spoken word. Your message will havegone forth. . . .”“To what end? It may be. It may be. You know I said, when you told me of thesethings—dear God! but that was scarcely a score of hours ago!—I said that I hadnot your faith. Well—at any rate there is nothing to do now. . . .”“You have not my faith! Do you mean—? You are sorry ? ”“No,” he said hurriedly, “no! Before God—no!” His voice changed. “But—. Ithink—I have been indiscreet. I knew little— I grasped too hastily. . . .”He paused. He was ashamed of this avowal. “There is one thing that makes up forall. I have known you. Across this gulf of time I have come to you. The rest isdone. It is done. With you, too, it has been something more—or something less—”He paused with his face searching hers, and without clamoured the unheededmessage that the aëroplanes were rising into the sky of Amiens.She put her hand to her throat, and her lips were white. She stared before heras if she saw some horrible possibility. Suddenly her features changed. “Oh, butI have been honest!” she cried, and then, “ Have I been honest? I loved theworld and freedom, I hated cruelty and oppression. Surely it was that.”“Yes,” he said, “yes. And we have done what it lay in us to do. We have givenour message, our message! We have started Armageddon! But now—. Now that wehave, it may be our last hour, together, now that all these greater things aredone. . . .”He stopped. She sat in silence. Her face was a white riddle.For a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir outside, a running to and fro,and cries. Then Helen started to an attitude of tense attention. “It is—,” shecried and stood up, speechless, incredulous, triumphant. And Graham, too, heard.Metallic voices were shouting “Victory!” Yes it was “Victory!” He stood up alsowith the light of a desperate hope in his eyes.Bursting through the curtains appeared the man in yellow, startled anddishevelled with excitement. “Victory,” he cried, “victory! The people arewinning. Ostrog’s people have collapsed.”She rose. “Victory?” And her voice was hoarse and faint.“What do you mean?” asked Graham. “Tell me! What? ”“We have driven them out of the under galleries at Norwood, Streatham is afireand burning wildly, and Roehampton is ours. Ours! —and we have taken theaëropile that lay thereon.”For an instant Graham and Helen stood in silence, their hearts were beatingfast, they looked at one another. For one last moment there gleamed in Grahamhis dream of empire, of kingship, with Helen by his side. It gleamed, andpassed.A shrill bell rang. An agitated grey-headed man appeared from the room of theWard Leaders. “It is all over,” he cried.“What matters it now that we have Roehampton? The aëroplanes have been sightedat Boulogne!”“The Channel!” said the man in yellow. He calculated swiftly. “Half an hour.”“They still have three of the flying stages,” said the old man.“Those guns?” cried Graham.“We cannot mount them—in half an hour.”“Do you mean they are found?”“Too late,” said the old man.“If we could stop them another hour!” cried the man in yellow.“Nothing can stop them now,” said the old man.“They have near a hundred aëroplanes in the first fleet.”“Another hour?” asked Graham.“To be so near!” said the Ward Leader. “Now that we have found those guns. To beso near—. If once we could get them out upon the roof spaces.”“How long would that take?” asked Graham suddenly.“An hour—certainly.”“Too late,” cried the Ward Leader, “too late.”“Is it too late?” said Graham. “Even now—. An hour!”He had suddenly perceived a possibility. He tried to speak calmly, but his facewas white. “There is one chance. You said there was an aëropile—?”“On the Roehampton stage, Sire.”“Smashed?”“No. It is lying crossways to the carrier. It might be got upon theguides—easily. But there is no aëronaut—.”Graham glanced at the two men and then at Helen. He spoke after a long pause.“We have no aëronauts?”“None.”“The aëroplanes are clumsy,” he said thoughtfully, “compared with theaëropiles.”He turned suddenly to Helen. His decision was made. “I must do it.”“Do what?”“Go to this flying stage—to this aëropile.”“What do you mean?”“I am an aëronaut. After all—. Those days for which you reproached me were notaltogether wasted.”He turned to the old man in yellow. “Tell them to put the aëropile upon theguides.”The man in yellow hesitated.“What do you mean to do?” cried Helen.“This aëropile—it is a chance—.”“You don’t mean—?”“To fight—yes. To fight in the air. I have thought before—. An aëroplane is aclumsy thing. A resolute man—!”“But—never since flying began—” cried the man in yellow.“There has been no need. But now the time has come. Tell them now—send them mymessage—to put it upon the guides.”The old man dumbly interrogated the man in yellow, nodded, and hurried out.Helen made a step towards Graham. Her face was white. “But—How can one fight?You will be killed.”“Perhaps. Yet, not to do it—or to let someone else attempt it—.”He stopped, he could speak no more, he swept the alternative aside by a gesture,and they stood looking at one another.“You are right,” she said at last in a low tone. “You are right. If it can bedone. . . . You must go.”He moved a step towards her, and she stepped back, her white face struggledagainst him and resisted him. “No,” she gasped. “I cannot bear—. Go now.”He extended his hands stupidly. She clenched her fists. “Go now,” she cried. “Gonow.”He hesitated and understood. He threw his hands up in a queer half-theatricalgesture. He had no word to say. He turned from her.The man in yellow moved towards the door with clumsy belated tact. But Grahamstepped past him. He went striding through the room where the Ward Leader bawledat a telephone directing that the aëropile should be put upon the guides.The man in yellow glanced at Helen’s still figure, hesitated and hurried afterhim. Graham did not once look back, he did not speak until the curtain of theante-chamber of the great Hall fell behind him. Then he turned his head withcurt swift directions upon his bloodless lips."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24THE COMING OF THE AËROPLANESTwo men in pale blue were lying in the irregular line that stretched along theedge of the captured Roehampton stage from end to end, grasping their carbinesand peering into the shadows of the stage called Wimbledon Park. Now and thenthey spoke to one another. They spoke the mutilated English of their class andperiod. The fire of the Ostrogites had dwindled and ceased, and few of the enemyhad been seen for some time. But the echoes of the fight that was going on nowfar below in the lower galleries of that stage, came every now and then betweenthe staccato of shots from the popular side. One of these men was describing tothe other how he had seen a man down below there dodge behind a girder, and hadaimed at a guess and hit him cleanly as he dodged too far. “He’s down therestill,” said the marksman. “See that little patch. Yes. Between those bars.” Afew yards behind them lay a dead stranger, face upward to the sky, with the bluecanvas of his jacket smouldering in a circle about the neat bullet hole on hischest. Close beside him a wounded man, with a leg swathed about, sat with anexpressionless face and watched the progress of that burning. Gigantic behindthem, athwart the carrier lay the captured aëropile.“I can’t see him now,” said the second man in a tone of provocation.The marksman became foul-mouthed and high-voiced in his earnest endeavour tomake things plain. And suddenly, interrupting him, came a noisy shouting fromthe substage.“What’s going on now,” he said, and raised himself on one arm to stare at thestairheads in the central groove of the stage. A number of blue figures werecoming up these, and swarming across the stage to the aëropile.“We don’t want all these fools,” said his friend. “They only crowd up and spoilshots. What are they after?”“Ssh!—they’re shouting something.”The two men listened. The swarming new comers had crowded densely about theaëropile. Three Ward Leaders, conspicuous by their black mantles and badges,clambered into the body and appeared above it. The rank and file flungthemselves upon the vans, gripping hold of the edges, until the entire outlineof the thing was manned, in some places three deep. One of the marksmen kneltup. “They’re putting it on the carrier— that’s what they’re after.”He rose to his feet, his friend rose also. “What’s the good?” said his friend.“We’ve got no aëronauts.”“That’s what they’re doing anyhow.” He looked at his rifle, looked at thestruggling crowd, and suddenly turning to the wounded man. “Mind these, mate,”he said, handing his carbine and cartridge belt; and in a moment he was runningtowards the aëropile. For a quarter of an hour he was a perspiring Titan,lugging, thrusting, shouting and heeding shouts, and then the thing was done,and he stood with a multitude of others cheering their own achievement. By thistime he knew, what indeed everyone in the city knew, that the Master, rawlearner though he was, intended to fly this machine himself, was coming even nowto take control of it, would let no other man attempt it. “He who takes thegreatest danger, he who bears the heaviest burthen, that man is King,” so theMaster was reported to have spoken. And even as this man cheered, and while thebeads of sweat still chased one another from the disorder of his hair, he heardthe thunder of a greater tumult, and in fitful snatches the beat and impulse ofthe revolutionary song. He saw through a gap in the people that a thick streamof heads still poured up the stairway. “The Master is coming,” shouted voices,“the Master is coming,” and the crowd about him grew denser and denser. He beganto thrust himself towards the central groove. “The Master is coming!” “TheSleeper, the Master!” “God and the Master!” roared the voices.And suddenly quite close to him were the black uniforms of the revolutionaryguard, and for the first and last time in his life he saw Graham, saw him quitenearly. A tall, dark man in a flowing black robe, with a white, resolute faceand eyes fixed steadfastly before him; a man who for all the little things abouthim had neither ears nor eyes nor thoughts. . . . For all his days that manremembered the passing of Graham’s bloodless face. In a moment it had gone andhe was fighting in the swaying crowd. A lad weeping with terror thrust againsthim, pressing towards the stairways, yelling “Clear for the aëropile!” The bellthat clears the flying stage became a loud unmelodious clanging.With that clanging in his ears Graham drew near the aëropile, marched into theshadow of its tilting wing. He became aware that a number of people about himwere offering to accompany him, and waved their offers aside. He wanted to thinkhow one started the engine. The bell clanged faster and faster, and the feet ofthe retreating people roared faster and louder. The man in yellow was assistinghim to mount through the ribs of the body. He clambered into the aëronaut’splace, fixing himself very carefully and deliberately. What was it? The man inyellow was pointing to two aëropiles driving upward in the southern sky. Nodoubt they were looking for the coming aëroplanes. That—presently—the thing todo now was to start. Things were being shouted at him, questions, warnings. Theybothered him. He wanted to think about the aëropile, to recall every item of hisprevious experience. He waved the people from him, saw the man in yellowdropping off through the ribs, saw the crowd cleft down the line of the girdersby his gesture.For a moment he was motionless, staring at the levers, the wheel by which theengine shifted, and all the delicate appliances of which he knew so little. Hiseye caught a spirit level with the bubble towards him, and he rememberedsomething, spent a dozen seconds in swinging the engine forward until the bubblefloated in the centre of the tube. He noted that the people were not shouting,knew they watched his deliberation. A bullet smashed on the bar above his head.Who fired? Was the line clear of people? He stood up to see and sat down again.In another second the propeller was spinning, and he was rushing down theguides. He gripped the wheel and swung the engine back to lift the stem. Then itwas the people shouted. In a moment he was throbbing with the quiver of theengine, and the shouts dwindled swiftly behind, rushed down to silence. The windwhistled over the edges of the screen, and the world sank away from him veryswiftly.Throb, throb, throb—throb, throb, throb; up he drove. He fancied himself free ofall excitement, felt cool and deliberate. He lifted the stem still more, openedone valve on his left wing and swept round and up. He looked down with a steadyhead, and up. One of the Ostrogite aëropiles was driving across his course, sothat he drove obliquely towards it and would pass below it at a steep angle. Itslittle aëronauts were peering down at him. What did they mean to do? His mindbecame active. One, he saw held a weapon pointing, seemed prepared to fire. Whatdid they think he meant to do? In a moment he understood their tactics, and hisresolution was taken. His momentary lethargy was past. He opened two more valvesto his left, swung round, end on to this hostile machine, closed his valves, andshot straight at it, stem and wind-screen shielding him from the shot. Theytilted a little as if to clear him. He flung up his stem.Throb, throb, throb—pause—throb, throb—he set his teeth, his face into aninvoluntary grimace, and crash! He struck it! He struck upward beneath thenearer wing.Very slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to broaden as the impetus of hisblow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then it slid downward outof his sight.He felt his stem going down, his hands tightened on the levers, whirled andrammed the engine back. He felt the jerk of a clearance, the nose of the machinejerked upward steeply, and for a moment he seemed to be lying on his back. Themachine was reeling and staggering, it seemed to be dancing on its screw. Hemade a huge effort, hung for a moment on the levers, and slowly the engine cameforward again. He was driving upward but no longer so steeply. He gasped for amoment and flung himself at the levers again. The wind whistled about him. Onefurther effort and he was almost level. He could breathe. He turned his head forthe first time to see what had become of his antagonists. Turned back to thelevers for a moment and looked again. For a moment he could have believed theywere annihilated. And then he saw between the two stages to the east was achasm, and down this something, a slender edge, fell swiftly and vanished, as asixpence falls down a crack.At first he did not understand, and then a wild joy possessed him. He shouted atthe top of his voice, an inarticulate shout, and drove higher and higher up thesky. Throb, throb, throb, pause, throb, throb, throb. “Where was the otheraëropile?” he thought. “They too—.” As he looked round the empty heavens he hada momentary fear that this machine had risen above him, and then he saw italighting on the Norwood stage. They had meant shooting. To risk being rammedheadlong two thousand feet in the air was beyond their latter-day courage. Thecombat was declined.For a little while he circled, then swooped in a steep descent towards thewestward stage. Throb throb throb, throb throb throb. The twilight was creepingon apace, the smoke from the Streatham stage that had been so dense and dark,was now a pillar of fire, and all the laced curves of the moving ways and thetranslucent roofs and domes and the chasms between the buildings were glowingsoftly now, lit by the tempered radiance of the electric light that the glare ofthe day overpowered. The three efficient stages that the Ostrogites held—forWimbledon Park was useless because of the fire from Roehampton, and Streathamwas a furnace—were glowing with guide lights for the coming aëroplanes. As heswept over the Roehampton stage he saw the dark masses of the people thereon. Heheard a clap of frantic cheering, heard a bullet from the Wimbledon Park stagetweet through the air, and went beating up above the Surrey wastes. He felt abreath of wind from the south-west, and lifted his westward wing as he hadlearnt to do, and so drove upward heeling into the rare swift upper air. Throbthrob throb—throb throb throb.Up he drove and up, to that pulsating rhythm, until the country beneath was blueand indistinct, and London spread like a little map traced in light, like themere model of a city near the brim of the horizon. The south-west was a sky ofsapphire over the shadowy rim of the world, and ever as he drove upward themultitude of stars increased.And behold! In the southward, low down and glittering swiftly nearer, were twolittle patches of nebulous light. And then two more, and then a nebulous glow ofswiftly driving shapes. Presently he could count them. There were four andtwenty. The first fleet of aëroplanes had come! Beyond appeared a yet greaterglow.He swept round in a half circle, staring at this advancing fleet. It flew in awedge-like shape, a triangular flight of gigantic phosphorescent shapes sweepingnearer through the lower air. He made a swift calculation of their pace, andspun the little wheel that brought the engine forward. He touched a lever andthe throbbing effort of the engine ceased. He began to fall, fell swifter andswifter. He aimed at the apex of the wedge. He dropped like a stone through thewhistling air. It seemed scarce a second from that soaring moment before hestruck the foremost aëroplane.No man of all that black multitude saw the coming of his fate, no man among themdreamt of the hawk that struck downward upon him out of the sky. Those who werenot limp in the agonies of air-sickness, were craning their black necks andstaring to see the filmy city that was rising out of the haze, the rich andsplendid city to which “Massa Boss” had brought their obedient muscles. Brightteeth gleamed and the glossy faces shone. They had heard of Paris. They knewthey were to have lordly times among the “poor white” trash. And suddenly Grahamstruck them.He had aimed at the body of the aëroplane, but at the very last instant a betteridea had flashed into his mind. He twisted about and struck near the edge of thestarboard wing with all his accumulated weight. He was jerked back as he struck.His prow went gliding across its smooth expanse towards the rim. He felt theforward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his aëropile along with it, andfor a moment that seemed an age he could not tell what was happening. He heard athousand throats yelling, and perceived that his machine was balanced on theedge of the gigantic float, and driving down, down; glanced over his shoulderand saw the backbone of the aëroplane and the opposite float swaying up. He hada vision through the ribs of sliding chairs, staring faces, and hands clutchingat the tilting guide bars. The fenestrations in the further float flashed openas the aëronaut tried to right her. Beyond, he saw a second aëroplane leapingsteeply to escape the whirl of its heeling fellow. The broad area of swayingwings seemed to jerk upward. He felt his aëropile had dropped clear, that themonstrous fabric, clean overturned, hung like a sloping wall above him.He did not clearly understand that he had struck the side float of the aëroplaneand slipped off, but he perceived that he was flying free on the down glide andrapidly nearing earth. What had he done? His heart throbbed like a noisy enginein his throat and for a perilous instant he could not move his levers because ofthe paralysis of his hands. He wrenched the levers to throw his engine back,fought for two seconds against the weight of it, felt himself righting, drivinghorizontally, set the engine beating again.He looked upward and saw two aëroplanes glide shouting far overhead, lookedback, and saw the main body of the fleet opening out and rushing upward andoutward; saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on and strike like a giganticknife-blade along the wind-wheels below it.He put down his stern and looked again. He drove up heedless of his direction ashe watched. He saw the wind-vanes give, saw the huge fabric strike the earth,saw its downward vans crumple with the weight of its descent, and then the wholemass turned over and smashed, upside down, upon the sloping wheels. Throb,throb, throb, pause. Suddenly from the heaving wreckage a thin tongue of whitefire licked up towards the zenith. And then he was aware of a huge mass flyingthrough the air towards him, and turned upwards just in time to escape thecharge—if it was a charge—of a second aëroplane. It whirled by below, sucked himdown a fathom, and nearly turned him over in the gust of its close passage.He became aware of three others rushing towards him, aware of the urgentnecessity of beating above them. Aëroplanes were all about him, circling wildlyto avoid him, as it seemed. They drove past him, above, below, eastward andwestward. Far away to the westward was the sound of a collision, and two fallingflares. Far away to the southward a second squadron was coming. Steadily he beatupward. Presently all the aëroplanes were below him, but for a moment he doubtedthe height he had of them, and did not swoop again. And then he came down upon asecond victim and all its load of soldiers saw him coming. The big machineheeled and swayed as the fear-maddened men scrambled to the stern for theirweapons. A score of bullets sung through the air, and there flashed a star inthe thick glass wind-screen that protected him. The aëroplane slowed and droppedto foil his stroke, and dropped too low. Just in time he saw the wind-wheels ofBromley hill rushing up towards him, and spun about and up as the aëroplane hehad chased crashed among them. All its voices wove into a felt of yelling. Thegreat fabric seemed to be standing on end for a second among the heeling andsplintering vans, and then it flew to pieces. Huge splinters came flying throughthe air, its engines burst like shells. A hot rush of flame shot overhead intothe darkling sky.“Two!” he cried, with a bomb from overhead bursting as it fell, and forthwith hewas beating up again. A glorious exhilaration possessed him now, a giantactivity. His troubles about humanity, about his inadequacy, were gone for ever.He was a man in battle rejoicing in his power. Aëroplanes seemed radiating fromhim in every direction, intent only upon avoiding him, the yelling of theirpacked passengers came in short gusts as they swept by. He chose his thirdquarry, struck hastily and did but turn it on edge. It escaped him, to smashagainst the tall cliff of London wall. Flying from that impact he skimmed thedarkling ground so nearly he could see a frightened rabbit bolting up a slope.He jerked up steeply, and found himself driving over south London with the airabout him vacant. To the right of him a wild riot of signal rockets from theOstrogites banged tumultuously in the sky. To the south the wreckage of half adozen air ships flamed, and east and west and north the air ships fled beforehim. They drove away to the east and north, and went about in the south, forthey could not pause in the air. In their present confusion any attempt atevolution would have meant disastrous collisions. He could scarcely realize thething he had done. In every quarter aëroplanes were receding. They werereceding. They dwindled smaller and smaller. They were in flight!He passed two hundred feet or so above the Roehampton stage. It was black withpeople and noisy with their frantic shouting. But why was the Wimbledon Parkstage black and cheering, too? The smoke and flame of Streatham now hid thethree further stages. He curved about and rose to see them and the northernquarters. First came the square masses of Shooter’s Hill into sight from behindthe smoke, lit and orderly with the aëroplane that had landed and itsdisembarking negroes. Then came Blackheath, and then under the corner of thereek the Norwood stage. On Blackheath no aëroplane had landed but an aëropilelay upon the guides. Norwood was covered by a swarm of little figures running toand fro in a passionate confusion. Why? Abruptly he understood. The stubborndefence of the flying stages was over, the people were pouring into theunderways of these last strongholds of Ostrog’s usurpation. And then, from faraway on the northern border of the city, full of glorious import to him, came asound, a signal, a note of triumph, the leaden thud of a gun. His lips fellapart, his face was disturbed with emotion.He drew an immense breath. “They win,” he shouted to the empty air; “the peoplewin!” The sound of a second gun came like an answer. And then he saw theaëropile on Blackheath was running down its guides to launch. It lifted cleanand rose. It shot up into the air, driving straight southward and away from him.In an instant it came to him what this meant. It must needs be Ostrog in flight.He shouted and dropped towards it. He had the momentum of his elevation and fellslanting down the air and very swiftly. It rose steeply at his approach. Heallowed for its velocity and drove straight upon it.It suddenly became a mere flat edge, and behold! he was past it, and drivingheadlong down with all the force of his futile blow.He was furiously angry. He reeled the engine back along its shaft and wentcircling up. He saw Ostrog’s machine beating up a spiral before him. He rosestraight towards it, won above it by virtue of the impetus of his swoop and bythe advantage and weight of a man. He dropped headlong—dropped and missed again!As he rushed past he saw the face of Ostrog’s aëronaut confident and cool and inOstrog’s attitude a wincing resolution. Ostrog was looking steadfastly away fromhim—to the south. He realized with a gleam of wrath how bungling his flight mustbe. Below he saw the Croyden hills. He jerked upward and once more he gained onhis enemy.He glanced over his shoulder and his attention was arrested by a strange thing.The eastward stage, the one on Shooter’s Hill, appeared to lift; a flashchanging to a tall grey shape, a cowled figure of smoke and duct, jerked intothe air. For a moment this cowled figure stood motionless, dropping huge massesof metal from its shoulders, and then it began to uncoil a dense head of smoke.The people had blown it up, aëroplane and all! As suddenly a second flash andgrey shape sprang up from the Norwood stage. And even as he stared at this camea dead report, and the air wave of the first explosion struck him. He was flungup and sideways.For a moment the aëropile fell nearly edgewise with her nose down, and seemed tohesitate whether to overset altogether. He stood on his wind-shield wrenchingthe wheel that swayed up over his head. And then the shock of the secondexplosion took his machine sideways.He found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his machine, and the air wasblowing past him and upward. He seemed to be hanging quite still in the air,with the wind blowing up past him. It occurred to him that he was falling. Thenhe was sure that he was falling. He could not look down.He found himself recapitulating with incredible swiftness all that had happenedsince his awakening, the days of doubt, the days of Empire, and at last thetumultuous discovery of Ostrog’s calculated treachery. He was beaten but Londonwas saved. London was saved!The thought had a quality of utter unreality. Who was he? Why was he holding sotightly with his hands? Why could he not leave go? In such a fall as thiscountless dreams have ended. But in a moment he would wake. . . .His thoughts ran swifter and swifter. He wondered if he should see Helen again.It seemed so unreasonable that he should not see her again. It must be a dream!Yet surely he would meet her. She at least was real. She was real. He would wakeand meet her.Although he could not look at it, he was suddenly aware that the earth was verynear."},{"pageContent":"READING GROUP GUIDEimage [images/Well_9780307432872_epub_003_r1.jpg]1. Some critics categorize Wells as a utopian whose works, while idealistic, arealso pessimistic. Wells’s pessimism is quite evident, but what of his idealism?Can he in fact be classified as a utopian?2. Carlo Pagetti, an Italian literary critic, argues that Wells did not create anew genre but rather slightly modified traditional literary devices such as theconcept of a utopia, time travel, and alien visitors. Do you agree? If yes, howdoes When the Sleeper Wakes fit into traditional literature?3. Some have criticized Wells for his overtly religious parodies in his novelssuch as The Island of Dr. Moreau and The War in the Air. Does When the SleeperWakes differ at all from these earlier novels? Obviously the new society Grahamawakes to hails him as a messiah, but is he what modern readers would refer toas a Christlike figure?4. In Wells’s previous novels his themes and outcomes are somewhat obvious— TheTime Machine was a play on the hierarchy of social class, The Island of Dr.Moreau was a comment on the possible pitfalls of bioengineering. Some believethe theme of this book deals with Victorians’ inheritance laws and the ills thatWells thought would come from such laws; others believe Wells was commenting onthe division of capital and labor. Do you agree with either theory? If not, whatdo you think is the theme of this book?5. In his book H. G. Wells J. D. Beresford talks of Wells’s turn from the“traditional” science fiction, such as Jules Verne wrote, to an overtlymoralistic storytelling, When the Sleeper Wakes being the first in thisexperiment. Do you think Wells is overly moralistic? Do you believe none ofWells’s contemporaries had overhanging themes in their own works?"},{"pageContent":"THE MODERN LIBRARY EDITORIAL BOARDMaya AngelouDaniel J. BoorstinA. S.

WELLSHerbert George Wells—novelist, social critic, and visionary futurist who becameone of the most prolific and widely read writers of his generation—was born inthe London suburb of Bromley, Kent, on September 21, 1866. He came from alower-middle-class background and grew up in circumstances of genteel povertythat would not have seemed out of place in a novel by Dickens. His father was atvarious times a gardener, professional cricket player, and shopkeeper; hismother was a house-keeper and former lady’s maid. The youngster, nicknamedBertie, became an avid reader at the age of seven while lying bedridden with abroken leg.Although he left school to become a draper’s apprentice at fourteen, Wells laterwon a scholarship to the Royal College of Science in South Kensington. There hestudied zoology under T. H. Huxley, a noted disciple of Darwin who instilled inWells a belief in social as well as biological evolution. Wells’s firstprophetic work, “A Tale of the Twentieth Century,” was published in 1887 in theScience Schools Journal. Upon graduation from the University of London in 1890he was a tutor until chronic ill-health made him decide to make a seriousattempt at being a writer. He brought out A Text-Book of Biology (1893) andbegan contributing articles and fiction to magazines such as the Pall MallGazette. Impoverished and unhappily married, Wells eloped with Amy Catherine(“Jane”) Robbins, a former student of his, whom he later married and by whom hehad two sons.The serialization of The Time Machine in 1895 made Wells famous overnight. Astring of other scientific romances—including The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896),The Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), When the Sleeper Wakes(1899), and The First Men in the Moon (1901)—consolidated his reputation.A socialist who believed in the perfectibility of mankind, Wells focused onutopian social and political themes in works of nonfiction beginning withAnticipations (1901), The Discovery of the Future (1902), Mankind in the Making(1903), A Modern Utopia (1905), and The Future in America (1906). Wells joinedthe Fabian Society in 1903 but left after fighting an unsuccessful war of witand rhetoric over its policies with George Bernard Shaw.Tired of being labeled “the English Jules Verne,” Wells wrote two popular comicnovels featuring resilient Cockney heroes who triumph over adversity, Kipps(1905) and The History of Mr. Polly (1910). The latter underscored one of hismost basic themes: “If the world does not please you, you can change it.” Aliaison with the young Fabian Amber Reeves inspired the novel Ann Veronica(1909) and produced a daughter, Anna Jane. Also published in 1909 wasTono-Bungay, a panoramic if scathing view of Edwardian England that many regardas his greatest novel.Wells’s later fiction became increasingly autobiographical. The New Machiavelli(1911) and the best-selling Mr. Bristling Sees It Through (1916) were the mostnotable. Others, such as Marriage (1912), prompted a young journalist namedRebecca West to dismiss him as the “old maid among novelists.” Yet the twoconducted a ten-year love affair and had a son, Anthony West. Wells continued toproduce compelling prognostications. Despite having dubbed World War I “the warthat will end war,” he wrote The World Set Free (1914), a speculative history ofthe future that predicted the coming age of nuclear warfare.In 1920 The Outline of History, an encyclopedic work written to further thecause of world peace, brought Wells to the height of his fame. An internationalbestseller, the book included this memorable saying: “Human history becomes moreand more a race between education and catastrophe.” The same year he traveled toRussia to meet Lenin and reported on the new Communist regime in Russia in theShadows (1920).In 1923 Wells ended his relationship with Rebecca West and later moved to thesouth of France with his new mistress, political exile Odette Keun. There hewrote The World of William Clissold (1926), his most ambitious novel of theperiod. Upon returning to London in 1930 Wells brought out The Science of Life(1930) and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (1932), two companionvolumes to The Outline of History.With the rise of fascism Wells became less optimistic about the future, and inThe Shape of Things to Come (1933) he accurately predicted a second world warthat would begin in 1939. However, he journeyed to the United States and Russiain 1934, attempting to promote global peace. Back in England he published hismemoirs, the masterful two-volume Experiment in Autobiography (1934), and workedwith Alexander Korda on a film version of The Shape of Things to Come. Thoughhappily involved with Moura Budberg, the Russian spy who was his last companion,Wells remained fatalistic about mankind. The advent of World War II onlyheightened the author’s despondency as he lived to see many of his direpredictions come true. “Reality has taken a leaf from my book and set itself tosupersede me,” he bitterly observed. A final work, Mind at the End of Its Tether(1945), bleakly foretold the destruction of civilization.H. G. Wells died suddenly and peacefully on August 13, 1946, just a few weeksbefore turning eighty, at his home in Hanover Terrace, London. Three days laterhis body was cremated and the ashes scattered over the English Channel near theIsle of Wight. A third volume of autobiography, H G. Wells in Love, appearedposthumously in 1984."},{"pageContent":"2003 Modern Library Paperback EditionIntroduction copyright © 2003 by Orson Scott CardReading group guide copyright © 2003 by Random House, Inc.Biographical note copyright © 1996 by Random House, Inc.All rights reserved under International and Pan-American CopyrightConventions.
